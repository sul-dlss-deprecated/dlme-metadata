Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 18.) Constantinople, December ]3, 1911 (No. 922.) Sir, IN my despatch No. 876 of the 29th November, I had the honour to report that the Bagdad Bailway Company was engaged in negotiations with the Porte, the object of which was to obtain an alteration of the original trace of the line between Mosul and Bagdad, as laid down in the concession of 1903 to a new alignment, which would pass through the district of Suleimanieh to Khanikin on the Persian frontier, and thence to Bagdad. In itself the detour is almost trifling, and seems at first glance to be unimportant, but I venture to think that on closer examination it will be recognised that if it becomes a fact, a situation will be created which will have grave consequences for our interests. From the German point of view the change has several manifest advantages, but, so far as we are concerned, it seems that their main object is to obtain command of the traffic between Bagdad and Khanikin. If the new trace is adopted we may safely assume that the line from Bagdad to Khanikin will be open in a very short period, and in that case our transit trade to Persia, reaching Bagdad by river, will be conveyed thence to Khanikin by the new line ; if we could place any faith in the fairness of the German management, the improved transport should be of benefit to trade in general, but I am personally quite convinced that such confidence would he misplaced, and that experience would prove that while every sort of facility was shown to German trade over the German rail, so every kind of obstruction and discrimination would be practised against our merchants. It may, of course, be argued that this would only be temporary, and that the construction of the contemplated “ international ’ Ottoman Company’s line from Bussorah to Bagdad would, as the Board of Trade believe, put an end to such discrimination; but, with all deference to the expert opinion of that department, I am personally unable to entertain any such hope, and I am convinced that means will always be found by ttie Germans to favour their own trade at the expense of ours. However that may be, the fact remains that ior a certain period, i.e., until the Bagdad-Gulf section of the railway is built, and built under conditions intended to ensure us the administrative control, and to secure us against unfair treatment on through traffic, our trade must be very much at the mercy of the Germans, and during this period the Germans may succeed m gaining a foothold at our expense, from which it will not be easy to dislodge them. If, on the other hand, the original concession of 1903 is maintained, our trade will for a time also suffer, but as the bianch from Sadijeh will in the nature of things not be constructed so soon as the trunk line to Khanikin, the period of unfair treatment will be shorter. Moreover, so long as there is no direct railway from Bagdad to Khainkin, there is alwajs the possibility that such a line may be constructed by the new company, which is to undeitake the Bagdad—Gulf section, and in which we hope to obtain a controlling interest. So far for the direct consequences to our interests; but I apprehend that the indirect may be more far-reaching in the long run. They are, however, in the nature of things, more difficult to define, and I do not propose to cio more than indicate their general character. The first is that if the new alignment is agreed to, we must be prepared to see the development of the petroliferous fields around Suleimameh fall into German hands. Mr. D’Arcy appears to have lost interest in the concession, and, failing any other British interest, it would be strange it with German engineers constantly surveying the country German capital were not attracted to the prospect of its exploitation ; moreover, the financiers who control the Bagdad Bailway Company have already interested themselves in the matter, and their attention to it has probably revived. A larcm increase of German influences in these regions is therefore to be apprehended, and it could not of course fail to act prejudicially on our own position. To a certain extent this danger already exists, but it would be certainly increased and be made more imminent if the German railway is to traverse these petroleum fields. Acrain the diversion of the line from the old trace implies that the moment w hen the [2294 s—4]rr 1 m j +Wpfore the circumstances foreseen iu German railway will reach Khamkm, an w ^ bought materially nearer. I do not the Potsdam agreement come into exlst ’ results w iH be. but I cannot believe that venture to predict with any precision w moment is deferred the they will be to our advantage, and therefore tne long better. _ T i v • i interests require that we should take some In these circumstances, I thm ^ c + p P ino- reached without our knowledge and action to prevent any further arrangemen » p 0 rte It will be within your consent, between the German Compan) and P ^ Ambassador and I recollection that in not very dissimilar ' s “vent a surprise in the nature of recommended (my telegram No. e s ?■) . ’ . inform the Porte in firm language the Potsdam agreement we should be “t h e negotiations theii going that our Governments desned to e con Ottoman Government.

We have, I submit, valid and legitimate grounds for intervention On the one hand, the Turks have submitted to us proposals for the settlement of the Bagdad Railway question on the basis of the situation which would be created by the German agreement of March last. Negotiations are presumably imminent on that basis and it is not therefore legitimate for the Turks to enter into any arrangement which would alter that basis without our knowledge and assent.. No mention of the 4 per cent need be made, as that question is reserved as a condition of a satisfactory solution of the main issue. The Germans, on the other hand, as it seems to me, much as they will dislike it, will have no plausible pretext for objecting to our action, for they have by their agreement of last March substantially recognised our interests m the Bagdad Bailway question, and, that being so, they should be precluded fioni disputing oui ngi to be kept informed of all negotiations that may affect our interests in that question, or to raise objections to a modiffcation of the status quo. .

H i showed this letter to the Ambassador and after talking the matter over with him, I thought it desirable to give an affirmative answer. I am expecting to receive shortly the 'Imperial Irade' confirming this new appoint ment. I have stipulated that the control of the Customs shall remain in my hands. The reorganisation of the Customs is now so far advanced that the general routine is established and working fairly well on the new system. The reformation Oi. the stair is also well on the way. I have drawn up and issued in French and Turkish a handbook of regulations and instructions for all ordinary Customs formalities and 1 have trained an eificient corps of Inspectors. 1 am hopeful, therefore, that my work of control will become less onerous in detail and that 1 may be able to give a larger measure of assistance in dealing with questions of State finance. I have completed the draft of a Specific Tariff and this will form the basis for the negotiations in connexion witnwith the new Treaty of Commerce with Austria Hungary. The preliminary meeting of the Turkish delegates (I am acting as one) will take place next week. The Turkish Government is anxious to replace txieir present 'ad valorem* system by a ’’speciiic tariff”, and this desire is not unreasonable. An ’’ao, valorem” system entails serious disadvantages from an administrative standpoint, and the uniform !, ad valorem” system in force nor© is, in its rigidity, singularly defective as an instrument for international commercial negotiations. The specific tariff upon which 1 have been engaged is designed primarily for revenue purposes. It is not intended to impose protective rates on manufactured articles or articles of large consumption. The economic condition of the country is, indeed, not such as would justify the imposition of protective duties on goods of that description. A simple specific tariff for revenue purposes is, however, in my view, necessary for the consolidation of the financial and commercial interests of the country, and it will remove many of the ' V 1 v difficulties which exporters now experience in relation to the valuation of their goods.1 want to be brief, but there is one other po int which may be of interest to Sir S. Grey. For some time I have had under consideration plans for the construction °f a new Custom House and bonded warehouses at Bagdad. Under the Bagdad Railway Concession (Articles 23 and 24) the Company has powers to construct a port and warehouses at Bagdad (also at Bassorah). I have therefore advised the Government not to embark upon an expensive scheme of building Customs depots at Bagdad without first ascertaining the intentions oi the Railway Company as to the exercise of their powers under tne concession. It is obviously desirable that the Customs buildings should be in proximity to the port and to the railway depots. 1 have recently discussed this matter with the Director General of the Company and it is not improbable that an arrangement may be made for the Company to construct the Customs buildings in return for a concession to exploit the bonded warehouses and transit depots under the control of the Customs Administration. I have mentioned this matter to the Ambassador as it will shortly be necessary to proceed with tne construction of further Customs buildingsbuildings at Bassorah. Under the recent arrangement with the Germans, the line south of Bagdad would be worked by an international company and the construction of the port and terminus at Bassorah or at Rowait would be undertaken by this Company. bo far as regards Turkish Customs administration there would be serious objections to the port-terminus being fixed at Koweit. For in that case it would be necessary either to have a Turkish Customs at Koweit which would at once create difficulties of juris diction for Customs offences and irregularities; or it would be necessary to discharge again at the Bassorah Customs the goods which had been disembarked and put on rail at Koweit. Moreover if the port terminus were fixed at Koweit it would necessitate the dislocation of the existing commercial and banking agencies at Bassoran. •** Bo that Bassorah, if it possesses the required physical facilities, would be the more suitable terminus from an administrative and commercial point of view. Bassorah would also be the real centre of control for the through trails it trade to Persia, since the formalities of examination and transit charges would be carried out at Bassorah&gt; A hr V. I *v- .. Bassorah and the goods would go on via Bagdad to the Persian frontier franked by “through documents' issued by tne Bassorah Customs; and Bassorah would control also the traffic coming from Persia. I mention this point to show that the International Company would have the major control over the Persian transit trade. From my conversations with General of the Bagdad Railway) it is probable, 1 think, that the Company may decide to proceed with the Bagdad Hanekin section at an early date because the Persian transit trafiic will be at once a profit earning business It is possible therefore that an earlier solution of the Bassorall-Bagdad question may be considered desirable in view of approaching developments at Bagdad, 1 am looking, of course, only to tne practical aspects of this question as it comes before me in relation to Customs and commercial considerations.

[ ^ ■ In these circumstances, I think that our interests require^ that we should take some action to prevent any further arrangement being reached, without _ our knowledge and consent, between the German Company and the Porte. It will be within your recollection that in not very dissimilar circumstances the French Ambassador and I recommended (my telegram No. 29 et seq.) that, to prevent a surprise in the nature of the Potsdam agreement, we should be authorised to inform the Porte in firm language that our Governments desired to be consulted in regard to the negotiations then going on between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government. The suggestion was, however, overruled, partly on the ground that we had no legal standing to make such a representation, and partly because the form which M. Bompard and I had proposed that the communication might take would commit us too far in the question of the 4 per cent, increase of the customs duties. No communication was therefore made, and in the event the Germans *vere left free to obtain from the Porte not only such valuable concessions as the Osmanieh-Alexandretta branch and the port at the latter place, but also obtained stipulations which in effect secure to them the right to be consulted at every phase in the negotiations concerning the Bagdad-Gulf section; for, as you will remember, the International Company for its construction is to be formed in consultation with the Bagdad Railway Company, and when it has been formed, the Bagdad Railway Company have the right to obtain compensation for the loss it has suffered by the sacrifice of that section. Such stipulations obviously afford endless opportunities for obstruction and bargaining, so much so, that it is scarcely too much to say that the possibility of our coming to an agreement with the Turks depends primarily on German goodwill. It appears to me that unless we take some action now we may again find ourselves in the presence of another untoward fait accompli. But if, on the other hand, we avail ourselves of the present conjuncture, we may possibly regain some of the lost ground.

ASSIM BEY spoke to me yesterday about the counter-proposals regarding the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf questions which His Majesty’s Government had communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in a memorandum on the 29th July last. It would not appear that the Cabinet has as yet devoted much study to the question, for the memorandum has not yet been translated into Turkish, nor was Assim Bey in possession of the agreements and treaties respecting Koweit wdiich you had sent to Tewfik Pasha on the 2nd instant at his request. His Excellency said that he would like to talk over some of the points with me, but I suggested that, as Tewfik Pasha had authority to discuss the general question, it would be better that the Turkish Government should decide on the amendments to our proposals which they desired to suggest, and send them to his Excellency. He said, however, before doing so he would prefer to discuss some of the points academically, and proceeded to say that the Ottoman Government were very much opposed to the participation of Russia in the final portions of the railway, and would like to suggest that the Russian share should be divided up between the other four participants, thus giving to each 25 per cent., and he was of opinion that Turkey should also provide the president of the board. I observed that in the Bagdad Railway Turkey only had 10 per cent., and in view of the fact that the line was an Ottoman one and in Ottoman territory, there did not appear to be any necessity for her to require a share equal to the others. The Minister did not relish the reference to the Bagdad Railway, which he said was an unfortunate legacy of Sultan Abdul Hamid’s, and should not be taken as providing a precedent. I understand from another quarter that the suggestion that the Ottoman Government are likely to put forward is the elimination of Russia and the retention of 20 per cent, for Turkey, the remaining 80 per cent, to be divided between the three other Powers. His Excellency then observed that he did not quite see the object of any group of i capitalists having the majority vote on the board of such a railway. If the interested Powers were represented in any form it was clear that preferential rates could, not be established. Moreover, though he declared he had refrained from showing the German Ambassador the text of our proposals, he had asked him whether it would be possible to apply preferential rates, and whether this ever occurred on the Anatolian line. The Ambassador had obviously replied in the negative, and Assina Bey asked me whether I could produce specific cases of such preferential rates being given. I said that at present I could not, but there were undoubtedly ways in which advantages could be given which were not apparent, and that it was the general view that this did Assim Bey then went on to say that he did not understand why the idea of | Koweit as a terminus had been abandoned in favour of Bussorah. I said I imagined that as both places would require considerable works to transform them into a suitable harbour, and that Bussorah was already a town of. considerable importance with merchants and their warehouses established there, it would seem to have certain advanta ges over Koweit. Moreover, the long stretch of railway line ovei the desert would add somewhat to the cost of transport. To my. enquiry why the. Turkish Government appeared to prefer Koweit the Minister furnished no very definite repl} , but merely said that such a line as that to Koweit might be the beginning of a lailvay system which would be of use to Turkey in quelling disorders among the Arab tribes , | of those regions. . j i With the other proposals contained in the memorandum Assim Bey did not deal, but I understand that other members of the Cabinet considei that it would be very [2294 d—4] | Copy TO I NO A /V DEC 1911 SECRETARY’S N2 BOdifficult to obtain the acceptance of the Chamber of a measure for removing the existing veto on the borrowing’ powers of Egypt if presented by itseli, altnongn it might perhaps be possible to do so if it formed part of a general proposal for the settlement of all outstanding difficulties with Great Butain, a settlement which the piesent Cabinet express themselves as most anxious to bring about.

I have no information of Dr. Hogarth’s plans, but I heard privately a few days ago from Mr. T. E. Lawrence that some members of the party were likely to return to Jerablus .to resume operations this autumn. I have also heard vaguely that part of the land in the neighbourhood in question is British property. Some six weeks ago the German consul here, Herr Rossler, wrote to me privately protesting against a statement contained in an anonymous letter, which appeared in the “Times ” of the 9th August, to the effect that the Bagdad Railway was likely to demolish Charchemish and Tel Ahmar. I mentioned the matter to Meissner Pasha, and explained to him and to the consul that it was not possible for me to contradict the statement complained of or to communicate in any way with a newspaper. whether after all there was some truth in the rumour of which he had previously complained. M. Rossler replied that u he feared that part at least of the site was in danger of being interfered with, but that, so far as he was aware, the danger was not immediate, and that nothing was doing at the moment, as the plans were still under consideration in Germany.” He said he was convinced every care would be exercised not to infringe British rights, and he added a suggestion that it “ might be well for Dr. Hogarth (or whoever is concerned) to have a representative on the spot to protect any property from injury by natives or other untoward accident.” As stated above, I have no information as to what, if any, British interests are threatened, but it seems right to report the matter to your Excellency for communica tion, should you see fit, to Dr. Hogarth or others. The tour proposed in my No. 36 of the 24th instant, and on which I hope to start on the 30th {vide my telegram of the 27th), could be made to include a visit to Charchemish, the result of which 1 should hope to report to your Excellency in due course.

St. Petersburgh, August 23, 1911. tne honour to transmit to you herewith the text of the Russo-German agreement which was signed here on the 19th instant by the Acting Minister for .foreign Affairs, M. Aeratof, and the German Ambassador, Count Pourtales. le agreement as it now stands, in its final shape, differs in two important points rom t ie i e vised draft of which I forwarded you a summary in my despatch No. 201, becret, of the 12th of last month. By the addition of a few words to the 2nd article, Germany acquires the right to secure for herself the concession for the Tehran- v lain m line should neither Russia nor the financial syndicate to whom Russia may delegate her authority have commenced its construction within the prescribed term; while, by the suppression of the 2 nd paragraph of the 3 rd article, she evades taking any engagement m writing with respect to the construction of railwavs in the zone situated between the Bagdad line and the Russian and Persian frontiers^to the north of v amkm. As the linking up of the Bagdad Railway with the future Russian railway sjs em m Northern Persia is one of the main advantages which Germany hopes to derive from the agreement, it is not surprising that she should claim the reversion of the concession for the line by which this object is to be effected as a guarantee that the engagement taken by Russia on the subject will not remain a dead letter. On the o xer hand, the formal recognition of this claim by Russia may, as the “Novoe V remya points out, provide direct railway access for German goods to the Persian capital before the construction of the railway from the Russian frontier to Tehran has rendered a similar service to Russian trade. This is after all but a remote danger vv nch Russia should not find it difficult to avert, and her recognition of Germany’s light to this reversion is but the logical outcome of her consent to the linking up of the two railway systems. The omission of the clause in the 3rd article of the Russian draft, embodying the engagements which Germany was to take with regard to the construction of railways lunmng towards the Russian and Persian frontiers, is a much more important matter. In the conversations which I had with M. Sazonow last winter his Excellency repeatedly assured me that this was a point on which he would not yield, though it might be necessary to replace the clause in question by an exchange of secret notes. When therefore M. Aeratof told me in strict confidence that Germany had given a categorical assurance that she would not build any railways in the zone in question except such as she was entitled to build under the Bagdad Railway Concession, I reminded his Excellency of the language which M. Sazonow had formerly held to me, and expressed my surprise at his being contented with such a verbal assurance as well as at his admitting Germany’s right to construct short lines from the Diala towards the Persian frontier, and from Mosul to Arbil in addition to the line from some point on the main line to Diarbekr and Kharput. His Excellency replied that the two lines to which I had referred were unimportant branch lines of no strategic value, and that the Russian military authorities had waived the objections which had been originally raised to them. After the communi cation which they had made to the Porte in consequence of the publication of the draft agreement by the “ Evening Times,” the German Government had declared that it was impossible for them to give any engagement in writing with respect to the railways referred to in the 3rd Article. The insertion in the agreement of a special article respecting these railways was now altogether out of the question, while the secret was sure to leak out should recourse be had to an exchange of notes. The Russian Government had, therefore, accepted their verbal assurance. M. Neratof added that in doing this they had given a moral satisfaction to Germany’s amour-propre; that the construction of these railways w T as a matter which really only interested Russia ; and that the fact that an engagement had been consigned to writing was nowadays no guarantee that that engagement would be kept. ~ I remarked that his Excellency seemed to me to underestimate the importance of [2150 ee —3]1 the two branch lines to which I had drawn his attention, and that in any case I thought the Imperial Government had done more than sufficient to gratify Germany’s amour- propre by withdrawing their opposition to the whole Bagdad Railway scheme. M. Sazonow, I said, had always told me that whatever might be the interpretation given to the term “Bagdad Railway,” Russia would continue to co-operate with us just as'’ much after as before the signature of the agreement, and I should like to know whether his Excellency thought that it would still be possible for Russia to support us should difficulties arise with regard to the construction of the Gulf section. M. Neratof replied that Russia was under no obligation to facilitate the construction of the railway and that though she could not now have recourse to methods of direct obstruction, she could still co-operate with us in many ways and give us her indirect support. Though his Exceilency’s language was not very clear on this point, I gather that Russia would still be able to support any scheme which we might put forward with regard to the construction of the Gulf section, even though it did not meet with Germanv’^ approval. J The agreement, taken as a whole, must undoubtedly be regarded as a diplomatic success for Germany, and a retrospect of the various phases of the negotiations which have extended over the past nine months, does not tend to enhance the reputation of those who have conducted them on Russia’s behalf. The initial mistake was committed m i . onow . a } low ed himself to be entrapped, during his conversations with M. .derlen, mto verba l assurances of which he did not at the time realise the , ull significance.. This was due to his want of experience as a negotiator and to his ^ not weighing his words, rather than to the deliberate intention of throwing over the 1 ‘!° TTT h the ,h riple Enten - e &lt; Tlms ’ without an y P revious consultation flitli them he had pledged Russia to withdraw her opposition to the Bagdad Railway scheme, and though he subsequently endeavoured to restrict this engagement to the Romeh-Bagdad line, it was clear from the outset that Germany would hold him to the strict letter of his bond. His disregard of the understanding on which t£ three Governments had hitherto acted that no individual member oi the Triple Entente was to conclude an arrangement with Germany till the other two had obtained satisfaction for their respective claims, the vacillation and deplorable weakness which he displayed m the discussion over the Khanikin-Tehran line, and the uneasiness neither Ruslia V no, U Ge SSnranCeS had changed at Potsdam to the effect that dfrecffi • * G ® rma p; w °uld join any combination that could in any way be directed against the other, all combined to produce the impression that a serious blow had been struck at the stability of the Triple Entente.

N 6 ratof appears to to be somewhat disappointed by the absolute lack of any display of enthusiasm ihe “ Novoe Vremya ” breathes a sigh of relief on at last being delivered from the long strain of uncertainty, but otherwise has little of good or ill to say of the agreement It points out, however, that Germany’s declaration of political “ desinteressement ” is merely a repetition of her assurances with regard to Morocco, and wonders whether it will prove any more binding. The article compliments Russian diplomacy on its action in including in the zone m yv hich Gei man } 7 undertakes not to seek concessions, the small strip of neutral teiritoi } 7 along the Afghan frontier. It thinks this will tend to prevent complications since, theoretically at least, it will exclude German adventurers from that region. It has also a good word to say for Russia’s reserve as to her pecuniary and economic interests with regard to the Bagdad Railway, which will enable her to withhold her consent to any increase of the Turkish customs dues destined for the purposes of the railway. It criticises sharply the arrangement with regard to the Tehran-Khanikin line, and says that the onl\ chance left for Russia is to build the trans-Persian line to India as speedily as possible. Otherwise Russian traders in North Persia may as well shut up shop and return home, for their places will be taken by Germans. The “ Rech,” winch is always violently against the Government, takes the view that “ Russian trade in Persia has been sacrificed.” It cites Algeciras and Morocco as standing warnings, and concludes with the taunt that the date of the publication of the agreement was chosen in order to humiliate Russia in the eyes of her ally France, and to give Germany a breathing space in the ridiculous position in which she found herself in the Morocco negotiations. The £&lt; Bourse Gazette ” remarks sarcastically that in the agreement “ obligations are distributed evenly—at least, numerically speaking.” Russia has lost everything that she once possessed in Persia, but this is due rather to the lethargy and greed of Russian traders than to any fault of Germany, who has only acted in accordance with modern notions and left out of consideration everything but her own material interests. The paper does not think that Germany will follow her Moroccan tactics in the case of the I Russo-German agreement, as the maintenance of good relations wfith Russia is a political I dogma of the German Emperor. The “ Sviet,” the organ of the Nationalists and the Right, says that the balance of the agreement is much in favour of Germany, but nevertheless welcomes it as puttino- an end to the long period of suspense and in the hope that it may induce Russia to | wake up and build her own railway into Persia and so save it from the Germans. The “ Zemschina,” the organ of the Extreme Right, takes an unexpectedly anti- German view. It points out that, with any considerable development of German trade in Persia, Germany, whatever she may say now, is bound to have political interests in that country. The dangerous part of the agreement is that in which a limit is set for the construction of the Tehran Khanikin line. The article urges the immediate construction of railways in Persia, but warns its readers against being carried away by fantastic schemes, such as the line to India. What is required is a cheap type of line to carry goods at slow speed. Articles still continue to appear in many of the papers, but the above brief summaries of the published views of the chief papers of widely different political complexion are, I think, sufficient to show that the agreement has not been hailed with enthusiasm in any quarter.

Railway ^tion Un Benckendorff to - da y a short summary of the history of the Bagdad For some time M Isvolsky had been reluctant even to admit the principle of agreeing to the Bagdad Railway. In those days I had urged that, as the railway was sure to be made sooner or later, it was waste of time to discuss whether it should be be^greed to prmCip ^ e ’- and the lm P ort ant thing was to decide on what terms it should On the occasion of the German Emperor’s visit to Windsor a few years ago, the Germans had expressed themselves willing to discuss with us the question of the railway 1 had told Herr von Schoen that the discussion must be d quatre. Neither he nor the Emperor raised objections to that at the time, but subsequently the Germans had reiused to have a discussion a quatre. All this together with the Russian reluctance to accept the principle of the railway, had for some time suspended negotiations. Latterly the position had been that each of us might negotiate separately with the German Government, but that we should make no arrangement definite until a settlement was come to with all of us. I showed Count Benckendorff the conclusion of my letter of the 31st May, 1910, to Sir Henry Babington-Smith, who was then negotiating with Herr Gwmner on behalf of Sir Ernest Cassel. The last sentence was as follows. • • • • it would be well for you to make sure that any proposals put forward by Herr Gwinner have the approval of the German Government, and you must clearly understand that we can approve no agreement definitely without consulting the French and Russian Governments.” It appears now that, at Potsdam, M. Sazonow had agreed definitely to give Germany what she desired, namely, a junction at Khanikin. This was really all that Germany did wash to get from Russia, and the fact that Germany had obtained this fiom Russia definitely must to some extent weaken our position in dealing with Germany with regard to the Bagdad Railway. Count Benckendorff observed that this arrangement concerned only a branch of the Bagdad Railway, and did not really settle the question of the railway. Indeed, it might be said to be not the Bagdad Railway at all. More would be required from Russia before the railway was concluded ; for instance, her agreement to the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs dues. In regard to this, M. Sazonow was still quite unpledged. Further, though M. Sazonow had agreed to connection at Khanikin, he had not undertaken to make the Persian branch in any definite time. With regard to this last point, I observed that the negotiations between Russia and Germany were not yet concluded, and I doubted whether it was certain that the time for making the branch in Persia would remain indefinite, as Count Benckendorff said it was now. There was another point on which I wished to comment. I gathered from what 1 M. Sazonow had said to you that Germany might press for participation in the Tehran- Khanikin branch. It would be a very serious matter if Germany obtained any control of this branch. For, in times of Panislamic excitement, it might be used to mobilise German-trained Mussulman forces. Germany, who had no Mussulman subjects, w^as not embarrassed by Panislamism, but it might be very serious to Russia and England. It was therefore most important that Russia should retain absolute control. Further, I observed that, though M. Sazonow had stated originally that he would not discuss the neutral zone in Persia without first consulting us, he had brought part of it into his negotiations with Germany. I made no complaint as to what was done with regard to this part taken by itself ; but the Germans might now contend that as part of the neutral zone had been dealt with in the agreement this implied that Russia would not raise any question about the rest of the neutral zone, and this [1852 s—1]2 might be an embarrassment to Russia if we asked for her co-operation in matters concerning the neutral zone generally. I then said to Count Benckendorff that, though I made these criticisms on the negotiations at Potsdam, I wished it to be clearly understood that I did not regard them as affecting the general relations between Russia and England, which would ^ remain as far as I was concerned as cordial and intimate as ever. Nor did I wish Russia to back out of the arrangement which she had made; that would make her relations with Germany worse than before, and it would suit neither Russia nor us that she should be on bad terms with Germany. What I did wish was that Russia should be on her guard respecting the points to which I had called attention. I also told Count Benckendorff that we must now as opportunity occurred make the best terms we could with Germany or Turkey as to the section of the railway from Bagdad to the Gulf. It was most important that M. Sazonow should keep in reserve the question of the 4 per cent, increase of Turkish customs dues, so that we might both co-operate on this point. I was very glad to hear what Count Benckendorff had said on this point, and to learn from him how clear M. Sazonow’s view with regard to it was. I am, &amp;c. E.

A correspondent of the “ Novoe Vremya” he said, had called at the Ministry of foreign Affairs and had been told, in reply to the enquiries which he had made respecting the course of the negotiations with Germany, that a draft projet bad been sent to Berlin, and be had thereupon concocted a story about a fresh note. The draft agreement, of which he had given me the text, was, his Excellencv declared, the only answer which he was sending to the German note of 1907. M. Sazonow added that he had not wished to give undue importance to this mis statement by publishing an official dementi. In my telegram No. 7 of yesterday’s date I stated that it was M.

Corbett to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 16.) Munich, January 12 , 1911 (No. 3.) Sir, YOU have doubtless been informed from other sources of the commotion that has been occasioned in the G-erman press by the Chancellor’s speech in the Reichstag on the 10 th December with reference to the “Potsdam interview” and the comments thereon in the French and English newspapers. The subject was worn almost threadbare before I arrived in Munich, and I have therefore not thought it worth while hitherto to trouble you with any remarks upon it. To-day’s issue, however, of the “Miinchener Neueste Nachrichten ” contains a communi cation from its correspondent at Berlin which bears indication of being officially inspired, and may be fairly taken to indicate the view which the German Government would wish the public to take of the results of the now famous interview, especially as regards its effect on their relations with Great Britain. After some disobliging remarks respecting the attitude of the English, French, and Russian papers, and favourably comparing M. Sazonow’s character as a statesman with that of his predecessor M. Isvolsky, the writer of the article goes on to say that it is not to be wondered at that the standpoint of Russia in these negotiations has not been fully grasped by Russian diplomatists abroad or by the Chanceries of London and Paris. The latter have sought to prove that the results of the Potsdam interview were. exaggerated, and that both the Franco-Russian alliance and the Triple Entente remained unshaken. On the part of Germany these facts have never been contested, but it is indeed true that Germany and Russia have come to an understanding on various questions, with the firm determination on both sides that neither Power shall enter into any combination which is aimed against the other. If, however, out of a long list of questions the affairs of Persia and the Bagdad Railway contract have been singled out for special comment hy the foreign press it can only be because the idea that Russia should come to an independent understanding with Germany on these points is disliked in London, notwithstanding that not so long ago a united advance of the three Powers was planned. Russia is dealing at this juncture solely in the interest of her own commercial and political plans, and these interests happen to correspond exactly with those of Germany. But Germany is naturally also always ready to come to an understanding with England in regard to the Bagdad Railway, though obviously not on the basis of the pretensions categorically put forward by the “ Daily Telegraph.” To begin with, it may be observed that they would never be accepted by Turkey, for it must not be forgotten that the Bagdad Railway is a Turkish enterprise, carried out for the most part with German money, and that the Turkish Government, conscious of its own interests, will never hand over the important final section of the line to English control (“ Oberhoheit ”). Many other possibilities are, however, conceivable, and since the Governments of London and Berlin have agreed—according to the statement of the Imperial Chancellor on the 10 th December—forthwith to enter on an amicable discussion of their respective interests, it may be hoped that here too a way may be found to bring about a solution satisfactory to all parties.

This observation is due to the re-publication in a good many of ^the Constantinople papers of an article which appeared recently in the Daily News, suggesting that Great Britain was dissatisfied with the way in which Russia was fulfilling her engagements under the 1907 convention, and was beginning to repent of her efforts to maintain intimate relations. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1 . Extract from the “ Tanin ” of January 10, 1911. The Potsdam Meeting again. (Extract.) FURTHER information confirms the view we expressed yesterday that the idea that Russia was to build the Bagdad—Khanikin railway section was absurd, and that the Russo-German agreement merely treated of the junction to be effected between the Bagdad Railway and a line to be constructed by Russia in Persia. The matter now becomes clear and reasonable. Nevertheless, we could have wished that the German Government, for the sake of our amour-propre, had admitted to this purely economic discussion those entitled to admittance on purely economic grounds; that it had exchanged views, for instance, with the Ottoman Bagdad Company, or with the Russian, mixed or international company which proposes to build the Persian line. In that case the railway would have been separated from politics, and our confidence would have been increased. From the satisfactory information we have received, we can say that Germany was courteous enough to communicate to the Sublime Porte the gist of the economic discussion about the Khanikin line. Its omission to inform our Ambassador at Berlin at the same time is a detail, and we see no necessity to insist upon it. _ It is not only the Khanikin question which affects us. European statesmen must realise that all Persian affairs have a very keen interest for Turkey. Why is it that Russia, when she wants to get carte blanche, thinks it necessary to approach Germany, who is several thousand miles from Tabreez, while she does not exchange views with us, who have a common frontier with Persia for thousands of kilometres ? Even if we did not take so broad a view of the Persian question, why should it not be considered as important to discuss the Khanikin line with Ottoman diplomatists as with the Germans ? While not leaving the economic sphere, Germany is following an important policy in this matter. She is obtaining the consent of one of the Powers who for long have [1852 q —3]been opposed to tbe completion of the Bagdad Railway. Russia leaves the other opponent, England, practically alone in her obstruction, and she sacrifices this for a proposed’ Persian railway which may never come into being. She gives up present advantage for a future, imaginary profit 5 and that is why the English press is so angry and is accusing Russia of not playing the game. So far as the German point of view and the Bagdad Railway are concerned, there is no need for Turkey to excite herself about the Potsdam meeting. We repeat that the policy pursued with regard to Persia generally is for us a question of life and death. There is no country whose common frontier with Persia is as long as ours; there is no country with whose people we are so closely bound by ties of affection; therefore Turkey must have a voice in Persian affairs. Neglect touches the amour- propre. We do not think that the present strength of our country will allow us to be treated with this policy of neglect, and it is as necessary for the other party to the agreement to make explanations and communications to. the Sublime Porte as it was for Germany to make them. We are justified in expecting the communications which courtesy and friendship alike demand.— Ismail Hakki.: 8ro IThiB-Doca M is the Property of His B r ita nnic Majesty’s Gosernment.

Peter shirgh, January 10 , 1911. + r\ m ^ T ca on -^ lni ster for Foreign Affairs this afternoon his Excellency tlCA me ’n saying ‘ ie was very mucli upset, and that I could probably guess the reason. On my replying m the affirmative, M. Sazonow proceeded to say that he had a favour to ask of His Majesty s Government, namely, that they would endeavour to discover the source from which the “ Evening Times ” had obtained a copy of the agreement which was being negotiated between him and the German Ambassador. In order to meet the wishes of the German Government he had altered the text of the fourth article of the original draft, and the version of it that had been published by t e Evening Times was correct. According to its terms Germany was not to seek for concessions for railways, &amp;c., m the Russian zone without first coming to an under- s an mg with the Russian Government. This fact was known by no one outside the German and Russian Foreign Offices, not even by the Emperor of Russia himself, and he had therefore told Count Pourtales, who had just been to see him, that, as this was the case, the Evening Times” could only have obtained its information at Berlin or bt \ Refers burgh, and that it had certainly not done so at the latter capital. On my pointing out one or two discrepancies between the original draft and the published version, M. bazonow remarked that there were a few inaccuracies in some of the articles, but that, taken as a whole, the document published by the “ Evenino- Times ” was a literal translation of the original. ^ I said that I was sure that His Majesty's Government would be only too glad to render him every assistance in their power, but that I feared that they might have no means at their disposal for ascertaining the truth. It certainly seemed, after what he had told me, that somebody at the Berlin Foreign Office must have been guilty of a great indiscretion. . The German Government did occasionally use the English press for the purpose of imparting to the world information which it wished to make public whether that information were true or false. The report which had been communicated to his Excellency on his arrival at the Russian Embassy at Berlin that His Majesty’s Government were on the point of concluding an arrangement with the German Government on the subject of the Bagdad Railway had originated in an article in the “Daily Chronicle,” which had evidently been inspired in the Wilhelmstrasse. I should not, moreover, be surprised if the “ Daily News ” and the “ Nation ” had drawn their inspiration for their recent articles on the subject of the Triple Entente from the German Embassy in London. In any case, I could give him the positive assurance that the articles in question in no way represented the views of His Majesty’s Govern ment, that the papers themselves did not enjoy the reputation which appears to be attributed to them abroad, and that the Russian Government need not entertain the slightest doubt as to the loyal and friendly sentiments of His Majesty’s Government. M. Sazonow replied that he never doubted this for a moment, and that until to-day, when the “ Rech ” had alluded to them, not a single Russian newspaper of importance had paid any attention to the articles in question. On my asking later on in our conversation whether his Excellency could give any further information with regard to the course of the negotiations with me Count Pourtales, M. Sazonow replied that the German Government had, as he had anticipated, suggested several slight amendments in the text of the draft agreement. At first his Excellency did not seem inclined to inform me of their nature, but he subsequently told me that the German Government were anxious to alter the second article so as to bind Russia to commence the construction of the North Persian Railway as soon as the Sadijeh-Khanikin line had been completed. His Excellency explained to me at some length that Count Pourtales was insisting on obtaining such an assurance from Russia in order to satisfy German public opinion that the Imperial Government was doing all it could to secure an access for German trade to Persia from [1852 2 ]the south, seeing that the northern ronte was closed to it by the transit dues in the Caucasus. &gt; ^ I then enquired what truth there was in the reports which had appeared in the press that the two Governments were about to engage not to enter into any fresh combina, tions respecting Asiatic affairs that could in any way be directed against the other. I reminded his Excellency of the explanations which he had given me as to the meaning of the German Chancellor’s statement in the Reichstag with respect to the engagements taken at Potsdam as regarded such combinations in general (see my immediately J preceding despatch), and asked whether it was his intention to record these engage ments in the draft agreement. M. Sazonow replied by an emphatic negative, declaring that if the German Government proposed such a course to him he would certainly not consent to it. He still held to the explanations which he had given me on the occasion of the Chancellor’s speech. They represented what he held to be the true character of I these engagements, but there were certain details connected with the Potsdam visit which he could not confide to me at present. He would, however, communicate them to His Majesty’s Government when he went, as he hoped to be able to do later on, to London, and meanwhile he would ask me to reserve my report of what he had just told me for a despatch by messenger, as he did not trust cypher telegrams. I did not like to .press, his Excellency further, and had therefore to be content with this somewhat enigmatic explanation. , t i On taking leave of M. Sazonow I mentioned that I had to preside to-morrow at the annual dinner of the British community at St. Petersburgh, and that, in view of all that had been said in the press of late with regard to the Triple Entente, I proposed to say in the course of my speech that Anglo-Russian relations had never been more cordial than at the present moment, that the two nations were bound to each other by ties of sympathy and friendship, and that, now we had got to know and understand each other, I was convinced that we should always remain the best of friends. M. Sazonow replied that he entirely approved of my doing so, as he thought that such a statement might have a very good effect at the present moment. He would only ask me to add the word “interests” after “friendship and sympathy,” as our common interests were the most important bond of union between us. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. ^^•~J anuar y 12. I only noticed on looking at the map of Persia this afternoon that the line traced in the fourth article of the draft agreement, north of which the Germans, are not to ask.for concessions, runs for the last section considerably south of the Russian sphere of interest, and thus comprises a triangular block of the neutral zone. As M. Sazonow had never called my attention to this fact, I went to the Ministry ot foreign Affairs and asked him. to be good enough to explain the reason of including a reterence to the neutral zone in the draft agreement. His Excellency replied that he had done so. both in our interest and his own. The Russian Government were particularly anxious that the Germans should not obtain a concession in the portion of territory m question, and unless it was specifically mentioned in the agreement they would be tree to do so as in any other portion of the neutral zone. He did not imagine that we should raise any objection to it. I said that, though we had under stood that the neutral zone was not to be touched in the present negotiations, I did not ^ 0 na 7 + Se f any objection, but that, as the matter stood at present, I should have thp wTd a ; dliere ^ t0 tlle paginal text of article 4 and not to have introduced mAnt ” m 0U conill ^g previously to an understanding with the Russian Govern- f I p a ^onow replied that he had himself introduced these words into the cara^rrlSh th . e 1 ^ 11 ^ m § re , a fon : Count PourtaRs had objected to “ concessions de ormositinn h 1 p 1 '!? + em f adde ^ railways, &amp;c., and, in order to overcome his seutenop v u ^ n ^ 1 sto P after word “ telegraphes ” and begun a new ^ .

His Excellency further communicated to Mr. O’Beirne the assurances which the German Chancellor ia given him respecting Germany’s future policy in the Near East. At the same time M. Sazonow informed a correspondent of the “Novoe Vremva ” of the general tenoui of the agreement arrived at with regard to North Persia and the Bagdad Railway, and assured him that no attempt had been made at Potsdam to draw Russia away from her alliance with France and her cordial agreement with England. On my arnval at St. Petersburg!! a month later, M. Sazonow communicated to me the text of the draft agreement which he had just submitted to Count PourtaRs, according to the irs.t artlcwlllCdl Russia engages not to oppose the realisation of the Bagdad Railway. This engagement, his ExceRency subsequently explained, had only reference to the railway as far as Bagdad, and not to the whole railway system inclusive of the Gulf section and its other branches. ' ^ ’ ,i tlle - De 1 c . em ^ er \ drew his Excellency’s attention to the statement made by t e German Chancellor m the Reichstag a few days-previously that an engagement had been taken to the effect that neither of the two Governments would join a combination that might be in any way directed against the other. His Excellency t ereupon proceeded to explain that assurances had been exchanged between him and the German Chancellor to the effect that neither Government had the slightest desire to detach the other from the particular combination of Powers with which it was associated, and that neither of these respective combinations contained any point that was directed against the other. He further informed the French Ambassador on the same day that, though the text of the Chancellor’s statement had not been drafted in concert with him, it had been previously submitted to him by the German Ambassador and that he had raised no objections to its terms. On the 31st December the “Novoe Vremya ” announced that the Russian Government were about to send a note to the German Government in reply to the enquiries which the latter had addressed to them after the conclusion of the • n i l 0 f; i ? S 1 1 , ail T, Agree S, e ? t res P ec R n &amp; their future attitude towards German interests m the Middle East. This note, the “Novoe Vremya” declared, would state that the two Governments had agreed not to take any part in any new combination “with legard to Asiatic affairs which might be directed against the other. On my questioning M. Sazonow as to the truth of this statement, his Excellency explained ij -u• cor ^ es P°l 1 dent of the “ Novoe Vremya ” had misrepresented what had been told him at the Ministry of Foreign^ Affairs respecting the negotiations with Germany and that the draft agreement of which he had given me the text was the only answer which he proposed to return to the German note of 1907. His language to the French Ambassador, who addressed a similar enquiry to him a day or two later, was still more explicit, as his Excellency then declared th^t no other document, secret or public had eithei been prepared or was in course of preparation for communication to the [1852 ?~1] IT2 German Government. Finally, on the 7th of this month M. Sazonow informed a correspondent of the “ Novoe Yremya ” that, as regarded the Potsdam conversations, he could only repeat his former statement which had been published in the “ Novoe Yremya ” of the 9th November, and that any agreement which might be arrived at between the two Governments would be published in extenso. * I have &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith translation of an article which appeared in the “Novoe Vremya ” of the 18th (31st) December, stating that the Russian Government are about to address a note to the German Government on the subject of the relations of the two Powers in Asia. The German paper, the “ St. Petersburger Zeitung,” yesterday reproduced this article, hut none of the other Russian papers here have so far noticed it, a fact which may be due either to an official prohibition or to mistrust of its accuracy. I can find no record in the archives of the embassy of any mention by M. Isvolsky of the note of enquiry which the German Government are stated to have addressed to Russia on the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian agreement. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1 . Extract from the li Novoe Vremya’ &gt; of December 18 (31), 1910. IN the course of the next few weeks the Russian Government will give their answer to a note relating to Asiatic affairs which the German Government addressed to them shortly after the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian agreement. In this note Germany asked for information as to what attitude Russia would adopt, in view of the Anglo-Russian agreement, towards German interests in the Middle East. As the Anglp-Russian agreement did not directly affect Germany, this note has remained unanswered up to the present; now, however, when the views of the two Governments with regard to their respective interests in the Near and Middle East have been made clear at the Potsdam interview, the Russian Government are able to give a definite reply to the German note. This reply, we are informed, will not go beyond the statements made by M. Sazonow to a representative of the “Novoe Vremya,” and published in that paper on the 28th October ( 10 th November). We need not repeat the general substance here. Mutual explanations will be based on the idea that existing political combinations cannot be disturbed. Questions in the Near and Middle East in which Russian and German interests only are involved must be settled in such a way as to enable each Power to retain its position in the political group to which it at present belongs. Both parties, however, have agreed, with regard to Asiatic questions, not to take part in any new combination which might be directed against either of them. W e hope that both the German note of 1907 and the Russian reply will be immediately published in full. The Potsdam interview has given rise to so many honest delusions and to so many intentional misinterpretations that we need not insist on the necessity of this whole question being made absolutely clear.

Si r &gt; Constantinople, December 20, 1910. AS I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 918 of to-day’s date, Rifaat Pasha, at the end of our conversation of this morning, introduced the topic of the Bagdad, Railway. His Excellency said that, as he understood it, the desire of His Majesty s Government was to protect their commercial interests which they conceived to be threatened if the railway were entirely controlled by Germany, and that they therefore wished that the Bagdad “ to the terminus ” section should not be constructed and worked by Germans, and he suggested that adequate protection would be assured if that section were built and exploited by an Ottoman company or by the Ottoman Government, I pointed out to his Excellency that, as the two lines would be presum ably worked on the same system, the administrative board of the German line would naturally have a considerable voice in the joint management, whereas, unless the Turkish Government was ready to admit an adequate British element on the board of fP® Turkish line, we should have none at all j and I further asked his Excellency how the Germans would view the loss of what promised to be the most paying portion of their concession. From a financial point of view it would of course affect the Turkish Treasury more than the Germans, as the loss of the receipts on this section would tend to raise the amount for which Turkey is liable in respect of the kilometric guarantees. Rifaat Pasha said that the Germans were ready to make concessions—though he would not specify of what nature they would be—and went on to say that of course British trade would be guaranteed a fair share m the orders for materiel, &amp;c., for the Turkish line. He believed that if there was a sincere desire on both sides to come to an agree ment, a solution of the question satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government could be found, and suggested that, as the direct negotiations between the Germans and ourselves had failed, we might address ourselves to Turkey to act as intermediary. I told his Excellency that I was sure that His Majesty’s Government would welcome any suggestion that promised a satisfactory solution of this thorny question, and recom mended that, if the Sublime Porte had any definite proposal to make, they should instruct Tewfik Pasha to communicate it to you in London. Ycm will note that Rifaat Pasha’s suggestions do not go beyond those made to Sir G. Lowthsr by his Excellency and Hakki Pasha in May last (see Sir G. Lowther’s o. 276, Secret, of the old May), and that no reply has been given, as then*promised by his Highness, to your despatch No ; 107, Secret, of the 20th April, of which a copy was handed in by Sir Gerard on your instructions. Although Rifaat Pasha put marked emphasis on his wish to see a solution satisfactory to ourselves of this question, I am rather sceptical of any real sincerity on the part of the ^Ottoman Government. You will remember that prior to the approaches made to J\lr. Whittall by Dr. Gwmner a year ago, Hilmi Pasha, who was then Grand Vizior, hinted to me once 01 twice tlmt -Turkey conld or would promote an arrange* ment. Phe pouipailers between Sir E. Cassel and Dr. Gwmner, however, only resulted in inadmissible proposals being put forward by the Germans with the object of saddling us with the onus of refusing to continue the negotiations, which, if successful, carried with them an assent to the increase of the 4 per cent. Very possibly similar tactics are now being pursued, the difference being that the unaccept able basis for an understanding would be put forward by Turkey instead of Germany and that possibly more plausible terms will be submitted to us. At any rate, I feel convinced that the real object of the Turks is to endeavour to force our hand with regard to the 4 per cent. At the same time it is, I think, safe to affirm from these overtures that the Turks are more than a little uneasy both at the silent disapprobation we have shown of their general policy and also at the unexpected support which we gave to France in the question of the loan. The Grand Vizier was very careful in his declarations in 1 amament to disclaim any resentment over the latter question against the French or [1821 ee — 3 ]ourselves, and once or twice similar statements liave appeared in the committee press. This does not, in my opinion, in any way imply a permanent alteration in the committee’s policy, as expounded in the secret resolutions of the congress at Salonica last month, hut merely that Djavid Bey recognises that the financial requirements of the country make it temporarily necessary to show a conciliatory attitude towards us in the hope of opening the London market for a future loan, and also that the committee art ' aware that a considerable section of its party in the Chamber and the great mass of public opinion views with mistrust the departure from the traditional policy of friendship towards England and France. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING.U.'&amp;lK,'*' From Viceroy, 18f/?, January 1911. Foreign Secret, Your telegram of 14tli. Trans-Persian railway. I venture to think that the extension of the Russian zone for the purposes of the Russo-German agreement is an advantage rather than the reverse. It was previously possible for Germany to build railway to any point on the Afghan frontier between Gazik and the intersection of Russian and Afghan frontiers. It is now only possible to do so after an understanding with Russia. In view of the terms of the preamble of agreement concerning Persia, in which our interest in the provinces adjoining frontier of Afghanistan was expressly stated, we have right to demand of Russia that she shall not agree to support intervention of any third Power in regions where our interest s, are distinctly stated in Anglo-Russian Convention, otherwise object of Con vention which was to prevent all cause of misunderstanding between Great Britain and Russia will be frustrated. That Germany has the right to seek concessions in the rest of neutral zone is an indisputable fact. Our oniy means of preventing our political and strategic interests in Southern Persia from being disadvantageous^ affected is to remind German Government of their assurances to His Majesty’s Government, and to repeat when occasion arises to the Persian Government our warning against grant of any conces sions that may prejudice our political and strategic interests in Persia, and, if necessary, to threaten that we will take steps to safeguard our own interests. _n^r 0 r~\ nisj CONFIDENTIAL.

AT the new year’s reception this morning I told the Emperor how greatly pleased the King had been with the gracious reception His Majesty had accorded me and with the very friendly assurances he had given. His Majesty replied that this was but natural, as we could always count upon friendliness of his sentiments. On my referring to polemical discussions carried on m the press respecting the Russo-German nego tiations, His Majesty said that revelations of the “ Evening Times ” had come as a bomb-shell, and that, after the thorough manner m which matter had been|mvestigated at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here, it was clearly established that the information could not have been obtained at St. Petersburgh. I said that secret had certainly not leaked out m London, as we were not acquainted with the revised text of the fourth article, and it therefore looked as if an indiscretion had been committed at Berlin. His Majesty silently acquiesced, and was then pleased to say that he had seen a report of my speech at the English Club, and was very glad that I had spoken as I did. I then ventured to speak in much the same sense as I had done at my audience. His Majesty’s Government, I said, were only too glad that Russo-German relations should be placed on a more friendly footing, but we trusted that no engagement might be contracted which would fetter Russia’s liberty of co-operating with us as freely as in the past, and that her promise not to oppose Bagdad Railway would not prevent her working together with us with regard to railway between Bagdad and the Gulf. The Emperor said that it would make no difference whatever, and that engagement to which I had referred had only reference to railway as far as Bagdad. From the frank and cordial manner in which the Emperor spoke to me I think that there can be no doubt that, in spite of the unfortunate assurances which Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs has given so light-heartedly, His Majesty has no intention at present of giving a new direction to his foreign policy. The Emperor told the French Ambassador that he had read the French Minister for Foreign Affairs’ speech with great satisfaction ; that it gave a clear and accurate expose oi the political situation; and that he concurred in all that his Excellency had said.CONFIDENTIAL U14JAN1911 0 I % Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 13, 3*15 p.m.) Pera, January 13, 1911, 1 p.m. (No. 9.)

Buchanan to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received January 2, 1911.) (No. 497. Secret.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, December 26, 1910. IN the course of a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon, I reverted to the subject of the draft agreement which he had submitted .to the German Government respecting Persia and the Bagdad Railway. I said that his Excellency would no doubt already have learnt from Count Benckendorff that its first article, if read by anyone unacquainted with the explanations which he had given, could only in your opinion imply that Russia was consenting to abandon all opposition to the realisation of the whole Bagdad Railway project, and that the limited construction which he was putting on it gave a quite new interpretation to the recognised meaning of the term “Bagdad Railway.” If, moreover, his Excellency’s view &amp; as to the meaning of article 1 was correct, it was difficult to see what advantages Germany would gain under the draft agreement in return for the concessions which she was making to Russia in North Persia. I also repeated to M. Sazonow what you, Sir, had told Count Benckendorff—that, should his Majesty’s Government ever find that a satisfactory arrangement could be made with Germany respecting the Gulf section, they would not confirm it until Russia and France had been able to make such arrangements with Germany as suited their respective interests, and that, although negotiations might proceed separately, no settlement ought to be arrived at until all three Governments were satisfied. M. Sazonow did not take up this last point except to explain that he had been obliged to telegraph to Count Benckendorff, instructing him to correct the statement which his Excellency had made to you as to the agreement respecting the linking up of the two railway systems being contingent on the conclusion by His Majesty’s Government of a satisfactory understanding with Germany respecting the Gulf section. As regarded, however, the wording of. article 1, he assured me that it had never struck him that it could bear any other interpretation than that which he had intended to give to it, and that, had he not thought so, he would certainly have worded it differently. On my enquiring whether he proposed to obtain from the German Government an assurance in writing that the right to construct the line from Sadijeh to Khanikin should be ceded to Russia in the event of Great Britain obtaining the control over, the Gulf section, M. Sazonow said that he had no such intention. During the discussions which had taken place at Berlin the two questions of the Bagdad Railway—by which he meant the railway up to Bagdad—and the whole Bagdad railway, system had been treated separately. Russia had engaged not to oppose the realisation of the railway up to Bagdad, and had consented to the finking up of this railway with the future North Persian railway system by a line running from Sadijeh to Khanikin, because she was powerless to prevent the realisation of either of these two schemes. Before the Potsdam interview the relations between the two Govern ments had been very strained, and he had lived in daily dread of receiving the news that Germany had obtained from the Persian Government the concession for the Khanikin-Tehran line. The counter-concessions which he had extracted from Germany were of the greatest importance to Russia ; while the engagements which the latter had taken would be a moral satisfaction to German public opinion, and would give German trade an access to the Persian markets. Great Britain had nothing whatever to fear from the terms of the first article. The position of the Russian Government with regard to any lines running from Bagdad either to the Gulf or to the Mediterranean would be exactly the same as it was before that article had been drafted. As he had told me already, he did not for one moment believe that Germany could ever construct a line to the Gulf without our assistance ; but if the worst came to the^ worst, and Russia had to give us her support, the only result would be a possible “row” between the Russian and the German Governments. I observed that even in my own small experience I had seen cases where considerable complications had ensued in consequence of a treaty being so looselyworded that either party to it could interpret it m the sense most favourable to its interests. I understood from what he had told me at our first interview that 3 expected that the German Government would not accept the draft agreement as it stood If therefore, they had the right to introduce amendments into it, I could not see why the Russian Government was debarred trom altering the text of the first article so as to leave no doubt as to its meaning, more especially as his Excellency ha., already clearly explained to them what was meant by the term Bagdad Railway. M. Sazonow first contended that it was now too late to do this, but on my pressing the point later on in our conversation his Excellency promised to see whether he could get the words “ jusqu’a ” inserted before Bagdad. He did not, however, take any positive engagement to this effect, and the fulfilment of his promise will no doubt depend on the reception which may be accorded to such a suggestion at Berlin. His Excellency has so far received no communication from the German Government on the subject of the draft agreement. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W.

The four articles of the original draft had been altered at the request of the German Government. According to the revised text Germany was not to seek for concessions in the Russian zone without first coming to an understanding with the Russian Government, and he had told the German Ambassador that as this fact was known by nobody outside the two Foreign Offices, not even by the Emperor of. Russia, the text must have been communicated to the newspaper correspondent either at Berlin or St. Petersburgh, and this had certainly not been done at the latter capital. There were, he said, a few inaccuracies in one or two of the other articles, but otherwise the text published was almost an exact translation of the original. I said that I was sure that His Majesty’s Government would be only too happy to help him to discover the truth, but that I feared they had no means at their disposal for doing so. His Excellency suggested that they might employ the services of a detective. J* [151—36][This Bocmnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government! EASTERN DEPARTMENT. t SECRET SERIES.

ON my entering M. Sazonow’s reception-room this afternoon M. Timiriazeff was just leaving it, and his Excellency informed me that he had come to report to him the results of his visit to London with regard to the trans-Persian railway scheme. M. Timiriazeff had, M. Sazonow said, been very well satisfied with the conversa tions which he had with various leading politicians and financiers. He had gathered, however, that it was desired in England that the company should be a purely Anglo- Russian one, and that the projected railway should not pass through Tehran, for fear lest the Bagdad Railway should eventually be linked with it when the Sadijeh- Khanikin and the Khanikin-Tehran lines had been built. As regarded the first of these two points, M. Sazonow remarked that it would, he thought, be almost impossible to prevent the participation of the French in the enterprise, and that it would be very difficult to obtain the necessary concession from the Persian Government were a proposal to be put forward that the British and Russian Governments should have the control of the railway in their respective spheres of influence in Persia. The Persian Government would at once suspect that the two Governments were planning a sort of condominium in Persia, and would cite the case of Manchuria, where the railway was controlled by Russia in the north and by Japan in the south. I told his Excellency that I had no official information as to the views of His Majesty’s Government wdth regard to the details of the scheme, but I repeated to him the language which you had held to Count Benckendorff, as reported in your despatch No. 314, Secret, of the 15th instant, respecting its strategical bearings and the possible danger of its serving as a means of transport for Turkish troops to the Indian frontier. M. Sazonow replied that he quite understood the reasons which might lead public opinion in India to view the project with an unfavourable eye, but that he could not see that there w r ere any possible grounds for fearing the second contingency to which you had drawn attention. Even when the Sadijeh-Khanikin and the Khanikin-Tehran railways were built, it would be impossible for the Turks to use the latter line for such a purpose, as it would be virtually under Russian control, while an international railway like the trans-Persian one would be equally closed to them. If, however, His Majesty’s Government desired, for either strategical or economical reasons, that the railway should not touch Tehran, it would be always possible to arrange that it should run to the north of that town, though this, again, might lead to difficulties with the Persian Government, who would naturally wish that the railway should pass through the capital. But in whatever way this question might be settled, it was, in his opinion, essential that the railway should be built with the least possible delay, as, were it once in working order, it was quite possible that the Sadijeh-Khanikin-Tehran lines might never be constructed. On my observing that there seemed to be considerable opposition to the project in certain quarters in Russia, M. Sazonow said that this was quite true. The Moscow merchants wished to keep the trade in North Persia in their own hands, and were afraid of German competition, but, owing to the dues imposed on goods passing in transit through the Caucasus, German trade with Persia by this route would always be heavily handicapped. Germany had made repeated representations on the subject of these dues, but the Russian Government had no intention of making any concessions with regard to them. They would therefore continue to be enforced on all goods destined for the Persian market, but not on those passing in transit to India. His Excellency admitted, however, that owing to the existence of these dues the Germans would naturally endeavour to introduce their goods into Persia by way of Bagdad; •and this fact somewhat weakens his argument that, were the trans-Persian railway to [1852 6—3]! be constructed without delay, the Germans might have to renounce the idea of linking the Bagdad Railway with the North Persian railway system. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. P.S.—The Minister of Finance, whom I have seen since writing the above, tells me that the trans-Persian railway scheme is to come before the Council of Ministers this week. His Excellency expressed himself strongly in its favour. He spoke slightingly of the opposition raised by the Moscow merchants, and said that then- fears that the proposed railway would threaten their hold on the Persian market bv facilitating the importation of German goods were groundless. His Excellency added that the real danger of German competition in Persia lay on the side of the Bagdad Railway. G. W. B.[This Docament is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.!

TTT , . 1 1 Petersburg^ December 26, 1910. 1 HAVIj m another despatch recorded the bitter language used by the “ Novoe Vremya ” in speaking of Austria in connection with the Wassitch trial, which has iust been concluded at Belgrade. From the language held to me by the Emperor and from the tone of the Russian press it would appear that, while His Majesty and the Russian Government have forgotten and forgiven the humiliation which Germany inflicted on them during the Balkan crisis of 1908, their feeling ot rancour against Austria, and more especially against Count Aehrenthal, shows no sign of abatement. M. Isvolsky has doubtless handed down to his successor a political legacy of profound distrust and dislike of that statesman, and this fact, coupled with the knowledge that the Emperor shares this personal resentment, is likely to prevent M. Sazonow attempting to bring about an Austro-Russian rapprochement so long as the foreign policy of the Dual Monarchy is controlled by Count Aehrenthal. Were the latter to disappear from the scene the case might be different, as his retirement would give satisfaction to Russia’s wounded vanity. Germany, on the other hand, has also reasons of her own for wishing to see a more pliable and subservient Minister installed at the Ballplatz, and from the Chancellor’s recent declarations on German policy in the Near East and from the violent articles published in the Russian press, it would almost seem that the two Governments had agreed to open a campaign against his Excellency for the purpose of discrediting him and encompassing his fall. Should these efforts be crowned with ) success, the way would be prepared for supplementing the Russo-German agreement respecting Persia and the Bagdad Railway by some kind of an understanding between Austria and Russia with regard to the Balkans. Were this latter to take the j form which M. Isvolsky desired to give to the abortive conversations which took place between St. Petersburgh and Vienna last spring, and w T ere the other Powers consequently to be invited to subscribe to its provisions, it might serve as a useful instrument for the maintenance of peace in the Near East. Were it, however, as is not impossible, to be in the nature of a secret agreement between the two Cabinets, of which Germany, as Austria’s ally, would alone have cognisance, it might seriously affect the value of the Triple Entente as a counterpoise to Austro-German ascendency in Europe. At the present moment both the Emperor and his Government are, I believe, sincerely anxious to adhere loyally to their alliance with France and to their under standing with England; but the course which the present negotiations with Germany have taken leads me to fear that when it is a question of securing satisfaction for some particular or immediate interest Russia may drift dangerously far into German waters. H Nor must it be forgotten that the reactionary party in Russia inclines much more towards Germany than towards England, while there are not wanting those who are in favour of being on the side of the big battalions. M. Sazonow’s desire to prevent Germany poaching in the Russian preserves ; in North Persia accounts for the haste with which he has made proposals respecting Persia and the Bagdad Railway without consulting our views or wishes. He was, it is true, not bound to do so by the terms of the Anglo-Russian agreement, but he has none the less laid himself open to the reproach of not having observed the spirit of the tacit understanding, according to which no arrangement was to be concluded with Germany respecting the Bagdad Railway by any one of the parties to the Triple Entente until the other two had also come to terms with her. The temptation to secure favourable conditions with regard to North Persia was too strong for him, and he either drafted or accepted the text of the 1st article of the draft agreement without reflecting on the difficulties which it might occasion in the future. As an instance of his rather careless habit of doing business I may mention that, though I informed him the day [1852 5-4]before my audience with the Emperor of the general purport of the language which I proposed to hold to His Majesty, he never told me till afterwards that he had not yet submitted the draft agreement to His Majesty. I was naturally, therefore, under thp impression that such an important State document could not have been submitted to th German Government without the Emperor’s express sanction. , Fortunately, however, I did not make any reference to it in the course of my conversation with His Majesty • but had I unwittingly done so it would have been interestiog to have heard what the Emperor would have said on learning that I was better acquainted than himself with the details of the secret negotiations which his Foreign Minister was conducting with the German Government.

Constantinople, relating to Sir William Willcocks’ project for a Baghdad-Basrah Railway, I have the honour to submit a memorandum by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant in the Baghdad Residency. The memorandum is an attempt to form an estimate of the volume of goods and passenger traffic between Baghdad and Basrah at the present time. 2. Mr. Gaskin, it will be seen, arrives at the following annual totals of goods and passengers:— Tons. Foreign imports, Basrah to Baghdad ..... 33 098 Foreign exports, Baghdad to Basrah . . . . . 27,052 Local trade between Baghdad and Basrah .... 20,000 Total . 80,150 Persons. Passengers between Baghdad and Basrah in either direction . 27,000 These figures may seem unpromising; but it must be remembered that in Mr. Gaskin’s statements, neceesarily, no account is taken of (a) the traffic with and between points on the line intermediate to the termini; (S) the traffic of places off the line which could he reached by light feeder branches; (c) the general impulse to movement which would be given by the existence of a railway ; and (d) the great increase of agricultural production, and concurrently of trade, which would result from the irrigation of this country. I I venture to think that the first three of the omitted considerations, (a), (&amp;) and (c) are negligeable except so far as included in the fourth, and that it is on the fourth, (d), that the whole question of railway construction in ’Iraq probably depends. I shall therefore endeavour to obtain from Sir William Willcocks an estimate of the amount of exportable produce which the country upon his proposed line of railway would, in his opinion, he capable of raising, supposing his irrigation projects to he carried out in their entirety. 3. In the meanwhile, I respectfully suggest the Indian railway rates might be applied to Mr. Gaskin’s estimates upon an assumed distance by rail between Baghdad and Basrah of 325 miles. The result would represent the initial minimum receipts of a Baghdad-Basrah railway if steam navigation were suspended; and I would be glad if it could be communicated to me at some early date. I would also ask to be supplied with an Indian railway goods. and passenger tariff, preferably that in force on the Lahore-Karachi line, with a view to ascertaining whether carriage by rail between Baghdad and Basrah might really be cheaper, as well as more expeditious than carriage by steamer. I.

Next to Sir William Willcocks’ schemes for the _ irrigation of Mesopotamia generally, this project is in my opinion the most important which has claimed notice since my appointment to Baghdad a year ago; and I trust that Your Excellency may see fit to submit the papers, though containing little more than a rather indefinite suggestion, to His Majesty’s Government. (1) Letter from Sir William Willcocks to my address, dated the 7th October 1910. (2) Letter from Sir William Willcocks to my address, dated the 15th October 1910, with enclosure, dated the 9th October 1910. (3) Map (blue print) referred to in the first letter. Sir WiUiam Willcocks was formerly, as is known, the strong partisan of a direct railway across the desert from Baghdad to the Mediterranean; but he has lately been impressed by some of the disadvantages inseparable from such a scheme; and he now proposes, as an alternative to his original recommenda tions, a line to connect Baghdad with the Persian Gulf. It is understood that the Turkish authorities hold that the security of a line running largely through unsettled Arab country might not be altogether easy to guarantee; there might also he trouble as to the terms on which a line towards the Mediterranean could be connected with the Syrian railway system; and, at the other end, the necessity of crossing the German Baghdad Railway, in order to arrive at Baghdad, might give rise to complications. But it appears that the change in Sir William Willcocks’ views is due principally to an observation by Sir E. Cassel, who pointed out to him that the distance to the sea, for purposes of railway construction, should he measured not from Baghdad but from the centre of gravity of the large tract in ’Iraq, which steps are now being taken to irrigate. This centre, it is apparently admitted by Sir William WHllcocks, will lie somewhere between Baghdad and Basrah, and will therefore be very much nearer to the Persian Gulf than to the Mediterranean. Erom conversations with Sir William W r illcocks I have gathered that what he contemplates is a self-supporting line, such as could be constructed without any financial guarantee on the part of the Turkish Government, and that he believes such a line to be a possibility. Whether Sir William Whllcocks is or is not right in this last opinion is a question which can only be decided on statistics and estimates (actual and prospective) of production, exportation, and importation. I am endeavouring to arrange for the collection of these, but it seems inadvisable to delay the present despatch until they have been prepared, especially as the matter of the railway has other polit’cal bearings which His Majesty’s Government will wish time to consider.It may be observed bere, however, that railway transport between Baghdad and Basrah would certainly be more rapid and reliable than that by river- steamer which at present exists ; and Sir William Willcocks, in conversation, has adduced figures tending to show that it might also be cheaper. The time taken by travellers between the two places would be reduced from 4 or 5 days to something under 24 hours ; and in the case of goods, also, traffic would no doubt be greatly accelerated; while accumulations of merchandise at either end of the line, due to the absence of sufficient carrying power when business is brisk, could probably be avoided with a railway. The navigation of £ ^ e . i qi n yt 7 the Tigris during some months of the * See Summary of Events for September 1910, XI-7. . D -,.^ ix i j • year is * already diflicult and uncertain, owing to physical obstacles ; and it is manifest that, if the rivers should he tapped above Baghdad for purposes of irrigation— an operation without which the country cannot attain to its maximum agricultural development—it would become unnavigable below Baghdad, at least for part of the year, by vessels of the size and build owned by the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the (Turkish) Idarah Nahriyah. The freights charged by the river steamers are, I believe, heavy ; but, until I have had an oppor tunity of comparing them with the freights for goods carried on Indian railways, I cannot express any opinion as to the probability of railway rates being lower. If the construction of a non-guaranteed Baghdad-Basrah railway is shown to be economically feasible, further questions will at once arise which His Majesty’s Government may, perhaps, desire to examine in advance. The two principal of these appear to be the following :— ( 1 ) Whether the new project would in any way conflict with Turkey’s international obligations ? (2) Whether, and to what extent, and by what means—supposing the enterprise to be economically sound and politically practicable —the participation of British subjects in it can be arranged ? Both of these questions evidently lie beyond the scope of a local officer such as myself. I may remark that the sentiments of the Baghdad Local Government, if they were correctly reflected in language which Eram Bey, their Political Secretary, lately held in conversation with me, appear to be extremely favourable to Sir William Willcocks’ new railway project ; and I even gather that the project itself has become a sort of bond of union between its author and the Wilayat, so much so that it may possibly have the effect of modifying a tendency to disagreement between them upon other subjects. Eram Bey told me that the short land route from Lower Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf appeared to him a more natural outlet for the products of Mesopotamia, notwithstanding the great length of the sea-voyage from Basrah to Europe, than the long land route to the Mediterranean via Syria. He also expressed great joy at the prospect, which seemed to him realisable, of Turkey’s being able to establish a valuable line of railway communication in Mesopotamia free from the unfavourable conditions contained in the German Baghdad Bailway concession. Sir W illiam W illcocks’ observation, at the end of his letter to the Wall, about the transference of the Persian transit tr;ide from Baghdad to t SeeSjummary of Events for September 1910, Muliammerah, is in my Opinion Well f founded ; and this aspect of the matter is of supreme importance to the Turkish Government. The substitution of railway for river-steamer carriage would necessarily bring to an end the shipping business which the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have conducted here, with great efficiency and succei s, for many years ; but I do not anticipate that the British Government, though they may regard the Company as entitled to compensation on account of the driving-up of the Tigris by the act of the Turkish Government and the consequent virtual invalidation of the Company’s concession from the Porte, will consider that any protest lies against the construction of an internal Bail way m Turkey on the ground of its competition with a previously established British concern. In case of compensation being granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam ayigation Company for the destruction of the Tigris as a navigable river, it might take the form, in whole or in part, of an interest conferred on them gratis in the new Bailway Company.3 Dated Baghdad, the 7th October 1910. From —Sir William Willcocks, To— J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. I enclose two copies of a plan showing all possible railways between Baghdad and Basrah. As far as I can see I shall be forced to make an escape for the Tigris down the depression which runs from the extreme end of Ctesiphon curve down to Nasria. Once the escape is made the Tigris in the Amara reach will be capable of great development, and I must carefully examine the tract which hitherto I have everlooked as it is a kind of washpot for the Tigris. The first result will be that the line of railway down the left bank of the Tigris from Baghdad to Kut and thence to Amara, Gurna and Basrah will become an excellent line of railway, the shortest and the best between Baghdad and Basrah. The navigation of the Tigris downstream of Amara hangs on such a fine thread and may any day come to a dead stop, that we should be ready with an alternative Tigris railway. Baghdad without the Tigris navigation will be an unimportant town unless a railway quickly takes its place. Mind the Euphrates has completely changed its course in two different places, and so can the Tigris. It has done so in the past. Dated Baghdad, the 15th October 1910.

I have reliable information that the Minister of Finance has tried hard to get the continuation beyond. Missis altered so as to pass by Alexandretta and Aleppo, but that the military authorities have remained obsessed with the idea that to construct the line via Alexandretta would expose it to attack by Great Britain, in the event of our being at war with Turkey. It has therefore been decided to take the line from Missis direct to Aleppo, probably through Killis. I n VP rvO ’ CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Bawlins to Consul-General Eyres.

On my repeating what I had said to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs of the value attached by the King and His Majesty’s Government to the maintenance of the most intimate understanding with Russia, the Emperor said that he desired this with all his heart, and that he would always be ready to help us in any way in his power. The understanding had already borne excellent fruit, and he thought it most important that Great Britain and Russia, as two great Asiatic Powers, should follow the same broad lines of policy in their respective possessions, which might in no distant future be menaced by dangers of a pan-Islamic movement. Speaking of the Potsdam visit, His Imperial Majesty said that after his long stay in Germany he could not do otherwise than visit the Emperor, but that he had been surprised and pleased at the warmth of his reception and at the assurances which he had received of the German Government’s desire to maintain the friendliest relations with Russia. This His Majesty regarded as a very satisfactory result of his visit. I replied that a relaxation of the tension which had at one time existed between Germany and Russia would be equally welcome to His Majesty’s Government, as it would certainly make for peace if both England and Russia could live on friendly terms with Germany. They would not, however, as His Majesty was aware, conclude any arrangements with that Empire without first consulting him. They equally trusted that the Imperial Government would not commit themselves to any eno-ao- e - ment with Germany which would preclude them from co-operating with and supporting us in the future, more especially as regards the Bagdad Railway. The Emperor replied that he would certainly never do so, and that he would conclude no agreement with Germany respecting that railway without first submitting it to us and enquiring our views. As the Emperor made no allusion to the draft agree ment communicated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I did not venture to refer to it,^but His Majesty’s assurances went considerably farther than those given me by his Excellency, vRo said that as the notes of article 1 had been sent to Berlin he could not now r alter it. Refeiiing to what the German Chancellor had told the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs respecting Germany’s policy in the Near East, the Emperor spoke very bitterly of Baron von Aehrenthal, in whom, he said, he could not place the slightest confidence. &amp;CONFIDENTIAL. /;x U 29 DEG 1910 Sir G.

St Petersburgh, December 15, 1910. , S'honour of being received to-day in audience by the Emperor of Russia at the i alace of Tsarskoe Selo, and of delivering to His Majesty my letter of credence, as well as the personal letter with which the King had graciously charged me. In domg so, I repeated to His Majesty the assurances which I had already given to M. feazonow as to the earnest desire of the King and of His Majesty’s Government to maintain the most intimate understanding with Russia. The Emperor, in reply, said that he reciprocated this wish with all his heart, and that he would always render His Majesty’s Government every assistance that it was possible for him to give. The Anglo-Rnssian understanding had, His Majesty continued, already borne excellent fruit ; and he thought that it was most important that Great Britain and Russia, as two great Asiatic Powers, should follow the same broad lines of policy in their respective possessions in Asia. Great Britain had of late experienced considerable troubles in India, and Russia was likely soon to be confronted with similar difficulties in lurkestan. An active propaganda was being carried on theie by the Mullahs, and His Majesty feared that we were both threatened with a serious Panislamistic movement. I observed that it was rather with the Hindus than with the Mahommedans that our troubles in India had originated, but that many persons attributed to the Young Turks the desire to encourage such a movement as that of which His Majesty had spoken. I ventured, however, to think that, apart from what it might accomplish in Asia, the Anglo-Russian understanding was a very valuable instrument for maintaining peace as well as the balance of power in Europe. The Emperor smiled, and said that the latter was a very important matter. . Ma jesty then proceeded to speak of his recent visit to Potsdam. It would, he said, have been impossible for him, after the long stay which he had made in Germany, to have, avoided visiting the Emperor William, and he had also thought that such a visit might do good. He had, however, been very agreeably surprised and pleased with the warmth of the rception which had been accorded him, and by the evidently sincere desire of the German Government to cultivate good and friendly relations with Russia. This result of his visit had given him considerable satisfaction. I ventured to reply that, the relaxation of the tension which had at one time existed between Germany and Russia could not but be welcome to His Majesty’s Government. They desired nothing better than that both Russia and Great Britain should live on friendly terms with Germany, as this must undoubtedly promote the cause of a European peace. They would not, however, in their desire to establish good relations with Germany, come to any understanding with that Empire without first consulting with His Majesty and the Imperial Government. On the other hand, they trusted that the Imperial Government would not commit itself to any definite engagement vis d-vis of Germany which could in any way preclude it from co-operating with them or from supporting them in questions in which they, were interested, more especially in that of the Bagdad Railway, without previously taking them into its confidence. The Emperor replied that the assurances which he had received last year on this subject had given him great satisfaction, and that he would certainly act in the same frank and loyal manner. Pie would not, His Majesty assured me, contract any engagement respecting the Bagdad Railway without first submitting it to His Majesty’s Government and consulting their views. As the Emperor made no allusion whatever to the draft agreement which had been communicated to us by M. Sazonow, I did not, on my part, venture to refer to it. I would, however., call attention to the fact that the Emperor’s assurances go much further than those given me by M. Sazonow, as, while His Majesty distinctly said that he would consult our views, his Excellency, on my taking exception to the wording of article 1, declared that it was too late to alter it, as it had already been communicated to the German Government. It is difficult to explain the discrepancy between the two statements, except on the supposition that the Emperor [1821 t —1] F [45699] (No. 488. Sir,Las not followed closely the details of the negotiations which have been taking place between the Foreign Minister and the German Ambassador. During the course of our further conversation the Emperor alluded, with evideni satisfaction, to what the Chancellor had told M. Sazonow respecting Germany’s policy in the Near East. As His Majesty seemed rather at a loss-to account for the reasons which had induced the Chancellor to give such, far-reaching assurances, I observed that Count Aehrenthal did not appear to be in great favour at present in Berlin on account of the independent line which he had taken in his dealings with the German Government. His position had been somewhat shaken of late, and the German Govern ment would doubtless not be sorry to get rid of a statesman who had, on more than one occasion, asserted his right to treat with Germany on equal terms. To this the Emperor replied that he could never again place the slightest confidence in anything which Count Aehrenthal might say, and that, if he fell, his successor, whoever he might be, would probably prove no more subservient to Germany than he had been. The bitter tone in which His Majesty said this gave me the impression that, so long as Count Aehrenthal is at the Ballplatz, there is but little chance of an Austro-Russian rapprochement. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] \ BAGDAD RAILWAY. [December 19.] SECRET. * 390EC1910 A Section 2. [45697] No. 1. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 19.) (No. 486. Secret.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, December 13, 1910. IN a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon I told his Excellency that, as the text of the draft agreement which he had submitted to Count Pourtales respecting Persia and the linking up of the two railway systems could only have reached you this morning, I was not able to say what impression it had made on His Majesty’s Government. As, however, there seemed to me to be several points in it which were not very clear, I should like to give him my own personal views with regard to it, so that his Excellency might be able to correct me had I failed to understand the purport of some of its articles. 1 had, I said, always understood that, when the idea of the “ negociations a quatre ” had to be abandoned, that of parallel negotiations had been substituted for it, in order that the Powers of the Triple Entente might be in a position to present a united front to Germany in all matters in which they were respectively interested in connection with the Bagdad Railway. Now, in return for Germany’s renunciation of any claim to railway concessions, &amp;c., in North Persia, Russia, under article 2 of the draft agreement, engaged to link up the Bagdad Railway with the future North Persian railway, when that line had been constructed. That engagement would not render Germany more disposed to meet the wishes of France and Great Britain, though I quite understood the reasons which had induced his Excellency to take it. Article 1, however, went still further, as, were effect to be given to its provisions, Russia, it seemed to me, would have to disinterest herself in all questions touching the construction and control of the Bagdad Railway, and would thus be debarred from co-operating with or supporting France and Great Britain in any diplomatic action w 7 hich they might have to take to safeguard their interests. The gist of the agreement would therefore appear to be that Germany was to have a free hand as regarded the Bagdad Railway, while Russia was to be secured against German competition in North Persia. M. Sazonow replied that article 1 was not nearly so far-reaching as I had imagined, and that it must be read in connection with article 2, where mention was expressly made of the Konia-Bagdad section. The engagement which it contained had only reference to the railway as far as Bagdad, and not to the whole railway system, inclusive of the Gulf section and of its other branches. He did not believe that Germany could ever build the Gulf section by herself. In the first place, she could not find the necessary capital, and, in the second, we would always be able to prevent her by bringing pressure to bear on Turkey. We had but to do what we had done in Persia conjointly with Russia, when we warned the Persian Government that the grant of any concessions that w r ould injuriously affect our strategical or political interests to the subjects of a third Power would be regarded as an unfriendly act. I observed that there seemed to me to be no analogy between the two cases, as the action which we had taken in Persia had reference to future concessions, whereas in the case of the Bagdad Railway we were concerned with a concession which had been granted to Germany years ago. To return, however, to the question of the scope of article 1, I had, I said, not the slightest doubt, from the assurances which he had given Mr. O’Beirne and from what he had told me, as to what his Excellency’s own intentions had been, but I feared that, unless it was distinctly stated in that article that the engagement given by the Russian Government had only reference to the railway as far as Bagdad, a different interpretation might be placed on it by others. M. Sazonow replied that the German Government were fully aware of the limited scope attached to this article. He had, from the very beginning of his conversation at Berlin, referred to the eventual grant of the control of the Gulf section to Great Britain, and, when he had put forward in this connection his request that Russia should have the right to construct the Sadijeh-Khanikin line, the Chancellor had raised no difficulties. No reference was made in the draft agreement to this right, as, owing to its being contingent on the grant of the control of the Gulf section 'to Great Britain, it did not [1821 t —2]2 come within its purview. I replied that, from the experience which I had had ‘ of German methods, I very much doubted whether that Government would remember the explanations which his Excellency had given them when the occasion arose, and that they would be much more likely to hold him to the strict letter of the bond which he was about to sign. I should, therefore, personally prefer, were I in his Excellency’sas position, to alter the text, so that there could be no possible misunderstanding. This M. Sazonow said, was now impossible, as the draft agreement had already been dispatched to Berlin, but he did not anticipate any such misunderstanding. I then enquired whether, after the signature of the agreement, his Excellency would be able so far as the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway was concerned, to co-operate with us and to support us in the future in the same way as in the past. To this M. Sazonow at once replied in the affirmative. I then turned the conversation on to the subject of the speech which the German Chancellor has recently made in the Reichstag respecting the Potsdam interview and the relations between the two Empires. After expressing his satisfaction that M. Bethmann-Hollweg should have publicly confirmed what he had said to him with regard to Germany’s policy in the Near East, M. Sazonow told me that the French Ambassador had just been to see him, and had questioned him with regard to the passage where reference was made to an engagement which had been taken, to the effect that neither of the two Governments would join a combination directed against the other. There was, his Excellency said, not the slightest reason for the uneasiness which this passage had apparently caused at Paris. In the course of their conversa tions, the Chancellor had declared that the German Government had no desire to detach Russia from the Triple Entente, while he (M. Sazonow) had made a similar declaration with regard to the position of Germany in the Triple Alliance. Assurances were subsequently exchanged to the effect that neither of these combinations contained any point that was directed in a hostile sense against Russia or Germany respectivelv. M. Sazonow then observed that the Chancellor had made some interesting remarks on the subject of naval armaments, and enquired whether it was true that His Majesty’s Government had put forward no definite proposals on the subject. I replied that intermittent conversations had taken place between the two Governments, but that His Majesty s Government had, so far, had no occasion to draft any definite proposals. As regarded what the Chancellor had said respecting an economic or political under standing, his Excellency might be sure that His Majesty’s Government would never commit themselves to such a policy without first consulting the Russian Government. Our conversation, which was throughout of the friendliest character, gave me the impression that M. Sazonow was quite sincere in what he told me, but that, owing to ms ack of experience in the. conduct of difficult negotiations and to an unfortunate habit of arriving at his decisions without giving himself sufficient time to reflect on ^ e3 P. possible consequences, he is allowing himself to be out-manoeuvred by M. Ividerlen. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. P.S. I omitted to mention that M. Sazonow told me that the Russian Government had taken no engagement whatever with regard to the question of the 4 per cent, cus oms increase, as they preferred to treat it as a matter quite distinct from the ^ i aC i + ai i Wa ^ff ^ gathered that is the reason why a statement was inserted in ar 1C e o t le effect that no sacrifice of a pecuniary or economic character would he required on the part of Russia.

Section 2. SECRET. [44999] Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received December 13.) St. Petersburgh, December 9, 1910. (No. 482.) Sir, I PAID my first official visit to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon,j and endeavoured to impress upon his Excellency how much His Majesty’s Government had at heart the maintenance of the closest possible understanding with the Russian Government. I had, I said, been charged by yon to deliver many friendly messages to his Excellency, and to assure him of the pleasure which it afforded you to work with him for the furtherance of our respective interests, which were now happily almost identic. M. Sazonow begged me to convey to you his sincere thanks, and to say that he warmly reciprocated your desire for a frank and cordial collaboration on the part of the two Governments. I then proceeded to say that His Majesty’s Government had greatly appreciated the mark of confidence which he had given them in communicating to them the substance of his conversations with the German Chancellor and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. They had been somewhat surprised, however, to learn that the German Government was on the point of concluding an agreement with them with regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. Nothing that had passed in the conversations which had from time to time taken place between Berlin and London led them to expect any such consummation; but should an understanding of this nature ever seem imminent, His Majesty’s Government would not fail to give the French and Russian Governments timely notice, so that they might negotiate simultaneously and on parallel lines whatever arrangement they might consider most consonant to their interests. His Excellency, they believed, was now about to conduct negotiations with the German Ambassador for an agreement, of which one of the principal points would have reference to the linking up of the Bagdad Railway, with an eventual North Persian railway system. They trusted, however, that no definite engagement would be entered into as regards this question until His Majesty’s Government were in a position to come to some understanding with Germany respecting the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. M. Sazonow replied that he feared that this would be impossible. Before going to Berlin he had explained his position to Mr. O’Beirne ; and the assurances which he had since given to the German Government respecting the future linking up of the two railways had been forced on him by the fact that the privileged position which Russia had hitherto enjoyed with regard to railway construction in North Persia had terminated in March of the present year. By agreeing to meet Germany’s wishes on this point, he had secured her renunciation, of all claims to territorial concessions in North Persia, and had thus averted the danger of the concession for the construction of the Tehran-Khanikin branch ever falling into her hands. He had only put forward his demand for the right to construct the Sadijeh-Khanikin line on learning at the Russian Embassy in Berlin that it was commonly reported that the British and German Governments were on the point of coming to terms with regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. His object in doing so had been to see what the Imperial Chancellor would say respecting such an understanding, as well as to obtain some equivalent concession for Russia in the event of Germany being prepared to give satisfaction to the claims of Great Britain and of France. I observed that, were Germany once to obtain a formal and unconditional promise from Russia concerning the linking up of the two railway systems, she would, I feared, be less disposed than ever to come to an understanding with us, more especially as such an understanding would apparently entail her ceding to Russia the construction of the Sadijeh-Khanikin line. I understood, however, that his Excellency had not agreed to any specified term within which the Tehran-Khanikin Railway was to be built, so that he would still be free to withhold the execution of this promise until such time as we also had arranged matters with Germany. M. Sazonow replied that many years must elapse before the latter railway could be constructed, so that we should have ample time to negotiate, and that if we desired it he would welcome British co-operation in the undertaking. [1821 n—2]He had only yesterday commenced his negotiations with the German Ambassador, and thought that they were likely to last some three weeks. He had handed to Count Pourtales a draft project, of which he would send me a copy in the strictest confidence, but some of the proposals which it contained wmdd, he thought, meet with opposition at Berlin. I thanked his Excellency for this fresh proof of his confidence; and the conversation then turned to the questions of the Persian loan and of the conversion of the Russian debt. On my repeating to his Excellency the reasons which, as Mr. O’Beirne had already explained to him, made it impossible for us to throw over the Imperial Bank, M. Sazonow said that he perfectly understood our position. I told him further that we were most anxious to do nothing to cause Russia any embarrassments, that we would use our influence at Tehran to accelerate the conclusion of the Russian conversion scheme, and that, if the Persians proved really intractable, we would not raise objections to such measures as he might deem it necessary to take to safeguard her interests. His Excellency, however, appeared to be in a much calmer and more optimistic frame of mind than I had ventured to hope, and said that now that the Kashan incident had been satisfactorily settled, he did not think that it would be necessary for Russia to have recourse to any coercive measures. Without entering into any details, M. Sazonow gave me to understand that the prospects of an early settlement of the conversion scheme were more favourable than they have been for some time past.

COUNT BENCKENDORFF told me to-day that M. Sazonow was personally favourable to a trans-Persian railway scheme. Count Benckendorff believed that the other members of the Russian Government were also favourably inclined. But he was not in a position to commit his Government with regard to the question, and he could not say anything to me about it officially. I replied that I was in much the same position. Personally, I was favourable to the project, and I thought the result of the good understanding between Russia and us ought to be that the idea of a Russian invasion of India should disappear. The idea had always seemed to me a somewhat remote one. Nevertheless, if the project of the railway became a practical one to which we were committed, the first question we should be asked would be whether all the strategical considerations had been taken into account. I was going to have these looked into, with a view to overcoming any objections there might be. I then pointed out that what had recently passed between M Sazonow and the German Government respecting the Bagdad Railway had made me see that a new factor might have to be taken into account. For, if the Bagdad Railway was to be linked with the trans-Persian Railway, the question would arise whether, in times of Pan-Islamic excitement it might not be possible for a mass of Turkish-Mahommedan troops to be precipitated on to the Indian frontier. Count Benckendorff admitted that this might be a serious consideration; but he explained that M. Sazonow would not favour a junction between Khanikin and Ispahan, but only a junction northwards from Khanikin towards Tehran, and the junction would be made only in the indefinite future. 1 pressed Count Benckendorff as to how M. Sazonow stood with regard to the Bagdad Railway. I reminded him that our position had been that we were quite willing that negotiations should take place between Sir Ernest Cassel, for instance, and Herr Gwinner with the object of securing for us the control of the Bagdad end of the railway; but we had always been quite explicit in saying that, when we found that an arrangement satisfactory to us could be made, we should not be able to confirm it until satisfactory arrangements had been made by Germany with Russia and France. In other words, negotiations might proceed separately with Germany, but a settlement? could not be reached until we were all satisfied. Count Benckendorff said that this was exactly the position of M. Sazonow also. Both as regards the linking-up with Tehran and the concession of a branch from Khanikin to Bagdad, Russia was prepared to be satisfied and herself to satisfy Germany, but she could not accept or make this arrangement until an arrangement had been come to with us and with France as well about the Bagdad Railway. Count Benckendorff made it quite clear, in answer to questions, that the branch from Khanikin to Tehran and from Khanikin to Bagdad were on the same footing in this respect. I expressed satisfaction at hearing that this was the position. But, though I made no observation to Count Benckendorff that would weaken the force of what he had said to me, I think it necessary to observe to your Excellency that M. Sazonow has not yet expressed himself so definitely at St. Petersburgh. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [1821 p-2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET.

SINCE writing my despatch No. 482 of yesterday’s date I have received from M. Sazonow, in the strictest confidence, the text of the accompanying draft agreement, which he has submitted to the German Ambassador, respecting Persia and the linking np of the Bagdad Railway with a fntnre North Persian railway system. In the conversation which I had with his Excellency yesterday, M. Sazonow made a passing allnsion to article 1 of the draft agreement, but treated it as being devoid of any political significance. This article, however, gives me the impression of having been inspired by Germany for the purpose of detaching Russia from ns in any opposi tion which we might make to the realisation of the Bagdad Railway scheme, and the wording of it seems to lend itself to the interpretation that Russia is to be debarred from supporting us in any steps which we may eventually have to take to prevent the Gulf section falling under exclusive German control. The wording of article 2 is somewhat involved, but Russia seems only to engage to link up the two railway systems on the completion of the North Persian railway. She does not undertake to complete that railway within any specified term, so that, by postponing its construction, she still apparently retains her liberty to fix her own time for connecting the Bagdad line with the North Persian railway. It is curious that the draft agreement contains no reference whatever to the question as to whether Russia is to have the right to construct the Bagdad-Khanikin line. M. Sazonow gave Mr. O’Beirne distinctly to understand that Germany had acquiesced in her right to do so, and on my alluding to the subject yesterday, his Excellency, by not contradicting me, tacitly admitted that this was the case. I will take an early opportunity of speaking to M. Sazonow on the various points to which I have referred in this despatch. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft Agreement. I.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received December 9.) (No. 331.) . (Telegraphic.) P. St. Petersburgh, December 9, 1910. I CALLED at the Russian Foreign Office this afternoon and paid my first visit to M. Sazonow. I began the conversation by assuring M. Sazonow that it was the earnest desire of His Majesty’s Government to maintain with the Russian Government the closest possible understanding, and I then told his Excellency how greatly His Majesty s Government had appreciated his action in communicating to them in such a frank and friendly manner the results of the conversations which he had had at Potsdam. His Majesty’s Government had absolutely no reason to suppose that the German Govern ment were about to approach them with a view to coming to any settlement with regard to the Bagdad Railway question, but should such a settlement ever come in sight his Excellency might rest assured that His Majesty’s Government would act in consultation with Russia and France, and, before concluding any arrangement, would give those Powers time to conduct parallel negotiations for a settlement on lines consonant with their respective interests. His Majesty’s Government, on their side, trusted that his Excellency, in the negotiations now proceeding with the German Ambassador here, would not give any engagement to effect a junction of the Bagdad Railway with the future North Persian systems until some satisfactory settlement with regard to the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway had been reached by the British and German Governments. All my remarks as to Anglo-Russian relations were warmly reciprocated by M. Sazonow. His Excellency then went on to explain that he had been forced to enter into an engagement for linking-up the two systems, owing to the fact that the privileged position hitherto enjoyed by Russia with regard to the construction of railways in North Persia had come to an end in the present year, and that it would therefore have been open to Germany to obtain the concession for constructing a line from Khanikin to Tehran had he not met her wishes with regard to linking-up the systems, and so secured her renunciation of her other claims. On my observing that Germany, with this engagement in her pocket, might be less disposed than ever to come to terms with us on the question of the Gulf section, his Excellency replied that the engagement could not take effect until many years had elapsed. His Excellency said that negotia tions with Count Pourtales had begun yesterday, and he promised to let me have a copy of the proposals which he had drafted and submitted to the German Ambassador. He expected that exception would be taken by the German Government to some of these proposals. I expressed to M. Sazonow my thanks for this fresh proof which he was giving of his confidence. I hope to forward to you to-morrow, by safe opportunity,-a copy of these draft proposals. . • -n t &gt; i i. With regard to the scheme for the conversion of the Russian Bank s depts to the Persian Government, M. Sazonow seemed to be in a calm and rather optimistic fiame of mind. He quite understood the position in which His Majesty’s Government stood with regard to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and he hoped, now that a satisfactory solution of the Kashan incident had been reached, that coercive measures would not Rave to be taken by Russia.

It remarks that Herr von Kiderlen has obtained more than was to be expected, seeing that this Russo-German railway agreement, which would open the way for Russia to the Persian Gulf and give Germany access to the markets of Northern Persia, represented a severe blow to British diplomacy. Under this arrange ment Russia and Germany would be the only two Powers having direct connection by railway with Northern and Western Persia. Great Britain, who had done so much for Russia, would have to content herself with the somewhat lengthy and unpractical line from Baku to Nuschki.

I HAD an opportunity yesterday of carrying out the instructions contained in your despatch No. 495, Very Secret, of the 28th ultimo, in regard to the Potsdam interviews. M. Pichon told me that he would communicate to me any further information that reached him respecting them. He had, he said, just had some conversation on the subject with M. Nekludoff, the Russian charge d’affaires. His Excellency had expressed to him surprise and regret at M. Sazonow having embarked on negotiations with the German Government regarding the Bagdad Railway without previous consultation with the French Government. It had been agreed that negotiations on that question should be between the four Governments concerned, and M. Sazonow had treated the matter with the German Government only. M. Pichon considered that it would have been more in accordance with the relations between Russia, France, and England if M. Sazonow had made visits to Paris and London to consult the French and British Governments before committing himself in negotiations at Berlin. M. Nekludoff, though personally regretting that M. Sazonow had found himself under the necessity of negotiating with the German Government without previous consultation with the French and British Governments, contended that only a subsidiary matter connected with the Bagdad Railway had been discussed, viz., its connection with Khanikin, and questions concerning the Russian sphere of interest in Persia. M. Pichon observed to M. Nekludoff that he quite appreciated the desire of M. Sazonow to improve the relations between Russia and Germany, and he accepted the assuiances given that the Potsdam interviews had in no way altered the relations of Russia towaids r ranee and England. Nevertheless, he regretted that M. Sazonow had entered on the work of his office by separate negotiations at Berlin. I have, &amp;c. FRANCIS BERTIE.-A SECRET. [43635] ,'29 DEC 1910 No. 1. Sectioit 2, Memorandum communicated by Mr. F. Huth Jackson, November 29, 1910. M. ALEXANDER ZWEGUINTZOFF caUed on me to-day and explained to me that a Russian consortium liad been formed to promote a Persian railway enterprise. The members of this consortium, so far, are the following :— M. Khomi^koff, ex-president of the Duma. M. Barck, president of the Volga Kama Bank. M. Timiraseff, president of the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade, and ex-Minister of Commerce. M. Patchkovsky, president of the Caucasian Railways Company. M. Bunge (chairman of the consortium) and M. Polaschkofsky, contracting engineers. M. Zweguintzoff, member of the Duma. M. Dumscha and M. Sochansky, engineers who have surveyed the route. M. Gutchkoff, Mayor of Moscow, and partner in the tea firm of Peter Botkin. It is also intended to invite two representatives of the cotton industry to join, and these will probably be :— M. Knoop and M. Morosoff. A representative of the petroleum industry will also be added. M. Zweguintzoff left with me the following memorandum, which embodies the agreement which the consortium has made :— “ 1. The undersigned have formed by private agreement among themselves, and with the knowledge of the Government, a Russian consortium with the object of effecting a junction of the Russian railway system with the Anglo-Indian railways. “ 2. The consortium is formed on the following bases :— “ (1.) The project mentioned in section 1 must be carried out in conjunction with English groups. “ (2.) The negotiations necessary to the object mentioned in the preceding clause are entrusted by the consortium to persons chosen by it. “(3.) The consortium considers that the best way of carrying out the project is that there should be founded in London an organising company to conduct negotiations with the Governments concerned, to obtain concessions, and to promote investigations. “ (4.) The group thinks that the best route is Baku-Kerman-Nushki, with rights— “ (a) To arrange for the transit of petroleum. “ (b.) To make a branch line to the Bay of Chaktbar or to some other point on the coast. u (c.) To construct the necessary ports with also preferential rights to some other branch lines, including lines to Enzeli and to Tehran if the main line avoids those places. The main line and the branch line to the sea must be secured from being crossed by other railways or from being connected with them. The transit rates must be fixed on equal conditions for Russian and for British goods. The arrangements for through traffic (passengers and goods) must be fixed by special agreement with the other railways concerned. “ (5.) The participation of Russians and of Englishmen must be equal. The measure of participation of Frenchmen, Persians, and other foreign groups must be fixed by agreement with these groups, securing a corresponding portion of orders to those factories within the limits of Russia in which the corresponding group is interested. “ (6.) The undersigned enter into agreement wdth rights of promoters, independent of their possible participation as representatives of various firms. The promoters are entitled, without payment, to promoters’ shares, both in the organising company (section 2’, article 3) and in the Persian Through Railway Company, and in any [2991/-2] ■ :auxiliary organisation whicli may be founded to support it.. These shares participate in the profits only in case the latter are sufficient to pay a dividend of 6 per cent, on all shares of the company. After this 6 per cent, has been paid there will be paid from the surplus £ per cent, on each promoter’s share. “ (7.) The number of promoters’ shares is fixed at twenty. The promoters are entitled to co-opt new members by a special resolution, in each case accepted by not less than three-fourths of the votes of all the promoters. Shares not assigned at the time of the foundation of the organising company shall be destroyed. “ (8.) To meet all expenses connected with the formation of the organising company, e.g., the drawing up, transcribing, and pointing of materials and^business memoranda, travelling, and other expenses in the conduct of negotiations, is formed a special fund of not more than 20,000 roubles, which must be returned to the contributors when the above-named company is formed. “ Approving of the above agreement, the undersigned, meeting on the 22nd June (5th July), 1910, in St. Petersburgh, resolved to form a Russian consortium, and unanimously elected as its director A. A. Bunge.” The discussion between us was of a desultory character, and, as far as I was concerned, 1 confined myself mainly to asking questions. The only statement I made was that it must be distinctly understood that my position in this and any other conversations that might take place was for the present only that of an interrogator for the purpose of advising the Foreign Office later on as to whether, in my opinion, the financial possibilities of the scheme were sufficiently attractive to warrant an English group being formed for the purpose of raising a portion of the capital necessary to build the railway. M. Zweguintzoff positively stated that any arrangement that was made must be on the basis of an equal participation of Russian and British interests, which must under all circumstances retain a predominating influence over the concern. French and Belgian capital would undoubtedly be invited to co-operate, and he seemed to think that the participation of German capital would also be desirable. He evidently anticipates considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary concessions from the Persian Government. An application for the concessions must, in his opinion, be made on behalf of the railway company as a private corporation, backed by the support of the Russian and British Governments, and the success of this application will probably depend upon the amount of financial benefit (in one form or another) that the Persian Government is going to get for the granting of the concessions. M. Timiraseff is expected to arrive in London on Thursday morning. He knows more of the financial particulars of the proposal, wdiile M. Zweguintzoff has concerned himself more with the political side. I have agreed to meet M. Timiraseff either on Friday or Tuesday next, and have suggested that M. Zweguintzoff should accompany M. Timiraseff to my office when he comes. 12, Tokenhouse Yard, London, November 29, 1910.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] BAGDAD RAILWAY. ' ,.&lt;C [ ■' C [November 29.] SECRET. S 1 ' .A.. . ... . Section 1. [43414] No. 1. Mr. 0 Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 29.) (No. 461. Confidential.) St. Petersburgh, November 24, 1910. I RECEIVED a few days ago a letter from M. Sazonow enclosing a memorandum entitled “ Russian and German Railway Interests in Persia,” and stating that he would like to know what I thought of it. It seems unnecessary to trouble you with a full translation of this memorandum, which is of considerable length, but of which the important parts can be resumed in a few words. It is evidently written by a person interested in the trans-Persian railway scheme who is not aware of the details of what passed at Potsdam, and it is directed towards showing the necessity of proceeding with the scheme before further progress has been made with the Bagdad line. It deals with the question in its relation (1) to the transit trade from Europe to India, and (2) to the north Persian market. The writer assumes that the construction of the Bagdad Railway as far as Bagdad itself is. a matter of some years only, and observes that the German company, by its concession, has the right of building various branches to the Persian frontier, of which the most important is the branch from Sadij eh to Khanikin. The Germans realise the immense difficulties of carrying their railway from the point at which it will touch the Persian Gulf forward along the Persian coast towards India. It is natural, therefore, that they should entertain the project of prolonging it via Khanikin either to Tehran and thence to the Baluchistan frontier, or else, as has been recommended by Dr. Gwinner himself, to Ispahan and onwards. Of these two routes the latter is materially shorter, but it also presents greater physical difficulties. Both routes are so far longer than the proposed trans-Persian line via Baku that the transit trade to India would necessarily be monopolised by the latter. The writer argues, however, that if the German line reaches Bagdad before the Baku-Tehran line is built the Germans will prolong their line across Persia via Khanikin, whereas they will have little inducement to do so if they find the shorter transit route already in being. As regards the north Persian market, the author of the memorandum points out that when the German railway reaches Khanikin the present system of protecting Russian industry by transit dues on European goods coming through Batoum and the Caucasus will cease to be efficacious. For the construction of a branch railway from Adana on the Bagdad Railway to Mersina will establish through railway communication from the Mediterranean to the Persian frontier, and European goods will follow that route instead of arriving through the Caucasus. Therefore, the writer concludes, Russia must resign herself to the prospect of increasing competition from European goods in the north Persian market. Her only resource is, so far as possible, to strengthen her hold on the market beforehand, and for that purpose she should build the Baku-Tehran line as soon as possible. As you will observe, the memorandum 'is written throughout on the assumption that the extension of the Bagdad Railway to the Persian frontier (if not beyond it) will be carried out by Germany, and the question is treated as one simply of competition between the future Russian and the future German lines. The matter presents a somewhat different aspect on the supposition that Russia makes good her claim to the Sadijeh-Khanikin branch, and herself constructs the extension of that branch to Tehran. I said to M. Sazonow, when discussing the subject with him on the 22nd instant, that it occurred to me that as soon, at any rate, as the German railway reached Bagdad, Germany would expect Russia to commence the construction of the branch from Sadijeh, and that she would object to the construction of that branch being indefinitely delayed while the line from Baku to Tehran was built. Russia might thus find herself in the position of having simultaneously to build the two lines, which were mutually competitive. M. Sazonow replied that Germany might dislike the idea of priority being given to the Baku-Tehran line, but that she could do nothing to prevent it, because Russia had not bound herself (nor would she do so) to commence the construction of the line [2991/—1]from Sadi jell wit hin any specified time. Besides, the construction of that line was necessarily a long way off, whereas the Baku—Tehran line might he built in a very short time. He was informed that the whole trans-Bersian line via Tehran could he completed in two years. . } M. Sazonow thus seems to contemplate the possibility of Russia s commencin &gt;« railway construction in north Persia in the immediate future, and no doubt, if fils anticipations are realised, the question of priority between the two competing lines could in practice hardly arise. It seems clear, however, that if Russia should remain inactive until the German railway approaches Bagdad, Germany would have good grounds to ask that the extension of the line to.the Persian frontier and beyond should be taken in hand at the least simultaneously with the construction of the projected line from Baku. M. Sazonow made an observation on another point, which may be of importance. The promoters of the trans-Persian scheme now, he said, proposed that the railway should run from Tehran southwards to Ispahan, and thence to Yezd and Kerman. This, he said, would make it comparatively easy for the extension of the German line to intersect the trans-Persian line at Ispahan. He considered it preferable, therefore, that the trans-Persian line should take a south-easterly direction from Tehran towards Kerman, even though it would then traverse the desert.

Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 21.) (No. 457.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, November 16, 1910. I HAVE the honour to report that the “ Novoe Vremya ” to-day publishes an article in which reference is again made to the alleged agreement arrived at during the Potsdam conversations between M. Sazonow and the German negotiators respecting Russian railway construction in Persia and the Bagdad Railway scheme. The article declares that the agreement by which friction in Persia injurious to Russian interests has been removed has been reached at the cost of a Russian promise to link up the future Persian system of railways with the Bagdad line. The writer, whilst fully recognising the value of any agreement securing tranquillity in Persia, considers it superfluous to state to whom this particular agreement is the more advantageous— Russia or Germany. He quotes figures to show that at present more than half of Persia’s foreign trade is in Russian hands, a fact which the “Novoe Vremya” attributes principally to the geographical position of the two countries. This advantage will be lost with the opening of railway communication from the centre of Persia westward to the Mediterranean Sea. The “Novoe Vremya” therefore urges immediate reorganisation and improvement of the existing waterways connecting the central industrial regions of Russia with the Caspian Sea and Persian ports, which, in the opinion of this paper, will materially lessen the harmful effect to Russian trade of the invasion of Persia, which seems inevitable in the future, by cheap European goods. The article then discusses the scheme for a new “world-route” from Baku across Persia to the nearest railway station on the Indian system—Nushki—and declares that since the question of linking up Russian railways in Persia with lines of other countries has arisen the matter should be carried out to its logical conclusion. An extension of the Russian railway system from Baku to Nushki would give a continuous line from Calais to Bombay of 8,250 versts, which would reduce the length of the journey between these two ports by seven to seven and a half days. This would be sufficient to convert the new route to India into a “ world ” route by which all the mails would travel and the majority of first and second class passengers. It would involve the construction of about 2,300 versts—1,800 versts from Baku vifi Tehran to the Perso- Indian frontier and 500 versts farther to Nushki. The “Novoe Vremya” admits that such an enormous undertaking of general European importance could not be carried out by Russia alone nor solely by Russian enterprise. A similar idea was considered in Russia in the eighties, and has now been restored to life, and is being placed on a practical footing. Something in the nature of a preliminary committee has been formed in Russia for the consideration of a general plan for its realisation. Einanciers and engineers from France, England, and Germany will be invited to take part in the deliberations, so that the matter immediately becomes invested with an international character.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 28.) (No. 852.) k* 11 ’’ ^ Constantinople, November 23, 1910. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad reporting that Sir W. Willcocks now advocates the construction of a railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, to afford an outlet for the produce of the districts comprised in the Mesopotamian irrigation works, instead of the railway direct to the Mediterranean, of which he was formerly an ardent champion. Sir W. Willcocks has submitted his plans to the Vali of Bagdad. It is more than probable that such a line would be a paying concern, but there is one obvious objection to it from the point of view of the Turkish Treasury, viz., that it must by its competition reduce the receipts on the Bagdad-Bussorah section of the German Bagdad Railway, and pro tanto increase the liability of the Turkish Government under the heading of kilometric guarantees, which, as you will remember, are calculated over the whole of the line, and not over the individual sections. Froni our own point of view it occurs to me that it is to be apprehended that if Sir W. Willcocks’s proposal were carried into effect by the Turkish Government, or on its account by a syndicate, some arrangement might be come to between the Germans and the Porte by which, when the German railway reached Bagdad from the west, the Willcocks railway would be taken over by them and incorporated in the German line. The. Germans would thus avoid competition, the Ottoman Treasury would escape from increased liability in respect of kilometric guarantees, and the Bagdad Railway would be carried to the shores of the Persian Gulf at an earlier date than if built continuously from the west. 1 ^CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General* Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 937. Very Confidential.) Your Excellency, ' Bagdad, October 17, 1910. . I HAVE the honour to enclose copies of a correspondence regarding a project which appears to me to be of the highest importance, namely, the construction of a railway via the Tigris valley between Bagdad and Bussorah. Next to Sir William Willcocks’s schemes for the irrigation of Mesopotamia generally, this project is, in my opinion, the most important which has claimed notice since my appointment to Bagdad a year ago, and I trust that your Excellency may see fit to submit the papers, though containing little more than a rather indefinite suggestion, to His Majesty’s Government. Sir William Willcocks was formerly, as is known, the strong partisan of a direct railway across the desert from Bagdad to the Mediterranean, but he has lately been impressed by some of the disadvantages inseparable from such a scheme, and he now proposes, as an alternative to his original recommendations, a line to connect Bagdad with the Persian Gulf. It is understood that the Turkish authorities hold that the security of a line running largely through unsettled Arab country might not be altogether easy to guarantee ; there might also be trouble as to the terms on which a line towards the Mediterranean could be connected with the Syrian railway system ; and, at the other end, the necessity of crossing the German Bagdad Railway in order to arrive at Bagdad might give rise to complications. But it appears that the change in Sir William Willcocks’s views is due principally to an observation by Sir E. Cassel, who pointed out to him that the distance to the sea for purposes of railway construction [2991 ee—1]2 should be measured, not from Bagdad, but from tbe centre of gravity of the large tract m Irak, which steps are now being taken to irrigate, dins centre, it is apparently admitted by Sir William Willcocks, will lie somewhere between Bagdad and Bussorah, and will therefore be very much nearer to the Persian Gulf than to the Mediterranean. From conversations with Sir William Willcocks I have gathered that what he fl. contemplates is a self-supporting line, such as could be constructed without any financial guarantee on the part of the Turkish Government, and that he believes such a line to be a possibility. Whether Sir William Willcocks is or is not right in this last opinion is a question which can only be decided on statistics and estimates (actual and prospective) of production, exportation, and importation. I am endeavouring to arrange for the collection of these, but it seems inadvisable to delay the present despatch until they have been prepared, especially as the matter of the railway has other political bearings which His Majesty’s Government will wish time to consider. It may be observed here, however, that railway transport between Bagdad and Bussorah would certainly be more rapid and reliable than that by river steamer which at present exists ; and Sir William Willcocks, in conversation, has adduced figures tending to show that it might also be cheaper. The time taken by travellers between the two places 'would be reduced from four or five days to something under twenty-four hours ; and in the case of goods, also, traffic would no doubt be greatly accelerated; while accumulations of merchandise at either end of the line, due to the absence of sufficient carrying power when business is brisk, could probably be avoided with a railway. The navigation of the Tigris during some months of the year* is already difficult and uncertain, owing to physical obstacles ; and it is manifest that if the river should be tapped above Bagdad for purposes of irrigation—an operation without which the country cannot attain to its maximum agricultural development—it would become unnavigable below Bagdad, at least for part of the year, by vessels of the size and build owned by the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and the (Turkish) Idarah Nahriyah. The freights charged by the river steamers are, I believe, heavy ; but, until I have had an opportunity of comparing them with the freights for goods carried on Indian railways, I cannot express any opinion as to the probability of railway rates being lower. If the construction of a non-guaranteed Bagdad-Bussorah railway is shown to be economically feasible, further question will at one arise which His Majesty’s Government may perhaps desire to examine in advance. The two principal of these appear to he the following:— 1. Whether the new project would in any way conflict with Turkey’s international obligations ? 2. Whether, and to what extent, and bj^ what means—supposing the enterprise to be economically sound and politically practicable—the participation of British subjects in it can be arranged ? Both of these questions evidently lie beyond the scope of a local officer such as myself. I may remark that the sentiments of the Bagdad Local Government, if they were correctly reflected in language which Eram Bey, their political secretary, lately held in conversation with me, appear to be extremely favourable to Sir William Willcocks’s new railway project; and I even gather that the project itself has become a sort of bond of union between its author and the vilayet, so much so that it may possibly have the effect of modifying a tendency to disagreement between them upon other subjects. Eram Bey told me that the short land route from Lower Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf appeared to him a more natural outlet for the products of Mesopotamia, notwithstanding the great length of the sea voyage from Bussorah to Europe, than the long land route to the Mediterranean via Syria. He also expressed great joy at the prospect, which seemed to him realisable, of Turkey’s being able to establish a valuable line of railway communication in Mesopotamia free from the unfavourable conditions^ contained in the German Bagdad Railway concession. Sir William Willcocks s observation, at the end of his letter to the vali, about the transference of the Persian transit trade from Bagdad to Mohammareh, is in my opinion,! well founded; and this aspect of the matter is of supreme importance to the Turkish Government. * See Summary of Events for September 1910, XI—7. f See Summary of Events for September 1910, VIII—2.i The substitution of railway for river steamer carriage would necessarily bring to an end the shipping business which the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have conducted here with great efficiency and success for many years; but I do not anticipate that the British Government, though they may regard € +&gt;, e company as entitled to compensation on account of the drying-up of the Tigris by e act of the Turkish Government and the consequent virtual invalidation of the company’s concession from the Porte, will consider that any protest lies against the construction of an internal railway in Turkey on the ground of its competition with a previously established British concern. In case of compensation being granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company for the destruction of the Tigris as a navigable river, it might take the form, in whole or in part, of an interest conferred on them gratis in the new railway company. I have, &amp;c. J. G. LORIMER, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir W. Willcocks to Consul-General Lorimer. My dear Lorimer, Bagdad, October 7, 1910. I ENCLOSE two copies of a plan, # showing all possible railways between Bagdad and Bussorah. As far as I can see, I shall be forced to make an escape for the Tigris down the impression which runs from the extreme end of Ctesiphon curve down to Nasria. Once the escape is made, the Tigris in the Amara reach will be capable of great development, and I must carefully examine the tract which hitherto I have overlooked, as it is a kind of washpot for the Tigris. The first result will be that the line of railway down the left bank of the Tigris from Bagdad to Kut, and thence to Amara, Gurna, and Bussorah, will become an excellent line of railway, the shortest and the best between Bagdad and Bussorah. The navigation of the Tigris downstream of Amara hangs on such a fine thread, and may any day come to a dead stop, that we shordd be ready with an alternative Tigris railway. Bagdad without the Tigris navigation will be an unimportant town unless a railway quickly takes its place. Mind, the Euphrates has completely changed its course in two different places, and so can the Tigris. It has done so in the past. Yours sincerely, W. WILLCOCKS. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Sir W. Willcocks to Consul-General Lorimer. My dear Lorimer, Bagdad, October 15, 1910. I HAVE already sent you plans and a letter about this. I send you copy of the letter I sent the vali. If we are not ready beforehand with our railway through the National Bank of Turkey or some other interested party, and suddenly the Tigris is shut to navigation, the Turkish Government will in despair have to call for the damnable and useless desert railway of the Germans, useless to all except the Anatolian Railway shark. Now that the railway can go profitably along the left bank of the Tigris I am working up the Nahrwan project, and hope to have it in the first hatch of work. Yours sincerely, W. WILLCOCKS.

Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 18.) (No. 445. Secret.) St. Petersburgh, November 9, 1910. I HAVE the honour to state that at an interview which I had with M. Sazonow yesterday morning he gave me the following information as to what had passed at Potsdam between him and the German Govermnent in reference to Persia and the Bagdad Railway. His Excellency began by saying that on arriving in Berlin he found that the impression existed at the Russian Embassy that Germany was on the point of coming to terms with Great Britain on the subject of the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway. With this information to start with, he had opened conversation with the German Chancellor by saying that he supposed it was a foregone conclusion that the principle of the sectionnement of the Bagdad Railway would have to be adopted, and that the Bagdad-Gulf section would go to England. Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg had not protested, nor had he expressed dissent from this assumption, but he had appeared to acquiesce in it. The Chancellor had in fact “ done everything but say ” that Germany was ready to agree to an arrangement such as M. Sazonow had indicated, and M. Sazonow had derived the same impression from the language of Herr von Kiderlen- Wachter. I told his Excellency as to this point that His Majesty’s Government had no reason whatever to think that Germany was disposed to make an arrangement acceptable to them with regard to the Bagdad] Railway, and that nothing had passed between them and the German Government recently on the subject. M. Sazonow had, he proceeded to tell me, said to the German Chancellor that if the Gulf section went to England he would readily understand that Russia could not remain empty-handed. She would claim the branch from Sadijeh to Khanikin. In this stipulation the German Chancellor had, M. (Sazonow said, acquiesced, and the Germans had further agreed not to build any line in Turkish territory touching the Persian frontier at a point north of Khanikin. In the negotiations regarding Persia, the neutral zone was not even mentioned by the German statesmen. In any case, M. Sazonow said to me, this was a subject which could only be treated d trois in concert with Great Britain. As regards the Russian sphere, the German negotiators had made no difficulties as to Russian requirements respecting concessions. M. Sazonow had asked that Germany should agree not to seek for railway or telegraph concessions or generally concessions of a territorial character, and as to this demand the German negotiators had made no objections and seemed to acquiesce. The only undertaking to which M. Sazonow on his side bound himself was that the Bagdad Railway system, when in the future it reached the Persian frontier, should be connected at Khanikin with the North Persian S 3 r stem. I asked whether Russia had undertaken to commence railway construction in Persia wdthin any specified time, and his Excellency answered in the negative. Germany, he further said, had made no request for participation in the supply of materials for the railways, and he had therefore kept what he had to offer in this respect “ in his pocket.” The. Germans had, however, stipulated that no differential railway rates should be instituted by Russia on lines which she controlled. A detailed agreement was, M. Sazonow informed me, to be negotiated in St. Peters- burgh with the German Ambassador. He remarked that Germany might then very likely bring forward further demands on certain points, but that he proposed to adhere to the position which he had taken up when at Potsdam. I need hardly say that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the conversation,- which I had with him before his departure, gave me no indication that he intended to make a claim for the Sadijeh-Khanikin branch. The way in which he spoke of the junction of the two railway systems at Khanikin showed, I think, clearly that at that time he contemplated that railway construction under Russian auspices should begin at the Persian frontier. M. Sazonow may perhaps have had it in his mind to nut [2991 5-2] , *t a n oim fnr flip Khanikm brancli m tli6 way of kargaining, tut I do not belTeve that he had any serious expectation that the claim would he entertained by Germany. j have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. p g From some further conversation which I have had with M. Sazonow since writing this despatch, I find that as regards the stipulation which he made concerning the Khanikin-Sadij eh branch, it might be safer to say not that the German Chancellor acquiesced, but that he mutely signified acquiescence. ^ ^ November 14, 1910,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s GovernmentJ [November 16.] Section 1, [41875] No. 1.

Sazonow yesterday spoke to me further on the subject of the appioachmg negotiations. _ _ . He observed that as there was no financial possibility of constructing railways m Northern Persia for years to come, the discussion respecting these railways would be in a sense academic. Should the German negotiators touch on the question of the. neutral zone, he would state that he was not prepared to discuss it without consulting His Majesty’s Government. In connection with the Russian sphere he would not mention England (though in this respect also he recognised his obligations to His Majesty’s Government), as he feared that to do so would render the Germans ill-disposed to negotiate. He repeated, however, that he would refuse to conclude any arrangement in regard to this sphere until after his return to St, Petersburgh. His Excellency said that in addition to his demands in regard to concessions, he w r as going to ask Germany to agree not to build any branch of the Bagdad Railway connecting with the Persian system at a point north of Lhanikm , he lemarked that Germany was legally entitled to apply for concessions, and stated that his fear was that on his side he had very little to offer in return for asking the Germans to refrain from making such applications. . . He could offer to undertake that Khanikin should be the point of junction of the Bao'dad and Persian Railways systems, and he was also ready to agree to German participation in the supply of material for future railways in Northern Persia (he was prepared to concede this even up to 30 per cent.), but this, he said, hardly seemed sufficient as a quid pro quo. He doubted if Germany would adhere to the attitude which she had adopted when she intimated that she had no intention of seeking concessions embarrassing to Russia and England. • -i ^ n I made the suggestion to M. Sazonow that he could remind the German Govern ment that Great Britain and Russia possessed exclusive political interests in Persia,, and that these interests had always been recognised. The Persian Government had been publicly warned by the tw r o Powers that they could not peimit certain concessions to be granted, and there had been a practical acquiescence in the principle thus laid down on the part of Germany and other Powers. . , There was no allusion, in the course of our conversation, to tire possibility ol Germany requesting the definite assent of the Russian Government to the Bagdad Railway scheme, i learn, however, from the French Ambassador, that M.

[November 7.] SECRET. [40355] Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 7.) (No. 432. Very Confidential.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, October 30, 1910. I HAVE the hononr to report that I saw the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday on the eve of his departure for Germany, and that he spoke to me further regarding the approaching negotiations at Potsdam. His Excellency commenced by remarking that the discussion concerning Persian railways would necessarily be “ academic,” in the sense that there was from the financial point of view no possibility of railways being built in North Persia for many years to come. I replied that it was also the view of His Majesty’s Government that there was no present question of building railways in Persia. It was only a question of ear-marking concessions for them. Going on to speak of the details of the negotiations, M. Sazonow said that if the negotiators on the German side touched on the subject of the neutral zone in Persia he would at once decline to go into it, on the ground that it was a question in which England was concerned, and that he could not discuss it without previous consultation with His Majesty’s Government. As regards the Russian sphere he did not intend to mention Great Britain, although he recognised his obligations to His Majesty’s Government in that respect also, because he thought that to do so would unfavourably dispose the German negotiators. He would, however, state, as was the fact, that it was quite impossible for him to conclude anything regarding this sphere until after he had returned to St. Petersburgh and had an opportunity of consulting the Finance Minister and other members of the Government. He had, proceeded M. Sazonow, been thinking very carefully over these negotiations, and his fear was that he had no sufficient quid 'pro quo to offer to Germany in return for what he was going to ask from her. He was going to ask that she should engage not to apply to the Persian Government for concessions of a territorial character in the Russian sphere ; that is to say, he was asking her to abstain from doing what she had a perfect legal right to do. He was also, he should tell me, going to ask that Germany should agree not to build any railway in the future connecting with the Persian railway system at a point north of Khanikin. This was a matter of importance to Russia from strategic considerations. What had he to offer in return for these demands ? He could offer to engage that if and when the railway from Tehran to the Turkish frontier was built Khanikin should form the point of junction with the Bagdad railway system. That was what Germany desired, but as a concession it did not amount to much. I said, what else did Germany ask ? M. Sazonow replied that he supposed that she would ask for participation in the contract connected with the construction of the future railways, and here he was ready to meet her. He was prepared to give her a participation, even to the amount of 30 per cent., in the supply of materials (“ fournitures ”) for the future lines, although, he remarked, he was aware that His Majesty’s Government objected to such participation (as regards the British sphere). I said that I was under the impression that you did not exclude the idea of some share of the contracts going to Germany. The essential thing for Russia, M. Sazonow said, was that the railways in the north should be a Russian enterprise (“ sous le drapeau russe ”). There were, then, these two concessions which he had to bargain with—the junction of the two railway systems and participation in the supply of materials. Were they, M. Sazonow asked, sufficient to induce Germany to renounce the right of herself seeking for a concession to build a line to Tehran ? He appeared extremely doubtful on the point. He was aware that the German Government had intimated that they would not seek for concessions embarrassing to the two Powers, but that intimation had not been made unconditionally, and, besides, his Excellency said, did I suppose that the German Government would let it stand greatly in their way? I suggested to his Excellency that he could point out to the German Government that Great Britain and Russia had exclusive political interests in Persia, which had [2991 y—4]always been recognised on all hands. The two Powers had given a warning to the Persian Government, which was really a public warning, to. the effect that they could not admit certain kinds of concessions being given to subjects of other Powers, and Germany had practically acquiesced in the principle thus laid down. M. Sazonow, while appearing to agree that he could speak in that sense at Potsdam, showed a certain amount of anxiety and pessimism as to the result of the negotiations. No allusion was made in the course of our conversation to the possibility of Germany asking for Russia’s definite assent to the principle of the Bagdad railway scheme, though I daresay that his Excellency may have had such a possibility in his mind! The French Ambassador has, however, informed me that M. Sazonow has intimated to him that he will avoid committing himself in regard to that question (“ qu’il reserverait la question ”).

The article goes on to point out that it is only right that, when French capital is lent to a foreign country, it should be under stood that such capital shall not be laid out in a manner likely to prove injurious to French interests. Large orders for military and naval armament were at present being placed by the Porte in Germany, and France was justified in demanding for her industries orders of at least an equal amount. In conclusion, the article expresses the hope that Hakki Pasha will succeed in setting matters on their former footing. I have, &amp;c. FRANCIS BERTIE. P.S.

His Excellency made the following statement in reply to a question as to whether he had insisted that the loan should be issued by the Ottoman Bank: “ Votre renseignement ne repond pas a la realite des choses, et vous faites fausse route.” M.

(No. 349. Confidential.) Sir, Paris, September 14, 1910. I HAD the honour to receive last night your telegraphic instructions No. 315 of yesterday, and this morning I had an interview with M. Louis at the Quai d’Orsay. His Excellency had not seen any report from the French Ambassador in London of the observations made to him by Sir Charles Hardinge and of your views in regard to the financial condition of Turkey, recorded in your despatch* No. 225 of the 30th April last to me. He therefore took notes of its contents so that he might be in a position to discuss with M. Pichon, who will be in Paris to-morrow for a few hours, the representations which you had instructed me to make and which I communicated to the Ambassador. His Excellency entirely concurred in your opinion of the advisability of co-operation between the British and French Ambassadors at Constantinople in impressing upon the Turks the absolute necessity of maintaining their financial stability and of developing the country on progressive lines, and in your opinion that, in the event of their continuing a reckless course of expenditure, they would find it hard to find money in Paris or London to meet their requirements. The attitude which the French Government have taken in regard to the projected Turkish loan of 6,000,000Z. is, M. Louis states, as follows :— Inasmuch as French investments in Turkey and the Turkish debt amount to .about 100,000,000Z., it is the bounden duty of the French Government to scrutinise the necessity for and the security for any further charges on the Turkish revenues. They are not satisfied with the present conduct of Turkish finance, and desire to see proper reforms and control instituted by the Turks themselves, and that there should be no concealment in regard to the expenditure of the funds at the disposal of the Porte. Mahmoud Shefket Pasha desires to obtain as much money as possible for the army regardless of the necessity for economy and for expenditure in other services of the State. The Young Turk party wish to have command of funds to assure a continuance of their influence and the predominance of their views. The French Government are not at all pleased with Djavid Bey. His great object seems to be the concealment of past expenditure and the obtaining of money for unavowed purposes. The French Government do not desire, as Djavid Bey asserted, to establish a French control. They will be content that the control shall be Turkish, provided that it be effective and that there be a proper budget. M. Louis regrets that the Turkish Government do not adopt the financial system which answered so well in Macedonia under Emin Pasha. With regard to the question of the Bagdad Railway, M. Louis said that political conditions had not been introduced into the discussions as to the terms on which a quotation of a loan of 6,000,COOL would be allowed on the Paris market. The French Government attached importance on not, by refusing financial assistance to Turkey at the present moment, appearing to be in opposition to the Young Turk party, and seeming to throw obstacles in the way of an improvement in the Turkish army. The sum of 6,000,000k would not suffice for the needs of the Turkish Government. They would soon require a further loan, and the question is whether it would not be advisable to let them have the 6,000,000k on reasonable financial and without political conditions and bring the latter forward when they applied for a further loan. I suggested to M. Louis that the Porte might manipulate part of the 6,000,000k in such a manner as to set free certain charges which might then be utilised for the purposes of the Bagdad Railway and the advancement of the interests of Germany and to the detriment of those of France and England whose duty it is to defend their political as well as their financial interests. M. Louis having referred to the threats of the Turkish inspired press that Turkey might obtain money elsewhere than on the Paris market, I said that, though His Majesty’s Government have not the power in regard to a quotation of loans possessed by the French Government, I thought that Sir Ernest Cassel, who had been mentioned as willing to undertake a loan, would not [2921 5-1]Tdg inclined to run counter to tlie wishes of His Majesty s Government and British interests in this particular matter, and that theie might he means of discouraging London financial houses from entertaining proposals for _ a loan if the French Government refused their consent to a .Quotation of the projected d,000,0001. except on terms concerted between the British and French Governments which would include an arrangement in regard to the Bagdad Railway. M. Louis admitted the danger of part of the loan being' used to the disadvantage of the political interests of France and England, and he undertook to bring before M. Pichon to-morrow the representation which I had made by your direction, viz., that m the absence of any stipulation on the subject of the application of the loan it may either directly or indirectly be utilised in part to hasten the completion of the Bagdad Railway to the exclusion of any participation in the undertaking by France and England and the imposing a great burden on the Turkish Exchequer to the advantage of Germany and the Turkish military party, and that in these circumstances it would be advisable during the discussions on the loan to stipulate for a satisfactory settlement of the railway question inclusive of a modification of the onerous financial clauses of the concession of 1903 and the participation of France and England in the undertaking.

Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey—(Received September 26.) (No. 380. Confidential.) ^ ir ’ TQAm + , +1 * . „ St - Petersburgh, September 17, 1910. I SAID yesterday to tlie Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that 1 supposed there was no truth m the recent rumours as to the negotiation of a military convention between Turkey and Germany and Austria. M. Sazonow said that he did not believe in the conclusion of a military convention. Turkey would, in his opinion, not incur the ill-will of Great Britain and Russia by taking such a step. But he thought that there had been conversations between her and the two central European Powers with regard to railways in Asia Minor. He suspected that this matter had been touched on by Hakki Pasha m Manenbad and by Djavid Bey in Berlin, and he appeared to think that Austria had acted as an intermediary between the other two Powers. His Excellency said that his principal reason for fancying that something of the kind indicated had been taking place was the attitude assumed bv the Turkish Government in the question of the Samsun-Sivas railway. Russia and France had been moving for the concession for this railway, of which Russia held the option as against any Power other than Turkey herself. The Ottoman Government had made difficulties about granting a concession, expressing an intention of constructing the line themselves. In reality it was Germany that desired to include this line in her Anatolian railway system, and M. Sazonow suspected that a plan was in contemplation by which Germany would finance the construction of the railway, which would be nominally undertaken by the Turkish Government. The position taken up by Russia was that Turkey was at liberty to build the railway if she could find the means required for so doing “ within the limits of her budget.” M. Sazonow remarked to me that the Samsun-Sivas railway had a certain importance, but it was as nothing compared to that of a trans-Persian line which would connect the Russian and the British-Indian systems. That, he said, was the real counter-move to make to the Bagdad Railway scheme, but he feared that Anglo-Indian opinion was not yet ripe for it. He was far from underrating the value of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. That was “ a great thing ” accomplished, but his Excellency gave me to understand that it would, in his opinion, never yield the full value of which it was capable until it was completed by the adoption of the trans-Persian railway scheme, which would, he said, reduce the Bagdad line to a position of entire insignificance.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 359 of yesterday’s date, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, extracted from this evening’s “ Temps,” a leading article on the failure of the Turkish loan negotiations in Paris. The “ Temps ” and the “Journal des D6bats” both comment with some bitterness on the subject and both reproach Sir Ernest Cassel with having pro-German tendencies which have gained for him the sympathies of the Young Turk party. The “ Temps ” article lays stress on the fact that it is almost admitted in the Turkish organ, the “ Tanin,” that Turkey has joined, or is about to join, the Triple Alliance, and it declares that the French Government must, apart from all financial . questions, obtain the satisfaction due to them for the incidents at Smyrna and in Syria reported in my despatches Nos. 352, 355, and 343 of the 15th, 17th, and 11th instant respectively. The “ Journal des Debats,” in an article which I also enclose herein, draws attention to the difficulties with which Sir Ernest Cassel will have to contend in order to find the 6,000,000k for the Turkish loan. The Paris bankers would not be willing to raise the money unless the loan were admitted to a quotation on the Paris Bourse, and Sir Ernest Cassel’s credit on the London market was not extensive enough to enable him to find the necessary sum there without the moral support of His Majesty’s Government and the backing of public opinion—both of which he would fail to obtain. In this particular case, where the influence in the East of Great Britain, France, and Bussia is at stake, His Majesty’s Government would only act in agreement with the French Government.

M. Pichon informs me that he has called the attention of the French Ambassador at Constantinople to the provisions of article 1 of the protocol of the 25th April, 1907, as to the duration of the 11 per cent, duty ad valorem, and to the fact that the consent of the various Governments to the increased tax was by article 5 made dependent on the execution of certain engagements on the part of the Porte relative to legislation on mines and analyses, the storing of petroleum, the improvement of the customs service, and the construction of new buildings for this service ; and he has suggested to the French Ambassador that the Ottoman Government might be usefully and opportunely reminded of these points now that they are thinking of giving as security for a loan the customs of the Constantinople vilayet.

[27275] [Amended Copt.] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. It v/ I | ' ' { 1 Majesty's faovemment.] [July 27.] Section 2. on jDjavid Bey to-day, and discussed with him the questions of the Bagdad Kadway and Turkish customs increase. I began by saying that His Majesty s Government were genuinely anxious to meet the Ottoman Government by assenting to the 4 per cent, customs increase, but they were deterred by the knowledge that any such increase would, either directly or indirectly, facilitate the progress of the Bagdad Railway, an enterprise which, if carried out according to the Convention of 1903, would not in our opinion serve the best interests of Turkey, while it could not fail to inflict enduring injury on the commerco of Great Britain. The upshot _ of the situation was, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government could not give their assent to the customs increase if the Convention of 1903 remained unchanged in force. In support of the view that the Convention of 1903 was not favourable to Turkey, I handed to Djavid Bey the annexed aide-memoire ; in support of the contention that the advent of the Bagdad Railway under German auspices would inflict damage on British trade, I urged that the railway would constitute a virtual monopoly of the means of communication in Mesopotamia, while the concession conferred upon the Germans important subsidiary rights which tended to establish a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country. Djavid Bey concurred in this estimate of the Concession of 1903, both in so far as it affected Turkish and British interests : he said that his wish was to find an equitable solution of these very difficulties, and he frankly admitted that such a solution was not possible unless the Convention of 1903, in so far as it related to the Bagdad-Gulf sections, was fundamentally modified. He then said that he intended to visit Berlin after leaving London, his object being to. induce the Germans to agree to a satisfactory modification; it was true that this might be difficult to bring about, but the Turkish Government had means of retaliation in regard to other German interests in Turkey, and he was not prepared to regard the effort he was about to make at Berlin as foredoomed to failure. What, he said, was important at the moment was that he should ascertain precisely what solution would be accepted by His Majesty’s Government, and before discussing the subject he would emphasise the fact that the Ottoman Government did not wish to have two distinct railways built between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. It appeared to him that there were two alternative modifications which might meet the situation :—either (1) the Turkish Government themselves should construct and subsequently control the railway between Bagdad and the Gulf; or (2) that portion of the Bagdad Railway should be internationalised in such a manner that Turkey would receive 25 per cent., Great Britain 25 per cent., Germany 25 per cent., and France 25 per cent., the president being a Turk. I said that before replying I should like it to be understood that any observations I made must be regarded as tentative, since I obviously had no authority to commit His Majesty’s Government in any way, and the object of my visit was merely to discuss the subject in order, if possible, to discover a basis of negotiation. To me the first alternative named appeared to be the more feasible from the point of view of British interests, while the second was hardly likely to be approved by public opinion in this country as a sufficient quid pro quo for British assent to the customs increase. I would, however, submit the two alternative suggestions which he had made. I then said that, assuming that the first alternative were accepted in principle, I should like to know what it would involve: Would the Ottoman Government permanently control the railway when completed ; would they guarantee that British merchandise should not be subjected to adverse manipulation of rates; would they he able to ensure equality of treatment for goods of British origin on the sections of the railway west of Bagdad; would they give to British railway contractors, e.g., the [2825 tfd—2] B2 builders of locomotives cind other rolling-stock nnd the mnnufucturers of rails and other materials, a fair share of the orders connected with the proposed railway ; if, as would probably be the case, foreign engineers and foremen were employed, would application be made to this country for suitable candidates; if a foreign staff wen * required to work the railway when completed would this country be given equality of treatment with other countries in regard to the posts to be filled ? Djavid Bey replied that it would be the intention of the Ottoman Government permanently to control the railway, and not to let it pass into German hands; in so far as manipulation of rates were concerned, he would be t prepared to guarantee equality of treatment for the goods of all nations. As Minister of Finance he could give a private assurance that if purchases , df rolling-stock, &amp;c., had to be made abroad a percentage of 60 per cent, (the amount I had suggested) would be made in England; but he asked that no formal assurance should be required, as he might possibly place 100 per cent, of the orders in England, but he was anxious that there should be no formal conditions, as if there were every other country in Europe would formulate conditions, and the prospect of the customs increase ever receiving general assent would indeed be remote. He could similarly give a private assurance that British engineers and foremen would be given equality of treatment. I will revert to these aspects of the question at the end of this minute. I then said that, assuming that the points indicated had been satisfactorily arranged, there remained a matter of a somewhat delicate nature which could not be excluded from discussion : I referred to the terminal port of the railway. There appeared to be a consensus of opinion amongst those interested in shipping that the most suitable point for such a port was the harbour of Koweit: there ocean going steamers of large tonnage could enter at all states of the tide, and come along side a quay where passengers and merchandise could without loss of time be transferred to the railway adjoining, and within half an hour of leaving the quay the steamers could be in the open sea. Djavid Bey said that the Deputies from Bagdad and Bussorah were each anxious that the terminus should be made at Bussorah. I said that Bussorah was obviously not suited for the maritime terminus of a great trans-continental railway : situated as it was several miles from the mouth of a river which presented exceptional difficulties of navigation, if it became the terminus it would entail, even in the most favourable conditions of tide and weather, a delay of from 10 to 12 hours in reaching the open sea ; moreover, the tendency of modern steamers was to increase in tonnage, and ultimately the larger vessels would not be able to approach Bussorah at all, even under the most favourable conditions. The consequence of making the terminal port at Bussorah would be that transhipment to smaller vessels would in many cases be necessary. I then said that the selection of Koweit as a terminal port had far more importance than at first sight might appear : the question should not be looked upon merely as of local importance ; it should be regarded from larger aspects. With proper management it might well be that Turkey would become the highway for fast traffic between Great Britain and the Indian Empire, and one of the great trade routes between Europe and the Far East. If this was to be brought about it was obviously imperative that there should be economy of time wherever practicable, and to establish the terminus at Bussorah instead of at Koweit would involve the arbitrary sacrifice of this most essepial consideration. I added that I might mention that the Russian Government had more than once approached His Majesty’s Government in the hope of bringing about a junction of the Russian and Indian railway systems, and that if this were once to take place the direct route between England and India would be by way of Russia, and an enormous volume of trade would be lost to Turkey. This contingency seemed to impress Djavid, and he said that it was clearly to the interest of Turkey to secure this through traffic; and I emphasised to him that if there were a chance of a competing line to India the importance of saving time by making the terminus at Koweit became still more evident. I then said that His Majesty’s Government felt, in view of the great predominance of British trade interests in the Persian Gulf, that it would only be fair that British contractors should build the harbour of Koweit. Djavid replied that if Turkey built the railway she should also, in his opinion, build the terminal port, and he added that the question of Koweit was a political one which he, as Minister of 'Finance, did not feel qualified to discuss. I said that the whole question of the Bagdad Railway was apolitical one, since it would constitute not improbably the quickest route to India, and the question was one in which finance and policy were closely bound up. He begged that the question of this country constructing the terminal port might be left out of consideration ; but I rejoined that if His Majesty’s Government agreed to the 4 per ^ent. and only insisted that Turkey herself, and not Great Britain, should control the &lt; une between^ Bagdad and the Gulf, the least we could expect from the Turkish Government in return for the great concession we were making with regard to the customs increase, would be that Turkey should allow Great Britain to construct and control the port at Koweit: for myself, I felt sure that it would be quite impossible to satisfy British public opinion short of this, and it would be impossible to defend our assent to the customs increase. Djavid said that the question of Koweit was political, and it should not be brought into discussion. I replied that for two hundred years we had had relations of amity with the Sheikh of Koweit, •' a nd^t hat we possessed, as the Turkish Government Were aware, great influence with him//now, recognising that the question of Koweit could not be separated from that of the Bagdad Hallway, we wished to regularise the situation there by coming to an agreement of cordial co-operation with the Turkish Government; and I confessed frankly that 1 saw little hope of the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the 4 per cent, being arranged unless we could come to an agreement that the terminus of the railway should be at Koweit under the conditions explained. In conclusion, I promised Djavid that he should have a written memorandum as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Suggestions. I think that the best mode of procedure is to draw up a statement for Djavid, saying that we are anxious to agree to the 4 per cent, on terms which would be accept able to Turkey, and that we fully appreciate his disinclination to see her consent coupled with conditions, since this might lead to further conditions being made by other Powers. If therefore, when he returns from Berlin, he is able to announce that the German Government have agreed to Turkey building and permanently controlling the line between Bagdad and the Gulf, and if he is able to give us an informal assurance as to the several points indicated on p. 3 (paragraph 2) of this minute, we should be prepared to agree to the 4 per cent, for a period of four years, (till 1914 when the 3 per cent, would come to an end), but that we should expect the terminus to be at Koweit and the port there to be constructed by us, and such foreign control as existed to be British, and that if, at the end of four years, we found that the conditions on the part of Turkey had not been fulfilled, then we should have to withdraw our assent not only from the 4 per cent., but also from the 3 per cent., which has only been agreed to till.1914. I think this is the utmost we can safely do without having conditions in the form of an agreement, such as Djavid objects to. I think the point about Koweit is a most important one; and if we do not have the terminus there we shall also have been spending our money for nothing. A. P. Foreign Office, July 27, 1910. There is the further condition we desire to make about the removal of the restriction on the borrowing powers of Egypt. If the Turks wish this could be done by a firman issued on the day we agree to the customs increase, or by a note to us. -A.. Jr. C. H.

I HAVE the honour to report that work upon the construction of the Bagdad | Railway in this district is progressing very slowly owing to the disputes that have ’ broken out between some of the contractors and the workmen. The former, who had contracted for small sections of embankment work, agreed to pay the ’workmen 15 piastres a-day ; the men have, however, in many cases received only 8 piastres a-day, and that not always regularly. A great many have, therefore, struck work, and, as labour in this district is not too plentiful, operations in some of the sections have come to a temporary stand-still. _ Perhaps it is this state of affairs which has caused the company to ask a British subject, Mr. P. Christian, whose name has been several times [mentioned in former despatches, to take up a contract for 10 kilom. of embankment work.

Memorandum communicated to the Ottoman Minister of Finance, Jidy 29, 1910. HIS Majesty’s Government have given their careful attention to the important considerations laid before them by his Excellency the Minister of Finance on the subject of the proposed increase in the Turkish customs duties from 11 to 15 per cent. ad valorem. They fully appreciate the motives which have determined the Imperial Ottoman Government to approach the Powers with a view to securing assent to this proposal, but unfortunately, as the Ottoman Government are aware, the question is complicated owing to its relation to the Bagdad Railway,—an enterprise which, under the existing concession, has not been conceived in the best interests of the Ottoman Empire, while it offers, as at present controlled, an undoubted menace to the legitimate position of British trade in Mesopotamia, which now rests upon the uninterrupted efforts of well-nigh three hundred years. His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that any increase in the Turkish customs duties under present conditions must, if not directly then indirectly by the mere fact of setting free other revenues, hasten the completion of the Bagdad Railway, with its consequent effects prejudicial to the interests of this country. In view of this conclusion, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was recently instructed to represent to the Ottoman Government that British assent to the increased customs duties must be chiefly dependent upon the satisfactory solution of the Bagdad Railway question, and, as a means of attaining this object, it was suggested either that British participation should be secured on acceptable terms in the portion of the Bagdad Railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, or that the Ottoman Government should grant, along the valley of the River Tigris, a “ protective ” concession for a second railway, which was to be under the cegis of a Turkish company. The latter suggestion did not commend itself to the Ottoman Government; while, as regards the former, no concrete scheme has as yet been brought before His Majesty’s Government, In the course, however, of tentative discussions which have taken place within the past few days, the Ottoman Minister of Finance has put forw r ard two alternative proposals as affording the basis of a possible agreement: the first is an arrangement for internationalisation, the second is for the construction of the line by the Turkish Government ; both proposals are confined to the portion of the railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. With regard to internationalisation, His Majesty’s Government are aware of what has been discussed by Herr Gwinner with Sir Ernest Cassel. In their opinion, a solution might be found on these lines, but to be satisfactory to all parties it should not be financially onerous to the Turkish Government nor prejudicial to the future working and development of traffic on the railway. As His Majesty’s Government understand that the purport of the negotiations between Sir E. Cassel and Herr Gwinner is known to Djavid Bey, they think it right to communicate to him confidentially a copy of the letter to Sir H. Babington- Smith, in which they have already expressed their own view. As for the construction of the line by the Turkish Government, His Majesty’s Government would, under certain safeguards, regard such a solution as satisfactory; but certain questions would arise the settlement of which might present some difficulty. For instance :— Would the Ottoman Government permanently control the railway when completed ; would they guarantee that British merchandise should not be subjected to adverse manipulation of rates ; would they be able to secure equality of treatment for goods of British origin or destination on the sections of the railway west of Bagdad; would they give to British railway contractors a share (proportionate to the volume of British trade in those regions, say 60 per cent.) in the provision of railway material and rolling-stock ; if, as would probably be the case, foreign engineers and foremen are [2825 1]2 employed, and if a foreign staff is required to work the railway when completed, would application he made to this country for suitable candidates, and would this country be given equality of treatment with others in regard to the posts to be filled ? Then His Majesty’s Government, realising the immense importance of the railway as constituting the future highway for fast traffic between this country and the Indian Empire, feel confident that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the necessity of selecting as the terminus of the railway a point best adapted to economy of time. His Majesty’s Government are advised that there is a consensus of opinion amongst those interested in shipping that the most suitable place for a port would be the harbour of Koweit: there ocean-going steamers of large tonnage could enter at all states of the tide and at all seasons of the year and, within a few minutes of leaving the open sea, could come alongside a quay wdiere passengers and merchandise might, without loss of time, be transferred to the railway adjoining. On the other hand, the town of Bussorah is obviously not suited for the maritime terminus of a great trans-continental railway: situated as it is several kilometres from the mouth of a river which presents exceptional difficulties of navigation, especially at times of drought, if it became the terminus it would entail, even in the most favourable conditions of tide and weather, a delay of from ten to twelve hours in reaching the open sea: moreover, the tendency of modern steamers is to increase in tonnage, and ultimately the larger vessels would not be able to approach Bussorah, with the consequence that transhipment to smaller vessels would be necessary. His Majesty’s Government are further of opinion that, in view of the great predominance of British trade interests in the Persian Gulf, it would only be just that British contractors should build the harbour at Koweit; if His Majesty’s Govern ment agreed to the customs increase while merely insisting that Turkey herself, and not Great Britain, should control the line of railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, the least they could expect would be that Turkey should allow Great Britain to construct, and to have a share in the control of the port at Koweit: indeed, short of some arrangement of this nature, it would be quite impossible to satisfy British public opinion and to defend the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the increase of customs. His Majesty’s Government, in making this proposal to the Ottoman Govern ment^ have an earnest desire to co-operate with them in an amicable settlement of a question which, if it remains in suspense, may give rise to much inconvenience in future. There is one further point to which His Majesty’s Government wish to draw attention: their desire that the Ottoman Government should consent to the removal of existing restrictions on the borrowing powers of Egypt: they feel confident that the Ottoman Government will not fail to recognise how reasonable is this request, and to take it into their favourable consideration. From certain observations which his Excellency the Minister of Finance has made, His Majesty s Government are led to conclude that the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment would deprecate the assent of the Powers being made subject to conditions to be embodied in a formal convention : His Majesty’s Government fully realise the importance of this consideration and, with a view to meeting the wishes of the Ottoman Government on the subject, they would suggest that the Ottoman Minister for I oreign Affairs should address to them a note, which if desirable could be regarded as confidential, conveying assurances with regard to the points enumerated in this communication: in such an event, and on learning that the other Powers had notified their assent to the Ottoman Government, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to agiee 1 ^ a n increase of the customs for an initial period of three years, terminating in pril 1914 when the seven years during which the former increase was to continue will come to an end. If, at the expiration of the period in question, the arrangements which have been outlined were being executed in a satisfactory manner, His Majesty’s Government, w o aie keenly interested in the economic prosperity of the Ottoman Empire, would ma e no dimculty m assenting to the continuance of the increased duties (up to 15 per i cent 0 l or a further period, subject to the agreement of the other Powers. Foreign Office, July 29, 1910.im-s [This Docmrrent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. [July 27.] Section 2. [27275 No. 1 . Minute. xi I CALLED on Djavid Bey to-day, and discussed with him the questions of the Bagdad Railway and Turkish customs increase. I began by saying that His Majesty’s Government were genuinely anxious to meet the Ottoman Government by assenting to the 4 per cent, customs increase, but they were deterred by the knowledge that any such increase would, either directly or indirectly, facilitate the progress of the Bagdad Railway, an enterprise which, if carried out according to the Convention of 1903, would not in our opinion serve the best interests of Turkey, while it could not fail to inflict enduring injury on the commerce of Great Britain. The upshot of the situation was, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government could not give their assent to the customs increase if the Convention of 1903 remained unchanged in force. In support of the view that the Convention of 1903 was not favourable to Turkey, I handed to Djavid Bey the annexed aide-memoire ; in support of the contention that the advent of the Bagdad Railway under German auspices would inflict damage on British trade, I urged that the railway would constitute a virtual monopoly of the means of communication in Mesopotamia, while the concession conferred upon the Germans important subsidiary rights which tended to establish a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country. Djavid Bey concurred in this estimate of the Concession of 1903, both in so far as it affected Turkish and British interests : he said that his wish was to find an equitable solution of these very difficulties, and he frankly admitted that such a solution was not possible unless the Convention of 1903, in so far as it related to the Bagdad-Gulf sections, was fundamentally modified. He then said that he intended to visit Berlin after leaving London, his object being to induce the Germans to agree to a satisfactory modification ; it was true that this might be difficult to bring about, but the Turkish Government had means of retaliation in regard to other German interests in Turkey, and he was not prepared to regard the effort he was about to make at Berlin as foredoomed to failure. Wliat, he said, was important at the moment was that he should ascertain precisely what solution would be accepted by His Majesty’s Government, and before discussing the subject he would emphasise the fact that the Ottoman Government did not wish to have two distinct railways built between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. It appeared to him that there were two alternative modifications which might meet the situation :—either (l) the Turkish Government themselves should construct and subsequently control the railway between Bagdad and the Gulf; or t 2) that portion of the Bagdad Railway should be internationalised in such a manner that Turkey would receive 25 per cent., Great Britain 25 per cent., Germany 25 per cent., and France 25 per cent., the president being a Turk. I said that before replying I should like it to be understood that any observations I made must be regarded as tentative, since I obviously had no authority to commit His Majesty’s Government in any way, and the object of my visit was merely to discuss the subject in order, if possible, to discover a basis of negotiation. To me the first alternative named appeared to be the more feasible from the point of view of British interests, while the second was hardly likely to be approved by public opinion m this country as a sufficient c/uzd 'pro cpuo for British assent to the customs increase. I would, however, submit the two alternati\e suggestions which he had made. . I then said that, assuming that the first alternative were accepted m principle, I should like to know what it would involve : Would the Ottoman Government permanently control the railway when completed ; would they guarantee that British merchandise should not be subjected to adverse manipulation of rates ; would they be able to ensure equality of treatment for goods of British origin on the sections of the railway west of Bagdad; would they give to British railway contractors, e.g., the [2825 2] Bbuilders of locomotives and other rolling-stock and the manufacturers of rails and other materials, a fair share of the orders connected with the proposed railway ; if as would probably be the case, foreign engineers and foremen were employed, would application be made to this country for suitable candidates ; if a foreign staff were required to work the railway when completed would this country be given equality of N treatment with other countries in regard to the posts to be filled ? Djavid Bey replied that it would be the intention of the Ottoman Government permanently to control the railway, and not to let it pass into German hands; in so far as manipulation of rates were concerned, he would be prepared to guarantee equality of treatment for the goods of all nations. As Minister of Finance he could give a private assurance that if purchases of rolling-stock, &amp;c., had to be made abroad a percentage of 60 per cent, (the amount I had suggested) would be made in England ; but he asked that no formal assurance should be required, as he might possibly place 100 per cent, of the orders in England, but he was anxious that there should be no formal conditions, as if there were every other country in Europe would formulate conditions, and the prospect of the customs increase ever receiving general assent would indeed be remote. He could similarly give a privat e assurance that British engineers and foremen would be given equality of treatment. I will revert to these aspects of the question at the end of this minute. I then said that, assuming that the points indicated had been satisfactorily arranged, there remained a matter of a somewhat delicate nature which could not be excluded from discussion : I referred to the terminal port of the railway. There appeared to be a consensus of opinion amongst those interested in shipping that the most suitable point for such a port was the harbour of Koweit: there ocean going steamers of large tonnage could enter at all states of the tide, and come along side a quay where passengers and merchandise could without loss of time be transferred to the railway adjoining, and within half an hour of leaving the quay the steamers could be in the open sea. Djavid Bey said that the Deputies from Bagdad and Bussorah were each anxious that the terminus should be made at Bussorah. I said that Bussorah was obviously not suited for the maritime terminus of a (meat trans-continental railway : situated as it was several miles from the mouth of a river which presented exceptional difficulties of navigation, if it became the terminus it would entail, even in the most favourable conditions of tide and weather, a delay of from 10 to 12 hours in reaching the open sea ; moreover, the tendency of modern steamers was to increase in tonnage, and ultimately the larger vessels would not be able to approach Bussorah at all, even under the most favourable conditions. The consequence ° m j . in S terminal port at Bussorah would be that transhipment to smaller vessels would m many cases be necessary. ^ sa i d i that, the selection of Koweit as a terminal port had far more importance an a rst sig t might appear : the question should not be looked upon merely as of oca. importance , it should be regarded from larger aspects. With proper management rt might well be that Turkey would become the highway for fast traffic between Great n am am e Indian Empire, and one of the great trade routes between Europe and n 6 aS ' this was to be brought about it was obviously imperative that there s ou e. economy o time wherever practicable, and to establish the terminus at ussora ms ea o at Koweit would involve the arbitrary sacrifice of this most essemal consideration. I added that I. might mention that the Russian Government had more than once approac e is ajesty s Government in the hope of bringing about a i unction of the Russian and Indian railway systems, and that if this were once to take place the direct rou e e ween ng and and India would be by way of Russia, and an enormous volume of trade would be lost to Turkey. • - r&gt; C m I1 ^! n ^ e ^ C '^ seemed t° impress Djavid, and he said that it was clearly to the es o ur ey o secure this through .traffic ; and I emphasised to him that if there were a c. ance o a competing line to India the importance of saving time by making the terminus at Koweit became still more evident. S * f Si® Majesty s Government felt, in view of the great predominance n is ra e m crests m the Persian Gulf, that it would only be fair that British contractors should build the harbour of Koweit. Djavid replied that if Turkey built the railway she ffiould also, m his opinion, build the terminal port, and he added that tne question of Koweit was a political one which he, as Minister of Finance, did not teel qualified to discuss. I said that the whole question of the Bagdad Railway was a3 political one, since it would constitute not improbably the quickest route to India, and the question was one in which finance and policy were closely bound up. He begged 1 that the question of this country constructing the terminal port might be left out of ^ consideration; but I rejoined that if His Majesty’s Government agreed to the 4 per cent, and only insisted that Turkey herself, and not Great Britain, should control the line between Bagdad and the Gulf, the least we could expect from the Turkish Government in return for the great concession we were making with regard to the customs increase, would be that Turkey should allow Great Britain to construct and control the port at Koweit: for myself, I felt sure that it would be quite impossible to' satisfy British public opinion short of this, and it would be impossible to defend our assent to the customs increase. Djavid said that the question of Koweit was political, and it should not be brought into discussion. I replied that for two hundred years we had had relations of amity with the Sheikh of Koweit,that we possessed, as the Turkish Government were aware, great influence with him, and that we had never denied the existence of Turkish suzerainty over Koweit; now, recognising that the question of Koweit could not be separated from that of the Bagdad Railway, we wished to regularise the situation there by coming to an agreement of cordial co-operation with the Turkish Government; and I confess frankly that I saw little hope of the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the 4 per cent, being arranged unless we could come to an agreement that the terminus of the railway should be at Koweit under the conditions explained. In conclusion, I promised Djavid that he should have a written memorandum as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Suggestions. I think that the best mode of procedure is to draw up a statement for Djavid, saying that we are anxious to agree to the 4 per cent, on terms which would be accept able to Turkey, and that we fully appreciate his disinclination to see her consent coupled with conditions, since this might lead to further conditions being made by other Powers. If therefore, when he returns from Berlin, he is able to announce that the German Government have agreed to Turkey building and permanently controlling the line between Bagdad and the Gulf, and if he is able to give us an informal assurance as to the several points indicated on p. 3 (paragraph 2) of this minute, we should be prepared to agree to the 4 per cent, for a period of four years, (till 1914 when the 3 per cent, would come to an end), but that we should expect the terminus to be at Koweit and the port there to be constructed by us, and such foreign control as existed to be British, and that if, at the end of four years, we found that the conditions on the part of Turkey had not been fulfilled, then we should have to withdraw our assent not only from the 4 per cent., but also from the 3 per cent., which has only been agreed to till 1914. I think this is the utmost we can safely do without having conditions m the lorm o± an agreement, such as Djavid objects to. -i j x v I think the point about Koweit is a most important one ; and if we do not have ; the terminus there we shall also have been spending our money for nothing. A. P. Foreign Office, July 27, 1910. There is the further condition we desire to make about the removal of the restriction on the borrowing powers of Egypt. If the Turks wish this could be done by a firman issued on the day we agree to the customs increase, or by a note to us. ^ ^ C.’ H. * * It will be recalled that we pay 4,000/. a-year to the Sheikh for the lease of land.

Foreign Office, July 26, 1910. fUL 1 urkisli Ambassador and Djavid Bey had some conversation with Sir Charles Hardinge and me to-day, in the course of which we explained how impossible it was for us to grant the 4 per cent, increase of customs dues without some arrangement about the Bagdad Railway. In any case British commerce would object to the increase of the duties, but I should 1)6 piepared to defend the increase if X could prove that the additional revenue would be for the good, of the Turkish Government, and would not be applied to purposes which would injure us. If, however, the additional revenue was devoted, directly or indirectly, to the Bagdad Railway, it would not help the Turkish Government in securing good administration, and it would assist in the creation of a German monopoly of means of transport which would exclude our trade from Mesopotamia. Tiade there .always had a tendency to fall into the hands which controlled the means of communication. Some of these means had for a long time been in British hands, and almost for centuries we had had considerable trade interests in Mesopotamia. If these interests were now to be undermined and eventually replaced by a foreign monopoly, created as a result of our having agreed to the increase of the Turkish customs duties, it was too much to expect that we should agree to the increase. Djavid Bey protested that the 3 per cent, increase of dues, agreed to two years ago, had not injured trade. lie argued that therefore the 4 per cent, increase would not do so either. He went on to say, however, that no decision had yet been taken as to the allocation of revenues for the Bagdad Railway beyond El Halif ; the Germans would be asked to renounce their right to claim the proceeds of the 4 per cent, increase during the next five or six years, and to give up part of the concession beyond Bagdad ; this part of the railway could then be made by the Turks themselves. It was arranged that Djavid Bey should further discuss the details of the railway with Mr. Parker. Djavid Bey also explained to us the desire of the Turkish Government to establish a petroleum monopoly and to impose a “ patent ” tax on foreigners trading in Turkey. We promised to examine these questions. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [2825 cc—1]rm-s [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] BAGDAD KAILWAY. SECRET. [26703] No. 1. [July 23.] Section 1. Sir H. Babington Smith to Sir Edward Grey.—(Bcceived July 23.) Dear Sir Edward Grey, Constantinople, July 19, 1910. MUST apologise for my delay in thanking yon for your letter of the 31st May. I received it on my return to Constantinople, but since then I have been laid up with an attack of fever and have not been able to resume work until a few days ago. Sir Ernest Cassel replied to Dr. Gwinner on the 3rd June in the sense suggested in the course of our conversation at the Foreign Office. I understand that Sir Charles Harclinge saw the letter before it was sent and approved of its terms. Since then I have not heard anything further from Dr. Gwinner, nor, so far as I am aware, has Sir Ernest Cassel. As regards the extent of the British share to be claimed in any future negotiations, I may mention that, when the question was raised before, Dr. Gwinner explicitly stated that there would be no objection on the part of the Bagdad Company to a preponderant British share, but he anticipated objection on the part of the Turks. In their present frame of mind I think it is likely that their objections would be difficult to overcome, and I venture to suggest that, if this should prove to be the case, the point after all is not an essential one. A 50 per cent, interest in one hand would, I believe, as a matter of fact, give absolute control, as against 50 per cent, divided among several interests. It Avould, of course, be essential that the 50 per cent, should remain intact, but I do not think there would be difficulty in devising arrangements to secure this. As regards ports, article 23 of the original concession gives the concessionnaires the right of constructing and managing ports at Bagdad, Bussorah, and the terminus of the Koweit section. Whatever arrangements are agreed upon as regard the line south of Bagdad would no doubt apply also to the ports of Bussorah and Koweit. The point is not mentioned in Dr. Gwinner’s memorandum of the 15th December ; and we will bear it in mind in any future negotiations. With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, may not an inconvenient situation arise if the conditions on which the French and Russian Governments will agree to an arrangement are not ascertained till after the arrangement has been negotiated ? If their conditions were ascertained beforehand, they could be kept in view in the course of the negotiations. Inn vp tvf* H. BABINGTON SMITH. [2825 z—1][This Docmi?ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. ] BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. [July 4.] Section 1, [23954] No. 1 . Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Jidy 4 .) (No. 434. Very Confidential.) Sir, Therapia, June 27, 1910. I HAVE the honour to address you on certain aspects of the present financial situation of the Ottoman Empire. In my despatch No. 262 of the 26th April I commented on the advance shown in Turkish finance by the presentation of a budget, even with a deficit, based on reasonably sound data. Circumstances are tending to shake my opinion. On Saturday last the budget as a whole again came before Parliament, and, whereas just two months ago the deficit was set down at 7 millions, it now appears as £ T. 10,528,000. It was explained that in the upshot this deficit would be reduced to £ T. 5,000,000, because there will ( 1 ) remain doubtless at the end of the year an unexpended balance of £ T. 2,000,000 ; (2) be an increase in revenue, owing to a good harvest, of IJ millions ; (3) be a balance from the last financial year of 2 millions. But these explanations are not convincing. I further hear, on fairly good authority, that the metal with which Mahmoud Shevket secured his successes in Albania was not steel or lead, but gold, and that the extraordinary disbursements necessitated by the campaign will bring the total deficit to something like £ T. 12,000,000. What, I think, is true is that in the event j this total will be considerably diminished by, firstly, an excellent harvest, if prospects are maintained, and, secondly, by improved methods of tax collecting. Competent authorities reckon the gain to be obtained from these two sources at about 1 ^ millions each. The Finance Minister is about to start for Paris to commence negotiations for a loan, but meanwhile the pressure for money is growing acute. The Government has recently disposed of the cover for the current account deposited—as explained in my despatches Nos. 619 and 810 of the 28th September and the 29th November, 1908—in the Ottoman Bank, which offered only 87J, selling it at 89 to the Credit Mobilier of Paris. This caused the shares of the 1908 loan to sink two points, the Credit Mobiher having only a small capital and being quite unable to carry a million of Turkish securities. The Turkish Government, after asking for offers on the local market, found that the Imperial Ottoman Bank were the most economical means for bringing out the money, but were surprised to find this institution unwilling to cash their cheques without any account, and accordingly made a temporary loan of £ T. 350,000 with which to pay salaries, pending the arrival of the proceeds of the sale of the current account deposit. They have since been successful in inducing the Ottoman Bank to allow them to have a current account of 1 million, without depositing cover, paying interest on their drawings at the rate of 6 per cent. A suggestion has been made to me as to French policy which seems not at all improbable. It is that the French financiers will put off Javid Bey in his negotiations with them and will leave him without money till the end of the year, by which time the financial pressure will probably be even more severe than now, and the amount required will be considerably increased. They will thus be able to impose such terms as they like, including the grant of those concessions which they most value.. The first fruits of this plan are regarded as having already matured : the concession for the Soma-Panderma Railway has been confirmed. In my despatch No. 379 of the 14th instant I had to point out the lack of any constructive measures during the last two years. I should have made an exception m favour of the attempt to build irrigation works in Mesopotamia. Although Sir W. Willcocks has found his work considerably impeded, still a sum of money has been actually expended on the task. But with regard to the natui al and rational development of the country, such as might be expected from a libeial and enlightened Government, nothing else has been done, and the struggle for.concessions continues in preciselv the same way, though under more complicated conditions, as m the time of Abdul Hamid. [2825 d—1]2 The only object on which money and attention are lavished is the army. Mahmoud Shevket has told me that he considered that if Turkey only possessed a strong army all internal difficidties would disappear and economic success would ensue, a theory ^ which to Western ideas is like.that of basing the pyramid on its apex. In his speech on introducing the military budget, he said the army should be made lit to meet even one of the Great Powers. His budget, far the largest of all, was the only one which was passed without discussion, and, in fact, he appears to plunge his hand into the public purse exactly as he likes, leaving it to Javid Bey, the Finance Minister, to arrange the account-books afterwards. There are apprehensions in the Council of the Debt, as well as in French circles, which are profoundly interested in Ottoman finance, at the present rate of expenditure, which I cannot but think well founded. It is inconsiderable if a small loan like that of 1908 falls two points, but if the Young Turk Government is forced to go on borrowing at the rate of something like a million a month, the interests of the bondholders become seriously involved. The present budget seems to me to provide for but little capital expenditure, and to be almost entirely of a recurrent nature, and if I am right, then Turkish finance will be a kind of calendar, each year marked by its special loan, until at last some crisis comes. It appears to me that a serious question then arises as to the present guaranteed loans. Necessity knows no laws, and, in the eventuality I contemplate, it seems not improbable that the Turkish Government would be quite as ready to lay hands upon the revenues now ceded as to suspend the payment of interest on any subsequent loans. The effect of the one or the other would be much the same, and I understand that the French, who are so infinitely the most interested party, fully appreciate this possibility. It is natural, then, that they should seek to fortify their predominant but precarious financial position here by every means and every concession which promises to be remunerative. It is difficult to believe that a man of Javid Bey’s intelligence should contemplate the heavy military expenditure without disquietude, but he seems quite powerless in the hands of the military departments, and he must consequently be forced to do what he can to meet their requirements. His journey to France will be mainly occupied in the search for a loan. But, though he has not yet said so, his visit to England, where he has so slight a chance of raising money, will surely be to negotiate for the increase by 4s per cent, of the customs duties. This will help, though it will not be sufficient, to cover the deficit, as it cannot be expected to produce more than 1 |- millions. It is with a feeling of grave reluctance that I have pointed out that the grant of reasonable concessions, and, I must add, the redress of legitimate complaints, is subject to the same difficulties as in the time of the old regime, but the fact remains. And, despite fine words, bargaining remains as much a part of Oriental statesmanship as ever. It thus behoves His Majesty’s Government to be prepared with those conditions which appear to them indispensable adjuncts to their assent to this increase. So far as I understand they are primarily the concession for a railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, or a predominant interest in a Turkish-built line, and an arrangement concerning the borrowing powers of the Egyptian Government. Minor points are: (1) the placing of a part of the loan in London ; (2) the completion of custom-house improvements ; (3) the revision of the sanitary tariff ; and (4) the grant to Messrs. Lynch of the navigation of the Tigris. Jheie are other matters on which it would not be unjust to insist, such as the settlement of the Corpi claim, the concession for oil-fiel 8 s in Mesopotamia, which has been half promised to Mr. D Arcy’s syndicate, the regularisation of sanitary matters, Ac., but I apprehend that the first two matters—the Bagdad-Bussorah Railway and the on owing powers of Egypt are those to which His Majesty’s Government attach by ar the gieatest importance. I think it will prove inevitable that the grant of the increase shall be made, unless we are prepared to encounter a most violent storm of ! 1 ~ ee ln §’ an d opprobrium,, and perhaps even active commercial enmity. I merely recapitu ale the points which are included in the allusions made in your despatch .* ^.d September last in order that, while all may come under discussion wi i Javid Bey, His Majesty’s Government may consider in good time those upon which they are irrevocably resolved.

GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1 . Vice-Consul Rawlins to Consul-General Eyres. (No. 26.) Sir, Adana, July 5, 1910. WITH reference to my various despatches on the subject of the Bagdad Railway construction in this district, I have the honour to transmit some further details with regard to the progress that is being made in the work. An important item is the change that has just been decided on as regards the site of the new Adana railway station. This station, as T have shown in my previous reports, was to have been placed to the north-east of the town between the horse market and the Seihun River. Now the site has been changed, and the station is to be built in the vineyards to the due north of the town, and at about twenty minutes distant from it. The ground here has no specific name, but it is in the vicinity of the so-called Cretan quarter. In this quarter the land lies higher, and this change in site has, therefore, presumably been made with a view to avoiding the possibility of the line and station being washed out by the floods which often take place in the winter, and which were responsible for so much damage last year. Around the present site of the new station the company have bought up about 80 dunums of land at a price varying from 121. to 221. per dunum, and besides the station it is said that stores, large repairing sheds, &amp;c., will be erected. With regard to general work along the line, I hear that already most of the necessary earthworks between Missis and Hamidieh have been finished, and the section Adana-Missis (earthworks only) is also nearing completion. Another section—Chakir Pasha through the vineyards to the new station—is also being worked upon, and a good many culverts and small bridges have been finished. Work is also being pushed on between Yenidje and the hills, but I am informed that little progress has been made in that section. There is a general feeling of discontent among the native farmers and small | land-owners at the high-handed actions of the company, which calmly makes its j earthworks, &amp;c., through people’s property without first making payment. It is said that, whereas in all cases the company pays an extremely low price for the land it buvs, payment is often not made at all, and the owner has to be content with the promise that he will receive his money in the future. Up till now these farmers and others have always grumblingly bowed to the company’s will, as they regard the latter as all-powerful. Now, however, the company have met their match for the first time in the person of Subhi Pasha, a wealthy and influential notable and president of the municipality, some of whose land the company is bent on taking over without his consent. Subhi Pasha, with whom I happened to be talking the other day, was extremely angry about this, and expressed himself in very forcible language on the subject of this forcible taking and using of property without the consent of the owners and sometimes without immediate payment. The Pasha finished by saying that he was going to fight the company to the last over this matter, and would advise [2825 s — 2 ]all who had land which was wanted by the company not to let the latter have it until fnll and complete payment had been made. , , , „ This is interesting in so far as it marks the first stand that has been made locally against the Bagdad Company, for generally nobody dares to do anything against an organisation which, in the minds of the majority of the iurkis . population, is A omnipotent, and has not only the force of a Great Power behind it but also the support of the central Government and the direct encouragement of the vah.

I HAVE the honour to report that construction work on the Bagdad Railway is now being pushed on apace, and there are gangs out at work in and around Yenidje (about half an hour by rail from Adana) and also near the station of Ohakir Pasha at a point where the opening ceremony was held, which was described in my despatch No. 9 of the 2nd May, and where the Bagdad line, after following the Mersina-Adana line from Yenidje, will branch off through the vineyards at the back of the town to come out on the large open fields which border the banks of the Seihun River. Enormous quantities of material continue to arrive from Mersina,. and three or four luggage trains run daily from Mersina to Yenidje and Adana. It is, in fact, hard to remember that the Mersina line is distinct, at present, from the Bagdad Company, since the latter appear to have taken over the former, run their engines and waggons on it, and use it for their owm purposes. Rumour has it that M. Endricks, director of the Mersina line, will, on relinquishing his post in nine months time, become an acth e member of the Bagdad Company and be given some higher post in the administration. The advent of the Bagdad Railway has caused a wild speculation in land, and extravagant buying is being indulged in by persons who think they know exactly where the line will pass, and are awaiting a great rise in property. I Jiavo (&amp;c E.’ C. DONALDSON RAWLINS.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. [26453] Memorandum by Mr. Parker. [July 21.] Section 1, MR. A. J.. BARR1 called on the 18th July, and explained to me in some detail the piesent position respecting the Turkish railway projects in which he is interested. He had been in informal communication with M. Huguenin, of the Anatolian and Bagdad Railwa } 7 Companies, and he had also had various conferences with M. Tardieu at Paris respecting French financial interests. Mr. Barry began by recalling as follows the outlines of the scheme originally put forward:— (1.) A Turkish subject, Youssouf Said Bey, had addressed to the Ottoman Govern ment a request for a concession for a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, passing via Homs, Deir, Bagdad, and Bussorah. This person had entered into an agreement with Mr. Barry not to develop the concession (if he should obtain it) except in accordance with Mr. Barry’s wishes. (2.) In deference to the wishes of the Foreign Office, Mr. Barry had at first allowed the project to remain in suspense in so far as it related to the Bagdad-Gulf section. (3.) With regard to the section from Homs to Bagdad, various proposals for Anglo- French co-operation had been under consideration in the earlier stages, and these had from time to time been brought to the notice of the Foreign Office. Mr. Barry then passed to the present position of affairs. * It appeared that the last loan issued for the Bagdad Railway Company had not been a success, and was largely taken up by the underwriters. This had made the Germans more anxious for French financial aid, and, from the language of M. Huguenin, Mr. Barry was led to conclude that the Bagdad Railway Company (or at any rate German financiers if not German politicians) would be glad to arrange an agreement with the promoters of the Homs-Bagdad project, since it would open the French money market to German railway promoters. Besides, M. Tardieu had been in communication at Paris with the German charge d’affaires, who had promised to say what he could in favour of such an agreement. The agreement in question would provide— (a.) That the French, with British participation up to 40 per cent., would build a line from Homs to Deir on the Euphrates. (b.) That the Germans should divert the trarj of the Bagdad Bailway to the south so that it would pass via Aleppo to Deir, and from Deir, after the junction of the Homs Bailway at that point, the Germans would build the continuation to Bagdad, and the working over this section (Deir to Bagdad) would be international. (c.) The Germans might be induced, in return for a cash payment, to waive their concession from Bagdad to the Gulf to a British syndicate. Mr. Barry, I understood, said that the French would agree to such a scheme, but they would like to have some minor participation in the Bagdad-Gulf section. ~ He said that M. Huguenin, of the Anatolian Railway, would welcome such an arrangement so far as he individually was concerned, but as the Bagdad Railway Company has already begun building the line along the original trace, any decision in the sense of the proposed agreement must be reached speedily before the work of building had proceeded much further. As to the Turks, Mr. Barry argued that they would welcome clause (b) of the proposed agreement on account of the diminution it would bring about in the burdens on the Turkish Exchequer, since the proposed alignment would be much shorter than the existing trace of the Bagdad Railway, and he further argued that the Turkish objections to clause (c) might be overcome if a British syndicate were to negotiate with the Porte, not directly, but through his friend, Youssouf Said Bey, a Turkish subject. Mr. Barry wanted to know how such a settlement would be regarded by the Foreign Office, and whether, if it were brought about, the consent of His Majesty s Government to the 4 per cent, customs increase would be given. [2825 x—l]■ nBKMHMi 2 I said that I would make a memorandum of what he had said and send it in, hut that it would he impossible to give him an answer before he returned to Paris on the 21st July. My own personal criticisms on the propositions were as follows :~ \ p£ points (n) and (h) were to be arranged between the French and Germans without a simultaneous agreement being made as to (c), Franco-German financial co-operation would be brought about and the progress of the Bagdad Railway facilitated, to the direct damage of British interests. . (2.) As to point (c), it did not seem to me to offer a practical solution ; m the first place I did not believe that the Germans would willingly agree to waive their rights on the Gulf section as suggested ; in the second place, it seemed to me precarious to make the permanent interests of the British syndicate m the Gulf section dependent on a contract with Youssouf Said, since such a contract would, I thought, only be enforce able, if at all, in the Turkish courts which were corrupt; in the third place, I believed Rie Turks would at once see through the subterfuge of putting forward T oussouf Said Bey as a figure-head. . (3.) There were other British firms,* besides that of Mr. Barry, interested m the project of a railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty s Government could not give Mr. Barry preferential support. For these reasons I did not think that His^Majesty’s Government would be likely to agree to the customs increase if the proposition of Mr. Barry went through ; more over, it seemed to me doubtful if Youssouf Said Bey would get any concession whatever from the Turks. Mr. Barry admitted the force of (1) and (2). As for (3), he said he would he quite willing to join any other firm approved of by His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Barry called again next day and I read this memorandum over to him, and he said it was a correct record of what had passed between us. Since then, however, he has written the annexed letter :— « p) ear jyjp Parker, “ 2, Queen Anne’s Gate, Westminster, July 20, 1910, “ In thinking over my conversation with you last night, I believe you informed me that you had mentioned in your memorandum that, in your opinion, the agreement entered into by me with Youssouf Said Bey is of little value, as it could only be enforced in the Turkish courts, which courts cannot be trusted to administer impartial justice, and that I agreed with you. I would, however, in order to prevent any misunderstanding, like to point out that, so far as I personally am concerned, I have no means of forming an opinion as to the trustworthiness or otherwise of the Turkish courts, but merely accepted your views on the subject. “ Yours sincerely, “ A.

Sir, Foreign Ofice, July 18, 1910. HERR VON STUMM, lately Councillor of the German Embassy in London and now an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Berlin, paid recently a short visit to this country. In the course of his stay in London he arranged to call on Mr. Parker, of this Office, at his private house, and spoke to him of the relations between Great Britain and Germany. Herr von Stumm criticised with considerable warmth the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the German Government, and, amongst many other expressions of dissatisfaction, complained of their delay in replying to the recent memorandum of the German Chancellor suggesting a method of settling the questions at issue between the two countries. In the light of a reperusal of my recent despatches on this subject, more especially of my despatch Wyour Excellency No. 148 of the 31st May and after reading your despatch No. 194,’^Confidential, of the 3rd July containing an account of your recent interview with Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, I feel that too much importance need not be attached to Herr von Stumm’s complaint.

(No. 191. §i r I HAVE the honour to report that the Imperial Chancellor lefrBerlm^sterday for his summer holiday. At his request I called upon him before his departure and had a short conversation with him on general topics. His Excellency said that with the exception of the ever recurring Cretan question, there appeared to he a g^eval Ml m European politics M. Isvolsky, who, when passing through Berlin, had given it to be understood that he would shortly send an answer to the Gerrnan-Persbm railway proposals of four years ago, had made no sign, nor had His Maiestv’s Government, he added with a smile, showed any particular anxiety to continue thn conversation with Germany on Persian affairs. This was all his Excellency said respecting foreign politics. He then turned to German internal politics and the recent changes m the Prussian Cabinet. He passed lightly over the retirement of the Ministers of the Interior and Agriculture, but expressed the greatest regret at the loss of Herr von Rheinbaben, whose exceptional gifts and great financial experience would be greatly missed. He added, that I had doubtless noticed the reasons given m the press for Herr von Rheinbaben’s retirement, that, for instance he &amp; (the Chancellor) had got rid of him for reasons of jealousy, and that he had fallen into disfavour with the Emperor because he had obstructed His Majesty’s views respectim- the Royal Opera House, or something of the sort. He need hardly tell me that these rumours were both malevolent and untrue. As a matter of fact, he had used every effort to dissuade Herr von Rheinbaben from retiring, and on three separate occasions had begged him to reconsider his decision. The Emperor had also done his best to keep him, and had for some time refused to accept his resignation. His Majesty however, had M last said, “Well! as Herr von Rheinbaben is so set upon having the Coblenz appointment, I suppose we must let him go.” Notices in the sense of the Chancellor’s statements to me have been inserted in several of the semi-official papers, but they are treated with derision by the greater part of the press, who stoutly maintain that Herr von Rheinbaben was dismissed owing to differences of opinion with the Chancellor on many political subjects notably that of electoral reform. As a matter of fact, it would seem as if the Chancellor, while being accused by the Liberals and Radicals of being reactionary in that question, has fallen under the suspicion of the Conservatives and Centre as having a tendency to coquet with the National Liberals, or, at all events, to surround himself with men of no very decided opinions, so as to render himself not absolutely dependent on the goodwill of the Conservative side of the Reichstag. The Chancellor then spoke of Herr von Kdderlen Waechter, and expressed the hope that I would have the same pleasant relations with him as I had had with Herr von Schoen. I said that I should miss the latter very much, as we were friends and colleagues of many years’ standing. I had always found him very friendly and well disposed towards my country, and I hoped that Herr von Kiderlen entertained the same sentiments. The Chancellor replied that Herr von Kiderlen had somehow or other got the reputation of being somewhat brusque and overbearing in his manner. He did not think that this reputation was deserved, and he was sure that I would find him very pleasant to deal with. “ As for his sentiments,” his Excellency added, “ it is I who direct the foreign affairs of the Empire, and as long as I hold my present office those under my orders will have to adopt their sentiments to mine.” The Chancellor said this very stiffly, and his words were almost identical with these which he had used to my Erench colleague a few days before. Personally, I f think that the language held by the press in writing upon Herr von Kiderlen [2825 /—l]BgMhyMjJaHEBHBMggEEgHB Waecliter’s appointment has rather got upon his Excellency s nerves. There is scarcely a newspaper which does not allude to the probability of a more active policy as soon as the conduct of affairs comes into Herr von Kiderlen’s capable and energetic hands, and though some of them speak of the Emperor’s controlling influence, the Chancellor seems to he entirelv left out of their calculations. ^ The “ Berliner Tageblatt,” at the conclusion of an article respecting the Y appointment, writes as follows :— {&lt; How far Herr von Eider!en Waechter will succeed in making his mark is very doubtful. More than ever the deciding word in Imperial affairs rests with the Emperor. The debates of November 1908 have remained a mere episode. Personal regime still holds the field, and is to-day more in evidence than ever.” The Chancellor himself called my attention, somewhat pointedly, to the “ excellence of Herr von Kiderlen’s press.” I have, &amp;c.

I added that I had understood from the conversation I then had with him and the Grand Vizier that he would have some more satisfactory reply to give you than that given to me on that occasion, as he had undertaken to discuss the matter with the Grand Vizier and lay certain proposals before you. His Excellency, however, merely repeated what he had said to you, as recorded in your despatch No. 155, Secret, of the 6 th instant, and added that as Baron Marschall had left on leave of absence he had had no opportunity of speaking to him, and he did not know whether the charge d’affaires would be authorised to discuss the matter with him. In the contrary case, he would instruct the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin to induce the German Government to give up the Bagdad-Gulf section of the concession, and let Turkey make part of the line herself, and in spite of the doubts expressed by you as to the success of the negotiations he was still sanguine. Rifaat Pasha eventually promised to reply in the same manner in which our communication had been made, namely, in a despatch to be addressed to Tewfik Pasha, copy of which would be left with you. I may add that Rifaat Pasha made no allusion to the fact that they were not prepared to froisser the Germans by giving a concession to a British company, but he did say that they would be confronted with great difficulties if they began a bargaining process over the 4 per cent, customs increase, as once it was known that a concession was to be made to us the French would demand another, and other Powers would follow suit.

Lowther to Sir Edicard Grey.—{Received June 27.) (No. 389. Confidential.) Sir, Therapia, June 17, 1910. WITH reference to my despatch. No. 144 of the 8 th March last, I have the honour to report that Mr. A. J. Barry called here two days ago in order to place the embassy in possession of the latest information regarding the Homs-Bagdad Railway negotiations. Mr. Barry had in his pocket a private note from the Foreign Office informing him that the scheme had grounded on the opposition of the Germans ; and his agent here, Mr. Maimon, had also gathered from the Turkish side that, though ready to grant the concession, they could not do so in face of Germany’s objections. Mr. Barry had therefore come to the conclusion that the Anglo-French group, whose interests he and M. Tardieu represent, must set to work to overcome this opposition and endeavour to arrive at a compromise with the German company. M. Huguenin was sounded indirectly, and seemed not averse to coming to some arrangement; his objections to the Bagdad-Homs scheme were that it would compete with the Bagdad line, would take away from its traffic and business, and would unfavourably affect its revenues; it was therefore disadvantageous to the Turks. It must also be remembered that the Bagdad Railway Company in calculating their kilometric guarantees on the line had taken an average of the general expenditure over the whole line, irrespective of the fact that certain portions were far more costly to construct than others. Thus, the portion which the Germans are busy working on now, from Eregli to Adana, contained some 19 miles of tunnelling which was the most difficult and expensive work on the whole line; they could not give up to England the level stretch from the Gulf to Bagdad, and concede to France a rival line from Bagdad to the Levant without requiring some compensation on their own account. Some such compromise as the following might, however, be found acceptable: ■ Germany to continue their section on which she is now engaged, as far as. El Halib or Deir ; the French group to build the portion between.Bagdad and.Deir with a line of their own on to Homs, to join the Damascus Homs line (or possibly the Germans to construct the Deir-Bagdad portion, and give the Anglo-French group running rights over it to Bagdad) ; and the English to buy over the Bagdad-Gulf end from the German company. . M. Huguenin has meanwhile gone to Switzerland on leave, and it is expected that he may go and meet M. Tardieu in Paris and discuss this project; he would endeavour to obtain Mr. Gwynner’s assent, and if anything came of the negotiations the proposals made would be submitted to the various Governments for approval. Mr. Barry has to go to Russia on business now, but his group would be represented m any serious negotiations that might take place at Paris by the E^rl of Ronaldshay. If such a compromise as he proposes were come to, Mr. Barry would have the Anglo-French part of the line run on the Indian or Chinese guaiantee system, which he states works out at 4 | per cent, instead of 7^ per cent., which he makes out the present German figure to be; from the Turkish point of view it would therefore, be advantageous financially ; moreover, it would shorten the whole length of the proposed line and the railway would be placed under the Turkish general supervision with maintenance of Turkey’s sovereign rights. He was to have , seen the Minister of Finance yesterdav and hear his views as to the proposals, which he understands are favourable, but he has not informed me of the result of the interview. In any. case, it was only of a purely tentative nature, as he cannot move m the matter without consulting M. Tardieu. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] [June 27.] Section 2. M. Maimon to Mr. Barry.—(Communicated to Foreign Office, June 27.) My dear Barry, Paris, June 25, 1910. AUBOYNEAU, of the Ottoman Bank, has had a long conference with Tardieu to-day, and the latter has just ’phoned me to say that things seem to go on all right on that side. As far as I have been able to gather, it would seem that the Ottoman Bank people would rather like to see omitted from my programme the section from Aleppo to Deir, so as to oblige the Bagdadbahn to adopt the French section Aleppo-Hama-Homs and the Anglo-French section Homs-Deir, and only continue their Bagdadbahn to Bagdad from this latter place. Tardieu said as much to me this morning. I fear that this would be asking too much, in view of the fact that they are ‘also asked to give up entirely the continuation south of Bagdad in favour of England. I infer that the Ottoman Bank, on coming to terms with us, would undertake not to consent the 20,000,000Z. loan to Turkey until the concession Homs- Bagdad is accorded on the lines of the existing arrangements. If this were really the case, then it would, to my mind, be highly desirable to come to terms with that institution. What a pity you are not here at this moment so as to sound our Government on ail this, for it is evident that we must do absolutely nothing without its hearty approval. Of course you and I are perfectly agreed on that point, and so is Tardieu, I feel sure. But let us not forget that he is simply guided by a desire to act honourably and be “ correct ” ; whereas, in addition to such praiseworthy motives, you and I are actuated by the desire to serve the cause of England. I am off to Locle to-night, Huguenin having accepted the appointment ioi to-morrow, and I propose to continue keeping Sir Edward Grey informed of all that happens, in accordance with what has been agreed between us at Constantinople Herein enclosed you will find copy of Tardieu’s letter of to-day’s date, of which I am also sending a copy to the Foreign Office.

Owing to the difficulties which have attended the raising by the Deutsche Bank of the 108,000,000 fr. of the 2nd series of the 4 per cent. Bagdad Railway loan, recourse is to be had to Vienna for the first time for the raising of a portion, viz., 25 000 000 fr The sum to be raised here is thus comparatively small, but it seems to be &gt; doubtful whether even the 1,000,0001. will be forthcoming, and the whole operation can only be regarded in the light of an experiment. j + i u The raising of the money has, says the “ Neue Freie Presse been undertaken by the Vienna Bankverein, supported by the Anglo Bank, the Escomptegesellschaft, the Landerbank, the Verkehrsbank, the Merkur, the Bohemian Union Bank, and the Zivnostenska Bank. Subscriptions will be invited m the course of the next few weeks. The Ministry of Finance has already given its consent to the emission of the man, which will be the first issued here for the construction of any Turkish railway. The “Neue Freie Presse” is supplied from Berlin with the foUowmg information in regard to the Bagdad Railway. The construction of the extension (840 kilom. long) of the line from Bulgurlu to Aleppo and El Hehf is being energetically earned on.

The Bagdad Railway deprived Russia of the part naturally allotted to ter by nature as the direct link between Europe and Asia.

I DAVE the honour to forward a report on the Bagdad Railway in this vilayet, being information gathered from a tour to Baghtche last February in the company of Mr. Childs, of the firm of Weston and Childs, architects, Constantinople, to whom I am indebted for much technical matter, and from various sources since then. I have, &amp;c. A. MONCK MASON. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Report by Vice-Consul Mason respecting the Bagdad Railway. THE stretches of the Bagdad Railway now open to general traffic in this vilayet are those between Mersina and Adana, Dorak and Yenidje, and Adana and Ma’moure (also called Bulgurlu). The line Dorak—Yenidje—Adana-Ma’moure is that recently officially inaugurated in the presence of the Minister of Public Works. The division Yenidje-Adana forms part of the Mersina-Tarsus-Adana Railway; it is a strip of little importance from a traffic point of view, as it merely joins Yenidje to the foot of the Taurus Mountains. On the other hand, the Adana-Ma’moure line runs through some 75 miles of rich cotton and cereal country, where the roads are execrable. Here the new railway cannot fail to prove a great factor in the opening up to commerce of the Adana plain, which is now traversed from end to end by the Bagdad Railroad. The station of Ma’moure (the village itself lies at some miles’ distance in the hills) is situated at the furthest north-east limit of the plain; from this point it will climb to Baghtche, rising 1,500 feet in about 28 miles, where a two small and one long (5 kilom.) tunnel are to pierce the Arslanli Bel. As regards the general construction of the newly opened lines, it is obvious that no expense has been spared, though the engineers have not, in every case, found themselves able to cope with the natural difficulties of the country they have to deal with. Thus, although the bridges over the Sihun at Adana and over the Pyramus at Missis are justly admired as masterpieces of bridge construction, and although the rail is laid with steel sleepers throughout and is exceptionally heavy, the engineers would not seem to have taken sufficiently into account the force of the floods which are a regular feature of the winter months in this vilayet. Between Adana and Missis I noticed in February last that in no less than four cases—there were doubtless more— culverts and waterways had been completely washed out by recent rains ; either the culverts had been made too narrow or too wide and inadequately supported. In this connection I may point out that parts of the Mersina-Adana Railway are at much too low a level, as is evidenced by the fact that the line frequently became impassable to traffic during the rain} T season. [2511 fc-2] /. ' . | 21 JUN1912 ' j 2^' ; {secretary's N2 2 6 jThe two larger tunnels also appear to be giving the. engineers pause, especially that through the Taurus at Bozanti. Reliable information is scarce, bnt I have it from a good source that the site of this tunnel has not yet been definitely decided upon; it is variously estimated that from three to five years will see the work completed; the latter figure is the more likely to be correct. As to the Arslanli B(| tunnel, the German delegate at Baghtche, Herr Anders (now r acting vice-consul at Adana), told me that excavation was going on at the rate of 2 metres a-day on each working face, but, as during my short day’s stay at Baghtche he avoided showing Mr. Childs or myself the work in progress, I venture to doubt his statement. The boring of the two smaller tunnels between Baghtche and the Amauns is also progressing, though not very speedily. Buildings at the new station, which lies nearly a mile to the north of the old and quite outside of the town, are about one-third completed. At Yenidje, Zeitounli, and Chakir-Pacha, on the Mersina-Adana line, they may be said to be ready. In the stations east of Adana work is not far advanced, though even at Baghtche, more than 20 miles beyond the present railhead, some few buildings are going up. Between Ma’moure and Baghtche the greater part of the embankment is finished, though in the valley of the Baghtche there is one large gap of about 2 miles, and at one point there will be necessary a difficult piece of bridging some 100 yards long over the bed of the stream. At present it must be said that the work is going forward very slowly. In the Taurus this state of things cannot be helped, as progress can only be made during the summer and autumn. Moreover, prices are rising, and with them the labour bill, which even in the beginning was very considerably underestimated. There are rumours that the finances of the railway are at a low ebb, but I see no particular reason to believe it. Be that as it may, the company has recently raised both the passenger and the freight charges on the Adana-Mersina Railway by about 30 per cent.IZMi I)QCnine _ nt is ^ ne Property of Eis Britannic Majesty’s Govemmenll ASIATIC . * * &lt;l1 TURKEY AND ARABIA.

Section 5. [22401] No. 1. Extract from the “Daily TelegrapJP’ of May 25, 1912 Bagdad Railway : German Activity. General Review. (By Perceval Landon.) MATTERS have at last come to a crisis in the vexed problem of the Bagdad Railway.. The presence of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein as German Ambassador in London is admittedly connected with the immediate need of some international agreement.. The exact price which the two countries will agree to pay for a mutual understanding—which will, of course, embrace other points at issue besides this trans continental line—remains still uncertain. The high contracting parties themselves have probably formed no very clear idea of the shape that the accord will ultimately take. But it is as well that a clear idea should be formed of the present state of the forwardness of the German enterprise and of the probable effect of the completed scheme upon British interests. Unless the whole facts are known, it is quite likely that the importance of an understanding with Germany in this matter may be underrated by the English public. If that be the case, it is probable that no small amount of criticism will be heard of the terms of the new bargain about to be concluded by the Foreign Office. The Bagdad Railway was first mooted shortly after the visit of the German Emperor to Constantinople and Syria in 1898. Not to wearv the reader with aspects of the matter which are no longer of cardinal importance, it may roughly be said that the concessions obtained from the Turkish Government in P)03, 1908, and 1911 contemplate the extension of the Anatolian Railway already existing at the earliest of these dates. This line extended from Haidar Pasha, a port on the Bosphorus immediately facing Constantinople, through Afium Hissar to Konia, the ancient Seljuk capital of Anatolia. From Konia the Bagdad Railway proper may be said to begin. A clause was included definitely granting to the concessionnaires the right to extend the line from Bagdad to a point upon the Persian Gulf. The point itself was not named. _ This concession was made to a company which, though officially Turkish, was in reality a German enterprise from the outset. The line was to be constructed and managed by a German company.. On her side Turkey undertakes to protect the line— a matter which is of some little importance at the present moment. In return for the services thus rendered by the German company, Turkey agreed to pay the famous kilometric guarantee which figures so largely in&gt;11 discussions about this railway. It may be as well to have the exact terms of this guarantee :— “ Le Gouvernement Imperial garantit au concessionnaire par kilometre construit et exploite.une annuite de 11,000 fr., ainsi qu’une somme forfaitaire de 4,500 fr. parannee et par kilometre exploite pour frais dexploitation.” This means that under any circumstances a sum of 11,000 fr. will be paid by the Turkish Government annually for each kilometre of the line over which the Germans are actually running trains. In addition to this, Turkey agrees to pay a contingent sum, not amounting to more than 4,500 fr. a-year, in order, when necessary, to make up the gross receipts of each kilometre to the sum of 4,500 fr. a-year. The terms seem generous. It is to be noted that a newly sanctioned section of the railway connecting the port of Alexandretta with the main line near Kalakeui is to be constructed by the Germans without any guarantee from the Turkish Government at all. This, too, will be seen to be a matter of some importance. [2485 bb—5] SECRETARY’S N9 2 6 21 JUN 1912Progress of the Line. The Germans pushed on the railway from Konia through Eregli to Bulgurlu, where for several years the railhead of the line has remained. It is a compaiatively small stretch of rails, and it runs through a fertile and well-populated country/ presenting no great engineering difficulties. But beyond Bulgurlu the German engineers were faced by nothing less than the gigantic bulk of the Taurus IVtountams, and all construction work came to an end for a long time. Through this range there is, and always has been, only one feasible pass—the famous Cilician Gates. Through these gates the armies of every conqueror have passed and repassed between Asia Minor and Asia Major, and the Germans, in their turn, have found it impossible to adopt any other route. But the difficulties to be encountered are gigantic. The work will require scores of tunnels through particularly obstinate and close-grained rock and viaducts across yawning ravines. Afterwards the line descends to Adana, joining the existing little railway between Mersina and Adana, and extending it to the east to the junction to which reference has just been made. From Kalakeui—Osmanieh is the usual name for the place, though the town of Osmanieh lies 10 miles to the east—one line will proceed due south to Alexandretta, or, as it is locally known, Iskanderun. To this important branch I shall make a reference later. The main line, soon turning south itself and still traversing very difficult country— at one point, between Bagche and Islahie, there is a tunnel 5,500 metres in length— reaches a place called Muslimieh. From this point the trains will run south into Aleppo, the main constructional centre of the entire line, where a very large station and railway works are already in process of construction. The through trains for Bagdad will return as far as Muslimieh, and thence run north-east to Jerablus, on the Euphrates, a place to which the excavations of Mr. D. G. Hogarth have drawn a good deal of attention of late. Here the real desert journey begins, and the difficulties of the line, except for one or two large bridges, from the engineer’s point of view, cease. But from this point political trouble begins. The course adopted runs eastward, and soon reaches Kurdish territory. These descendants of the ancient Medes have never been properly subdued either by the Turks or by the Persians. They maintain an imperium in imperio in the heart of the Turkish Empire, and their objection to railways, which is almost as obstinate as that of John Buskin, should perhaps have been taken into consideration before the course of the line was finally decided upon. The Kurds near Mosul—the eastern objective of this section of the railway—have announced their intention of preventing by force the construction of any railway through their country. The Bagdad Bailway Company has appealed to Constantinople for protection. This the Ottoman Government has been unwilling and probably unable to afford, as its military forces are urgently needed in other directions, and the last thing it wishes is to provoke a Kurdish rising against itself at this moment. The company then requested that Nazim Pasha, the strong ex-Vali of Bagdad, should be given special powers to secure the protection of the work. It is not impossible that this may ultimately be done, but, if so, it will take place in the teeth of the strongest opposition from Shevket Pasha, who at present is practically dictator of Ottoman policy, and whose anger Nazim Pasha incurred by some drastic street improvements in Bagdad which threatened the property of Shevket Pasha’s brother. The Mosul-Bagdad section of the line will be an easy matter from an engineering point of view. The right bank of the Tigris is followed without interruption. Solid Construction begun. Now it is not generally known in England that the surveys of the entire line from Bulgurlu to Bagdad have now been completed, and that the actual work of construction is being carried on at several points in the north-western part of its course. I had the opportunity the other day of going over the railway works at Aleppo, and I was very much impressed by the solidity and importance of the work there done by the Germans. This is no mere light railway, nor is it being made on the principle adopted by the engineers of the Trans-Siberian Bailway. The latter, anxious at all costs to have rail way communication with the Far East at the earliest possible moment, were content, so to speak, to “ tack together ” the new line in the first instance, with the knowledge that they would soon afterwards be obliged to go over the entire work in a more permanent manner. The Germans have decided to carry out the construction in a solid and busmess-hke way from the beginning. To those who know the kind of material usually employed for these pioneer railways, it will be enough to say that- the Londonand North-Western Eailway itself might be glad to use the rails and points which are being laid down between Aleppo and Muslimieh. At the present moment the Adana section and the line from Aleppo to the north beyond Muslimieh as far as Akhterin are actually in working order, it is expected that the line will be complete from Akhterin to the Zorma-Ara Bridge at Jerablus by October next. The new line between Alex- andretta and Osmanieh, for which permission was only granted on 16th February last year, will be finished on 1st April, 1913. This branch line is ol considerable importance to the company. In the first place, the linking up of Alexandretta with the main line east of Adana will enable the engineers to collect the labour and material for the Mesopotamian stretch with very much greater ease. Secondly—and this is a matter of the first importance, which was pointed out to me by a resident in Northern Syria, who was considerably interested in the matter- the facts are that this branch line is a direct communication between Mesopotamia and the nearest and best European seaport, and that no tariff conditions attach to this unguaranteed enterprise. Thus the company will be able, if it wishes to do so, to differentiate the tariffs respectively imposed by' it, so as largely to transfer any general profit earned by the whole line from the guaranteed section to their own ! An important Point. In this connection it is important to remember the tariff laid down by the conces sions. By this the rate, to be charged for the transport of cereals—which, of course, will be by .far the most important freight—is at the rate of 22 paras per ton per kilom. But there is a significant clause, providing that cereals carried in trucks for a distance of not less than 900 kilom. shall pay a special rate of only 6 paras per ton per kilom. Put. into plain English, this means that any grain taken to Alexandretta from the fertile districts.of Mesopotamia—the 900th kilom. is reached about where the Biver Zab falls into the Tigris above Tekrit—will only have to pay about 25s. per ton for the whole journey. In view of the intention of the Turkish Government—and if it is not now the purpose of the Turkish Government it wifi shortly be to the interest of the German Company-—to develop Sir William Willcocks’s schemes, and make of Mesopo- tamia a fertile.grain-producing country, it is as well to remember that grain carried by this railway will not have to pay Suez Canal dues. We all know that it is an axiom of economists, that railway-borne freight-rates cannot compete with ship-born freight- rates. This is an argument which has been so repeatedly used to minimise the import ance of the Bagdad Bail way that it is as well to bear in mind the special circumstances of marine competition in this case. Moreover, under the concession there is nothing whatever to prevent the Germans reducing the rate still further. They do not need for this purpose to obtain the per mission of the Turkish Government: it is only necessary for them to give three days’ notice of such a reduction, and the thing is done. Should the company, in order to prevent sea competition, think it advisable that American precedents should be followed, the main line might be thrown open for the almost gratuitous transport of grain. There is always the kilometric guarantee to persuade them to this course, for though this reduction may be brought about at the discretion of the concessionnaires, without the assent of Turkey, the latter is still obliged to make good the 4,500 fr. per kilometre supplement. What, it may be asked, is the consideration which has induced Turkey to sign so one-sided an agreement? We have seen that she is bound to pay a sum, which is capitalised at 269,110 fr. for each kilometre, constructed and in operation. She is, moreover, bound to make up any deficiency in the annual receipts to the sum of 4,500 fr. a-year. In return for this she receives, on paper, all sums received per kilo metre between 4,500 fr. and 10,000 fr. Above 10,000 fr., 60 per cent, go to the Govern ment and 40 per cent, to the company. It would be difficult to draft a concession which held out more inducements to the concessionnaires to minimise the receipts upon the guaranteed main line, and increase them upon their own short, unguaranteed railway, for which they have a right to charge what they please. The company has not been slow to realise the advantages of its position. Alexandretta, which, even as it exists to-day, is the best harbour on the Syrian coast, is being transformed by the construction of a breakwater 2 kilom. long, and enormous quays which are to be. fitted with every modern apparatus for handling grain. At Haidar Pasha, opposite Constantinople, the company possesses valuable privileges regarding the handling of freight, but the company clearly intends to make Alexandretta the chief port. Naturally enough.Extensions and Branches. There remain for consideration certain other extensions of the main line which require a passing notice. Dismissing as of small importance proposed branches to Marash and Aintal, to the north of Aleppo, an important feeder of the line runs down from Kharput, through Diarbekr and Mardin, to El Helif. This line, which taps a rich and important territory, largely inhabited by industrious Armenians, will sooner or later be extended northwards to meet what is erroneously called the “.French ” railway running up from Samsun, on the Black Sea, to Sivas. The construction of these rails will afford Russia the best steam accommodation with southern Asiatic waters, at least, until the new Trans-Persian line has been constructed. From Mosul a line will be thrown out towards Erbil, if Russian consent can be obtained. It will be remembered that the construction of these branch lines directed towards the Russian sphere of influence in Persia was a matter of special discussion during the “ Potsdam ” discussions of last year. We shall have to wait to see what the actual form of the agreement between Germany and Russia has now taken. A proposed line from El Baj, on the Tigris, to Hit, on the Euphrates, is talked of, as also is a branch in the same district to the east of the main line linking up Khurmatli with Sadiyeh. The latter is of no importance. The former may suddenly spring into prominence if the petroleum of Hit is properly developed. But beyond all question, the most important extensions of the Bagdad line are those wFich are to link it respectively with the Russian railways in Persia, on the one hand, and on the other with the waters of the Persian Gulf. Of these, mention must be made in a separate article.&amp; [This Document is the Property of His Bri tannic Majesty’s —, ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [25548] No. 1. Sir G.

Hugenin, the director-general of the Anatolian and Bagdad Railways, no attempt has yet been made to enter into serious negotiations relative to the construction of the new customs premises and warehouses at Bagdad. The railway company have arranged to prepare plans of the proposed buildings, and, until these have been submitted to and examined by the administration, no further steps are likely to be taken for the present. 1 It is not possible therefore, at the present moment, to define the basis on which negotiations will take place ; 1 understand, however, that the customs are disposed to agree to hand over all the warehousing of goods—goods for local consumption as well as those in transit—to the railway company, in accordance with the stipulations of articles 23 and 24 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, but on the condition— 1. That goods intended for Bagdad are transponed across the river to the town side by the railway company free of charge. 2. That goods shall enjoy free warehousing for the first eight days after landing and storing. 3. That storage dues shall only be levied after that period. 4. That the “ ardieh,” or progressive warehousing charge levied in customs depots, shall be abolished as far as Bagdad is concerned. The railway company apparently claim their right under article 24 of the convention, to erect and maintain bonded warehouses on any section of the railway ; the question seems to be a debatable one, and turns on the interpretation of the Turkish text of the article. This matter will be gone into, as well as the question of the building of the new customs offices, the expense of which will presumably be borne by the administration.

In regard thereto, I am to point out that in Sir R.

Lowther’s despatch if the negotiations now in progress between the Turkish Customs administration and the Bagdad Company are on the basis indicated in the above quotation from Sir R. Crawford’s letter, and I am to suggest, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that an immediate enquiry might be addressed to Sir G. Lowther on this point. The Board, as they have already indicated in their letter of the 11th January last, would have much preferred that the construction and exploitation of the bonded warehouses at Bagdad should have been left to the joint action of the Bagdad companies and of the companies which may hereafter operate the line to be constructed between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf.

Crawford, informing me that all possible measures have been taken for the temporary relief of the exist ing situation at Bagdad, but that they have been un availing to meet the congestion, and that there is now no alternative but to proceed without further delay with the construction of new depots. Negotiations are now in progress for the erection of the new Customs buildings on a site situated in convenient proximity to that selected for the railway station and port to be built by the Bagdad Railway Company. It appears that there has been some friction between the Vail of Bagdad and the Company relative he Right Honourable 10 Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P.to the choice of a site for the future terminus of the railway. The Vali insisted, upon the station and port being built on the left bank i.s. the town side of the river, whilst the railway engineers v/ere of opinion that the right bunk offered the best advantages for the full development of what will become an important railway centre. The views of the Railway Company and their engineers have now been adopted both by the Public Works Department and the Ministry of War; all the plans have been made and approved of by the De partment, and the Customs' Administration are now in a position to consider the measures which must be taken to put an end to the disorder which reigns at the Bagdad Customs and to relieve the congestion caused by the accumulation of goods intended for transit. In the negotiations for the erection of the Customs' premises, near the railway terainus on the right bank of the river, which are now proceeding between the Customs and the Railway Company, I understand the iU' Customs are anxious to ensure/the removal of the Customs' premises to the other side of the river and therefore© SSB&amp;B therefore away from the town and its business quarter v/ili not alter the present conditions of clearance of goods from the Customs into the town, or expose mer chants to expenses not entailed so far; endeavours are consequently being made in the negotiations to secure the easy transport by the railway Company of goods from the right bank to the town on the oppo- site side free of all charges. Should this point be satisfactorily settled, an agreement may be expected very shortly. I have &amp;c..

Steps have already been taken to increase the number of the employes in the Custom House, but. the re ports in the hands of the administration indicate that no real improvement can be effected until additional warehousing accommodation can be provided.

I have to point out the admission of Russia to a share in that section would not constitute a concession on the part of Germany, since that Power has renounced its rights over the section in return for ample compensation ; neither could Germany, for the same reason, claim to receive a share in the Trans-Persian Railway on account of Russian participation in the Gulf section of the Bagdad line.

I said that I knew nothing whatever with regard to Turkish counter-proposals, and was only curious to know what his Excellency thought of the above idea. M.

He was inclined to think that it would be a mistake to accept it, as it would deprive Triple Entente of the predominant control of the Gulf section. It would therefore, in his opinion, be preferable that Russia should participate. The only argument in its favour was that if Russia were excluded from Gulf section Germany might be excluded from Trans-Persian Railway.

FROM information which has reached me recently from His Majesty’s consul- general at Bagdad, I gather that the Germans in that city are somewhat divided in their views as to the arrangements made for the transport thither of material, &amp;c., for constructive work on the Bagdad Railway. On the one hand, Meissner Pasha seems anxious to obtain the cheapest and most efficient transport available, while M. Endruchs, the local representative of the Deutsche Bank, is endeavouring to attain the end in view solely by increasing the number of Turkish steamers, in the ultimate hope of bringing the Turkish administration under German influence or control. Lynch’s agent at Bagdad was in hopes of forming a special separate flotilla, for the carriage of material, to be owned partly by the Turks, partly by Messrs. Lynch, and, perhaps, also partly by the railway company, the present fleets of the former remaining independent as before ; but there seems great doubt as to whether such a combination could ever be established. The Deutsche Bank are evidently anxious to come to some arrangement with the Turkish administration, while the Turkish Government are, as far as I have been able to ascertain, altogether opposed to any arrangement being made with Messrs. Lynch for the carriage of the railway material. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. [2403 s—1][This Boonment is th6 Property of His Britannic Majesty’s GovcmniGiit.J ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

[February 7.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [5390J No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received February 7.) % (No. 103.) Sir, Pera, February 2, 1912. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of the despatch No. 20 of the 18th in stan t, in which you were so good as to forward to me copy of a letter from the Board of Trade containing observations on some of the points raised in my despatch No. 922 of the 13th December last on the question of the results to our interests of a change of the trace of the Bagdad Railway between Mosul and Bagdad, bringing Khanikin on to the trunk line. The application of the German company for this alteration having been rejected by the Turkish Government these questions become of rather academic interest, but I desire nevertheless to offer a few observations on the Board’s letter. The Board were of opinion that the suggested change would not be detrimental to British interests because, among other reasons, if the Bagdad-Khanikin section were built before the remainder of the line, British trade from the south would naturally be benefited. This is, of course, perfectly true, but it does not state the whole case. British trade would not be benefited any more than that of any other country—than that of Germany, for instance, and German trade would have the additional advantage of being carried by a German-managed railway, one of whose cardinal principles is to further German interests in every possible manner. I am quite aware that German transit trade to Persia is at present insignificant as compared with our own ; but we have to look to the future, and to the probability that Germany, with its subsidised line of steamers to the Persian Gulf and its railway in Turkey and interest in the future railways system in Northern Persia, will at no distant date make a great effort to capture the markets of those regions. The Germans, to use a homely phrase, play a very close game, and we cannot afford to give away any points. I regret that the Board of Trade should have been led to think that I am under a misapprehension as to its views with regard to the possibility of discrimination, against British goods on the German lines. My appreciation of their views has been chiefly formed from their letter to your department of the 7th April last, from which I gathered that they believed that such discrimination, at all events in the matter of tariffs, could be fairly effectively guarded against by a written agreement, and I merely meant in my despatch No. 922 above mentioned to convey that my knowledge of German railway management m this country did not allow me to place an equal amount of faith in the efficacy of such safeguards. The Board of Trade go on to say that they fail to see how the risk of discrimination would be increased, so far as the Bagdad-Khanikin route is concerned, if that route were served by a main line instead of a branch line. This point is, I may observe, answered by anticipation by the concluding sentences of the first paragraph of my despatch No. 922, where I drew attention to the possibility of a direct line from Bagdad to Khanikin being built by the contemplated international company which is to undertake the Gulf-Bagdad section, an arrangement which would give us complete security for the transport of our merchandise from the Gulf to the Persian frontier. It is obvious that if the Germans had succeeded in obtaining the alteration of the trace this possibility would have disappeared. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

Crawford is now being printed, and copies will be obtained as soon as they are available. Bagdad Customs and Bonded Warehouses .—By a long-established custom sanctioned by the authorities, the breaking up of bales and cases of merchandise which arrive at Bagdad in transit for Persia takes place within the precincts of the Customs premises. _ The operations of breaking such bales and cases and converting them into packages of dimensions and weights suitable for animal transport takes place under Customs supervision, and merchants are further allowed to store such merchandise in certain rooms—for which a rent is charged—inside the Customs buildings until transport is available and the goods can be cleared for transit. It has long been recognised that the accommodation at the Bagdad Customs for the warehousing of goods, whether for the local trade or for transit, is very limited, and demands have frequently been made by local merchants for an increase of covered space. The unsatisfactory state of the custom-houses at several ports—Bagdad included—was so far admitted by the Turkish Government that engagements were taken by the Porte in 1907, on the conclusion of the agreement, for the increase of the import duty from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, for the rebuilding or enlarging of the custom-house premises at those ports. These engagements are being steadily carried out by the Customs Department; improvements in some of the ports have already been effected, whilst the work to be undertaken in others is being duly considered. A considerable amount of correspondence has been exchanged between the civil and customs authorities at Bagdad and the Central Administration in Constantinople on the subject of the new premises to be put up at Bagdad, and, although a good deal of trouble has been taken, the administration has been unable to come to a decision in the matter, owing to the fact that the area occupied by the present buildings cannot be extended, and that no suitable site within the limits of the city, and having direct access to the river, has so far been found. In conversation recently with Sir R. Crawford on the subject I learnt that the customs authorities are much concerned about the present state of confusion which reigns at the Bagdad Customs, and which has been caused principally by the accumulation of goods destined for Persia. The disturbed state of the country over the Persian border has practically brought about a complete suspension of traffic between Bagdad and Kermanshah. Goods for transit to Persia are lying in the stores of the [2403 d—5]V' vi ' ' ¥ Bagdad Customs, and the continual arr * v ^ ° f “^“^gf^stoms^ffirer) 8 has ^een encumbered the custom-house space that Bash ( oi+nation 41thoup-h obliged to devise some tern™ means^or^ ^The cen^ oZe! contrary to the regulations, is arriving in transit in depdts situated outside authorised the temporary gf S the town. These dep6ts are hired the customs boundary and in various parts oi ti (• t - i bv merchants and are necessarily under Customs control, but this exceptional meagre has thrown an extra amount of work on the customs officials, and they also incur responsibilities which the administration has every interest to see them rel ’ e Recent advices received from Bagdad show that the available storage room in the town is small, and all has been secured; much more is wanted and, although t e local agency of the Imperial Ottoman Bank is quite willing to erect temporary stoies, no suitable site can be found within the town for putting up such buildings. The administration has been brought by a series of circumstances to face the difficult problem of reorganisation and construction at Bagdad, and this is now rendered more difficult of solution by the fact that the Bagdad Railway Company are taking in hand the work of construction of the line from Bagdad northwards, and besides have in view the construction of the port. . j i u The new Customs buildings should be constructed close to the port and also be within easy reach of the railway terminus, and it is quite obvious that the Customs administration can take no steps until the railway company have fixed the site of the terminus and decided the position of the future port on the river. Even w en t lese two points are settled, the question of the storage of goods has also to be solved as the railway company not only have the right to construct the port of Bagdad, but by articles 23 and 24 of the convention of the 5th March, 1903, also have the right to build warehouses for the storage of goods. . In view of these considerations and of the urgent necessity for coming to a prompt decision in order to place the customs service at Bagdad on a proper footing, the administration, rather than undertake the carrying out. of an expensive scheme of construction, which will very probably involve an expenditure of some £T. 130,000, would seem more inclined to arrive at some arrangement with the railway company. Negotiations have not, I understand, actually taken place; the administration has limited its action to making enquiries of the railway company as to the intentions of the company with regard to the port, railway terminus, and the stoies, and the sites which those works are to occupy. Enquiries have also been made as to whether the railway companv would be prepared to entertain proposals for the building .of the new custom house, and I understand the company are favourably disposed to discuss matters with the administration and to make suitable arrangements. Matters appear to have reached this stage, and it is feared that, should further congestion take place in the Bagdad Customs, the administration will have no alternative but to come to terms with the railway company. In the concluding paragraph of their letter of the 10 th ultimo the Board of Trade express the view that it appears premature to make any arrangements for the. con struction of the custom-house and bonded stores by the railway company until the company which will work the lines from Bagdad to Bussorah has been formed, ana, further, that, as the lines north and south of Bagdad will be under different companies, it would be preferable that the construction of the customs buildings should be the joint undertaking of the two companies rather than that of the Bagdad Railway Company alone. The actual position of affairs at Bagdad is, however, such that it cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely ; some line of action must be adopted, and the hands of the administration may be forced at any time to come to some arrangement with the Bagdad Company. Although the Bagdad Railway Company have given up their concession for the construction and working of the Bagdad-Bussorah section, they still retain the exclusive right to build the port of Bagdad and to put up warehouses for the storage of goods, and it is conceivable that some arrangement for the erection and working of these and similar stores conjointly with the new company that is to construct the Bagdad-Bussorah section might be come to were this company already formed. The subject of participation in the building of the port and warehouses might possibly be considered in the forthcoming discussions relative to the Bussorah section.

As the Turkish Government were now engaged in discussions with us as to the Bagdad Gulf sections, they did not desire German intervention m these discussions, and they trusted we should not open the question with Germany, as the latter Power would only be too.glad to re-enter into the enterprise, or demand from Turkey some fresh concessions in return for her abstention. Sir A. Nicolson said that we were awaiting the Turkish reply to our memorandum of July 1911, and that he was not aware of any intention to admit Germany into the discussions between His Majesty’s Government and the Turkish Government] The Ambassador reiterated the view that, beyond contributing perhaps a certain share of the capital, Germany had no further interest in the Gulf sections.

CONFIDENTIAL. o [50743] No. 1. Sir B. Crawford to Mr. Tyrrell.—(Received December 18.) My dear Tyrrell, December 9, 1911. SOME weeks ago I received a letter from tire Minister of Finance as follows Le Gouvernement Imperial, appreciant les services eminents qne vous avez rendus depnis votre entree an Service de 1’Administration des Douanes, est desireux de pronter de vos connaissances et de votre experience sur les questions economiques et nnancieres. , “ 11 a ete convenu officieusement, a cet elfet, de vous attribuer le litre de ‘ Conseiller economique et financier du Gouveruement ottoman,’ tout en vous conservant vos fonctions actuelles.

Je vous prie, cher Mr. Crawford, de me faire connaitre confidentiellement votre opinion sur ce qui precede, et d’agreer, &amp;c. Naib.” I sbov ed tbis letter to tbe Ambassador, and after talking tbe matter over with him I thought it desirable to give an affirmative answer. I am expecting to receive shortly the Imperial irade confirming this new appointment. I have stipulated that the control of the customs shall remain in my hands. The reorganisation of the customs is now so far advanced that the general routine is established and working fairly well on the new system. The reformation of the staff is also well on the way. I have drawn up and issued in French and Turkish a handbook of regulations and instructions for all ordinary customs formalities, and I have trained an efficient corps of inspectors. I am hopeful, therefore, that my work of control will become less onerous in detail, and that I may be able to give a larger measure of assistance in dealing with questions of State finance. I have completed the draft of a specific tariff, and this will form the basis for the negotiations in connection with the new treaty of commerce with Austria-Hungary. The preliminary meeting of the Turkish delegates (I am acting as one) will take place next week. The Turkish Government is anxious to replace their present ad valorem system by a specific tariff, and this desire is not unreasonable. An ad valorem system entails serious disadvantages from an administrative standpoint, and the uniform ad valorem system in force here is, in its rigidity, singularly defective as an instrument for international commercial negotiations. The specific tariff upon which I have been engaged is designed primarily for revenue purposes. It is not intended to impose protective rates on manufactured articles or articles of large consumption. The economic condition of the country is, indeed, not such as would justify the imposition of protective duties on goods of that description. A simple specific tariff for revenue purposes is,, however, in my view, necessary for the consolidation of the financial and commercial interests of the countrv, and it will remove many of the difficulties which exporters now experience in relation to the valuation of their goods. I want to be brief, but there is one other point which may be of interest to Sir E. Grey. For some time I have had under consideration plans for the construction of a new custom-house and bonded warehouses at Bagdad. Under the Bagdad Railway Concession (articles 23 and 24) the company has powers to construct a port and warehouses at Bagdad (also at Bussorah). I have therefore advised the Government not to embark upon an expensive scheme of building customs depots at Bagdad withcut first ascertaining the intentions of the railway company as to the exercise of their [2292 5-12]powers under tlie concession. It is obviously desirable tbat tbe customs buildings should be in proximity to the port and to the railway depots. I have recently discussed this matter with the director-general of the company, and it is not impiobable that an arrangement may be made for the compan } 7 to construct the customs buildings ii return for a concession to exploit the bonded warehouses and transit depots under the control of the customs administration. I have mentioned this matter to the Ambassador, as it will shortly be necessary to proceed with the construction of further customs buildings at Bussorah. Under the recent arrangement with the Germans, the line south of Bagdad would be worked by an international company and the construction of the port and terminus at Bussbrah or at Ivoweit w r ould be undertaken by this company. So far as regards Turkish customs administration there would be serious objections to the port terminus being fixed at Ivoweit. For in that case it would be necessary either to have a Turkish customs at Koweit, which would at. once create difficulties of jurisdiction for customs offences and irregularities, or. it would be necessary to discharge again at the Bussorah customs the goods which had been disembarked and put on rail at Koweit. Moreover, if the port terminus were fixed at Koweit it would necessitate the dislocation of the existing commercial and banking- agencies at Bussorah. So that Bussorah, if it possesses the required physical facilities, would be the more suitable terminus from an administrative and commercial point of view. Bussorah would also be ^the real centre of control for the through transit trade to Persia, since the formalities of examination and transit charges would be carried out at Bussorah and the goods would go on via Bagdad to the Persian frontier franked by “ through documents ” issued by the Bussorah customs, and Bussorah would control also the traffic coming from Persia. I mention this point to show that the international company would have the major control over the Persian transit trade. From my conversations with Huguenin (the director-general of the Bagdad Railway) it is probable, I think, that the company may decide to proceed with the Bagdad-Hanekin section at an early date, because the Persian transit traffic will be at once a profit-earning business. It is possible therefore that an earlier solution of the Bussorah-Bagdad question may be considered desirable in view of approaching developments at Bagdad. I am looking, of course, only to the practical aspects of this question as it comes before me in relation to customs and commercial considerations. AVith kind regards, &amp;c. R. F.

I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknow- r U' ledge the receipt of your letter (No. 50743), with its enclosures, relative to a proposal to replace the pre sent ad valorem system of Customs duties in Turkey by a specific Tariff, and also to a proposal that the Bagdad Railway Company should be allowed to construct Customs buildings and exploit bonded warehouses at Bagdad and Bussorah. In reply I am to say, as regards the first propos al, that the Board think that His Majesty’s Government need not object in principle to the substitution of a specific for an ad valorem Tariff if all the other Powers concerned should be in agreement on the subject. Such a substitution might, conceivably, in some cases prove of advantage to British exporters who are some times l c u /-i * V 1 b i c f ie Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.sometimes subjected to unfair competition by exporters from other countries! in the shape of fraudulent declara tions of value. Any detailed proposals in this direc tion would of course have to be submitted to very care ful scrutiny - not only as regards the valuations, but also as regards the classifications adopted - from the point of view of their probable effect on British in terests, Particular attention would naturally have to be paid to the schedule of duties on cotton goods. The necessity of adopting a simple and intelligible class ification of duties, v/hich will reduce to a minimum the opportunities for Customs disputes is also a matter of vital importance to trade. The fact that the pro posed specific tariff is being elaborated by Sir R. Crawford affords some presumption that these matters will not be overlooked. I am to add that as soon as a copy of the draft tariff on which Sir R. Crawford has been engaged can be confidentially obtained, the Board will be prepared to examine it carefully from the above points of view. With reference, however, to that part of Sir R. Crawford’s letter - enclosed in your letter under reply -reply - which suggests that such a tariff may he used in the forthcoming negotiations between Turkey and Austria-Hungary, the Board presume that His Majesty's Government would only consent to take part in any negotiations for the imposition of a specific tariff as part of a general scheme for the conclusion of new commercial treaties by Turkey to which the new tariff would be scheduled. In the event of these treaties being denounced the existing ad valorem tariff would of course automatically revive. In any new Anglo- Turkish treaty it might perhaps be desirable to stip ulate for the periodical revision of the tariff as a consequence of changes in prices. As regards the other proposal, viz., for the coni* struction of a Customs house and of bonded warehouses at Bagdad by the Bagdad Bailway Company, it appears premature to make any arrangements for this purpose until the Company which will work the line south of Bagdad has been formed. Inasmuch as the lines south and north of Bagdad respectively will he worked hy fifferent companies, the Board would prefer that the construction of Customs buildings should be the joint undertakingundertaking of the two companies rather than that of tha existing Bagdad Railway Company alone. As regards the proposed buildings at Bussorah, on the other hand, it would seem more appropriate that the construction should be conceded to the proposed International Com pany I have &amp;c.

On the contrary we are as desirous to-day as we were 4/5 years ago of securing this Concession and Mr. Nichols, who has been representing us in Constantinople, has been constantly engaged in nego tiations in this direction, and has only been in London during the past few months because owing to the political position there seemed to be no pros pect of making any further progress for the time being. plicated during the past few months by the renewed Louis Mallet Esq., C.B., Foreign Office.Chester scheme, and by the uncertainty on the part of the Turkish Government as to whether or not they will deal with the Oil Concession for Baghdad and Moussoul separately, as a whole, or in conjunction with the construction of a Railway or Railways, Mr. Nichols, who will personally explain the position to you, is being kept regularly posted up by our Agents in Constantinople and whenever there is any prospect of continuing the negotiations suc cessfully he will at once return to that place. In the meantime I shall be much obliged if you will advise Sir Gerald Lowther that we shall much appreciate any information or recommendations which he may be able to give. Yours sincerely, (Signed) C.
