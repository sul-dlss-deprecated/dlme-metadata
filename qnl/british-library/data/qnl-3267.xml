Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) Monsieur Mahmood Riyad Zada, (Sd) G.W.Rendel. &amp;c c*C *Note on visit of He.iaz ITe.id Government M ission to 33urox&gt;e , On March 23rd the Hejazi Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed Mr,Hope Gill that Ibn Saud intended to send the Amir Faisal, accompanied toy Puad Hamza, on a mission to Europe, ^e asked whether His Majesty 1 s Government would receive the mission,and a similar enquiry was addressed to the Foreign Office by the Hejazi Minister in London. The representatives at Jedda of France and Italy, and apparently also those of Turkey and Persia, were similarly notified of the Mission. Mr,Hope Gill has been instructed to inform the Hejazi -Nejd Government that His Majesty's Government will be pleased to receive the mission,and a similar reply has been addressed to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in London. The Italian representative at Jedda arranged for the mission to sail for Naples in an Italian liner on April 12th. The party arrived in Rome on April 19th. They are expected to spend 8 or 10 days in Italy, and it is understood that they will complete the ratification of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Italy and the Hejaz. The itinerary will then be via Geneva to Paris. The mission is expected in England early in May and the duration of the visit is expected to be about 10 days. It is understood that the Mission will then visit the Hague,Berlin,Warsaw and probably Moscow,and thence go to Angora in June,and Tehran at the end of June. This programme is presumably only provisional. Information will be sent of future developments.

The mission, which consists of £he Emir Jfeisal, Faud hamza, and some staff, hafl been in London during the last week, having visited Italy, Geneva, and Paris en route. They are now leaving for the Hague, Berlin, Warsaw and probably Moscow, whence they go to Angora, Tehran, and Baghdad. We understand they they propose to return home £sxm from Baghdad vi« Kuwait. I do not know whether they have made any definite plans yet for the latter part of their tour, but you will like to know that they liave in mind a visit to Kuwait on their way back. Possibly, though we have heard nothing, they have already been in touch with the Sheikh. The latest information we have is that they are likely to reach Tehran at the end of June, so if they adhere to Lheii itinerary, they will probably be in Kuwait some time in July.

THE first meeting with the Hejaz-Nejd Mission was held in the Foreign Office at 12-15 p.m . on the 9th May. Present: Sir L. Oliphant {in the Chair). The Emir Feisal. Mr. G. W. Rendel. I he Hejaz Minister, Fuad Bey Hamza. Mr. C. F. A. Warner. M. Zada (Secretary of the Legation). The business was of a formal nature. Sir L. Olifhant, after a complimentary reference to the presence of the mission in this country, and to the good relations existing between the two Governments, said that he wa^ at the disposal of the mission for the discussion of any questions which they might wish to raise, and suggested that it might be convenient that a meeting should be held in the afternoon for this purpose. The Emir Feisal, after expressing pleasure at the friendship which bound the two countries, agreed to Sir L. Oliphant's proposal, and it was arranged that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Fuad Bey Hamza should come to the Foreign Office for a further meeting at 4 o'clock. Sir L. Oliphant said that the Emir would have learnt already from His Majesty the King, and from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that it was their desire that the most cordial relations should be maintained. The Emir Feisal expressed the pleasure with which he had heard these sentiments from His Majesty and Sir John Simon, and said that his father set great store by the maintenance of such good relations. Sir L. Oliphant enquired whether there was any question which the Emir Feisal wished to discuss. The Emir replied that he had already alluded to the one question of fundamental importance. It was their desire that there should be between the two countries a true friendship, not merely an official one. He was much gratified by the assurances he had received on this point. He did not himself wish to raise any other questions, and would leave the discussion of any other points to Fuad Bey Hamza. Foreign Office, May 9, 1932.

Present; Foreign Office. Hejaz and Nejd Delegation. Sir L Oliphant. The Minister for the Hejaz and Nejd r Mr. G. W. Ren del. Fuad Bey Hamza. Mr. C. F. A. Warner. SIR L. OLIPHANT asked Fuad Bey Hamza to mention any questions which the delegation wished to discuss. Fuad Bey Hamza replied that King Abdul Aziz had instructed them to raise the following points: — I. The main purpose of the mission was to ascertain whether His Majesty s Government still felt for the Hejaz-Nejd Government the same goodwill as in the past, and still desired the maintenance of close relations ot triendsinp. Kins: Abdul Aziz had been anxious for some time past as to whethei Mis Maiesty's Government's attitude towards him had not undergone some modification. He had mentioned the matter to Sir Andrew Ryan m June last, and Sir Andrew had no doubt reported it. His Majesty hoped to receive trom His Maiesty's Government, not only formal support, but also moral and material support, such as he had received from His Majesty's Government m earlier days. The mission were, therefore, to ask for an assurance on this point and to enquire to what extent His Majesty's Government are prepared to support and advise the Heiaz-Nejd in time of need. King Abdul Aziz also wanted to know how he should guide his policy in order to meet the views of His Majesty s Government. This was the principal purpose of their mission. II.— Economic Questions. Fuad Bey Hamza emphasised the present economic difficulties of the Hejaz- Neid King Abdul Aziz ardently desired the help of His Majesty's Government. The needs of the Hejaz-Nejd Government are numerous. They require, above all, financial help. The mission was therefore charged to enquire whether His Majesty's Government could make a loan to the Hejaz-Nejd Government and help them in other ways in their economic difficulties. III.— Haramein Wakfs. There were in countries under British control various pious foundations,, the proceeds of which, according to the wishes of the founders, should be devoted to the Holy Places of Islam. These proceeds are not now received m Mecca, and the Hejaz-Nejd Government desired the help of His Majesty's Government in putting this right. IV.—Trans] or dan. Fuad Bey remarked that it was useless to disguise that there had been considerable difficulties between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan. The mission was charged by King Abdul Aziz to declare his readiness to make with Trans]ordan similar arrangements to those recently made with Iraq. [462 i—2]V.— Soviet A cMvities and Propaganda. They were also to enquire, as King Abdul Aziz had enquired in the past, what policy His Majesty's Government would advise him to follow in regard to Soviet activities. Fuad Bey Hamza said that these were the points which the mission were instructed to take up with His Majesty's Government. The one of fundamental importance was the first. If the reply on that point was encouraging, the others could be dealt with in turn. Sir L. Olifhant then replied on each of these five points in turn. As to I, the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the Hejaz-Nejd, he said he had always been puzzled when, from time to time, it was reported that King Abdul Aziz felt doubts as to the continuance of the friendly attitude of His Majesty's Government. He assured Fuad Bey Hamza emphatically that in fundamentals that attitude was as cordial as ever. He stressed the phrase 'in fundamentals.' With the extension of the dominions of King Abdul Aziz, the points of contact with His Majesty's Government had increased in number. Since the war. His Majesty's Government had certain connexions with terri tories which were adjacent to those dominions and which formerly had been part of the Turkish Empire. Sir Lancelot emphasised that these were not colonies, but mandated territories, and that this distinction connoted a real difference of relationship, and a real difference in the degree of control exercised by His Majesty's Government. With the more numerous points of contact, occasions of differences between His Majesty's Government and the Hejaz-Nejd Government had naturally arisen. King Abdul Aziz, before now, had explained that, when he spoke frankly, it was because it was appropriate to do so between friends. His Majesty's Government agreed with this sentiment, and when causes of difficulty arose, they, too, believed in speaking frankly, as the best means of clearing up differences between friends. His Majesty must, therefore, not misunderstand them when they did so, or think that this showed a change of fundamental attitude. As he said before, he could give an absolute assurance that, fundamentally. His Majesty's Government's attitude remained one of sincere friendship. Sir Lancelot added that, if Fuad Bey, when he returned to his country, would explain this to His Majesty, and remove any misapprehensions which he might have on this subject, the mission's visit to this country would have been well worth while. Fuad Bey Hamza expressed his pleasure at Sir L. Oliphant's statement, and he said he would do his best on his return to the Hejaz to eradicate from King Abdul Aziz s mind any mistaken ideas that might remain on this subject. Passing to II, the missions request for a loan, Sir L. Olifhant explained the difficulties in this time of most stringent economy. He would not mislead Fuad Bey into thinking it was at all likely that the mission's request could be acceded to. He would, however, put the point to the Treasury and would give an answer soon, so that the mission might, if they wished, approach financial houses, although he feared that from that quarter, too, the chances of getting a loan were remote. Fuad Bey Hamza said that, if His Majesty's Government could not themselves make a loan to his Government, they could, perhaps, arrange one with some financial houses. His Government only required a loan of £500 000 In answer to a question, he explained that he meant £500,000 gold, or its equivalent, and that he had data as to what could be offered as security. Sit L. Oliphant said that, while he could not encourage any hope in Fuad Bey, he would consult the competent department. v In AK^ a A d -^ ! IT ' , Haramein Wakfs, Sir L. Oliphant recalled that King Abdul Aziz had made a similar request some years ago, and His Maiestv's Government had given a written reply. The Government of India could not i ,, ll|i ' , ru ^ns and quasi-religious matters, and there were no religious r V i - but His Majesty s Government had explained that, if the Hejaz- Mejd Government wished, they could have recourse to the civil courts, and had3 expressed readiness to consider sympathetically any request for assistance 01 advice. Fuad Bey Hamza said that there were Wakfs administered by Government departments in British-controlled territory, e.g. (i) There were Wakfs in Palestine, administered by the Supreme Moslem Council. i (ii) Certain moneys, sent by the Nizam of Hyderabad, were distributed m the Hejaz. Fuad Bey seemed to think that these might be the proceeds of Wakfs. ' - . t (iii) A certain Ali Surraty (? Surati), probably an Indian, died m J a\a, leaving properties in Rangoon, the proceeds of one-third of which were to be devoted to the poor in Medina and Mecca. The Hejaz-Nejd Government had applied to the authorities in Java, who replied that they could do nothing in respect of the properties in Burma, and that application should be made to the Administrator-General of Trusts there. Nothing had been received by the Hejaz-Nejd Government. Fuad Bey also said that his Government might wish to send a delegation to India to make enquiries. Sir L. Olifhant said that he would cause enquiries to be made regarding these specific cases which Fuad Bey had mentioned, and that no doubt such assistance as might be possible would be readily given by the India Office, e.g., they would probably be ready to advise the Hejaz-Nejd Government as to the choice of legal representatives if required. In regard to point IV, Transjordan, Sir L. Oliyliant said that there was no use disguising the fact that relations on the frontier had given rise to considerable friction, and that in 1930 they were very bad indeed. He did not wish to go into details at the moment. It was, however, in his opinion, a very good sign that King Abdul Aziz should now have declared his readiness to make with Transjordan similar agreements to those made with Iraq. The matter was not, however, quite plain sailing; as he had already mentioned, Transjordan was not a colony, but a mandated territory, and there were quarters in which difficulties in this matter might arise. He would have the question examined As regards V, the question of relations with the Soviet, Sir L. Oliphant said that he would refer the matter to the Secretary of State. Fuad Bey Hamza said that the relations of the Hejaz-Nejd Government with the Soviet were unique; they had diplomatic relations, but the Hejaz-Nejd Government maintained an embargo on Soviet imports. Reminded of the contract for the supply of certain consignments of Soviet benzine to the Hejaz-Nejd, Fuad Bey Hamza said that that was a Government contract, and an exception to the general rule. In reply to Sir L. Oliphanfs enquiry whether there was any other question which he wished to raise, Fuad Bey Hamza said that, as he had already mentioned, the Hejaz-Nejd Government looked to His Majesty's Government for material as well as for moral support. An American engineer (Fuad Bey Hamza no doubt referred to Mr. Twitchell) had recently been exploring the mineral resources of the Hejaz and Hasa, and had presented reports which he (Fuad Bey) had with him. King Abdul Aziz always preferred to deal with the British, and would welcome the assistance of British firms in exploiting the mineral resources of his country. Sir L. Oliphant intimated that British firms might hesitate to accept the report not drawn up by a British expert, and that there might be doubt as to the readiness of British firms to sink capital in a little-known country at the present time. , tA... .A )V THIS DOCOMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOYERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). j ' ;i __,May 13, 1932.

Record of Third Meeting with the Hejaz-Nejd Delegation, held at the Foreign r Office on May 13, 1932, at 11-30 a.m. Present. Foreign Office. Heja\z-Nejd Delegation. Sir L. Oliphant {in the Chair). The Hejazi Minister Mr. G. W. Rendel Fuad Bey Hamza. Mr. C. F. A. Warner. SIR L. OLIPHANT said that he was now in a position to reply, one by one, to the points raised 1 by Fuad Bey Hamza at the previous meeting; he hoped that Fuad Bey would thereafter ask for any elucidation which he might desire. I. He wished to confirm the assurance which he had given to the delegation at the last meeting, that His Majesty's Government desired, as in the past, the most cordial and friendly relations with the Hejazi Government. II. As regards a loan by His Majesty's Government, it was quite out of the question for them to meet the wishes of the Hejazi Government in the matter. But arrangements had been made since the last meeting that Fuad Bey Hamza should be received at the Bank of England, where he would be given explanations as to the present financial situation in the city and could discuss the possibility of a public loan or one by some reputable financial house. But in saying this he did not desire to raise any false hopes. He had also spoken to the chairman of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the chief manager of the bank, Mr. Eldred, would be happy to see Fuad Bey and to explain to him the preliminaries necessary before the flotation of a loan. But as the present time was most unpropitious for any financial ventures, Mr. Eldred would discuss the possibility of the Imperial Bank of Persia acting as London correspondents of the Hejazi Government, should this be desired. Sir L. Oliphant had also consulted a high official of the Treasury, who had confirmed his conviction that there was little, if any, chance of a loan for the Hejazi Government being entertained in the City at the present time. III. As regards the Haramein Wakfs, the India Office had telegraphed to the Government of India, with special reference to the bequest of Ali Surati, who had died in Java, the case to which Fuad Bey Hamza had specifically referred. The Colonial Office had also consulted the Government of Palestine about the Palestine Wakfs, raised by Fuad Bey Hamza, but the reply which they had received was not clear. These two points would be actively pursued, and an answer made to the Hejazi Government as soon as possible. IV. Dealing Avith Transjordan, Sir L. Oliphant said that, as he had already told Fuad Bey Hamza, he personally thought that if agreements could be made between the Hejaz iand Nejd and Transjordan similar to those made between the Hejaz and Nejd and Iraq, it would make a vast difference in the relations between the two countries; and while there were considerable difficulties in the way, a further study of the matter would be pursued energetically. V. As regards the question of relations between the Hejaz and Nejd and' the Soviet Government, the opinion of His Majesty's Government was that the views and tenets of the Soviet Government were presumably very different from those of King Abdul Aziz. If, however. King Abdul Aziz thought fit, in spite of this, to change his present policy towards the Soviet Government, it would, of course, not be a matter upon which His Majesty's Government would be in a position to feel aggrieved. Fuad Bey Hamza ^aid that he wished, as regards point I, to express his thanks for the assurances given by Flis Majesty's Government; he would communicate them to King Abdul Aziz. [462 n—1]It was a great personal grief and disappointment to him that His Majesty's Government could not see their way to assist the Hejazi Government with a loan. His Government might now have no alternative, but to look elsewhere for help. He wished to be quite frank and not to leave His Majesty's Government under a false impression. Sir L. Olifhant here interrupted him to assure him that it was a matter of great regret to His Majesty's Government also, and that it was of course natural that the Hejazi Government should try to raise a loan elsewhere; and that His Majesty's Government would not for a moment misunderstand such action. Fuad Bey Hamza continued that in connexion with Transjordan, the Hejazi Government would wait to hear further from His Majesty's Government. The proposal for the conclusion of agreements had been made in the interests of the two countries and not from any personal motives. As regards the Soviet, he thought it unlikely that there would be any important change in the attitude of his Government. At Mr. Rendel's suggestion, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned the proposal which he had raised before the meeting that His Majesty's Government should reconsider their decision as regards the despatch of a Royal Air Force training mission to the Hejaz and Nejd; but this was to be regarded as a personal suggestion of his own. He was assured that the matter would be examined. The meeting was then concluded.V V 61/28 9^ Telegram Prom To a.T.o. H .S .the Eigti Commissi or) er, Baghdad.

June 21st 1952, Sir, I have the honour to report that on June 8th His Highness the Emir Peisul, son of the King of Hejaz- Nejci, arrived in Constantinople by Soviet steamer from Odessa. He was accompanied to Turkey by M.Plorinski, Soviet Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, end both on his arrival end during his stay in Turkey, has been the object of assiduous attentions on the part of members of the Soviet Embassy. 2. After a short stay in Constantinople, the Emir, with his suite, among whom were Fuad Hamza Bey, deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs,and Halid Syubi Bey, aide-de-camp, left for Angora in a special saloon coach placed at their disposal by the Turkish Government,and was the guest of the Government from June 12 to June 15, afterwards returning to Constantinople where he is to spend a few days before leaving for Tehran via the Caucasus, and thence for Baghdad. 3. While at Angora the Emir was received by the President of the Republic, who gave a dinner in his honour at his new x'esicience at Cankaya, end was the guest at banquets or receptions given by Ismet Pasha, Tevfik Hdstft Bey, Kazim Pasha, President of the Grand National Assembly,and Hikmet Bey, Secretary -General of the Gazi. In deference to RIGHT HONOURABLE ' uhe SIR JOHN SIMON, G.C.S .I.,K.C.V.O., etc, ' ' e1: ' c *} I the opinions 01 the Emir, no alcoholic refreshments were served at these gatherings, in his turn, the Smir gave a dinner to the President of the Republic and leading Turks. Before leaving Angora the Emir had an amicable conversation at the Irak Legation with His Highness the Smir Zeid, Minister of Irak and brother to the King of that country. 4. In the course of the dinner given at Cankaya by the President of the Republic, speeches were exchanged which, while on conventional lines, were marked with slightly more restraint on the Wahabi than on the Turkish side. The Gasi expressed his pleasure at the efforts which were being made to set the Hejaz and Nejd on the way of progress, and his best wishes for the future of those countries under the strong administration of King Abdulaziz, while the Emir confined himself to acknowledging with thanks the Gasi's wishes and reciprocating them. The official communique issued on the conclusion of the visit referred to cordial and sincere conversations, harmony of views, feelings of mutual confidence and the influence of that visit on the consolidation of peace in the Near East. 5. The time between banquets was devoted to inspections of banking and military establishments. In this latter connection it is noticable that the visit of the Emir to Turkey is distinguished from that of other important personages by the exhibition to him of part of Turkey^ mmta^ymilitary resources, and 'by the rather unusual participation, in his reception and in his send-off, of high military authorities* The Smir was shown over military factories and barracks, under the guidance of Ali Sait Pasha,Army Inspector, he assisted at tactical exercises, was present at a display of military horsemanship, and witnessed an aerial review in which some twenty-five military aeroplanes from Eskisehir took part.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Emir Feisal, accompanied by his suite, arrived in Moscow from Warsaw on the 29th May. He was met at the frontier by officials of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and was greeted by brass bands which, according to the press, ' played the Internationale and various Arabian airs.' On his arrival in Moscow, where the station was decorated with bunting inscribed with Arabic expressions of welcome, the Emir was received by Comrade Krestinski among other officials, and by the Persian Ambassador. 2. The Emir's visit followed the usual programme provided for State guests considered to belong to the second category of importance. He was received by Kalinin, the president of the Central Executive Committee, on the day of his arrival and a dinner and reception in his honour were given by the Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs in the evening. Members of the Diplomatic Corps were invited to the reception. Before leaving for Leningrad on the 2nd June, the Emir met Comrades Molotov and Kuibyshev among other Soviet notables, while the visits paid by him included an inspection of the '' October military camp, and of an aeroplane factory in Moscow. The Emir and his suite returned to Moscow on the 5th June and left in the evening for Constantinople, whither he was accompanied by the head of the Protocol Department of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. 3. The speeches which were made during the visit appear to have been confined to an exchange of the usual courtesies. No great prominence has been given to the visit in the press. On the day of his arrival, however, the ' Izvestiya ' published a leading article summarising the post-war history of Hejaz and Nejd, and in particular their relations with the U.S.S.R. This article was an unembroidered account of facts unaccompanied by socialistic ideology, and emphasised that the Soviet Union was the first Power to recognise the Government of Ibn Saud.

I HAVE the honour to report that on the 8th June His Highness the Emir Eeisal, son of the King of Hejaz-Nejd, arrived in Constantinople by Soviet steamer from Odessa. He was accompanied to Turkey by M. Elorinski, Soviet Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, and both on his arrival and during his stay in Turkey has been the object of assiduous attentions on the part of members of the Soviet Embassy. 2. After a short stay in Constantinople, the Emir, with his suite, among whom were Euad Hamza Bey, deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Halid Eyubi Bey, aide-de-camp, left for Angora in a special saloon coach placed at their disposal by the Turkish Government, and was the guest of the Government from the 12th to the 15th June, afterwards returning to Constantinople, where he is to spend a few days before leaving for Tehran via the Caucasus, and thence for Bagdad. 3. While at Angora the Emir was received by the President of the Republic, who gave a dinner in his honour at his new residence at Cankaya, and was the guest at banquets or receptions given by Ismet Pasha, Tevfik Rii^tii Bey, Kazim Pasha, President of the Grand National Assembly, and Hikmet Bey, secretary- general of the Gazi. In deference to the opinions of the Emir, no alcoholic refreshments were served at these gatherings. In his turn, the Emir gave a dinner to the President of the Republic and leading Turks. Before leaving Angora the Emir had an amicable conversation at the Iraq Legation with His Highness the Emir Zeid, Minister of Iraq and brother to the King of that country. 4. In the course of the dinner given at Cankaya by the President of the Republic, speeches were exchanged which, while on conventional lines, were marked with slightly more restraint on the Wahabi than on the Turkish side. The Gazi expressed his pleasure at the efforts which were being made to set the Hejaz and Nejd on the way of progress, and his best wishes for the future of those countries under the strong administration of King Abdulaziz, while the Emir confined himself to acknowledging with thanks the Gazi's wishes and reciprocating them. The official communique issued on the conclusion of the visit referred to cordial and sincere conversations, harmony of views, feelings of mutual confidence, and the influence of that visit on the consolidation of peace in the Near East. 5. The time between banquets was devoted to inspections of banking and military establishments. In this latter connexion it is noticeable that the visit of the Emir to Turkey is distinguished from that of other important personages by the exhibition to him of part of Turkey's military resources, and by the rather unusual participation, in his reception and in his send-off, of high military authorities. The Emir was shown over military factories and barracks, under the guidance of Ali Sait Pasha, Army Inspector; he assisted at tactical exercises, was present at a display of military horsemanship, and witnessed an aerial review in which some twenty-five military aeroplanes from Eski^ehir took part. One of these flew into an obstacle when starting and the pilot was killed. The others indulged in formation flying, which to a lay observer seemed rather ragged, but the diving and other acrobatic feats seemed temerarious but successful. 6. Press comment on the visit is curiously unanimous in insisting that Turkey's interest in Hejaz and Nejd arises out of pleasure at their having won complete independence, and in declaring that it is, and always has been, Turkey's desire that Moslem States detached from the Ottoman Empire should have complete independence. For this reason she has always disliked the term 'mandate,' which signifies subjection. She had only consented to cede the [516 a—1] 1 I IVilayet of Mosul because the cession was to be made to an independent Iraq. The line to be followed in regard to Syria by France, which is at present enjoying a ' bad press ' in Turkey, is thus clearly indicated.

Sir ' T T i Bagdad, July 14, 1932. 1 HAVE the honour to refer to my telegram No. 252, dated the 4th July, 1932, and to make the following report on the Amir Feisal's visit to Iraq ' 2. His Highness arrived at Khanaqin on the evening of the 7th July. He was met by Dr. Naji-al-Assil, the Iraqi Charge d'Affaires in Jedda, and by representatives of King Feisal and the Iraqi Government. From Khanaqin his Highness was brought to Bagdad by a special train in which he was accommodated in the Royal saloon. On arrival he was received by the Acting Prime Minister Jafar Pasha and by a large representative gathering of officials and notables. A guard of honour was provided by the Royal bodyguard. 3. His Majesty King Feisal put his country house at Harthiyah at the disposal of his guest, and I had the honour of being received by him there shortly after his arrival. I found his Highness looking very tired but doing his best to maintain an appearance of pleased interest in all that was being done to honour and entertain him. A little later, after his visit to the King, the Amir returned my call at the Residency in company with Fuad Beg Ha'mza. His Highness gave me a friendly message from his father, and was good enough to sa\ that King Abdul Azir-al-Saud had often spoken to him of the pleasure which the conference on board H.M.S. ' Lupin ' in 1930 had given him. 4. On the first evening of his visit his Highness was entertained at a banquet given in his honour at the palace; the following evening he attended another banquet given by the Acting Prime Minister in the Municipal Gardens, and on the last day of his stay I had the pleasure of receiving his Highness and his stall' as my guests at a dinner-party at the Residency. Early on the morning of the 11th July, the Amir left Bagdad for Koweit in a Royal Air Force Victoria, which the Air Officer Commanding had kindly placed at his Highness's disposal. ' 5. The Amir s visit passed off quietly without incident, and his pleasant manners created an agreeable impression on all with whom he came in contact. Before his arrival, I had advised King Feisal that he should endeavour to profit from his Highness's visit, not only to settle outstanding differences between the Iraqi and Nejd-Hejazi Governments concerning the location of the Iraqi Legation in the Hejaz, but also to do what he could to prepare the way for a better understanding between the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn Sand. I suggested that His Majesty should compromise with King Ibn Sand over the Legation difficulty by agreeing that the Iraqi Legation should be in Jedda, provided that the Hejazi Government would allow the Iraqi mission to have an unofficial house at Mecca which they could use when they visited the capital on business. I also hinted that the Iraqi mission might be less suspiciously received, if His Majesty were to appoint as its chief a man who was not com promised in the eyes of the Nejd-Hejazi Government by previous personal contact with Flejazi affairs. As regards relations between the Hejaz and Transjordan, I recalled the immediate relaxation of dangerous tension which had followed on His Majesty's meeting with the King Ibn Saud in 1930, and said that I was confident that similarly beneficial results could be obtained from a rapprochement between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, if His Majesty would use his good offices to bring this about. 6. After the x\mir's departure, the King told me that he had discussed both these matters on the lines I had suggested. He was hopeful that the compromise proposed about the location of the Iraqi Legation would be accepted by King Ibn Saud, but he anticipated that the latter might ask for the Iraqi representative to be a Minister and not a Charge d'Affaires. I think King Feisal would agree [542 c—2]to tins, provided thcit the JMmister is allowed to ]ici\e ci liouse in JVleccR cmd an assurance is given that he will be treated properly and not shadowed by spies, as Dr. Naji-al-Assil complains he always wa^s when he went to Mecca. 7 As regards Transjordan-Nejd relations, the Iving said that the Anur Feisal had undertaken to try to persuade his father to telegraph to His Majesty requesting his mediation with a view to the conclusion of a good neighbourly relations treaty between Transjordan and Nejd and the Hejaz on the lines of that which had recently been concluded between Iraq and Nejd and the Hejaz. The King seemed hopeful that King Ibn Saud would do this and said that in that event he would go to Amman to persuade the Amir Abdullah to come into line. . 8. His Majesty also revealed to me that he had learnt that the Amir was far from pleased with Fuad Hamza who had been too self-assertive during their tour in Europe. He thought that the latter would not long remain in power after his return to Nejd. 9. In my own talks with the Amir I kept to general topics, but in conversa tion with Fuad Hamza I gathered that he regarded the Ibn Rifada invasion as a matter of second-rate importance and that he was convinced that His Majesty's Government were doing everything that was possible to bring it to a ignominious conclusion. 10. I enclose a copy of a telegram which I received from the Amir Feisal after his departure from Bagdad. 11. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan. I have, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS, High Commissioner for Iraq.

The tour included a week-long trip to London in May, where Emir Faisal [Fayṣal] met King George V, and representatives of the Kingdom of Hejaz-Najd met with British officials from the Foreign Office. The main subject of the discussions between officials of both countries was a request from the Kingdom of Hejaz-Najd for financial assistance (in the form of loans) from the British Government. The request was turned down by British officials, in light of the existing economic circumstances (folio 18-23). The volume contains numerous reports from a variety of British officials at the Foreign Office in London, the Political Agency in Bahrain, and British embassies based in countries which Faisal visited, giving details of the Emir's movements and appointments, which took him to Rome, Geneva, Paris, London, The Hague, Berlin, Constantinople, and Tehran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00023f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
