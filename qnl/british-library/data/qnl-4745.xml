X have the honour to report on the conduct of the Sharjah negotiation. 2. On May 30th I arranged for Major Holmes to have an interview with the Shaikh of Sharjah on the morning of the 31st May tut owing to some misunderstanding Major Holmes never went to see the Shaikh who waited all morning. On my return from Has al Khaimah on the after noon of the 31st May I was immediately informed of the fact that xhe interview had not taken place and, through the Residency Agent, fixed another time for the following day and personally informed Major Holmes. 3. As a result of the interview on the 1st of June it seems to have been arranged for ’Abdullah bin Paris, the Secretary to the Shaikh of Sharjah, to negotiate with Major Holmes. I myself saw ’Abdullah bin Paris and impressed on him how advisable it was for the Shaikh to come to agreement with the Company. Conversations then took place between the parties and on one occasion ’Abdullah / ~uv«»xu«uu;y A^ern^'fi cap to go to Dubai to see Major Holmes# 4# On the 2nd June Major Holmes told me that he had had &amp; very successful interview with the Secretary and that they hoped the financial question would be settled by tlie next morning as the Secretary had stated that he would see hie master that night and persuade him to come to agreement* Major holmes 1 clerk was also present when this statement was made and gave it as hie own opinion that the matter was as good as settled# The following morning Major Holmes called to see me and ^aid nothing had been settled f tliat the bhalkh had reduced hie demand to hs«jL16 f OOO/~ and that he* the Major, would not go further than Hs#B6,CXX)/- and that he had told ’Abdullah bin Furls so# 1 asked him if the other points of which X knew there were a number, as on Arabic copy of them had been given to him by the Shaikh at hir, interview on the 1st June, had been settled and I gathered thaw they li&amp;d not even been discussed# I interviewed the Shaikh on the same after - noon l#e# June brd and reasoned with him for an hour and a half all to no purpose# he said that he had given his proposed ammendments to the concession to Major Holmes on the 1st of June and that he had not had any reply from him# That 6&gt;o f:*r he had 2 K&gt;t discussed the concession at all and that nothing 'Ould persuade him to reduce his financial terms from He#2,OC 9 OOOA on signature of the concession# 1 gathered from his general conversation that he was principally concerned with the money question and that his other suggested conditions could be overcome if the money question was sa tisfactorally solved# Eventually I decided that I could do no more than arrange an inteiview for L&amp;jor Holmes with the Jhaikh which I did for /ll il Iff 3 ** for 8 a •in* Friday June 4th«After again advicing the Shaikh to do all he could to bring about an early agreement X returned to the Best Houee and informed Major Holmes of what had taken place at my interview and the conclusions I had come to* I told Major Holmes that in my opinion and that of the Residency Agent* the Shaikh was not influenced by any member of his family and unlike Dubai had no council to consult before agree ing to the various clauses of the concession and that the only man who had any influence with him was his Secretary, Abdullah bin Faris* I further told the Majorthat in all probability, the Shaikh would try and pretend that he was not a free agent ana that he must consult his relatives, but that in my opinion this amounted to nothing and would only be used as an endeavour to squeeze more out of the Company* 6* On June 4th Major Holmes had a lengthy interview with the Shaikh* I saw him immediately afterwards and he appear satisfied with the morning’s work* Immediately after Major Homes had left me, I saw the Residency Agent who had come straight from the Shaikh* He told me that only three points mum had been discussed in two and a half hours and no conclusion reached on them* I had decided that if I wished to form a reasonable opinion of the progress of events, it was necessary for me to hear the views of both sides and, for this reason, from this day I arranged for the Residency Agent to interview the Shaikh as soon as the representative of Petrolraa Concessions had left* This procedure does not appear to have pleased Major Holmes but it has attained its object as far as I am concerned* 6* On June 6th another interview took place and afterwards Major Holmes informed me that he had not made as /-4 s.B much progress as he had hoped and that the Shaikh had put forward four of his points which were (a) that the oil, if any, should he piped to Sharjah for export (b) that a drilling pro^arame should he included in the concession (c) that if the work had not commenced in three years, the Shaikh Should have the right to cancel the agreement and(d) that the Arabic version of the concession agreement should prevail* Major Holmes informed the Shaikh that he could not even consider these aamieadmen ws • Again I understood the Major to say that no mention haa heeii jaade of the financial clause, as yet the Shaikh had intimated that he was not/ready to discuss the matter* Later I discussed the question with the Residency Agent who had seen the Shaikh since *ajor Holmes' interview and he told me that the Shaikh had informed him that only the following points remained outstanding and that all the rest had been settled:- 1* That any oil found should be piped to Sharjah for export* 2* That the Arabic version of the concession should prevail* 3* An alteration to Article 13* 4* That money paid by the Shaikh by the Company will not be refunded for any reason* 5* That flog of the Shaikh should be flawn at the fields* 6* That such guards as the Shaikh considers suitable are to be appointed by him* 7* That correspondence between the Shaikh and Company tc b 'n Arabic. 8* That tiifc Shaikh’s London representative should be one whom the Shaikh selects even if he does not know aomkiny English* 9* Drilling to commence within five years of dote of signature* 10* The question of the intial and yearly payment to be settled* Before the Residency Agent had left me, the Secretary to the Shaikh came to the Rest House and told us that the Shaikh had forgotten one other point which he had not been settled and which was as follows:- That Jabal Fayah and Wadi al Hilu should not be worked until conditions are settled* As /As will be seen only points number 2 and number 9 offer fjiy real difficulty of solution and, in my opinion, even these could be overcome by determined persuaion on the part of the Company’s Hepresentaive* 7* On June 6th Major Holmes had another lengthy interview with the Shaikh of Sharjah and eaw me directly a afterwards* He had a list of amLiendmnts which his clerk read to me* He said he writing to his Company. I expressed surprise that he was not cabling and he said he would cable but would have to write as well* He said that the ammendments were the ones that the Shaikh was holding out over and that he could not agree to them, but had promised to refer to his Company* He said he had told the Shaikh that he was not prepared to pay more for the Sharjah concession than he haul for the Dubai concession* It is worth noting here that he had already told the Shaikh’s Secretary that he would pay Bs*86r.00CA which is Rs *6,000/- more choci he confesses paying at Dubai* He told me that the Shaikh was fright ened and alleged that the • political 1 had frightened him and hinted that if this was not so he would have made more progress* He said fcfe had made no further appointment vd.th the Shaikh* He further stated that he might or might not cable his principals taat day* I said that if he was going to delay matoers by writing and not cabling then I could sea no reason why I should wait and he agreed. The Residency Agent whcm I saw in Major HoImes*spresence confirmed th&amp;v the financial question had not been fdlly discussed and that Major Homes had broken off the discussions to refer to his Company* 8. On the 6th June I suggested to Major Holmes that he should conduct the Ajman negotiation at the same time and he said that he could not as he had had no reply /reply from the Shaikh of Ajman to © letter he had written some eight days previously* I would heve suggested that the Um al ^aiwein negotiation be commenced as weH ? but owing to vbe present situation evening I called at Ajman which is 16 minutes from here and spoke to the Shaikh about the situation* He agreed that he had failed to answer the letter but expressed willingness to see Major Holmes ©ny morning that he liked* I told the Shaikh I would inform the Major Holmes. I did so on the roming of the 6th dune and Major Holmes said he was disinclined to enter into any further negotiations while this one was in progress and that he proposed to deal with Has al Khaimah next* On my pressing him to save time by conducting both the negotiations at the same time, he said that he could not do it* That it was too Jiueh to do* 9 * Major Holmes does not appear anxious to start even preliminary interview with the other neighbouring Shaikhs* He did not appear anxious to coimuence dealings direct with the Shaikh of Shnrjoh and has bwen mentioned the possibilty of extending the option period to the Shaikh* He is coBtemplating taking s house in Sharjah for hie clerk., while 1-e lives at the Rest House* have convinced me lhat either he is no longer capable of carrying on a very trying task &amp;A hot weather or else for some reason which I am unable even to suggest he is not anxious to conclude the negotiations as quickly as possible* there, I thought it better to wait.

D.O.KO. •10/12. Sharjah, 11th| June 1937• There have been a number of interviews between us and they hpve all of them been difficult to follow as Holmes will never consistent in his views for more than two days end some- times for not as long« I believe he is anxious to prolong the negotiation as rmich as possible and Intends to blame the Political for his lack of success* My idea has been and will continue to be to ^rees both parties to reach agreement in the shortest possible space of time* Holmes blames his Company for hindering him by the uncompromising attitude they have adopted regarding the Shaikh 1 a demands but fails to point out that their attitude is in accordance with his recommendations to them* At one period of the conversation he said he had asked for Longrigg to come out to personally conduct the negotiation* Holmes seems very anxious to be out of the whole business for hio won ends* I believe that he is anxious to form a Company of his own to try for Concessions in the Aden Protectorate behind Mukalla* He hopes to have 7556 British and 26 % American Company* 2. I am hoping that whatever pressure I have been able to bring to bear personally and through Khan Sahib •Abdur Rezsaq, who has been most helpful, will result in a considerable advance being made today inspite of Holmes* .onel Bir Trenchard C«Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Uulf, B U S H I H KNote of a conversation between Major Frank Holmes and the Political Agent f Bahrein, on the night of June the 10th 1937• timJiSn Major Holmes came to the Heat House last night in an excitable frame of mind and immediately began accusing the * Political ' of having frightened all the Shaikhs. I asked him what he meant by this statement, but he was unwilling t4 make himself clear. The statement was made in an offensive tone end I pressed him to tell me the source of his information as he said M everyone * had told him n whereever he went ' but he said that he was unwilling to name his informants to me in case harm befell them. I asked him if he considered the * frightening M of the Shaikhs detrimental to his Company's interests. He would not ensv/er clearly but in turn asked my opinion. I told him my opinion was not in question at the moment, but that 1 was anxious for his as 1 wished to keep the Resident informed of the situation. Major Holmes refused to give a definite answer. He then informed me that although he had received a reply from his Company rejecting the Shaikh's demands he was not proposing to inform the Shaikh of his Company's decision. I expressed surprise at this as 1 felt sure that the Shaikh would expect a definite reply especially as he, Holmes, had suax&gt;ended his negotiations to await the Company's reply to the question put to them at the Shaikh's request. He told me that he proposed to endeavour to extend the present period of Option v/ith a view to settling the agreement immediately afterwards, as by this means, he would be able to obtain more money from his Company by paying the Shaikh the amount due on account of the unexpired portion of the option without these money transactions appearing in the actual concession agreement where a large figure might be detrimental to future business /II w*- ' ■ - 2 ««* busiftoco dealings* complained bliftrerly that the generous terms of the Qatar Concession had put prices up all round# I told Holrues that I did not follow business methods but felt that firm negotiation and a rise in the financial terns originally suggested would result in a concluded Concession agreement in Sharjah# 2. I told Holmes that X had seen the Shaikh of Um- al ~ Q&amp;iwain that morning, June lCth 5 on a Political matter and was surprised to learn from him that he had never received a copy of the draft Concession agreement# Holmes said th^t he had never sent him one nor hod he sent one to Ajraan and no intention of sending either of them copies and tliat he could not understand why I was surprised# I told him I was surprised as he liaa himself assured me that all the Shaikhs had copies of the proposed agreements# Holmes denied ever hi ving made such a statement and said that I always seemed to misunderstand him# I said apparently I had on several occasions such as at Dubai before the Concession agreement was signed, when 1 asked him in the presence of the assembled Shaikhs and witnesses if all was in order with the agreement from his Company's point of view and he had stated that as far as the Company was concerned all was in order# He said that he must be pezmltted -ed to negotiate in his own way and not be hindered by Political complications and that the recent action at tin - al - Qaiwain had frightened the Shaikhs# I pointed out to him that no one wished to hamper his negotiations but tliat although a number of matters requiring attention had been allowed to remain in abeyance so that hie negotiat ions would not be disturbed, it was not possible to refrain from action in all cases and that on this occasion any action that had been taken had, in zny opinion, rather advanced than retarded his interests# X further pointed out that his change of attitude was difficult to understand as he hud stated, after the Vubzi. agreement was signed, th*'* if /*&gt; 3 • r if a Political Officer had not come down then it would never have been signed end that the last thing he wanted to happen , was for me to return as hia chances at Sharjah and Raa-al- Khaimph would be very much lessened thereby# He asked me if I was still of opinion that the Shaikh of Sharjah was not influenced by his relatives, and I said yes that the only person that had any influence was his Secretary, Abdullah bin Faria# lie asked my opinion of the other shaikhs and how far they were influenced by their relatives# I told him that Abu JJhabl was | probably f influenced by his uncle t Shaikh Khalifah, and the leading merchant, Ahmad bin Khalsf, who had recently arrived in Dubai, that AJman was not influenced by anyone, that Uta ~ rl - r^iwain had a strong body of relativee and advisers to dead with and was very much under their influence in external matters, that Aas - al - Khc&gt;imah was influenced by a Qudhi, ho was, 1 believed, from wcjd# I then informed him of the present situation in Ras-al- Khalmah# In answer to an enquir/ fi'om me, he told me that he had had a favourable reply from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi# As he said that he received this reply by the hand of Ahmad bin Khalaf, I have sent the Residency Agent to Dubai to obtain first hand information of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's reactions to Holmes' letter# 3# In answer to a leading remark of Holmes, 1 told him that in a case where speed was essential as it was in this instance, it was to me difficult to understand the present intentions of the Company# They started negotiations with Sharjah when the Ras-al-Khaimah Option expired first and had refrained from informing the other shaikhs with their terms to consider, while other negotiations were in progress nor was it their intention u&gt; do so until they actually com enced negotiating with them and that the /bu Dhabi negotiation had been /been held up by a peculiar misunderstanding and delaying of letters* 4* Holmes asked if his Secretary Aehraf should leave the house of ilsis Hesan, ana I said that^the less he was mixed up with Hals Hasan, the better# I had on two previous occaisions warned Holmes of the danger of conducting his negotiations through this individual and he told me that he had given up all contact with him long ago and that his Secretary had nothing u&gt; do with him* I had recently learnt thct HolDies* ^ecx*etary has been and still is living with Rais Hasan* 5* Later in Uie evening Holmes told me that the Secretary to the Shaikh of Sharjah had said that he wished to see him before he interviewed the Shaikh anu asked if 1 thought that he would be advised to see die man# I said cert? inly as presumably the man had some conumnication to n^dce either on his own or his master's behalf, and it would be as well to kno* what it was before he saw the Shaikh* 1 told him that the Shaikh would certainly know of his Secretary's Intention to visit him, and that Uiei^e could be no objection from the Shaikh's point of view, as he had appointed his Secretary in uhe first instance as his negotiator* I further told Holmes ttiat 1 thought he should in any case see the Shaikh in person in the afternoon if he received the Secretary in the morning* Sharjah, 11th, June 1937# Captain, Political Agent,Bahrain*Translation of letter dated the 12th June 1937 equivalent to the 2nd Rabi* ath-Thf ni 1356 from Shaikh Sa'ld bin llaktumi O.B.E*.

About the middle of September 1937 the Shaikh received a letter from &amp;ajji *Abdullah in which he wrote about oil and promised to send a motor car to the Shaikh. The Shaikh wrote a letter to Hajji ’Abdullah which he sent to ’Abdur Rahman Falknaz, his agent at Dubai, for despatch by airmail to Basrah. The Representative \ letter was sent by mistake to th^agMOt of the Petroleum Concessions at Dubai. Since then no letter was received from the Hajji. cc/t Residency Agent,Sharjah,Confidential, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department. EXPRESS LETTER • [N.
