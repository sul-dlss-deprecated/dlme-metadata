[His Majesty's Government] to contract engagements on behalf of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf in International Agreements': note by External Department, India Office, dated April 1946. The note discusses the question of the right of the British Government to speak on behalf of Koweit [Kuwait], Bahrein [Bahrain], Qatar, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms in the light of:(1) the Chicago Air Agreements;(2) the recent Petroleum Agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States;(3) the Bretton Woods Agreements.The conclusion is that in order to maintain the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (excluding Muscat) as British protected states, the British must from time to time undertake international obligations on their behalf and see that the states themselves fulfil such obligations.The document has an annex by Sir Charles Geoffrey Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, containing his views on the question, dated 27 September 1945.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00002c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
