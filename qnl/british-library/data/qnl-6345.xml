To. Major S. G.'Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, Persian Gulf.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Ris Majesty's Secretary of State for India. m Stmt,a, the 12th September 1907. 9 Sir, ( We have the honour to forward herewith a copy of correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of two acts of serious and brutal piracy committed by Arabs residing at Dayir, a place on the coast of Persia about 100 miles south of Pushire. 2. In November 1906,* the pirates attacked a native boat belonging to the Persian port of Shivoh between Keis * ride enclosure No. 6. island and Taona. They killed all the crew except one boy who escaped after being left for dead, and seized the cargo which was valued at Rs. b,UUU. In January 1907,t the pirates captured a Koweit boom, sailing from Basrah to Koweit. After murdering the crew and passengers who numbered 29, they carried oif the cargo and abandoned the boom which was subsequently found stranded on the island of Amair. 3 The Political Resident made representations on ttie subject of the first piracy to the Derya Begi, but as they produced no result he telegraphed to the Minister at Tehran and informed him of what had happened. At the same time he requested the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf to proceed to T) a yir, and make enquiries. The local authorities at Dayir, when _ questioned bv 'Captain Bowman, denied all knowledge of the piracy, but from information subsequently received it appears that, on the very day when the Sphinx called at Dayir, the Chief of the pirates was in Dayir and was staying with the Khan of that place. On the 16th of June 1907, His Majesty’s Minister a v informedJ the Resident that he could hold t ride enclosure No. 4. 0ut nQ k 0 p es that useful action would he taken by the Persian Government in the matter at present. 4 It is true that in the first case the victims were Persian subjects and that it might he supposed that the Persian Government would themselves take steps to secure redress for their own subjects from the pirates residing within “L correspondence ending with y onr Secret their jurisdiction. The British Govern, despatch No. 2 , duted the 1st February lyo?. ment have, however, acknowledged§ a general obligation for the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf, and it is their object to secure the suppression of piracy in Gulf waters It would, therefore, in our opinion, be our duty, even if British interests or the interests of British-protected persons were not primarily concerned, to take all possible action with a view to scattering the Dayir gang. And in the case of the second offence we consider that we are under a special obligation in this instance, because some subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit to whom we are bound, under ,1 Secret de.pa.ch No. 35 (E.te.oai), the Agreement^ of 23rd January 1899, to dated the 23rd February 1899. extend OUF good offices^ have been robbed and murdered bv the pirates.2 e*r ^ \V 5. We would, accordingly, venture to recommend that a strong represent ation should be made to the Persian Government with a view to secure the capture and punishment of the offenders and full pecuniary reparation for the sufferers in the Koweit case. In view of the offence committed against their own subjects the Persian Government should presumably be only too ready to co-operate with us against the offenders. But as it appears certain that no representations to the Persian authorities, whether made locally or at Teliran, are likely either to secure satisfaction for the offences which have been committed or to prevent a recurrence of such crimes in the future, we would suggest that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government within a stated time, suitable naval action will be taken at Dayir. 6. If our proposal is approved, it is quite possible that, in order to clear out the pirates, it may be necessary for the naval authorities not only to enter Persian territorial waters but also to land men on the Persian coast. We are aware that the Persian Government in 1903, with reference to an encounter between certain pirates, who had organised a surprise attack on Koweit, and the sailors of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ”, protested against the adoption of this course, * Vide despatch from the Marquess of Lansdowne but the Minister at Tehran Was On toSirA. Hardinge, n°. 44 , datedthe^h Apn! 19 03 . ^hat occasion directed* by His Majesty’s Government to inform the Persian Government that the Commanders of H. M.’s ships, whilst they would always be careful to respect the sovereign rights of Persia and to co-operate to the utmost of their ability with the local authorities, must, in the absence of any effective Persian naval force, retain their freedom to take at their discretion and on their responsibility, even within Persian territory, such measures for the repression of piracy, as the urgency or gravity of any particular case might seem to them to warrant. The Persian Government were reminded that the security from pirates enjoyed by the population both on the Persian and opposite Arab coasts was entirely due to the past efforts of the British navy, and they were informed that the British Government had entered into special compacts on this subject with the Trucial Chiefs, and that they could not engage to give any new orders to the Commanders of British vessels which would tend to restrict the efficiency of their action in maintaining the maritime peace in the Gulf. It was also pointed out that the Persian Government’s demand was hardly consistent with the fact that in 1897, with the object of suppressing the traffic in arms, they had given permission for His Majesty’s steamships to search merchant vessels in Persian waters and to confiscate any arms and ammunition intended for Persian ports which might be found on board. 7. In Marchf 1901, the claim of the British Government to take t vide correspondence forwarded with Political measures even on Persian territory for Secretary’s letter No. 15, dated the 8th April 1904. suppression of piracy WaS 0006 more enforced, when Sir N. O’Conor reported to the Marquess of Lansdowne that a serious case of piracy on the Shatt-el-Arab had been perpetrated on a British Indian sailing vessel laden with dates. He stated that His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah had reason to believe that the stolen property was hidden in the pirates’ huts at Abkatch on the Khor Hindian Persian coast of the Shatt-el-Arab, and suggested that the “ Lapwing ” then at Koweit should be instructed to search the place. Instructions were issued to the Commander of H. M. S. &lt;c Lapwing ” and a search was accordingly made in Persian territory, but without success. 8 . In view of these precedents His Majesty’s Government would doubtless not be disposed to consider any protest that the Persian Government might make regarding action taken by us against the pirates, and naval action in an outlying part of Persian territory on the Gulf, with the active assistance or consent of the Persian authorities, ought not unduly to excite the susceptibi lities of other powers. 9. The most cogent reason in favour of immediate action in the present case ♦ , at o ^ t is to be found in the fact that the Sheikh l Vide enclosures Nos. 3 and 5. p i -« u. ^ ot Ja.ow 61 u lias asked + witli reference to the piracy committed on his subjects that the Government of India will concur in his employing a heavily armed dhow to protect his vessels plying between Koweit or Basrah and Persian ports.We consider that this proposal should be negatived, since if the Sheikh, with our consent and assistance, despatched an armed dhow to parade the Gulf, the Turks might regard it as a symptom of his growing independence, and they might complain of a disturbance of the status quo. Again, the Persian Government might consider the move to he a sinister one, especially * F»c?e our Secret despatch No. isoj (External), having regard to the fact that Mubaiak dated the 5th September 1907 . hag recently rendered* armed assistance to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Pinally, the policing of the Persian Gulf by Mubarak would amount to an infringement of our prerogative, and therefore in accordance with established policy could not be allowed. .'But it is evident that, if we were to forbid the Sheikh to take steps for the protection of his subjects, and were at the same time to take no effective steps ourselves, we should inevitably arouse his resentment. On'the other hand, if we succeeded in securing reparation for the attack on Mubarak’s subjects, this fact would afford an important demonstration of our will and power to protect his interests. We should thus, while confirming the Sheikh’s allegiance to us, conclusively establish our claim to protect his subjects whether in Persia or elsewhere. We trust, therefore, that the adoption of the measures proposed in paragraph 5 of this letter may be authorised.

It is now surmised that these 2 men ma^ have conspired with the crew of another 'bellum' belonging to Curb ah people from whom, it is said, the nakho.da had purchased some fruit before leaving n owe it and who also knew about the cash and provisions Saleh al Hajri was taking. The 'bollum', it is said, left Koweit about the same time as the pirated boom sailed. The piracy was probably committed during the night when all m board were asleep and when probably one if the gsix Doragh sailors was on the watch. A Kowe.it boat has brought news to Sheikh Mobarak and reports going up to the pirated boom and finding no men or property on board; both the boom and her joll^ boat had holes made in them and the biom was at anchor 1 ^ lag on her side awash. Sheikh Mobarak has written to Sheikh Khazal ana others to trace the offenders and has sent another boat to bring in the pirated boom to Koweit.

(6nSir/arily, as the GovernmentIndia are aware, one of the three subsi dised vessels of His Majesty's Navy remains in the North at this season for the protection of the pearling industry. This year I w r as in the hope that the pro pinquity of the vessel usually deputed to the Shatt-al-Arab for the date export season in August or September w'ould suffice for all purposes, and that it might not be necessary to detach another vessel from Arms Traffic duty in the South. On enquiry, however, from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, I learn that Government have decided that the deputation of one of His Majesty’s ships to the Shatt-al-Arab for the protection of British Indian sailing craft is not considered necessary this season. 4 . I am already in communication with His'Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, regarding two milder cases of piracy on Persian vessels near the^ Shatt-al-Arab Bar, and therefore regret from my own point of view that the^ decision has been taken this year ; in any case it will not now be safe in my opinion to leave the whole of the northern portion of the Gulf for the next few months without the presence of one of His Majesty’s ships, and as soon as H. M. S. “ Redbreast ” arrives and I hear her report I propose to confer with the Senior Naval Officer as to what can be done to meet our requirements with least prejudice to the Arms blockade operations. I will inform Government of India the result. Enclosure No. i.

With reference to the entry in my diary for week ending 6th July reporting the piracy committed on a Kuwait boom I attach as a Note to this letter the further details gathered. 2. The piracy seems to have been well planned and carried out in a most thorough and cold-blooded manner for even at this date (a fortnight after the occurrence) no trace has been obtained either of the missing men or of the sus pected helium. 3. The Shaikh is still making secret enquiries on the Shatt-al-Arab and something may result therefrom in the future. In the meanwhile I would venture to suggest that the presence of a British man-of-war (if one can be spared from the Arms Traffic operations) in the river or a cruise from the pearl-banks to Kuwait and the Shatt-al-Arab would do much to allay the apprehensions caused by this incident and would probably deter other lawless spirits who, emboldened by the present success, may contemplate similar excursions. It may be men tioned in this connection that no man-of-war has visited Kuwait since the 7th October 1909 and I believe the Flag has not been shown in the river since last November. Note on a piracy on a Kuwait boom in July 1910. I asked Shaikh Mubarak about the piracy to-day and the following are the facts . 1 Saleh al Hajri left Kuwait in the afternoon of Tuesday the 28th June to join the pearling fleet. There were besides himself, one Baghdadi passenger • Al Daura rear Maamra on Turkish side of taking tobacco for sale, and 6 sailors of Shatt-al-Arab. P. z. c. whom one was a Doragh* man. Saleh had on board some Rs. 5,000 in cash with which to buy pearls, 32 half-bags of rice, some bags coffee and a lot of dates all for sale among the pearling fleet. *3 The same afternoon a helium from up the river also left Kuwait in the same direction. This helium was manned by Kasba and Maniauni people. It is presumed that there was collusion between the helium and the Doragh sailor with Saleh al Hajri, who knew what his master was carrying. On Wednesday the 29th a Bahrain boat sighted Hajri’s hoom at anchor in 13 fathoms of water and a w r ash off Ras Al Ijleiah (Qaliyah on map), went up to it and found there was nobody on board, but there were some spent Martini bullets on the deck, a few splashes of blood, and the boom stripped of her con tents except a bag or two of dates and rice in the bottom. Her sailing and other gear were intact but one anchor was missing and she had a small hole stove in her bottom as also had the jolly boat belonging to her. They took the sails and the joilly boat for identification purposes to Kuwait as they failed to clear the water out of the hoom^ though several efforts were made. The Shaikh then sent another boom to bring her in. On arrival in Kuwait some more bullets were found embedded in the wood work and her weather-board or gunwale on the star-board side smashed ap parently having been charged down by the attacking bellum. The Shaikh has sent off spies up river to try and trace if the bellum has returned there and to find out if the Doragh sailor is still alive. He also sent men on thaluls to search the beach as far as Ras Safaniya for any bodies or clothing which may be washed ashore. So far no trace of the men who sailed in the boom has been discovered. I inspected the boom in Kuwait and saw the bullet-marks, smashed gunwale, and hole in her bottom. She is a very old boat and the hole in her bottom looks as it has been made with a crow*bar or some such instrument. It is presumed the boojn was anchored for the night when attacked as the spot at which she was found is not more than about 3 or 4 hours’ sail from Kuwait.

The boy has given out that they were in all 14 men «jt*o m the be Hum and has given their names and particu- /i lars of their residences. It is said that the pirate be Hum preceded the Koweit boom and had anchored at n Meadilga.rh v a short distance from Koweit town^where t.hnv rot their guns etc ready for the intended attack. In the meantime the Koweit^had gone out of the harbour and when she was quite out of Koweit the^ be Hum xuikw followed her and opened fire which was returned by the 'boom* 4 but unf ortunately their stock of cartridges was small and therefore could not hold out very long. The bellum then came along side and the pirates boarddd her mudering all those were alive. A few of the sailors of the boom jumped in the sea and tried to escape but were phased in a small boat and fired on and killed. There /C were also 2 snail • !, to al°o had jumped in the sea • They were caugnt alive aid tied together with a stone aid drowned alive. Those that died in the boom, it is said, were also tied into twos and drowned with iron chains,anchors and stones tied to them. When all were killed the pirates looted the boom of her contents and left the boom alone. It is said that some few days ago the pirate \ .Nakhoda sent one of his khalasis to Koweit with s om&amp;j y of the looted goods for sale at Koweit a/id to find out thereby whether the Koweit people were still making enquiries about the pirated 'boom. The goods were identified as belonging to the pirated Vo on as there were marks and names of Koweit merchants on them. The matter was reported to the bheikh b^ his secret spies but nothing was done and the khalasi was allowed to sell the goods / peaceably and return to up river. And now the kha Nakhoda himself came to Koweit with Ghi, fat and rice for sale m Koweit thinking probably that as his khalasi had successfully sold goods and i returned without raising any suspicions^the enquiries about the pirated boom had br-en finally closed. The ha Sheikh had, it is said, given instructions to the Customs Contractor to arrest the pirate ITakhoda and his be Hum as soon as he comes in. then the nakhoda was arrested it is said, he became quite pale and / asked for water to drink. He is now in chains cut the boy cook has been allowed freedom but is being guarded. The Sheikh has promised him not to punish if he gave out all details of the occurrence and to give him a reward also. The boy says that hejias had no hand m the case as when the beirjm^ji**t along side of the boom he was doing his cooking work while his other comrades boarded the boom aid the murderous work.rt / c No. 2397 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 4th (received I2th) September 1910.

It is satisfactory to find that the identity of the pirates has been estab- With reference to your letter No. 2018, dated the 26th July 1910, I have the honour to report that in spite of all Shaikh Mubarak’s efforts nothing has yet been discovered of the perpetrators of the murders and piracy on the Kuwait “ boom ” belonging to Saleh al Hajri. 2. The Shaikh informed me that the “bellum” originally suspected has been found to be innocent, as also six other boats from the Shatt-el-Arab, whose Na- khudas, owing to Shaikh Khazal’s help, Shaikh Mubarak has been able to inter rogate. Nor has anything been gleaned from enquiries southwards beyond the fact that the pirate Ahmad bin Salman accompanied by a crew of Bani Hajir Arabs had started out. This notorious pirate is reported to have made no ex cursion to the north, and to have recently retreated to some lair near Katif; it is said he proposes to confine his efforts to the Katif and Katar coasts and the vicinity of Ojair. To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the With reference to my letter No. 437, dated the 6th August 1910, I have the honour to report that evidence has been obtained by Shaikh Mubarak which it is hoped will lead to the early apprehension of the perpetrators of the piracy on the Kuwait “ boom ” belonging to Saleh al Hajri, and that two of the culprits are already in the Shaikh’s prison awaiting trial. 2. It appears that the Shaikh’s secret enquiries on the river led to suspicion being directed to a certain “ bellum ” which frequently trades between the Shatt- el-Arab and Kuwait. The Nakhuda and most of the crew were known in Kuwait and a watch was accordingly kept on their movements. One or two of the crew visited Kuwait some weeks ago apparently to ascertain if the excitement caused by the piracy had died down and whether enquiries were still being made. The Shaikh allowed them to leave without taking any immediate steps in the hope that confidence might bring the Nakhuda or others to Kuwait.

Both the men were apprehended and confined separately. At nrst both denied all connection with the piracy, but eventually the younger man, Zahir, agreed to turn informer if promised a pardon. This the Shaikh granted and the 'story the informer gave is as follows :— The Nakhuda of the “ bellum ” Sahaim bin Qaid, when visiting ^Kuwait, became aware of what Saleh al Hajri proposed taking in his boom to the pearl*banks and the probable date of his sailing. He planned the piracy and accordingly sailed back to the river to pick up arms and ammunition at Rabthda near Saniya. Having done this he brought the bellum back and remained sailing about to the south of Falaikha Island on watch until Saleh a Hajn’s “ boom ” should set out. Saleh al Hajri sailed on the 28th June in the afternoon and on perceiving her the pirate “bellum ' made off on an eastward tack as if to clear Falaikha Island for the Persian coast, then with the advantage of weather position suddenly veered round and sailed down on the Kuwait &lt;( boom’' She reached her some time after noon on the following day, the 29th June, off Ras al Ijlaieh and ^an her down amidships, her crew firing at those on board the “ boom. Most ot the latter were shot on board and the rest jumped over board to save themselves but were pursued in a dinghy and shot in the water, no one being left alive. i he pirate crew then removed everything in the Kuwait f ‘ boom ” to their own vessel and scuttled her as already reported. The pirate “ bellum ” went off and sheltered some days up the Bahmishir River and eventually got back to the Shatt-el-Arab after her crew had gradually disposed of the loot which had already been shared. 4. The informer gave the names of the pirate crew and where they were to be found and the Shaikh has sent to try and apprehend them. c The names of the men murdered in the Kuwait “ boom ’ and those of the pirate crew as hitherto ascertained are given in the annexure attached hereto. 6 I am informed by the Shaikh that the pirates are all Shiah Arabs of the Cha’ab tribe under the authority of Shaikh Khazal, though their present residence is on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and so in Turkish territory. The Shaikh anticipates no difficulty in dealing with them, however, on this score as the men are w r ell known in Kuwait and Mohammerah and there is no chance of their claiming to be Turkish subjects, their position being analogous to a large number of Shaikh Khazal’s subjects who for purposes of date-tillage reside in Turkish territory. The Shaikh is endeavouring to secure further evidence by recovering some of the looted property. At present there is only the informer’s story and marks on the “ bellum ” which show she has charged another vessel with some consi derable force.

I asked him to make careful enquiries in regard to the latter point, and to report to me if he could obtain definite proof in the matter. 3. hr. Lobo told me that the Turxs considered Salih to be a subject of theirs, but his farrash in r^ply to my enquiries admitted that Salih’s wife lived in Qasbat-al-Aassar, and that he and his father wore boro there.

No. 2743, dated Bushire, tlie 9th (received 17th) October 1910. From Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Mr. S. H. Butler, C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In amplification of my telegram No. 941 of today’s date, I have the honour to forward a copy of Captain Shakespear’s report. 2. I thoroughly sympathise with the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in this piracy question. On the one hand Shaikh Mubarak has brought to bear a ^ u r lof in S enuit y an d money in the endeavour to run these pirates to earth, while Shaikh Khazal has done his utmost so far to act up to his obligations. From the outset I have urged on him, and His Majesty’s Consul has repeatedly pressed the advice, the great importance of not giving the Turkish authorities at Basrah the slightest pretext for accusing him of failure to co-operate, and although it must have gone greatly against the grain, he seems to have honestly endeavoured to respond to our exhortations and. to work in with the Wali. • r ® su ^’ or a k. s ence of result, is only another instance of the disingenuous attitude of the Turkish authorities towards him ; ready enough to accuse him of various malpractices and to build up a record against him in Constantinople, but always failing in their own obligations when any serious concrete need for effective action on their part presents itself. 3. I hope the frequent appearance of H. M. S. Redbreast in the Shatt-el- Arab lately, and outside, will have a sobering effect on the piratical fraternity, but unless the river and the bar are regularly patrolled during the date export season just commenced, we shall be lucky if we get through it without the occur rence of further cases of piracy. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 519, dated the 24th August 1910, regarding the piracy by Shatt-al-Arab Arabs on a Kuwait “ boom ” last June. 2. In a recent conversation Shaikh Mubarak informed me that Shaikh Khazal had been able to apprehend only one more of the men concerned, Saleh of the A1 Maruf residing at Gasbah, and that he now had this man in custody in Kuwait. 3. The Shaikh also related that Shaikh Khazal could do no more as the Turkish officials would not surrender the other culprits who were living in Turkish territorv having already questioned the arrest of Saleh. Shaikh Mubarak seemed to consider it was incumbent on the British representative at Basrah to obtain the surrender of the remaining men for the reason that the piracy and murder had been committed on the high seas, where the British Government took upon itself to maintain peace and order. He pointed out—and there is considerable'truth in the argument—that if some of the murderers, whose names are now all known and who are recognised as subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, escape punishment by sheltering in Turkish territory with the cognizance of Turkish officials niranv will No. C.-57, dated Kuwait, the 20th September 1910.% X ') the culprits and consequently perhaps feels rather sore and disappointed at being unable to lay them by the heels. '4. In my humble opinion Shaikh Mubarak's attitude can hardly be called unreasonable in view of the undoubted fact that all native craft plying these waters, and indeed as far up the Shatt al-Arab as Mohammerah or Basrah, whether for pearl diving, carrying date-produce or in the ordinary course of trade, trust implicitly to the security afforded by years of the policework of His Majesty’s ships. In my recent tour along the pearl-banks this implicit trust that all craft were perfectly safe even without weapons w r as frequently brought very forcibly to my notice, and it seems to me that there is a danger of that confidence in our will, if not in our power, to maintain the security of these waters, being shaken. Though the danger may probably not be immediate, it is significant that the non-apprehension of the perpetrators of this particular piracy should be discussed in the way related, and it requires but a few similarly successful excursions on the part of such lawless spirits for the danger to become a reality. It is for this reason that I have ventured to lay the matter before you in some detail in the hope that some means may be devised to bring about either the surrender of the culprits for trial bn Kuwait or their adequate punishment by Turkish authorities. 5. Shaikh Mubarak has furnished me with the names of four more persons ascertained to have been concerned in the piracy; details regarding them are given in the annexure to this letter. , 6 . His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah furnished me with a copy of his letter No. 962 of the 2nd September 1910 to your address on the same subject, in which he puts forward the difficulties from the Mohammerah point of view. As he very truly remarks the bond fides of the Turkish officials are open to grave suspicion, and it is this fact which hampers both Shaikhs in all their dealings with them. Unless the Wali of Basrah or the Qaimaqam at Fao can control the Turkish side of the river in some more efficient fashion than is exposed by paragraph 6 of Captain Wilson’s letter it would seem not improbable that their efforts to prevent piracy may have an exactly contrary effect, especially if the men concerned in the Kuwait “ boom ” case find they can go scot-free, secure in their fictitious claim to Turkish nationality. Both Shaikh Khazal and Shaikh Mubarak are vitally interested in preventing piracies on the river, more especially at the present time when date export is commencing. Their co-operation in suppressing piracy and bringing offenders to book may, therefore, be counted upon without question, thus leaving as the only uncertain factor Turkish methods and means, confidence in wdiich is not inspired by the Fao Qaimaqam’s action in regard to Saleh, or the Wall’s support of his subordinate in the matter.

Cox.Telegram P To Foreign No $41 dated 9.10.10 Please see my letter of* 18th September No S529, para 5 of the first enclosure. Owing to the animosity existing between the Wall and Sheikh Mobarak and the Wali’s known attitude regarding the status of Xoweit, I did not think the course suggested by Sheikh Kh.'izal was then advisable 9 or that it would be v-elcomiL. to Sheikh Mobarak. The recall of the Wall has since modified the position and Sheikh Mobarak now names four Eohamnerah subjects living in Turkish limits and suggests that we should demand their surrender to us on thf ground that the niracy took rlace on the high seas, for the security of which we have accepted request. responsibility. The Political Agent Koweit supports this It is calculated to encourage further piracies , and is extremely inexpedient that culprits whose identity has once been ascertained should, on account of quibbles of jurisdic- W/ -tion escape all punishment^/1 favour the Sheikh’s proposal. It would be better if we could demand surrender to ourselves but failing that it seems that The prouder course would bo to press either in Basrah or Constantinople for their surrender to Sheikh rdiazal. If it is decided to take action proposed nleaoe consider whether we should concern ourselves with the after treatment of the surrendered pirates. I should add with reference to the general question that on the first of October Wilson reported that the joint action indicated in para 4 of his letter of 12th Sept, No had fallen through owing to the Turks having taken no action in spite of their promises.No. of 1910 . / British Residency and Consulate-General, Busliire, u October 1910• Copies of tho undei’inentioned telegrams are forwarded with compliments to the Political Agent, ivoweit for information.

The Basrah authorities have made not the slightest attempt to co-ooerate with Sheikh Khaxal in patrolling the lower part of the river and the Sheikh has now given up expectation of their making any, and he begs that we will assist him by keeping one of His majesty’s ships , as at present, patrolling from the outer Bar to -oha.m Hohammerah from time to time.

After anchoring off Has Khafji Mohs in with two of iis Bedouin companions went ashore, but all the boatmen remained in the ships. Mohs in and his companions then bound up the shepherd and while one remained to look after this prisoner, mohsin and the other d'?ov&amp; the sheep some distance down to the sea and loaded them up.

I explained to Sheikh J^sa that as the ^ob- -bery had been committed from the sea, it was an offence of rather a serious nature.

A piracy has been committed off Qatar on a Koweil boat. The pirates took shelter off Ras Naband and are said to have been arrested by Sheikh Sagar of Naband. Can you kindly arrange to send ship to take N-fi^or Agha Bedr on board and proceed to Naband to obtain delivery of culprits whom sheikh is apparently ready to hand over, and take them to Koweit to be handed over to Political Agent for safe custody pending further orders.

News has been received of a piracy, facts of which are as follows A sailing boat (bellam) said to be of Nakhuda Hussain, Koweiti, took a cargo of dat^es recent-ly from Bahrein for Oman ports, where the nakhuda disposed of his dat.es and bought fish and sailed i»o Qatar. After he had sold his fish, he left for Koweit, having on board a crew of 4 Basris, one negro, one Nejdi and his son. On uhe way, the Basris suggested lo ohe Nakhuda to go to sleep as he appeared tired and to allow them to t,ake the rudder. The Nakhuda agreed to this and went to sleep with his son. After they were asleep, one of the Basris attacked the Nakhuda, his son and the Nejdi - one by one -, cut their throais with a knife and threw t,hem into hie sea. The Basris then suggested to the negro that, if he would catch the rudder and .ake the boat to Busreh, they would give him money. The w^nd, however, being against the boat, the negro was obliged to take the vessel to Naiband, a Persian port, where it ap pears no boats make a call. Saggar, the Sheikh of the place on seeing -the boat, sent his men to enquire what had brought it there, when the negro told the Basris that he knew some one there and wished to land. On landing the negro went and re- -ported the facts of the piracy to Sheikh Saggar. The latter sent his men, arrested the Basris and got the boat beached. Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalfan, Chief of Naiband, has since sent the negro to Sheikh Isa bin Ali, Chief of Bahrein, with a letter. The latter has taken down the negro’s statement, and sent it on to Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah together with Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalfan's letter.Fc»r aconsed • ;' i»een then?

It will be seen that the Shaikh of Naband, after reference to his chief, Shaikh Muhammad Ahmad Khalfan of the Harami tribe, readily consented to hand over the culprits to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Lingah, whom I had been able to depute for the purpose, with the co-operation of the Senior Naval Officer, and that the culprits have been taken to Kuwait, where they will remain in the custody of the Political Agent, pending full enquiry and report to me by him. 3. I should not have troubled Government with the record of the case, in its present incomplete state, were it not for the fact that it bears directly upon two matters now under the consideration of Government. Firstly, it is plain that the successful outcome of our action in this matter is due in no small degree to the friendly relations that exist between our repre sentative and the chiefs of the littoral of his district and that, from this point of Residency letter No. 2310, dated 22nd Sep. view, his appointment has not failed to tember 1912, to Foreign Department. yield good results.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to invite a reference to the Kuwait News for the week ending 31st December 1912, regarding a piracy committed on a Kuwait boat: an extract of the news is attached for ready reference. 2. When visiting Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah yesterday he described the murder to me, the details being much as noted in the accompanying extract. The letter of Shaikh Sagar bin Khalfan of Naband village to Shaikh Mubarak has miscarried, but the negro, who was one of the crew and informed the Shaikh of Naband of the outrage and secured the arrest of the murderers, has reachedKuwait and on his information Shaikh Mubarak has rscjucsted me to convey to you his desire that the murderers may be obtained from the custody of the Shaikh of Naband and sent to Kuwait for trial and punishment, together with the “ bellam her gear and Rs. 360 in cash belonging to the murdered men, deposited with the Shaikh of Naband. 3. The men murdered were named Husain bin Ali, nakhoda and owner of the “ bellam ”, his son Ali, and a boatman named Turki: all three were Kuwaitis. The names of the four murderers who formed the crew of the “ bellam ” are Kathair, Mahomed, Safi and Az Zair: these four men are all in custody at Naband. The negro who gave information is named Tarish bin Salim and is from Nejd, though apparently now domiciled in Bahrain: he is present in Kuwait and will remain here pending a settlement of this case. 4 Sir Mubarak-as-Subah urged an earnest appeal that you would be able to secure the transport of the culprits and the “ bellam ” with her property and the cash noted, to Kuwait, for this is the second serious piracy lately committed on Kuwait boats by Shatt-el-Arab men and as the evidence appears to be con clusive, the case offers a good opportunity for some drastic measures which will have a deterrent effect on the piratical proclivities of Shatt-el-Arab Arabs. Extract from Kuwait News for the week ending j/st December IQ12. **••**• News of a piracy off Qatar has been received in Kuwait. The victims are, it appears, one Nakhoda Husein and his son, Kuwaitis, who had left Kuwait in their own “ Bellam ” for Basrah and thence to Qatar with a cargo of dates for sale. After selling the dates they were returning to Kuwait when they were killed as well as a Nejdi passenger by the Basri crew of the “ Bellam ” who coveted their goods and money. After the murder the crew made for the Persian coast and anchored for 3 days off Ras Naband. It is said the Shaikh of the place said to be Shaikh Sagar, finding that they did not communicate with the shore and thinking they were in distress sent men to make enquiries when the helmsman who is reported to be a negro living with the Al-bu-Ainain tribe landed and related the details of the piracy to Shaikh Sagar. The latter is said to have arrested all the men and sent letters to Shaikh Mubarak and Shaikh Isa inform ing them of his action. - Telegram No. 24, dated 5th January 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Senior Naval Officer, Radio, Bushire. A piracy has been committed off Qatar on a Kuwait boat. The pirates took shelter off Ras Naband and are said to have been arrested by Shaikh Sagar of Naband.

I have received from the Head Clerk of the Koweit Politi cal Agenfcy, in the absence of Captain Shakespear, a request to give to Ghulam bin Ali, brother of the murdered Nakhuda, a letter asking the Sheikh of Naband to hand over the ”bel- lam' Ie her gear to him. 3.

If the Sheikh of Naband has not received any compensation and I now order him to hand over the 'be11am' without being able to give him some assurance that his service is not for gotten, I fear it would be damaging to my influence, and causq the Sheikh to place scant reliance in in my promises in the future. By this I allude to my original promise of compensation for his action, and I would make it clear that I have never mentioned to him the matter of being allowed to keep the 'bellam'. 5.

Besides Saif, others in his boat were his nephew Yusuf, one Arab of Bagiidad, named Atdur Re^a, living at Koweit, who was engaged as cook, one Arab of Batinah, named Muhammad, and four Somalis, After selling pearls at Bahrain Saif returned to the banks. On the following night of his departure from Bahrain, when Yusuf had charge of the boat’s tiller and Saif was asleep, Yusuf called one of the Somalis, named All, to take the tiller, so that he might pray. While Yusuf was praying the Somali Ali took Saif’s rifle, which was by his side, and shot him. Saif apparently got up, but, fell back overboard. Yusuf went aft and caught the rifle from the Somali, but, was immediately attacked by the three other Somalis, and, to save his life he jumped into the sea. Some way from the boat he found Saif struggling in the water and caught him by the shoulder. He swam for many hours, supporting Saif, and eventually reached a pearling boat. Saif was then alive, but, died soon after they were pulled up into the boat. The pearl ing boat, which belonged to Ijbail (between Bahrain and Koweit)m 'Z3^ ? Ivoweit)^ took Yusuf there, and fron there lie went to Kcweit hy heat. I, Saleh bin Faleh, was given a letter to Your Honour by Captain Shakespeare and was told to gc tc lingeh to keep a look out for the four Somalis, whom I know and can re cognize, Yusuf, who was going on to Muscat on the same mission, and five others were with me. We left Kcweit by the Mail steamer w Baroda w on the 3^th July, and, soon after our arrival at Lingeh, Yusuf spotted one of the four Somali murderers (named Hassan) coining on board. Police Constable Mir Islam Khan, who was on board with us^ was informed, and we caught the Somali Hassan. Soon after, the three other Somalis came on board and were caught. One of them, named Ali, managed to get away and climbed on to the ship f s awning, from where he jumped into the sea. Mir Islam Khan offered the boatmen around the ship Rs. 5 /- for his capture. The Somali repeatedly dived under the ship, but, was eventually caught by some boat men. All the four Somalis were securely tied up and searched by Mir I*&gt;lan Khan and the Captain of the ship. They found on them Rs, 39V^' 25 in gold, which was given to me with a bundle of their clothing and a pair of Arab shoes.

Recently I had been in Kuwait though I usually live in Bah rein. Last month I joined the bellum of seif bin Rumi at Jin- nah to go to Kuwait. There was 3eif bin Rumi and Yusuf bin Hussein Rumi, myself, and the Baghdadi cook Abdur Rezak and 4 Somalis on board. The bellum came to Bahrein first and we stop ped here a day and a night and then set sail the next night for Kuwait. The wind was shamal; the next night but one at 4 or 5 Arabic I don’t know the time, but in the dead of night , I was woken by the noise ofshot. 1 and the cook and Yusuf were sleeping forward and the Somalis and seif wer aft«&gt;ltoen I woke I saw the nakhuda had been shot in the chest and one ofVsomalis had a rifle. The nakhuda and Yusuf who had rushed to his as sistance both sprang into the sea, and I did not see anything more of them. Nothing more happened that night but in the morning the Somalis questioned the cook and me • They asked us if we should prefer to be shot or thrown into the^oea with a plank. We chose the latter alternative. We were given a plank and pushed into the sea. They gave us 2 small glasses of water in a leather buckets, no food. We were dropped on Friday and the following Friday I saw the boat of Ghulam Haider and was picked up. We did not see any boats at all in the meanwhile. The cook died about noon of the Fridayvthe very day Ghulam Haider’s boat appeared. I was in a bad condition drinking sea water when picked up. R.O. &amp; A.G. Bahrein. The,18th August 1913 Sd. A.P.

On the 27th I sailed for my home in ^ashti, and on the 28th Shaban I iaw something in the water, and on going up to i£,I found it was the man now in Court, Muhammed Batini on a plank about a foot and half wide. He was under water up to his ohest. The place was a long way from either shore nearly the middle of the Gulf. Muhammad 1 s head and body and legs were all swollen. was practically senseless, Just murmuring 'Shima, Shima ,, . I took him out of the sea and took him to my home in Ziarat Dashti and looked after him for 20 days and now as I was coming to Bahrein I brought him here. Several people know the man including Khalifah bin Mubarak who is putting him up now. When he got better in my house in Dashti he told me about his adventures. He said he had engaged in a bellum belonging to Seif bin Rumi Kuwaiti, with a crew of Somalis and a Baghdadi cook. The Somalis one night attacked and killed the Nakhuda • Afterwards they said to the Baghdadi cook and Muhammed you are to be shot or thrown in the sea whichever you like. They chose the sea and were thrown in with a plank. After some days the cook died, and Muhammed alone was left, when I found him. R.O. &amp; A.O Bahrein. Sd.

Now if there men were paupers it would not matter but every ohe icnows that one of the men is rent by the r 'heikh and the others are from the house of Bir '“aif, one of the leading and wealthier ten of Kuwait. I do not know if Kuwait people value their own reputation or otherwise but in my opinion it would be better to their credit if your Honour were to order the despatch to me of the amount of the advance, &amp;.800/-, before the post leaves in order that I may be able to remit the amount to Lingah as early as po^:ible.

M ! a Consul, K 0 W E I T ^ o Sir \ In continuation of vay letter No. 333; dated the lit': Septeraber 1913 , I have the honour to infcr.i you that A^ha Ali 1 ^ mibfaion tc Kalat and Jir^a, accompanied 'by tlie Koweitib Ah^ied bin Ha&amp;ban and Abdullah bin Hawaiian and the Somali Haaban bin Muharimad, has proved very buccebb- ful, and he hab managed to recover practically all the money hidden by the Somalis, and also\the money taken by the negro of Jirza, named Haji Walaidoo. 2_* A^'lia Ali left here on the 10th September and bailed direct to the »pct between Kalat and Jirza, where it wab tnought the money was hidden, but, the Somali proved to have completely forgotten the lie of the land, and, al though he b bowed a genuine deb ire to find the spot, he could not do bo. The party bailed up and down the coast between Jirza and Chiru for two days without buceess, when Agha Ali decided to put in at Kalat, and, if pcs Bilie, to abcertain the exact c^ot, where the Bellam had first been beached, and from where it waa taken tc Kalat. Shaikh Ibrahim of Kalat offered every absibtance, and, two men, who professed to know where t'-e 'bellam” was found, conducted Agha Ali to the apot between Kalat and Chiru. The Somali was taken ashore, and he then recog nised the place and unearthed two separate lotb of money, aggregating R*. 1772 /-. The two Kalatis who pointed out the place were given presents of Rs.-l^/- each. 2* Agha All then went tc Jirza and confronted the negrone^ro Hajl Walaidoo of having exhort«d a lar^ft afam AT rnoney from the Sonalib. He btoutly denied the charts, hiit, from hi fa attitude A^ha Ali fathomed t'iat he wab guilty. Trie man was threatened, cut, he would bay nothing; and, A^iia Ali returned to Ko-lat* Shaikh Ihrahiia of Kalat al^o held tl'iat it wab inocbbible for hifa t nib ted fa lave Haji Walaidoo to he guilty, h , ut, he offered every abbistance, and accompanied A^ha Ali hack to hi '-sia. Walaidoc v/ab threatened, hut, he and other people of Jiraa / held btcutly to their denial of knowing anything of the Sc ia3fc. The fort at Jirza, where Valaidoc lived, wab thoroughly earched and the only money found wab a sum of Rs. loO/-, which, Walaidoo,who io Kalantur of Jirza, was known to have lately collected from the inhabitants as revenue. Walaidoo’s denial and the Shaikh’s disbelief were so btrong that A w ha Ali v;as on the point of abandoning fur ther enquiry, when he fortunatel 2 r thought of searching Walaidoo’s private house in the village. Thib wab done thoroughly and from the floor a bum of Rb. 4^7 was re covered! Shaikh Xcraiiim was so furious tuat b.e wanted ‘jO kill Walaidoo on the spot, -'ith his own hand, but, was prevented by Agha Ali. WalaidOO then confessed everything and it was found that other people of Jirza were also im plicated, and altogether a sum of Rs. 17&gt;0/- and 8 overeigns was recovei'ed from various people. The Somali contended that W&amp;XXX&amp;®® Walaidoo took Rb. l 600 /- and 1? sovereigns, but, Agha Ali could not manage to force more out of them t}ian the sum mentioned. Walaidoo was further •nude to disgorge a small parcel containing 11 pearls, and confessed to having sold the large pearl to a merchant at Qais, named Muhammad Salman. The 4 Abb&amp;hs and the blister pearl could not be traced, and, as the Somali said he did not remember Walaidoo having taken these, it was not pressed. 4. Agha Ali then proceeded to Q,aia and found that Muhammad J^ RO'V a Hindu, Muhainoiad Salman had no Id the large pearl to naned Takumal, for Ra. 200 /-, who took it to Bahrain and ooId it to a Hindu there, named Dhaiaanmal Maghumal, for Rb • 224/-. I have arranged to recover Rts. 200 /- from Shaikh Ihrahim of Kalat on account of thib pearl ,/and on receipt the bum v/ill he remitted to you, I would mention that Shaikh Ibrahim of Kalat it&gt; a t’' 0 roughly trubtworthy person, di^pcaed to oe very friendly with thia Vice-Consulate, and, that he was in ix- way implicated in the matter of Walaidoo’a rreedineaa ani that he ha a promised to punish him and the other peoxjle of Jirza very severely for their crime. The following is a list of what Agha All recovered, which has been handed over to Ahmed bin Hassan, whose re ceipt is attached herewith:- Rs« — As•—Ps, Recovered by the Somali, money buried between Kalat and Chi ua 1772'“ 0-- 0 Recovered from Walaidoo and others of J i r 2 »a * ... *♦* ••• . . . . 1 t &gt; 0 -- 0 — 0 -Bo. - (£.
