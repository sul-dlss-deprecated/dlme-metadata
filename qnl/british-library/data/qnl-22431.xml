IV STATEMENT REGARDING SILVER The problems confronting some nations as a result of the wide fluctuation in the value of silver were the subject of serious discussion in Commission III. Due to the shortage of time, the magnitude of the other problems on the agenda, and other limiting considerations, it was impossible to give sufficient attention to this problem at this time in order to make definite recommenda tions. However, it was the sense of Commission III that the subject should merit further study by the interested nations. V LIQUIDATION OF THE BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference Recommends : The liquidation of the Bank for International Settlements at the earliest possible moment. VI ENEMY ASSETS AND LOOTED PROPERTY ^ Whereas, in anticipation of their impending defeat, enemy leaders, enemy Nationals and their collaborators are transferring assets to and through neutral countries in order to conceal them and to perpetuate their influence, power,I 3 « and ability to plan future aggrandizement and world domination, thus jeopardi zing the efforts of the United Nations to establish and permanently maintain peaceful international relations; Whereas, enemy countries and their nationals have taken the property of occupied countries and their nationals by open looting and plunder, by forcing transfers under duress, as well as by subtle and complex devices, often operated through the agency of their puppet governments, to give the cloak of legality to their roboery and to secure ownership and control of enter prises in the post-war period; Whereas, enemy countries and their nationals have also, through sales and other methods of transfer, run the chain of their ownership and control through occupied and neutral countries, thus making the problem of dis closure and disentanglement one of international character; Whereas, the United Nations have declared their intention to do their utmost to defeat the methods of dispossession practised by the enemy, have reserved their right to declare invalid any transfers of property belonging to persons within occupied territory, and have taken measures to protect and safeguard property, within their respective jurisdictions, owned by occupied countries and their nationals, as well as to prevent the disposal of looted pro perty in United Nations markets; therefore The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference i. Takes note of and fully supports steps taken by the United Nations for the purpose of: (a) uncovering, segregating, controlling, and making appropriate dis position of enemy assets; (b) preventing the liquidation of property looted by the enemy, locating and tracing ownership and control of such looted property, and taking appropriate measures with a view to restoration to its lawful owners; 2. Recommends: That all Governments of countries represented at this Conference take action consistent with their relations with the countries at war to call upon the Governments of neutral countries (а) to take immediate measures to prevent any disposition or transfer within territories subject to their jurisdiction of any (1) assets belonging to the Government or any individuals or institu tions within those United Nations occupied by the enemy; and (2) looted gold, currency, art objects, securities, other evidences of ownership in financial or business enterprises, and of other assets looted by the enemy; as well as to uncover, segregate and hold at the dis position of the post-liberation authorities in the appropriate country any such assets within territory subject to their jurisdiction; (б) to take immediate measures to prevent the concealment by fraudulent means or otherwise within countries subject to their jurisdiction of any (1) assets belonging to, or alleged to belong to, the Government of and individuals or institutions within enemy countries; (2) assets belonging to, or alleged to belong to, enemy leaders, their associates and collaborators; and to facilitate their ultimate delivery to the post-armistice authorities.I 4 VII INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS Whereas, in Article I of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary hand it is stated that one of the principal purposes of the Fund is to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy; Whereas, it is recognized that the complete attainment of this and other purposes and objectives stated in the Agreement cannot be achieved through the instrumentality of the Fund alone; therefore The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference Recommends : To the participating Governments that, in addition to implementing the specific monetary and financial measures which were the subject of this Con ference, they seek, with a view to creating in the field of international economic relations conditions necessary for the attainment of the purposes of the Fund and of the broader primary objectives of economic policy, to reach agreement as soon as possible on ways and means whereby they may best: (1) reduce obstacks to international trade and in other ways promote mutually advantageous international commercial relations; (2) bring about the orderly marketing of staple commodities at prices fair to the producer and consumer alike; (3) deal with the special problems of international concern which will arise from the cessation of production for war purposes; and (4) facilitate by co-operative effort the harmonization of national policies of Member States designed to promote and maintain high levels of employ ment and progressively rising standards of living.

If such date is later than that on which the country becomes eligible under Article XX, Section 4 (c) or (d), to buy currencies from the Fund, the Fund and the member shall agree on a provisional gold payment to be made under (b) above, and the balance of the member's subscription shall be paid in the member's currency, subject to appropriate adjustment between the member and the Fund when the net official holdings have been ascertained. Section 4. Payments when quotas are changed. (а) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota shall, within thirty days after the date of its consent, pay to the Fund twenty-five per cent, of the increase in gold and the balance in its own currency. If, how ever, on the date when the member consents to an increase, its monetary mserves are less than its new quota, the Fund may reduce the proportion of the increase to be paid in gold. (б) If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund shall, within thirty days after the date of the consent, pay to the member an amount equal to the reduction.

(b) A change in the par value of a member’s currency may be made only on the proposal of the member and only after consultation with the Fund. (c) When a change is proposed, the Fund shall first take into account the changes, if any, which have already taken place in the initial par value of the member’s currency as determined under Article XX, Section 4. If the proposed change, together with all previous changes, whether increases or decreases, (i) does not exceed ten per cent, of the initial par value, the Fund shall raise no objection, (ii) does not exceed a further ten per cent, of the initial par value, the Fund may either concur or object, but shall declare its attitude within seventy-two hours if the member so requests, (hi) is not within (i) or (ii) above, the Fund may either concur or object, but shall be entitled to a longer period in which to declare its attitude.

Effect of unauthorized changes. If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the objection of the Fund, in cases where the Fund is entitled to object, the member shall be ineligible to use the resources of the Fund unless the Fund otherwise deter mines; and if, after the expiration of a reasonable period, the difference between the member and the Fund continues, the matter shall be subject to the provisions of Article XV, Section 2 (b). Section 7. Uniform changes in par values.

Section 8. Maintenance of gold value of the Fund’s assets. (a) The gold value of the Fund’s assets shall be maintained notwithstanding changes in the par or foreign exchange value of the currency of any member.

' (c) Whenever the par value of a member’s currency is increased, the Fund shall return to such member within a reasonable time an amount in its currency equal to the increase in the gold value of its currency held by the Fund. (d) The provisions of this Section shall apply to a uniform proportionate change in the par values of the currencies of all members, unless at the time when such a change is proposed the Fund decides otherwise. Section 9. Separate currencies within a member’s territories.

This rule shall not apply when a member’s monetary reserves have decreased during the year by more than the Fund’s holdings of its currency have increased.I 22 (ii) If after the repurchase described in (i) above (if required) has been made, a member’s holdings of another member’s currency (or of gold acquired from that member) are found to have increased by reason of transactions in terms of that currency with other members or persons in their territories, the member whose holdings of such currency (or gold) have thus increased shall use the increase to repurchase its own currency from the Fund.

(ii) Require the member to sell its currency to the Fund for gold. Section 3. Scarcity of the Fund's holdings. (a) If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a member s currency seriously threatens the Fund’s ability to supply that currency, the Fund, whether or not it has issued a report under Section 1 of this Article, shall formally declare such currency scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its existing and accruing supply of the scarce currency with due regard to the relative needs of members, the general international economic situation and any other pertinent considerations. The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action. (b) A formal declaration under (a) above shall operate as an authorization to any member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, Sections 3 and 4, the member shall have complete jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations, but they shall be no more restrictive than is necessary to limit the demand for the scarce currency to the supply held by, or accruing to, the member in question, and they shall be relaxed and removed as rapidly as conditions permit. (c) The authorization under (6) above shall expire whenever the Fund formally declares the currency in question to be no longer scarce. Section 4. Administration of restrictions.

(c) The holdings of other official institutions or other banks within its territories may, in any particular case, be deemed by the Fund, after consulta tion with the member, to be official holdings to the extent that they are sub stantially in excess of working balances; provided that for the purpose of determining whether, in a particular case, holdings are in excess of working balances, there shall be deducted from such holdings amounts of currency due to official institutions and banks in the territories of members or non members specified under (d) below.

No member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the enemy shall be required, to make such a communication while that territory is a theatre of major hostilities or for such period thereafter as the Fund may determine. When such a member communicates the par value of its currency the provisions of (d) below shall apply.

When notification is given under (i) or (ii) above, the Fund and the member shall, within a period determined by the bund in the light of all relevant circumstances, agree upon a suitable par value for that currency. If the Fund and the member do not agree within the period so determined, the member shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Fund on the date when the period expires.

(ii) Within the extended period the. member may, if the Fund has begun exchange transactions, buy from the Fund with its currency the currencies of other members, but only under such conditions and in such amounts as may be prescribed by the Fund.

(e) If a member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the enemy adopts a new monetary unit before the date to be fixed under (d) (i) above, the par value fixed by that member for the new unit shall be com municated to the Fund and the provisions of (d) above shall apply. (/) Changes in par values agreed with the Fund under this Section shall not be taken into account in determining whether a proposed change falls within (i), (ii) or (iii) of Article IV, Section 5 (c).

On the oasis of the par value so communicated, the Fund -shall compute the par value of each separate currency. A communication or notification to the Fund under (a), (b) or. (d) above regarding the par value of a currency, shall also be deemed, unless the contrary is stated, to be a communication or notification regarding the par value of all the separate currencies referred to above. Any member may, however, make a communication or notification relating to the metro politan or any of the separate currencies alone. If the member does so, the provisions of the preceding paragraphs (including (d) above, if a territory where a separate currency exists has been occupied by the enemy) shall apply to each of these currencies separately. (h) The Fund shall begin exchange transactions at such date as it may determine after members having sixty-five per cent, of the total of the quotas set forth in Schedule A have become eligible, in accordance with the preceding paragraphs of this Section, to purchase the currencies of other members, but in no event until after major hostilities in Europe have ceased.40 (i) The Fund may postpone exchange transactions with any member if its circumstance are such that, in the opinion of the Fund, they would lead to use of the resources of the Fund in a manner contrary to the purposes of this Agreement or prejudicial to the Fund or the members.

(c) If after all the repurchases required under Article V, Section 7 (6), had been made, the result would exceed any of the limits specified in Article V, Section 7 (c), the Fund shall require such repurchases to be made by the members proportionately in such manner that the limits will not be exceeded. 2 - The Fund shall not acquire the currency of any non-member under Article *V Section 7 (i&gt;) and (c). 3- In calculating monetary reserves and the increase in monetary reserves during any year for the purpose of Article V, Section 7 (b) and (c), no account Shall be taken, unless deductions have otherwise been made by the member for such holdings, of a.ny increase in those monetary reserves which is due to currency previously inconver- tible having become convertible during the year; or to holdings which are the proceeds of a long-term or medium-term loan contracted during the year; or to holdings which have been transferred or set aside for repayment of a loan, during the subsequent year. 4.

The Conference has agreed on the problems needing attention, the measures which should be taken, and the forms of international co-operation or organization which are required. The agreement reached on these large and complex matters is without precedent in the history of international economic relations. I. The International Monetary Fund ' Since foreign trade affects the standard of life of every people, all countries have a vital interest in the system of exchange of national currencies and the regulations and conditions which govern its working. Because these monetary transactions are international exchanges, the nations must agree on the basic rules which govern the exchanges if the system is to work smoothly. When they do not agree, and when single nations and small groups of nations attempt by special and different regulations of the foreign exchanges to gain trade advantages, the result is instability, a reduced volume of foreign trade, and damage to national economies. This course of action is likely to lead to economic warfare and to endanger the world's peace. The Conference has therefore agreed that broad international action is necessary to maintain an international monetary system which will promote foreign trade. The nations should consult and agree on international mone tary changes which affect each other. They should outlaw practices which are agreed to be harmful to world prosperity, and they should assist each other to overcome short-term exchange difficulties. The Conference has agreed that the nations here represented should establish for these purposes a permanent international body, The International Mone tary Fund, with powers and resources adequate to perform the tasks assigned to it. Agreement has been reached concerning these powers and resources and the additional obligations which the member countries should undertake. Draft Articles of Agreement on these points have been prepared. II. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development r- It is in the interest of all nations that post-war reconstruction should be~ rapid. Likewise, the development of the resources of particular regions is in the general economic interest. Programmes of reconstruction and develop ment will speed economic progress everywhere, will aid political stability and foster peace. The Conference has agreed that expanded international investment is essential to provide a portion of the capital necessary for reconstruction and development. v The Conference has further agreed that the nations should co-operate to' increase the volume of foreign investment for these purposes, made through normal business channels. It is especially important that the nations should co-operate to share the risks of such foreign investment, since the benefits are general. The Conference has agreed that the nations should establish a permanent international body to perform these functions, to be called The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It has been agreed that the(46975) wt. 927—664 12/45 n.L. G. 390 (T.S. .‘0126) &lt; 70 Bank should assist in providing capital through normal channels at reason able rates of interest and for long periods for projects which will raise the productivity of the borrowing country. There is agreement that the Bank should guarantee loans made by others and that through their subscriptions of capital all countries should share with the borrowing country in guaranteeing such loans. Ihe Conference has agreed on the powers and resources which the Bank must have and on the obligations which the member countries must assume, and has prepared draft Articles of Agreement accordingly. The Conference has recommended that in carrying out the policies of the institutions here proposed special consideration should be given to the needs of countries which have suffered from enemy occupation and hostilities. The proposals formulated at the Conference for the establishment of the Fund and the Bank are now submitted, in accordance with the terms of the invitation, for consideration of the governments and people of the countries represented.1 g &amp; 10 Geo. 6 .

The programme you are to discuss constitutes, of course, only one phase of the arrangements which must he made between nations to insure an orderly, harmonious world. But it is a vital phase, affecting ordinary men and women everywhere. For it concerns the basis upon which they will be able to exchange with one another the natural riches of the earth and the products of their own industry and ingenuity. Commerce is the life blood of a free society. We must see to it that the arteries whicJj carry that blood stream are not clogged again, as they have been in the past, by artificial barriers created through senseless economic rivalries. Economic diseases are highly communicable. It follows, therefore, that the economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbours, near and distant. Only through a dynamic and a soundly expanding world economy can the living standards of individual nations be advanced to levels which will permit a full realisation of our hopes for the future ...” From president Roosevelt’s message to mem bers of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, June 29 , 1944 .MONEY AND THE POST-WAR WORLD The Story of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference Published for the UNITED NATIONS INFORMATION ORGANISATION 38 RUSSELL SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.l by HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE LONDON, 1945CONTENTS Chapter I The Problems of Bretton Woods : page 3 Chapter II How the Conference Worked : page 9 Chapter III How the Monetary Fund will Operate : page 12 Chapter IV How the Bank will Operate : page 23 Chapter V Conclusion : page 34 At the time of going to press the U.S.A. has ratified the Bretton Woods Agreement. In Great Britain the proposals have not yet been submitted to Parliament for approval and public opinion is not unanimous on the question of ratification.3 CHAPTER I THE PROBLEMS OF BRETTON WOODS oday, for the second time in one short generation, the human race has emerged from a mortal conflict for the survival of national and individual rights which ittook centuries to attain. For the second time, this conflict has been won, not by the mechanical, robot efficiency of those who believe in compulsion and conquest, but by the free and wholehearted co-operation of nations and men committed to the more generous concept of mutual aid for the common good. For the second time in a genera tion, historic events have affirmed the truth once suggested by Abraham Lincoln: that the human race cannot long exist half slave and half free, and that freedom must be achieved for all unless slavery is to envelop all. But behind these political facts, an even broader truth is emerging. For, as the experience of the past has shown, it is not only the political freedom of the world which is indivisible, but also its economic well-being. War may be waged in the economic field as well as on the battlefield, and as long as some nations, even peace-loving nations are prevented from attaining their legitimate aspirations for economic security, they will be a source of danger to the prosperity and well-being of other peace-loving nations. Thus Lincoln’s maxim may be extended still further; and we may say that a world half prosperous and half starving cannot long preserve peace, and that prosperity must be achieved for all unless insecurity is to spread to all. So, after victory on the battlefields, the United Nations still face a second obligation: to secure the economic, as well as military and political peace of the world. This can only be achieved by making sure that no peace-loving nation is ever so bereft of all legitimate means of earning a livelihood as to be forced to resort to un scrupulous economic methods, dangerous to the well-being of4 other nations. Coming after the most destructive war in all history, this task will be hardly less difficult than—and just as necessary as—victory on the battlefields. The Problem in General Terms Broadly speaking, the restoration and maintenance of economic peace in the post-war world involves the solution of two major problems: how to provide the initital machinery which many nations will need in order to achieve economic equilibrium, each in its own way, and secondly, how to create stable currency and exchange conditions so that each nation can freely and safely trade its products for other goods, which it cannot itself produce. The two are basically indivisible. It would serve little purpose to enable a country to develop its resources and to produce a surplus of goods if that surplus could then not be exchanged for other needed commodities. The Problem of International Trade The economy of modern nations—great powers and small powers alike—is highly interdependent. An industrial country may want to export and sell its surplus manufactured goods, but may have to import and buy raw materials and food. Or a nation may render financial aid to others which has to be repaid in some form of imports or services. Then again there is the agricultural nation which has to export and sell surplus food in order to import and buy manufactured goods. Yet another illustration of the economic interdependence of nations would be the case of a maritime country rendering services of transport in return for needed imports. The economic well-being of highly industrialised countries, such as the United States, Great Britain, and Belgium depends on the continued full employment of their manufacturing plants. On the one hand, the sales of the products of these plants provide the livelihood for vast numbers of the population. On the other hand, the plants, when working to capacity, are geared to produce not only enough goods to satisfy the home market, but, also, to provide a surplus for export to other countries. From export sales funds are obtained in those countries which enable the manufacturing5 nation to purchase their surplus raw materials which are needed to keep home industries working. To facilitate exchanges of surplus goods and services between the countries of the world intricate relations between the currencies had to be developed. For example, in a given year, Brazil might buy a greater value of goods and services from Great Britain than she sold to Great Britain. On the other hand, Brazil might have sold a greater value of goods and services to Norway than Norway sold to her, while simultaneously Norway might have sold a greater value of goods and services to Great Britain than she purchased from Great Britain. As a result of the transactions, Brazil is left with a surplus of ‘kroner’ (for surplus goods or services to Norway), Norway has a surplus of‘sterling’ (for surplus goods and services to the U.K.), and the U.K. has a surplus of ‘cruzeiros’ (for surplus goods and services to Brazil): hence, Brazil with her ‘kroner’ buvs U.K. sterling from Norway to buy back her ‘cruzeiros’ from the U.K., then Norway and Great Britain have to conduct similar transactions until the ledgers are balanced again. This is a relatively simple example, involving only three countries: actually, the mechanism of balancing trade and cur rency exchanges is nearly always multilateral, with a great many countries involved. To make this mechanism work, currencies, the media by which nations exchange their goods and services, and conduct business with each other, must be stable. If currencies are not “safe”, i.e., if their value is subject to considerable and unexpected variations, international trade becomes seriously impeded, if not impossible. An exporter of goods may incur a serious loss, because the cur rency in which he is to be paid has been suddenly depreciated. Likewise, an importer, of say, raw materials, may incur a similar loss, because of a sudden rise of the value of the currency in which he is to pay. Experience of the Inter-war Period Under certain circumstances, which are not always under the control of the country concerned, the value of a currency may vary considerably. But there are even more instances of deliberate currency variations by a great number of countries. Germany, in6 particular, developed a regular system of what has appropriately been called “currency warfare”. Among a series of currency tricks, perhaps the most unfair and successful was the device of multiple exchange rates. By various methods of exchange control Germany fixed a number of exchange rates for the mark (by 1938 there were more than 30 different kinds of mark!). Foreign importers who had to buy essential German goods were compelled to use high priced marks. But in the sale of German goods for which the demand was not very great, marks were offered at bargain prices. By such means Germany attempted to secure a larger share of a shrinking volume of world trade. But even peace- loving nations resorted to similar discriminatory currency devices in the period between the two World Wars. During this period, some nations experienced inflations of an extent and destructiveness which until then had not even been dreamed possible. Millions of family incomes were suddenly wiped out and billions in savings lost, while honest trade debts amounting to still more billions vanished suddenly into thin air. This period produced unemployment on a scale never before experienced, not only in underdeveloped countries, but in the richest and most productive nations on earth. Banks failed, fac tories closed, currencies dropped in value, and dozens of countries were gradually tempted—or forced—to surround themselves with trade and currency barriers which in the end threatened to turn the whole world into a chaos of warring economic cells, each surrounded by artificial walls. International action necessary Drawing the lessons from past experience the United Nations Monetary Conference at Bretton Woods proposed the Inter national Monetary Fund as the machinery for establishing stable relations between currencies and mutual confidence between countries in each other’s currencies in order that the conditions for world prosperity be re-created. The nations will consult and agree on international monetary changes which affect each other. They will outlaw practices which are agreed to be harmful to world prosperity, and they will assist each other to overcome short-term exchange difficulties.7 The Problem of Reconstruction The description of the problem in the foregoing paragraphs deals mainly with pre-war conditions. The problem today, however, has been made immeasurably more difficult by the ravages of war. In every country which has been overrun by the aggressors the means of production, distribution and sources of raw materials have been destroyed or disrupted. As a result, the people of those lands cannot, at present, re-start their farms, mines, factories, or means of distribution of products. Consequently they are unable to develop employment or build up supplies of surplus produce for export. And without selling exports, the people cannot obtain currency abroad with which to purchase not only the things they lack for home consumption, but even the raw materials on which their plants must work if the wheels are to run again. Thus, there is a special need to create some organisation by which those countries with capital assets may invest them, under conditions of reasonable security, in order to establish the machinery of production in the ravaged lands for the benefit of all. This is the task of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Development of New Resources Parallel to the need for development and reconstruction in war- stricken areas is the problem of developing the productive re sources of those many areas of the world which, for historical or other reasons, have not yet progressed as far as other areas. Large regions of this type still exist—for example, in Asia, or the Amazon basin—and many possess untapped resources, which could be developed for the benefit of their local populations, as well as of the rest of mankind. Many, too, are potential buyers who, if enabled to earn a sufficient income to pay for imports, could absorb large quantities of the products of others. Outside co operation in the form of capital investment or supply of machinery will be needed to tap these resources and to open these markets for the mutual benefit of all concerned. This again will be one of the principal responsibilities of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.8 Common Effort or Chaos The problem of development and reconstruction and the problem of currency stabilisation are as inseparable as the two sides of a coin. It is these twin problems which the Bretton Woods Con ference met to consider and solve. The world paid heavily for not solving them earlier. Because they were not solved after the last war, they brought unrest, inflation, then over-production and economic warfare, and finally a world-wide depression and un employment. This must not happen again. It is essential that concerted international effort shall be made to aid all peoples gradually to take their places in the community of nations as full-fledged partners in world trade, each producing and consuming a fair share of the earth’s goods in accordance with its ability and resources. In succeeding chapters of this pamphlet, the two proposals worked out by the conference to deal with the major phases of the general problem of economic peace are considered separately in considerable detail. This is done because the two issues, though so intimately interrelated, are still distinct, and because the solu tions proposed for them were developed by separate Commissions of the general Conference before being submitted to the Con ference as a whole for approval. Yet it is impostant to remember that, since the problems are interrelated, the proposed solutions,— the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development—are of necessity also intended to be complementary, each depending upon the other for full effectiveness. Without the Fund to oil the wheels of international trade, the Bank’s best efforts to revive production in certain regions would probably prove futile. Conversely, without the Bank to stimulate production, the resources of the Fund would certainly be inadequate to achieve the Fund’s purpose—the stabilisation of member currencies. Only if the Bank and the Fund operate together can the world hope to have that security in international commerce which is essential for permanent peace.9 CHAPTER II HOW THE CONFERENCE WORKED T wo years of study and of exploratory discussions between technical experts of the various United Nations preceded the formal meeting at Bretton Woods, and considerable agreement on many points had already been reached by the time the confer ence began. Thus when, on July 1 , 1944 , more than 400 delegates of the 44 United and Associated Nations forgathered at the invitation of President Roosevelt to consider concrete proposals arising from these studies, the majority of the delegates were already familiar with the issues at stake. All that remained was to iron out such differences of viewpoint as still existed, and to draw up final plans for the two institutions which the consensus of experts considered essential; an International Bank and an Inter national Monetary Fund. At the inaugural session of the full conference on July 1 , the chairman of the United States delegation, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., then Secretary of the Treasury, was unanimously elected perma nent President of the Conference. On the following day, to speed up the work of the Conference, it was decided that day by day consultation on the various pro posals before the Conference would be carried on by three Commissions. Commission I was to deal with plans for the Monetary Fund; Commission II with the Bank, and a third Com mission was to consider other methods of financial and economic co-operation between the attending nations. Dr. Harry D. White, prominent member of the United States delegation, was appointed chairman of Commission I; Lord Keynes, head of the British delegation, accepted the chairmanship of Commission II; and Eduardo Suarez, head of the Mexican delegation, assumed office as chairman of Commission III. The meetings of these Commis sions were to be staggered in such a way as to give the various10 national delegations an opportunity to be adequately represented at all meetings. Still further to expedite the work of the conference, Commissions I and II each set up four committees, while Commission III agreed to organise smaller committees to consider specific proposals whenever these were made. The four committees of Commission I were to deal with the following aspects of the proposed Monetary Fund : (a) the purposes, policies and obligations of the Fund; (b) the operations of the Fund; (c) the organisation and management of the Fund; (d) the form and status of the Fund. Commission II, assigned to study the plan for an International Bank, was divided into committees following a similar pattern. Committee chairmen were appointed for each of the committees, and in addition, each was provided with a Rapporteur, whose function it was to prepare reports on the conclusions reached by the various committees. These reports were periodically submitted for consideration by the three main Commissions, and were ulti mately consolidated into complete and unified plans. At the end of the Conference, on July 22 , each of the three main Commissions in turn reported on the results of its deliberations to a final plenary session of the Conference as a whole, and there the plans, de veloped during three weeks of almost continuous discussion and compromise, were put to a vote of the national delegations. The proposals of Commissions I and II for the International Monetary Fund and for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development were accepted unanimously, subject to certain modifications, described in the full report, to suit particular prob lems in special areas.* Three resolutions were introduced by Commission III. The first called for an early dissolution of the Bank of International Settle ments at Basle. The second asked that the neutral governments be requested to co-operate with the United Nations in recovering * For details of these reservations see H.M. Stationery Office publica tions of the Final Act and related Conference documents (Cmd. 6546 and Cmd. 6597 ).11 property looted from the occupied territories by the leaders and industries of the Axis, and the third appealed for close co-operation in the field of economic policies. A proposal to deal with the problems confronting certain nations due to the wide fluctuations in the world price of silver was put off by the Conference for further study at a later date. The schedule of the Conference, which made considerable de mands on the stamina and versatility of the individual delegates, was designed for maximum efficiency in developing, during one brief meeting, two complex institutions of a highly technical nature and of world-wide importance. The programme was followed with only one deviation: when on July 17 , after more than two weeks consultations, the Conference adjourned for one day to allow its members a much needed rest. Nonetheless, the fact that these 400 experts were actually able in three short weeks to achieve their goal and to produce specific proposals which could be accepted unanimously by the delegates of 44 nations bears witness not only to the excellent preparations made for the Conference, but also to the general spirit of co-operation and international good-will that prevailed throughout the meetings. Entirely aside from the importance of the plans formulated by the Conference as such, this success augurs well for the future of the United Nations. The former United States Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau, called it “One of the hearteningand hopeful portents of our time”, and summed up: “The representatives of the 44 nations faced difference of opinion frankly and reached an agreement which is rooted in genuine understanding. None of the nations represented here has had altogether its own way. We have had to yield to one another, not in respect to principles or essentials, but in respect to methods and procedural details. . . . We have done it in a spirit of good will and mutual trust. . . . Indeed, we have found that the only safeguard for our national interests lies in international co operation.” “If we can so continue,” said Lord Keynes, “the nightmare in which most of us here present have spent too much of our lives will be ended ”.12 CHAPTER III HOW THE MONETARY FUND WILL OPERATE lthough the subject of “money” has been called one of the most complex and least understood problems confronting the world, the proposal for an International Monetary Fund worked out at Bretton Woods is actually very simple. It is not intended to be a panacea for all the world’s monetary ills, but rather a shock-absorber. No nation whose economy is perman ently unbalanced will be able to rely on the Fund to make up its foreign trade deficits indefinitely, nor will the Fund alone be sufficient to assure a smooth flow of goods and money throughout the world. But what the Fund can do and is intended to do is to cushion members against temporary dislocations in the field of foreign trade, thereby making it unnecessary for them to resort to extreme and panicky measures to maintain their foreign trade balances. Divested of technical language and detail, the three main pro visions of the Fund proposal may be summed up as follows: 1 . The members of the Fund agree to abide by certain obliga tions with respect to their currency dealings which are deemed necessary to keep the world currency market stable and to promote the flow of foreign trade. Among the most important of these obligations are a pledge not to change the initially established par values of their currencies except after consultation with the Fund, and in accordance with the Agreement ; an obligation to make proceeds of international transactions freely convertible into other currencies as rapidly as possible; and an undertaking to refrain from discriminatory currency arrangements and multiple currency practice. 2 . In order to enable members to fulfil these obligations the member nations are to set up a permanent international pool, to be composed partly of gold, partly of the various national cur rencies of the participating nations.13 3 . Member nations will be permitted to buy from this pool limited amounts of such foreign currencies as they may need to pay off legitimate trade balances. They can do this by paying into the Fund an equivalent amount of their own currencies. National Quotas The core of the plan, of course, is the Fund itself. Its size has been initially set at $ 8 , 800 , 000,000 (£ 2 , 180 , 916 , 976 ),* to be subscribed by members in accordance with a fixed schedule of appropriate quotas. Each country must pay in gold as a minimum, 25 per cent, of its quota or 10 per cent, of its actual holdings of gold and U.S. dollars, whichever is the smaller; the balance of its quota is to be paid in the member country’s own currency. It is to be expected that several prospective members may find it difficult to ascertain their own true financial condition for some time after the end of the war. In the case of countries once occupied by the enemy, it may be necessary to adjust the par-values of their national currencies after the Agreement has gone into effect. The Agreement itself makes full allowance for this. It also takes into account the likelihood that the liberated countries may not be able immediately to determine their own gold reserves, and thus may not be able to furnish the required information to the Fund for some time after the end of the war. As to par-values, it may be said briefly that the initial par-values of all currencies are to be established on the basis of the exchange rates prevailing at the time the Agreement comes into force, or, if such a par-value is not satisfactory, by agreement with the Fund. These will be expressed in terms of gold, or of U.S. dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on July 1 , 1944 . A member can obtain the Fund’s concurrence in a change of its currency’s par-value, if such a change is necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium, provided that the change does not exceed ten per cent, of the initial par-value. On other changes the Fund may either concur or object within a certain period of time. * £ values on the basis of the dollar-sterling exchange rate at the time of Bretton Woods. (July 1, 1944.)14 It is also specifically stated that the Fund shall not object to a proposed change because of the domestic social or political policies of the member proposing the change. The Fund may also under certain conditions make uniform pro portionate changes in the par values of the currencies of all members; further, a member may make changes in the par value of its currency not affecting the international transactions of members without the concurrence of the fund. (This relates only to currencies of purely domestic circulation not entering into foreign trade). As to quotas, each member’s national subscription is to be paid in full to the Fund on or before the date when the member be comes eligible to buy currencies from the Fund. However, it is not contemplated that the full amount of the various quotas will be physically transferred to some central bank or depository. Initially 90 per cent, of the gold will be held in depositories within the borders of the five members having the largest quotas; the currency portion of all subscriptions need merely be deposited to the Fund’s credit at an acceptable central bank or other institution within the member’s own borders. Operations The size of the national quotas* allotted to the various prospective members of the Fund has a special importance, as it is used as the basis for determining three things: 1 . The amount of resources which each member is called upon to place at the disposal of the Fund. 2 . The amount of foreign exchange which each member will ordinarily be able to purchase from the Fund, and 3 . The voice which each member shall have in the administra tion of the Fund. A special provision of the Fund Agreement requires members wishing to buy foreign exchange for gold to make all their pur chases from the Fund, unless they can obtain better terms else where. This provision has been designed to replenish the gold supply. The Fund’s supply of member currencies has also been * Sec page 39.15 protected by the limitations imposed on the quantity of foreign currency which a member may purchase. To make the restrictions fair and equitable all round, it is proposed that the amount each member may buy from the Fund shall depend on the amount which that member originally paid into the Fund. In general, each member in good standing will be permitted during any 12 -months period to purchase from the Fund, in ex change for equivalent amounts of its own currency, foreign currencies of a total value not exceeding one-fourth of its original quota. Australia, for example, has a national quota of $ 200 , 000,000 (£ 49 , 566 , 295 ); she will therefore be allowed to put into the Fund, in exchange for foreign currencies, a total sum in Australian pounds not exceeding $ 50 , 000,000 (£ 12 , 391 , 573 ) annually. In addition, the Agreement imposes a further restriction of 200 per cent, of the quota on the total amount of any one member’s currency which the Fund may possess at one time. Thus, to return to the example, if Australia were to make use of her maximum purchasing rights for five years, she would then require special permission from the Fund for additional purchases in exchange for Australian pounds, for her five yearly purchases—each amount ing to 25 per cent, of her original quota—together with the 75 per cent of the quota which she originally paid in pounds would have increased the Fund’s holdings of Australian currency to the maximum of 200 per cent, of the quota. This provision, of course, is especially designed to keep any nation from relying on the facilities of the Fund to pay its deficits year after year, without making a determined effort to balance its foreign trade. Both limitations, like many others contained in the agreement, may be waived by the Fund under exceptional circumstances, especially in the case of members whose record indicates that they are not normally inclined to make excessive use of the Fund. The Fund, on the other hand, may demand special collateral or other security as a condition for waiving these limitations, even though that member has not yet made use of the Fund up to the full extent of the general restriction. Repurchase When a member has used the facilities of the Fund to the maxi mum extent permitted, it can make further purchases of foreign16 currencies from the Fund only for gold. Any member may at any time repurchase from the Fund excess amounts of its own currency. Furthermore, each member is required under the repurchase provisions to use its own reserves to the same extent that it uses the Fund’s resources to meet an adverse balance of payment so long as its national reserves of gold or convertible currencies are above its quota. When a country’s national reserves are above its quota and are increasing, it must also use one-half of the increase which has occurred during the year to repurchase its currency from the Fund. These provisions are designed to compel members to keep their accounts with the Fund in the best possible condition at all times, thus providing them with a maximum safety margin against future needs. Persistent drawing on the Fund by any one country to finance its imports would indicate that a country is importing too much relative to its exports. This would imply the existence of another country or group of countries importing too little relative to exports. Obviously, all countries must co-operate to correct the lack of balance. It was, of course, such a lack of balance which constituted one of the basic foreign trade problems of the inter war period. The Fund would have no authority to force creditor nations to accept goods in payment for their exports. If excess export con tinued, a scarcity would sooner or later develop in the Fund’s holdings of the exporting member-country’s currency. The Fund might then inform its members of the situation and could issue a report setting forth the causes of the scarcity. It could furthermore take steps to replenish its holdings of the scarce currency by pro posing that the member country lend its currency to the Fund. It could also buy the scarce currency from the country for gold. Should the Fund’s holdings of a scarce currency remain below 75 per cent, of the quota for a minimum of six months, the country in question could, if it so desired, use its own currency to buy the currency of another nation for the purpose of capital transfers, thereby strengthening the Fund’s holdings of the scarce currency. If the developing scarcity has not been corrected through these measures, the Fund shall declare the currency to be scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its supply of the scarce currency with17 due regard to the relative needs of members. The members them selves might, furthermore, after consultation with the Fund, in troduce control over the foreign exchange operations in scarce currencies. Charges Although the facilities of the Fund will be available to all members in good standing, the Fund will impose the following charges: 1 . Uniform “handling” or “service” charges, applying to all members equally, and intended solely to reimburse the Fund for its expenses and administrative costs in performing a certain trans action. This type of fee will apply to all sales of gold and currency and will vary, at the Fund’s discretion, between one-half and one per cent. The initial rate has been set at three-quarters per cent. 2 . An additional charge on the amount of any member’s cur rency which the Fund holds in excess of that member’s original national quota. These charges are graduated, both as to the amounts involved and the length of time for which they have been held. The scale of these interest charges—like many of the Fund’s other provisions—is deliberately designed to encourage members to keep their accounts with the Fund at a minimum, thus putting a premium on self-help. No charge at all will be made for the first three months, providing the excess currency held by the Fund does not exceed 25 per cent, of a member’s original quota. After the first three months, there will be a charge of one-half of one per cent, for the next nine months, and after that, the rate of interest will increase by another one-half of one per cent, for each additional year during which the Fund continues to hold the excess currency. Furthermore, the interest rate will be still higher if the excess held by the Fund exceeds 25 per cent, of the member’s quota, there being an additional charge of one-half per cent, for each additional 25 per cent, of the quota. Again using Australia as an example, this will mean that Australia may keep in the Fund free of charge for a three month period, an excess over her quota of up to 50 million dollars worth of Australian pounds; but that it would cost her up to three-and-one-half per cent.—were she to continue her borrowing until, during the fourth year, it had18 reached the maximum permitted under the agreement. As, gener ally speaking, all interest charges are payable in gold, this would soon make continued reliance upon the Fund discouragingly expensive. As a final check upon the excessive use of the Fund by members, the Agreement further stipulates that the Fund shall initiate con sultations with any member whose borrowings from the Fund have become so extensive as to drive the interest past four per cent, annually. If these consultations fail to produce mutually acceptable plans for reducing the member’s account, the Fund may impose any charges it “deems appropriate” as soon as the interest rate has further risen to five per cent, annually. Voting Procedure The voting strength of the member countries participating in the Fund is closely related to the size of their quotas. Each member will be entitled to one vote for every $ 100,000 (£ 24 , 783 ) of its quota, in addition to 250 initial votes, which all members receive regardless of the size of their national subscrip tions. Obviously, the initial votes are of little influence on the voting strength of the major and intermediate members. The United States, with its $ 2 , 750 , 000,000 quota, will yield 27,750 votes; Great Britain 13 , 250 ; China 5 , 750 ; Australia 2 , 250 . On the other hand, the 250 initial votes naturally are of much greater relative im portance to the countries with smaller quotas. As a general rule the voting strength of the members remains unaffected by the status of their accounts with the Fund. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule. When the Fund is to vote on ( 1 ) a request made by a member to purchase foreign exchange from the Fund against payment in its own currency beyond the limits provided in the agreement, or ( 2 ) a proposal to limit a member’s access to the Fund or to exclude it from all access to the Fund because of the member’s using the resources of the Fund in a manner contrary to the purposes of the Fund, the voting strength of the members is adjusted as follows:19 Each member will receive one additional vote for every $ 400,000 worth of net sales of its currency by the Fund. Conversely, how ever, each member will lose one vote for every $ 400,000 worth ol its net purchases of foreign exchange from the Fund against pay ment in its own currency. No country can, however, gain or lose more than one-quarter of its quota-votes. This adjustment tends to protect the interest ol creditor nations whenever votes must be taken on the two points mentioned above. For example, New Zealand and Norway each has a quota of $ 50 , 000 , 000 : each therefore has a basic voting strength of 750 votes (250 on the basis of membership plus 500 for their sub scriptions). Norway imports from New Zealand during the first year of the Fund’s operations $ 12 , 500,000 worth of dairy products, and uses the facilities of the Fund to obtain the required New Zealand currency. After having thus exhausted its right to draw on the Fund during the year, Norway applies to the Fund for a waiver of the annual limit in order to import from New Zealand an additional $ 5 , 000,000 worth of dairy products. In a vote on this request Norway will cast 750 — 12 , 500 , 000 : 400 , 000=719 votes and New Zealand will cast 750 + 12 , 500 , 000 : 400 , 000=781 votes. Administration Like the allotment of voting strength, the basis on which the Fund is to be governed against takes cognisance of the fact that a large share of the Fund’s total resources will be contributed by a few powerful members, and that these therefore should be given a proportionately heavier voice in administrative matters. The provisions regarding the selection, functions and compensation of the Fund’s various officials may be summed up as follows: 1 . All powers of the Fund shall be vested in a Board of Governors consisting of one governor and one alternate appointed by each member. Members may designate governors by any method they choose and may re-appoint or relieve them at will, but the basic term of appointment is five years. Governors and alternates are to serve without compensation from the Fund, but will receive reasonable travel expenses when required to attend meetings, which must be held at least annually. At such meetings, each20 governor—or, in his absence, his alternate—may cast all the votes to which his country is at that time entitled, and unless otherwise specified in the Agreement decisions of the Board of Governors shall be made by a simple majority vote. 2 . More immediate supervision of the general operations of the Fund is to be provided by a Board of Executive Directors, of whom there shall always be at least 12 . Five of this number are to be appointed by the five members having the largest national quotas (the United States, Great Britain, Russia, China and France). Of the remaining seven, two are to be elected by the Latin-American Republics, five by the other members jointly. The Board of Governors may vote to increase the total number of Directors whenever new members are admitted to the Fund, and there is a special provision by which two additional members may be given the right to appoint directors if, as a result of purchases by other members, the Fund’s holdings of their currencies have been reduced by a greater absolute amount than the Fund’s holdings of the currencies of the “Big Five’’. Like the Governors, Directors are to have alternates, whom they themselves may appoint. Unlike the Governors, however, the Executive Directors are to be in continuous session at the Head quarters of the Fund, and therefore are to be paid. Their decisions are to be made by a majority vote, with each director casting all the votes to which the members which appointed or elected him are entitled. Appointive Directors will serve at the discretion of the members appointing them; elective Directors are to serve two- year terms, re-election permitted. 3 . The actual, day-by-day management of the Fund will be placed in the hands of a qualified Managing Director, who will be selected by the Executive Directorate, but may not be a Governor or Director himself. The Managing Director will function as chairman of the Executive Directorate, but will not be entitled to cast a vote except in case of a tie. He will be assisted by a qualified staff, which is to be selected on the widest possible international basis consistent with operating efficiency. Official headquarters of the Fund is to be located in the country having the largest quota—the United States—with branch offices established in other countries as needed.21 Other Provisions A few of the more important points are dealt with briefly below: Profits : The agreement provides that the Board of Directors shall determine annually what part of the net income of the Fund is to be placed in reserve, and what part, if any, will be distributed to members. Entry into Force: The Fund agreement shall enter into force when it has been officially accepted by the governments of mem bers having not less than 65 per cent, of the total of all quotas set forth in the Agreement, and in no case before May 1 , 1945 . Mem ber countries may signify their formal acceptance by depositing with the United States documents stating that they accept the Agreement and have taken all the steps necessary to enable them to comply with its various provisions. These documents must be accompanied by a deposit in gold of one hundredth of one per cent, of the member’s total subscription. The Agreement will remain open for signature until December 31 , 1945 . If by that time the necessary minimum acceptance has not been reached, the United States is required to return any gold deposits made up until then, and the Fund will presumably be considered dead. Withdrawal from Membership: Any member may withdraw from the Fund without previous notice simply by notifying the Fund in writing. The Fund, on the other hand, may first suspend and Jater expel any member found unwilling to fulfil its obliga tions. In either case, the withdrawing member’s account with the Fund will be settled in full, and the Fund will return the member’s original quota plus any other amounts due to the member from the Fund, less any amount owing to the Fund from the member. The Fund’s payment to the member will be made in the member’s own currency or in gold, and the withdrawing member will be required to settle any balance due to the Fund in gold or “convertible” currencies. Liquidation: The Fund may be liquidated only by a decision of the Board of Governors. If liquidation is directed, the Fund shall first settle all current obligations, and then shall distribute the remainder of its assets in accordance with a fixed schedule. This schedule is designed to give each member a fair share of the Fund’s22 assets in a direct proportion to the member’s general contribution to the Fund. Limitation of Purposes A special section of the Agreement limits the use of the Fund’s resources to transactions on current account and capital transac tions of reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade, banking or other business. It specifically forbids use of its facilities for the purpose of making large or sustained transfers of capital from one country to another. The Agreement expressly provides that the Fund’s resources shall not be used for relief or rehabilitation nor for the settlement of abnormal indebtedness arising out of the war. The significance of these limitations is that it protects the Fund’s resources from excessive demands which might prevent the Fund from accomplishing the purposes for which it is intended.CHAPTER IV HOW THE BANK WILL OPERATE he function of the Bank is to aid and encourage international investment through the customary private channels. Its appro priate sphere of activity is to assist private investors in meeting the needs of an expanding world economy. In the immediate post-war years capital will be urgently required for reconversion to peace-time production, for the reconstruction of destroyed areas, and for the development of economically backward regions. The revival of international long-term lending on an adequate scale is essential to the attainment of a high level of world trade without which world prosperity is impossible. In view of the losses suffered by international investors in some countries in the pre-war years, aid and encouragement will undoubtedly be necess ary if adequate international long-term credits are to be provided by private investors. It is this specialised role which the Bank is to play. To the extent necessary, it will guarantee private invest ment abroad and thus encourage lending by private investors through the usual investment channels. In some instances, it will lend directly, out of its own resources or by participation with private investors. Procedures will be established to make certain that the Bank does not compete with private investment agencies and does not grant loans which can be placed in the private capital market on reasonable terms. The Bank’s operations as guarantor, participant, and lender will un doubtedly encourage private investments and its guarantee may well become the mark of a high grade security. The Bank, by reducing and sharing risks and by establishing standards for sound loans, will help to restore confidence in international investment. Although the major part of the Bank’s activities will be con cerned with loans, it will also provide assistance in the market for ordinary shares. The fact that foreign loan capital required for a24 project may be available through the Bank should considerably facilitate the acquisition of the ordinary shares which may be necessary. Structure Like the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is to be a voluntary, world-wide institution, with membership open initially to all the United and Associated Nations and to other nations under special arrange ments at a later time. Its function will be to encourage international trade and world prosperity by aiding members in the development of worthwhile, productive projects which they would not other wise be able to finance on reasonable terms. It will be the legal entity—and in the conduct of its business may sue or be sued except by the members and persons deriving their claims from members. The stockholders of this Bank will be the governments of mem ber nations, and no individuals will be permitted to own or acquire shares. There will be 100,000 shares altogether, each valued at $ 100 , 000 , thus giving the Bank a potential capital of $ 10 , 000 , 000,000 (£ 2 , 478 , 314 , 745 ). Of this total, 91 percent.—or 91,000 shares have been allocated to the 44 original members whose delegations helped frame the Agreement, the remainder is to be kept open for later purchase by Denmark, neutrals and other nations joining the Bank. This will give the Bank an initial capital of $ 9 , 100 , 000,000 (£ 2 , 255 , 266 , 418 ), providing all of the original members accept membership in the Bank. Allotment of individual subscriptions by members—that is, of the number of shares which each member will buy—is based on a quota system* which, with some modification, parallels that set up for the Fund. Thus the United States, China and Canada will each subscribe somewhat larger sums to the Bank than to the Fund, while other members, such as the Latin American republics, will pay somewhat less into the Bank. Only part of each member’s Bank subscription will have to be paid immediately and in gold. Only 20 per cent, of the price of each share may be called by the * See page 39 .25 Bank for direct loan operations, the remaining 80 per cent, may be retained by each member until such a time, if it ever comes, as some of it may be needed to make good on defaulted loans guaran teed by the Bank or to meet the other obligations of the Bank. These calls on the members are safeguarded by : 1 . The special reserve, provided in Art. IV, Section 6. 2 . The limitation on the total amount of loans and guaran ties (Art. Ill, Section 3 ). 3 . The provision enabling the Bank to redeem defaulting loans prior to maturity (Art. IV, Section 5 (c) and Section 7 (c)). Of the 20 per cent, of each member’s total subscription which may be called for direct loan operations, 18 per cent, is to be paid in the member’s own currency; the remaining two per cent, must be paid in gold or United States dollars. The gold portion of the various national subscriptions is to be paid within 60 days after the Bank begins operations, although this requirement may be slightly modified in the case of members whose territories were occupied by the enemy or whose gold reserves are immobilised as a result of the war; the remaining 18 per cent, is to be called by the Bank in instalments which may not exceed five per cent, of each member’s total subscription in any three months period and shall not be less than eight per cent, during the first year. It is convenient to visualise these detailed provisions for pay ment by means of two concrete examples: that of the United States, whose currency is dollars, and that of another subscriber, say Britain. The United States quota would be $ 3 , 175 , 000,000 (£ 786 , 864 , 932 ) —which means that it would purchase 31,750 shares of the Bank’s stock. If the United States joins the Bank, it will then have the option of paying the Bank, within 60 days, gold or United States dollars amounting to two percent. ($ 63 , 500 , 000 )-(£ 15 , 737 , 298 ) of its total subscription. Another 18 per cent. ($ 571 , 500 , 000 ) (£ 141 , 387 , 856 ) of the total price may be called by the Bank in dollars, over a period of time: at least eight per cent, within the first year, the remainder, at the Bank’s discretion, in instalments of not more than five per cent. ($ 158 , 750 , 000 ) (£ 39 , 343 , 246 ) of the total during any three months. The bulk of the total subscription26 —80 per cent, or $2,540,000,000 (£629,491,945)—need not be paid to the Bank at all until needed to meet guarantees of defaulted loans—that is, if all goes according to plan, most of it will never have to be paid at all. The case of Great Britain, with its $ 1,300,000,000 (£322,180,917) subscription will be somewhat different. If Britain ratifies, two per cent, of her quota—or $26,000,000 (£6,443,618)—will again be payable within two months in gold or United States dollars. However, all further instalments of Britain’s subscription, though due over the same period as the payments of the United States, will be payable in British pounds, not in dollars. Where it is necessary to make losses good, all members will have to meet the calls in gold or the currency which the Bank needs. It should also be noted that the rules of the Fund apply equally to all currencies of member governments. Administration A strong point of similarity between the Bank and Fund is to be found in the administrative structure of the two institutions. As in the case of the Fund, all the powers of the Bank will be vested in a Board of Governors, composed of one governor and one alternate appointed from each member. The Board of Gov ernors is to meet at least once a year, and its decisions except in special cases are to be made by a simple majority vote, with each governor—or in his absence, his alternate—casting all the votes to which the member he represents is entitled. Each member is to have 250 votes on the basis of membership, plus one additional vote for every share of the Bank’s stock which it holds. Initially this would give the United States 32,000 votes (250 plus 31,750); Great Britain 13,250; the U.S.S.R. 12,250; and so on down to 252 votes (250 plus 2) for the small republic of Panama. The Bank may, in due course, decide to increase the capital and determine the issue price of stock by the purchase of which members may increase their holdings proportionately. If it is decided at any time to increase the Bank’s total capital beyond the $ 10,000,000,000 (£2,478,314,745) maximum initially agreed upon, all members will be given an equal chance to purchase additional stock in propor-27 tion with their accepted quotas, but no member will be compelled to buy further shares. The immediate supervision of the Bank’s operations is again placed in the hands of a paid Executive Directorate of 12 members, five of whom will be appointed by the 5 members holding the largest number of shares (initially: The United States, Great Britain, the U.S.S.R., China and France). The remaining seven Executive Directors are to be elected on the basis of proportional representation by all the other members of the Bank. There is no provision allotting a fixed number of places on the Directorate to the Latin American republics, as is the case with the Fund. The term of office of all Directors, whether appointed or elected, is to be two years, with re-election or reappointment permitted in definitely. Each Executive Director will be entitled to cast all the votes to which the members appointing or electing him are entitled, and the decisions of the Directorate will be made on the basis of a majority vote. The Executive Directors shall select a President, who may not himself be a Governor or an Executive Director. The President will be the head of the Bank’s operating staff, which is to be recruited from qualified candidates representing the greatest pos sible number of member countries. He will also function as Chair man of the Executive Directorate, but will have no vote in its decisions except in the case of a tie. Headquarters of the Bank are to be located in the territory of the member holding the largest number of shares, which will be the United States. However, regional and branch offices are to be opened in all other areas where the Bank’s business warrants it, and these branch or regional offices are to be provided with regional advisers familiar with local problems. Advisory Council and Loan Committees Two features in the administrative structure of the proposed Bank have no parallel in the Fund. These are an Advisory Council, appointed by the Board of Governors, and Loan Committees which are to be appointed from time to time to consider projects for which loans are sought by the members.28 The Advisory Council is to be composed of seven or more repre sentatives of banking, commercial, industrial, labour and agricul tural interests of the members, and is to advise the Bank on matters of general policy. Its members are to be appointed for two-year terms, with reappointment permitted, and are to be selected on the widest possible international basis. They must meet at least annually, and will be paid reasonable expenses incurred in discharging their functions. Loan Committees will be appointed to investigate applications for specific loans from the Bank, and will be composed of one member appointed by the Governor representing the country in which the project for which the loan is sought is to be located, plus one or more experts from the technical staff of the Bank. Purposes and Limitations The making and guaranteeing of loans to members, their local governments and private enterprises for the development of sound and productive projects will be the main business of the pro posed Bank. It is important to realise that the Bank—like the Fund—is in no way intended to be either a charitable or relief institution, or on the other hand, to supplant private banking. It is to be sound and self-supporting, designed to encourage and supplement—rather than replace—private business in the encour agement and financing of post-war production, and the day-by day conduct of its transactions will be subject to definite rules and restrictions. Article I of the Articles of Agreement concerning the Bank defines its main functions as follows: (I) To assist in the reconstruction and development of territories of members by facilitating the investment of capital for productive purposes, including the economies destroyed or disrupted by war, the reconversion of product ive facilities to peacetime needs, and the encouragement of the development of productive facilities and resources in less developed countries. (II) To promote private foreign investment by means of guarantees or participations in loans and other investments made by private investors; and when private capital is not29 available on reasonable terms, to supplement private in vestment by providing, on suitable conditions, finance for productive purposes out of its own capital, funds raised by it and other resources. (HI) To promote the long-range balanced growth of international trade and the maintenance of equilibrium of balances of payments by encouraging international invest ment for the development of the productive resources of members, thereby assisting in raising productivity, the standard of living and conditions of labour in their territories. (IV) To arrange the loans made or guaranteed by it in relation to international loans through other channels so that the more useful and urgent projects, large and small alike, will be dealt with first. (V) To conduct its operations with due regard to the effect of international investment on business conditions in the territories of members and, in the immediate post-war years, to assist in bringing about a smooth transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy. It will be noted that these provisions automatically eliminate non-productive or speculative loans from consideration by the Bank, and that they lay maximum stress on the encouragement of private loans whenever these are available to members. They furthermore emphasise the paramount role in the reconstruction of the postwar world which private business everywhere is expected to play. Article III of the Agreement further limits the conditions under which the Bank may make or guarantee loans in the following important respects: 1. Loans may be made or guaranteed only for specific projects examined and approved by responsible committees, and then only if the borrower appears likely to be able to meet his obligations. 2. In the case of private loans which the Bank is asked to guarantee, the Bank must satisfy itself not only that all the terms of the proposed loan are reasonable and appropriate, but also that the borrower would not be able to obtain the desired loan on reasonable terms without a guarantee from the Bank. If these30 conditions are met, the Bank must still charge a reasonable fee to ( compensate it for the risk of assuming a guarantee. I 3. Where loans or guarantees are sought by local governments v or private enterprises in a member country, the national govern- f ments of the member must also guarantee the loan. Operations c It will be seen from the foregoing that, while all the Bank’s trans actions are to be conducted in accordance with accepted “sound” business principles, the Bank is not committeed to any one hard- and-fast method of dealing with members in need of assistance. While direct loans to member governments or other member interests out of the Bank’s capital may be necessary activities, I these loans are limited by the agreement to less than $2,000,000,000 ( (£495,662,949), even if all of the original members represented at I Bretton Woods participate in the Bank. The difference between this sum and the total resources available to the Bank—possibly close to $10,000,000,000 (£2,478,314,745)—can be put to work &lt; either in the form of backing for guarantees or in the form of direct &lt; loans out of funds borrowed by the Bank in the private capital f market. 1 Furthermore, the Agreement does not limit the Bank to making or guaranteeing loans only for the member governments. The administrative areas of members—such as cities and counties— &lt; and all responsible business, industrial and agricultural enterprises &lt; are eligible to obtain loans, providing all other conditions are met &lt; and the government involved in the proposed transaction guaran- I tees the loan. As to amounts, it is not necessary that the Bank &lt; should assume the responsibility for the full amount of any given i loan; it may either make or guarantee any portion of larger loans which it chooses. In this and all other questions of detail, the Bank is given the widest possible latitude to encourage co-operation, i not only between public and private interests, but various private interests themselves in developing and rebuilding the world’s 1 productive machinery everywhere. ] Let it be assumed, for example, that a new power plant is badly i needed to furnish electricity for a new textile plant in some Chinese city, and that the necessary machinery is not available in31 China, but must be purchased from the United States or Great Britain. Assuming the project to be sound and to have the appro val of the Chinese Government, the following different methods of financing are possible: 1. The Chinese Government itself might decide to build the plant for government operation. Being unable to pay for the re quired machinery outright, it would try to raise part or all of the money from private sources. If it was unable to do so, it would then go to the Bank for a guarantee. If the funds could not be obtained from the private capital market, even with the Bank’s guarantee, China would go to the Bank for a direct loan. 2. The city in which the plant is to be located might build the plant as a municipal enterprise. It would then have open to it all of the same possibilities available to the national government, providing only that the government is willing to guarantee whatever agreements it makes. 3. The whole project might be placed into the hands of a Chinese private firm, which could in turn finance it either wholly or in part with a private loan guaranteed by the Bank, or, if financing could not otherwise be obtained, with a direct loan from the Bank. Here again a guarantee from the Chinese government would be needed before the Bank could act. Generally speaking, direct loans will be made in the currency of the country in which the money is to be spent. Except in very exceptional cases, the Bank will not make or guarantee loans for expenditures in the borrowing countries. Loans will be granted to cover the goods and services which the borrower must import and for which he must pay currencies other than his own. It will not be possible, therefore, for any member to finance his national work or relief programmes with money obtained from the Bank. Such projects will continue to depend on national and domestic resources for financing. If the Bank should find itself short of certain currencies needed for loans, it may borrow them or convert some of its other cur rencies, providing all the members concerned agree. Each member assumes the responsibility for reimbursing the Bank for any losses which the Bank may sustain due to the member’s devaluation of its currency.32 Charges a The services of the Bank will be subject to reasonable charges. u On direct loans interest will be charged at a rate to be determined C by the Bank. On loans provided out of funds raised by the Bank n (e.g. by the issuance of its bonds) the Bank will in addition charge d a commission, which during the first ten years of the Bank’s c operations, will vary between one and one and a half per cent, of tl the amount outstanding. After ten years the Bank may either ii lower or—for new loans—raise the rate in accordance with lessons n learned from experience. tl If the Bank guarantees a loan obtained from private sources— a and this is to be the most important activity of the Bank—it will p charge a commission the amount of which will, during the first tl ten years of the Bank’s operations, vary between one and one-and- t&lt; a-half per cent, on the amount of the loan outstanding. These rates may also be revised after ten years. tl Except in special cases, all charges will be payable to the Bank n in the currency in which the basic loan was made, or—at the o borrower’s option—in gold. d The Bank will assist borrowers to obtain foreign loans on o reasonable terms. The reason for this is that the Bank’s guarantee o of any given loan is likely to reduce the lender’s risk to such an extent that he will be able to lend profitably at lower interest rates. E Furthermore, the Bank will itself exercise a favourable influence on ^ the private investment market by stressing the importance of t ] reasonable rates and terms appropriate to loan projects. 0 The amount of commissions received by the Bank on guarantees n and direct loans will be set aside as a special reserve and will be a held in liquid form. This special reserve will be kept available for g meeting liabilities of the Bank. Other income may be distributed n among members if the Board of Directors so determines. The ^ Bank’s interest and services charges will help to cover any defaults ^ which may occur. 0 1 Other Provisions / The Articles of Agreement provide that the Bank will observe strict political neutrality, basing all its decisions on a sound and business-like interpretation of the purposes for which it was createdand taking no action, direct or indirect, which would tend to exert undue influence on the internal political affairs of its members. Conversely, it is provided that the President and staff of the Bank must be free of political influences and obligations, owing their duty solely to the Bank and its interests. The Bank’s communi cations are to enjoy the same status as official communications of the various members, and the Bank’s archives are granted specific immunity from all form of seizure or interference. Certain im munities are also extended to the Bank’s staff, when engaged in the performance of its duty, and the Bank’s assets and earnings are to be free from all sorts of local taxation. Taxes may be im posed on the securities and obligations issued or guaranteed by the Bank, but only on a non-discriminatory basis, applying equally to all similar forms of securities. Other miscellaneous details of the Bank Agreement—such as the right of members to withdraw, the terms under which the Bank may dissolve, etc.,—are closely patterned after similar articles con cerned with the Fund. The settlement of the accounts of a with drawing member or of all members upon liquidation is more complicated in the case of the Bank, for no member can be relieved of the obligations incurred by the Bank while it was a member. Entry Into Force As with the Fund, all provisions of the Agreement dealing with the Bank will enter into force—and the Bank itself will begin operations—when the Agreement has been ratified by govern ments whose combined subscriptions total at least 65 per cent, of the allotted quotas, but in no case before May 1, 1945. The United States Government is again designated to receive the official notices of acceptance from members, as well as the small gold or dollar payments (one hundredth per cent, of the total subscription) which must accompany these notifications. If a sufficient number of governments have not ratified the Agreement by December 31, 1945, all deposits will be returned to their senders unless the Agreement has been previously amended by international action.34 CHAPTER V CONCLUSION S ince the Bretton Woods Conference ended, events in Europe and in the Pacific have advanced so swiftly that many of the circumstances which the Conference foresaw have already come to pass. With the defeat of Germany and Japan accom plished, the free nations of the world have entered the new, hard struggle of re-building their national life and of re-establishing world economic relations. The great conflict has left its scars; not only ruins and physical desolation but even more serious economic chaos, hunger, poverty, unemployment and disease. In many countries thousands of factories stand idle—though they could furnish jobs for the hungry and produce badly needed essential goods—because their equipment has been damaged, destroyed or looted during the war. Some of the most important harbours have been made useless for years to come. And all these factors, besides many others, are intensified by inflation. These events underline the outstanding need for far-sighted and comprehensive international planning to combat continued economic insecurity. Is Plan Big Enough? One question that is being asked is: can it really be hoped that the two proposed institutions, with their combined capital of a little less than $18,000,000,000 (£4,460,966,542) will be able to cope with problems left in the wake of a war which has cost Great Britain and the United States alone more than twenty times that sum? Or is it not likely that the Bank and the Fund will be com pletely overwhelmed and will be destined to failure within a few years simply because they are not big enough? In this connection, it is worth pointing out that the average of gross international investment between 1923 and 1937 was lessthan $3,000,000,000 (£743,494,423) per year. While it is true that the demands made upon capital for international investment after the war will be much greater, it is necessary to repeat that the International Bank is not intended to furnish all, or even the major portion of that capital, but is to act merely as a “support” for pri vate investment, with direct loans limited to cases where private capital is not available. Thus the $9,100,000,000 (£2,255,266,418) capital available to the Bank will act as a primer rather than as the full charge, and its effect will be multiplied many times over. Similarly, during the three year period of 1936-38, the total international debit balances—money paid out to cover an excess of imports over exports by the various countries—was something like $2,500,000,000 (£619,578,686). Thus the Monetary Fund, with its $8,800,000,000 (£2,180,916,976) of assets is several times as much as the usual pre-war average of international debit balances. As it is by its nature a short-term revolving Fund, it should replenish itself continually. It should also be noted that a great part of the prob lems after the war will require domestic effort for their solution and that it is only the residual problems that require international effort. Bretton Woods and the Gold Standard There has been considerable discussion on the relationship of the proposals to the gold standard. A Report submitted by the Com mittee on Banking and Currency to the U.S. House of Represen tatives of May 30, 1945,—and it should be remembered that the United States is one of the few major powers prepared to maintain the traditional gold standard—puts the question as follows :— “. . . A policy based on imposing the gold standard on other countries is doomed to failure. If we should insist on such a programme, an international agreement on monetary policy of any kind would be extremely difficult and would probably be impossible of attainment at this time. “The Fund Agreement embodies the fundamental advantages of stability and order that can be secured from the gold standard without forcing its rigidities on countries which are unwilling and unable to accept them. All currencies are defined in terms of gold, and with gold it will be possible to buy the currency of36 any member country at a nearly fixed price for the purpose of settling international payments. Also in connection with current transactions, the currency of every member would be freely convertible by exporters and foreign investors into their own currencies. “The committee is impressed by the fact that entirely too much emphasis is put on the name to be given to the exchange provisions of the Fund Agreement. Because some people in this country have called these arrangements a form of the gold standard and others in England have called them the opposite of a gold standard, there is said to be a misunderstanding on the meaning of these exchange provisions. In fact, the provisions are clear enough. They provide for defining currencies in terms of gold, for maintaining exchanges stable within one per cent, of parity, and for making changes in parity only after consulta tion with the Fund. It is not of great consequence what name is given to these arrangements. It is significant that they provide for stability and order in exchange rates”. Under the Bretton Woods plan, gold would be reinstated in its useful role as a “standard” or measure of international trade values. Yet at the same time, the plan would still make it possible for gold-poor nations to trade, thus reinstating gold as a stable yard-stick without condemning to economic strangulation those nations which do not have any. Information Pool An important incidental benefit of the Bretton Woods plan would arise from those of its provisions which require members to furnish the Fund and Bank with accurate information on such matters as their monetary reserves, gold production, balance of payments and international investments. These provisions are hedged with clauses protecting the interests of the nations furnishing the information and are not intended to make private business secrets generally available to the unauthor ised. They would, how'ever, provide something the world has never had before; a complete pool of information relating to the world economic system which would be available to all member countries and provide them with very helpful information.37 Ratification The fate of the Bretton Woods Agreement now lies with the legis lative bodies of the 44 nations whose experts gave the best of their experience and knowledge to its development. By December 31, 1945, enough of these legislatures must have decided to ratify the Agreement to enable the Bank and the Fund to begin operations, or the Agreement, by its own terms will lapse. The governments ratifying must control at least 65 per cent, of the allotted quotas. This means that a number of smaller countries could neglect to ratify the Agreement without ill effect—but any two or three of the major powers could doom the Agreement to failure. In the case of the Bank, for example, the United States alone is to control nearly 32 per cent, of the quotas and votes. Thus the United States alone could practically block the Agreement from coming into effect, even though a numerical majority of other countries were strongly in favour of ratification. In point of fact the United States was the first major country to ratify the Bretton Woods proposals on July 19, 1945. What would happen if the Agreement were to be rejected is difficult to foresee in its entirety. Perhaps another agreement could be drawn up which would prove more acceptable to the governments in question and still achieve broadly the same essen tial objectives. At best, this would require another conference and might well take years, as Bretton Woods itself was two years in the making, and in the meantime, those very disasters which the Agreement was designed to forestall might already have taken place. The stakes are high, and the issues at stake are urgent. As Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the permanent President of the Confer ence, said in his closing address: “The results (of the Agreement’s consideration by the legisla tures of member nations) will be of vital importance to everyone in every country. In the last analysis, it will help determine whether or not people will have jobs and the amount of money they are to find in their weekly pay envelope. More important still, it concerns the world in which our children are to grow to maturity. It concerns the opportunities which will await millions of younger38 men when at last they can take off their uniforms and come home to civilian jobs. . . . “We are at a crossroad, and we must go one way or the other. The Conference at Bretton Woods has erected a signpost—a sign post pointing down a highway broad enough for all men to walk in step and side by side. If they will set out together, there is nothing on earth that need stop them.”In the same series HELPING THE PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES. U.N.R.R.

The question therefore now arises of 0 etting 'local legislation ” passed in the Sheikhdoms. The provisions of the Agreements which are to have the force of law are set out in the Schedule to the iiretton hoods Agreement Order, 1946. So f s r as concerns non-self-governing territories of the Empire, these obligations are limited to the enactment that certain exchange malpractices are not enforceable in the courts, and tothe grant of judicial status to the Fund and Bank and appropriate immunities to their property and officials if they happen to be in the territory conceimed. Xn the case of Tonga the High Commissioner, Yves tern Pacific, was, before .H.M. G actually signed the Bretton V»oods Agreements, instructed to approach the Government of Tonga with the request that legislation might be enacted-on the dfaft of which a copy is enclosed. This is a bit elaborate, but it may be useful as a guide to what is reouired. 4. I should be glad if you would consider the best way of going about this business in respect of the Sheikhdoms.
