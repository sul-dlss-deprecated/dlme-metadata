It says something for the courage of this Government that they nave prooosed to grant sucn wide powers to Mr. Millspaugh. Without wide powers the dangers of the economic situation cannot be controlled and no Persian could use such pov/ers effectively. 2.

Of February and March allocations, however, only some 5,000 tons nave so far reached Tehran. Allowing another 1,000 tons or so already on the railway, this leaves some 16,000 tons to be moved up the railway in the remaining seventy days till the end of May. Although special arrangements have been made to move 300^(repeat 300) tons of wheat a day by rail during part of Marcn in order to establish a small reserve here, normally agreed rate is 160 (repeat 160) tons a day and the present intention is to revert to this rate as from April x S X • 5. As supply position given in paragraph 1 above would permit daily movement of 228 tons I would strong^ urge, if we wish to improve the situation here, that the normal' daily lift be increased from 160 to 200 (repeat 200) tons until further notice. Deliveries at the rate of 160 tons are eaten as fast as they arrive and provide no margin for building up reserve in Tehran itself, without which we can never be at ease here however excellent our planning. Until now we have acnieved no more than staving off starvation and it is impera tive that we should improve on this. Speedy provision of' reserve in Tehran will also have most important result of freeing Sher..... from the almost daily distraction of looking for tomorrow s bread and giving him the time which he now lacks to plan for the next harvest. 4. Supplies to Russia might suffer, but Russians have been repeatedly warned of this possibility if they refuse to south. Rate could be reduced again as soon as say 1,000 tons had been accumulated in silo here.

Arrangements are proceedin hi Tehran' to form a central pool of the agricultural machinery and tract»rs belonging to thr Government and at pr-~eut in the 1 *nnds of different Ministries. It is doubtful whetner there exisus in Iran any organisation other than the Khuzistan Agricult ral Society (under British management) capable of exploiting properly the use of agricul tural machinery on a large scale; and the Committee will probably concentrate on procuring for that scheme as much as possible of the machinery and tractors now lying idle throughovt the country. It would be greatly appreciated if Consular Officers would report the existence in their districts of machinery of this kind which could be taken over for the Khuzir - tan Agricultural Society, whose needs must be supplied as much as possible from the resources of the country. 7. The Agricultural Committee has also discussed methods o' increasing the production of sugar beet (the concern of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and so not a question that c a be taken up effectively by the Committee), soya bean cultivati w and other topics of current interest; and Consular Officers will be kept informed of any interesting developments in these or other questions affecting .griculture. 8 . I much appreciate th . trouble that has been taken to pm vide the information on agriculture so far received. It has unfortunately not been possible to follow up every suggestion put forward concerning particular problems encountered in certain districts, but 1 would not like it to be thought that these have been ignored. The chief value of such reports, however, has been to provide a store of reliable information c . current conditions, without which the ^ork of the Agricultural Committee would have been mainly guess work. I hone, therefo'. that it will be possible 'or all Consular Officers to continue to furnish reports cm agricultural conditions, with particular reference to the points referred to in this despatch, and to establish and continue cooperation with the Iranian Authority r - and Spring Sowing Commissions working in their district.

Y/e have seen Amast 4727, in which there is no mention of any proposed loadings of wheat for Persia on Russian aid ships. If the necessary quantities can he loaded in other tonnage, so much the better, hut if this cannot he done and most serious consequences are to he avoided, wheat must he loaded on at Russian expense. Matter is urgent, since the latest information 11 from Middle East Supply Centre is that Persian G-ulf wheat stocks 11 will he entirely exhausted hy the end of May and if any v/heat is to reach Persian Government in June it must he loaded at once. Owing to failure to ship quantities expected in February it is most desirable that 17,000 tons should he loaded this month. I 3. My teleg ram No- 1208 [of 22nd February] ^paragraph 2. Y/e cannot guars.ptee that wheat delivered to Persian Government will he identicai*y/heat shipped at Russian expense, since some of the latter may have to he used for repayment of stocks advanced to Persian Government from Middle East Supply Centre pool. But total wheat delivered to Persia under Anglo-American undertaking will certainly exceed the amount shipped at Russian expense and any diversion of the latter will thus he apparent only.

These are dding their best to bring about starvation conditions in their areas so as to compel the Grovernment to relax control and to allow the bakers to buy their require ments in the open market. Landlords and bakers will then be able to com bine to keep the price of wheat and bread as high as possible so as to earn the maximum profits regardless of the suffering caused thereby. Sfde wins, one of the main objects of the J.L.Os schmme, life., to ensure the feeding of their districts without recourse to imports from abroad, will have been achieved. 3. The results as far as can be foreseen at present are as follows: Lermanshah. The landlords, aided by the Governor-General ..nd atrocious weather conditions, are putting up a stem fight, and latest reports show that they have almost succeeded in reducing the town to starvation. Bourne is however still endeavouring to bring in supplies by camel, donkey and motor transport when he con get it, bat the scales are heavily weighted against him. If, however, he can weather the next two weeks xs hir chances will be greatiy improved. Ham^d^n. It looks as if in the absence of the Governor in Tehran, and eom&lt; what to his annoyance, the landlords have been routed by a bold stroke on the part of .shtiani, a forciful but unsc rafale us agKids agent of the LLnictr; of apply, with the support of the G.L.C. A siidolew, Sca&gt;&lt;jp f landlords who were only released on paying a cash deposit of three times the v^lue of the grain they owed, so frightened their fellow-defaulters that deliveries are being greatly accelerated and the area should be able, not only to feed itself, but also to supply farther considerable quantities to the capital, bultonabad. Major Hancock and a surprisingly active Gommissicn' have launched a spirited attack on vested interests, but landdenere have masteret M.a'S, the press and all the political influence they con command in the capital, and are trying to restore their position by bombarding the Prime Minister and the Minister of Supplies. In Isfahan iolonel Hebert, after a gallant single-handed struggle, has been defeated, and the bakers h-ve undertaken to feed the town till the next harvest. The price of bre^d h s already been raised to about 6 riails a kilo and the black market price of v/heat to 10,000 fcials a ton. It will be for Golonel Sohomberg to see if he can continue to supply a sufficient quantity of grain at the Government price to prevent the price of bread from rising still further* The situation in Shiraz will probJly be very similar to that in Isfahan, but the arrival of imported b rley at Bus hire should enable a check to be maintained on any excessive rise in the price of bread as well as supplying the oomparitively modest needs of Buehire itself. In Merman the 3.L.O. is likely to secure a handsome victory. ddid by the efforts of our Consular officers in oast Iran he has prospects of getting in sufficient grain f^om Bis tan to carry hi:;i through to the next harvest. 4 4, In Tehran the position is still critical, but improvement has only been prevented by the phenomenal cold on the railway and an unpreftfcdanted fall of snow v/hioh have interfered with the arrival of tu*e supplies by rail and road. The situation w^s only saved by accstBntdto the sudden and anesqpected/arrival of many wagons of wheat from Grurgan. The most plausible explanation of this windfall appears to be x last minute intervention on the part of the itassians to try and save the $awam Government, which tmfor^^ately fell the day before thes-e supplies began to arrive. 5* Uo wheat has yet began to come in from .zerbaljan, bat the latest information is that owing to the energy displayed by Mr. Vivian some &amp; t QCC tons of wheat and 6 t OuO tons of barley have already been delivered to the aassians against their demands, and that their attitude, at least in Tehran* is at the moment less -g&amp;ressive./- f A&lt;UL. t yff ^Br^ti^h Ta gcv tl cm &lt;-C ~' , bsaav• 10th February 194^.

ViviatA. • The aituatiOAi, to ^uote hr. Its main features are; Vivian, is a grim one a) Azerbaijan cannot send Aore wheat to Tehran at present. b) Tabriz it sell has no more than 800 tons of wheat and flour in hcthd. e) Deliveries to tae Muaaiaas are far behind soheduie. d) There are large reserves ox grain in Azerbaijan, but the quantities in uhe depots on motarable roads are relatively email; there are considerable quantities in other govern ment depots but tiiese are off the main roads, and slow animal transport will have to be used for the first stage; tiiere are still larger, although indefinite, quantities which are surplus to the needs of the local population, but which have been withheld by hoarders vdth 'the connivance of corrupt officials, and, In order to secure this grain, obgtractiveneos as well as the difficulties of transport will have to be overcome.

How much grain is thus hoarded is still an open question, iou are award that my Soviet colleague and I made determined faint elf rts to obtain inf am at ion in July and August, but that we were defeated by obstruction and ineffic iency. fhe Ausai&amp;a Oonsulatu-Oeneral, after enquiry, computed the wheat turplus at 55,000 tans; a prominent local expert gave me tui figure of 50,000 toils, wheat and oarley. Trie figures in the two enclosures tend to confirm these estimates. In the districts of karagha and Ardeuil, which are the only two yet visited by Mr. Vivian, the government holds at the moment 10,870 tons of grain, from Ardebil tna the district to the westward several thousand tens have already cmae forward, making say, 14,000 tons in all. It seems certain, from the facts coming to light, that this is not more than one-third of the amount which officialdom ought to have secured, and indeed Mr. Vivian has dciiiandad that these two districts produce a further 25,000 tons, hut Mr. Vivian has not yet had time to survey the possibilities of Hashtarud, of Soldusi or the Kurdish districts further west, of the Bokhan and other Kurdish dis tricts south of the lake, of the Kara dag n whence letters come complaining that nobody has been round to buy grain this year and wiser# there are willing sellers at Ale. 1500 a ton. Xhal- khal 1 omit, because the harvest th^re was small owing to reauced sowings* I must, however, add a further cusideratlon: the allied occupation prevented tne collection of much of the 1941 wneat, ahi without doubt there are respectable quantities of wheat from that harvest st HI in t be hand a of peasants and landlorue* In your despatch ao. 345 of the 17th October last to the Foreign Office it ie stated that tae maximum surplus 'available** is 20,000 tons and possibly 10,000 more from the Kurds. Ao such amount, as Mr. Vivian hue shown, i^Actually available for immediate use, but I am sure that a very much greater uurplus would uwcome available ix only boibc ms ans could be devised of making the landlords and peasants part with it. A-,• Viviau has ass^uDl^a iaiiUloras aad appaaied ior thuir daly. dattlug no rtispouw, n&amp; has thraataaod tiiaifi %ith oour^iiiartial, but the doyeraor-Oeiiurol and the Kusaia&amp;s have ti’owaed oa this aethod ol approach to the s jx .ibieiii and lie has abaudDixed it* He has aXso c csisidered a special iora of coapulaioxi for Tabriz in order to secure ol the ^raia hoarded in the city itself, but he has been persuaded that panic and still higher prices would probably ensue* Today he decided that he isaust laake the aest or existing regulation's and penalties; therefore, uxaess iie nas to change hie mind again he will declare the Anti-Hoarding new applicable, will Make an exaaiole of a” lew pi*eminent hoarders, and offa r payment of the reward to iufora«r8 la t to tom or aoaopoly gooae - su^ar, pleoa-gooda, 1 . 0 a. cut tala will taka time, aad lr.

Qnc of them has told me that tin grain is hidden in wells am secret stores where it will be left to rot unless wnat he glibly called !, the world price rt is paid for* it. He aoes not Know what the world price is, but his greed has been so stimulated by the immense increase in the price of grain in 194&amp; that it is now, as Mr* Vivian says# impossible* to do ousinese with him on any reasonable terms* ibay further price cox^ession now would oxily lead to nig nor demands. What is required is some method at 1 compulsion which could d© applied to the landlords without injury to the bulk of the population. *».£ a class uny are lightly taxed; the logical solution is to impose on all laadl3i*ds a tax 01 qo much grain per acre of their agricultural property, pj^yable in kind, and without reference to grain deliver lea so far effected. But, as Mr. Vivian rightly paints out, a Majlios composed largely of landlords is not likely to impose such a tax, and in am case it would also require time. ^* *^ iiiUot record Mr* Vivian *3 conclusion ■snat the reports t,iven by the Minister of Supply after his recent tour in Azerbaijan were seriously misleading. He gstve out, fir in stance, that s stated quantity of wheat was immediately available at Ardeoil, wiiex*eas he had actually made a contract /for5 proved, abortive, if only because trje officer selected to serve as Gonsular Liaison Officer was, through no fault oi his own, entirely unsuitable. In view of the incom petence of the government and the dishonesty of officials it is, of course, doubtful whether even Anglo— Russian cooperation here would nave achieved much. I reported to you in ay despatch fio. 2b of August 26th that Mr. Moulagenkov was already pessimistic, that he judged it 'difficult indeed to try to enforce a law if the officials of the country do not try tteaselvee to enforce it.

(1) During the past week this writer has made a personal ^investigation of the Maragheh and Ardebil areas, which are the major grain producing regions of Azerbaijan. The exportable surplus from these two areas is indicated in the table below: Vheat Barley available to motor transports available to animal transports available to motor trans ports av ilnble to ? nimal trans ports Maragheh 90 4140 179 709 Ardebil 518 663 2811 1760 Total 608 4803 2990 2469 You will note from the above table that 4803 tons of wheat and 2469 tons of barley must be moved, from various government embars where it is stored at present, by *hiraal transports to a motor road. I have carefully computed the time element for thfcs and on a basis of seven camels carrying one ton it will take 4811 camels a period of 60 days, minimum, to move the 7272 tons of grain to Mianduab, Maragheh, and Ardebil where it will be accessible to motor transports. In the city of Tabriz today we have 448 tons of wheat,252 tons of barley and 336 tons of flour. This wheat and flour will supply the city for about 16 days. The barley is available for your forces. Information from the regions of Misneh, Maku, Shapur, Rezaieh and Khoi indicates that their total exportable surplus at the present is under 1000 tons. In addition certain local areas such as Rezyeh, Astara and Azershahr do not have sufficient wheat in their ambars for their own consumption until the new harvest. (2) We i I y /rj /i(2) re verify that drafts for Russian delivery have been sent to our locals for 2000 tons of wheat as indicated^n your letter of January 24th, and as follows: Tabriz. Ardebil Khoi .. Shapur itaku • • Rezaieh Marand B40 tons (draft .60 tons .300 tons 350 tons 150 tons 150 tons 150 tons withheld) Total 2000 tons Of this amount you have actually received to date less than 500 tons. Today we have issued a draft to our Tabriz silo to deliver you 300 tons of wheat over the next 6 days. ve under stand our locals have most of the above-listed wheat ready for delivery to your forces, but it h* s hot been accepted due to the fact that it contains excessive foreign matter and dirt. We have instructed our locals by telegraph to make every effort to clean the wheat locally. We believe that this can be done to your satisfaction and thus permit you to have the remainder of the 2000 tons very shortly and enable us to concentrate our limited motor transport on future deliveries. With regard to barley, delivery drafts were sent out to various locals before the contract became effective for a total of 5513 tons. Of this amount 2396 tons were delivered to you before Dec. 1st and are not to be considered nart of the contract delive ries. The retaining drafts for 2117 tons remain in force however, end to date you heve'received 1945 tons. e are preparing new b&lt; rley drafts after checking with our locals and we will submit these drafts for your approval and make them conform, in so far as possible, to the localities indicated in your letter of January 23r (3 ! At the moment we are doing everything possible to bring tk the Russian deliveries up to date. We have instructed our various agents to requisition every available animal for moving the grain from remote areas to a motor rood. 300 tons are being delivered to the port of Denalu on Lake Rezaieh for shipment to Tabriz by ships and railroads which ere under your control. Other lorries are moving grain from Bustanabad, Slab Chaman Turkoman Choi and Mianeh to Tabriz every day. Still others are concentrating on the Ardebil ares. Strict orders have been given that no grain can leave Azerbaijan for Tehran or any other point. The only exceptiC to this is the remaining 175 tons of the Kampsax contract rhieh we have pe'mitted to be taken south from Bustanabad to Zendjan for the workmen on the road. *65 are constantly In motion but their total capacity is about 425 tons Ardebii is at least a three day round trip and usually four or five days are necessary. However, we hope to bring a minimum of 3000 tone of grain to Tabriz during the month of February. Of this amount 1500 tons must be used for the city of Tabriz. T&lt;e are taking meens to lower the consumption of wheat throughout the province and this department has demanded that Maragheh produce an additional 8000 tons and Ardebii an additional 15000 tens over what hae already been sunrlied. Please be assured that this writer is as unsatisfied with the past Russian deliveries as you are and that every available means is being utilized to meet the contracted deliveries at the earliest possible date. Faithfully yours, The Director General of Sunply, ( zerbaijan) (Sgd.) Rex VivianFebruary 4th, 1943. To His Excellency, The Governor General of Azerbaijan, Excellency: In connection with our conversation of this morning, I am indicatidng herewith my recommendations for necessary action to be taken against delinquent landlords in the Tabriz area who, to date, have not delivered their total quota of grain to the Government. As Your Excellency is aware, the landlords fall into four xixsx ^ classes, as follows: engagement * 3. Those who refused to give engagements but have delivered a certain amount of grain. 4. Those who refused to give engagements and have delivered no wheat a£ all. With the first class Y/e are not concerned at this time, but the other three classes, withthe possible exception of certain individuals in class 3 who may have delivered the required amount of grain, definitely fall into the category of law violators. The records of Kharbar Department show that ill landlords were notified of the Engagement Law and were requested to give Engagements to the Government, amounting to 70 per cent of their total production. The original Millspough records were taken as a basis for assessing the amount of the total produc tion. In general it was decided that in addition to the Government’s 70 per cent of wheat, the landlord should deliver barley amounting to half his deliveries of wheat. Various attitudes were assumed by the landlords, resulting in the four present classifications indicated above. It is the view of this writer that no more time should be lost in taking drastic action against the landlords. The fact that a landlord has failed to give an engagement to the Government is a sufficient violation to bring about his immedi ate arrest and imprisonment. A landlord who has given an engagement but not fulfilled it, is equally guilty of deregard- ing the law. Your Excellency has been given a list of all the landlords owning property in the Tabriz area which also shows the amount of their deliveries and how much remains outstanding. You will observe that the Government to date has received 4S20 tons of wheat when deliveries should have been 9314 tons. A shortage of 5094 tons. We have received 1413 tons of barley when deliveries should have been 366S tons, a barley shortage of 2209 tons. In view of the above figures, I therefore request Your Excellency to order the Chief of Gendarmie and the Chief of 1. Those who gave engagements and fulfilled the same. 2. Those -who gave engagements but have delivered no grain or have only partially fulfilled the7 2 . S 1 !* ^epartiitent of Knaroar full coooafatioh and talc® iamadiao® steps to arrest and iiaprison over/ delinquent lonalora in the labriz area- In addition, I request.,.tl^at the rati jn cards lor Monopoly goods be seized from toe l^nilies of these landlords. The landlords may be released from prison when their quotas of grain have bean delivered to the Govern- i&amp;ent ambars. ihis writer concedes tiiat such drastic action will cause a certain amount of hardship to a few innocent landlords who £i *v &amp; delivered all the grain they are capable of producing, 0 til f re rtla ^. aav&lt;:J suffered bad crops or had their lands aevastaued uy bandits but I would draw the attention of Your ^xceliency to U&amp; fact that the Government in Azerbaijan is lacing an acute shortage of food, and it is better, in my opinion, th a t a few landlords be temporarily inconvenienced than to nave many more poor am needy people suffer the panrs 01 malnutrition, hunger and possibly starvation. 1 wish further to suggest to Your Excellency that ti^e position and prestige of hie Gentral Government of Iran is at stake. If landlords are permitted to scoff at Government regulation and laws, then Government becomes a mocker/ and laughing stock and this condition cannot be tolerated. I am well aware of iou r Excellency's desire to surmount tue present situation and it is with this in mind that I have oxfered tne above outlined suggestions. khkw thus opportunity, Excelleiicy, to renew assurances oi my nigheat consideration* faith!ally yours, The Director General of Supply and Finance * (Sgd*) Hex Viviani iv .j . . j 'u-i.

Cadogan s letter of 27th November ana my letter, of 18th January. + §• . M^orahdum, which was-..drafted before fall of Qawam, states that soviet Government share desire of His Majesty's Government to maintain Qav/am s Government in office. Soviet representatives in Persia have tried to prevent his resignation a.nd, with this in view, have assisted Persian Government to solve the food Question. Our information that they only permitted small qua.ntities of wheat +? i^- n sported to Tehran from Azerbaijan does not correspond to the facts. _ Soviet authorities have not only not obstructed movement of wheat from Azerbaijan to Tehran but have materially assisted it: Persian Ministry of Food have made official declaration which bears this out. Though amount of exports from northern provinces to Tehran cannot be exactly ascertained. Soviet Governinent estimate these exports at 20,000 tons of grain up to beginning of February (memorandum does not state from what date Zj a M} on ^*ade.) At present Tehran is being supplied with foodstuffs entirely from northern provinces. Reason why exports have-not been greater is failure of Persian authorities taKesuflieicntly energetic steps for purchase and transportation ol wheat. Consequence of this failure has been that stocks a.ccumula.ted m towns in northern provinces, and subauently moved to Tehran, have not been replaced. Soviet garrisons in these towns sometimes have sufficient provisions for only a few days. In such circumstances further movement of wheat from Azerbaijan, 1 a not accompanied by improvement in Persian Government’s arrangements for purchase of further stocks, would create dangerous situation and would have undesirable political repercussions. Adequate supply of food-stuffs in northern provinces is important factor in maintaining general political stability. ^ Soviet Government have therefore instructed Soviet Ambassador in Tehran to urge Prime Minister to order Governor General of Azerbaijan to take-decisive stops to obtain and transport surpluses to towns from outlying districts. Carrying out of these measures would also mean improvement in despatch of wheat from Azerbaijan to Tehran. ^ Wat' CoscLk^ A7 ^ u /3.5. koiaorand'ujii adds that Tehran’s food difficulties ire ^ 1 ^ • . j . r— ^ u x'jixxc.h o jl uuu u jlxi ±uu± ul&lt; 'r^ T r :L + sud £ y adequate arrival of. grain from Central ^ /V £ V' r ? + J Gr ^ lr -T Statement that Tehran is -normally sipi^nul v/ith v/heat only from the northern provinces is hv C -p^c?o’ Soyrct^authorities in Tehran have been informed -rsiar authorities that /Tehran .was formerly supplied mainly l,o% S nd in G ? diti on obtained from 30,000 t ?^ s .a 1 icoastuffs from ^rak, Kepanshah and Hama dan. 5° ? do f^9:§ G ln ^^ Gsc districts now is proved by the_ s^ct tnat food-stufis are being exported* to.

Our position vis-h-vis the Russians is as described in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 582 f of 24th January]. It is of course understood that all wheat shipped at expense of Russian supplies is for Persian civil requirements, and not for other Persian Gulf requirements (e.g. A.I.O.C. or British Army labour). 3. It would cause difficulties and delay if the Russians in Persia claimed the right to distribute this wheat themselves because it had arrived in Russian aid ships. It would therefore be well to ensure that wheat is so consigned that Russians cannot claim title to it. This point is particularly important since I understand that ships in question may also be carrying wheat for the Russians, 4, The present problem is essentially the same as tha.t which we have had to fane all along. Even where wheat for Persia can be shipped without encroaching on tonnage ear marked for Russia, it must still displace Russian supplies on Persian inland clearance. This was the sole reason for our reluctance to ship wheat before it was proved really essential to do so. Please impress this on State Department, who appear to have ascribed our earlier attitude to a desire to put political pressure on Persian Government.

Demand for wheat contained in mv teleg ram-No.^21 to. Minister of State, is reduced from 7,100 tons to 5,000 tons of wheat or wheat flour. Requirements for adulterants remain at approximately the same figure but owing to previous miscalculation of extraction rate, the demand is now for 16,500 tons of flour instead of 16,400 tons grain, . Of this not more than 2,500 tons can be millet flour which is said to have high extraction rate, remainder barley flour. These amounts are additional to 25,000 tons North American wheat, 3. .In agreeing to these figures Food Adviser has taken into account expected future deliveries of wheat to Tehran from Azerbaijan amounting to a maximum of 4,000 tons, any excess over this figure would mane possible a corresponding reduction in the 5,000 tons now required. Food Adviser, however, maintains that it is Persian negligence in the past rather than Soviet intervention that is the main cause of Azerbaijan’s failure hitherto to produce wheat.

Persian Gulf cerealsf^ Under 'ffeol?agreement it is clear that figures for imported requirements of cereals for the Persian Government given by Mr. Sheridan and agreed by United States Legation should be accepted. Requirement for Persian Government for the whole season is thus (a) 25,000 tons of wheat originally promised |bj 7,100 tons of wheat subsequently shown to be essential 24,000 tons of barley. 3. ' British Legation agree these figures and estimates on which they are based except for the assessment of deficiency amount of which they consider may be less than Mr. Sheridan* s figure. However the position is so serious that the only safe course'is to accept the figures in paragraph 2. 4. Latest information on supply position is as follows: quantities of overseas wheat and flour available for distribution m the Persian Gulf will be in February 5,000 tons and 2,800 tons in tankers; in April 4,700 tons plus February tankers if any. Total 19,500 [sic] tons. ^ 1 * ”■-^1 5. In addition Middle East Supply Centre is arranging for^v^ 11 ^' transfer early in February to the Persian Gulf 5,000 tons of flour from the Red Sea stocks which ‘will be available for distribution in the Gulf March and April. 6. No (repeat no) other supplies can be expected before May. Total available February to April inclusive will therefore be 24,500 tons.?7 n / 7. Middle/✓ 2 . ''Ns 7* Middle East Supply Centre propose to distribute these available supplies as rallows* 8.

Further assistance to Persian'Government will be provided by 2,500 tons British army flour which Paiforce has agreed to hold available for needs of the Persian Government and v/hich Persia will need to call on probably in February.’ 13. In addition every effort will be made to send Iraq barley and millet up to 16,000 tons for delivery by the end of April. Balance of 8’,000 tons against 24,000 tons requested will remain for delivery May to August. 14. In February to April inclusive therefore 15,100-tons of wheat and flour vail have been delivered to the Persian-Government which together with 2,500 tons delivered before the end of January . will make 17,600 tons delivered in all by the end of April against original 'undertaking of 25,000 tons* 15. 7,400 tons will then be outstanding to which must now be added further 7,100 tons making total remaining for- delivery between May and Auguf 6 14,500, say, 15,000 tons. ' , 16. Other demands for delivery May to August inclusive will be Paiforce for consumption 5,000 tons plus replacement of advances to the Persian Government 5,000 tons. Abadan 5,600 tons. Persian Gulf Sheikdoms 4,400 tons.. Total 20,000 tons. * I 17. In addition present situation demonstrates conclusively imperative needs for increasing loadings to Persian Gulf above current minimum requirements as early as possible in order to establish a working stock* 10,000 tons is the minimum figure.for this purpose. The need for a working stock is proved by recent event's e.g. (a) complete uncertainty of internal collections in \ Persia (b; addition of Persian Gulf Sheikdoms’ to Middle East Supply I Centre commitments at a time when stocks were’ so low that supplies could not be sent from abroad in time to prevent starvation (c) necessity of moving wheat from Red.Sea to Persian Gulf simply because no pool existed there to meet sudden contingency (d) delay and resultant difficulties in connexion with implementing promise .riven in Bandar Shahpur^in December to deliver 25,000 tons to Persian Govcrnmenx due' to the absence of any working stocks from which deliveries on account could be made. • 18. Total/V 3. Total requirement for delivery May to August incisive wheat to Persian Gulf is thus 45,000 tons. Corresponding loadings monthly are February to May inclusive. 19. These estimates make no allowance for sinkings and are throughout dependent on realisation of sufficient percentage of supplies of Iraqi cereals. 20. In order to give minimum security to Persian civil position programme for loadings to fulfil 45,000 tons for delivery May to August to Persian Gulf should be as follows: loading February 15.000 tons, March 15,000 tons, April 10,000 tons. May 5,000 tons. 21. I cannot over-emphasise the seriousness of this situation. I urge that utmost efforts be made to effect shipments accordingly. Already nearly two months have been lost since Middle East Supply Centre in Mast Mides No. 2257 gave warning of growing dangers of situation.

Food Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of the United States and, the Imperial Iranian Government. 1HE Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Government of the United States and the Imperial Iranian Government: Considering that the responsibility of feeding the people of Iran rests primarily on the Imperial Iranian Government, but that it is desirable, inasmuch as war conditions may bring economic distress to the people of Iran and inasmuch as it is the general policy of the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to safeguard the economic existence of the peoples of the Middle East against such distress, to take all possible steps to ensure the supply of cereals (wheat together with barley, rice and other adulterants) for the bread supply of the people of Iran until the gathering of the harvest in 1943, and Having regard to the undertaking given by the Imperial Iranian Government to carry out— {a) All measures recommended by the United States Adviser to the Ministry of Food, including measures to prevent hoarding and the introduction of rationing of food-stuft's, and (b) All recommendations of the Road Transport Committee which are certified to be essential for the regulation of the means of road transport in Iran by the majority vote of the following three members of that committee, namely, the chairman appointed by the Imperial Iranian Government, and the members designated by the United States and British Ministers at Tehran respectively, Have agreed as follows Article I. If the Iranian Minister of Food, with the concurrence of the United States Adviser, and the United States and British Ministers at Tehran decide, by a majority vote, that they are satisfied that all practicable steps have been taken by the Imperial Iranian Government under their undertakings referred to above, and that, nevertheless, the supply of cereals within Iran for the bread supply of the people of Iran is insufficient to cover the minimum needs of the population of Iran for the current year ending with the gathering of the 1943 harvest, the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom will take all steps within the full limit of their powers to ensure that supplies of cereals will be brought to Iran from other sources sufficient to make up the deficiency. Article II. The Imperial Iranian Government are responsible— {a) For the distribution of cereals within Iran; (b) For ensuring that a deficiency in one area is met by supplies from another area in Iran when the total supply of cereals within Iran is sufficient for the needs of the population of the country as a whole; and (c) For the distribution to necessitous areas of any supplies brought into Iran from other sources in fulfilment of the undertakings of the other two Governments in article-1 above. Recognising that the capacity of the Imperial Iranian Goverment to discharge its above-mentioned responsibilities is limited by the means of transport at its disposal, the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom will take all steps, within the full limit of their powers, to ensure that the means of transport at the disposal of the Imperial Iranian Government shall be sufficient, if put to the best possible use, for the proper distribution of these cereals. In witness whereof the undersigned, being duly authorised to this effect by their respective Governments, have signed the present agreement and have affixed their seals.Done at Tehran, this fourth day of December, 1942, in triplicate, in English and in Persian, both texts being equally authentic.

If it became necessary to import this amount, we hoped to supply the greater part in the form of barley from Iraq, but even this would affect the volume of supplies to the Soviet Union. In order to maintain supplies to the Soviet Union at the highest possible level* it was therefore most important that as much wheat as possible would be sent from Azerbaijan to Tehran and placed at the disposal of the Persian food administration. Soviet Government should therefore send categorical instructions for the promised grain to be collected and sent to Tehran at the earliest possible moment. Any difficulties could probably be overcome if Soviet authorities would co-operate closely with British American and Persian authorities in working out the necessary practical arrangements. 5.

According to United States Embassy, State Department have approved the joint recommendation of tne British and American Ministers in Tehran that 7,100 tons of wheat should be shipped from North America and 16,400 tons of barley from Iraq, in addition to the 25,000 tons already programmed. State Department urge that action should be taken as quickly as possible. 2. You will see from te legram No.,^ 48 55 Mast a [of 22nd January] to Sir A. Salter that, aTa result of the drastic cuts which will have to be made in shipments to the Middle East, it is impossible to complete the shipment of even the original 25,000 tons of wheat without cutting into tpnnage allocated for the carriage of supplies to Russia. This naturally applies also to the additional^, 100 tons. 5. I have made it plain to the Soviet Ambassador on more than one occasion that if, as‘a result of Soviet purchases of cereals in North Persia we are obliged to import cereals from aoroad, these imports can only be made at the expense of supplies to the Soviet Union, owing to the limited inland clearance capacity of the Persian ports and railways. I d.o not therefore propose to say anything further to the Ambassador. 4* Please explain to the State Department that while we also approve the recommendations made in Tehran, we can only arrange for the shipment of this wheat at the expense of Russian supplies. It is important that there should be no misunderstanding on this point. [ECd.

Squire is now in Cairo and has given following information and views in reply to questions raised in above telegram; further discussions between Middle East Supply Centre and representatives from Bagdad and Tehran being held this week to clarify, supply position. 1. The original plan is in full force but is inadequate to effect any change in the situation which briefly is that holders of wheat stocks are unwilling to sell'to Government at'the Government price and that Government is too weak and too corrupt to compel them to do so. 2 . This unwillingness is due to:~ (a) The universal desire of individuals and localities to safeguard their own supplies and keep a reserve in hand against eventualities before parting with any surplus. (b) Distrust of the Government and determination not to part with wheat at the Government price merely to enable a gang of greedy officials to fill their pockets by malpractices of every sort.. The provinces are notoriously jealous of Tehran in particular. (c) The knowledge that if.famine conditions can be artificially induced famine prices are bound to follow with tremendous profits for every hoarder who can hold on to his wheat until such conditions arise. 5. No amount of planning or legislation can by itself over come these difficulties. Government must be strong enought to enforce its plan or it must be able to break the rmgjby large scale imports. Neither of-these conditions exist. Therefore, Government, being bound to provide bread'for tho people, is compelled to adopt other expedients to coax out the required wheat. These expedients vary from province to province. (a) In Khuzistan, where there is an undoubted shortage, the Government has given up all attempt to provide any wheat and .the bakers of Anwaz and Khoramshanr, the two princioal towns, are given permits to buy what they can in the open market. The Governor-General is commonly reported to share largely....wmmmmm ( 2 ) largely in the very considerable profits involved. All the same, bread has been produced for the towns v/ithout undue difficulty though at an exorbitant price. The cost of wheat is about £80 per ton. '(b) In Isfahan and Shiraz, where considerable quantities of wheat are known to exist, Government is still unable to close the black market as it has not the reserves to supply the people's needs. Organised societies are therefore given'permits to buy. In Isfahan where Colonel Robert, bur C.L.O., has taken unofficial control, these societies have now got in enough stocks to.last for some time. Colonel Robert has been.able to secure indirect control over these stocks and by his- personal prestige has also secured considerable quantities from the landowners at the official price, thus belying the experience in several other Middle East countries but causing no surprise to those acquainted with their 'Haii Baba*. As a result a real attempt to close down on all black market transactions in the whole province is being made to take effect from January 20th. (c) In Kerman few if any purchases on the open market have been attempted. Our C.L.O. has succeeded in getting in the greater part of the landlord's assessed surpluses, though he admits that the assessments were too lenient in most cases, but he cannot do more, with the result that the province shows an estimated deficit of 5,500 tons'. (d) In the surplus areas of Kermanshah and Kurdistan and Ramadan in the west and in Khorasan (Meshed) in the east the experiment of offering a bonus to selected agents for all wheat which they can purchase at the Government price on Government behalf has been tried but without much * success, and in Kermanshah it has already been abandoned as a failure. (e) In Azerbaijan no special measures seem to have been taken to secure the harvest and we are unable to get any reliable information how much of the crop has been purchased by the Government. It is administrative chaos rather than the inadequacy of the Government price which seems to be the chief cause of Government's failure here. 4. The above account will give some idea of how far the Government are going or can go in becoming the sole purchasers of wheat and other cereals. 5. My paragraph 2. The 20 per cent reduction was due to take effect from December 20th. Great pressure was brought to bear on Sheridan to postpone it and he has been compelled to give way specifically in Ramadan where a new Governor has just been appointed in the hope that he may succeed where others have failed. It may be assumed that the reduction will not in fact be effective anywhere. 6 . My^ paragraph 5. The situation in Azerbaijan is as obscure as it Is unsatisfactory.• The Russian attitude is one of self-righteous adherence to the terms of the treaty v/hich forbids .them‘to interfere in any way in the internal administration of the country. They therefore decline to take any.... —M ■■■■■■■ (3) 4 7 any open interest in the collection of wheat ? though they ao on various pretexts attempt to stop its export to the south. Unless Russians undertake to co-operate, it is highly improbable that more than 5 or 4,000 tons will be eventually available for Tehran. 7* My paragraph 4. A statement of_the main movements of wheat from the provinces to the capital up to date has been supplied* There are no other major movements to report. 8 . RICE. The Persian Government have monopolised the purchase' of the lowest grade rice only in the northern province of Gilan and Mazanderan, There should be at least §0,000 tons of this available to the Persians over and above the Russians’ requirements. How much the Persians have bought or can buy and whether they will be able to move it to Tehran remains to be seen. The Persian Government have not monopolised the purchase of higher grade rice in these provinces nor the rice of other areas such as Isfahan (where the price is £100 a ton) and Khuzistan. It should be easy for the Persian Government to collect a total of at least 1,500 tons a month over the next 8 months, but it would be rash to count on their being able to do so. 9. My paragraphs 6 , 7 and 8 . General supply position and related questions of barley and millet requirements will be subjects of detailed discussion this week, but Squire s assessment agrees closely with provisional figures contained in my telegram No. 87 to you.. 10. Regarding possibility of further imports. Squire considers whether or not these are bound to be supplied under the Food Agreement is open to argument. He maintains that this question is largely academic since the Persian Government well know that starvation and food riots cannot be risked on an L. of 0. He suggests, however, that further assistance should in any case be conditional on the Persian Government agreeing to give our C.L.Os* in provinces where they^exist or may henceforth be appointed, authority to act as unofficial advisers to the governor in all matters connected with wheat and transport with the understanding that their advice will be accepted. C. L. Os .^JiayQ without any authority already accomplished much aiKTTis convinced that the grant of real authority will be of further assistance to the country in inspiring the confidence which is so essential a iactor in the wheat situation. 11.

Stocks of wheat exist in Bi jar &lt;*nd further west and also in khorassan, but the delays in organising transport have seriously prejudiced the chances of maintaining a sufficient supoly from these areas for the next two months, until the 25,000 tons now promisee from abroad begin to arrive. The situation in kermanshah and kurdistan is as bad as ever, and without executive authority successive G.L.l.s h-ve been unable to effect any improvement. Of the two agents appointed by the Ministry of i upply to purchase wheat, the one in kem*nshah has failed entirely and has been dismissed, aid the other in kurddstan, reporting that he has purchased nuny thousand tons over the requirements of the district, seems actually to have produced practically nothing. H-madan is a little better, and Sdrdar Jcrum Gharagozlou, one of the leading landowners of the district, has new bean sent as Governor with specific orders to produce as much wheat as possible for Tehran. He has promised to folio// the advice of the G.k.G* in fulfiMing this task. The report made last month that this family had produced 12800 tons was inaccurate. The Deputy sent to Humadan to negotiate reported that the landowners had promis ed to produce an additional 2800 tons over and above their promised under takings of 10 ? oQ0 tons, provided that the Government price was raised from 300c to 3500 itials per ton in this district as in kermanshah. The price was raised but the promise, k like most Persian promises, remains unfulfill ed. o*ak has been hied white and can do little more for Tehran, and will in fact j be unable to get through the winter without the promised repayment of the loan 6f 500 tons to the capital. Of this there seems no prospect at the moment* The one bright spot is Isfahan, where Golonel Robert, with the delighted approval of the Governor-General and Head of the i’ood Department, has assumed virtual control and has already done much to secure the city's m supplies* If he is successful in producing any considerable quantity of millet and maize, .aid is allowed to purchase rice at the very high price at present prevailing in the open market for adulteration purposes, there seems no reason why he should not be able to assist the more needy regions in the loath.

In .zerbai^an the situation is confused. Monsieur i’arrukh, the Ministf of m apply t has just returned from a tour of the area -.nd reports that hw &gt;as arranged to provide the needs of the province, the 5000 tons of wheat c*nd barley required by the Hussions with a surplus of 4000 tons for )| Tehran. it is improbable that this report is correct, and little hope is II row entertained of any surplus being obtained from that area for Tehran; &lt;'luti Mr 9 nheridan is endeavouring to send a youag aaericon, Mr* H. Vivian, whom he has engaged as his assiot^nt, to organise matters in Azerbaijan, but it is still uncertain whether the Hussions will allow him to work in their zone. .-ast Iran remains our chief hope. ilia Majesty^ Jonsul-General is doing his best to provide a, surplus from Shorassaii for Tehran, and a reliable Indian merchant has on our advice been given a contract to purchase all surplus stocks in Sidtan, which should amount to 5000 to 4000 tons and chould be sufficient to cover the deficit at least of Kerman. help, as crops there are reported to be good this year, and there should be a considerable surplus on our eastern border.

Full proposals will be sent later, after further discussions with other representatives from Tehran and Bagdad at .the end of r this week. Meanwhile the following provisional figures will serve as a guide to action suggested 'in paragraph 6 following. 'V ■ * i » , 2, In order to feed deficit areas from January 1st up to the end of August next, by which time the 1943 harvest should-be definitely coming into the Government*$ hands, it is estimated that 60,000 tons cereals will be . required for'Tehran and 6,000 tons for the-Bushire and Shiraz districts. 3* On present evidence, possible supplies against these requirements are: (a) 15,000 tons from the remaining surpluses in the districts other than those occupied by xhe Russians, though Sheridan estimates quantity so available at 24,000 tons. (b) 25,000 tons promised in declaration, assuming P.A.I.C. finally confirm they do not require re-payment of 2,200 tons of flour already advanced. Their agreement will no doubt be conditional on regular provision for their requirements. t \ * 4. On these indications, estimated remaining deficiency of 26,000 tons will have to be ..met either by transfer of cereals from Russian zone or by importation. 5 . I consider it essential to clear up the situation vis-a-vis Russia immediately. Present position is that Persians blame the lack of cereal receipts from Azerbaijan on Russian obstructiveness, whereas the Russians claim they have no objection to movement of cereals and that tne failure is due to Persian incompetence in obtaining the grain.6 . I feel no further progress can be made in Tehran and that the matter must be put before 'the' ■Russians in London and Moscow as aclear^cut issue to state whether they are prepared to take the necessary steps to ensure delivery of wheat and/or rice from the north to Tehran or,if they prefer it, to acquiesce in the fact that importation of cereals to Tehran must necessarily reduce our aid to Russia* 7. I think it possible that the Russians still consider the bottleneck is shipping space and that if we were willing we could supply cereals to Persia without affecting aid to Russia, whereas in fact the bottleneck is the railway north from the Gulf ports, and whether_imports of cereals are from overseas or from Iraq they will have the same adverse effect on supplies to Russia. 8 * Rice surplus in Gilan and the south-west Caspian is reckoned to be about 50,000 tons, of which 30.000 is earmarked for Russians. Wheat surplus in Azerbaijan^conservationjis now placed at 15,000 tons. 9. ; If. Russians will actively co-operate to deliver 26,000 tons of wheat and/or rice from horthem provinces to Tehran, we may reasonably hope that the 25.000 tons already promised to Persia will sufficiently cover Persian needs up to the 1943 harvest, provided the Russians- take steps to start delivery by the beginning of March. • 10. If these supplies are not forthcoming from northern Persia and estimates of requirements and of other supplies given in paragraphs 2 and 3 (a)‘.above are confirmed, further imporxs will be necessar/. 11. Should any further promises of imports be . contemplated, I strongly urge xhat such promises should be for cereals and not for wheat as such. It is probable that stocks of v/heat do exist in Persia and it would be preferable, if supplies are obtainable, to provide Iraqi barley or millex to cover any further deficit's. This will save shipping space, stave off starvation by making barley or millet bread available to the poorer classes and lead the richer classes to seek wheat locally by every means in order to obtain a more palatable bread.

The Minister of Supply's whirlwind «. tour of Azerbaijan and replacement of incompetent officials has done nothing to improve the wheat situation there. Sheridan Is now trying to‘ send his American assistant to ensure deliveries, but the Russians reludant to issue pass, and in spite of the Soviet Ambassador's renewed assurances, the conclusion is almost jJunavoidable that they do not intend to allow removal of Azerbaijan /1 wheat for Tehran. It is suggestive that the new Governor-General * seems to be as obstructive as his predecessor. 4 ~ , * . V r . ^ \ , J v / . • t 2. The only other surplus areas (excluding Sistan which should supply Kerman and the south; ?are] Khorasan and western districts of Kermanshah, Khurdistan and Hamadan. Khorasan has some 2,000 tons, for the .movement of which movement control are asking P.A.I. for assistance which I earnestly hope will be immediately afforded. In the west the existing confusion is now aggravated by the blocking of roads with snow but efforts are at last being made to bring in the 2,000 tons of wheat which for many weeks we have been urging the Persian Government to move by animal transport. 3, Collections in all these areas are still most unsatisfactory and/ l RECc, POL.

He has also put forward plea for additional^shipment of 20,000 tons, I have long foreseen this failure and still consider that controlled purchase in open market would allev§®te the situation and should be tried before the demand for further shipment is accepted, I am also urging the Persian Government to use* our Consular liaison officers more fully to strengthen provincial administration. 1. Meanwhile we must again help as far as we can. If it appears t possible M,E,«S f C, will‘release few hundred tons from ships now due the gull though this will worsen the forward position of supplies for iinglo-Iranian Oil Company and P.A.I. civil labour. It would also greatly assist if India could re-examine the position/ and lend immediately at least 3*000 tons of wheat or flour against replacement ex the 23,000 tons now promised to the Persian Government, first consignments of which, cannot be-expe-oted until the end of February, The Persian Government have further asked if /Afghanistan can assist with wheat on the Meshed or Sistan border.- 3. I would further propose that P,.A.I, should immediately establish in Tehran under army control a small reserve of 500 tons which could be released at my discretion in emergency should rioting appear imminent as the result of further governmental failure. The Persian Government would not (repeat not) be informed of this. To save time suggest release ex base supply depot ^hwaz. 6, Barley' 1 now received from Iraq should be sufficient for adulteration until the end of January after which Tehran could use 2,500 tons monthly.

Credit must be given to Agha All in sour and Ayha i’ar^ad for the substantial coll actions detailed a x)ve. fast s: ring there was every prospect, judging by the scandalous manner in which the Finance and economic officials and tJieir confederates mlea^propriated imported as well as indigenous wheat stock®, that they would conceal most of the 1942 crop, however^large, if left to themselves. The Governor-General by taking a .eeu interest in the question and a strong line with the Finance departmente mentioned (he got rid of the notorious Dehemi and persuaded Far^&amp;d to co-oporatcj, has rescued, part at any rate of the surplus. It must in ^ujesmo^red that he had only the existing machinery to u.^e arid the Hcza Ghah system (a bad one certainly) to follow.

Ho money was provided to pay at this price, largely owing to obstruction on the part of the Minister of finance, since summarily dismissed from office. On the contrary, orders were issued that the new prices were not to be paid either to tenants (this presumably was the result of protests on the part of landlords who had leas ed their lands at fixed rentals based on the old prices) or to defaulters of the last two years. Nothing could have been better calculated to sabotage the whole scheme than this order. These mistakes have now been rectified, but an invaluable month has been lost and it is impossible now to make up for the damage done. had the loo&lt; 1 authorities been ready with cash to pay on the spot at the new price for all deliveries made to them, the results, at least in the cheaper t ~reas, might have been very different. ^ 3. There has been no improvement in the situation in Tehran. Ihe 3.500 tons of Iraqi barley which were promised in September and October and on which such great hopes were placed, has still not materialised, and Tehran continues to subsist on a narrow margin. after prolonged negotiaticrE the Russian attitude has improved, but no food exports from or through their zone are to be permitted unless covered by permits from the Ministry of iTcod, It a till remains to be seen how this scheme will work and 150 lorries full of wheat from khcrassan are at the moment being detained by the Russians because the forms which have been accepted as valid by them have not yet readied Meshed. energetic action, including action against hoard ers in the neighbourhood ox Tehran, does appear to have succeeded in collect ing the greater part of the surplus grain, and Tehran itself has been fed on local resources for to 30 days longer than is usual, and this in spite of the largely increased consumption due to the great influx from the neighbouring villages. Collections probably amount to between 5,000 and 7,000 tons more than any previous year. 4. The situ ,tion in kermanshah shows little improvement. Orders have been given that our officers should concentrate their efforts on endeavour ing to obtain the wiliwcooper tion of local officials rather than on forcing them against their wilS^to take unpopular measures which ere not certain to receive effective support from the Central Government. Mr. Sheridan, realising that in thiss areas at least the official policy cannot succeed, has appointed agents to buy all the wheat they can get, nominally at the official price, by offering them large bonuses increasing proportionately to the quantities purchased. This supercedes the previous arrangements whereby purchases were to be m .de by agents appointed by the Bank Melli, whose activities are now confined merely to the provision of the necessary funds. The agent appointed for Kurdistan reports that he has been able to increase the undertakings delivered by landlords by 75&gt;, but no figures of actual purchases have yet been received from either Kurdist&lt;cn or Kermanshafc. In Hamadan threats and a bribe of 5&lt;)0 rials kxbe and a ton over and above the official rate are reported to have extracted 1^,800 tons, maiftiy from the wealthy Gharagozla family. 'This wheat, however, has not yet been actually collectei or brought in am^r, Bherltod has c.greed that nons bh# be sent to Tehran until ail local nee as have been fully covered, arak (Bultanabadi has continued to be Tehran’s main standby, and has provided 1.500 tons for Tehran, though not without a struggle. A three day strike was engineered, probably by the Governor himself, as a protest against Tehran 1 s- 2 - © M Tehry-n*s demands, but was qaiokly settled by a personal visit Irom Mr. oheridan, who was able to allay their fears that the town would be allowed to starve. Mr. Sheridan gratefully acknowledges the good work being done in this area by the Consular liaison Officer, Mr. Bourne. In Isfahan Jolone1 Robert continues to show great energy both in inducing tribal leaders to produce wheat end in himself discovering hidden hoards, Given another month of freedom from interi.erence on the part of General ^ahidi e feels confident that he weidlife 1 be able to gather in enough wheat to feed^be city through the winter, but it is unlikely that any surplus for British road labourers or for the needs of Yezd will forthcoming. Kerman, tie only other area where we have a Consular liaison Officer, will still require outside assistance to the extent of 2,000 to 3,000 tons. About half of this amount might be obtainable locally if the Government would only try to purchase on the black market, where the current price is 4,500 rials, ae opposed to the official price of 3,000 rials a ton. In addition to his ordinary activities, Captain Hasson, the Ccnoular .iaison Officer, is interesting himself in the proper distribution of the seed wheat from India which has been allotted to this area. p* In areas where we have no Consular liaison Officers at work there is little change in the situation. In azerb&amp;kjan fears that the Russians will take all the surplus have naturally had an adverse effect on collections Mack of transport and official corruption have helped to produce a most unsatisfactory situation which Mr. Sheridan is trying to improve. He has recently obtained sanction for eight ^nuerican assistants to work in the provinces and hopes to obtain one locally for Azerbaijan in the very near future. His Majesty's Consul-General in Khorassan has just paid &amp; visit to Tehran where he has had discussions with Mr. Sheridan. as a result he hopes that it may be possible to persuade the Governor-General to cooperate more fully in obtaining a higher surplus for Tehran. a report from received from Kabul shows that with efficient organisation an exportable surplus of over ^,000 to 6,000 tons might be obtained from this area. This would suffice not only for the needs of Kerman but also for our road labour and possibly for fezd, which is already in difficulties. The small province of Birjand which is under the control of Rhaukatxl-a 1 -MuIk and is often a deficit area,’ is in the happy position of having sufficient crops in its own area to be independent, .nd irraajM«|nts ..re v.crking smoothly. 3haukat-ul-Mulk has refused to allow local/to fake any notice of Tehran's new prices and all the wheat_required has been obtained at the old price of about 1.660 rials on interfereing and upsetting this happy arrangement.■ ..mvjmszmmmm /f. 7 ft it, Cfa:, (This document must he paraphrased if communicated to any person outside Government service.) &lt; / [En Glair. ] DEPARTMENTAL NO. 2 . ■w* FRCM TEHRAN TO CONSULAR POSTS IN PERSIA . \ Ip / / 1^ '*** r Sir R.

Other imports through Russian zone are still subject to delays and since Friday, owing to exhaustion of stocks, Government has been com pelled to reduce supplies of bread in Tehran. (b) First 10,000 of 25,000 tons now promised in Food Agreement is being shipped from Canada, but cannot arrive until January to March. To tide over difficulty. Army has agreed to loan 1,500 tons of flpur from existing stocks and 3,500 tons barley promised from Iraq is now awaiting transport at Basra, (c) Middle East Supply Centre aim at building up a reserve in the Persian Gulf, but at the moment stocks are barely sufficient for current requirements of A.I.O.C. and Army labour in Khuzistan. (d) Promised import of 25,000 tons in no way minimises necessity for every effort to extract greatest possible quantity from all areas. On the contrary, now that His Majesty f s Government have accepted a contingent obligation to ship wheat to [word illegible], we have a still more compelling interest to see that the Central Government and the local authorities do their very utmost to meet their own needs and that American Adviser and nis assistants keep them up to the mark, I rely on you and on CLOs to spare no effort to ensure maximum production, and best possible distribution of cereals in your area. 2.

(Situation is explained in part 3 of my tale gram ^ No,g 142 9)» We believe this estimate to be correct. The Persian Government say it is greatly exaggerated and have hitherto done little to enforce collections. There is however undoubtedly much wheat immediately available in Azerbaijan and Farrukh Minister of Food left Tehran on December 11th for Tabriz to insist on greater zeal on the part of the local authorities. . We have asked His Majesty's Consul-General to keep in touch with him. 2. I am in constant touch with the Soviet Ambassador on all matters connected with wheat and have pressed him almost daily to overcome local difficulties. Sheridan discusses all questions fully with the Soviet Trade Delegation in whose sincerity he continues to express complete confidence. We can only hope for improvement. 3. The only barley to reach Persia from Iraq so far has been 1,500 tons for seed. Balance of 3,500 tons is still in Basra but we hope to obtain it shortly.

Suggestion that despatch of -flour and barley to Persia was deliberately delayed in order to put pressure on the Persian Government is entirely baseless. The delay is^ presumably # attributable to the same causes as delays of which the Russians complained. It has been most embarrassing to me since it was bound to be attributed by outsiders either to ill-will or to incompetence or neglect and in fact Sheridan has made allegations to this effect. A quantity of barley apparently [grp. undec.]000 tons was held up at Basra for cleaning. Why it took from Tehran, I cannot say. This Legation did everything to hasten j, despatch, including the provision of information, on which'Lord^ ^ Moyne who was here sent personal telegram to General Wilson, ana r ■ 3^. despatch of member of Middle East Supply Centre personnel to ba by special R.A.F. aircraft on December 12th to represent the urgency of the matter. Both these measures had f good effect. The military authorities even stopped other loading and v/orked all night to despatch the flour by rail to Tehran. 2. Before seeing the Shah and the Prime Minister on December 9th I had conference with senior members of the Legation and noted down roughly about a dozen points as a basis for intended conversations. To'ensure diplomatic co-operation as usual 1 went over the points with the Soviet Ambassador and^found him in t agree ment and to save time sent the Counsellor to discuss the points^ with the United States Minister, who was ill in bed. Mr. Dreyfus raised no objection although he added, two points: 1) severe punishment of hoarders 2) some form of control of the Majlis (on the second point, he has I am glad to say outrun his Government). The line taken about wheat was rather this: 'Q has co-operated with the Allies and thereby secured valuable agreement providing for wheat supplies from^America and His Majesty’s Government, yet circles by no means friendly to the Allies are trying to overthrow him on the cry that he is /responsibleresponsible for shortage of bread. Factious Majlis and black mailing measures could not secure, such an agreement nor could we co-operate with the same confidence with.hostile circles in our efforts to maintain bread supply' 1 . 3. Finding the Shah frightened if not repentant, I bore lightly on this‘fopic and I forgot even to mention it m my report on the interview. There was no threat , to 'withhold supplies and I am sure that the t Shah did not think there was.' With the Prime Minister I was naturally entirely sympathetic that he should be so unjustly blamed for the shortage of bread* 4, Except for Azerbaijan, where there is a separate wheat problem, the Americans have no representatives in the provinces and therefore no first hand informants as to local wheat supplies and local officials* slackness, corruption and indifference to the public interest. The American Legation are always inclined to be more lenient with the Persians ^ in this, matter than we are, though whether this is due to a spirit of contradiction, desire to appear more generous than the British, more correct diagnosis of the situation, or a slighter regard than we^ have for the need to save shipping, I should not like tosay. May I add that all information provided by our consular liaison officers is placed at Sheridan's disposal and that we work in the closest co-; operation with the American Legation in all matters, particular ly food and transport.

I understand that this suggestion was originally made when official buying price of wheat was £ 11 , as an alternative to purchase in rials on the black market. Now that price has been raised and operations on the black market discouraged, proposal loses its point and would not I think be acceptable to the Persian Government. 2 . I am myself not in favour of the proposal for the following reasons: (a) if we purchase wheat for gold only we may find ourselves obliged to pay in gold for everything we want. (b) if we pay for this year’s crop in gold we shall have to do the same next year. (c) if we pay in gold in Persia, we should probably have to pay in gold everywhere m the Middle East. (d) quantity of gold needed to pay for wheat crop in Persia (much more for the whole of the Middle East) would constitute serious transport problem, and we could no longer reasonably decline to bring to Persia her Financial Agreement gold (see your telegram No. 1509 paragraph 5). 3 . Hie argument for payment of gold is presumably based on the greater attractiveness of gold to the oriental but I doubt if gold would tempt the hoarder to disgorge. Very high price might draw out some wheat but rials should be as effective as gold so long as those who want gold can buy it. I should therefore prefer that gold should be brought in and sold on the open market as recommended in my telegram No. 135&amp;* [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong]. / sjy / ?.

I confirm request for 150 vehicles, provision of which will greatly ease transport shortage and will also imple ment plans to provide essential vehicles. Census now finished in Tehran and number of lorries (including United Kingdom Commercial Corporation) registered was 927 of which 82 belonged to the Government. Statement that no orders for census had been given is not understood. The Census in the provinces not yet finished, difficulty of postal communications (itself a result of lack of transport) having retarded arrival of necessary documents. 5. Road Transport Board has been reconstituted by decree and with the consent and full approval of the British and American Legations and Lend-Lease representative and regular meetings are now being held. Persian Government have promulgated its regulations, copies of which were sent you with my despatch to the Foreign O ffice No. S421 Dec ember_I0th, and these will come into force in the next few^days. The Persian Government Road Transport Department, have been able to contract another 100 vehicles making a total of 300 and with- the enforcement of regulations lorry owners have no other alternative unless permitted by Road Transport Board to contract their vehicles to United Kingdom Commercial Corporation or Iransovtrans. 4. Suggestion in Paragraph 4 that United Kingdom Commercial Corporation should contract additional vehicles for Persian Civil use is strongly opposed by Road Transport Board, as Persian Government Road Transport Department must have control of its own fleet. This will save demands on United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and simplify organisation. Arrangements with Movements Control, Tehran to use United Kingdom Commercial Corporation vehicles for back-loading will be adhered to. 5# We cannot emphasise too strongly that Road'Transport Board must be given the chance to contrpl Persian Civil transport, and to control independent fleet of civil vehicles otherwise it might as well bo dissolved.

' [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong].British Legation, Tehran. y 2nd ioveiaber, 1942 Sir, X have the honour to enclose herein a copy oi 1 a letter dated the 24th October from Mr. Sheridan, summarising tne wheat situation in Persia. The crisis which has since developed has made parts of this letter somewhat out of date, but comments on some of the details may be of Interest. The estimated surplus' in the various provinces made in paragraph ^ oi this letter correspond sore or less with our own conclusions, . except that hhorassan should be able to provide more than the 15, ) tons estimated, and that the Uamadan area, which should have a surplus of some 10,000 tone, has been omitted. • 2. The statement in paragraph 3 that all the Southern provinces are bordering on famine is somewhat exaggerated. There are and will be local shortages in these areas, especially in the neighbourhood of Buahire, but if the local administration, with advice from us, can be persuaded to act honestly and fairly, it should be possible, with the aid of stocks which we are importing for the labourers employed by us and by the Oil Company, for these areas to manage without too great hardship. 3. As regards the new regulations referred to in paragraph 7, I have already expressed grave doubts of the wisdom of raising prices in so sudden a fashion, and Mr. Sheridan U is himself beginning to repent of his haste. The difficulties along the Western border, and especially in Kermanshah, seem to have been aggravated and reports from Tabriz, which at first welcomed the decision, are now stating that a serious situation is likely to arise owing to the consequential all-round increase in the prices of other commodities. Mr. Sheridan’s confidence in the local Police officials appears a trifle optimistic, and we can but hope that it is not misplaced. 4. In view of the possibility that supplies of wheat and rice from the northern provinces may not now be forthcoming, Mr. Sheridan is naturally anxious not to permit the export Armies. If barley could be imported from Iraq immediately, this might possibly be used as a set-off against supplies of potatoes urgently needed by the British Army in Iraq, an arrangement advantageous to both parties. This matter is now being actively investigated. 5. Kvery possible help is being given by this Legation to Mr. Sheridan in his most difficult task. The reports of Consular Liaison Officers are placed at hia disposal, and he sees Mr. Squire and sometimes other members of the Legation nearly every day. The greatest task we all have to face is to induce the Persian Government to deal squarely and courageously with its own problems, but as I have reported in ay telegrams since the Russian demand for cereals has been made, (and it must quite obviously be met), there is certainly Justification for the Persian contention that they cannot manage without our assistance. of vegetables, especially potatoes, for the British and Russian 6./ The Right Honourable R.G. Casey, T )• •()., i .0*, Minister of state. QAlfiO .6. I am sending copies of this despatch with its enclosure to the Foreign Office, to the Secretary to the Oovernuient ^ of India in the‘External Affairs department, to his Majesty’s Arabsssador in Bagdad and to the Office of the Minister of State in Bagdad*COPY OF A L::TTi:;R From j J.P. SHKRIDAK, Adviser to the Ministry of Supply. To t H.K. Ths British* minister. Dated s 24th October, 1042. Your Excellency, Confiming my conversation with you on Wednesday night relative to the wheat situation, I now wish to summarise the situations* 2. From all figures given to me by British Consular representatives, our own field workers and from private sources, it appears that the maximum wheat surplus possible of export from the various Provinces to Tehran is as follows*- Azerbaijan Kast &amp; West 36000 tons Khorassan 15000 w Kbrdestan 3000 M Kenaanahah 3000 M Tehran area is still to collect 2000 ” A™k 1000 '' 3. fe will note that I make no reference* to any of the Southern provinces. ulte frankly, I cannot organise during this present Autumn crises any collection of surplus wheat from any Southern Areas for Tehran. All of the Southern Provinces are bordering on a famine stage more particularly Khuzistan, Fars, Kerman and Southern Baluchestan. Northern Beluchestan I am assured by the Governor will probably be taken care of from gabfiil re a. 4. From a political point of view the Tehran situation is the most pressing problem today; from the humanitarian point of view all of Southern Iran is equally serious. 5. I have been in the country exactly 4 weeks. Immediately upon my arrival I was fortunate in receiving the collaboration of Mr. Salman Assadi who has been granted the status of Under Secretary without the actual title. Mr. Aasadi . and myself have, from the commeucement, sought to organise the Ministry of Supply but confronted, as we were, with the pressing . problem of Tehran we have been compelled to put practically 100 percent of our time in feeding the 700,000 people of Tehran. 6. I have received every co-operation from the Government, from the Prime Minister down. Bach regulation and suggestion has been promptly accepted and put into immediate force. 7. I shall recapitulate the most important of the new regulationss- 1. The price Government was offering for surplus wheat on my arrival was 125 Tomans the ton; world price was approximately 400 Tomans; free market price and contraband price over the frontier to Turkey was 500 to 400 Tomans. After having the advice of Av* Kahn we resolved to increase the official price to 350 in the West Provinces and Tehran, Isfahan and Fars and 300 Tomans in the other Provinces. It is yet too early to state whether tills was wise, but certainly Government purchases of wheat around Tehran, Arak and Hamadan having vastly improved. 2./if / Police regulation was suggested by me and accepted by the prime Minister whereby seizure of any wheat f ^ flour or bread on any road in Iran was ordered unless transport is authorised by our Ministry and with - rewards of 20. of the value of the goods to any police Agent or member of the Gendarmerie m&amp;lcing the seizure* 3« Arrangements have proceeded under the guidance of Mr. Anderson of the Staff of the British Minister of State towards a strict ration scheme for bread in Tehran, later to be extended to the other cities in the country. Due to an accident to Mr. Anderson this scheme was slightly delayed, but he anticipates putting it into effect not later than 1st December. The further delay is due to the printing and distribution from house to house by census officials. 4. The organisation for receiving wheat and barley in Tehran has been completely changed, new management placed in charge of the Silo and Mill and within 48 hours of this change the reception of wheat and barley, the manufacture of flour and the mixing and delivery has been efficiently put into effect. 5. It has been resolved to make only one type of flour consisting of 70 percent wheat and 30 percent barley. This is not always possible however, because of the shortage of barley stock. 6. The system for distribution of bread in Tehran was most inefficient. I was gravely concerned with the pilferage, adulteration, trickery and general bad handling of tais important Department. With the help of the Tehran Police under the able guidance of Qeneral Hadsar a system is now in operation whereby for the present crisis, Police officials will take charge of the delivery of flour from Mill to the baker; strict control of the bakers themselves and more important and at the suggestion of General Hadsar himself a test will be made commencing Saturday, 24th October, in four separate areas of the town for the sale of bread by police officials themselves. X cannot compliment too highly the diligence of General Hadsar and the suggestions he himself has made in re-organising this Department. 8. All of the above refers to whet has been accomplished, but quite frankly, the organisation itself depends on supply of wheat and barley. 9 . if we are permitted by the authorities occupying the Northern half of the country to purchase wheat and without competition from their own purchasing agents and also granted the back loading facility of both railway and lorries, I am convinced that we can carry through the winter in Tehran. 10. In view, however, of the demands made upon this Ministry on Wednesday the 21st instant for arrangement to supply the Russian Army with food-stuffs including wheat, barley, and rice, I now feel that the Allied Nations must seriously consider their responsibility to Iran in so far as the ii^port into the country of such supplies of wheat and barley that will assure me of a safe-guard factor if supplies should be stopped at any moment. 11 In conclusion I wish to assure Your Excellency that 1 /no ..on all nciai/lonI em taking taa ucceb&amp;ary btepa to open ooup kitc^eno probably in tha bakery bfiops the&lt;aBtlves throughout the city at a fortnight* • notice* I cua planning on a diet in a fora of soup or vegetable stew consisting principally of potatoes, lentils and beans* At the present moment the crops 01 all these coiiuaoditiue are reasonably abundant, but I sai informed that the British Army has been steadily purchasing these iteiks for export to Iraq and I have written to the Comercial Secretary of the British Legation regarding this matter on the 20th instant. 12. Finally there is still one other possibility of relieving the situation. The rice crop in the two northern Provinces has been excellent. If no obstacles are placed in our way either as to quantity permissible of purchase # ana its transport to Tehran, the use of rice flour which can readily be milled in our own Mill, will relieve the situation considerably* 15. However, during the last week the prices of all vegetable commodities including rice have risex* tremendously. dice is a monopoly of the Government and I am giving instruction at once taut the entire crop must be purchased and forwarded to Tehran less the requirement© of the northern Provinces and of the necessary needs of the Russian Army. 14. This report is naturally somewhat incomplete, out I feel that I must place the situation before you so that your rtovernment will understand the situation and take necessary steps.

[Copies sent to Mr. Waley, Treasury.] O.T.P.COPY (E 6811/122/34) SOVIET EMBASSY 16th ^oveiaber, iily dear Sir Alexander, In reference to your letter of the 30th October, flo* b 63H/928/Q, on the instructione of ay Governtaent I have to reply as follows:- (1) The Soviet Government fully shares the viewpoint of the British Government on the neoeesity of settling the question of satisfying the needs of local currency. It has accordingly given the necessary instructions to the soviet Aobaasador at Tehran to mutually co-operate with his British and American colleagues in order to secure the necessary local currency required to supply Allied troops in Iran and for the transportatioi of goods to the Soviet Union. It is hoped that the oonoon efforts of the Allied representative® will secure the positive settlement of this question without having recourse to the forceful measures mentioned in the British ^ote. The Soviet Government is of the opinion that rials needed to cover expenses connected with the transportation of goods to the U.S.3.R. cannot cause considerable difficulties, and still less cause a critical situation in supplying the Allies in Iran with local currency. In settling the question of supplying Iranian currency to the Allies, it seems necessary to relieve, as far as possible, the apprehension of the Iranian Governaent which it voiced previously when a similar question was raised, lest the issue of rial notes in ever growing numbers without sufficient marketable commodities to cover it, would result in the deterioration of the rial with all the consequences it implies With regard to the statement contained in your letter that the Soviet Ambassador previously did not inform the British Minister, Sir Reader Bullard, about the draft financial agreement proposed by the Soviet Government to Iran, this appears to have arisen from the fact that until lately the British side in Iran did not convey any advance information to the Soviet Ambassador there on similar steps it was taxing. The Soviet Government full; shares the opinion of the British Government that it is desirable in future regularly to effect such a mutual exchange of informati The Soviet Government has already instructed its Ambassador in Iran to fully acquaint Sir Reader Bullard with the draft of the Soviet-iranian proposal concerning payments on the basis of which negotiations are being conducted now in Teheran between thu representatives of the Governments of the U.3.B.R. and Iran. {2) The Soviet Government notes with satisfaction the unity of the two Governments on the fact that at present after the harvesting of the crops, Iran has at her disposal a sufficient amount of wheat to s atiefy the needs of the populatior The difficulties which arose in the supply of cereals in some regions of Iran originated from defects in organising the collection of cereals and in the lack of sufficient transport facilities. With a view to overcoming the difficulties wnioh now exist in the supply of foodstuffs to Teheran, the Soviet Government informed the Government of Iran of its willingness to export from Iran-Azerbaidjan up to 35,000 tone of wheat for supply to Teheran from the surplus wheat now existing in that for the economic and political situation of the country region/ Hon.

According to Inforaatlon received the Iranian aovernaent h« 8 noooJeation to -tinff ihi« reauest of the Soviet Gove-nroent -or t e soppiy or iheat! barley and ?loe in the quantities stated above. Thus , it ie not possible to accept as correct the bout the Iranian authorities ® re “ lle 8 * i3 ^° b * ap ^*e® n *rIanisations thP, -jiipchases of wheat, barley and rice by soviet or fo aiii.y»wx In Iran resulting in worsening the deficiency ol c ® rea * 8 available for the Iranian population. The intended pur°ha.e of btSoO tons of wheat in ‘the Iranian—AzerbaidJan region for the supply to Soviet troops stationed there coincide., siauitaneouely with the export to horasan province °f * r * n f - £,000 tons of soviet wheat, in addi t ion t o .ore than 3,000 tone of wheat which were quite recentlysenttolran i ^ Soviet nion. The purchase ol lb ,000 tons of baifey as roa lor Soviet troops in Iran does not belong to the oate f 0 ^^ #rnr _ foodstuffe required by the population, ana thi “ be considered as a iaeasure which would aggravate tru. ic situation in Iraii. With regard to the purchase of 50,000 tons ot rice tor «xjort to the Soviet Onion, it iaiuet be noted that t riis transaction does not go beyond the normal U»U« *&gt; 00 ^® turnover between the soviet Onion and iran. Jteieover, in former years Iran expertised quantities of rice to the Soviet Union considerably in excess of 50,000 tons* The Soviet Government notes with satisfaction y°^ 1 ' ctatement that the British Government propose to import ir the near future 20,000 tons of wheat. This imports* ion im heli' 10 a certain degree , in eatl^iog the increased needs of Iran for foodstuffs as a result of the increased nuaber of Allied troops stationed t .ere, and of the prolonged . tay in tran of a considerable nu.ber of poles who were evacuated fro. the U.S.S.K. The Soviet uovernaent begs to note the inioraation that the British Government, in consultation with 01 the United States of America, is considering isfe.i .t -- „ in which these two Governments will undertake tne Iran until the new crops are gathered. At the same ii»e Soviet aovernaent cannot but express its .urprl.e at the statement that if the soviet military units in northern ^ ran wiii*inffuture be supplied from local resources, then the ' ne’essary importation of oereale in Iran will be made at the «nense of a corresponding reduction in A nglo-Amer.can supplies I^the ‘ a. The soviet Government is of the opinion that r. atVriuln and Ih. United Utates of America are very ..11 aware of the food difficulties of the ‘n* temporary loss of the northern uauoasus and the jK ^“ tne » , «tn«ouentlv thinas that British and American supplies of cereals to Iran should, under no circumstances, have an adverse «tieot on t£ a^nt ana in the time of a rrival of supplies to the UeI&gt;ekj | eKe Yours sincerely, (bigned) J.

As it is, Government have been obliged t 3 agree to the despatch to Tehran f»om /hwtos of 3,500 temn of Iraqi barley# the greeter part of which muot displace husEian supplies. The present stage of alarm in Tehran has uangerously weakened the position of ths Persian prims Minister, 1 UM, aovemaent agree with the oviot aovemment that his position should be strengthened, but oonsider that tills could best be done by assisting the Persian Govenuaent to aoeumulat* in Tehran a small resorv© of cereals sufficient for a few weeks# which would avoid the recurrence of tbs present state of psnia. It is therefore hoped that the soviet authorities In Persia will allow adequate quantities of wheat to be sent from thr ureas which they control to meet the needs of the capital, at least until the supplies for which H,K« Government hava omoiged begin to arrive, -....ui-renev 4 ccoruing to our latest infora, tion, the iwrsian prims Minister hus submitted to the Majlis to&lt;^iay a Bill living him full powers# which include liberty to increase the note issue.

So. 1732. London, 17th Koveafeer, 1942 j# dear Sir Alexanaer, I am very grateful for the information you gave me in our discussion yesterday and for your kind promise to look into the various pointe X raised, which, as you will he aware, pre-occupy the mina of the Iranian Government. I find that there are still a few minor points which I did not trouble you hy going fully into and some points which X find have not been explained in detail, so X thought it might he helpful to reiterate the various outstanding question© on which X sought your kind intervention. &amp;hile expressing my sincere thanks for the help which the British Government, as X learned from you, are endeavouring to render for the relief of the food situation in Iran, X should like to say that the solution of the whole problem seems to . require the simultaneous implementation of three measures. Firstly, the cessation of the exporting from Iran directly or indirectly of foodstuffs, in unauthorised ways, hy the Allied authorities. It is found that Iranian food supplies are still being taken out of the country hy unauthorised means, while the Government is deprived of control; even in the case of authorised exports, no payment is made in respect of prescribed dues and other charges. Full particulars relating to these unauthorised exports have been supplied to the British minister at Tehran, with the request for their cessation. Also, all depictions of Iranian food supplies either for the purpose of export or for the consumption of Allied troops and other foreign military and civil populations for whom the Allies ere responsible, to be avoided. Secondly, the facilitating of the conveyance of surplus agricultural produce from the northern provinces to the capital and other centres in need, and the abstention of interference by the Soviet military forces with the trans portation of these foodstuffs. Thirdly, the shipping to Iran as expeditiously as possible of a quantity of wheat, not less than 2b,000 tons (of which according to the information imparted by you, fortunately a good part is in process of being shipped and the undertaking by the Anglo-American authorities of the supply to each of the provinces badly in need of this commodity. The compensation by the British and American authorities even for the full quantity of food stuffs taken away by the Russians from Iran would hardly remedy the situation, and would leave a substantial deficit. Moreover, new Russian demands for 3 ,000 tons ol rice, 10,000 tons of barley, 5,000 tons of wheat and 20*100 tons of potatoes, add greatly to the already existing difficulties, v*the suddIv of these commodities, the Russians, it is In Sir Alexander Gadogan, G.G.M.G., Foreign Office, S. 1.1.In epite of the fact that the Iranian Government have acceded to the Ruealan request for potatoes and “barley, the Russians are now Insisting on obtaining wheat and rice as well* Needless to say this is impossible for Iran to deliver. The Iranian Government have ta&amp;en all necessary measures to counteract possible hoarding and to collect the full products of the country, and to introduce rationing. The American Adviser to the Iranian Ministry of Food is earnestly engaged in preparing a comprehensive report and determining the exact amount of the deficit of cereals in the country. The report, which is being prepared with the full support of the Minister of Food and the co-operation of all concerned, will naturally take some time, while the bread situation demands urgent relief, and the Iranian Government deem it essential that the supply of wheat from outside the country to Tehran be hastened without further delay. The Iranian Government, in reducing their request to the absolute minimum and after discusalng the whole question fully with the British and American Ministers in Tehran, reached an agreement with them on a draft Declaration, the details of which I presume are Known to you. This Declaration, which was considered to contain the absolutely essential conditions for ameliorating the situation, is now found inadequate to meet the pressing food problems owing to the considerable modifications now proposed by the British and American representatives, modifications which render the supply to Iran of the commodities in question rather uncertain. Moreover, the British and American representatives now wish to withdraw one of the essential points of the agreed Declaration by declining to undertake the supply of foodstuffs to the various provinces, leaving ite responsibility to the Iranian Government. The execution of this task might have been feasible if sufficient means of transpertation were placed at the disposal of the Iranian Government and in particular provided the Soviet anted forces did not prevent the despatch of supplies from one province to another. Mi The supply of the necessary quantity of wheat to Iran, which is so urgently needed, can hardly be connected in any way with the question of 'financing the expenditure in Iran of the Government of .the United kingdom', the advancing of Iranian rials and the issue of additional banknotes. It would seem advisable that the latter question, in itself a most difficult one, be solved separately, so that while the necessary Iranian currency is placed at the disposal of the British authorities, means can be devised for the return of its equivalent sterling value in the form of goods and materials, in order that the undue accumulation of sterling balances outside Iran and the devaluation of Iran’s currency may be prevented. This matter, which constitutes another very difficult problem, is now being rendered far more complicated by the Russians desiring to have a similar arrangement with the Iranian Government by which they wish to acquire Iranian rials against credits held in Moscow. I venture to make a personal suggestion in the w§y of s possible solution, to some extent, or the problem. Instead of a separate account to be held in London and Moscow to cover Allied expenses, would it not be more practicable for all concerned if there were to be one account solely in this cocn^fy. the Iranian Treasury could deal? Furthermore, that the British ^overament may see their way to aaalgn, at whatever eaorlfiee tome shipping spaa, necessary for a quantity of goods ofof various icinds to fce imported into Iran. ihie would certainly not amount to a very large Quota of shipping space and would not encroach in any substantial way upon the essential shipping apace of the Anglo-American war effort. ^ The Question of means of communication is another important factor, without which not only the adequate distribution of foodstuffs could not be assured, but the 1 &amp;ck of a sufficient number of lorries would, undoubtedly, interfere with the establishment of complete order in the provinces. I understand there have been some negotiations in Tehran for the exchange of some lorries for a certain number of rifles, but after proposals for the implementing of the scheme were made by the British authorities , the matter has not been pursued. The question of payment of the price of arms and ammunition purchased by the British Government some time ago is a further problem, the settlement of which, I understand, is not meeting with rnuch success. it is to be hoped that this item will also be cleared up soon. I was very glad that you kindly agreed to my suggestion that I may be kept informed of the course of current affairs between our two Governments as far as possible, while I would gladly on my part bring to your notice any information I may have. This would enable me to have the opportunity of dis cussing fully from time to time the outstanding matters with you or other officials of the Foreign Office concerned. This I feel may help to a better understanding of our mutual problems and may contribute towards the solution of some of the difficulties confronting us. I should very much appreciate it if you would kindly let me Know of the decisions reached in the matters mentioned above. KLease accept my renewed and sincere thanks for the ' sympathetic reception which you so kindly gave to my exposition of the view-points of the Iranian Governnent on the problems reiterated here, and to the suggestions made by m.

Price that cultivators can command depends on the state of the local market, but is invariably higher than the Government price, ana is likely to remain so unless conditions in Persia undergo a radical change. 2. Your paragraph 2. This is correct, but for successful enforcement of monopoly three conditions, none of which existed, were necessary: Security from invasion. Confidence in Food Administration, and x ^ , Adequate stocks to give new measures time to take eitect. The defence of Stalingrad and the arrival of American advisers somewhat improved prospects of establishment of UJ (2). and at one time (vide paragraph 6 of enclosure to my despatch No.286 to Foreign Office,^! to Minst ate; there was the possibility that the Russians might assist to provide (3; from azerbaiiair,'hut this hope proved illusory, and for continuance of experiment further imports are inevitable. For those I have now been compelled to ask, though I still.do not think that m the continued absence of (l) and (2) they will accomplish much. 5. Your paragraph 5. Having no reserves ? Government is forced to connive at,'if not actually to sanction, open market transactions. Many official permits to buy on open market are still outstanding, and in some provinces, n^ably Khuzistan, no attempt can be made to interfere with this until Governmen stocks are forthcoming. 4, Your paragraph 4. While it is true that lack of cereals available for transport is at the moment the chief problem, scarcity of lorries P in the hand of the Persian Government does in fact aggravate the situation by impeding rapid collection of such sticks as have been obtained, and foan for this work of Persian trucks hired by the U.K.C.C. would be of material assistance. Your paragraph 5.

As you are aware the Russians have demanded wheat, barley and rice from the north. They recently expressed indignation at the purchase of foodstuffs mainly vegetables in their zone by British Army contractors and at Ihe movement of rice south ward in U.K.C.C. lorries. Such movements were in fact on a small scale and were purely commercial transactions by private concerns. 2. Consequently the Russians imposed ban on movements of all foodstuffs including wheat and rice from the north until they had obtained satisfaction. Mr. Sher^Aw. has been engaged in continuous discussions with Russian Trade 4 Delegation and has agreed to provide their requirements, including reservation of all rice in Gilan for sale to the Russians. Mazanderan rice is to be available to the Persian Government. The Russians have therefore agreed to permit exports provided that they are covered in each case by v/ritten authorisation of the Ministry of^Food.

They agree generally x 'with your views but attach great importance to the food declaration being issued at a very early date since they regard this as the only means of arresting internal panic and strengthening Persian G-overmient T s hands, I understand they have given their Minister in Tehran discretion to support His Majesty's Minister in pressing for establishment of/new Persian currency commission with full powers over note issue but I believe that even if only a short term settlement of currency difficulties were the best that could be secured they will press for immediate food declaration, (see also my immediately following telegram). 2, I understand United States Minister is pressing for immediate provision of wheat to be increased to 25.000 tons. State Department are also enquiring whether it woula be possible ’ to made this wheat immediately available either from India or from Middle East Supply Centre pool replacing as soon as • possible from North iuierica. I suggest that even 11 part of the quantity involved could be so supplied by M.E.S.C. the remainder to be provided when the replacements were actually on the water this would be valuable not only in order to meet &lt; United States of America views but also m preserving principle of M.E.S.C. being sole supplier for the area.

I informed the Soviet Ambassador 11th November of progres of negotiations, and gave him a copy of the draft declaration in its present form. 2. In his interview with you, M. Maisky made several admissions, of which I made full use, about the causes of the present bread shortage in Tehran. Consequently my conversation with the Soviet Ambassador was rather more fruitful than usual. 3. My comments on the various causes are these (a) Smuggling of wheat out of Persia, Russians have discouraged this in recent months, but they have troops on Turkish border, whereas except for the Khanikin road, which smugglers would naturally avoid, we have no troops except at Sanandaj. On the other hand we will not,'as the Russians have always done, limit, still less forbid, Persian gendarmerie posts near the border. Moreover, we have always pressed the Persian Government to adopt the only effective measure of offering a higher price for wheat near the frontier so as to offset the attraction of Turkish and Iraqi markets. ihe mc«.in general increase in price fixed by the American adviser, though insufficient to compete near the border with prices on the other side, is said to be having some effect in other parts of Azerbaijan, while the attraction of a bonus for official buyers working in southern Khurdistan may bringout wheat which might otherwise have been snuggled into Iraq. I do not (CYPHER). WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION . FROM PERSIA . FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE. Sir R. Bullard. No. 1429. D. 9.30 p.m. 12th November, 1942. R. 7.50 a.m. 13th November, 1942. /thinkthink that there is much that our military authorities can do without hampering their military dispositions, t&gt;ut I will examine the question, (b) Shortage of lorries. I am glad to have this admission. Most of United Kingdom Commercial Corporation hired lorries are carrying Russian supplies, Russia (grp. undec. ? having) about 450. The Ambassador, hov/ever, declares that Russia will assist by providing lorries for the carriage of wheat to the railway in their zone. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation already do such jobs for the 'Persia n, Government, whenever they can. Road 'fransport/Ts doing it,s best. The American Minister and ^suggested to ^ * the Soviet Ambassador some time ago that he should appoint a representative on the Board, and the Ambassador now says that a member of the Soviet Railway Commission will probably be appointed. (c) Polish refugees. I reminded the Ambassador that we were evacuating Poles as fast as possible, and told him that most of the purchases for Polish refugees, mainly of local produce, are to be cut down. In any case, I said, the Poles never used local flour, but were supplied mainly from British sources or America. (a) British and Soviet forces. I asked whether our demands for local supplies could not be co-ordinated. After some pressing, the Ambassador agreed to instruct Commercial Representative to discuss this with British Army Purchasing Officer. This is important, but I am Tn^r sanguine about the result, as the Soviet Commercial Attache and Representative are very critical people. We ought to know what the Soviet demands are, and not only in foodstuffs. For instance, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Russia wants to buy horses, camels and donkeys while we are urging the Persian authorities to make use of all available animal transport. ^viy., fM. 3St(rw ft** fj- fnrrUTicjj* ^^ 0 / -U (3 I cAaavv . Second and last part . (e) Stoppage of wheat from the Russian zone. If 35,000 tons of wheat had been sent to Tehran we should , have stock for 4 months instead of 2 or 3 days. Promise to which you refer in your first paragraph may have arisen out of negotiations between Sheridan and the Soviet trade representative. Position is that whatever the surplus in Russian zone and whatever the promises given, the Russians are letting wheat out only in driblets and have agreed only after hard bargaining to allow 7,500 tons to be sent to Tehran during November i.e. less than one month*s consumption for the capital. I attributed this to the Russian resolve that the Persian Government shall sign proposed financial agreement, accept demands for sheep, horses, camels, etc., and squeeze food for Tehran out of southern provinces as far as possible. The Ambassador said quite rightly that little of supposed surplus in Azerbaijan had been collected as the landlords were unwilling to sell. This is the problem with which Sheridan has not dealt seriously yet, but on the other hand the Persians are discouraged from buying wheat there by the doubt whether the Russians will ever allow it to leave their zone. ihe Ambassador made a virtue or the agreement to supply railway /trucks! 130 2 trucks for 7,500 tons of wheat hut I reminded him that this would not provide a reserve. I said that surplus in Kermanshahr and Hamadan, if any, could not seriously benefit Tehran. Areas where surplus was known to exist were all in the Russian zone, and unless the Russians saw enough came to Tehran to last until British-American supplies began to arrive several months hence there might be a famine. Had Tehran been able to accumulate a reserve sufficient for even a few weeks the people would not now be in a panic, and the position of the Prime Minister, whom Soviet Government were so anxious to keep in power, would not be so dangerously weak. The Ambassador seemed to realise that the subject was too serious for usual debating points and I hope that my arguments will have some effect, particularly my fully justified contention that the weakness of the Prime Minister’s^position is largely due to panic about bread. Since our conversation I have learned that in their desperation the Persian Government were even thinking of bringing wheat from Meshed via Yezd lest the Russians should stop it at Shahrud if brought direct by railway. 4.

Can vou confirm Soviet Ambassador s statement to me that his Government had agreed that.35, COO tons of foodstuffs should be sent to Tehran from Azerbaijan.? Molouov s admission that there is a surplus of some 50,000 tons of wheat in North Peisia also provides a good argument for urging the Russians to let more wheat through to Tehran from the northern prpvmces. Even alter Russian military need.s have been met, a considerable amount should be left for Tehran. 2 You will have noticed that M. Maisky raised no objection to our'proposal to ship v/heat to Persia at^erpense of supplies to Russia. I. Molotov’s expression of surprise at our intention seems a mild enough reaction in the circumstances. 3. As for smuggling over the Iragi and Turkish frontiers, I shall be grateful if you will discuss with the military,authori ties possibility of tightening up control over the Irapi frontier. While this is primarily the responsibility of the Persian Government, it is obviously in eur interest that smuggling should be reduced, 4 Soviet Ambassador’s suggestion that his Government might wish to participate in the Declaration and also to be represented on the Road Transport Committee is of some importance and is perhaps encouraging as an evidence^of increased Russian willing ness to co-operate. But it is noo yet clear how ^ e + ^ 0 Y 1 ^ t ^ Government can undertake an obligation to supply wheat at a time when they are so short of this commodity that their local es hnve helned to provoke the present crisis.

Success of coercive measures against hoarders must always be doubtful, but in Persia in view of unreliable army, present lack of Government control in many areas and corruption and inefficiency throughout, attempts to pursue this policy, even if the Persian Government could be persuadedto adopt it whole-heartedly, would be bound to end in failure. Further objection is that the Russians have expressed themselves as opposed to coercion. In the circumstances it seems clear in order to * obtain and have large stocks which I am convinced still exist in the neighbourhood of Tehran* and other areas outside Russian control, Persian Government must appoint agents to purchase in open market at free price. Sheridan appears reluctant to agree and has already expressed the opinion following the general view of the t Persian Government, that the time has now come for Britain and America to assist with imported stocks. 2. If you agree with my above views may I assume that I shall have your general support in pressing for food adviser to modify his present attitude?

In addition laptain H^rington has been borrowed,temporarily, for worK in ajerbaijun, but recent developments make it improbable that the Hussians will now wish for our co-operation in this area. 2. Mr. aheridan, the ^ood adviser, has h-&gt;.d to concentrate all his attention in Musma., whinh on the food situation in Tehran which is the result of the refused of the Russians to allow any wheat for the capital to pass through their area is daily threatened with famine. Temporary permission was secured for the importation of wheat last week vvhich allow ed the accumulation of reserves for five daya, but this permission has now been rescinded and stocks will not lust for more than another da.y or two. Negotiations with the Russians are proceedings: and limited supplies ure in the meantime coming in from other are^s, chiefly *rak* S, k s was expected, the raising of the official price to cCX/O rials (in certain areas 3500rials) a ton has caused contusion and dislocation and has evoked strong arktlslscDOR protests from those areas which were functioning satisfactorily under the previous prices as well as much criticism from others. uncertainity as to the reasons for, and the objects of,this measure ha»* caused hoarders of stocks to hold buck, and no reports have yet been received that the Bank Melli have -taafr wajp- succeeded in effecting any considerable purchases at the new official price which is all that they are allowed to offer. The black market price has immediately risen and wheat in the neighbourhood of Tehran, which a fortnight ago could have been bought! privately at 4000 rials will not now be obtainable at less than 6000 rials, More serious still is the news that the prices of all other foodstuffs in the country have immediately been raised proportionately to that of wheat, Mr, Sheridan states that in certain areas purchases have indeed been facilitated, but this h^s not been reported from any area where Consular liaison Officers are at work, in kermanshah the combined efforts of the Consul, the rolitic-1 ,dviser and the Consular liaison Officer have been unsuccessful in effecting ^ny considerable collection of the landlords* wheat, even at the new price, -nd 4C landlords who as a result of strong pressure by His Majesty's donawl jugff.s-fcVttrr were arrested for hoarding, were released again the moment his back was turned without any deliveries of importance having been effected. The situation has been aggravated by the insistence of the military authorities that the pew low price at Which bread is sold in Kermanshah should not be raised, with the result that thousands of people are flocks into the town to obtain cheap bread r-ther than make use of their own c wheat which will fetch at least three times the price. In HamacUn lack of transport appears to be the chief obstacle in the way of collecting the fairly large supplies *hat are available in the villages, but the Ministry of tfood have succeeded in arranging a contract with the ahahsavond Tribe for the use of 5000 camels, which should help to ease the situation. The Government decision to increase the price of wheat has been severely criticised, and has immensely aggravated the situation in the town where largely increased crowds aim nm besiege the bakers shops. Here, as at Mermans hah, a greatly increased selling price for bread coupled with the immediate introduction of rationing system seems the only solution of the problem. In Arak /Av .

We have refused previous requests from the i ersian Government for wheat on the ground that there ought to be plenty of wheat in the country and that it is for them to collect, control and distribute the supplies available locally, )ut Soviet authorities 1 decision to purchase locally 5,000 tons of wheat, 15,000 tons of barley and 30,000 tons of rice, in addition to ... potatoes and other foodstuffs, has created a new situation. His Majesty 1 * Government recognise that it is convenient to supply doviet forces in Persia from local stores instead of importing supplies from the oaviet Union, But this will probably lead to serious shortage of cereals available for Persian population, 3, His Majesty*a Gawerwaent and United dtates Government are therefore considering issue of a Declaration whereby they would undertake to send supplies of cereals t© Persia to make up any real deficiency which may arise befere next harvest, MM a first step, we propose to send 20,000 tons @f wheat t® Persia t® replace the (IS 6371/LU/31) [Cypher] 1*) to aovxdf maoh ho. 321. 1st ilovember, 1912.

His Majesty 1 ® Minister at Tehran has been Informed by Persian Prime Linlster that his Soviet colleague has presented a draft Financial agreement to the Persian dovenment. Soviet iiH^assador had ncc inforiijcd Sir Iw liUllar . of his intention# But His Ja4esty f s Gevemment are glad that the soviet Government recognise paramount iaportance of tills question of local currency. So important is it for all the Allies and particularly for the maintenance of the sup ly mite to the Soviet Union that a refusal by the Persian Government to recognise their obligations in tills respect (which S‘i far as His Llajesty s Government are concerned are embodied in the Financial .agreement of last hay) must inevitably necessitate a recourse to forceful measures. 6.

In the case oi dollars, we understand that dollars are in fact freely convertible into gold if held by a foreign government. We should be ready to increase gold convertibility of sterling to 50 or 60 per cent or indeed, if necessary, to 100 per cent. Any currency commission that nay be set up wnl have to take oyer lithe assets, as well as the liabilities, oi the existing note l[issue. We had supposed that Persian Government would be unwilling hia A2. unwilling to hand over the assets, including gold and crown jewels, to an interallied commission, whichin general^we should of course prefer. But if, as seems most likely, Persian Government would not agree to this, establishment of a purely Persian body, independent of Majlis approval, ^to control currency would be an improvement on present situation. We assume you are satisfied that Banque MeHie could not carry out functions of such a commission. This solution would obviate the need for any transfer of assets. Terms pf reference of any currency commission should safeguard American supply of rials as well as our own. 4. We do not wish to have recourse to forcible measures and we should indeed lay ourselves open to reproach from Russian, and still more, American Government if we took such measures except in consequence of a definite stoppage in the supply of rials. But there is a limit to price which we are prepared to pay to ensure anything less than a fully guaranteed supply for the rest of the war. It is Imre that I aim prepared to leave you discretion in your handling of the question of the declaration if you will bear following principles in mind: (a) we intend to continue to do our best to ship the 20,000 tons of wheat to Persia whatever may happen. (b) we intend to of Financial ation and are secure the necessary Agreement irres prepared to ta end immediately supply is cut off, currency, and fulfilment Dective of any other consider- ;e forcible measures to this (c) in return for food declaration, even in its present form, it would be reasonable that the Persian Government should enter into an undertaking to ensure the supply ol currency for the duration of the war, or at least for a considerable period of time. But you may have discretion, subject to American concurrence, to let them have the present . declaration, even against a short-term guarantee of # rials, provided point (b) above is simultaneously made plain to .them in whatever form seems best to you. We should bo- ■ reluctant to see food declaration extended to cover whole period of tho war against anything less than e, similar or at least a long-term guarantee m regard to currency from the Persians. 5. We are hopeful that solution can be reached and crisis averted on these lines and we gather from your telegramho* — of 29th October] that you are inclined to share these hopes, ut should they be disappointed, I am urenared to leave Commander- arn prepared o such immedj in-Chief and you discretion .to-take &lt; may be necessary to maintain supply ox riais. such measures would be seizure^of Banque Mellie stocks of notes under such military dispositions necessary to this end. mmediate measures i Most obvious and of exis may be LS of ting s been informed of situation and rial question before 2nd November ivpcn 111 iT10RSUX*QS&lt;» 6.

But before we agree to send wheat to Tehran we should logically agree to take responsibility for meeting deficiency of/the south until next harvest. This is estimated by Persian Government at 15.000 tons in addition to monthly supply of 2,700 tons for which we have already taken responsibility (see paragraph 10 o f mv. tplegram No. 22 repeated Washington 1, Tehran 24, all saving). 11 we send wheat to Tehran with a view later in the year to Persian wheat flowing south through Tehran, railway bottleneck is being wastefully strained.

At the same time we must face the facts and the Majlis is quite capable of exploiting any situation in the future even to the extent of dishonouring Persia* s international undertakings. If therefore His Majesty s Government and the United States Government enter into any undertalcing to feed Persia I recommend strongly that there should be a coterminous undertaking from the Persian Government giving us and America all the rials we need. We already have this undertalcing in the financial agreement but the United States have nothing. 4. Moreover I wish to again emphasise the risks that we run in leaving with the Majlis the pov/er to hand us out at intervals small helpings of rials.I 1 '! ***'} ■ 5, ..In the food declaration we ore giving a most ^ valuable concession which we should not barter away for a paltry instalment of currency, 6, I again suggest therefore for your urgent consideration that the food declaration should be extended for the period of the war and that the lea'st quid pro' dub that we should accept should be the undertaking proposed in paragraphs 8(c) and 9 of my telegram No... 1575 which might take the form ox exchanges of identic Z ncues by the Persian Government with the British and United States C ^p / L * r r Legations simultaneously with the signature of the food declaration, I nave reason to believe that the principle of a currency commission might not be inac cep table* to the Persian Government, . 7, If the Mailis refused to authorise a settlement on the above lines then I think I must try to secure its immediate dissolution. With the food declaration to point to,, the proposed settlement has an air of reasonableness that could be used to show up the deputies for the gang of irresponsibles that they are, 8, I infer from your recent telegrams that we can hardly expect any active assistance from the Soviet Government in these negotiations. If that is so I cannot rely on much support from my Soviet colleague and it will fall to myself, with such support as I can get from my United States colleague, to find a solution.

(a) Persia is the only Middle East territory on whose food- supplies Russia is making inroads; and (b) in view of the terms of article No.7 of Tripartite Treaty, if Russia cannot feed her troops from Russia then her colleagues must either feed them or replace the food they take from Persian supplies since Persia has no surplus. 5.

States of America, United Kingdom, and J,S,S,R., (a_ Suressi g vital importance in the interests of the \var against Germany / that~2~ tliat adequate supplies of Persian currency should be made available.(b) pointing out that any failure on the part of i ersian Government to make currency available in return for sterling or dollars can only be construed as an unfriendly act ? (cj affirming that the Governments of the United Nations, being sensible of economic difficulties of Persia in the present world situation, are prepared to explore, without delay and in a spirit of friendly interest, all practicable meansof relieving them* We and the Soviets mighx make an additional appeal to the Treaty and we cur se Iv'es a further appeal to financial, agreement* An approach on those lines if made' with firmness and solidarity might keep the present Government in office -and to enable them to .extract a further stopgap bill from Parliament a 8. As regards long term policy, I propose that a new financial and economic agreement should be negotiated with the Persian Government* The parties should be the Governments of the United States, United Kingdom, and U.S.S.R. on the one hand and the Persian Government on the other. It should follow substantially the same lines as existing financial agreement but should contain the following addition al provisions: (a) Dollars as v/ell as sterling to be included. (b) Gold conversion ability to be extended to dollars and percentage increased to say 50$ or 60$. (c) Undertaking by Persian Government to introduce immediately legislation to remove from the Majlis the power to limit note issue and to establish a currency commission authorised to issue notes on conditions laid down by legislation. (d) Food, declaration in the form of some acceptable modification of draft declaration already submitted to you. (e) Some qualified guarantee about additional supplies other than cereals. (f) Agreement to operate for the duration of the war. 9o As regards (c), currency commission should prefer ably be international in composition. A purely Persian body could perhaps be accepted but only in the last resort. It.would be better than the present intolerable arrangements. 10* I am opposed, as I am sure you are, to any concession as regard.s rate of exchange. 11» These proposals if accepted would assure the con tinuation of an issue of Persian [repeat Persian] currency. If a further temporary respite is not found by November 2nd I see no alternative to forcible seizure of note forms in the National Bank, for the time is so short that there is no possibility of importing an alternative currency, and clearly r e cannot allow currency supply to break down. If we seize \ ( &gt; .

I would not .however, recommend the introduction of an Allied currency, either by use of Persian note-foms or otherwise, and b. fortiori the use of force in order to do so, except in the last resort, but the possibility that the situation can be met only in that way must be kept vividly # m mind.

One is compelled therefore to consider concessions. Financial concessions might take the form of amendment to Financial Agreement, conversion of a higher proportion of sterling balance into gold, conversion of a proportion of sterling balance into dollars, alteration of rate of exchange and so on. Material guarantees are probably more dangerous than financial concessions thoughif a material guarantee involved, as I suggest below, the establishment of a Food Board with a real strong personnel, this might be of great advantage to Persia as a whole. I assume in any case possibility of financial concessions has been fully explored and rejected. (Perhaps His Majesty’s Minister will confirm?) 3 That being so we must contemplate a material guarantee. But our objective should be the avoidance of a recurrence in a few months time of the present situation* It is intolerable that it should be. within the power of the Majlis to repudiate a IRE0». POL.DEPt.I financial/ H INDI CTI942 OFFICE t2. 9 . ' . financial agreement signed only last Hay, I feel therefore that we should aim at a Currency Commission on the lines of paragraph l of telegram No. 13h5. On the other hand if we delayed becoming committed to a food declaration in this period of the war we are very much in the hands of the Persian Government since such dangers as collections from cultivators of their seed wheat and undue recruitment of agricultural labour into the Persian iirmy would be difficult for the allied Governments to foresee in time or cope with. If it is impossible to obtain the establishment of a Currency Commission i'or- the -period of ’the ; war except against an equally permanent food declaration, I suggest that both should run in the first instance only till the next harvest and then become subject to a renewal clause so that we could abandon the food declaration at the price of the Currency Commission being dissolved. h. Fc.r the food declaration itself I would suggest the following modified version of the proposal transmitted in un, ’i ^ 7 ?• (a) Soviet Government to be associated with ,fl 3 !e.,United States and-British Governments in preamble. (b) A Food* Board to be constituted consisting of the Persian Soviet frog Bagdad Kuibvshev No. 7). £rr and jsm Minister of Food, a United States, a British representative. (See my telegram to .voji.JJo^ renent.ed to Tehran No, 281. Washingto n No. 23, (c) The Persian Government to undertake to carry out ail measures recommended by the Food Board which directly or indirectly affects the feeding of the people (including rationing bread, adulteration and measures to prevent qparding). (d) The Persian Government to undertake all such recommendations^of the Road Transport Committee, etc., as in t elegram No. 1332 . (e) If the Food Board after — consultation with Road Transport Committee, decide by majority vote that all practicable steps have been taken Uy the Persian Government to avoid a famine, under their engagements referred to in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) and that notwithstanding the steps so taken, famine can be averted only by provision of additional cereals by the governments of the United Nations, cereals in necessary quantities will be provided for sale by one or more of these governments, (f) Sufficient notice to be given to enable the internal movement of cereals to be planned and for cereals to be shipped if necessary by the governments of the United Nations in consultation pith Food Board and Road Transport Committee. spt 3 . I offer the following observations in relation to the foregoing as being an alternative version of the proposed agreement. (l) It seems to me essential that the. Russians should be closely associated with America and ourselves on this project. The wheat in question lies mainly in their zone and they know better than anybody else what is necessary to secure successful collection. They are in a position to facilitate collection and movement or the reverse and they control transport. It is their interest that is primarily at stake. ( 2 )/(2) If Allied Governments are to enter into-unlimited guarantee proposed, it is essential that they should enjoy at least as much control as is implied by the establishment of Food Board which I propose, (3) Such a board can serve both as day-to-day executive body and as court which decides whether guarantee must be implemented. This seems to me to be a great simplification, (A) Adulteration to be kept in the forefront. Use as an adulterant of rice (of which there are large supplies in Persia) must bo strenuously pushed by the Board, If we have to import cereals v/e may want a high proportion to consist of Iraq barley. The agreement must not exclude maximum practicable adulteration both with Persian and imported substitutes for wheat. (3) Under the agreement as drafted in telegram Mo. 1332 it S73i would^be easy for Persia to present us with one local deficiency after another thus multiplying any total deficiency and unnecessarily dislocating internal transport. Only if it can be established that transport difficulties are insuperable should we have to import who at for one locality when there is sufficient wheat elsewhere. And we should be given enough notice to enable us to supply transport, if we prefer to do so rather than wheat. (6) We must not become committed to the Allied Governments having themselves to undertake internal transport of imported cereals. 57/4 change in the * ‘ {jdcvr’ 6, Indication in telegram Mo. 1331 o f Russian attitude is very worrying! Els majesty’s Minister will no doubt be sending further particulars. I suggest urgent representations be made in Kuibyshev for [grp. unde. ? effective] co-operation and disclosure of intentions or of supply policy. Aid to Russia which is liable to suffer to the extent of two thirds of a ton for every ton of imported cereals sent to Tehran is the issue at stake and necessitates closest collabor ation in a spirit of candour by Russians in Tehran. (See paragraph 3 of my telegram referred to in paragraph A(b) above). 7. One must, I suppose face the possibility that Russian military position may become so perilous that aid to Russia would be a consideration over-riding even the avoidance of famine in Persia. I imagine you will consider whether agreement should contain some kind of escape clause referring say to overwhelming military necessity or whether we should face that issue only if and when it arises. 8. I am repeating this telegram to Washington and I imagine you will repeat to Washington telegrams under reference and other related telegrams. 9. Tehran telegram to y ou Mo. has just arrived.

Bullard {Tehran). (No. 231.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 23, 1942. THE Persian Minister came to see me this morning to discuss his Government’s economic difficulties, and in particular their need for wheat. Mr. Taqizadeh maintained that the Persian Government had done everything within their power to check hoarding. They had agreed to offer a greatly increased price for wheat and had also set up a Ministry of Food. Nevertheless, they had been unable to secure any appreciable quantity of wheat, and the public now feared that there would be a serious shortage during the coming year. 2. In order to allay these anxieties, the Persian .Government wished to establish a reserve of wheat in Tehran, which could be drawn upon in an emergency. They had therefore suggested that His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government should make a joint Declaration, in which they would promise in certain circumstances to make up any deficiency in cereals which might arise in Persia. The Minister understood that you and your United States colleague had agreed to the text of this Declaration, except for the last clause, which provided that a reserve of 25,000 tons of wheat should be established in Tehran. 3. I told Mr. Taqizadeh that I really could not believe that Persia needed wheat at the present moment. The country was normally self-supporting in cereals and the harvest was only just over, there must be any amount of wheat in the country, and it was up to the Persian Government to make a really serious effort to secure this wheat. Mr. Taqizadeh explained that his Government were extremely anxious to establish a reserve at Tehran. I said that, before we could decide whether it was necessary to ship any wheat to Persia, we should have to have more information about the stocks now available in the country. I under stood that Mr. Sheridan, the American Food Adviser, was investigating this question; if he found that it would be necessary to import some wheat into Persia before the next harvest, we should have to consider what we could do to help. But the Minister must realise that, in any case, it would be at least three months before any wheat could reach Persia from North America. For the immediate future, it was therefore up to the Persians to help themselves. Even if it should prove necessary to ship wheat to Persia, the Minister would realise that this entailed diverting ships from elsewhere and thus indirectly prolonging the war. We could not undertake to do this, unless it was absolutely essential. 4. Mr. Taqizadeh then turned to the question of our request for further supplies of rials. He explained that the note issue had already been greatly increased during the last year and his Government feared that any further increase would lead to inflation. I reminded the Minister that in the Financial Agreement his Government had undertaken to make available sufficient rials to meet our needs. As an instance of the way in which we had fulfilled our obliga tions under the agreement, I mentioned that we had only recently provided gold to the value of £2 million. It was now up to the Persian Government to do their part by providing the rials we needed. I did not consider that the Persian Government were entitled to link up the question of supplying rials with the entirely separate matter of wheat supplies. But I undertook to consider what could be done to help the Persian Government over wheat, if our information showed that imports would really be necessary. 5. Mr. Taqizadeh also mentioned his Government’s need for lorries. I explained that we fully sympathised with the Persian Government’s difficulty in this respect; unfortunately, we ourselves were also extremely short of lorries, but I would see what we could do to help. Finally, the Minister gave me an aide- memoire covering the points which he had discussed with me. I am. &amp;c. ANTHONY EDEN. [34—58],.4^'C/ /42 24tli Octobiii’, 4^42. No. 1324.

Bread situation could only be solved by complete co-operation between the Allies. Could not the Russians help to send to Tehran some 13,000 tons of wheat now on or near the railv/ay at two places in Russian zone: it would suffice for six weeks and give the Allies time to breathe. 2. In reply to my enquiry the Soviet Ambassador stated that he v/ould not require any more grain. If the present Soviet requirements were met the Soviet authorities would co-operate in the despatch of wheaot to Tehran even supplementing the railway by military lorries. 3. The conversation was friendly but the Ambassador was entirely non-committal as to how to deal with the pressing problems of currency, Majlis and Cabinet. This seemed to me rather ominous, combined as it was with the statement that the Soviet authorities proposed to pay for the grain not in rials but in goods. If they have any goods, which is doubtful, these should go to wipe off the Balance of nearly 50 million rials due on the ambassador's / shewing2. . , ob t^.nod from the Persian Government, showing m respcct/.t realising how intensely un- I greatly fear Soviet Government, re^i-oing QSG to 1?aV e popular the extension of the note issue i ^ p 1Ilst a l/to meet that crisis alone while they^oica^i^ to e promise of goods which they o ,: '? umonular by their Russians have suddenly be °S e pi 1 o and report that farp. undec. ? detention ofj wheat in xneir ^ ed t ^ at we lley are buying Persian grain, Jin ^ p f n solving the financial should do better not to seek their h neip the beUcr policy is problem, but I .hink -he - ^ dissolution^ of the complete c?-^eration, especia^iy a without Russian nelp, Mailis, which could n^t bo accempiieuo is one of our desiderata,, iRepeated to Kuibyshev as Foreign Oifice telegram - Wo. 1436. , n Ccpies sent to Mr* ^rmswrongJfi w /r— Copy.-“ L.’W-o (B 6227/144/34) ^ 5b0l ■Uiki e ' ! / i 24 OCT IQiO ^/'t'hie telegram Is of particular secrecy^and should he ^ 7T /2ce^ -V 24 retained hy the/authoris^ed recipient and not passed on_7. * !

He seems (grp. undec. ?prepared to) admit that the Allies cannot afford to have their plans delayed and perhaps blocked entirely by Parliament, whose hostility to the Allies is now clear, and he realises that unless we find some radical solution by about November 3rd we shall hive no money, and we may have no Persian Government through whom work.

The Prime Minister attempted to/secure from me an. under taking to recommend tc His Maiesty's Government their acceptance of the proposed food declaration for the -period of the war in return for his undertalcing to push a note'issue Diii^ior 2.000..; . million rials through Parliament c . I 'refused^ ;pointing out that the Persian Government already had. an obligation under the Financial Agreement to supply us with unlimited rials and that now he. was asking us for h long term guarantee about food while giving us only a short term guarantee for rials, ■ In order to meet an immediate critical situation and to^ enable the Government to introduce an emergency bill to-day providing a fortnights supply of rials, my American colleague and myself undertooic to forward for consideration of our respective Governments the text of a food declaration, limited m it's duration, however, until next harvest. , v , ; 2. The proposed declaration would bind us in_ certain circumstances guarantee the bread supply of Persia up to the next harvest, say June 1945. In return for_ this under talcing our highest expectation is to- obtain the aj ? o 00 million, note-issue bill from the Government/which, taking, in/p consideration the needs of the Russians, (say 100_million a. ■, month) and of the Persian Government itseli, would suffice ±or our currency needs for from 4 to 5 months, as we should get probably only half of the '2,000. millions.3* At the end of that- time an occasion for further blackmail would arise and I am sure the Persian Government would not hesitate to avail itself of it,, We could of course again appeal to the Financial Agreement and informthe Persian Government that the consequences of their repudiation of that Agreement would he our repudiation of the food declaration* But that would not get us rials. Moreover, the American Govern ment, while a party to the food declaration are not a party to the Financial Agreement, and so would be on less firm ground® A, I suggest that it is therefore for consideration whether our long term policy shall be to extend the food declaration for the period of the war (either now or after the 2,000 million bill has been put through) in return for a bill passed through the Majlis containing provisions on the following lines; (a) The Persian note-issue to be placed in the hands oi a Currency Commission composed as suggested in paragraph 6 of my telegram No, 1330,WA^'(b) Limitation on amount of note-issue to be removed (c) issue of further currency to be x^estricted to issues against acquisitions by the Currency Commission of sterling, dollars or other recognised foreign exchange at the present rates of exchange. This would prevent the Persian Government continuing its present policy of avoiding the imposition of additional taxation by the inflationary expediency of long-term borrov/ing from the National Bank. 5. I am convinced that so long as the power to limit the note-issue remains with the Majlis we shall have these recurring crises, and that a degree of allied control oi Persian ciureiicy is a necessary consequence of our military occupation of the country not only in the interests of the Allies but also of the country itself. We might secure this desideratum by giving the food guarantee for the period of the war, or some other equivalent economic concession. Without something of the kina, I see no prospect* of obviating the resignation of the Government in a i or .y~ night at the latest, and a currency deadlock that we shall only be able to terminate by the use of force. 6, This telegram with the exception of the last few words about the use of force, was read to my American colleague by the Financial Counsellor. The American Minister expressed his agree ment with this appreciation of the situation, but stated that he was unwilling on account of his lack of financial experience to commit himself to an opinion that (c) as in paragraph lour offered the best solution.

Following is personal message for Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Minister of State. During visit to Tehran I was much impressed by the difficulties of the food situation in Persia which are aggravated by British and Russian purchases of foodstuffs on military account and in Tehran by purchases for Polish refugee Persian civil needs in respect.or foodstuffs are working on very narrow margin. Unco-ordinated purchases gnay well under mine Persian economy and necessitate imports of wheat or other foodstuffs from overseas. This can pnly be at the expense of supplies to Russia both as regards shipping and as regards rail and road transport through Persia. It is therefore neither in Russia’s interest nor our own. 2. To meet this situation I suggest the formation of a central body to co-ordinate Allied purchases of foodstuffs in Persia with Persian civil requirements. It should comprise British, Russian, American and Persian representatives. An essential requirement is that the Russian representative should have wide discretion and powers. No Russian in Persia now possesses these and consequently [grp. undec. ?corporate] efforts to set up and operate such a body would be futile. 3. I would suggest that M. Stalin # be approached in what ever manner seems best and urged to nominate^suitable representative to co-operate with us, emphasising that failure to protect Persian economy is bound to harm Russian interests most. 4. I havo discussed with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and with General Wilson who both agree with the aDove. [Repeated to Washington. No. 6359, Kuibyshev No. 1416 and Tehran No. 1408].

Qpestion^ of ^ food situation in Persia has changed completeTi owing to conviction to which I and my advisers have^ come that the Russians propose to live on the country to a greater extent than hitherto, unfortunately evidence was obtained just too late to be submitted to the Minister of State/before his departure. There is indisputable evidence that Russian military officers have been preventing despatch of wheat to /che capital from areas which they occupy and which alone have a considerable surplus. The Russian Ambassador has suddenly changed his views as to the wheat surplus in Azerbaijan and Khorassan declaring for instance that Khorassan crop which is generally admitted to be unprecedentedly good is no better than last year's. /According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Russians have/demanded 11,000 tons of potatoes for immediate delivery and this is out of proportion to their current needs. Conclusive evidence is however provided by a statement made by General Mel [10 grps.omitted] asks the British to bring in food for his troops as it might be impossible to feed them from the Caucasus. If such requests were received and need seemed sufficiently urgent economical course would be for the Russian troops to live on local wheat and barley and for quantities used to be replaced by us or by America. I am inclined to think that this process is already beginning and that there is no other explanation of Soviet Ambassador's estimated Soviet requirements in currency viz. rials 100/000 per mensem seeing that the Soviet authorities spend no rials on works or on pay for troops. Once purchased there would be nothing to prevent export of part of foodstuff to Russia* 2. In conversation with the Soviet Ambassador to-day I quoted General Mel.s words. I said that our main business was to assist Russia and that if that required that Russian troops 'Should purchase Persian wheat we should have to see what could be done; only it might help to create a shortage which Persia would look to the Allies to make good. We Allies were responsible through our purchases and our enormous currency expenditure for the greater part of the distressing rise in prices and if in addition bread continued to be short we should nave [2 grps.omitted] in the matter. We #ust pool our information and our efforts for the general good. &lt; '. r / V- 1 » A / V‘~A / ocu*. s ) • /A--7E-cct tJI then explained that^the declaration which foms the subject of my immediately following telegram adds any shipping and railway wagons used to transport wheat for the Persian people would reduce supplies for Russia or for Allied forces in Persia. The Ambassador did not contradict General Mel.^.’s statement and he made none of the usual asseverations about Russian help for Persia. As to the proposed declaration he took note of it and said that he would report to his Government, _ ^I asked whether he thought that the Soviet Government should join in some such declaration but he could give no opinion. ^ first sight the obligations which the proposed declaration appears to place on His Majesty’s Government will seem unreaspnable. Regarded cynically it involves little obligation since it is certain that the Persian Government will fail to do their best to remedy the food crisis. Regarded humanely it involves no more than obligation to supply wheat if local supplies fall short owing either to Russian purchases or refusal to release for local markets and/or consumption by British, Russians, Americans and Poles or supplies e.g. potatoes which would have eked out the bread shortage. Regarded politically it is the only concession I can find to ease the passage of the Currency Bill, • i 4’ The American Minister concurs in the draft declaration and is telegraphing it to hr.s Government with whose views he believes it to be m accordance. Soviet Ambassador had considered the proposed declaration he said that he had something important to sa^ and he delivered what was^obvipusly prepared speech'to the effect that the position of^the Prime Minister was insecure that frequent changes of Government aid us great harm and that we must do everything we'could to keep the Prime Minister^in power. I said that I entirely agreed ana thayit was with that in view that my American colleague ana I had deciaea to forward^the draft declaration to cur Governments: coula he suggest anything more or anything better that we coul r ' do? He could not. 6. Russian economic methods in Persia have been tortuous and sometimes.dishonest but it is the future that matters. Without the co-operation of all the four powers concerned there may be famine here which would wreck our policy of aid to Russia,. The Russians will have to work with us and to reveal their needs. We on the other hand must be prepared to acknowledge that we are exporting potatoes to our troops in Iraq without having been able to obtain export permit from the Persian Government and that we buy local produce other than wheat without thinking of the effect on prices and consequently the pockets and attitude of the Persians. 7. It is only fair to add that in spite of our utmost endeavours the Persian Government have not yet taken adequate measures to increase their own production of cereals, to get out or hoard the quantities necessary to feed towns or to rationalise and control motor transport. We have some grounds for optimism in each case but fear of famine ?s a valuable incentive to impose the necessary but unpopular measures and it is most important that we should do nothing to'remove that /incentive* 5. incentive. I think however that undertakings to he given by the Persian Government as recorded in draft declaration and the growing [?grp.omitted] American Food Adviser and of Road Transport Committee are a sufficient protection against this. Even while this telegram has been in preparation the American Food Adviser has persuaded the Russians to allow some wheat down from their areas and has found close to Tehran four hoards of wheat totalling 800 tons which the Persian authorities alone would probably never have brought into the market.

Sin 2.

It was only with great reluctance and 6 j \eJZr*v&gt;f&gt; 1* tvvtvu^*^ jVUCi' 4 Moo ^ juxT after considerable pressure through this Legation that they agreed, three months too late to be of any uae, to raise last year's prices by bO; * kr. Sheridan has had the somewhat doubtful advantage of having to deal with a new Ministry of Food, untrammeled by either experience or prejudice, and does not appear to have consulted local expert opinion before arriving at his decisions. It now remains to be seen whether his appeal to the patriotism of the landowners and other speculators will cause them to abanaon their attitude of centuries and forego their chances of still further profits in order to serve the interests of their country. 3. I have given instructions to all Consulates to assist in the carrying out of the new measures as far as they are able to do so and it stands to reason that in the main surplus areas of Eastern Azerbaijan and Khoraesan their task will be immensely facilitated* The first immediate result which directly affects our own interests is that a scheme for the purchase of one thousand tons of wheat in the open market at prices ranging from 2600 to 3200 rials, for labourers employed by us on road and defence works, will inevitably fall to the ground. But the most difficult areas, where the problems to be faced are most aoute and most urgent, are those along the western frontier, with the addition of Isfahan, long notorious for the cupidity of its inhabitants. In these areas the fixing of the Government price at 3600 can have little effect, and the problem which previous Governments have been trying to solve by purchase at the price obtaining in the open marxet would appear to remain further than ever from solution. 4. Particularly generous is the fixing of the price for next year’s harvest at 2600 rials per ton, and it will be interesting to see if the new Food Administration inspires sufficient confidence to induce landowners to sow all* the seed wheat/ The kight Honourable Anthony Eden, P.C., M.C*, M.P., etc*, etc*, etc*. Foreign Office. fa m tor. / Uo.C’O. co. o.mMA fUkAr COHy^K.vNGK - Monday&gt; October 5th , 1* The moat important question for discussion ie whether we should now plan to send further supplies to Iran so as to arrive in either January or March when pessimists anticipate famine. Points to be considered in this connection are: (1) Is there enough wheat in the country or not? If the answer ie in the negative, obviously we must ao something about it. (2) If answer is in the affirmative, then are we to arrange to bring in wheat as a precaution ao as to avoid clanger of cessation of work on our L • of o# with possible riots and blocking of our supplies to Russia (such action will, of course, reauce the volume of supplies for Russia pro tantp ), or are we to risjc riots and leave tne country tostarve and so leave more shipping available for supplies to Russia? II* Mr. KAHN is also interested in the question of administration of the wheat problem and has proposed that the Persian Government should introduce radical changes in their policy* It might be useful to „r. JriSRIGAN to have the views of the officers present on the following points inter alia; (1) dhould the Persian Government change their official buying price from proprietors and endeavour to establish a single price for proprietor, peasant and merchant? (2) Would it be a good thing for this price to be fixed at slightly below the present open market price in each district and to be clearly announced with the statement that it will be reduced periodically, say by 80 £ every six weeks?co^y . r EXT /) r^xtmcte Supplies from the iilnutes of a Conference on Vfoeat held on Monday, October the 6th, nt the British Legation, Tehran. The question of surplus or deficit of wheat supplies in the various areas was discussed and the following conclusions reached. 2. Azerbaijan. The maximum surplus available is 20,000 tone and possibly 10,000 tons from the Kurds if a sufficiently hi$i price is offered and there is sufficient transport. 5. Hamadan. The surplus from Ham ad an area including Burujird, should be 10,000 tons and probably another 10,000 tons from Kermanshah and Kurdistan. 4. Sultanabad. About 3,000 tons are available from the undertakings and possibly another ?,000 tons, making 5,000 tons in all. 5. Khuzistan. There is now a serious shortage as Government has failed to collect any appreciable quantity. Small quantities are available at fantastic prices. 6. Tehran. only 260 tons of wheat and 150 tone of flour, less than two days supply, is in stock. The requirements of Tehran for theremaining ten months are reckoned at 760,000 tons, but this is at 260 tons a day and some may be supplied from the Tehran area reducing the demand to 66,000 tons. 7. Isfahan. There should be a surplus sufficient for the requirements of the town, butowing to difficulties in collection and to the removal of some wheat by the Bakhtiari, who are claiming ownership over some of the villages they previously owned, there will probably be a deficit, enough being collected to supply the town for only six to nine months. There has, however, been a very good riCe harvest, and about 10,000 tons of rice should be obtained, and if this is used with wheat Isfahan should be able to supply itself. 8. Shiraz. About 6,000 to 7,000 tons are available, and there will probably be a deficit of 6,00 tons.' It is however possible that this might be made up by the use of maize and millet of which there have been good crops. 9. Bush!re. About 4,500 tons are required for Bushire and the adjacent Oulf areas. 10. Kerman. There is a shortage but it should be possible to make this up from ^abul. 11. Meshed. There have been record crops and it is estimated that 80,000 tons can be obtained of which there will be a surplus of 40,000 tons for elsewhere* It will probably not be possible to get as much as 40,000 tone out, but at least 20,000 tons should be available for Tehran. /12. Mr.12. Mr. Sheridan stated that the requirements of deficit areas based on the latest Government reports are: ihwaz -£j5,CCC tons; South Persia Coastal Belt - 2 P QGC tons; 3andair?b8B - 1,000 tons; Kerman - 4,000 tons. It is reckoneWthat 16,000 tons sill be required altogether. 16. The question of adulteration was discussed, but it was decided that owing to transport and other difficulties this could only be done in places where other crops are obtainable in sufficient quantities, such as rice in Isfahan and harricot beans in Kermanshah and Hamadan, where there are said to be large quantities available. Adulteration with barley on a large scale is not feasible as this is required for horses. There is also the possibility of an exchange of 60,000 tons of rice for 50,000 tons of wheat from Russia, and even if this is not effected the 60,000 tons of rice can be used for adulteration with flour, thus reducing the requirements of wheat. The desirability of the maximum adulteration possible was accepted. 14. It was decided that the answer to the question in para 1(1) of the Agenda was that there is enough wheat in the country provided that there is sufficient control by rationing or otherwise, and use is uade of adulteration where possible. The main difficulty is transport, but this is being organised, so that only lorries certified as carrying essential loads for Government, the U.K.C.C. or the Russian Government will be allowed on the roads, all others being confiscated and use being made where possible of lorries returning empty to carry commercial loads at ordinary rates. 16. As regards the question in para 1(2) of the Agenda, Mr. Sheridan asked that a reserve should be kept to be supplied from Basra in case of necessity on the basis of a loan to be returned by the Persian Government when wheat from the north was obtained, but this should not be made known to the Persian Government as it might cause a relaxation of the efforts to obtain the wheat which is in the country. 16. The general view on the questions raised in para II of the Agenda was that the Persian Government should offer a higher price for purchases from both proprietors and peasants, and that the high price fixed should not be final but should be reduced later on, to avoid any appearance of prices being pushed. Mr. Kahn considered that there should be a clean sweep of the present system of purchasing and all wheat should be purchased by Government in the same way at the same price, but the general opinion was that it was impossible to do away with the system of undertakings which has been infbrce for many years and under which s certain quantity of wheat has already been collected. As regards prices it was suggested by Mr. Sheridan that as an experiment prices should be higher at the centre of an area and less according to local conditions at places outside, in order to encourage owners to transport their wheat to the centre for sale. Mr. Squire suggested that all wheat purchases, except the landlords 1 surplus to be delivered under their undertakings, which should continue to be collected by the Persian Government in the usual way, should be made by a single organisation financed by the Bank Melli with a reliable non-official in charge, purchases being madenot at a fixed price but at as hi^i a price aa necessary in the particular area, this price to be reduced when supplies are coming in. This suggestion was discussed and it was felt that the purchasing should be in the hands of a Committee in each area, including a representative of the Bank Melli and of the Imperial Bank, all being controlled by a central Committee in Tehran, which would, on information received, give instructions as to the reductions in prices. This organisation would purchase for road Isbour, etc., as well as for the supplies of deficit areas, and competition would be done away with. 17. On Mr. Kidd's enquiry as to whether there would be a subsidy to keep down the price of bread, Mr. Sheridan explained that the Persian Government already bore the loss in Tehran, where the official price of bread was 1 rial per kilogramme, but this is not done in the rest of the country where the price of bread is much higher; and that it has been proposed that Government should bear the loss in the rest of the country also, the price of bread being possibly raised in Tehran but kept low elsewhere.Mmmmammmmmamm r 5?, j .

Most unfortunately, Mr. Sheridan, new American food adviser stated in an interview October 14th 'before I left my country I was convinced that Allied Governments v/ould not^ let Persia suffer from lack of food'. This statement which S made without consulting either me or my .American colleague naturally raised hopes in the Persian Government and when the Minister of State in an interview of October 16th told the Prime Minister that shipping and internal transport position v/ould not allow promise to be given to make up wheat deficit (which however he did not think should occur) the Prime Minister was the more disappointed. The Prime Minister sent word afterwards that in the circumstances he did not see how he could proceed with the Currency Bill._ This is excellent means of blackmail since we must have rials immediately. So far it has not been possible to find formula that would be acceptable to both sides. 2. Bread situation in Tehran is very bad and although is is the fault of the Government it is awkward for us. The press say nothing about hoarding but demand 100,000 tons of wheat from the Allies and they have adopted very hostile attitude about the Currency Bill* 5.

It is impossible to forsee the result of this experiment which is obviously hastv and insufficiently considered improvisation to meet the present emergency^and will cost an extra 600 million rials. In Eastern Persia, where the present price of 1500 is accepted as generally reasonable and black market rate is approximately 2500, the price offered seems unnecessarily High but much of the wheat should be forthcoming and more may be attracted from Afghanistan. The same should apply to the belt between Tabriz and Sultanabad. All advice to raise the official prices has been firmly resisted by the previous Gpvemment on the ground that the only effect would be to raise the black market rates with little corresponding^benefit and it hardly seems that even the new price is high enough to attract speculators in Tehran,Isfahan and Khuzistan even though anti-hoarding law be vigorously applied, and the situation in these areas will almost certainly become worse. Turkey will presumably immediately raise f the price to continue to attract wheat across the western Azerbaijan border and Iraq, may be compelled to follow suit to protect her own interests. Fortunately Eastern mzerbaiianand Khorassan arc the two main producing centres and viewed as a whole the measure should succeed in producing more wheat. 2. The intention is also to reduce the price offered by 20$ after 6 weeks, to arrange adulteration and rationing as soon as possible, to maintain the price of bread at low level and to fix the new minimum price of 2800 rials for next year s harvest, which should be mpre than sufficient to induce ample sowings if the offer is believed.

He appreciated the work of C,L.0,S. and hoped the scheme would continue but admitted he should have been here three months earlier and expressed great anxiety regarding the situation in Tehran which has official supplies for two days only and Khuzistan which has none.

With a new and unreliable Minister of Food and no assistant combining honesty with experience, Sheridan is faced with a situation of extreme difficulty. Unfortunately he considers he can operate satisfactorily with only Persian assistants educated abroad or in American colleges. . It is hardly to be expected that he can as yet realise that the provinces take no notice of Central Government and that passive resistance will go far to frustrate his best endeavour. .

Mr. Healy has arx'ived and has gone to Kermanshah with a view to relieving Captains Kyle and Kazi who will shortly have to return to military duty. ope shortly to get a Russian speaking officer for Azerbaijan, and Col. Schomberg is expected shortly. 2* Much has depended on local conditions and on the personality of the officers working as O.X.Os. In Shiraz, Kerman and Sultanabad it looks as if a very large measure of success will attend the efforts of our ColuOs., and a fair proportion of the landlords * ‘ share of the surplus seems likely to be collected. The two former districts are deficit areas and should be able to manage with only a small amount of assistance from outside, while Sultanabad should have a very considerable surplus for export. Ramadan and Kermanshah, the two principal wheat producing areas, have not done so well. Ramadan v/ill produce enough for its own needs, but, so far as present indications go, little more.; while Kermanshah, from which area the the chief smuggling to Iraq has taken place, is still only able to feed its principal towns.with the greatest difficulty and conditions are still acute. Only in Isfahan does our scheme appear to have made no progress whatever. As regards areas where we have no 0.1.0s, .the Russians in Azerbaijan seem still ready to help and have offered that one of their /ice Consuls should tour the areaswith a 0.1.0. when we can send one. Immediate action in this area is very necessary to prevent the new harvest following its predecessor across the western frontier. In Khorassan the prospects are excellent but the Governor-General does not wish to be rushed into collecting any large part of the surplus for the capital at present. Khuzistan has been a great disappointment. So much delay has taken place in arriving at any Government policy that most of the available wheat appears to have passed into the hands of speculators v/ho are holding out for famine prices and are still reluctant to sell though the price has reached between £70 and 80 a ton. This is largely due to fear that if they do so Government will at long last take action against them under the Anti-Hoarding lavK All that the A.1.0.0. have so far succeeded in buying is some 200 tons in small quantities at prices ranging from £30 to 50 a ton. 4. Tehran continues its hand-to-mouth existeno^relying chiefly on the last of the imported wheat now finding its way up from the south. This will come to an end in about ten days, by which time another crisis may be expected. Meanwhile reports continue to be received of large stocks in the immediate vicinity on which corrupt officials still make little attempt to lay their hands. Unfortunately, in deference to the wishes of Monsieur Bader the previous Minister of Finance, who was confident that his Department would adequately control the \ ftorne area, we have no C.I..0. in this neighbourhood. 5. Progress has been further handicapped by the dismissal of Monsieur Ardalan, the Director-General of the newly constituted Food Department, who, though he had shown himself friendly and helpful, was somewhat inefficient and unable to deal with the critical situation confronting him. His post has been raised to that of Minister of Food, to which Monsieur Farrukh has been appointed, an unfortunate choice, as he is an excitable, impulsive and obstinate creature, with a quite undeserved reputation fnr energy % who recentl T has proved a complete failure as GovemoiN*Ger»al of Kerman and subsequently, during the few v/eeks in which he held office under the Soheily Government as Minister of the Interior. He has professed himself /as willing to help in every way, but it is almost impossible to do business with him as Mr. Sherjfidan, the new American Adviser who has just arrived, will doubtless discover. -s already reported, the landlords have been ordered ^'•omplete their undertakings to deliver wheat by the end of the Sn^nrivar (September 2£nd) and surprisingly enough it appears that in some, though not in many, districts this will in fact have been done; but the Government scheme for setting up another organisation to buy any further v/heat which was especially badly needed on the western frontiers has not so far materialised. The agricultural Bank were first ordered to start in Azerbaijan, Kurdistan and Kermanshah, but professed itself unable to do so. The task was then entrusted to the Katiohal Bank, who did nothing, and now with a new Minister and an even newer American Adviser further delay is inevitable but it is hoped that it will not bes: too long. Permission to buy 1,000 tons of v/heat in Kurdistan for our road labour, for which;. : wq have had to ask for the Chief Engineer, and the entrusting of this work to Dr. Muavin, a prominent landowner of the Kermanshah district, may however have some effect in stopping the smuggling into Iraq from this area. I v/as unfortunately unable to get Monsieur J’arrukh to adopt my suggestion that this permission should be extended to cover the frontier regions of Kermanshah also. • '[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty f s Government^ and shotUdfWk^ under Lock and Key.] E X % % '^PHER], ;CRET POLITICAL DISTRIBUTION. / From PERSIA .

In order to achieve the object in view £fie Department-General of &lt;lereals prepares in the month of I hordad every year (23 hay - 21 fune ; before the harvest is lifted a forecast of the wheat crop; this forecast is prepared in accordance with the information which is collected from the provinces about the condition of the crops j end a progreswe for the transport of wheat from surplus to deficiency areas is then drawn up on the basis of this forecast. has pointed out in your letter, net bad on the whole, but in most of the wheat-producing areas in Which the lifting of the harvest begins in the month of Thahrivar (22 ug - 21 Sept) the crops on the threshing floors were seriously damaged owing to the even to of Gmhrivnr, ant a great part of them disappeared; subsecfuently Govemsient officials were unable despite of strenuous efforts to move even the quantity which it was possible to collect owing to lack of transport; thus a part of the difficulties of supplying 'Tehran, Isfahan and other towns with bread last year and at the beginning of this year arose out of the events of Ehahrivar. Government to provide assistance from abroad to make up the deficit to the extent of at least 150,000 tons of wheat, but unfortunately they were not successful in del tv ring -fore $han 80,000 tons, including the quantity delivered by theddusolane, owing to shipping difficulties. s has been repeatedly ex l ined to l;r.3quire, one of the essential conditions of success in collecting wheat and preventing hoarding Is to have a sufficient quantity of wheat in the Government depots niid this gas the Government’s object in insisting on the provision of “sufficient quantity of wheat last pear. r hit unfortunatiy the bread situation The practice of the Government in the wheat ;uestion last year the country’s output was, as Tour xerllency \t that time the Iranian Government requested 8~ 2 - In Tehran, as low Axcelloney will have observed, ahows with what difficulties we are faced even now at the begljsning of the harvest and the diffIcultlpWi of the situation is Itaelf a powerful factor causing anxiety in the population and enoouraging hoarders and opens the road to every sort of abuse; whereas if the ilovcrnnicnt had a reserve of not loss than 20,000 tons in its Tehran depot it would be able, without causing an uncalled for Wise in the; priee of wheat, tc collect easily nil the surpluses and tc pr coed with the utmost severity against hoarders. 2. In your letter Your Excellency referred to the halancw of Inst year ? a crop and assessed the surplus for Yhorassan at 40.000 tons, but you will recollect that similar argixasnts pere adduced frora the Britisd'i Consular officials at Isfahan and E nuadan and that finally, In order to establish the facts of the case and to make it clear that'the Oovamment had raade the neeeesary efforts to collect surpluses, penaiaeion was given to Colonel French to buy such quantities as he could in Hsraadan and I?jfiphan through his ovm officials acting with the official approval of the Iranian government} if you will ask hr.fquire you will find that the quantities purchased by these officials were negligible compared to the figures estimated by the British Tonealar officers; so tmaoh so that Mr. -quire, himself agreed that these estimates were baseless. Your ixeellency may therefore ' rest assured that the figure of 40,000 tons for the surr^lws over consumption needs in rhorassan is based on no foundation. ' our :x clleney will naturally b© aware that at least 10.000 tons of Azerbaijan wheat used to be allotted every year for the consumption of Tehran, whereas l*st gear, oving to the lack f security in that region and to the opening of the Iranian fronti r on the Turkish and Iraqi sectors, the bread supply of Tabriz watt assured only with the greatest difficulty and the situation in tsssuaswihLisuiww*sw»fr that city is still very difficfult. I mm sure that Your xcellency will agree that the Iranian ovemment could not have done more to check smuggling than it vas able to with the means at its disposal. 3. ith regard to the collection of this year** crop the estimates made in the month of Fhordad of the current year forecast the total to be collected os about 194,000 tons and the total conjuration as 342.000 tons, leaving a deficiency of 140.000 tons to be supplied from abroad* Cf course the estiniate of the &lt;#*entity to be collected Is a maximum figure, and since reporto from the provinces indicate that owing to the dryness, of. the year a pert of the hardest hss totally failed, the saowif^fr left is eo Btiall that we nay only witJi difficulty reacli the estimated figure; ‘nevcrtheleaB extraordinary efforts will b© md© to collect the crop by every possible means and in order that the peasant’s surplus, with which the governnemt ordinarily has nothing to do? shall not fell into the hands cf hoarders and hucksters, orders have been given that it shell all be purchased by -leans of exchanges ag^lnot monopoly goods and through merchants offering the free market price; However, owing to the dryness of the ear m' unsatisfactory v^eathor conditions, a deficit of the (joantity indicated above is certain and etiergetie steps should now be taken to send tills quantity to i ran; I therefore trust that Your n&amp;cclleney, in order to assist the Government in its ■ssserea designed to collect the entire cereal crop, will take urgent steps to have a quantity of the wheat required shipped as soon an pocclble; ' our ’xcolleney nay rest red that tine ex tension of this assistance v/ill not merely/ Sense the Voveroment to dlmininh its strenuous efforts to collect the harvest und to combat iioardlng, but will fortify it in its resolve. ■ 4. regard to transport, as you ere auare, the Govemiaent has instituted e ergetie measures and it is to be hoped that with the formation of the Transport Co omit tec this difficult problem which has a fundamental affect on the whole economic life of h- 3 - the country, will he solved In a eatiafactory Eianner, hut It must not he forgotten t3i^t the reguX^tlon of the transport problem and the satisfaction of the country's fundamental needs depend on the delivery of a sufficient quantity of lorries and tyres, :lnoe most of the lorries already in ths country are laid up for lack of tyres and a rancher were destroyed during the ovents of hahrivar and a nxrdber are at the disposal of the UKOO, the transport needs of the country naturally cannot he net without sufficient help from ^hrond, ecordlr^y I hnve the honour to request Your Excellency to extent your full resistance in this natter ©Iso, In order that no cMsio may arise in the 3ion the country's food applies end in the satisfaction of the country 1 s other needs.

(296/17-15/42) British Consulate General, Tabriz, j~-' -- ■■■ ^- 15th August. .194^ Sir, ) w ^ 1 '' ^ ] In the spring of this year the strongest official assurances 'were.given that Tabriz stood in no danger of a wheat shortage, and indeed there seemed to be every reason for confidence that this centre of a relatively rich agricultural province would continue to enjoy a sufficiency of wholesome bread at a low price. 2. In June, however, the quality deteriorated owing to adulteration and presently the issue of official flour to the bakers was halved. By the end of July the official issue had ceased altogether and bakers were allowed to buy wheat where they could. There was at no time any shortage of bread of the dearest quality, at a substantially increased price. Poor peoole however had not only to pay more; they hadyalso to stand in queues for bread less wholesome than it had been previously. Then at the end of July the Governor General returned from Tehran and at once tackled the problem of the breat supply. He has succeeded in getting such supplies into the town that there is no shortage, but only at the cost of still higher prices. The cheapest quality now costs His.2 a kilo, whereas in the spring the price was His.1.20. 3. In Mr. Pahimy’s absence Tabriz had as acting Governor General Mr. Muvassaghi, the Governor, a man with pro-German connexions and himself worthy of suspicion as being pro-German too, while as Mayor there was his crong and our old enemy of the last war, Bluri, a dishonest and even sinister pair. Muvassaghi failed in his duty to compel the wheat monopoly department to organise emergency means of transport to bring in stocks known to exist, despite premises to me that transport would be provided, and that there would be no shortage. For his part Bluri failed to have the bakeries supervised; no check whatever was made on the quality of the bread sold to the public. Meantime the current, and popular, explanation of the shortage, bad.quality and increasing price was that Russia was buying wheat to feed her starving armies. It was evident that the discontent with the bread supply, whether brought about b u the dishonesty or incompetence of officials, or engineered by them in the enemy interest, was as much in the German interest as anything their Fifth Column could contrive. It seemed altogether too convenient for the Germans, too inconvenient for the Russians and ourselves, that there should be unrest in north Persia simultaneously with the beginning of the German offensive in Russia. 4. My Russian colleague agreed with my view and we decided- to take concerted - action. In the first instance we asked the Director of Finance to furnish us with particulars of the last year’s crop, to indicate what reserves remained in hand, and at what point these reserves were stored, and also to give its his estimate of this gear’s harvest. Ve proposed, once we had these facts before us, to -see the Director together, and if necessary to press him to take suitable action to ensure the town’s supply. Despite reminders I had not received any statistics by mid-July; and on July 18th I called on the Director to enquire pointedly whether there was anything in his regulations which prevented him from giving me the H.M. Minister, British Legation, Tehran. /necessarynecessary information. To my surprise I found Mr. 'uvassaghi there too and he stayed throughout t ie interview, uext day the Director left for a tour without giving instructions to his staff to produce- the figures. He v;as obviously deliberately obstructing my Russian colleague and myself and I have no doubt that Mr. Muvassayhi incited him.so.to behave. I &amp; ive these details at length in order to; correct, so far as Azerbaijan is concerned the impression of Persian u willingnesee to cooperate convened by paragraph 5 of hr. Squire’s progress Report on the wheat Supervision Scheme d ated 5th ,Jul.^ 1942. It is net clear fro n his circular letter.No.37/21/42 of June 19th whether the.Ministr^ ’s Confidential letter No.13813 of June 16th was eventually eent to Tabriz; if not, I hope the Ministry may yet be induced to send it to its representative in Azerbaijan. It would be a lever in my hands. 5. The only immediate result of my visit to the Director on the 18th was a strong rumour that T and the Soviet Consul General were demanding an estimate of the wheat surplus, so that we might remove it for the use of. the British, and Russian troops. I am satisfied that the report originated in the Finance Dept, itself, but the bnlyudirect evidence-which T i have was provided by my-munshi, and it would diminish his usefulness if T were to quote it to the local authorities. As, however, the report caused anxiety and resentment, and led numbers of people to try to hoard wheat at increased prices, ' r pretested to the Director as in the terms of enclosure No.l, sending a copy to the Chief of police. 6. Mr. Fahimy returned from Tehran on July 29th and I arranged that Mr. Kalougenkcv and I should see him together on July 30th. At our preliminary talk Mr. Kalcugenkov told me that of 3000 tons of wheat arriving from Russia for the Persian Govt. 2500 were already at Julfa-. He was ready, he said, to do what he could to let the Tabriz authorities borrow some of that, and also to let them use Russian military lorries to a certain extent, but only if such measure were strictly necessary. M‘/e were agreed that the Tabriz authorities should be made to solve their difficulties themselves, if possible. Sc we gave /_r. Fahimy a somewhat difficult half hour, although he came near to disarming us at the outset by admitting frankly that there was in hand only a limited issue of grain for two days, more, and by enquiring whether the Russians could lend wheat for a fortnight or so. We said., in perfect' unison, that in our view the ex-Governcr, Muvassaghi, the Director of Finance, Firouzan, and the Mayor, Bluri, had not used the energy which the case demanded. We named places where surplus stocks of wheat existed - e.g. Rez&amp;ieh, Soldum, Maragha, the Karadagh, and we stated that no reasonable attempt had been made to bring wheat from these places. We complained that our interest in the wheat problem had been twisted as if to serve the purposes of. the enemy by the rumours, almost certainly originating in the Finance Dept, itself, that what we intended was to remove the wheat surplus from Azerbaijan. We quoted as obstruction, most unmerited from an important official of an allied power, the Finance Director’s failure to produce statistics at our request. finally “••'r. Falougenkov suggested that Mr. Fahimy should seek pehmissicn to borrow for Tabriz some of the wheat arriving via Julfa.7. Mr. Fahimy had no defence tc put up. He returned my visit next day and told me that he had instructed the Director of Finance tc call on me without delay with the available figures about the crops. He undertook to scotch the rumours oi which we had complained by inserting a dSmenti in the press, and T attach (enclosure Vg.2) a translation of the notice which duly appeared in all three Tabriz! papers. 8. Mr. Firouzan duly called as premised and produced figures of no great value at that late stage. He made a poor impression; he pleaded illness, the inefficiency of his staff, and unsettled conditions as reasons why r he had been unable tc procure and furnish the data for which we had asked. He blamed the government’s policy for the present shortage of wheat in Tabriz and described' hi s squabbles with the Finance Ministry in Tehran for possession of a reserve of wheat at Bustanabad, forty miles south of Tabriz. If Mr. Fircuzan’s fertility in evading responsibility were only equalled by zeal for action, Tabriz would have no shortage of bread. 9. As regards the future, the Governor General and the Director have taken or promised action as follows: a. On August.2nd they assembled the landlords of the Tabriz district and secured estimates cf their share of the harvest, and undertakings that 70^ cf the amount indicated would be sold to the Government at His.1200 per ton. b. Five ovens have been contructed by the Finance Dept, near the silo, where bread of good quality will be baked at a low price as a check on‘the town bakers. c. The Governor General will negotiate with the Russiansin order to secure their cooperation on the western frontiers, to prevent the illegal export of wheat. d. The Director will continue his present tours throughout both Ustans in order to obtain from landlords undertakings to deliver agreed quantities cf grain at points within reasonable distance of their villages, bearing in mind transport difficulties. e. The Director will make known the financial facilities now available for the development cf local means of transport. He will try to interest private individuals with idle capital and he will also try tc bring into service, for the transport cf wheat, the large number cf camels still available in Kurdistan, in the Karadagh, and in the Shahsevan tribal areas. f. The Director will maintain the present arrangement whereby peasants are excused payment of municipal tax on arrival at Tabriz, and have it “deducted from the amount pay-able tc them for their wheat. g. He will continue to issue permits freely to private individuals for the direct purchase of reasonable amounts cf wheat for private use, and will not require them, as was dona in the past, tc pay' to the wheht monopoly the percentage! of profits which the monopoly would have realised if the transaction had been made through it. (This is designed to bring wheat from the villages into the town and tc form, a reserve which the authorities could use in case of need). h. The Director finally will do all he can tc encourage the peasants to sell their surplus tc the gevernmSnt. - I would be misleading you if I did net state' clearly in my view these fair promises will almost certainly not /be 10 . thatII be fulfilled. These officials v»ill have to he constantly harried to obtain the action we desire, ana although shall gladly do all in my power tc give effect to your wneat policy, you are aware that until I have a Vice Consul here I cannot possibly apply the sustained, pressure which is required. The main obstacles are . a . normal Persian inertia and inefficiency b. dishonesty, rampant in'all grades c. hostility tc the occupying powers which pervades all classes, official as well as private, with the possibility that many officials actually work in the interest cl the enemy. 11. Tn paragraph 2 of navingram Vo.lbT of July 13th to the Minister or State it is stated that’the north-west provinces do ’’not greatly interest the Persian Government as past experience ’’gives them no hope that the Russians will assist or even allow ’’export to the Southeast, as a result all available surpluses are ’’being sold at a large profit tc Iraq and 'Turkey. The Persians ’’cannot and the Russians do not do anything tc stop this. This is T think, slightly misleading, and it confuses cause and effect. The Persian Government in Tehran no doubt pretend that the Russians orevent them from getting wheat from Azerbaijan, but, on the eviuence of the Director of Finance here, they were much interested to transport wheat from Rustanabad to Tehran and were prevented, not by the Russians, but by him. He brought a long squabble tc_an end by borrowing Russian lorries and bringing the wheat to Tabriz, tins being easier for him than organising transport to bn-ng m wheat from less accessible centres. Whatever the Russian attitude m tne 1HS t T am sure that the Soviet Consul General &amp;t least is now awake to the danger that the enemy will use wheat shortage-as a weapon for creating trouble and he has given me convincing P^cof of willingness to cooperate in the application of an allied policy, r wo 1 1 d not therefore rule out the pcssicility of obtaining from Azerbaijan a substantial surplus for use in the south, provided it can be collected. Of its existence there can be no doubt in this -■ear when the harvest is the best in thirty, out it is coviously necessary tc prevent the illegal export to Turkey and Traq. This is the cause, not the result, of unwill ingness if there is any, _cn_ the part of the Hnssisns* - tc see wheat go south ircrn Azerbaijan. T't is Persian subjects who are making fortunes from that traf-ic and in a recent telegram I have given the names of two generals who, from Kermanshah, are alleged to have organised and developed the traffic. Of all measures for the conservation of the country s wheat supoly the most effective would be better control of the Iraqi and Turkish frontiers. The Russians say that have latterly strengthened their posts on the west of their zone, out tnat L ^ canrct effectively cover the whole of that difficult country. i y have therefore asked the Colonel commanding the Gendarmerie here tc establish frontier posts, additional tc the Russian, of men knowing the languages and the topography. He has ’’referred the ’’matter tc Tehran”, that official sink into which sc much disappears, without trace or prospect of recovery. ,r • T have the honour tc be, etc., (Signed) R.¥, URQUHAKT.

I am informed that in my absence rumours have been spread that the Russian and British Governments, being in great need of foodstuffs, have started to buy grain in Azerbaijain, and in this way are transferring abroad the food of the country. Although the foolishness of these rumours should be clear even to a child, nevertheless I deem it necessary to inform the public that our neighbours, with whom we have made an agreement, have no need to buy wheat from Tran, but on the contrary, having friendly relations with our Government, and being- interested in our welfare, have several times offered to supply us with wheat if we were in need of food, and now 3000 tons of wheat, bought from the Russian Government, have been brought from Julfa for which we are very grateful.

Some of these landowners have over a hundred villages, and should be able to hand over at least 1,000 ons of wheat or more each. But they are powerful and well- connected in many cases, related to deputies and personalities in ehran, close friends of the Governor—General and so on, and have no intention of selling their grain at the Government price of 42 uOinans pel khai’var when all around them the ,, black ,r price varies from 60 to 80 and even up to 100 tomans. In former years fear of Reza Shah was the beginning and end of wisdom, but his son and the changing Cabinets inspire no such wholesome respect this season. The gendarmerie are not seen away from the few main roads (and not much even on them), while the array is not seen outside the chief towns. Majidzadeh says that the Iranian G.O.C., Western Area and the Gendarmerie have declined to give him and his finance officials the support and protection they needed, but this is by no means certain as he is accused of neglecting to ask for such assistance, out of a desire to let the situation deteriorate and to cast the blame and odium on the Governor—General and other senior officials here. Yet it is certain that in the western part of the province a state of administrative confusion, not to say almost anarchy prevails Wheat-transactions (apart from small buying among peasants of the same or neighbouring villages) are still the monopoly of the Government, but recently quite a traffic has been going on between the Pusht-i-Kuh and Luristan areas and the Shahbad and Sinjabi districts in the North. It is true that the former areas have had poor crops and need wheat badly, but i+ should have been the business of the Finance Department to provide for this, to estimate the real needs and make arrangements to supply them from the first wheat available. The afflicted areas however, knowing their Finance officials, have been sending relays of pack-animals north, and in order to avoid awkward questions and stoppages at any gendarmerie posts on the main road which they must cross, provided themselves with permits from the various bakshdars of the well- provided areas, stating that the bearers (unnamed) had special permission to buy and transport wheat, although they knew full well that no wheat should be touched or moved until the Government quota, had been handed in, v/hich is certainly not the case this season so far. The finance Department says that in some cases, the permits were signed by small boys in the Bakshdar fathers* absence. In some cases ^0°* the caravans were held up by gendarmerie posts in suite of the permits H but Majidzadeh declares that on reference to Kermanshah orders were given by the Ustandar*s office that they should be released and allowed to go south. The Bakshdar of Mahidasht, the next town to Kermanshah on the Bagdad road, seems to have been particularly industrious in issuing these illicit passes, no doubt for a suitable consideration. Some of the wheat so transported to Luristan was doubtless intended for smuggling into Iraq* Mahidasht itself has been a notorious area for the smuggling- business to Iraq, although it lies well away from the frontier. The/The curious thing is that no attempt has been made by the Finance officials here to get wheat from this area or from the other towns betv/een Kermanshah and the frontier, where common- sense might have been expected to tell them to make special efforts to prevent grain disappearing. Instead, any feeble and hand-to-mouth attempts so far have been made in easy districts on the main road east of Kemianshah such as Sahneh and Kangavar, although Majidzadeh is well aware that the Ministry in Tehran has its own eye on supplies from those places. It is true that efforts are being made to collect wheat in the Kalkhur area near Shahabad, but it is the State Domains trying to get their dues as landlord, not the Finance Department. In any case they do not appear to be doing very well, as so far they have been unable to supply anything to the A.I.O.C. at Naft-i-Shah in spite of urgent and repeated requests, whereas in previous years 280 tons were delivered to the Company by mid-August. These Domains* officials are very shy and resentful of the presence of our Liaison officers, for reasons best known to themselves, and in which the proximity of the Iraqi border no doubt plays a part. 6. The above-mentioned Bakshdar of Mahidasht, one Jahan Bakhsh, in addition to giving illicit permits and running a kind of private gendarmerie under the eyes of the Kermanshah authorities,has also been organising a robber hand in cooperation with other village headmen and stealing defenceless peasants* wheat when ready. The luckless peasants have complained to the G-ovemor—General and to the Iranian G.O.C., but without reply or redress, they say. A month ago this Bakshdar was arrested by the Gendarmerie for some flagrant offence, but when brought to Kermanshah for trial he was immediately released by order of the Ustandar. It is said that certain members of the Ustandar*s family are using him to assist in the smuggling of their wheat from nearer Kermanshah, and for selling some at high prices to the r needy Pusht-i-Kuh districts. These Kurdish Bakshdars'are generally considered to have arranged matters with the Governor-General before entering into their posts, in which they know they have little hope of receiving the official salary attached thereto. There is for instance the well-known pro-German Bakshdar Ali Asghar of the Sinjabi tribal area, who is reliably said to be harbouring Akbari the murderer of the Government official Nazami in June last, but who visits Kermanshah and sees the leading officials with impunity. He was accused of preventing Finance officials from travelling about freely to appraise the crops as is their duty. If minor officialdom is so lawless, private individuals, landowners and peasants can hardly be expected to obey instructions from the central government over the wheat collecting business, hoarding, etc., unless force is threatened and, if needs bemused. 7. Towards the end of last week I saw the Director of Finance and the Governor-General to find out v/hether they realized how very unsatisfactory and in fact dangerous the food situation | was. I found that they did, but that neither had any clear idea ; what to do about it. Majidzadeh said the fault was that the Ustandar, who hindered instead of helping him, and declared that he intended to go to Tehran in a few days in order to obtain wider powers for himself and his department. The Ustandar said on the other hand that the critical situation was all due to Majidzadeh*s incompetence and personal spite, and that the latter was in fact bolting to Tehran and staying there in order to escape the coming storm and to throw all the responsibility for it on the Ustandar. The latter asked if I would agree to an urgent meeting being- called next day of all the leading officials, at which the situation could be discussed and any possible remedies suggested.8. The meeting was held in the office of General Shahbakti on August 16th, and Lt* Colonel Fletcher, the Political Adviser was also presen + # As before, the British Consul was expected to open the proceedings and to make all the unpleasant remarks about the shortcomings of the various people there present* Piquancy was added t 0 the atmosphere by the uresence of a copy of the Tehran newspaper 'Siyasa' in which an article openly described the j.amentable state of public affairs in Kermanshah thanks to the fUedi between the Director of Finance and the Ustandar, said that the poor population were almost starving as a result, and called for the appointment of inspectors to remedy this state of things at once. The local committee of the Tudeh (Nationalist) oarty had a hand in this. 9.^ After a suitable amount of the usual polite and shifty recrimination, General Shahbakti took charge of the oroceedings as I hoped he would do, and sent, for Colonel Farroukh, Chief of Gendarmerie, who turned out to be sitting in the next room. A number of decisions based on the chief difficulties ventilated during the discussion were arrived at, chiefly by the masterful General. They were a) a military officer to be appointed tempo rarily as Bakshdar at Mahidasht and a few troops to be sent there to prevent more removals of wheat, b) General Shahbakti to issue a proclamation to all landowners to sign their undertakings to deliver wheat, c) the Bakshdar of the Sinjabi to be ordered to help Finance officials at once to visit villages there, and to stop the removal of wheat from his area, d) General Shahbakti to order the Governors of Shahabad and Ilam to help the collection of grain from the ex-Shah s estates, to earmark it for the needy areas in Ilam and report on the further needs of that district. 10. General Shahbakti several times promised to give all the assistance in his power, which means his considerable personal i prestige and the backing of the Gendarmerie. It remains to be seen whether this first dose of semi-military stiffening within prescribed limits will do anything to retrieve the almost spine- failure of the civil administration of this unruly area to achieve results in the food problem at this somewhat late hour. . \ is P° ss iDle that many peasants and small landowners will be inouced t° toe the line, but I am still doubtful whether the large anc influential will do so. The Governor—General himself has large estates in a rich district, and has already received full payment for his wheat in advance (which is against the rules?) but is handing in wheat comparatively slowly. He swears to me he will hand in every grain, as an example to others, but his enemy Majidzadeh declares he is selling some already at ,, black ,, rates to hoarders. Ano+her official who is not hostile to him tells me that some of the wheat sold at Mahidasht at high rates came from the estates of Amir—i-Kull 1 s family and relations in the east, and that is why the obstreperous Bakshdar there enjoys such immunitv and why the gendarmerie who stopped some wheat caravans going South were immediately ordered to let them go again. The Ustandar f s two uncles Salar Ashraf and Zabir-i-Mulk are behaving in an abominable manner on an estate entailed by the Waqf or Pious Foundations, seizing produce and revenue scandalously in antici pation of a Judgment pending in the Y/aqf Courts which according to my inicrma -ion should certainly go against them. I have sooken to the Governor-General about these goings-on, but he is obviously unable or unwilling to step them, and the spectacle is not edifying or exemplary to other greedy landowners here. This report however is not intended to be a criticism of the Amir-i- Kull, who is the best candidate for the post from our point of view, and probably is behaving much better than many other Ustandars in the country, and no worse than one of his lineage and upbringing might be expected to do. Bu'^ the picture presented may perhaps serve to show what is the state of provincial government/government here, at a time when we perhaps tend to expect logical results in economic and agricultural matters few of which are likely to surpass 30% or 40% of expectations unless the new Government now being formed can bring about a kind of miracle. With the Allied military position over the Caucasus momentarily ^worsening, local transport and communications becoming more difficult, and as staple food and clothing become more scarce and expensive, this is indeed a lot to expect for the time being. The new Farmandar here confesses that he has not one capable assistant or one clerk whom he can trust, and at the Municipality it is the same. Over-centralization and minute regulations prevent local initiative, and the higher officials are burdened with routine work, about a half of their clerks being admittedly useless and the rest mostly not much better. H» ^ way be mistaken, but I often feel, allowing for Persian insincerity and flattery, that more people here than one would think would welcome some kind of British intervention to improve matters. Many realise the danger of the present position and are becoming scared. We get a good deal of the blame for what is happening, if only because in most Persian eyes silence gives consent. Pew are conscious of the help which we may be giving them in Tehran and behind the scenes, and those officials v/ho do realise it are not prone to advertise it in our favour.

Government should not levy a tax directly on another Government, but that there should be no exemption where the tax is levied directly on some third party, even though the burden is passed on to the other Government in the form of increased prices. In Iraq, for instance, where His Majesty s Forces have a treaty right to freedom from taxation, we have resisted a claim that 10th Army which slaughters cattle m its own slaughter-houses, snould pay the tax normally collected from the slaughterers. On the other hand, we have no objection to the Iraqi Government amending their law to enable the tax to be collected from the merchants who sell cattle to the 10th Array and who will presumably raise their prices accordingly, 2. In order to facilitate consideraticpn here, please telegraph further information on the following points (a) What taxes, if any,' do our military authorities now pay .

It is true that the harvest in some p*rts of tie country has not been good, but against this there mu at be set the fol lowing frets*— (i) In many «reas such as Axsrbaljsa end Isfahan the crops have been well above the average, while in I horassan they have never hem better, and a rotf^h estimate hi? our aonsul-fcneral in lie shed -Ives the smrptas ns erver 40,000 tons.

I saw Dr.Amini this raoming and discussed the food situation in v various provinces: KHU-ZI3T,Aff♦ He had only just heard of Diwahbegi’s failure to secure any of the Rais ut Tujjar*s surplus, and told me that the Government were not prepared to sit dtown under this. Their policy is to he to insist on the landlords delivering their surpluses at the Government rates even if force has to be used to achieve their pur pose. The whole question is to be finally decided on Saturday and he promised to let me know on Sunday what was going to be done. Meanwhile Government are pursuing the policy of purchasing the peasants stocks at a more generous price, and are inclined to the proposal that the. . 1 . 0 . 0 . should be asked to purchase as much wheat as possible in Khuzistan to be divided proporticnately between their own areas and the towns of Ahwaz, Khorrarashahr and Bandar Shahpur, I pointed out that here and elsewhere the Government were making diffi culties for themselves by allowing bakers to buy on the black market for the needs of the towns, and heads of families to buy for their own requirements* If any buying is to be done it must be done by one agency only and that preferably not a Governmental one. Dr.Amini agreed. SHIRAZ. Dr. ^mini admitted that Prince Firuz had been % given permi sion to buy the peasants share of the crop at anything up to 2,500 Rials. This does not affect Government’s determination to collect from the proprietors at the fixed rate. In this connection he took a note of my suggestion that as soon as this procedure had been put into force all other buying by bakers etc. should be stopped. ISFAHAN. Dr.Amini admitted that no purchases had apparently been made so ftar, but said that General Zahidi, who was now in Tehran, had promised him that there would be no great difficulties in doing this if only they would send a strong man as head of the finance Department with full authority to take any measures that micrht be necessary. Zahidi is apparently himself to assist. Here again, free buying from the peasants is apparently to be introduced side by side with strong measures against proprietors. I understand that ration coupons have been issued in the Isfahan district, and will shortly be issued in other districts, en titling country people to buy piece goods, tea, sugar etc. in the towns* Orders are being issued that payment for all such goods pur chased is to be made half in cash and half in wheat. This should be a very useful measure. AZciRB.AIJAIT. The 5,000 tons from Russia is now beginning to arrive in Tehran. On no account will the Ministry of Finance agree to Tabriz helping themselves to some of this wheat en route. The local authorities are entirely responsible for any shortage there may be, and have beai told to get busy in collecting from their own districts s 2. Dr.Amini also asked me about the A.I.O.C. scheme for purchasing 4,500 tons of wheat in exchange for 15$ piece goods, etc. and the balance in cash at the Government rate. I did not.know if the scheme was still practicable owing to the fiasco in Behbehan, but I assured him that any stocks handed over to the A.I.O.C. would only be disposed of in the agreed proportion against deliveries of wheat, and that any balance would be returned by the Company.

I said that according to all our reports local officials were making no r serious effort even to ascertain the exact surplus, still less to collect it and that if there was shortage of bread m the towns it would be owing to corrupt collusion between land owners and officials. There was no sign that hoarding law would be , applied. Minister for Foreign Affairs claimed that our information was incorrect and then attacked our policy oi : bringing Poles through Persia, He had to admit that uhey • consumed no Persian wheat but asked why the Allies could send flour for Poles and none for the Persians. He could not deny that at least there ought to be wheat for the greater part of the year, or explain w% in Kermanshah, which is a wheat centre, bread should be scarce and bad one month after the [grp. undec.: Vharvest], 3 .

It has obviously been the policy oi the Government to try to secure wheat for Tehran from us m order to avoid the necessity to put pressure on the land owners. 4 The United States Minister informs me that he has reported to Washington, where also the Persian Government had appealed for wheat, on basis of information and arguments supplied by this Legation and has said teat at tne worst there must be wheat in the country for many months.

Present: Soviet Ambassador and Monsieur Ivanov. .American Minister. His Majesty’s Minister and Mr. Squire. Mr. Squire’s note of the 5th August was discussed. As regards supplies for Tehran it was agreed that we should first do what we could to help the transport of wheat from the Hamadan - Kermanshah areas and from Julfa. His Majesty’s Minister suggested that some of the tyres which have now arrived might be released to the Persian Government on condition they were solely employed 'in bringing in wheat for the capital at least in the first instance. This was agreed to. As regards Julfa, the Soviet Ambassador said that a certain amount was required for Tabriz where apparently they had no wheat, but that the rest could certainly be brought to Tehran. He thought that a small reserve should be kept in the Tabriz area, but this would depend on the situation there. If sufficient local stocks could be produced no reserve would be necessary. 2. Mr. Squire pointed out that there was no excuse for any shortage of local stocks in either Kermanshah or Azerbaijan, and that if pressure were brought to bear on the local authorities to get hold of local stocks this would be of great assistance and also be in accordance with the policy of the Ministry of Finance. It was agreed that Soviet and British Consular Officers should be circularised, urging them to do what they could in this direction.3. As regards general policy, the Soviet Ambassador agreed that, with a black rate of anything up to 4,000 rials per ton, it was difficult to expect Government to be successful in purchasing at 1,350 which, he said, was the present price in Azerbaijan, he was, however, opposed to our urging the Government o raise the price, as this would inevitably increase the cost of the poor man’s bread. He agreed, therefore, and Mr. Dreyfus also consented, that the Persian Government should be urged to exercise its authority to collect wheat at the fixed price and to take severe measures against hoarders. He agreed that his consuls should be instructed in this sense, and we said we would do the same. (Initialled) G.F. SQUIRE. British Legation, Tehran . 5th August, 1942 .FROGRSSS RSICRT WHSAT aUFSRVlSlON ^CHEMS leriod Sth ■» 51st July, 1942 Only slight progress has been raade during the past nionth in the task of finding suitable officers for the scheme, and this must seriously prejudice its chances of success as the harvest is now in or in process of being gathered, and in many places is fast disappearing underground. The failure of the Persian Government to take effective action before the crops are removed from the threshing floors makes the task of our Consular Liaison Officers who do not arrive in good time very much raore difficult. 0. It was not possible to put into effect the proposal to empby the Free French profeasors referred to in my last report as when sanction to the proposal was received they had left Tehran on their holiday and could not be recalled in time to make their employment for the short time remaining of their vacation worth while. In their place, Monsieur Brasseur, another Free Frenchman, has been u to Isfahan, and as a temgory measure Mr. Vaughan-Russeil, lately His Majesty’s Consul in Rermanshah, has f been sent to inaugurate the work in Shiraz. The Government of | India have been most helpful. Captain Kassan is now on his way ii to wor : in Kerman, and Mr. Simmonds and two officers from Burma, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert and Mr. Bourne are leaving India for ‘»Basra by the next available ship. 5. Government officials have in general been helpful, especially in the Kermanshah district, where in spite of the Minister of Finance’s desire not to publicise the activities of our C.L.Os, r. Kazi has been introduced to many of the leading land- owners and has already been able to intervene successfully in such matters as the adjustment of inaccurate scales, etc. In acme cases Finance Department officials have resented outside interfc and are even said to have oeen spreading reports that the f! of British C.L. Os proves that the British are indeed taking I wheat out of the country. Measures to counter such rumours, which \ are inevitable, are now being iak considered. 4. In spite of this hostility some of the reports so far received give hopes of limited success, but in Khuzistan it seems as if this scheme has already ended in failure as the Government, after loud ^roCastiationSof determination to act with energy, lias cravenly abandoned all attempts to purchase wheat in the Behbehan district, which is the one area where the crops have generally been recognised to be excellent. There is little chance, therefore, of successful action in the rest of the province. than in the rest of the province, the most influential personage is the Rais ut Tujjar, a very wealthy landowner who has to hand the allegiance of most of the district and who Mr. Le Rage reports to have some 5,000 tons of wheat at his disposal. This he is unwilling to sell to Government at the Government price. In spite of his irriiructions from the central Government to take drastic action regardless of rank, the Governor-General, fearing the possible results and not daring to take such action against the Rais ut Tujjar, has weakly agreed to accept from him an amount of 80 tons only as his surplus, and to barter certain additional quantities, required for Behbehan itself, for Government sugar. For the rest, the local market has parently been freed. Bathing will therefore be available for the towns of ahwaz, Abadan and Rhorraushahr except what can be bought in the open market. t^ is hardly ,ossible for us to object, as our policy has all along 5 In Behbehan, where Government authority is even weaker /beenmm - 2 - ——- : been to press for a higher price of wheat, and at the moment ther^ds no Persian Government to whom we could protest if we would.* The results are at present quite unpredictable. In this paradise for profiteers it may well be th t the price of eat will for a time reach super-Syrian levels, and that \ ozistan will try to make up from Southern Iraq what Kurdistan has lost ts. by smuggling to Mosul. Finally prices will presumably adjust themselves to the Iraqi level, but what the effect will be on the other parts of iha Persia itself is, at the moment, hal’d to say.

In reply to the letter Ho. K—41V )/144/34 of the lath July 1942# signed by Sir kaurice Peterson, on the instructions of ay Government X have to state as follows. The question concerning the organisation of an Allied Food Commission consisting of the representatives of Great Britain, the U. «UA., and Iran, was discussed soae time a*o in Teheran, between the Ambassador of the U.o. f i# x. — Mr. Smirnov, the 2 inieter of Great Britain - Sir £•¥• Bullard, and the inistcr of the U.S.A* - Mr. Dreyfus. In the course of this discussion the Ambassador of the U.S.3.R*, Mr. Smirnov, expressed an opinion against the creation of such a Commission, on three main grounds. In the first place, in the case of such a Commission being organised, the Allied Powers would be compelled to take the whole responsibility for the food situation in Iran, and thus relieve the Iranian authorities from such a responsibility, and this would be quite inappropriate. In the second place, in view of the ^r^vity of the food situation in Iran, the said Commission from the very beginning would be compelled to consider solely the Iranian claims of various food requirements. In the third place, the formation of the said CojatTiission would completely kill the initiative of the Iranian authorities, which even now is very . inadequate, in the question of organising the food supplies for their people. j - Rt. ’Hon.

In accordance with our practice in Irag and Egypt, no customs dues should be /oaid on goods imported into PerHa by the 10th . t rmy for their own consumption. But as regards exioorts, there is no precedent for_a British army stationed in a foreign country exporting local produce on a considerable scale and the Persian Government ^ might well claim that we ought to pay dues on such exports in accordance with our undertaking in Article 4(1) of the Treaty that the presence of our forces vail disturb as lit ole as possible the '‘economic life of the’’country and the applications of Iranian ’’laws and regulations”. 4. I t her fore consider that export dues should be paid on exports by or on behalf of the 10th Army of goods which would normally be exported and on which export dues would be paid. The criterion shpuld, as you suggest, be whether the exports in question involve the loss of revenue to the Persian'State® 5. I agree that this question would be settled direct with the Persian Government, without regard to the Soviet Government’s practice. But if the latter pay export dues on all goods that they expert, it scorns acsirab e that the Persians should receive at least as lavourable ticatmcnt from ourselves as from the Russians. 3 O-Leii 70 /uF M-t fVy.

Moreover, the supplying @ countries, to whom rubber in particular is more precious than gold, will not accept such orders in future unless they are satisfied that tyre stocks now comin into the hands of the Imperial Government are also used with the utmost efficiency for essential work. v *he circumstances, ray United States colleague and T V ..10 share the desire to s- e Iran provided regularly with the ’ ? eanS 4 .? f ^ad transport, see no alternative to the i mediate . orelation by the Imperial Govern 'ent of a Hoarf, Transuort board which shall ensure the imposition! of the necessary control as Lv h! tlng spare parts and tyres, and over such supplies wfich^arr r®J‘ Uir ^ d in future.

My United otates colleague and I are of the opinion the Board should be set up at one®. In a dition to the Persian representatives and a representative of the U.K.C.C., Messrs. Minor and Cumberbatch would represent the United States and British Legations, pending the arriva! of the experts. Having studied the Imperial Government's detailed assessment of the country's present needs the Board should proceed to the allocation of roughly one-sixth of the 3000 tyres now coming into the Imperial Government's hands from the steamship r, Steel Navigator'. It should thus be possible to provide for the most urgent transport requirements, while at the same time avoiding the distribution of all the 3000 tyres.

With reference to my telegram No,787 a nd to my despatch , u— ' ^o»184 of the 11th June, I now hare the honour to transmit herewith 9 0 |£?^l a tion^of the law passed by the Majlis on the^4th Khordad 1321 ju^e (2-5th May, 1942) giving the G-overnment full powers to deal with hoarding and the collection and distribution of wheat and foodstuffs. °• In pursuance of this law, the Persian Government have set up a special Department to work directly under the President of the Council to put both the new law and the toti-Hoarding Law into effect, but it now seems dear that their main object in waiting, in spite of our frequent representations in the matter, for the passage of the second bill, was merely to procrastinate* The new Department has done little which could not equally well have been done under the regulations to enforce the earlier law (vide ray despatch ITo*184 of the 11 th June), which themselves did not appear for two and a half months after the law itself and were, in fact, only circulated to the provinces for action last week, over a month after they had appeared in the official Gazette. Owners of the commodities specified as public requirements have at last been ordered to furnish statements of the stocks thev hold, but there is no guarantee that anything more will be done. I’he only other action that appears to have been taken so far seems to have been the arrest of a number of persons whose names have recently been communicated to the Prime Minister as hav^ing made offers to sell wheat to us on the Black Market. Unfortunately, these were found only to be small agents without any stocks them selves* Possibly they were acting for larger holders, but this has not been established. 4. Meanwhile it is difficult to estimate how much hoarding there is. The Chief Engineer, Nofrth Persia, has recently been trying, with the approval of the Minister of Finance, to'buy wheat direct within the official price limits, but he has so far succeeded in obtaining only very small quantities. Either hoarders are holding out for a far higher price, or are afraid to sell to him for fear of possible consequences. The Minister of Finance maintains that there are no hoarded stocks of wheat left, but there is much evidence to the contrary, and it is more likely that there is a plot on the nart of landowners, deputies, merchants and even higher Government Officials themselves to make the situation out as bad as possible, so as to in duce us to import further supplies, to save them from the necessity of taking unpopular measures against influential persons and to in crease the opportunities for illegal gain.

I feel aura that after studying the whole matter thoroughly* Your Exoellency will do whatever poasihle to meet the wishes of the Iranian Oovemment and to allay their great anxiety. May I once again reiterate in writing the essential points in connection with the economic assistance required by Iran for Your Kxoellency*# perusal. In the opinion of the Iranian Govemraent the minimum quantity of wheat required by Iran to be imported is 120*000 tons, and the minimum requireaenta in connection with means of transport are lOOu larga sles lorries, £0,000 tyres, and inside tubes and spares mostly for lorries to the value of £300*000. Of these, 30,000 tons of wheat and 10,GOO tyres of ths larger siae are most urgently needed. Believe me My dear Excellency, Yours sincerely, (Signed) 3.H. Taqlsadah. The Bight Hon.

A note explaining the general position as regards wheat collections and the failure of the Persian Q-ovemraent r ,° ^ adequate steps to meet it has already 'been circulated. Some 73 f 000 tons will have been imported and handed over to one ; ersian G-overnraent by the end of the coming month, and this should be sufficient to tide them over until the present harvest is in. ^ requirements of the Persian G-overnment for the ieeding of the towns are approximately 350,000 tons a year to which snould perhaps be added a further 30,000 to 50,000 tons required for labour employed on roads and other military works for which special provision of bread has to be made. The jersian Government are of the opinion that this amount cannot possibly be obtained from the present harvest which, owing to short sowings in the autumn, unrest, and the failure Wil1 be imch below normal. It is gener ally admitted that crops in the North and East of the country as as 'k* 16 Tehran, Isfahan areas have been good, but in the South the official view is extremely uessimistic. It is not possible to make any exact estimates,'but it is believed that the situation is roughly as follows BAST PERSIA KBRMAK PARS &amp; BUSHIRB KIHJZISTAN Crops well above normal, should be suf ficient for the needs of the provinces of KHORASSAN and MSKRAN with a possible surplus of some 2,000 tons available for export to KERMAN. Good in parts, but deficient in the South. Estimated deficit some 4,000 tons, part of which can be made up from EAST PERSIA. In the South the crops have been a total failure and at least 350 tons a month is required to feed BUSHIRE and the coastal region. PARS may have enough for its own needs but even this is doubtful. Crops are reported to be poor and the official estimate is that not more than 4 or 5,000 tons ou£ of a total of 30,000 required will be available. It is believed that this estimate is unduly pessimistic and that it may be possible by energetic measures to obtain practically the whole of the province's requirements from the present harvest. ISFAHAN TEHRAN KERMANSn &amp; THE yySSTERIT DISTRICTS Crops are excellent and should be enough to supply the whole area, which normally requires assistance from the V/es^. Crops are excellent, but the area is not big enough to supply more than a small fraction of the needs of the capital. Crops are mostly excellent, though there has been failure in some districts. It is on this province and on AZERBAIJAN that TEHRAN relies almost entirely for the bulk of the 100,000 tons of wheat required to feed the capital for a year. Azerbaijan /AZERBAIJAN A THE NORTHERN PROVINCES - 2 - Crops are believed to be excellent. AZERBAIJAN normally supplies about 30,000 tons to TEHRAN but owing to unrest and smuggling over the Western border it is not kno«n how much, if any, It will be poaaible to bring in this year. 3* The official estimate of the Persian Government is that there will be a deficit of at least 100,000 tons for which It will have to ask the Allies to provide shipping space. If energetic measures can be taken to collect all the crops that are in the country, to prevent smuggling across the Western borders, and to transport all the surplus to the areas where there is a deficit, it is believed that the country should be self supporting. Every extra ton that catn be obtained from the cultivators and the hoarders will mean a ton of shipping space saved for more important imports. (3gd.) §+F.Squire.

Popular explanation which does us harm is that-the allies have hired large number of local lorries for war purposes and diverted to them imported tyres and spares while remaining lorries are falling into disrepair. While there is some [? grp, omtd: truth] in this, fact remains that the Persian Government have made no effort to control and organise free motor transport in the public interest and to prevent waste ful ^ speculation in tyres etc. Discussion with United States Minister and Sir Prank Nixon resulted in the conclusion that Persian civilian motor transport not hired by United Kingdom Commercial Corporation should be controlled by a body representing Persian,^British and American interests. This body should rationalise traffic, ration tyres and petrol, make recommendations as to requirements in lorries tyres etc,, promote any legislation required and encourage the use of supplementary forms of transport f The Prime Minister, to whom I mentioned the scheme, received the proposal with satisfaction and I am now putting it to him in writing. He is of course aware that the scheme is subject to your approval and that of the United States Government, I trust that you will approve the proposal in principle. My United States colleague suggests that work should be done by a sub committee of C.S.C, rather than by a special body and when our talks were in an early stage, he telegraphed his Government who now state that they share his view. The name of the body does not matter and we might accept this proposal. 2. I have proposed to Persian Government with the support of United States Minister that suggested three party body should begin immediately by allocating 500 lorries tyres about one^sixth of a consignment ordered from America by the Persian Government and just received. Unless distribution is controlled, there will be much corruption and speculation and public benefit will be small. VIZ, i. T. I3, United Kingdom Commercial Corporation would be represented on the proposed scheme* Their experience and knowledge would be invaluable. Alternative proposal viz* that United Kingdom Commercial Corporation shouldhave monopoly of Persian motor transport and meet Persian civilian requirements in addition to their present duties was open to certain objections and has been rejected by Sir F.Nixon. In this I entirely agree with him. Please see my telegram No. 611 ENCOM. 1.. I have informed my Soviet colleague of the proposal* He showed some interest but no desire to^ participate. I will keep him informed. The position of the Russians is unlike ours in that they cannot assist materially and that they contributed to the shortage by requisitioning large numbers of military and private lorries during the occupation and are keeping them for their own use.

Persian administration have also demanded customs duties for Spviet goods imported for the needs of'the Soviet troops in Persia, but Soviet authorities do not agree that these should be treated as commercial goods. Equally unjustified is the Persian Ministers statement'that the Soviet authorities are buying foodstuffs in Persia and exporting them to the Soviet Union in such nuantities as to cause a shortage in Persia. M For the last year and the beginning of this year, the Trade Delegation of the U.S.S.R. purchased in Persia less than 50% of the cattle which the Persian Government had previously agreed to. With regard to rice, according,to the understanding between the Trade Delegation* of the U. S.S.R. and the Persian Ministry of Finance, 99% of rice exported to the U.

At a meeting with the Soviet and American representatives, however, I found the former strongly opposed to the formation of such a board On the grounds that Persia^would present it with impossible demands and themselves do nothing to improve the food situation. There is something in this though I pointed out that Persians were already adopting that attitude while we had no organ through which to exercise pressure but I suspect that the Soviet Ambassador does not wish some of his murky economic transactions to be brought before the United States Minister and myself. The United States Minister who had previously approved the plan tended to side with the Soviet Ambassador. In the end the following decisions were taken. (1) Each of the three representatives to urge the Prime Minister to create a Ministry of Food with a Minister em powered to deal with all relevant matters which at present are the concern of four or more Ministries (we have information that [grp. undec. ] Prime Minister appeared to be well disposed and promised to recommend proposal to the Cabinet).

Some of the Southern districts in these areas are bordering on starvation while the towns are fed only on wheat imported from abroad, supplies of which are now coming to an end. Khuzistan. This is always a very difficult province where certain big landowners have more influence than the Government. It was first decided to free the province from all control and let prices find their own level# This would have admirably suited the profiteers and would probably have resulted in the whole wheat crop being cornerea and released only at famine prices. Government, therefore, changed its mind and re-imposed control, at least on^paper. But the landowners appear to be defiant, and it remains to be seen whether Government will be able to assert its own authority, A new Governor-General and new Director of Finance have been appointed especially to deal with this question# Kermanshah, including Ra madan and Arak. Insecurity in Kurdistan and the prqximity pl the Iraqi border where high prices prevail will inevitably result in some loss to the Persian Government, but it is anticipated that considerable quantities will be readily availaole for purchase# Isfahan and Tehran # Control in these provides is fairly effective, and no great difficulties are anticipated# 3. As regards paragraph 3 of your telegram, it is true that in Meshed and Yezd districts the selling price has been nearly 4(kabove the price of purchase, but in Tehran the difference is less than 5^, and the average is about 13&gt;o.

Obviously the present difficulties of Iran in respect of the above questions are in no small degree due, t&gt; the events of last August with the entry of the forces of the iHliee Into Iran ana their being stationed in th&amp; country# The Allied troops, whose exact number though unknown to the Iranian Government lias never apparently been fewer than 50,000, have acquired for their use a considerable quantity of local food supplies. In addition to this a large number of i^lish nationals, whose number can be estimated at between thirty and forty thousand, are living in Iran and their llvellhooa naturally constitute* an additional strain on the food supplies of the country. Furthermore, a large quantity of fooustuffs finds its way out of Iran either by being Higgled out of the country owing to the prevailing situation referred to above which on the frontier makes complete control imp© sible; or in some cases by being directly purchased The Hon. Blr Alexander Foreign Office, B. .1. n# G, /and oiZfdh K^/l~ yu c U)c °) U^j M ^\a c ( ^*&lt;*-**) M-l JrOL_s| oand exported by the .Allies. It is not possible to deterxnirie the exact 'luantity of foodstuffs thus taken out of the country as the observance of the usual declaration of such goods at the Customs is often refused. However, the scarcity of food which is prevalent throughout the country and is daily growing in intensity is a clear indication of the considerable quantity of food supplies th*t ia continually flowing out of the country Finally, vorkNB numbering about 70,000, who should normally be at work on the land, have been occupied in rai^ and road construction for the Allies. Consequently these ren are not only unable to contribute to the production of food for the nation, but their livelihood is to some extent a further burden on the country* a food resources. Xt will thus be observed that the actions of the Allies have, directly or indirectly, adversely affected the food situati m .In the country. With regard to the country^ means of csoiamanication, as hfs repeatedly been pointed out, apart fro® the fact that a number of cars and lorries amounting t &gt; 473 were requisitioned or otherwise loat at the time of the occupation of Iranian territory, the United Kini-doi Oomercial Corporation have now in their service a large part (about 1500 - amounting to practically 40 ) of tho entire fl«et of lorries In the country, thereby leaving available a relatively small number out of all proportion to the trail sport requirements for the necessary distribution of wiioat, etc., throu^rhout the country. The U./ .0.0., not being eoaate t with this, claim for theameelves the exclusive right to distribute the quantity of tyres and spare parts apportioned to Iran by the U.b.A. On the other hand, although the U.K.O.C. have for some time past promised their assistance in the matter of executing orders placed by the Irani* n Government for tyres end spare parts, they have eo ffcr not only rendered no assistance in thie reapeet, but they have on the contrary availed themselves of a great pert of these order. Moreover, the Trans-Iranian Railway, as well as the Tabris Railway, is under the control of the Allies and serves to carry their supplies. It is therefor© hoped that it will be appreciated that the request of the Iranian Government to be enabled to meet their own transport requirements is not asking for a gratuitous favour, but Is rather an expectation of a return for the benefits which the Allies have derived and are deriving from the entire r«s&gt;ourc©s of the country* The Iranian Government and people accordingly expect that the Allies wixl fulfil their promises of assistance to relieve the economic position of the country as stipulated in the Tripartite act. The assi tance so far rendered by the Allies during the past ten months falls short however of the vital needs of Ira.. If, in view of the foregoing, the Iranian Government have felt themselves justifivKi in persisting that their reasonable requests be complied with, can they be justly charged withF X /-x bwt Kof* ty&gt; i/SLzcd' ? took ot appreciation of the assistance so far rendered to theniV Mould not the Iranian Goverii eat in their turn regret that the assistance ao far received in retun, for the nany benefits the Allies have undoubtedly derived, from Iran should be so in signifies# t? fhe sugg. stions that the Imnian Oovernr/ieat have been tardy in seouring the available stock of the country’s corn, that the price offered for sheet has been low and that the officials have not been efficient in collecting the stocks would not seem to conform to facts. as a matter of fact the price of wheat has been raised by 150 during the past year in the various parts of the country* but as the agents of the Allies* without th ir observing the regulations* have pure lino . - oJiOi)ol,; aid lion- ono -ol; gopdc^ the price of t 11 Kintiu of corrnoditieB has risea abnomally and the owners* in expectation of still higher prices, are reluctant to disposex of their goods to the Government* It therefore follow© that the difficulty in collecting the available stocks of wheat in the country is als&gt; to a certain extent due to the interference on the part of the Allies* agents* fhe Iranian Government desire to emphasise that in making their representations they have been careful to refrain free exaggeration or extravagance and have never put forward any unreasonable ©.cairns. On the contrary* they have always been miauifui of the prevailing transport difficulties* and what request© they have so far made have been with due regard for the international situation and the minimum need© of the country* and they have therefore endeavoured to make them as modex*at e ss possible* Accordingly, the Government and people of Iran look forward to th© ,.lliea* taking into consideration the economic situation of Iran, the deterioration of which has been principally due to their own operations| and further, having due regard to the promises tiiey have made in tMs respect in th© Tripartite I act, to take Immediate steps to comply with the reguests ot Iran. If the anticipated fulfilment oi* these request® is not forthcoming at the appropriate tim, th© MUNiati m l , Iran will be liable to deteriorate and tho consequences will inevitably devolve uafavourrbly on both Iran and the Allies* The most preeeing need at present i© the supply of ZO t OOO tons of wheat and 10,000 tyres in the course of the fort!co' in three months f the delivery of which should begin by the first mearis available* I trust th; t Hi© Britxnnic Majesty’s C2ov&gt;mment, after giving due consideration to the foregoing statements, will see their way to meet the earnest wishes of the Iranian (Sovern exit and I shall be very grateful if I am enabled to return a favour^ible reply to their coarsmmieation# I feel sure that the eymp&amp;thetio consideration of the very important au.d, I should say, vital matters contained in the above oswsunl cation would be most highly appreciated by my Govei*nmerit. - 1 an* etc** ( igned B* ; :.

In addition I assume 500 tons of barley can be promised to Persia at once. Persian claim for barley is greatly strengthened by the fact that the Russians are now pressing her to sell a quantity of foodstuffs including 15,000 tons of barley partly from existing stocks but chiefly from the coming harvest. Tne Prime Minister says that he has been forced already to hand over 2,000 tons from Azerbayan,Riu, Ahmedabad Alonzcb [group undec. J and Khorasan.

They explained that the position today was as follows:- 1) Existing stocks are 1,700 tons Ahwaz 1,800 Bijar and only 500 at Tehran 2) Possible sources of supply from Russia are 5,0 00 ton s reported already at Julia with further ^roblem/bf JUpy^SL 10,000 tons as an advance to the Persian Government, against future deliveries of rice. 5) Collection of crops round Tehran may amount to 50 tons per diem in ten days time rising to 100 tons. Situation will not be normal until the end of September. In addition to the request of 250 tons per diem for Tehran other centres such as Kerman Bushire and Yezd will together need 100 tons per diem. Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that the situation has become critical with only two days reserve rations in Tehran. He emphasises that it is of the utmost importance to His Majesty^ Government, specially from the political point of view ; to give immediate assistance otherwise position of Persian Government will become impossible and chaos inevitable. He is convinced that food riots in the capital would play directly into the hands of the Axis at the critical moment of war and be highly detrimental to our interests from every point of view and in these circumstances he considers that immediate assistance from us is essential to enable Persian Government to make declaration without delay to calm public opinion. Although I fully appreciate the complete failure of Persian authorities to handle the situation properly, may I in view of the emergency, immediately Inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs whose demand remains at 50,000 tons that the 5,600 tons of/ I^ECd.

REPEATED TO FOREIGN OFFICE NO. 872 .-7 Bagdad and Government of India Saving. 9 kkkkk On July 1st the Prime Minister informed me in a state of panic that Tehran which required a daily supply of 270 tons of wheat had only 180 tons left. He expressed the hope that I could take immediate steps to have about 3,000 tons of imported wheat brought up by rail from Ahwaz as soon as ( possible. As a result of the action taken by His Majesty s Legation about 500 [group undoc.] arrived here and a small quantity also due from Kasvin. The Prime Minister*stated that if the wheat crisis at Tehran was to he overcome, in addition to Ahwaz wheat 10,000 tons would he required from us per month for 5 months* 2* The Prime Minister is intensely anxious about his position and talks about resignation and bread riots-# Position and requirements seem to me grossly exaggerated as^the harvest in the south is almost completed and round Tehran is just beginning, but there must be inevitable delay before this year's wheat is available; in addition the measures so^far taken by the Persian Government to extract hoarded wheat have only consisted of the issue of regulations without any implementation# 3, It seems that stocks in Ahwaz area should be sufficient •for about seventeen days# It is then to be hoped that stocks will start to come in from other districts* It may for political reasons be desirable for us to help them to make up the deficit and possible way of meeting this emergency and saving shipping space would be despatch from Iraq as soon as possible of 10,000 tons of barley with further 5,900 tons to be held in reserve in case the position, has not improved by August 15th* [Copies sent to sent to Mr* Armstrong#] (JUjLl - C 1 ^. {IJUML (ujt, UsCd^tir' (1&lt;iji Mr. Holman.

Such a board,which should be given executive power, would direct the food policy oi the country in all its aspects. Its existence should instil confidence and would enable the Americans and'Ourselves who are primarily responsible for providing when necessary supplies of a hroad to exercise considerable control and give Middle Mast Supply Centre a slightly more accurate picture of food conditions here. It is of course impossible to say how the Persian Government would react, ihe latter are however at present extremely worried about the position and are beginning to realise their own short-comings and a scheme [? grp, omtd.: ?of] this nature might therefore be welcomed as a solution to their present difficulties.

Persia's difficulties are appreciated but when it is fully brought home to her Government and people that alternative is to run the risk of starvation their indecision should be more readily overcome. 2. It is of paramount importance that prices now offered should not only give fair return to the cultivators and ensure delivery of the crop but also encourage the land owners to plant increased areas for the next harvests Your telegram mentions a 50% increase in Pars and Khuzistan (with which I presume you are satisfied) but your Commercial Secretary's letter of June 6 th to Khan does not suggest that increases e.g. in Northwest provinces have been substantial. Can you confirm from Consular Officers that prices now offered in their areas are adequate for our purpose? What proportion of total area does this letter cover? 3o [?Grp e omtd: It is not] clear how far Persians intend to re-sell crops at enhanced rates but there is no doubt they have made exorbitant profits in the past and they cannot be allowed to defeat our object by pursuing this policy in future. Apart frem hindrance to the war effort and risk to shipping (which will almost certainly be unavailable in future) there is no justification for the import of 194-0 grain at greatly enhanced rates - vide Kerman news summary for the first half of May - and encumbering transport* in order to secure them a revenue which should be obtained by general taxation.

Allied occupation of main wheat-growing areas has naturally immensely increased Persian economic difficulties. Our army has exported large quantities of vegetables and is continuing to do so, thus throwing additional strain on the country s wheat resources. From Azerbaijan which normally exports 30,000 tons annually to Tehran and the south, Persians have so far only been able to secure 3,000 tons this year and have little hope of getting any from present harvest. 2 . Reliable estimate of crop position and of hoarded stocks is impossible to obtain. Mr. Squire's estimate of 80 per cent, o normal for western area was for irrigated and unirrigated .crops together. The former should nroduce 100 ner cent. But in upper very serious. an&lt; ither. The former should produce 100 per cei southern parts the situation is undoubtedly 3. Merely to raise the prices may only aggravate the financial considerations, the effect m osition, ;ht or \0^. 3 o 1~L as apart from purely be increase in black market rates with further difficulties countrv areas, even if town supplies were subsidised.

Q 1. Reports from Tehran hear out the unsatisfactory news that the coming harvest is not likely to be very promising. I understand that as a result of intense drought in some of the southern provinces of Iran, the crops have wilted and in the region of Pars in particular there is a noticeable scarcity of food. The Iranian Government stress the fact that with this bleak prospect, were the British authorities to refrain from helping Iran in the way of continuing the import of wheat, the country might easily be // faced by an unpleasant situation during the course of next ' year. Moreover, in order somewhat to ameliorate the ‘wheat situation, the Iranian Government suggests that the British army in Iran should arrange to import the whole of its wheat requirements. The Iranian Government on their part are resolved to punish any possible hoarders of this commodity and to seize the hoarded goods, but it is unlikely that these measures will yield sufficient result to save the country from the stringencies of the scarcity of wheat, which renders the question of its importation rather essential. 2. The British Government are well aware that the question of tyres is also one of the most important requirements of Iran as it affects the entire means of communication in the country, which in turn influences the whole of the feeding and distribution system of the different provinces as well as the establishment of law and order. The Iranian Government are of course most appreciative of the extension of the Lease and Lend Act by the United States of America to Iran. They are, however, perturbed by the news of a proposed arrangement between Great Britain and the United States which might result in the elimination of the ddrect delivery to Iran of any share of this commodity which it was hoped, as a result of the extension of the Leafce and Lend Act, would be apportioned to her. ^ May I also avail myself of this opportunity to revert to a point raised by me in our previous conversation about the price of small arms and ammunition which, at the request of the British authorities in Tehran was handed to them by the Iranian Arsenal and later on delivered to the Soviet Government by the British authorities. I understand that the latter gave repeated assurances in Tehran that they would be responsible for full payment of the price. This however has not materialised so far. This question has of course no relation to any arms or ammunition which may have been taken over by the Soviet Government and to which I presume Sir Maurice Peterson refers in paragraph (d) of his letter.I earnestly hope that you will kindly give favourable consideration to these matters, which I feel certain will be the source of much appreciation on the part of the Iranian Government. Believe me, etc. (Signed). S.H.

With reference to his former interview with me, he said he thought there had 'been some misunderstanding; the Persian Government admitted that we had paid for the 1000 lorries which we had taken over, hut he pointed out that at the same time that number were now subtracted from those at the disposal of the Persian authorities with a disastrous effect upon the transportation facilities in Persia. The Minister handed me the annexed list of Persian minimum requirements which he said he thought had already been communicated to His Majesty 1 s Legation. He asked for sympathetic consideration of these requests. The only other point which the Minister raised was that purchasesmade by the British authorities in Persia seemed to be uncoordinated and resulted in a heavy rise in prices. He suggested that it might be possible to have an Anglo-Iranian joint purchasing commission, but he did not make any precise suggestions as to how this should function. I said that I would submit the idea, and that if it were thought that it offered any prospect of success it might be further discussed. (Intled) A.C. 8 th June, 1942.mmm ^ — Copy.

Despite your endeavour to convince the Prime Minister of the folly of thinking otherwise he persists in regarding wheat imports as natural solution of all difficulties and his letter suggests that he regards such imports as almost certainly both necessary and forthcoming* 1 feel that Persia must be forced to abandon this attitude and I am reinforced in the view expressed in my paragraph 5. 2* Particulars of crop contained in Prime Minister's letter are most disturbing even if unduly pessimistic. Mr. Squire s statement that irrigated crops should amount to 70% of last year's and 80% of the normal is far from being re-assuring. I know that you will continue your endeavours to obtain reliable indications of crop and communicate them to us. 3# While essential that Persian Government gets hold of sufficient wheat of this year's crop to cover the needs of towns / also essential to ensure substantial increase of value of the area sown with wheat at the end of the year. This is further argument for substantial•increase in price designed-—7 to induce not only selling of this year's crop to Sinai?but also expansion of acreage.

D^. h\A Accompanied by Commercial Secretary I saw the Prime Minister to-day and left with him memorandum in general terms for guidance in dealing with wheat situation in Persia. I emphasized both frankly and strongly the immediate necessity for necessary regulations to be passed to enable hoarding law to come into force. I pointed out that unless the Persian Government dealt with this matter urgently and seriously and took action against hoarders they could expect no sympathy from outside. Commercial Secretary then proceeded to furnish the Prime Minister with figures as to hoarded wheat in the country and offers already made to Legation by hoarders. It was made clear that Persia must not expect supplies of wheat after next harvest and that if the Question were efficiently handled by the Persian authorities there would be no need for importation of wheat. _ In view of higher price paid for wheat in Iraq the Prime Minister must realise the danger of smuggling over frontier. It was a question of better frontier control or some increase in the price of wheat paid by the Persian Government. ^ The Prime i' 1 representations Minister seemed visibly impressed by the made to him with which' he found it difficult to disagree and undertook to have hoarding law put into force before the end of this week. He even suggested that he might ask the Majlis to approve the law giving him full power to take whatever action he thought fit and that he might appoint a special officer 19 deal with the whole question. He was particularly anxious to obtain close co-operation with the Commercial Secretary in the matter. The United States Minister made similar representations to the Prime Minister earlier to-day.

The inir*ter of &lt; 1 nance now proposes to construct a central bakery at which cheap bread, possibly of an Inferior quality, will be available for the poorer classes. Mean while they are considering the immediate division of the bakeries into two classes. The better of which will mipply bread of quality at uncontrolled prices, while the rest su ply bread from wheat v?ith a fixture of barley at a cheaper price, contraxxom by the Govarniuent. This, if properly carried out, should solve the local problem. TH&amp; I qc' f IM(3K3« except in Bushlre and Shiraz the critical ood o l i-rCSt Iran: - the 5,000 tons now being imported from India together with the supplies fro^n Sel©tan, which have not hit herto bo&lt;m available because that area ban been cut off from the rest of the country by floods, should be enough to tide over the principal difficulties in the outh. Meshed has apparently been able to arrange for suf ficient supplies Tor Itself, with Russian aaaistance. Keman t- the arjpplies now at andaj^ bbas, which are for the German ’istrict, should be sufficient provided that tie local authorities make roesonable eiuwmgemsnts for txaansport. ? r crmsB , s complaint in his telegram No,51, that the towns dif ficulties are due to all the transport having been utilized for unnecessary sugar Instead of vital wheat supplies, is being inquired i?ito by the Ministry of finance, o) /- 2 - c ) Yesd: - It has apparently been possible to get sufficient supplies from Isfahan and other places by Individual enterprise on the black-market to supply the towns essential needs. \ -ushlre:- will require over 300 tons a month for the whole ' ^Coastal area from now onwards, even if the harvest is as good as can be expected. Imrnediate requirements can be supplied from imports now coming in and arrangements will be made for future months as mtCU. be necessary. (Bushire f s request in tel.

If this can be supplied, and if the people are confident that it will be supplied', this will go a long way to ensure the security of the area. Stocks in Bushire, now coming up to hlraz, are sufficient for the moment. The Minister of Finance assures me that arrangements have been made for supplying lar, Jahrum and other areas which moat need assistance and that the inistey will now be able to oope vi th the rest of the demands without fail. f. Ipfnhan:- the crisis here has apparently passed with the opening of the silo by the Government for a proportion of the town's needs. This, and the promise of further supplies from Tehran has had the effect of bringing out the hoarded stocks and no further shortage is now anticinated. ths mmms. There remains the question of -hat should be done to see that similar shortage of wheat does not occur next year. It has been made quite clear to the Government that they can expect no — further supplies from abroad and must make their own srrsngemeiits. 'Theoretically the best solution would seem to be the freeing of wheat from all Government control and the collection of revenue by the Kr/ernment in kind instead of under the present system of taxes on all wheat imported for consumption in the towns* This solution, however, is not practicable as a reversion to the system of collection in kind would give rise to formidable difficulties andiKterwib^ew^fi quarrels between corrupt officials and elusive land-owners; and without a considerable Government reserve It is not possible at the moment for the Government to remove the wheat control as transport difficulties would make it quite impossible for them to cope with the operations of unscrupulous merchants who would immsdl ately do their best to comer all wheat supplies in order to make enormous rrofits. The present system must, therefore, continue but 1 urged on the Minister of ‘inance three important considerations:- 1) A fair price must be offered immediately for this and the cry :ing harvest, at which hoflfdero of stocks would be willing to sell without too much core ion. The minister thought that the present prices should be adequate, but ny information is that a further 10 ■ increase would be necessary. It is well worth the Oovernment's while to pay this, if by doing so they can be assured of getting in an adequate reserve to meet all conditions. 2) fforts must be made to reduce the opportunities for illegal gain made by hordes of petty officials in the l Finance department. This is the chief cause of Govern ment dixi iculties and of the out—cry against Government control.( A r ^ th e Compliments [CYPHER] ^.t.ry state H| Affairs DEPARTMENTAL NO. 2.

That on the Central (Birjand) section has been greatly hampered and delayed by the difficulties experienced by Messrs. Jaffar Jaffary in feeding their workmen. The contractors do not expect to finish the work until the end of June, and that only if the efforts now being made to ensure steady and adequate supplies of bread to the men are successful. The case is somewhat different with Messrs, Shirket-i-Hizhdeh on the Zahidan section, who have a special clause in their contract entitling them to claim from the British Government whatever they have to pay for their wheat above Rials 700 per kharwar. This clause removes any incentive to economise and there is reason to believe that the Company have kept up their labour supply by buying wheat for the men's rations at Rials 1,400 per kharwar from officials of the same Persian Department that is paying the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation less than 600 Rials for it at Nok Kundi'.p *' f - 0 P. 33 SECRET XXX Allotted to External Pegk Copies Circulated*.
