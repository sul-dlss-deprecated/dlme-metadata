The correspondence is concerned with whether or not it would be appropriate for Imperial Airways to assist the Californian company in developing aerial infrastructure in Arabia. In particular, the company feels it would be useful to be able to employ the use of aircraft between Bahrein and the area in which they are drilling, and between Bahrein and Jedda [Jeddah], where their main office is located. The possibility of the company forming an alliance/partnership with Germany is discussed by British officials. Copies of the letters were forwarded to the India Office and are included in the file (f 11 is a copy of f 5 and ff 12-13 are copies of ff 6-7).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrein</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jedda</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil extraction</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00028c#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00028c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
