Note by the Aga Khan and M. A. Ali Baig on the Situation in Egypt. (ij Au informal expression of onr views on some aspects of the political situation in Kgypt, and a brief reference to our endeavours to remove the uneasiness among some of His Majesty’s Moslem soldiers caused by the machinations of Turco-German agents, and at the same time to assist the British authorities in the formation of an atmosphere of mutual goodwill and understanding between the representatives of the Imperial Government and the Egyptians, may be of interest to the Marquess of Crewe and Sir Edward Grey. THE ATTITUDE OE THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE. (Lb In the course of our sojourn in Egypt from the PJth of December 1914 to the 12th of •January 191b, we travelled over a thousand miles and visited Ismailia, Sue/, Port Said, Tanta, Alexandria, and also all the camps of the Indian troops. Through the courtesy of the British Agency we had frequent opportunities of discussing Egyptian problems, especially in their relation to the new order of things, with the leaders of all shades of political thought, including the Prime Minister and lbs colleagues, the ex-Premier Said Pasha and some ex-Ministers, the leader of the Opposition, the President of the Assembly, the members of His Highness the Sultan’s family, the representatives of the middle classes and of the Press, the ecclesiastics, the Ulemas and others. Our iirst impression, which still remains unchanged, was that except for the evidences of considerable military activity lor the defence of the country, there was no outward sign that the Egyptians were in any way perturbed by the great W ar, which had drawn into its vortex and ranged on opposite sides the British and the Ottoman Empires. The historical Proclamation of 18th December 1914, which changed the political destiny of Egypt, was received by the people with a feeling ol iclief. I he long and chequered connection of Turkey with Egypt which was thus iinally terminated, had at different times^ and in consequence of varying policies, set in motion both cohesive and disruptive forces. I he lattei, owing chiefly to misrule and lack of political insight and foresight on the part of Egypt’s late Suzerain, had been acquiring an increasing ascendency when the British occupation of the country in 1882 profoundly altered the whole aspect ol Ecrypt’s future. We tried to find out whether the prosperity and progress resulting from the British connection weighed heavier in the scale with tie Egyptians, irrespectiye of the military strength of the occupying owei w nc i ensured the people’s allegiance, against the bonds of a common creed and to what extent, if any, the national sentiment of the Egyptians was influenced by cognate Islamic ideals and affected by the lurkish espousal of the German cause. In considering these points and the inter-reJation of the various factors, which seem to govern the Egyptian situation, it must be remembered that the population of Egypt, especially in the urban aieas, which constitute the centres of political thought and activity, is not so homogeneous as to be influenced in the same manner and to the same extent by recent events. ) From a political point of view the population oi Kgypt, alter making due allowance tor normal increase after the census of 190, may roughly be divided in round numbers into 1 1,325,000 Moslem Egyptians ; , 9o,0 0 Coots- 75000 Turks and other Ottoman subjects; U&gt;&lt;,0)0 Gieeks Italian, and Frenchmen; 43,000 Jews; and 25,000 British subjects-making ar. aggregate total of 12,400,000 souls. &gt;;&gt;y. ATHE MOSLEM EGYPTIANS. (4.) The Moslem National Hfe ofEg^t outside the involved ... Ae ftM, and K-I s ^ ream of hig religious and economic hie. which do not distnrt t 1 , .• i?o.

S^ttem ^ by no means of such a nature as to make him bm.don he solid advantages of good and impartial government lor the THE (’OPTS. (5 ) The Copts have nothing to gain and much to lose by any change m the present state of things, and their adhesion to the British cause may be fully counted upon. It appeared to us, however, that any leaning towards the Copts by the British authorities would result in a dangerous alienation of the Moslem Egyptian’s trust in their impartiality and sense of fairness. W e were told by many leading men that though there existed an honest desire to hold the balance even between the Moslem and the Copt, indications were not sometimes wanting that all real confidence was reposed in the latter. We did our best to convince the Egyptian Moslems that absolute impartiality was the key-note of British policy, and that their apprehensions were groundless. But we think that the necessity and importance of avoiding any action which may give rise to the slightest suspicion of racial preference for the Copt or the Moslem cannot too often be impressed upon the subordinate officials. THE GREEKS AND OTHER RACES. (0.) The Greeks who are in more intimate touch with the Egyptians, even in remote and small villages, than any other European nationality, and the Italian, French, and other foreign elements in the population, reserve all their loyalty and patriotism for their respective countries. They seem always likely to swim with the tide of real power when it does not conflict with their own national interests. The attitude of the Jews seems oppor tunist and inspired with a desire to lie left in peace and security. The British subjects are of course keenly pro-British. The Turks and most of the other Moslem Ottomans may be expected to be naturally in sympathy Avjth the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire, but they are likely to remain perfectly peaceful unless some unexpected upheaval changes their quiescence. p 4^ J •' e + 1 ? 11 !

Lapse of time and force of circumstances have greatlv weakened and m many cases entirely obliterated the Turkish sympathies of these men, who have developed a limited patriotism for the country of their birth and adoption, in whose fortunes they know that their life and well being are completely merged. The loyalty of these classes during the present ciisis may be counted upon j but, we venture to suggest that their adhesion to the British cause mav be strengthened by a statesmanlike policy of conciliation and of generous concessions to their sentiments and reasonable expectations. THE ASPIRATIONS OF El JURAT El &gt; EGYPTIANS. (8.) Some members of the influential classes mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and also the literate classes generally, including the upper strata of educated Moslem Egyptians, especially the students, are influenced by somewhat vague ideas of nationalism and independence; but we found that the more thoughtful and experienced men with whom we had con- versaiions were fully alive to the deficiencies of the Egyptian people in numerical strength and defensive power in the present stage of their social, intellectual, and political development, and readily recognised that they could not stand on their own legs without the help of a strong protecting hand. They clearly realised that in view of the geographical position of Egypt and the situation of the Suez Canal as a vital link in a world-chain of British interests, such effective support can only come from the direct suzerainty of Great Britain. Enlightened Egyptian opinion consequently seemed to us to lie practically solid in deprecating any eventuality calculated to disintegrate the fabric of prosperity, now being raised, or to cause a break in the steady moral and material advance of the country. The Egyptian politicians, however, do not make any secret of their aspirations, which tend in the direction of autonomy under Imperial protection or an uncontrolled management of such of their internal affairs as are free from international complications. They desire a gradual straightening out of these entangle ments and a complete and immediate sweeping away of the Capitulations. We are not aware whether in deference to Italian susceptibilities or for what other political reasons, which no doubt must be strong, the Capitulations are still maintained at the present most opportune juncture when their abolition might perhaps have caused the least disturbance in the international atmosphere, charged as it is with the absorbing exigencies of the War to the practical exclusion of minor questions. W 7 e understand, however, that the Capitulations are doomed to extinction at the end of the W ar, and to this consummation the Egyptians, we think rightly, are looking forward with confident expectation. iW) The educated Egyptians cherish the hope that the closer association with the self-governing traditions of the British nation, which has now been inaugurated, will eventually result in raising the political status of the country to a higher plane, with a local Parliament instead of a deliberative Assembly whose legislative activities under its present constitution can be rendered inoperative. They recognise the futility of aspiring to the manage ment of their military and naval affairs, which must remain under the control of the Protecting Power; but in the matter of purely civil legislation, which cannot affect Imperial interests, the Assembly’s powers, they think, should be widened within safe limits. (10 ) How far these expectations are within the range of practical politics it is not for us to say. but we agree in the view that a begmmng might safely be made in regard to the management of (j) the A\aqfs, (u) the* 1 Mahkama Shari’a, am! (iii) the Maglis ilasbi, which concern endownments, ecclesiastical matters and trusteeships respectively. II this is done an excellent political effect would be produced without ‘affecting the essentials of British control. The advent of the new Sultan would be signalised by an innocuous but important concession to Egyplain sentiment, and his prestige as a Protected Sovereign would be enhanced at the outset of his rule when his attitude of steadfast loyalty to the British cause is not altogether free from certain domestic and other difficulties. The concession would be gratefully appreciated by all classes of the Egyptian people, and their confidence in the motives and policy of the Imperial Government would be increased. THE PROTECTORATE. (11.) The rupture of friendly relations with Turkey combined with the hostile attitude of the Khedive Abbas II., who was reported by Sir Louis Mallett to have co-operated with the Turkish. Militarist party in organising' a serious menace in Syria to the British position in Egypt, had brought to the fore the question whether Egy pr should be annexed to the British Empire or whether the political status of the country should be settled in some other way. Phe repeated and emphatic disavowal in past years by successive British Ministers of any intention to annex the country had raised certain moral issues the settlement of which was being watched with keen interest and considerable misgiving not only by the Egyptians but, also by the whole Moslem world. Annexation, we are told, would have stirred up unfriendly feelings towards Great Britain in many quarters, and might possibly have led to serious complications. The constitution of Egypt into a British Protectorate at the present juncture is generally regarded as the most statesmanlike solution of a very difficult and delicate problem. THE NEW SULTAN. (IT.) Lhe gratification of the Egyptians at the decision of His Majesty’s Government has been enhanced by the happy selection of His Highness Hussein Kamel as the first Sultan of Egypt. He has a much stronger hold on the esteem and confidence of the Egyptians than the late Khedive, whose unceasing intrigues had poisoned the atmosphere of Cairo, and whose questionable monetary exploitations had created m the country and even among !us nearest relations a feeling of distrust and apprehension. The new Sultan is known for his uprightness and high sense of honour, his solicitude for the welfare of the poor, and his great interest in agricultural questions, on which the prosperity of a country like Egypt must largely depend. His antecedents and his early association with almost all the branches of the administration, including the portfolios of Finance, War, ublic Works,^ Interior, \\ aqfs and Education, inspire the people with confidence in his ability and knowledge of affairs. We were told that if a plebiscite had been taken the choice of the Egyptians would have been the same as that of His Majesty’s Government. ... ff'O ' e Imye had opportunities of meeting and conversing with Mis Highness. Me impressed us as a strightfonvard, enlightened, and broad minded man. At our parting private interview with the Sultan, arranged at Ills special desire, Mis lliglmess confidentially hut quite frankly expressed his uevs on t ic c ang( m the political status of Egypt, and the difficulties of Ills own position W e gathered from his conversation that the role of a mere ornamental figurehead on the political chessboard, which he confidentlr lopcd was not in contemplation when lie loyallj-*assented to the proposals of the Indian Government, would humiliate him in the eyes both of the Islamic 0ll&lt;l ai ‘ l1 !' llls ?'!' subjects, and render his position intolerable. Me expressed .he conviction that, in view of his clean record and mature expe- iu nee, onh a policy ol mutual trust, confidence, and good will, coupled with a generous desire to uphold Ids dignity, with special regard to the powersand responsibilities attaching to the position of a Sovereign, could deepen the sense of friendly co-operation essential to the unhampered furtherance of Egyptian as well as Imperial interests. He asked us to convey to His Majesty and to the Ministers of the Crown a message of his sincere goodwill and his assurances of his faithfulness to the Hritish connection. He added that during the present crisis and in future his unswerving loyalty in rendering all possible services to the Empire and to his country may be fully relied upon. We were deeply impressed by the tone of genuine sincerity which characterised His Highness’ conversations, and w^e believe that his firm adhesion to the British cause is beyond question. THE MINISTERS AND THEIR ADVISERS. (14.) From the conversations of the Ministers, with almost all of whom we had opportunities of discussing the Egyptian situation in a friendly and informal manner, we gathered that they desired a free and frank interchange of views on the advice tendered to them before it was given effect to. It was hinted that it occasionally happened that a candid examination of the advice from a different angle of view was resented and attributed to obduracy. This naturally impaired in some degree the cordiality of relations between the Minister and his Adviser, and left unpleasant impressions on the minds of both. As a consequence, the removal of an otherwise capable Minister was sometimes rendered expedient, and the impression gained ground that only those Ministers who were willing to surrender their judgments would be acceptable. This was probably a somewhat over-coloured view of the situation, but the belief undoubtedly exists in the minds of many Egyptian politicians that freedom of judgment is occasionally at a discount. It is fully realised that in the settlement of questions which are vital to Imperial interests, firmness cannot be sacrificed to a hesitating desire for conciliation or compromise. It is also recognised that the effect on British prestige of an uncertain and vacillating attitude in a country where the people instinctively lean towards the authority which in their belief possesses the substance of real power, must be fully guarded against. But in ordinary circumstances an unbending attitude, which excludes an unprejudiced examination of any question, may sometimes be carried too far and produce results which in the long-run may be detrimental to British prestige, which can only be maintained on a foundation of justice and fair play. (15.) An atmosphere of mutual trust and goodwill which welcomes friendly and dispassionate criticism from either side, before the adminis tration is committed to any course of action, will, it is believed, advance the highest Imperial as well as Egyptian interests and inspire the leaders of the people with confidence. The above observations have no particular reference to the present body of Advisers, most of whom are held in high esteem. THE NATIONALISTS. (16.) The Nationalist movement, which aimed at the termination of the British occupation and the absolute independence of Egypt, received a check in 1907, when the ex-Khedive co-operated with Sir Eldon Gorst in repressing it. During the regime of Lord Kitchener the activities of the Nationalists were further neutralized and with greater effect by the measures he adopted. It seems, however, from what we have seen and heard in Egypt that the Nationalist spirit is not dead but dormant. The students, especially of the Law School in Cairo, and those who receive their education in foreign countries, are peculiarly susceptible to the propagandism of the Nationalists. (17.) The few exponents of Nationalist views with whom we had conver sations seemed to think that if a policy of greater trust in the representativesof the people is adopted, and ii in the governance of the country the good of the Egyptians and their legitimate expectations as a self-respecting nation are not subordinated to other considerations, the Nationalists would cordially support the British authorities. They admitted that the measures for extending cultivation and improving the material condition of the f ellah had been strikingly successful, but in their opinion the educational policy of the Egyptian Government under British guidance had been somewhat hall- hearted, and it left an impression upon their minds that a real uplifting ol the people of Egypt in the scale of nations w r as not desired for political reasons, which, they urged, should not be allowed to stand in the way of national advancement. THE EGYPTIAN PRESS. (18.) The Kanoun-al-Matbuat or the Press Law of 1909 has produced a sobering effect on the Egyptian Vernacular Press. At one time there used to be about 60 Arabic papers, and nearly the same number in European languages in circulation in the country. The number of the vernacular journals has considerably decreased recently. The activities of the Arabic Press in Egypt were inspired and developed by the different political parties, which under martial law are at present quiescent. The most important of these organizations are :— (1.) The Nationalist Party to which we have already referred. (2.) The Hisb-al-Umma or the People’s Party ; and (3.) The Islah or the Reform Party. The organ of the Nationalist Party, M-Lewa, started in 1898 was the most important political paper of its time. It was suppressed in 1912. Its policy was inspired by Mustafa Pasha Kamel. The Numb replaced the Lew a and subsequently Al-Alam. The latter was also suppressed in November 1914. 1 he organ of the 1 lisb-al-l mma—a party composed ol men of substance, the moderation of whose views was intended to serve as a counterpoise to nationalist activities is .1/ (iarula. I he paper has dwindled in importance since the resignation ol its editor, Luili-al-Sayed, an honest journalist whose idealism was somewhat out of tune with the realities of the situation in Egypt, The Reform Party, which identilied itself with the policy of the ex- Khedive, ventilated its views through the columns of AL-Moayijad. The paper was at one time ably edited, and often adopted an independent attitude, it has ceased to be ol much importance now. Of the independent papers the /U-. l/mzm, started in 187b, is the oldest and the best. It is an exponent of moderate and reasonable views, and its policy is pro-British. Al-Mokattam is another important paper. It is under the management of Syrian Christians whose policy is strongly anti-Turkish. The paper is looked upon as a semi-official organ of the British Agency, and the Moslem Egyptians, we are informed, view it with distrust and suspicion. In this connection we may incidentally mention that the attitude of the British authorities towards the Syrians is being watched with some apprehension by the Egyptian Moslems. The Copts have two organs, the Misr and Al-Watan, which watch over and advocate their interests. Among the European papers the most important seem to be the Egyptian ('(izette, Le 1 hare dAlexandria, Le Journal &lt;lu Gaire, I'Lgypte-Egyptian Morning Lews and La Bourse hgyptienne. All these are exponents of European views. It appears to us from what we have heard that under the combined opeiation of the I less Act and martial law, the Arabic Press has to a large extent ceased to reflect the trend of Egyptian feeling in all its aspects. The suppression of some of the virulent papers was, however, a necessary measure at the present juncture.THE CALIPHATE. (19.) in regard to the Moslem attitude towards the Caliphate, the Islamic world may roughly be divided into two groups,—the great majority of Moslems who profess the Sunni or orthodox faith, and a minority composed of Shias, Ibadhis, Kharajis, Zaidis and other minor sects. The question of the Caliphate concerns only the Sunnis, as the other sects have conflicting views on the subject. The historical origin of the Caliphate is clearly traceable to the emergent conditions which called for an immediate settle ment on the death of the founder of Islam. The iirst Caliph Abu Bekr was elected by the people, but he nominated before his death Omar as his successor. This precedent has been followed ever since in regard to the Caliphate, each successive Caliph being nominated by his predecessor. The Apostolic succession was maintained through various Arab dynasties until the Osmanli Sultan Selim conquered Egypt, and induced the last Abbasside holder of that dignity to nominate him as his successor. In this manner the line of Apostolic succession by nomination has remained unbroken until now ; and it is for this reason that the orthodox Moslems of India, Egypt and other countries look upon the Sultan of Turkey as the rightful Caliph of Islam. Whatever the consequences of the present war may be as to territorial adjustments, it seems essential from the Sunni point of view that the guardianship of the Holy Places should rest in the hands of a Moslem Sovereign who derives his title to the Caliphate by nomination from his predecessor. The efforts of the Young Turks to rally the militant support of Islam around the Osmanli Caliphate might perhaps have met with a less frigid response if Turkish rule had not been so markedly out of tune with the spirit of the time. The progressive tendencies of the age in their bearing on the welfare and elevation of governed nationalities cannot be dissociated from the purely spiritual aspect of the Caliphate The serious risks and harassment to which the depreciations of the Bedouins and the exactions of the local officials subject the pilgrims of the Moslem Holy Places in the Hedjaz and Mesopotamia, combined with the insanitary conditions which surround them, have naturally chilled Moslem enthusiasm as to the effects of the guardianship of the Ka’ba and Kerbala by the Caliph-Sultan of Turkey. It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that the Turks are “ detested ” by the Egyptians or other Moslem races. On the contrary, the traditions of the Ottoman Empire have never ceased to captivate the imagination and stir the sympathies of the Moslem World. But the Turks obviously miscalculated the psychological and moral limitations to which such sympathies must be subject. Apart from the question whether the Caliphate has really a religious basis or whether a claimant to that dignity must belong to the tribe of the Prophet of Islam, the expectations of the Turkish militarists that the blessings of good o-overnment, including a complete freedom of religious belief, would be abandoned at the bidding of the Caliph-Sultan were foredoomed to disappointment. . . , , c u It is, however, an acepted doctrine that the recognition ol the Multan as Caliph does not involve any political allegiance to him, and it is for this reason that the Moslems of Egypt and India have not wavered m their secular allegiance. But, in regard to the spiritual aspect of the Caliphate, anP intervention bv non-Moslem Powers as to the nomination of a Caliph is certain to be attributed to political motives, and no Caliph so nominated can be oenerally accepted. It would be wise to leave the solution of this delicate'question to the judgment of the Moslem people, who, m course ol time, will meet the situation according to Islamic traditions and doctrines. THE JEHAD FETWA. (TO ) The Fetwa of the Sheikh-ul-Islam of Turkey about a Jehad or HolvWar has fallen upon entirely sterile ground m Egypt. I he people are quite unconcerned about it This Fetwa consists of some cryptic Ayes to a series of ingenious questions formulated by the War party in luike} Tito assumptions underlying some of these questions are more or less devoidffmindation in the politico-militarj- ^'^p^rtwliUes of &lt;»nversing. f toimaa with whom we nM , a( | an coun tries may re 0 0g» 1 b t . iid , n m o*er JU^mmaaan^ ^ «««r German propagandists.

THE INDIAN T’ROOTS. were informed by Generals Wilson, Cox and MelUss, that there amono 'the trans-frontier Modem soldiers, especially (22.) We rBXis’aS K^hattaksfYusufzais, Swatis and Afridis, as to certain ‘spec s o the war with Turkey. In the opinion of the rmbtary authorities, Tmkth Dents were undoubtedly trying to get at the Mnsnhuan soldiers, and there was evidence to show that tire trouble began even before the l ' 0 °hiethews'held by these men were that they should be led against the as they were given to understand in India that the war was with of being asked to fight the soldiers of the Caliph-the Turks—who were the natural guardians of the Holy Germans, Germany, instead • ■ n ii Places. They seemed to believe that Islam prohibited internecine bloodshed among Moslems. They also thought that the Entente Lowers had aggressive designs on the Moslem shrines and aimed at the destine lion of Islam. At the suggestion of Generals Sir John Maxwell and Wilson we visited the brigades commanded by Brigadier-Generals Youngliusband, Cox, A. Watson, H. Watson, Geoghegan, and Melliss. We were accompanied by Major-General Wilson and Brigadier-General Bingley, Chief Staff Officer. The troops were drawn up at their respective camps, and all the Generals and other Officers were present. After the usual formalities of inspection and introduction by General Wilson, the Native Officers were assembled in groups. The Aga Khan addressed them in Urdu, meeting the miscon ceptions arising out of the Turco-German intrigues point by point according to the Shariat and Islamic doctrines. It was pointed out that Islam imposed upon them the duty of being true to the salt of the Sarkar under whose aegis they enjoyed complete religious liberty, and that accordingly in the armies of Russia and France thousands of Moslem swords were drawn in the defence of the righteous cause for which the Entente Powers were fighting. It was impressed upon them that the British Sarkar had always befriended and protected Moslem nations ; that the inviolability of the Holy Places was guaranteed during and after the war by Great Britain with the concurrence of Russia and France ; that Turkey, in spite of the proffered guarantees, assurances, and promises, which would have secured the safely and advanced the interests of the Ottoman Empire, had been dragged into the war by Germany and a junta of Turkish chauvinists, who were entirely influenced by political reasons ; and, that the war was in no sense religious as evidenced by the attitude of Indian Muliani- madan Chiefs, the Amir of Afghanistan, and many other Moslem potentates. Ihe recent elevation of Prince Hussein Kamel to the dignity of Sultan of Egypt was mentioned as the most recent instance of the manner in which Moslem countries were protected by Great Britain, and their Islamic tradi-tions maintained. The arrangements made in England for the beneht of Indian soldiers, and for satisfying the religious scruples of both Hindus and Moslems were explained. The gracious solicitude of the King-Emperor for their welfare was alluded to, and a hope was expressed that they would justify the confidence His Majesty reposed in them by gloriously maintaining the traditions of the Indian Army, and by adding fresh laurels to its achievements. CONCLUSION. (2d.) We are greatly indebted to General Maxwell for his generous hospitality. Our gratitude is also due to Messrs. Cheetham and Storrs for the numerous interviews thev arranged for us. We may add in conclusion that no opportunity was missed by us of impressing upon those with whom we came into contact, the benefits of the British connection as evidenced by the present conditions in India, and of pointing out that the Protectorate had opened up a new horizon of boundless possibilities for the good of Egypt.
