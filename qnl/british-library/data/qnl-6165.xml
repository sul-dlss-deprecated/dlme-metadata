JACKSONUacler Flying Soal 7^ No.F/^/ (1/80) THK POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT, September, 1949. Dear Fstfebllghfiient 4 Org&amp;nlsctlon Department, ^ ^ , As Yo« «r« aware we have two locally engaged Arab staff here, Mr* Israel Kaddo, the Interpreter and Mr. Abdul Mohsin, the passport clerk. . .? hen the Forel S n Office took over this post on the 1st Aorll, 1948 the new terms and conditions of service for such staff were not known and It was not until October, 1948 that Mr. Kaddo and Mr. Mohsin saw the new Foreign Office con ditions. They stated on the 3rd October, 1948 that they were prepared to accept the conditions but wished the 60 days leave thrt they had accumulated during the two years of Government £service prior to their absorption by the Foreign Oifice to be allowed to them or, failing that, for payment to be made in lieu. 3. We consulted the Hesidency at Bahrain who agreed that they were both entitled to the 60 days accumulated leave but the Residency pointed out that a grant of pay in leiu of leave was not vermissible. 4. No formal contract was entered into and no letters were exchanged with either Mr. Kaddo or Mr. Mohsin in resoect of their employment with the Foreign Office? and it is difficult to know exactly from what date they came under the conditions. We consider that as they signified their agreement to the new conditions la October, 1948 they should be retarded as subject to such conditions as from the «^L Ir 2 r,th %rvl that for the period from the 1st April, 1948 to 30th September, 194£ they should be regarded as being subject to the conditions applying to their temporary service with the Government of India. This is similar to the position of the Indian staff here who, until the new Foreign Office contracts were given them on the 1st June, 1948 were subject to Government of India conditions although paid by the Foreign Office. 6 * ,^ anxious to regularise their position and we should be glad if you could accept liability for the 60 days accumulated leave based on the mean of their salaries for the two years immediately prior to the 1st October, 1948. 6. It would appear that of this 60 days leave three quarters (i.e. from 1st October, 1946 to 31st March, 1948) is chargeable to the Government of India and one quarter (freai 1st Arril to 30th September, 1948) is chargeable to t 5°«r F ?r cigr3 will perhaps approach the Government of India regarding this liability. Kaddo and Mr. Mohsin are aware that it is consi dered that they are entitled to this leave and had it been possible to allow them the leave previously the matter would have been raised earlier, but our complete inability to find temporary replacements, a necessity in this post in the case of long periods of leave, prevented this. 8 ./ The Establishment 4 Organisation Department, Foreign Office, LONDON.- 2 - 8. It is indeed isnrobable that we will be able to let either of them take their aceramlsted lestvo until I960} but it is onr desire to regularise their employment by formal contract* Heithcr Mr. Kaddc nor Mr* Mohein ©re likely to agree to continue in Forejgn Office employ if the accumulated leave to which they are entitled is refused them* We have experienced great difficulty in retaining their services in the face of rising prices in Kuwait and the ether posts they could obtain. Local clerical staff are particularly hard to find on the present Foreign Office terms* 9* There is yet a further noint with regard to these two persons and this Is in connection with the leave they have taken since they changed over to foreign Office employment in 1948* 10* In Marchj 1949 Mr* Kaddo requested three months 1 leave (i*e. 60 ciayr accumulated leave plus 30 days under Foreign Office conditions). This was allowed but we were unable to find a suitable replacement for him and finally he was given 36 days leave from the 26th June, 1949 to 31st July, 1949. No replacement was engaged for this period. Mr. ‘Mohsin also asked for long leave. This was denied to him also as no temporary replacement could be obtained. He was, however, allowed ten days leave in July, 1949. 11. If It is agreed that these wen are subject to Foreign Office conditions with effect from the 1st October, 1948 as suggested, then 30 days of Mr. Kaddo 1 © leave and Mr. Mohsin 1 * ten days‘leave nay count against their annual allowance for the rerlod 1st October, 1948 to 30th September, 1949* The other six days of Hr. Kaddo f s leave can either be regarded as offaet against the 60 days accumulated leave previously referred &gt;o or can count against the leave which will be due to him for the period from 1st October, 1949 to 31st December, 1949. We propose bringing the contracts and leave entitlements of these two in line with the calendar year as from fche 1st January, 1960. 12. Vre should be glad of your approval to our proposal in pragraph 6 of this letter and your advice regarding paragraph 9.

(127/45/49) 26th May, 1949 tfould you kindly let me know whether you have yet found any relief for Israel when he goes on leave? as I told you when I was at Kuwait, there is a Palestinian school master at Muscat who has applied for a job as Mun- shi in Kuwait or Bahrain. I think he would probably be suitable for the appointment, but I gather that his motive is that he wants to marry a young wife who is used to play ing tennis, etc. and he thinks that she will have more free dom at Kuwait and Bahrain than at Muscat. In this, I think he may be disappointed. 2 . If you wish it, however, I will ascertain whether he would be willing to accept a temporary appointment at Kuwait during the summer months while the Muscatsehool is closed. Please let me have an early reply, as if he accepts the offer, I shall have to get Foreign Office sanction to pay his travelling expenses from Muscat to Kuwait and back before further action can be taken.
