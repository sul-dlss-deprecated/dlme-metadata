                           Lawrence, resulting in bombardment by the British; hostilities in 1926 between Fujairah and Kalba.Notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Residency Agent, Shargah; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd]; Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah of Fujairah; officials of the Government of India, the India Office, and the Foreign Office.The Arabic language material consists of several letters, most of which include corresponding English translations.
