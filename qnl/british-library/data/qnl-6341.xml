As Ion*; as they are for legitimate pirposes and he does not take advantage of us, of course we should give him as little trouble of such requisitions as we can. It would of course be necessary that his Nakhoda should get a pass from the Political Agent, Muscat, for the particular shipment that he was bringing away but I think the preliminary procedure should be that the Sheikh should inform you, prefer ably in writing, that he needs to import so many arms etc of such and such a pattern and ask you to get the Politucal Agent Muscat to issue passes for them. You would then ask the Residency to instruct Muscat. I think this latter step would be advisable, for then, on any particular occasion, if you thought that the requsition was not a legitimate one, but found it difficult to argue it with Sheikh Mubarek on the spot, you could prime me in passing on the request. In any urgent instance I can always employ the wire. In the present case it would seem best that Sheikh Mubarek should state the total amount of arms that he really needs and if it is in our opinion bona fide, Muscat will be instruct ed to issue passes up to that amount as required to cover instalments as shipped by mail or dhow. How do you think we can guard against illicit diversion of arms shipped under such passes, stipulate that tiiey should be returned to you as soon as the arms arrive. The above are my ideas for general line of procedure. In the present case which you have already discussed with him if Captain W.H.I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Aoweitif you find it difficult to proceed accordingly, use yotiir discretion but explain to him that yonr arrangement only covers this requisition and that you would like to consult me as to general procedure for the future*— » .

I have the honour to reply to your letter No.C.34- dated 7th June 1910* £• Nothing would, I think, be gained by our placing diffi culties in the way of Sheikh Mubarok ! s obtaining arms from Muscat for his pwn ordinary requirements, and under the cir cumstances explained in your letter under reply his present indent seems reasonable arid I am prepared to arrange the ne cessary facilities for 1000 arms and 100000 rounds. In order, however, to prevent the shipment of arms for him from serving as oppoi’tunities to Koweit Nakhodas to smuggle out extra arms under cover of our passes, it will be better if Sheikh Mubarek arranges to have them shipped by one vessel and gives instructions to her to call at Jask, or wherever en route I may arrange with the Senior Naval Officer, to report herself to one of His Majesty's Ships and show that her cargo is in order. At the time of loading it would no doubt be possible for the Political Agent, Muscat, to send a representative to see the cases closed, sealed and marked and then to communicate details to the Senior Naval officer. After hearing from the latter I will let you know oy next post what precise arrangements in this direction seem best and meanwhile Sheikh Mubarek might be making his purchases. 3. As however in your letter No.G37 of 15th June you report the arrival of another dhow believed &gt; be carrying arms, and as, theye supposing that Sheikh Mubarek seizes the arms/may be among themseme of the pattern which he wants, perhaps he will be able to meet his own wants in that way, and thms save any shipment from Muscat. I shall no doubt hear further from you on this point, I think it would be a good thing if Sheikh Mubarek could put his indent to you in writing, but please use your own discretion on this point.

I think we are bound to give him facilities for obtaining them, and have desired the Political Agent ^oweit to come to an understanding with the Sheikh as to the arrangements which will be most convemient for thePr safe conveyance from huscat/to Aoweit while ensuring that the permit is not taxon advantage of by the Nakhoda or by others in Muscat to smuggle up contraband aras in the same dhow; and then to communicate with you. On hearing from Captain Shakespear I request that you will take steps to provide the Nakhoda or Nakhodas convoying the con signment with a pass to cover it and to have the dhow inspected when she is ready to leave to see that her freight is in order, and that you will keep the Senior ^aval Officer informed of the arrangements which you propose to make. 3. It might be worth while calling upon the Nakhoda to report himself to and be passed on by one of His Majesty’s Ships on duty near the entrance to the Gulf if tho Senior Naval Officer agrees and could so arrange; but I must leave that to your dis cretion, the object being to ensure on the one hand that the dhow is not interfered with by any of His Majesty’s Ships whileYour demi-official lotter of 22 nd September re- 4th October 1910.

This was drafted Just after you left, on the strength of our conversation, and I thought was See also your first letter of 7th June 0.34. In the circumstances, km as we have agreed to his having the consignment on the grounds that he really needs the Arms, I do not think it is worth while cutting down the limit now and uhereby detracting from our accommodatory spirit in giving him the facilities asked for. Just to teach him a lesson. It would only result in a grow^/further request from him to which we should have to give in if he showed reasonable grounds for VA making it. I think we had better leave the matter where it is, the main point being that if he really needs the arms to replace others captAred from his men, we cannot reasonably refuse them aa we Know that ho lost about that amount or more; while, if in the terms you recommended. « or his Captain W.H.I.Shakespear howeit•DRAFT—(For Approval).

Your v/isdom 7/ ill thus cause you to understand that for similar reasons it is very important that 1 should be aware of just the exaat number of rifles and cartridges that you want sc that 1 may know how to instruct the Political Agent, Muscat,Muscat, 'Vhat I first instructed him was that he should give a safe conduct ^or 1500 weapons and for cartridges ac cording to the amount which is ordinarily sold with each weapon. Mow whereas your present letter was written on 20th Shawal (24th October) I have received a letter from the Po litical Agent, Muscat, dated a week later 27th Shawal (31st October) in which he informs me that your subject Haji Sadiq bin Ibrahim has just left on 26th Shawal with a consignment of arms and ammunition duly covered by a pass as per list enclosed, amounting to 600 weapons with 300 cartridges per weapon. As the dhow has only just left I think it will be some time before conveyance of the remainder can be arranged for, and sc I have time to write to you and get a reply. According to the present instructions which I communi cated to the Political Agent, ^uscat, as above mentioned, he is authorised to give passes for P00 more rifles and for cartridges at the rate of 200 per martini and 400 per Mauser. I think those you now refer to in your letter to namely the 300 Magazine Rifles and the extra Martinis must be in- cluled in the above total of 600 which have started and 900 which are coming. 1500 weapons and the necessary cartridges seemed natural and reasonable quantity for you to require while they are cheap, as the Political Agent and I know that you have many deficiencies and losses among your Bedouin adherents to make good, but 1 think you would be very unwise to import a larger number than that, at this time, for all these transactions get noised abroad as you know, and I fear that the gossips of Muscat and the evil wishess elsewhere would inevitably take your name in vain and say you were making Koweit a rifle emporium. But you are a wise man and know your affairs and what ever you wish I will explain to Government, but the above is how the matter presents itself to me and I think you will do well to consider very carefully before sending a further indent.(Continaation of Note, Precis or Draft.) iri yozir lottor to hiir he uhoTild limit hia proaont oh^Lpmonto tc that nTtmtx r* Ho oaid that woitld bo all right if ha,vc the ^agazino carbinoo. c OTlld emggootod hio dodT»cti:ig an oqnal number of ^artinio and ho agreed to thio after a bit that ao ho had ohown hio wanto yor: woTtld lot him chi a them at a ftttnro favourable opportrnity* I took the chance of thJ vc hoping t oiling t!p agony re Trrkich and other mioreprooontationo* etc. If I may venture to ceggoot-- he /d'/Xd' need be td chip only the remaining POO armc already allowed ycT» don’t mind the csb titntion of 300 Magazine carb Ma.gazine Pintola for an equivalent nTimb.)r of Martini leave him only 500 Martiniu to complete the 1500.

I found them to be of the same pattern as I wished for the use of my horsemen, and I went to Captain Shakespear one day before this date and showed him one of the carbines, he stated that you had ordered that permission will be given for what I require)^ at present and that I should purchase the arms and ammunition and keep them at Muscat under (your) disposal until we obtain permission to enable us to ship the same in a single boat. I represented to you that what I require at present are 500 short-barrelled b-shot rifles, 2000 Martinis ef long calibre and snorter ones, and as much cartridges as can be obtained because cartridge^ are used by the troops when there is any need and when there is none. I beg to explain to you the difference in the value at oWl side and at Muscat. A thousand cartridges at our side cost if 140 while the same number is sold at Muscat for k 60.

This number of cart ridges usually accompanied the rifles, even if the value be high. Apart from those cartridges you should buy a hun dred thousand cartridges for the five-shot carbines and you may likewise buy two thousand Martinis of long calibre and of shorter ones each rifle to accompany two hundred cartridges, and you should similarly purchase six lakhs of the Martini cartridges. The value of the 5 shot carbines and of the Martini rifles and cartridges have been reported to me and I have described them to you in the enclosure. tfhen you have completed the purchase you should place the arms in cases and fetore them in swfe custody at a trustworthy place.

J4th February 1911 Shaikh Mubarak el Subah, Huler of Koweit, Oolonel P.Z.Cox, British Hesident and Consul General, Bushire• A.C. I beg to state that as directed by you my dependant, Haji Najaf visited me and informed me of your orders. I shall God willing be compliant with your orders and obedient to your will in all circumstances, it is only necessary for me to re present my requirements to you and the command will then rest with you. On the 17th Muharram 1329, I represented to you the matters leading to my needs for arras and ammunition and I beg no.v to furnish you with further particulars in detail with a view to removing the difficulties (existing) for the Govern ment . (l) J\oweit is the wharf of Nejd and its trade consists of im ports and exports, the former being by the sea and the latter by the land. As to the sea, trade is safeguarded by the pro tection of the High Government, but as regards safeguard by land this is not undertaken by any of the Powers and is violated by the Bedouins who molest the merchants and the travellers. And as the commercial interests of ^oweit are bound up with the tiejaz-Nejd and the Southern (Nejd) as well as with the North, I have been compelled always to keep an ample force on the lahd for keeping order under the command of my sons. Every six months I change two of them (in the station). For the last Ij- years certain damages were done to my overland trade by the encroach ments made by Saadun-el-Mansoor and this (fact) obliged me to enhance my land forces and I stationed three thousand men who werewere previously with his brothers. Whereas all my tribesmen and townspeople ar3 soldiers I am bound to arms them, except in the case of the wealthy people of the town and the deserts who will have to supply their own arms. 2. The boys who leave the schools every year are from 800 to 1000 or 1200 in number and I am likewise bound to arm them and to enter them in the Military force. (3). Before this, arms and ammunition could be procured by sale and I used to satisfy my requirements locally. On seeing the pressure used by the Government in preventing the arms traffic, I arranged in order to obtain the satisfaction of the Government to prevent the importation of arms into my town and prohibited their sale, owing to my confidence in the belief that the Govern ment had a desire for the satisfaction of my requirements and the protection of my country and (owing) to their confidence in my sincerity and friendliness and obedience to their commands without relying upon anyone besides them and (also owing) to the fact that they would issue orders permitting the supply of such arms and ammunition as I may desire for arming my soldiers and tribesmen and the boys who leave the schools. As to the arms for which I received your permission, I have armed ipy . soldiers with them and they did not suffice to meet a part of my requirmments and 1 was obliged to use the arms which were seized by me from the French vessel. Notwithstanding this, I am still in need of two thousand Martini rifles and five hundred five-shots Magazines about which I represented to you on the 20th Shawal and the 19th Zilhijjah 1328 and in regard to which I received ycur letter dated 19th Moharrum 1329 wherein you state that you would give instructions to my dependent Haji Nejef to buy two thousand Martini rifles with 200 cartridges for each and five hundred cartridges for each only. As to my desire for one hundred thousand extra cartridges for the 5-shot Magazines and five lakhs extra cartridges for the Martinis, you had stated that this would be difficult for the Government unless I explain the reason of the requirement. In order to re move the difficulty I represented to you in my letter dated 17th Muharrum! Muharrum 1329 and beg now to repeat that firotly my soldiers are dninstructed, not to speak of my barbarous tribesmen who do not nare to preserve cartridges for the time of need des pite my pressure upon them to preserve the cartridges. I always send an investigation to them and he finds that every twenty cartridges are short by eight or six and that they have spent them while giving re-inforcement and hunting animals such as gazelles, rabbits and foxes and birds and in their merriment, festivals and marriages. These reasons lead to the necessity for my asking for more cartridges. Whereas the cartridges which arrived here previously with your permission have been distributed by me among my soldiers and tribesmen, there remains nothing in reserve at the godowns except six boxes containing nine thousand. And as trade cannot be pro tected except by forces for protecting it by land and as no forces can be organised except by the existence of arms and ammunition, it is for this reason that I have been obliged to repeat my hope for permission to be issued for extra cartrid ges. I have also one hundred and fifty thousand cartridges which were left at Muscat by my late Agent, Ismail bin Mohamed Rafi, and I likewise trust that you will grant permission for them to be shipped by my dependant Najef with those which have already been permitted by you. Owing to my pressing needs for arms and ammunition, I hope that you will obtain orders at an early date for theie shipment as soon as possible without their being detained at Muscat for a year. I pledge myself to the Government that none of the arms will be passed over except to my subjects, soldiers and tribesmen and that none of them will be sold and that this quantity of arms and ammunition desired will, if no expeditions are made, be sufficient for the period of one year. The question of their being sufficient or not depends or not depends on exigencies which will not arise, God willing. These reasons lead to the requirements which I have fully represented to you. At any rate the command will rest with you and may you remain preserved.DRA^T—(For Approval). S 638— Agency Political X&amp;WWfzy/PMMW/WW.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No. C-9 dated 15th February and to Shaikh Mubarak’s letter of 14th February enclosed therewith of which I attach a translation. £• You left for the interior a few days after its despatch, and by the time it reached here I had gone on tour. Meanwhile (in the course of it) I had brought to my notice the very hostile newspaper articles of which I attach copies. (Enclosure to Mohammerah Consulate No. 176 dated 2£nd February 1911). With these articles before them and also the recent reports cu from the Navy and the Political Agent Muscat showing thajf brisk smuggling traffic has lately been re-started by Koweit boats and subjects from Muscat, it must be obvious to the Shaikh that the present juncture is most unsuitable for his representations for the accord of facilities for importing a further large quantity of arms, and I fear that his doing so would certainly be mis understood and create a bad impression. I therefore write to ask you to read him such extracts from these articles regarding the alleged import of arms through Koweit, and explain that while the misrepresentations and motive of the writer are well known to us, they do not fail to leave some evil impression in the public mind, and I very much hope that the tone of them will make him realise the good grounds which existed for the advice already given to him and will induce him to withdraw' for the present his application for importing more arms and in lieu thereof——thereof to accept the advice of the Admiral and myself and leave any that he may have already purchased,in Muscat^for some time to come. I cannot of course refuse to send on his representations if hecontinues to press it, but I feel sure what the result will be and strongly advise Shaikh Mubarak to give up his intention.

Cox, ^C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of an article which appeared in the newspaper Junub, dated 24th December 1910, regarding the affairs of Arabistan, and which is supposed to have emanated from a Mohammerah correspondent. The Shaikh is taking steps to find out if he can who is responsible for it. TRANSLATION. (Accuracy not guaranteed.) Extract from the newspaper Junub, dated Tehran, the 2Ul Zil-IIadj 1328, No. 1. (To the Editor) If you want news of this side, thank God, everything is in order. The only thing to be considered is that, owing to the lack of protection and troubles consequent thereon, the people find no other way out of it but to become British subjects. From the month of Bajab one thousand and odd Arabs have taken their “Tazakarah” (passport or registration certificate) from the British Consul. A few applications from those who have become British subjects have reached the Consul, saying that though they have become British subjects they have no certain means of protection and therefore, solicited some assurance on the subject. Many of those who have turned British subjects or serve the British, Musalmans or non-Musalmans, openly induce other men to become British subjects. Men also for their own comfort try to obtain “ tazakarahs ” for them selves in numbers. Of these, Meshedy Ahmed, Peshkar (Nazir) of Haji Bais-ut-Tujjar has paid Us. 500 to obtain British certificate, but yet he has not been accepted. He got a reply that 80 men should at one time apply for the “ tazakarah ” when they will get the document. He is now trying to pay Rs. 1,000. Those who have obtained the “ tazakarahs ” are endeavouring to create trouble. It is possible that they must have received instructions accordingly (from the British). One of the instances that would have led to trouble was the keeping open of their shops on the day of death of Hazrat Amir (Ali). The “ Hukumat ” (Deputy Governor) sent his men to tell those who had opened their shops to cease their work on that day, lest it should lead to trouble but they sent back the “ Hukumat’s ” men with abuse, and beat one of them. Of those who induce people to become British subjects are Hussein Jamadar and Yusuf. First of those who became British subjects and sold the name and respect of their children were the above two men, though their elders were all in the 3019 P. D.2 / service of the &lt;£ Hukumat,” and they earned their bread in the Persian land. Because Hussein Jamadar was in the service of the “ Hukumat ” he had the chance of thinking himself over all. This “ Nimak-baharam ” (dishonest man) whose flesh and bones have received their sustenance from Persia has only for the sake of his own freedom gone to “ kafirs ” (those who have no religion) and become their slave, though he was for a great time Deputy Governor at Bander Buzieh, Mashur and Ilindijan. This Hussein Jamadar openly in the town and among Arabs and their Shaikhs induces people to his aim. On the 26th Bamazan in (Mohammerah town) Bazaar he paid a visit to son of Haii Arak Khan m the shop of Khudadad clothseller. He said to the youth, “ Your father has under him 4,000 Tufangchis and why should you be such a * Baighairat ’ (shameless creature). With this pomp and money why should you pay 90 per cent, on dates etcetera, and whv should you fear a black (ne^ro) Ghulam of the Sardar (Shaikh of Mohammerah) when you see him Come you and your followers, let us go to the British Consul and I will obtain for you ‘ tazakarah ’ as British subject. Then you will have to pay taxes 10 per cent, and not 90 per cent. When this is done the Sardar (Aria) will fear you and not you the Sardar.” The youth replied that he reared he might not be accepted or that the matter might not be approved otherwise that he was much obliged so that he might be freed from unbearable trouble. Hussein Jamadar said, “ Why should you not he accepted ? Do you not know that a few of your own tribe went to the Consulate and under false name of Bahreinis obtained the ' tazakarah. ’ Let us go to the Consu! and do you bring with you the names of people of your tribe, and say to the Consul that as he has freed many of your tribe from trouble he nught do the same m your case and that of the remaining of your tribe and that you will pay everything on account of telegrams etcetera for the purpose. I will take the c tazakarahs ’ for youi: you should be at ease. This change is very good for you especially, because Abadan is now the property of the British and you also are a resident of Abadan Island.” J Now the Oil Company, in accordance with a political object, is continuously bringing Indians and Europeans into Arabistan under the pretext that they arc employes. They have also an establishment in the Shatt (River) of Ralimanshir. , 8 soon as they get permission to bring steamers in the River then everything is finished. The Agents and Ministers (of Persia) should be delighted to see this because they will have rest then.

From— Captain L. B. Haworth, I.A., His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, copies of despatches, dated 28th December 1910 and 6th January 1911, respectively, and accompaniments from the Embassy, Constantinople, to His Majesty’s Conshl, Basrah, respecting the policy of the Committee of Union and Progress with regard to Mesopotamia. A copy has also been sent direct to the Political Agent, Kuwait. Translation of apart of an article on Basrah by Ismail Hakkt, Deputy for Baghdad, which appeared in the Tanin of 26th December 1910/ In these parts there is no place so unhealthy and at the same time so important both commercially and politically as Basrah. Whatever may be said to the contrary, the political balance of Irak has shifted to Basrah during the last thirty years. At Ashar the first thing that strikes the eye is five or six fairly big steamers, but all fly the English flag. At whatever part of Basrah you look, a thousand different things connected with England will immediately strike your attention, and you will feel how deep the claws of English influence have sunk into our country’s flesh. The very hammals (street porters) adapt to their own dialect the naval and other technical terms which have been arabi- cised from the English, and decline and conjugate them. (Through?) Though Shaikh Khazal, who holds sway in the part of Persia which extends from Kuwait and Mohammerah to the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, England is practically squeezing the sandjak of Basrah with a hand of iron, and by exercising an unceasing pressure, she is striving to catch it in a fowler’s net. To such an extent (according to a rumour which I have not been able to thoroughly examine) that she has even begun to confer British nationality or protection upon tribes both in the Mohammerah district at Ibade {sic.) for instance and in the Basrah district. As her influence is stronger in Persian territory, the rumour is of more weight for that paid;. In either case the harm to the Ottoman empire is evident; for the protected tribes on the further side of the Shatt-el-Arab both can, and continually do, pass over to the Ottoman side and under the encouragement of the protection they have obtained give rise to all sorts of difficulties.

CROW, His Majesty's Consult Basrah.Dated Constantinople, the 6th January 1911, From— George T. Clerk, To—His Majesty's Consul, Basrah. I am directed by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to transmit to you here with copy of a despatch which he has addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Foreign Office No. 15, dated the 4th Januar; 1911, SeCret a r y «f State for foreign Affairs respecting the policy of the Committee of t mon and Progress with regard to Mesopotamia. Mr. Marling requests you to inform His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah of the contents of this despatch. No. 15, dated Constantinople, the 4th January 1911. From—C. Marling, To—The Right Hon'ble Sir E. Gret, etc., etc., etc. I have the honour to enclose translation of two articles recently published in the Tanin by Ismail Hakki Bey, Deputy for Baghdad, giving his views as to the policy Young Turkey should pursue in Mesopotamia. One of Ismail Hakki’s brothers, Hamdi Bey, resides at Baghdad and is one of the leaders of the local branch of the Committee, while a socond brother Hikmet Bey, is on the staff of Beouf Pasha, the Ottoman Commissioner in Egypt He is one of the Committee’s “ experts ” on foreign affairs and their specialist on matters connected with the Arabian peninsular, Egypt, etc. Last year he was at one time the Committee candidate for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs but, perhaps fortunately for Young Turkey, has not yet been appointed to that post. His ideas, as shown in these two articles, are both crude and I violent. He advocates disarmament on the same lines as in Albania, Macedonia j and Syria, thejirevention of arms smuggling by sending Turkish ships to the IPersian GuIFand the “ cutting off;’ of t he poiso nous trade by putting an end once and for all to the seditious existence of Kuwait or by at leasfT ’Blockadin' it by land and sea. ” The first of the latter two alternatives would seem to mean that Turkey should militarily occupy Kuwait by a coup de main. Ismail Hakki Bey and his friends are no doubt animated by the best of intentions but past experience of Albania, Macedonia, and the Hauran leads us to expect they will act with haste, rigour and violence. The inevitable result will be a disaffected Arab population and, as it is w r ell to lay the blame anywhere except in the proper place, that is, the wrong policy of the Committee of Union and Progress, their disaffection is to be set down to English intrigues and machinations aimed at transferring the Caliphate to some Arab centre under British influence. ' The Committee imitating the French revolution in its hunting down and destruction of aristocrats, evidently intends meting out a similar treatment to the Arab Shaikhs. Ismail Hakki Bey would “ punish the principal Shaikhs on the spot ” probably by court martialling and hanging some of them, would exile m virtue of the arbitrary decisions of secret courts-martial, the bulk of the Shaikhs of the second degree, and would reduce the small Shaikhs to the position of headman and the tribesmen to that of Egyptian fellaheen. By applying the military steamroller he would complete the levelling down process within a year, so as to defeat the fell designs of foreigners, who have interests m Mesopotamia and are looking on it “ with hungry eyes. ” Ismail Hakki Bey further talks of the “ Political meaning impossible to conceal in the importation into Arak of s o many ' arms of Engl ish manulaciure rr bill ^eniently ignores' thS fhe drs^ributing centres arTJrhutran^Tiias'kat rather than Kuwait, that England has gone to enormous trouble and expenditure to stop the arms traffic and that she even risked a conflict with France in her attempt to check arms running at Maskat, while he has evidently little notion of the extreme difficulty of preventing smuggling along the El Hassa coast line not to mention the Shatt-el-Arab, Khor Abdullah, etc. The frequent mentions of “English, Englishmen and English arms” are calculated to poison the minds of the Turkish public and to convey the impression of Great Britain’s hostile designs on Mesopotamia. He is evidently desirous of focussing public attention on Kuwait and Mohammerah. His account of, and the inferences he draw's from, the encounter between the forces of Shaikh Mubarak and Sadun5 Pasha may he described as fantastic. That the result of his propaganda on the subject of Kuwait has been effective is shown by the Grand Vizir’s remarks on that question to Sir Henry Babington Smith and there seems little doubt that he and his committee friends intend creating a “ Kuwait question. ” Hakki Pasha’s remark that “ articles in the press must not betaken too seriously ” cannot itself be taken too seriously. For Ismail Hakki Bey’s articles have been published witli the consent and approval of Hussein Jahid Bey, Djavid Bey, • Minister of Finance and other such, whose influence under a Committee Government is greater than that of the Grand Vizir. Ismail Hakki Bey’s remarks about Mohammerah are interesting and instructive as shewing the Committee point of view in such matters. He would induce Young Persia to allow Young Turkey to despatch troops to punish and “ level ” Shaikh Khazal, the “ rebel against Persia. ” The value of his assur ance that the Turkish Troops would not remain at Mohammerah may be guaged by the prolonged stay of the Ottoman forces that years ago occupied Passova and other districts in the neighbourhood of Urumia. His plan of “ extirpating all the Shaikh’s interests ” in the Basrah region of seizing his property and repressing his agents with the greatest severity, while Persia will not protest and England cannot, opens up a very unpleasant vista of rather serious friction between us and the committee Government of Young Turkey. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Baghdad and Basrah, with instructions to the latter to inform His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah of its contents. I have, etc., C. MARLING. Inclosure in Mr. Marling's despatch to Foreign Office No. 15 of 4th January 1910. The Tanin of Decemher 24th contains a long article by Ismail Hakki Deputy for Baghdad, on the “ Causes of Unrest in Irak.” After speaking of the manner in which that part of the Empire was neglected for centuries, and of the venality of the officials whose sole aim was to fill their own pockets, he continues. It was not only through the weakness of the army and the confusion prevailing in the Government that the tribes became so daring. AChe uninterrupted importation of arms from Kuwait reinforced them and increased their boldness. The erroneous, self-seeking policy adopted by most of the “TalisVif Basrah under the old regime not only caused a blaze in Irak, but also set fire to the Kuwait question, which tends to disturb even our foreign relations, and the terrible effects of which have increased daily during the last seven or eight years. The first thing to do is to strengthen the army, a step wffiich is now being taken. Not only must the VI Army corps be kept there permanently, but we ought also to send there a well organised punitive force. Again, as all the brigands have gathered along the hanks of the rivers it is essential that armoured gunboats should be sent, both to keep order on the rivers and to transport troops. For a long time our expeditions have attacked loyal tribes, while brigands have been allowed to return to their tribes. Justice and policy demand that punishment should be meted out to the real offenders; for innocent tribes, seeing they are punished anyhow, take to brigandage when opportunity offers. Arms must be collected and the arms traffic stopped ; but this policy must be applied to all the tribes, or its effect will be nil. Many of the tribes are 3019 F. D.6 willing to give up their arms, if the Government will protect their lives property and rights but as long as their neighbours are armed they are compelled to carry weapons in self-defence. “ To prevent the importation of arms our ships must always be present to stop smuggling in the Gulf of Basrah, and the poisonous trade must be cut off either by putting an end altogether to the rebellious life of 'Kuwait or by at least blockading it by sea and land.” J It goes without saying that as all these measures do not come within the scope of the existing laws, martial law ought to be proclaimed in a few saniaks which are hot beds oi sedition. But let me not be misunderstood. There is no comparison possible between town life and the life of the Bedawin in Irak. The ton n populations are quiet and obedient and can be governed by the ordinary laws, but the tribes are beyond the application of say the Criminal Code. It would be mistaken policy to proclaim martial law unnecessarily in the towns* for it would irritate tlie very people -whose hearts we need to win whereas the town folk are strongly in favour of the severe punishment of the tribes. If there is any opposition to the proposal for military expeditions I would repeat that the present state of affairs cannot go on, In winter Irak is more favourable to military movements than Anatolia, In a year the VI Army corns will be able to carry out its punitive duty but then it will be too late for in that one year there may occur events so terrible that not a century will ’ suffice to obliterate their effects. The moral and economic importance of the Hauran to the Empire cannot be compared with that of Irak. In the first place there is political meaning impossible to conceal in the importation into Irak of so many arms of English manufacture, secondly a continuous influence is exercised from the Persian Gulf to Irak by way of the Tigris and Euphrates. It is true that there is freedom of trade but let us think of the political effects for people, who are watching- then opportunity of attacks made on the life and property of a friendlv Government m the course of freedom of trade. A few months ago an EiWish engineer travelling by way of the Tigris to Hindie was stopped by a brigand’and ordered to pay toll He had nothing less than a Turkish lira and the' bri°“ind had no change but the latter- honest fellow-gave the Englishman thirty or foity bullets as change with the advice that they should be shown to Nazim Now it may bo that not every Englishman or every engineer nnssin' tint way will be as well acquainted with the local custom 'Perhaps he will sn‘v “ what is this toll ? I shan’t pay ” and will eventually “ eat ” a bullet I Z not wish to speak here of the diplomatic difficulties which might arise from the difficulty experienced in punishing the murderer. As to the financial side of the question let me only sav that, however much the expedition costs, it will, if successful, pay for itself many times over in regular payment of taxes, etc. In order that the punishments may have proper effect the measures taken must be fixed and adapted to individuals. With regard to the Shaikhs who are as influential as princes or as an Indian Bajah, when the worst have been punished on the spot, the minor offenders, when their past crimes have been brought to light by courts martial, might perhaps be sent with honour to one of the islands m the Mediterranean. Shaikhs of the second de'rec nZht receive a lighter punishment; for instance it should suffice to prevent their returning to Irak for a certain length of time. As to the small Shaikhs thev will naturally sink to the level of a small Government official, to that of a moukhtar. I he tribes are accustomed to rally round great names and every Shaikh of note is the centre of attraction. Now this attraction must be broken for tile sake of the salvation of the Empire. There used to be tribes and Shaikhs in Egypt; now there are only fellahin. In Irak too we must nut an end to the present system and leave only fellahin. 1 If the policy pursued by the old rdgime is continued rest assured that we shall lose Irak which is m a worse state than the Yemen, for foreigner who have interests there are looking on Irak with hungry eyes. 6 w 0 i &lt; s. 1 i ] f s t t c ( 3The following is a very slightly abridged translation of an article by Ismail IIakki, Depufy foi Baghdad, which appeared in the Tunin of 28th December 1910. The Political Importance op Base ah, Kuwait and Mohammerah. At present there is no order in Basrah, in the sense in which a civilised person understands the word “ order.” The state of affairs which had gone on lor years lias been changed for a few months by the zeal of the strong hand of discipline,^ but if the administration of Basrah goes on as at present, and if a few wasps’ nests which surround the neighbourhood and are extending their poisonous inlluence to Basrah itself, are not completely destroyed, the brigand age in and around the town will continue until stopped by the firm and ruth less hand of a foreigner. I he few months of discipline and order which we have spoken of with praise and thank fulness are only a temporary and superficial expedient against a chronic disease. If we seek the seat of the trouble which will destroy Basrah, we shall lind it limited chiefly to two spots — Kuwait and Mohammerah. There is no writer on international law r who could define the political position of Kuwait. Officially it is a Gaza and the Shaikh, Mubarak es Sabah, bears a purely Ottoman title—that of Pasha, and at present he flies the Ottoman flag as a sign of allegiance, but there is nevertheless a doubt as to his position in practice. Until seven or eight years ago Kuw r ait had been Ottoman without doubt or fraud : hut pressure was brought to hear upon it by a covetous Commandant and it took refuge with the English, and the correspondence with the Sublime Porte—for what reason we know not—carried ou with England gave rise to an embarrassing situation. Now Kuw r ait from our point of view is Ottoman territory without doubt, hut in consequence of that corrrespondence the Ottoman troops who w T ere intended to inflict the necessary punishment did not enter Kuwait, and the question of letting troops enter it remained in abeyance. Einally, Mubarek es Sabah and his subjects being Sunnis, he is in a position which w ould not allow him to fly the British flag even if he wanted to do so. He lives in a constant state of fear, owing to the fact that he killed his brother and usurped the position of Shaikh. The Shaikh has a good deal of property, a large part of which is in the sandjak of Basrah and this gives the Ottoman Government a powerful weapon to bring pressure to bear on him whenever necessary in order to get its words harkened to and its objects fulfilled. Having realised this the Shaikh recently evinced the loyal desire to take out certificates of Ottoman nationality for himself and his sons ; hut owing to his own fickleness and to the encouragement of the British Consul at Kuwait he changed his mind and simply made the strange proposal to take out certificates of Ottoman nationality for his daughters. Now as to the influence of Mubarak es Sabah (who has now become a millionaire) upon the internal state of our country. As I have said before the sol e depot of l )ro fl^bit jed | ^ 3 n^ w jy^ |r) H^ B ^ ( Kujmit. Moreover Mubarak: JUasha—as is usual in ignorani coimtri^^iolimis 'a, 1 JofflYe~ faced policy; in order to show loyalty to England also he is not content with merely importing rifles and cartridges into the country, but with the object of showing that he is cajiable by himself of chastising all the tribes he sets currents flownng towards the interior and kills and robs men of the most important tribes. Last year this man, having collected from all sides a force of four thousand horsemen and more than ten thousand Arabs, attacked Sadun Pasha and his men ; but rumour says that Sadun Pasha, w ith about four thousand men of the Montific and az-Zafir tribes whom he had managed to get together, killed some four thousand of the enemy and put them to flight. It is worth noting that at that very moment an English officer appeared, photographed the slain and took pictures of the battle field. Humour adds that Mubarak subsequently tried to make out to the English that this rout w r as a complete victory but, owing to the evidence of the British officer, the English avoided being deceived (“ responsibility relies on him w ho relates”). On gaining this victory Sadun Pasha and his subjects went as far as Kuwait and wanted to plunder Mubarek’s goods and treasure; but according■ &gt;- 8 to his own account lie gave up the project in order not to involve the Govern ment in political difficulties. Nevertheless the men of Mubarek finding the as-Zaffir tribe alone three or four months ago, revenged themselves by seizing several thousands of their camels and withdrew. The tribes attacked and plundered are gathered under Ottoman allegiance and those who attack them also fly the Ottoman flag. (Whereas a three star Ottoman flag had previously waved over Kuwait, a flag with one star has recently begun to be used. Mubarek used to explain his use of three stars as a sign of 1 his extraordinary affection for Yildiz “a star” and “ Ottomanism. ”) The duty of the Government therefore is to take the due of the oppressed from the oppressor and to punish the party which disturb peace and order. As to the attitude of England, we would ask whether it is just that our hands should be tried in the fulfilment of these duties. Even if, to suppose the impossible, Kuwait is not ours, what Government is there which would allow a neighbouring State to bring 16,' 00 troops into her territory and to steal the property of half her subjects ? The English Government has taken up the attitude of preventing us from exercising the right of punishment in our lands : could she wink at such a tax made in her territory or in a neighbouring place ? Kuwait is not English (and God forbid it ever should be) so we cannot ask England to punish the Shaikh. Are these acts of brigandage to remain for ever unpunished ? Is a petty Shaikh to have an authority which not even the greatest Emperors possess in our time ? To protect and defend murder, robbery and plunder ill becomes a civilized, constitutional country like England : so we pass over the matter, attributing it to lack of information on the part of the Central British Government or to the excessive zeal of the local British officials. There is another point. Our tribes who suffer these attacks will try, in Arab fashion, to take their revenge to-morrow or the next day and will surround Kuwait and put pressure upon it. Sadun Pasha told me this himself but added that he had postponed the execution of this project in obedience to the Govern ment’s orders. What diplomatic result will this inevitable and reasonable attack have ? Will the British Foreign Office be able to object if an oppressor not under their protection falls in the process of retaliation into the pit he dug himself ? The Foreign Office ought to think of this now ; it is essential to have recourse to diplomatic means in time in order not to be confronted with a fait accompli. The Mohammerah question is of a quite different nature and form. Here we are in the presence of one who is openly a Persian subject. About 10 years ago the person now called Shaikh Khazal was of no importance, all the power was in the hands of his brother Shaikh Mizal, who, knowing the tyranny and trickery of his brother, did not favour him at all. Angry at this, Khazal took refuge with a slave named Sultan, making himself out' to be in danger and begging to be saved, and Sultan put an end to MizaPs life with a bullet. The dead man’s supporters dispersed and Shaikh Khazal reigned alone. It is curious that, although a murderer cannot inherit from his victim, all the deceased’s lands in Ottoman territory were transferred to the new Shaikh, i.e., to the murderer. It is true that as the murder took place in foreign territory the murderer’s guilt is not legally established in the eyes of the Ottoman Government but the question raises a very subtle point in private in ternational law. Anyhow, since that time this Shaikh has increased his power and influence daily. On the other hand, as he knows in his con science that he is guilty of murder he has rasied the slave Sultan to a position of trust, and is compelled to surround himself with guards. He goes now here without having 40 or 50 armed men with him. His castles and lands in Basrah too are very numerous. During the old regime, and for a while under the new, his representative in Basrah had almost as much influence as an Ambassador. Most of the Yalis became the Shaikh’s faithful friends and as for the officials he gained some with money and some by threats, so that there is not a whisper in Basrah to-day which does not reach Khaz’al’s ears at once. On this account an extraordinary terror reigns in Basrah. No one dares to speak of the Shaikh’s misdeeds in any public place for there are many of the Shaikh’s spies about who carry the news to9 him. And woe to him who has spoken against the Shaikh. For in Basrah the Shaikh has bands of men and very trusted men, to whom he pays 70 or 80 pounds a month and if these men cannot manage to tear the offenders in pieces in the streets at night, they bring about his ruin in a very short time by means of all sorts of calumny, false wit nesses and reports. Against these attacks the Valis themselves are impotent. It is a matter of common knowledge that those who made Basrah a sort of prison for the last Vali were men who were taking revenge on behalf of Shaikh Khazal because the Vali had taken certain measures, not against the Shaikh but against his men ; upon which the Shaikh’s creatures in Basrah laid a thousand different plots and caused a great difference to arise between the military and gendarmarie on one side, and the Vilayet and civil authorities on the other. The political and international position of the Shaikh is gradually taking on another aspect. Recently he went into the interior to punish certain rebellious tribes, and rumour says that he is going to come to blows with a branch of the famous Bakhtiaris. If he wins, his influence will increase still more ; if he is beaten, it is anticipated that great political difficulties will arise, for the British Government has taken the Shaikh—if not officially, at least privately—under its protection. I have seen with my own eyes a private communication from the British Consul at Basrah in which he says : “ as you are aware, from events in Persia, the Shaikh of Mohammerah is under British protection whereas in our eyes Shaikh Khazal and his tribes are Persian subjects and it would naturally be unpermissible for either ourselves or Persia to allow any act or circumstance which might disturb the status quo. It is strongly suspected that if Shaikh Khazal were defeated England would openly declare a protectorate over the Shaikh of Mohammerah and even actually take oyer the policing of the whole of Shiraz and Persian Arabia urging lack of security and danger to her commerce as an excuse. When Russia has established troops in the North of Persia on the pretext of restoring order it will of course be impossible for England to remain with arms folded in the South. As an instance of the increasing favour shewn by England to the Shaikh we may note the fact that last week lie was given the order of the K.C.SI. with the attendant ceremonial and pomp. A Major belonging to the British army was especially sent with this order, and the Shaikh, acting exactly like a Rajah, gave the order a salute of guns. The results of this state of affairs fall on us with a terrible shower. In our opinion none of these acts of protection is official. If once we hear that they are official, we must protest with all our might and prevent them by all possible means. Persia has been divided, it is true, into English and Russian spheres of influence, but both parties have undertaken to safeguard the terri torial integrity of Persia. Now a declaration of protection and an act of interference in the internal order of Persia would be diametrically opposed to the maintenance of its territorial integrity. In the second place the Gulf of Persia and the Shiraz and Hamadan districts were considered as a neutral zone when the division into spheres of influence took place and the effect of the Anglo-Russian agree ment on those parts must be considered nil; so that in acting in that fashion the British Government would be acting contrary to agreement, not only towards Turkey, Persia and the other .powers, but also with regard to Russia. Thirdly, the Anglo-Russian agreement was not confirmed by Persia or any other interested power, and was not communicated, I think, to the Ottoman Government; so that from our point of view it is officially non-existent. Therefore, the question of safeguarding those Ottoman rights which are injured at Mohammerah and of extinguishing the fire of revolt which runs in an unceasing stream from Mohammerah into Ottoman territory is a private matter between the Ottoman and Persian Governments. The Russian Government’s confirmation of the clause in the agreement by which British rights in the Persian Gulf are to be safeguarded cannot affect any third party — cannot therefore bind the Ottoman Government and the safeguarding of British rights cannot possibly mean the trampling under foot of Ottoman rights.• ste P s must Ottoman Government take to punish this Persian neighbour of hers? There are only two alternatives; either for Ottoman troops to go and put out the fire or for us to take such defensive measures that when the fire comes it may not bum our land. This needs official diplomatic negotiations with the Persian Government. That Government ought to consent to our troops going and punishing a man who is a rebel against Persia too, and to our presenting Persia with a quiet, submissive country free from all traces of tyranny and brigandage. We should do this not merely out of friendship or 1 ersia but to ensure our internal peace and order, so we should not expect Persia to be grateful. But /will Persian diplomatists be able to show sufficient patriotic daring as to consent to such &amp; fait accompli? Let them rest assured a our troops have not such habits as not to leave the place they have entered. When we have given our word we will keep it. If this measure, which would probably be exposed to diplomatic difficulties, cannot be carried out, then we must have recourse to the second scheme the* defensive. ^ I irst of all, all the Shaikh’s interests must be extirpated, and as property is a part of life ” his lands, property and goods must be seized and all his men, however high their social position, must be followed up and repressed with the greatest severity. The Persian Government is not so wanting in skill and political knowledge as to complain on behalf of a Shaikh who, from its own point of view, is deserving of punishment: and as for LngJand, she has no official legal standing to warrant her opening her mouth to attack us for repressing the Shaikh’s followers. No attention has ever been paidtyo the communications in the form of “advice” made to us by the ntish Consul on behalf of the Shaikh’s men, and the Consul has been told that such communication rested on no right or authority. On the other hand, in order that our rights of sovereignty should be manifest on the Shatt-el-Arab, and that those men, of whom half belon°* to the Shaikh, should be prevented from flowing over to the Ottoman side of the river there must be no lack of our gunboats and warships both on the Shatt-el-Arab and in the Gulf of Basrah generally. We have to-day many ships which are or no use m Greek waters, but which would play an important role in the Persian Gulf and on the Shatt-el-Arab. If these ships are sent we shall need a dock and a repairing yard for them. It has been seen, then, that the question of the Gulf of Basrah and the as to require that a plan should be drawn up by the civil, military, naval and foreign department officials combined and carried out by them conjointly. We have shown how terrible the danger is. There is not a moment to lose. Rest assured that neglect and indifference may very shortly put quite a different political aspect on Basrah and the surrounding parts. S. G. P. I.—3019 F.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to solicit the views of the Government of India on the subject of the right of the Shaikh of Kuwait to import from Maskat or from Europe such arms and ammunition as he needs for the supply of his own re quirements! and as to the limits of what we can properly and sufely regard as his “ reasonable requirements.” 2. Last autumn, our blockade operations having for some time past made it impossible for him to get arms up from Alaskat in the ordinary wav* Shaikh Mubarak applied for a permit of immunity for the safe conveyance of a consignment from Maskat, in replacement of some 2,000 weapons purloined or surrendered by his Bedouin adherents during their unsuccessful operations against the forces of the Muntafik under Shaikh Saadun, in the previous spring. After consultation with the Political Agent at Kuwait, and being satisfied with the /tetes of the Shaikh's needs,' I requested the Political • Vid* micI *nrM to Besidcncj letter No. 28SO, Agent at Maskat* and the Senior Naval d»ud 2 vth October 1910 , to the Foreign Depart- Officer to arrange for the safe passage of the arms, while taking the necessary precautions to ensure that the Nakhodas of the dhows employed did not smuggle up additional weapons under cover of the immunity granted to the Shaikh. These arms duly reached Shaikh Mubarak, the despatch of the last batch being reported by Major Trevor on 17 th November. 3. Meanwhile the slump in the sale price of rifles at Maskat continued, and Shaikh Mubarak wrote that, owing to the extreme favourableness of the market, he was anxious to bring up further supplies and begged that the permit be extended to cover them. In replying, I impressed upon him the inexpediency of bringing up more at present and thus aflording material to the hostile criticism of his enemies and the accusation that he was trading in arms; but this only drew forth a further appeal. His Excellency the Naval Commander- in-Chief arrived in the north of the Gulf about this time and added his advice to mine, namely, that if Shaikh Mubarak must buy more arms he should keep them in Maskat until next year and not bring them up now: it was not long, however, before the Shaikh renewed his importunities for a permit to bring them up at once. Meanwhile copies of the hostile articles of Ismail Hakkl Bey in the Turkish newspaper “ Tannin ' reached me and on the return of the Political Agent and myself from tour, the former was directed to draw Shaikh Mubarak's attention to these articles,—which specifically accused the Shaikh of making an arms emporium of Kuwait,—and to reiterate my advice to postpone further import: again when I visited Kuwait a few days later with His Excellency Sir Edmond Slade, we once more urged on the Shaikh the advisability of postponing further importation for the present. Ho deferred to our advice, but begged me to represent his point of view to the Government of India in the meanwhile and I expressed my readiness to do so. 4. His position, as he explains it, is as follows :— (i) Kuwait is an emporium for the trade of Central Arabia, both for export from the land side and for import by sea. By sea, trade is happily rendered safe for ail by the dispositions of Pax Britannica; but for the safety of trade by land ho has to make provision; and, for his own good name, to ensure the safetv of merchandise and travellers from molestation by Bedouin within his sphere of influence. To this end he has to maintain himself in a position of armed strength sufficient to enable him to control the routes both from northern and southern Nejd to Kuwait. (ii) He has been put to abnormal trouble and expenditure in men and arms during the last two years by the hostility of the Muntafik and his unsuccessful encounter with them of last spring. j(iii) His Bedouin adherents are hopelessly wasteful of their ammuni- tiun, emptying their rifles at the slightest temptation at birds, hares, or anything else that may give them a mark, and it is impossible to check this habit, from which an enormus wastage of ammunition results. (iv) Every year 1,000 or more hoys of the Kuwait community reach manhood and pass in to the fighting strength of the town and have to be provided witli rifles. (v) Lastly, that whereas previous to our operations he had no difficulty in supplying his wants in emergency from arms retailed by local traders in Kuwait; now, as the result of his loyal co-opera tion with us in forbidding and preventing the export, the local arms trade in his town is altogether stopped and there is not a new rifle to be purchased in the place. For these reasons he has to rely on our allowing him to exercise his right to import what he wants for his own needs and giving him immunity for their passage up the Gulf. 5. He specifically wants to import now, or as soon as we will permit him (and begs that permission may not be long delayed)— 2,000 Martini rifles, 500 Magazine rifles, 1,050,000 Martini cartridges, 300,000 Magazine cartridges, and states that after that, his regular requirements in future will he about 2,000 rifles per annum with a proportionate amount of ammunition. 6. On the one hand, we have to reckon at present with a very hostile Turkish press; the passage of arms up from Maskat covered by a pass from ourselves is not a matter which can be prevented from becoming public; and in our own interests we need to make sure that we are not taken advantage of and the arms imported for disingenuous purposes. On the Shaikh’s behalf it can be said that the reasons which he gives are founded on fact; that ultimately ho has the right, and cannot he prevented from getting what arms he needs ; and that we cannot fairly hinder him from obtaining what he really wants for his own protection ; and finally, that so far as our present experience goes, Shaikh Mubarak’s attitude in the matter of co-operation with us, and in refraining from supporting his own subjects when in the wrong, has been eminently satisfactory. This opinion I know His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief shares. While, therefore, I felt bound to do my utmost to discourage the Shaikh from further imports at present and in any case did not feel justified in authorising them without refer ence to Government; yet I am of opinion that wo should, if possible, allow him to get the arms at present asked for, and that 2,00'J weapons per annum would not be an unreasonable figure to be guided by in future; always provided that Shaikh Mubarak continues, as at present, to act up to his obligations in co-operating with us for the suppression of the contraband traffic. 7. I trust that I have gone into tho matter sufficiently to enable Gov ernment to favour me with their views and instructions.l\ J C j » r 156 No. 12b6, dated Bushire, the 14th (received 22nd) May 1911 (Confidential). p r om Lieutenant- Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, &lt;p 0 The Secretary to the Government of India in tbe Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department telegram* No. S.—311, dated the 13th instant, regarding the • Serial No. 137. Shaikh of Kuwait’s requirements in the direction of arms and ammunition. 2. The Shaikh has generally pledged himself not to let the arms and ammunition, which he gets permission to import, find their way into unauthorised hands. He also expressed verbally, during the recent interview of His Excel lency the Commander-in-Chief and myself with him, his readiness to allow the Political Agent supervisory access to them. That alone would not necessarily regulate the destination of the munitions once they left the warehouse, but I suggest that, if before exportation from Maskat the stocks of the rifles were branded with a special device, which would make them at once identifiable if found outside their legitimate sphere, and if they were issued in Kuwait under arrangements subject to the supervision of our Political Agent, a lairly effective check upon their distribution would be achieved. As regards cartridges, I can only at present suggest that Shaikh Mubarak should be required to produce 75 per cent of the empty cases of those last indented for, each time a fresh indent is presented. 3. I think he could in all probability be got to introduce safeguards on the above lines, but the Government of India will understand that it would e inconvenient for the Political Agent or me to discuss them with him now, it we shall subsequently have to inform him that his indent is considered by the Government of India to be excessive and must be reduced. I therefore recommend that the Government of India _ first decide arbi trarily what thev will consider to be Shaikh Mubarak’s legitimate requirements and that the latter be informed that we will give bim immunity for the passage of those amounts if, in consultation with the Political Agent, he will devise and agree to adopt such safeguards on the above lines as shall appear to the Government of India practical and adequate. 4. I presume that the case of the dhow “ ^ a ^ e ^' e ^'J^ a ^ n K re / e 99 e u your telegram under reply is that reported in my letter No. 7 o I 1 • J 1910. The Shaikh’s attitude has a good deal improved since then and in the recent case concerning a dhow ol the same t Serial No. 98. name, referred to in my telegramf No. 370 of 24th April, it has been quite satisfactory. 5. Wliile I fully realise that we should allow political considerations to influence us as little as possible when dealing with practical issues arising out of the arms traffic problem, I think we need to bear m min a P juncture that the reports in the vernacular papers regarding Sir Edwara urey s alleged repudiation of our obligation to protect K uwait &gt;. in T , the 1 __ our Commons—a report which Shaikh Mubarak produced in Durbar at last meeting and asked me to explain ; our inability to entertain is requ be allowed to present himself at Delhi; and the repent overtures made to him by the German firm—amount to a good deal collectively and ma *e i a for us to humour Shaikh Muharak at the present juncture as ar as u do so without prejudice to other interests.( lA 169 No. 1275, dated Busbire, the 19th (received 29th) May 1911 (Confidential).

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government Kuwait Agency letter No. c.— 29 , dated the 9 th of India, a copy of a letter from Captain May 191L Shakespear forwarding an application from Shaikh Mubarak to import 16,000 cartridges, Mannlicher, 1896, under circumstances explained. 2 . I think he must be allowed to get them, hut as the subject generally is under correspondence it seems advisable to refer to the Government of India first. If they concur in my view I beg that their acquiescence may be telegraphed to me. I am forwarding a copy of this letter and enclosures to the Political Agent, Maskat, and Senior Naval Officer, for information. No. C.—29, dated Kuwait, the 9th May 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. C.—21, dated the 10 th April 1911, I have the honour to submit the following request from Shaikh Mubarak in regard to the ammunition which he was permitted to ship from Maskat during the past year. 2. It appears that amongst the arms shipped as Mauser Magazine rifles and carbines were included what should have been described as “ Mannlicher Magazine Carbines, 1896 pattern ” to the number of thirty. By a mistake the ammunition, at the rate of 400 rounds per weapon, supplied with these carbines turns out to be Mauser ammunition and consequently use less for the Mannlicher weapons. The Shaikh tells me that he only discovered this fact during the last week, after opening out all the ammunition he has when he wished to issue the Mannlicher carbines to his mounted guards. He begs that he may be permitted to import the correct ammunition from Maskat by steamer in order to avoid delay and any chance of native boats attemptting smuggling in excess. The dealer in Maskat from whom the weapons were obtained and who has the correct ammunition is Mirza Hussain Ibn Abdul Baqi, Isfahan!. The Shaikh also said he would like a few thousand rounds in excess of the regulation number sold with these rifles. 3. In the circumstances and as the number of rounds will amount to only 12 , 000 , apart from any excess which you may be inclined to sanction, I have the honour to recommend that the Shaikh’s request may be considered favourably, and that the dealer may be informed that he can ship the ammuni tion by mail-steamer under a pass from the Political Agent, Maskat. JP.S. — 10th May 1911 .—I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter in Arabic which the Shaikh sent to me for forwarding to the Political Agent, Maskat, which relates to the same subject and in which the Shaikh asks defi nitely for 16,000 rounds. I regret the late receipt of the letter does not permit me to furnish a translation before closing the mails. &lt; Translation of a letter from Shaikh Mubarak es Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, to Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Agent, Maskat, dated 11th Jemadi I 1329 = (12th May 1911). After enquiring after your health, let it not be hidden from you that we have previously purchased arms from Maskat, with the permission of the British Government for arming our soldiers and that there were amongst the five shots Mausers thirty carbines while the rest were rifles, and as owing to a2 / mistake all the cartridges shipped were for the rifles and the carbines remained useless without cartridges, we have asked our mutual friend Captain Shakespear, to write to our friend His Honour Colonel Cox, to obtain for us a permission for purchasing twelve thousand cartridges which (usually) accompany the carbines and three thousand and four hundred more, the total being fifteen thousand cartridges. And we have advised our Agent, Mirza Hussain bin Abdul Baqi Nazafi, Isfahan!, to refer to you. Inshallah, the permission has been obtained and you have ordered the purchase to be made as written by Captain Shakespear. The question of shipment depends on your opinion. If you wish to decide whether the shipment should be made by boat or by mail, the latter is prefer able to the former, because the boat-owner may, if he obtained permission, venture to ship others. The mail is therefore more desirable, and your opinion is higher. This is what was to be stated and please continue to furnish me with news of your health and that of the Idadame and accept my assurance of esteem.No. //£ of 1911.

Serial No. 137. dated the 13th instant, regarding the Shaikh of Kuwait’s requirements in the direction of arms and ammunition. 2. The Shaikh has generally pledged himself not to let the arms and ammunition, which he gets permission to import, find their way into unauthorised hands. He also expressed verbally, during the recent interview of His Excel*' lency the Commander-in-Chief and myself with him, his readiness to allow the Political Agent supervisory access to them. That alone would not necessarily regulate the destination of the munitions once they left the warehouse, but I suggest that, if before exportation from Maskat the stocks of the rifles were branded with a special device, which would make them at once identifiable if found outside their legitimate sphere, and it they were issued in Kuwait under arrangements subject to the supervision of our Political Agent, a fairly effective check upon their distribution would be achieved. As regards cartridges, I can only at present suggest that Shaikh Mubarak should be required to produce 75 per cent of the empty cases of those last indented for, each time a fresh indent is presented. 3. I think he could in all probability he got to introduce safeguards on the above lines, but the Government of India will understand that it would be inconvenient for the Political Agent or me to discuss them with him now, if we shall subsequently have to inform him that his indent is considered by the Government of India to be excessive and must be reduced. I therefore recommend that the Government of India first decide arbi trarily what they will consider to be Shaikh Mubarak’s legitimate requirements and that the latter be informed that w'e will give him immunity for the passage of those amounts if, in consultation with the Political Agent, he will devise and agree to adopt such safeguards on the above lines as shall appear to the Government of India practical and adequate. 4*. I presume that the case of the dhow “ Fateh-el-Khair ’’^referred h 1 your telegram under reply is that reported in my letter K o. 129/ of 22nd 1910. The Shaikh’s attitude has a good deal improved since then and in t e recent case concerning a dhow ot the same t Serial No. os. referred to in my telegramf No. 370 of 24th April, it has been quite satisfactory. 5. While I fully realise that we should allow political considerations to influence us as little as possible when dealing with practical issues arising out of the arms traffic problem, I think we need to bear in mind at the present juncture that the reports in the vernacular papers regarding Sir Edwam Grey s alleged repudiation of our obligation to protect Kuwait,^ in the House o Commons—a report which Shaikh Mubarak produced in Durbar at our last meeting and asked me to explain ; our inability to entertain his request o be allowed to present himself at Delhi; and the recent overtures made to im by the German firm—amount to a good deal collectively and make it advisa e for us to humour Shaikh Mubarak at the present juncture as far as we can do so without prejudice to other interests.Telegram - P, From - Foreign, oimla to - He aidant, Buehire imo.G-410 f 1 Dated and received 10th July 1911. Becretary of State concurs in Government of India sanctioning the importation of G,500 rifles and half the amount of ammunition mentioned in paragraph 5 of your letter of April 30th, subject to the Sheikh of ^-oweit con senting to suitable safeguards, terms of which must be submitted for Government’s approval. An undertaking regarding future consignments might hamper Government in negotiations v/ith Turkey, and should not therefore be given. ihe reference is to your letter Ho.1256 of ^ay 14th.No. C.—51, dated Kuwait, the 31st July 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I.'Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In reply to your letter No. 1756, dated the 11th July 19ll, I have the honour to submit the following report after consultation and discussion with Shaikh Mubarak regarding the measures necessary to safeguard the arms, for the importation of which permission may be accorded, from reaching un desirable hands. 2. When I informed the Shaikh of the numbers given in paragraph 2 of your letter, he said he would prefer to substitute Gras rifles and ammunition for the Magazine arms and ammunition there mentioned, having found that these weapons are liable to less deterioration in the hands of his people. I replied that I thought there would be no objection to this course so long as the figures remained the same, and to this the Shaikh assented. 3. After discussing possible safeguards the Shaikh said that all his arms were marked with his own “ wasm ” (family-mark) stamped into the metal of the barrel, and it would be convenient if this could be continued as all past and future arms would then bear the same mark. The mark is a blunt arrow-head with a dot, thus^*. The Shaikh agreed with my suggestion that if arms bearing his mark were found at sea in the hands of persons who could not satisfy His Majesty’s ships-of-war that they held them under the Shaikh’s authority, they should be liable to seizure as stolen property, and conversely those without marks being ipso facto not the Shaikh’s property were therefore contraband and equally liable to seizure. The marking can be done easily enough in Kuwait as the Shaikh possesses the necessary stamps, and the weapon shown to me was quite adequately marked. The Shaikh further said that he maintain ed lists of his own arms showing how they w r ere distributed at present and was prepared to furnish me with a copy of this existing list; he also undertakes that when new arms are received that they shall be forthwith stamped, and any issue made from them shall be intimated to this Agency with details of number and to whom issued; also that the return of arms to store (as, for instance, at the termination of the pearling season) and any transfer from one holder to another shall be notified to this Agency. This procedure will enable this Agency to maintain a more or less complete register of the distribution of arms in Kuwait, and a fair check of their movement. I trust the above system will meet with approval, for I am unable to suggest any better method, whilst that described has the merit of being for the most part spontaneously suggested by the Shaikh. 4j. With regard to the expenditure of ammunition the matter is more difficult. The return of a proportion of the empty cases to which I endeavoured to obtain the Shaikh’s concurrence seems almost impossible. The Shaikh tells me he is prepared to furnish details of issues and return as in the case of arms, for unfired ammunition, but fired cases are generally dropped or thrown away in the excitement of a raid, or display of “ powder-play,” &amp;c , and the return of the remainder is problematical. He avers that he himself is very stringent in the matter of cartridges, issuing them 30 and 40 only at a time and insisting that a second issue shall not be made to a man without adequate explanation of expenditure. Beyond continued stringency of issue and the maintenance of a register of those issues as described above I regret I have no other safeguard to suggest. The return of even a small proportion of the empty cases would be almost as difficult for the Shaikh to enforce as it would be for us to check, apart from producing an undesirable impression that a harassing inquisition was being inaugurated. A considerable amount of the expenditure in ammu nition, specially of *450 Martini-Henry cartridges, is by way of presents to Bedouin who come into Kuwait to pay their respects to the Shaikh. 5. I regret I cannot suggest any method which would give more accurate checks, but I venture to think that the system described will furnish a tolerable idea of the distribution of arms in Kuwait or of their movement thence, and so long as it is certain that these do not find their way across the Persian Gulf and so to our North-West Frontier in India it is a matter of compara tively small moment to us how many are absorbed by the tribes of the interior of Arabia ; it may also be observed that, in the event of our refusing or making the conditions too exacting, the Shaikh would inevitably resort to svstematic smuggling.80 No. 2056, dated Bushire, the 13th (received 21st) August 1911 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department • Serial No. 28 telegram* Ko. S —410, dated 10th July 1911, I have the honour to forward, for No. c.—5i, dated sist July 1911 . favour of consideration, a copy of a com munication received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, reporting the result of his discussion with Shaikh Mubarak of the measures best calculated to supply an effective check upon the subsequent life-history of the arms and ammuni tion imported by the latter with our permission. 2. In my letterf No. 1256 of 14th May, I suggested tlmt the rifles be branded with a special device befo leaving Maskat, and that the arrange ments regulating their issue should be subject to the supervision of the Political Agent. As regards the cartridges, apart from the said supervision of their issue by the Political Agent, I could only suggest our requiring a proportion of empty cases to be returned. f Serial No. 156, Part VIII. Captain Shakespear and Shaikh Mubarak, in modification of the above, contemplate the stamping of the barrels on arrival at Kuwait with the recognis ed mark of the Shaikh. 3. This arrangement would enable the Shaikh to stamp all rifles coming into Kuwait, with or without our permission, and would not(?) provide a check on the numbers used in Kuwait territory. On the other hand, it would be just as efficacious so far as concerns the contraband trade into Persia, because any weapon found in Persia or en route to Persia with the Kuwait mark on it would be ipso facto liable to confiscation. Whether the arms are branded at Maskat or Kuwait seems to make little difference so long as the consignments are supervised by His Majesty’s Ships on their way from Maskat to Kuwait, as they will be. Subject, therefore, to the Government of India’s approval, I think the Kuwait suggestion under this head may stand. 4. The other details for supervision of the issue and storage of rifles are satisfactory, but I think Shaikh Mubarak should be asked to allow the Political Agent to check the munitions with the list at any time he may wish after, say, 24 or 48 hours* notice. 5. The question of the ammunition while no less important is a much less simple one to deal with. ^ The only further suggestion I can make is that we should require the Shaikh in future to order through a British firm, who would be required to have the cartridge cases stamped with the Kuwait mark before exportation. I do not fancy Shaikh Mubarak would object to this course, but it would not be possible to bring it into force in connection with the present consignment. 6. The crux of the position is that Shaikh Mubarak, if he really needs the munitions, will no doubt get them up by land if we do not comply with what he considers his reasonable needs. Six months or a year hence we may be in a stronger position than we are now, both in regard to the arms traffic question and the status of Kuwait, and on the whole, I would advise Government to accept the present proposals (including the right of the Political Agent to check the magazine) and, if necessary, work out a more fully efficacious system before he asks for another consignment. If it is possible for Government to communicate their decision by telegram* I request the favour of that being done.@&gt; Telo^ram - P. From - Foreign, Simla. To - Resident, Bushire.

You are very lively right in supposing that he has done so in the past, but it cannot be deduced from the text of his letter.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign of arras by Shaikh Mubarak. 2. Captain Shakespear in his letter No. C.—68, dated the 4th October 1911, of which I enclose a copy, reported the arrangements finally come to with the Shaikh, but there were one or two points on which I wished to assure myself by reference to Kuwait before sending the papers on to Government. When Captain Shakespear’s reply was received I was much pre-occupied with arrangements for landing the Cavalry and regret that this despatch to Government got overlooked. 3. The arrangement arrived at is not completely satisfactory, but I agree with the Political Agent in thinking that no useful purpose will be achieved by pressing the Shaikh further as to details. The Political Agent, Maskat, has received the necessary instructions for co-operation, but Shaikh Mubarak had not up to the time I left Maskat made any commencement of shipping the arms. Note. —Office copy was signed by Resident. With reference to the correspondence ending with your endorsement No. 2323, dated the 6th September 1911, I have the honour to enclose here with copy and translation of a letter received from Shaikh Mubarak on the subject of the arms required by him together with a list of such arms as are actually at present his property, showing their distribution. 2. The Shaikh’s registers were very ill-kept and confused and the list furnished herewith was the result achieved by some three days’ work on the part of two of his clerks; I trust, therefore, its details will suffice. 3. Shaikh Mubarak informs me that he has not included in the attached list the Magazine arms and ammunition he received under our auspices from Maskat at the end of 1910 and these I calculate to aggregate some 400 weapons with 160,000 rounds of ammunition additional to the figures given by the Shaikh as at present in his ware-house. I believe the figures in the Shaikh’s list to be substantially correct, most of the headmen named being personally known to me as employed by the Shaikh, 4. With regard to the arms for which permission to ship from Maskat is about to be granted the Shaikh has undertaken:— (а) That in the event of their arrival during the Political Agent’s absence, they shall be stored separately and not opened until his return ; (б) that in the event of their being urgently required the Head Clerk of this Agency will be asked to note numbers and quantities himself of those about to be removed ; (c) that the Political Agent may examine the consignment on their arrival or on his return to Head-quarters; (d) that all subsequent issues will be notified to the Political Agent as made. guards proposed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, in connection with the import No. C.—68, dated Kuwait, the 4th October 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W, H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, I o—the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 18 «These safeguards will suffice in my opinion for us to maintain an adequate check oyer the Shaikh’s arms. 5. In amplification of the Shaikh’s letter to me it may be observed that the Shaikh explains the large expenditure of his ammunition by the fact that the arms trade in Kuwait having been strictly prohibited for the past two years, he is compelled to supply the wants of his townspeople and tribesmen from his own stocks, and as he estimates that his people both in the town and outside possess as their own property some 36,000 weapons, the expenditure of ammunition is certainly likely to be heavy. 6. It will be observed that in his letter the Shaikh states definitely for the first time that he recovers the value of arms he supplies to those of his subjects who can afford to pay for them. I am not sure whether this fact was quite realised originally, though it was not to be expected that the Shaikh would play benevolent god-father to all the youths in Kuwait without extracting a quid pro quo. Accordingly in ackowledging the Sltaikh’s letter, I observed, in order to emphasise the necessity for straight-forward dealing that the point was hitherto unknown to us; and, for the same reason, that the progressive increase of his requirements in each letter was liable to give rise to suspicion. I am of opinion that though the Shaikh now fully realises the necessity of being perfectly straight-forward with us in the matter of his requirements, it will not be wise to harass him in too inquisitorial a manner, for he can, and probably then would, take steps to supply himself secretly. 7. I have the honour, therefore, to recommend that permission for ship ment of the consignment sanctioned may now be given effect to, and the Political Agent, Maskat, directed to furnish this office with copies of the passes as issued to the respective dhows.

After compliments .—Let it not be hidden from Your Honour that when arms used to come to these parts my subjects in the town and the tribesmen used to purchase their requirements for arming themselves, but when the Precious Government forbad, and I, in obedience to the order of the Govern ment, prohibited the bringing of weapons to my town either openly or secretly, and now when my subjects, the towns-people and the tribesmen, owing to the continuance of the regard of the Government and its men (representatives) on all have increased their strength in numbers and property, they require more arm s for the arming of their youths who leave school in every year. And as to those capable who can bear the price of a rifle or more and who before the prohibition could buy their requirements now ask from me, I submit their state to the Gevernment and I beg them (the Government) to ease their necessity. It is incumbent on us and all our subjects to use weapons for the safeguarding of our merchandise which goes to Nejd and for our tribesmen and for the protection of our tribesmen for all the tribes, whether people of Nejd or of the north or of the south, all their weapons are firearms and ready in their possession and it is necessary to meet them with the like and so we in these two days have convinced ourselves of their exceeding need in each year and their need allowing for wastage is 3,500 arms and with each gun 400 cartridges of which 500 rifles will come to us and. 3,000 for our people and tribesmen’, who will pay for thepi at the cost price to me and their requirements in car tridges for their old weapons which belong to them themselves and to me, three lakhs of cartridges. Ihese are our requirements and our people’s of weapons and the Government’s regard is the higher (in our estimation), and we are obedient to the Government’s order and its wishes in every circumstance ' You requested me to show you the detail of the weapons which are mv own* According to your request will be found a sheet with the details of the arms which are our our own, 3,600 weapons.

Sir, . v / I have the honour to fopti&amp;Td attached hereto, copy and tiranslation of a letter received by ue yesterday fron fheiidi Sir I,{ubarcuK-us~°ubah explaining his request Tor permission to import a largely increased number oi* arm j and ammunition. 2. The ^heixli’ : letter speaks for itself and I need only observe here that the first questions I put in oon- -versation in regard thereto were enquiries as to why the ^heikh had not already taken advantage of the permission accorded six months ago for 2,5C0 arms and over 6 lakhs of rounds and further how the need for so large a demand had arisen so suddenly* 3. The ~heikh’s replies are, taxing the latter question first, that the tribesmen acknowledging his au- -thority have grown in number, that a recent raid has compelled him to put a properly armed force again into the field, that a large nu ber (as many as a hundred) of new diving boats have been put into commission for the presentpresent pearling season, and that, owing to the faoi- -lity with whioh the southern tribes having aooess to Katar and Katif have been able to am theiaelves, he is compelled in self-defence to am the Kuwait pearl-boats nore heavily than has been ousto.aary hitherto. Fomerly these boats usually carried about 8 to 10 rifles a piece, but for the above reason it has now beco.ie necessary to am one-half their couple cents, whilst the boats carry- -ing the pearl-towashes, who frequently have on board with then over a lakh in either specie or pearlc, re- -quire to have every can fully amed. The ‘''heikh’s letter furnishes the reply to ay first query — that the arcs already accorded pemission are So insufficient as to put hii to a difficulty in distri- -bution. 4 . fo far as I can ascertain the above rep^sons given by the ^heikh are true in the lain :- Owing to the comparative scarcity of ams whioh prohibition of the traffic during the last two and half years has pro- -duced in Kuwait the Hheiidi has been enabled to draw into hi j political sphere as more imediately depeddniit upon him a large number of Bedouin who look to him alone for their weapons and ammunition. The southern tribes core particularly the Ajman, Bani Hafir and Bani Khalid have certainly been able to obtain arms cheaply and easily from Katar and the Al-bu-Ainain's settlement at Qasr-as-^abaih. Consequently the Sheikh*s fear for the safety of the Kuwait pearling boats and their ability to defend themselves with their for cer number of weapons is not unfounded. The Kuwait pearling fleet probably numbers between 700 and 300 boats which means at a very moderate estimate not less than 20,000 to 25,000 men afloat. 5. Taking these oircunstanoes into consideration the gheikh's large figures loie muoh of their startling aspect. At the same time it must be borne in mind that ifIf 5 © if the SheiKh desired he would not have auoh difficulty presuming that the Maval patrols continue blockading the Persiab coast, in importing double or treble the nuuber of ar.a; he uentions in hie letter to ue. .Moreover, for the last two years at least, he has been losing what used to be a very lucrative itei of his custoas revenue. Tak- -ing all these facts into consideration I venture to subnit that unless G-overnaent are prepared to institute a really effective blockade of the Arab coast as well as the Persian which would have to include search of all pearling boats, it is a mistaken policy on our part to alienatfythe good-will of a Ruler, who it must be ad- -mitted has for the last two years met our wishes in the suppression of the arms traffic in no ungenerous spirit. 6. The figures previously given by the ^heikh did not anticipate a ohange in conditions so close to hie domains, a change in fact which has t&amp;r:en place within the last d months, and I confess that when for- -warding his requests last summer I did not foresee the present state of affairs. 7. in conclusion, I would urge that ^heikh Mu- ^ -barak'c request may be accorded such favourbble con- | -sideration as may be possible and beg that I may be furnished with early instructions for a reply to his letter.

I thought it advisable for several reasons to call at Kuwait before returning to bead-quarters, and I discussed this question fully with the Shaikh. Keferricg first to the question of the experiences of the dhows, of which he had complained, I repeated the explanations and expressions of regret author ised by Government and already communicated to him by Captain Shakespear, and informed him that their claims to compensation would go on with my support. lie replied that he had been extremely upset about the matter at tho time as he felt his dignity greatly lowered before his dependants, but was grateful for the action taken and hoped all would go right in future. Subsequently, after discussing the wireless question, we turned to the subject of his application for arms. I found the position to be as described in paragraph 2 of Captain Shakespear’s letter No. 38 C., dated 15th May 1912. He had not yet actually availed himself of the permission granted to him last &gt;' July. The arms were still lying at Maskat, but the fact was that he had reeeived justifiable applications for arms so much in excess of the 2,500 weapons then authorised that to import that amount only would place him in a dilemma as to how to distribute them. He then went into the same details as given in his letter of 14th May asking urgently for authority to import the following :— Por his subjects— (i) Shamlan (a big Pearl-merchant) and his depend ants on the east side of the town ... 1,500 (ii) Nasir-ul-Badr (a big Pearl-merchant) and his dependants on the west side of the town ... 1,500 (iii) For himself, personally ... ... ... 1,000 (iv) For bis tribesmen ••• ••• ••• 2,000 Total ... 6,000 with 400 rounds per (rifle?). I could not get him to abate the indent, but he repeatedly asseverated that the arms were solely for his pearling community and his own requirements, and that we might be absolutely assured that they would not go across the Gulf. He expressed his readiness to postpone bringing them up if we desired, until after 1st September, so that they could come through the Sultan’s special Warehouse ready marked, and reiterated his readiness at all times to mete out the severest punishment to any subject of his smuggling or selling arms out side his territory. 3. It is the fact that, though the indent is a large one, the reasons Shaikh Mubarak advances for the need of the arms are difficult to overcome, and that so long ns they remain in Kuwait territory our interests are not immediately affected. I do not quite sec how we can very well avoid compliance in this case, nor do 1 think it will be politic to do so. I therefore beg respectfully to support the demand on the same terms as last years and to request that, if Government can see their way to give decision by telegraph, they will be pleased to do so.te000 3-10 DRAFT—(For Approval).

He reminds you that the period of delaj' (to the 1 st ^ejt I mean) is nearly up and he wishes sanction to be accorded for the remainder of his arms as soon as to prevent further expenses accruing in Maskat.

I had the honour to receive your esteemed letter, dated the 3rd Zilkadah (=15th October 1912). Your Honour had stated that the inscription on the rifles are (affixed) in accordance with your obligatory command and that the object thereof is to show that they are issued from the warehouse and involves no douht or suspicion. I, your friend and dependent, am firstly obedient to your orders and desires in all circumstances. I only stated this on receipt of the 440 (rifles) that my application was for six thousand, so that I may distribute them amongst the inhabitants and my subjects and tribesmen. I wished to expedite distributing them amongst the inhabitants and to com plete their allotments from the first consignments on which no inscription had been affixed. They (the people) disliked the inscription and I satisfied them that the inscription meant no suspicion. They argued, however, saying “ the arragement was that thine mark and our mark should be affixed ”, and any one who took them used to affix his mark and mine thereon. They asked me therefore to refer to Your Honour, and I agreed to do so with a view to affording them satisfaction. Otherwise I have no doubt that all the orders you issue are calculated (to promote) our interests. Your letter reached me when I was with the brother Shaikh Khazal and I showed him your greetings.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak-bin-Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait I duly received your esteemed letter of 4th October 1912 (=22nd Shawal) acknowledging the intimation of the concurrence of the British Government in your importing 6,000 rifles and 400 rounds per rifle including the 2,500 rifles and 6 lakhs of ammunition for which their concurrence was obtained at the beginning of the year. In giving this decision Government desired me to inform Your Excellency of their appoval of the general correctness of your attitude in matters connec ted with the Arms Traffic : but to explain to you that in view of the largeness of the present indent it would not be possible for them to consider a further one in the near future; and that the present permit is given on that clear understanding. Now as regards the stamping of the arms at Maskat, I hope Captain Shakespeare explanations to you have made matters clear. Rest assured that there is no question of suspicion involved; it is merely a matter of public rules applicable to every one who buys a rifle from Maskat. If I want to buy a rifle from Maskat it must bear the mark and number of the Maskat godown. Clearly the rules at Maskat would be useless if exceptions were made. All such weapons have several marks on them and there is nothing derogatory in their having one more, which is not special but public. So you must free your mind altogether from the idea that this marking at Maskat is intended or considered to be derogatory to any one or originates from suspicion. As I am not sure where you are, I am sending one copy of this to Kuwait and one to Mohammerah, and if you are with our friend Shaikh Khazal please give him my best compliments. I hope this will find you both in the best of health.■ - -N' ?5? rf 1912 Britihh Residency &amp; G^nsnl^te-vaenera. Bnshire 15th N^v 1912 H.E* Sheikh Rlr Mubarak -as-Subah K.O.I.E., Rnler cf Kuwait .

A.O. lour esteemed letter of 2nd Muharrum duly reached me and 1 have underatood all that you wrote. i xiad hoped that my previous letter would have made it clear to you how it waa really impossible for us to arrange for any relaxation, in favour of your consignment of arms, of the universal regulations made by the Goltan of Muscat under our advice whioxi require the warehousing and marking of all arms on arrival. At any rate i assure your honour that it is beyoxid k* my power to accede to your request for per mission for the despatch of 2600 rifles from Muscat without marking. jindeed the Britisn Government have been the more obliged for your cooperation in suppressing the illegal arms traffic, in that they have realized txiat your action involved some loss of revenue to yourself, and as you know they are al- ?/a^s desirous of giving tneir earnest consideration to your reasonable views and requirements; and I am as in duty bound submitting to tnem your request to be allowed to receive arms from Muscat without marking but 1 cannot nelp thinking tnat they will find the request a very difficult one to com ply with, i am also mentioning your desire as an alterna tive to import direct from London. it is not hidden from you that the concurrence of Govern ment in your importation of as many as u000 rifles with am munition was only accorded on tne specific understanding that they were intended solely for the use of your own tribesmen and dependents, and so long as the arms remain in their poss ession according to the intention, 1 cannot see wnat valid objection your subjects can nave to the arms bearing a mark from which txiey cam be identified. As4s it is not within ray power to comply witn your request with out first referring to higner authority, and if your subjects will net accept the arms otnerwise tnan with marks then I think for the present it is of no use for H'aji ftejef to re main longer at Muscat. j. will let you know directly I re ceive a reply from Government.

Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resid' n Persian Gulf, To—The Hon'ble Lieut.-Col. Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 2S95, dated 3rd November, I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the Gov ernment of India, copies of the marginally cited correspondence which has since passed between Sheikh Mubarak and my self, with regard to his desire that the rifles which he has received permission to import from Maskat should be granted immunity from the warehouse mark. 2. It will he seen that the Sheikh returns to the attack pertinaciously. The ostensible reason which he now gives for pressing his request is that, as new patterns of rifles appear, his dependents like to get rid of their old ones, but this is one which can only weigh with us as an additional giound for marking all weapons. Captain Shakespear thinks the real icason is that Sheikh Mubarak cannot, as may be expected, guarantee that no weapon will ever go astray, however good his intentions may be, and fears that should this happen he would be held personally responsible and haA e his personal good faith placed under suspicion. 3. It might be possible to humour him and still serve our own purpose by agreeing to his purchasing direct from England from an approved firm and by our then arranging with the firm in question for the stamping of the weapons with a secret mark which would be known to us but not apparent to the uninitiated ; but I think Sheikh Mubarak will in all probability bow to a reply from Government to the effect that they cannot regard his dependent s objec tions as valid and that as the permit for import was given on the definite under standing that the arms would be supplied bearing the Maskat warehouse mark, they cannot see their way to agree to any other arrangement, and I recommend that such an answer be given. 4. As to his further request for an annual permit for 6,000 weapons, in mv opinion it would be greatly in excess of his legitimate requirements, and the existence of a demand for so many annually would seem to presuppose the existence of a habit for their irregular disposal ; but in reply to his present letter I would be inclined either to ignore this request, or reply that his lequiie- ments would be considered as they arose. I venture to request the favour ot a telegraphic reply. Translation of a letter dated 26th Zilqaadeh IhhO (— 7th Isovenibei 1912), from Sheikh Sir Mubarak es Sabah. K.C.IE., Haler of Koiceit, to Tie at enant-Colonel Sir Tercy Cox, K.C I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments—1 represented to your honour before^ this as regards the arms sanctioned for us by the exalted Government owing to oui pressing need for them, viz, firstly tw r o thousand five hundred, and then three thousand five hundred, to complete six thousand, according to our request. When Your Honour visited our port in the month of Rajah 1330 (= June-July), I represented to you that I used to put my mark on the weapons since former times; that those which I distributed amongst ^ my subjects, the townspeople, are also marked with their brand along with mine ; that those I distributed amongst my subjects, the tribesmen, only bear my mark and that the object in affixing the marks of my subjects, the towns people, is that I take the weapons from them when need arises and return the same to them wffien there is no need and any one can distinguish his w T eapon by his mark because the rifles are all of one pattern. When the consignment of 440 arrived and bore the warehouse inscription, my subjects, the towns-2 people, did not agree to take them over unless they (the rifles) should agree with the previous arrangement and custom, and I represented this to Your Honour and received a good answer. I wished to satisfy them, but they declined and did not agree. I found them frightened by this inscription which was (affixed) on the rifles and they had an argument. I represented their argument to our friend Captain Shakespear and noticed that they (my subjects) were in the right. What is deemed by me, your sincere friend (to be fit), is that facility should be afforded to them in this their trivial requirement and that you may order that the inscription should be dispensed with. Otherwise, I approve all what you see and order (to be fit) because your commands are all good and advisable, and w r e have found them to be so. This is w hat was necessary and it is hoped that your kind attention will endure and that you w ill remain preserved and guarded. No. 252, dated Bushire, the 15th November 1912. From— Lieut.-Col. Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Excellency Sheikh Sir Mubarak es Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Koweit. After Compliments. —I have received your esteemed letter of 26th Zilkhadah (=7th November 1912), in which you further explain the dislike of your subjects to having the Maskat warehouse mark on the rifles imported by Your Excellency for them. I am still unable to see any sense or sound motive in their objections and it seems to me that if they continue to object after receiving from you, their Ruler, the explanations wdiich you received from me and which satisfied you, it is evident that they are not in serious need of the arms. I assure you, my honoured friend, that it is quite impossible for any excep tion to be made in respect of arms now exported with our concurrence from Maskat, and if your subjects are unable to appreciate the importance of the matter and to accept weapons w r ith the Maskat mark, I can only suggest that you should tell them that they can do without them. This is what had to be explained. Translation of a letter dated 2nd Moiharrum 1330 f= 12th December 1912, from Sheikh Sir Mobarak es Subah, K. C.I J3., Chief of Koweit, to Lieu tenant-Colonel Sir Dercy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian\ Gulf. I had the honour to receive your esteemed letter dated the 5th Zilhijjeh 1330=15th November 1912, and wffiat Your Honour had remarked was duly understood by me. I, your sincere friend, am grateful to you for your generosity, and it is necessary for me to adopt two courses, firstly, to obey your orders and (secondly) to obtain your approval. I beg also to represent to Your Honour that when arms used to arrive at our ports in former times, the Customs duty (thereon) amounted to at least one hundred and fifty to one hundred and sixty thousand dollars per annum When you ordered their prohibition in accordance with the wishes of the exalted Government, I effected the prohibition with gratitude in compliance with yopr orders and as your approval is a useful acquisition to me in the present and the future. You have benefited Kow r eit and its inhabitants by your attentions, may God benefit you. And Koweit has to-day been expanded, its population has increased, the wealth of its people has enhanced and its commerce and the enter prise of its inhabitants have been extended. As Your Honour knows, they (the inhabitants) are devoid of agriculture and industry and one class of them is engaged in diving business while another class is occupied in making voyages to India in steamers calling (at Koweit) at fixed times as well as in other steamers. Merchandise arrives in at least one or two steamers every month in addition to the steamers coming in fixed Itimes, and their vessels also bring miscellaneous goods which they use in trade. They take their commodities to Najd from el Qasim to the last point in Najd on the south, and also to the tribesmen under the care of their brothers, their sons and their agents, who send caravans taking considerable quantities of merchandise andbeing accompanied by armed men for tlie protection of their goods, because, as Your Honour is aware, the land route is not safe; and in addition to those sent by the merchants, I also send a force of at least one hundred men mounted on camels and accompanied by trustworthy persons on my behalf for the purpose of strengthening them, protecting their trade and affording them security, because their protection, their care and their welfare cause me delight. The diving vessels are also increasing every year and all my subjects are in the utmost need of weapons. Of this pattern, which we solicited the exalted Government to sanction, viz., the 6,000, I will take only 600, and 2,600 will be distributed amongst my subjects, the townspeople, whilst the rest will be supplied to the tribesmen. As to those who are now hesitating to take over the rifles bearing the inscription and about whom you have remarked that you do not find any proper meaning or motive in their hesitation to accept the inscription, I will (now) explain their motive to Your Honour. They only disagree to any objec tion or suspicion against them, for they are men who behave honestly. They have stated to me and to our friend Captain Shakespear accordingly. Since firearms came into use we have changed three patterns thereof, and whenever a new pattern was introduced, we used to buy it—when arms were free—using the new one and selling the old ones to our townspeople and tribes men. Now, several patterns of arms have come into use, one of them being the one firing give shots like the revolver. A few of this have now made their appearance and we have, according to their desire, imported a few thereof, which are included in the number permitted. They wish to obtain from this pattern if it is obtainable. As regards the arms bearing the inscription, the number we have now received is 857, and they are remaining with me in the Customs and they (the inhabitants) hesitate to take them over. The other we distributed amongst our tribesmen. This is their motive and we have represented it to Your Honour. All are now under your order and if you see fit, in your august opinion, which is the highest, you may grant them 2,600 (rifles) without marks and these which have already been received and which bear marks should remain for me for the sole use of my soldiers. If you do not see any course that there should be no mark on the weapons issued from the warehouse at Maska% and if you permit me to do so, I will be able to order them from London dii ect through my friends, so that they may come either direct to our town or we will arrange for them to come up to the Buoy (on the Shatt-al Arab Bar) and there be discharged into vessels. If Your Honour does not conceive this (to be practicable) we will not go beyond your control and order. We have represented to Your Honour our requirements for arms and in addition to this, we also solicit an annual grant from the good graces of the Government, because, as Your Honour knows, the increase in the population of Koweit, the number of boys leaving schools, the enhanced number of the diving vessels and their extended trade, require number of 6,000 rifles per annum. Now, your servant and my dependent, Haji Najaf, is at Maskat and has withheld purchase owing to the inscription. If Your Honour’s high opinion conceives a course to complete the six thousands without inscription (well and good), otherwise we will advise your servant, Haji Najaf, to hasten to our side, as his detention at Maskat will cause excessive expenses. This is what was necessary to be stated to Your Honour and we beg to hope that your attentions will endure and you will accept my regards and that you will continue to remain preserved and guarded. No. 309, dated 31st December 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sheikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah, K. C. I. E., Ruler of Koweit. After Compliments .—Your esteemed letter of 2nd Muharrum duly reached me and I have understood all that you wrote. I had hoped that my previous letter would have made it clear to you how it was really impossible for us to arrange for any relaxation, in favour of your4 i » consignment of arms, of tlie universal regulations made by the Sultan of Muskai under our advice which require the warehousing and marking of all arms on arrival. At any rate I assure Your Honour that it is beyond my power to accede to your request for permission for the despatch of 2,600 rifles from Maskat without marking. Indeed the British Government have been the more obliged for your co-operation in suppressing the illegal arms traffic, in that they have icalized that your action involved some loss of revenue to yourself, and as you know they * are always desirous of giving their earnest consideration to your reason able views and requirements; and I am as in duty bound submitting to them your request to be allowed to receive arms from Maskat without marking,^ but I cannot help thinking that they will find the request a very difficult one to comply with. I am also mentioning your desire as an alternative to import direct from London. It is not hidden from you that the concurrence of Government in your importation of as many as 6,000 rifles with ammunition was only accorded on the specific understanding that they were intended solely for the use of your own tribesmen and dependents, and so long as the arms remain in their pos session according to the intention, I cannot see what valid objection your subjects can have to the arms bearing a mark from which they can be identified. As it is not within my power to comply with your request without first referring to higher authority, and if your subjects will not accept the arms otherwise than with marks, then I think for the piesent it is of no use for Haji Nejef to remain longer at Maskat. I will let you know directly I receive a reply from Government. May you be preserved and salaam. S. G. P. I. DdbV-Xo. 141 F D.—20-1-13.of 1913.

From— Shaikh Sir Mubarak-es-Sabah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. I had the honour to receive your esteemed communication dated the 21st Moharrum 1331=3^ December 1912. Your Honour had expressed the hope that I will be satisfied wuth the explanations contained in your previous communication dated the 5th Zilhijjah (15th November 1912). I, your dependent, confide in, and abide by, your order ; and it is only necessary for me to represent my requirements and press ing needs. When I have brought these to your august notice, the order will then rest with you and my mind will agree to whatever that you may command. As to my need of weapons for my subjects, the townspeople and the tribes men, it is as I represented to you verbally during your visit to our side in the month of Rajab 1330 (=June-July 1912). I possessed your permission for two thousand and five hundred and I postponed taking advantage of it in view of my'x 2 petition for the completion of the six thousand. No mention of this (warehouse) • Not quite accurate. He aueciBcall, e.oreaeed mark WaS l nade J at that time )* and I Only He specifically expressed his readiness to wait until after ist September and obtain through warehouse. P. Z. Cox. represented to Your Honour my arrange ment in regard to the affixing of my brand on the arms, vis., that those which we distribute amongst our subjects, the townspeople, are marked with their brand as well as mine, and that those which are distributed amongst the tribesmen bear only my mark ; and Your Honour approved this. We have acted upon this arrangement since we have used these weapons, for they do not go abroad and are kept only amongst our subjects, and we seize those which bear the mark and which we find with any one besides our subjects. We trusted that the quantity which you would be good enough to sanction for us will be dealt with according to this arrangement. As I told you (above) it is necessary for me to bring our requirement to your august notice, and if you see fit to concur and to agree (well and good), otherwise I am obedient to your order and approval under any circumstances whatever. As regards our requirements for six thousand weapons per annum, we have already addressed Your Honour on the subject, and it is for you to decide. But as regards that which is intended for trade, I will check it in compliance with your orders and will not consent that it should enter my town at all. Now I submit two courses to Your Honour :— While those who require arms for their use notice that they are available at Qatar and that they are thence brought by the A 1 Bu Ainein whose habitat is adjacent to that of our tribesmen (ranging) from my town to their neighbour hood, he who so desires, will bring 4-5 (weapons) for himself and for his children and relatives ; and they will likewise bring for anyone who orders them. If I check them and seize those (weapons) from them, they will contend, saying **we will not bring them ; but you should bring for us.” I do not wish however, that such articles should enter our town and its environs except with your approval and under your supervision. This is one course, and the second one is this :— Out of the 2,281 weapons which we had already received 857 bore the mark while the rest were unmarked. Those bearing no marks were distributed amongst the subjects, but they are not sufficient for their number. Those bear ing mark have been kept by us in the Customs since their arrival as our subjects do not agree to use them. If you order us to do so, we will return them to Maskat to be sold ; or possibly our brother Shaikh Khazal will, owing to his need for arms, accept them at their price and pay their expense if you permit us to do this. We advised our dependent and your servant, Haji Najaf, to leave Maskat for our side, but a letter was received from him by this mail, stating that with the permission of our friend, Major Knox, he has contracted for twenty-four lakhs and twenty-five thousand cartridges and paid one thousand and five hundred pounds out of the value and that it is necessary for him to remain there for the purpose of making references to the manufacturer and paying the balance of the value. Now it rests with you to order as to whether your said servant should stay there or not. This is what had to be said and we trust that your sincere tinue.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To—His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait. After compliments. Your esteemed letter of 14th Safar ( = 22nd January) has duly reached me. Just before receiving it I had despatched to you my letter No. 41 of 29th January explaining the views of Government and their difficulty in complying with your request.The point is that the marking of the arms is not for any special purpose connected with your honoured self or your dependents but is an item of the general rules in force at Maskat, and to waive the rule for you, would be to give rise to numerous applications from other importers of arms ; it is for this reason that Government find it impossible that His Highness the Sultan should make any exception. I trust that in view of what they expiain, you will now see your way to relinquish your objection to the rifles being marked. As regards Katar and Kasar-es-Subaih, Government are not unmindful of the circumstances, but we are doing what we can in the matter and there seems reason to hope that these sources of illicit supply will soon cease.

From Haji Majaf bin Ghaleb, Muscat. To H.E. Shaikh Mubarak-es-Sabah, Koweit. After compliments and enquiries after his health. In the best of hours, I had the honour to receive your esteemed letter and I was pleased to hear of your well being. I have fully understood what you had remarked espe cially as regards the remainder of your requirement for arms, which you have abandoned for reason of the seal. I have noted this, and in compliance with Your Excellency f s order, this humble has withheld the purchase and the command rests with you. My Lord, one of these days I happened to meet His Honour the Consul, Major Knox, in the Customs and he stated 'it is incumbent upon us to satisfy the requirements of H.E. the Shaikh; and he ordered your humble servant (saying) that I was permitted to purchase wh4t we want from anyone we desired, and afterv/ards he said these words 'Buy from the French factory'. In view of this permission your humble sent a telegram to Paris and purchased from the factory twenty-four lakhs Mauser and Martini cartridges and twenty- five thousand French cartridges on the conditions that they should be shipped in two consignments, the first in the month of Safar and the second in Rabi-el-Avval. I sent them an advance of £ 1500 and I received news from the manufacturer that I should deduct th|s sum from (the value of) the last shipment and that he would draw a bill on me for the first shipment in favour of the French Bank in Bombay, so that I may take the bill-of-lading from humble the latter. I pray that you will order this tamiH servant to/'&gt; • to be supplied with a bill on Bombay, in order that I should meet the prices of the same. On the arrival of the goods, I will act upon your order. This is what was necessary to be stated and may continue to remain preserved.Dated 15th Rabi II 1331. (= 24th March 1913). From Haji Najaf bin Ghaleb, Muscat. To H.E. Shaikh Mubarak-©s-Sabah, Koweit. A.C. I beg to bring to Your Excellency^ notice that I submitted a letter to you before this and that I received no commands from you. May you ever enjoy peace and pros perity. Secondly, I beg to state that 434 cases mauder and martini cartridges arrived for Your Excellency by the German steamer 'Nani' on the 22nd Rabi I (= 1st March) and 350 cases martini cartridges arrived for Your Excel lency by the German steamer 'Persepolis' on the 9th Rabi II (= 18th March) of which 25500 are French cartridges, and that the total number of cartridges which have arrived for Your Excellency by the said steamers is 12,26,000 both fef mauser and martini. All of them have been taken into the Arms Warehouse and a ground-fee of one rupee on every box per mensem is chargeable thereon; while the bill of lading is in my hand. I went to His Honour the Consul and produced the bill oflading to him. The bill of lading is written in my name and is also countersigned by the Bank (in this way) 'please deliver to Najfif bin Ghaleb'. The marks on the boxes are identical with those in the bill of lading and there is absolutely no difference between them. The Consul ordered me to bring him copies of the letters written by me to the manufacturer as well as the statements of account received from the manufacturer and also the letters received from the latter. I obeyed the Consult order and produced to him two statements, copies of tbe lettersletters, the bill of lading and the letters from the manu facturer, I showed all these to His Honour Major Knox who perused them and who told your humble servant ,f all your letters are in order and there is nothing wrong in them and they involve no responsibility”. He told me afterwards M I have referred £our affair to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire”. I will let Your Excellency know ehen a reply is received by the Consul* I hope that Your Excellency will advise His Excellency the Resident to release the cases of cartridges and the affairs are not hidden from Your Excellency and the command rests with you.Dated 29th Rabi II 1331. (7th April 1913). From H.E. Shaikh Mubarak-es-S|ibah Ruler of Koweit. To Colonel Sir Percy Cox, British Resident in the Persian Gulf and H.B.M’s Consul-General, Bushire. A.C. Let it not be hidden from Your Excellency that our dependent Haji Najaf at Muscat, when he wanted to negotiate for the quantity of cartridges required by us, referred to our friend Major Knox and mentioned to him the factory with the owner 6f which he wanted to negotiate. He (Major Knox) permitted him according to Haji Najaf’s letter to us, and we duly represented (the facts) to your Excellency in our letter dated the 14th Safar 1331 (= 22nd January 1913). Now, there have arrived two consignments of cartridges consisting of 784 cases containing twelve lakhs and twenty- six thousand Mauser and Martini cartridges, and these have been deposited in the Arms warehouse at Muscat and it is demanded that one rupee on every case should be paid per mensem. (We would not have ordered these) if we had not firstly referred to Your Excellency about our require ment for arms and ammunition - for the latter of which our need is greater. Our said dependant had also referred to our friend Major Knox who permitted him, otherwise we would do absolutely nothing contrary to your consent. Now what we did not expect will happen to us. When the said cart ridges arrived there, our dependant had a place where to deposit them pending the issue of the permit, without any expenses being sustained by him - though according to what he says our dependant did not import them for us except wi thm Copy of a letter No# 156 dated 15th April 1913 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Sheikh Sir Mubarak es Subah, Ruler of Koweit. I have duly received your esteemed letter dated 29th Rabi II and understood what you wrote# It is as your servant Najaf informed you, Major Knox referred the difficulty to me and I had to refer it to Government,and I am glad to inform Your Excellency that they have not failed to be mindful of your interests and have ordered that our friend H#K. Syed Faisal be advised to release your consignments. What happened was this;- Haji Najaf was careful to give explicit instructions as to how the goods were to be addressed and despatched, but nevertheless the manufactur ers seem to have wilfully sent them out in a way which contravened the published the rules and made the goods liable to confiscation. But alhamdulilah the evil designs of the mischief- makers are defeated and the matter |s arranged.

In amplification of my telegram No. 7l7j dated the 19th (20th ?) June 1914, I have the honour to inform you that the Political Agent, Kuwait, whom I consulted as soon as possible on the question of the Arabic blunder reported in my letter No. 1734), dated the 7th June 1914, replies that in his Arabic copy of Sir P. Cox’s letter under discussion, between the words the following words occur : 2. These words alter the whole meaning of the passage and undoubtedly imply that the earlier quantity sanctioned are included in the later sanction conveyed by the letter. 3 . The mistake, therefore, would appear to have occurred in the preparation of the office copy of the letter and may be confined thereto ; it is probable that Shaikh Sir Mubarak’s original letter is identical with the copy in the possession of the Political Agent, Kuwait. 4. In any case, it would be awkward now to call for Shaikh Sir Mubarak’s copy for purposes of verification, and I have the honour to suggest that I may be directed to inform Shaikh Sir Mubarak that the later sanction of Govern- ment, which included the earlier sanction, was confined to 6,000 rifles and 24 lakhs of ammunition ; that these have already been imported by him ; that his agent at Maskat was clearly informed by the then Political Agent, Maskat, of the quantities he was allowed to import under the permit; that some misunder standing appears to have arisen and that 379,440 rounds have been ordered in excess and are now in the Arms Warehouse, Maskat; that, in order that the Shaikh may not be put to loss in the matter, the Government of India are pleased to condone the excess and allow its import into Kuwait but only on the understanding that no further indents can be considered in the near future.1 ^ ‘v ^ s- . - - OONFIDK^TIAL .
