In connection with the latter I would refer you to the last enclosure namely D,Q,M61/46l/91 , dated W » / 72/3/33 Baghdad the 11th January 1933 from Sir Francis Humphreys to G*W*Rendel, lsq.,C.M.G., of the Foreign Office* 3. In the last five lines on page 1 of this let ter Sir Francis Humphreys writes as follows 'The Director of Customs recently told me that he estimated that more than £60,000 worth of goods had been snuggled into IRAQ, from Kuwait during the past year and that a member of his Staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers'. 4* With the very greatest diffidence and with all respect I venture to suggest that the Director of Customs is under a misapprehension both as regards (a) the value of goods smuggled from Kuwait into IRAQ; and (h) as regarding the story that a member of his staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers, and I think I should be lacking in my duty were I not to endeavour to correct &amp;he statement* 5* As regards (a) above: I have throughout 1932 and in the three previous years that I have been in Kuwait, taken a special interest in this question of alleged ’aauggling’ into IRAQ, and have over and overover again visited the Kuwait-IRAQ frontier along its whole western and northern length and especially in the vicinity of Safwan and Jabal Sanauu I have fur ther discussed the matter, on many^ occasi ons, with dozens of ohaikhs anc tribesmen, both liUbl and Kuwaiti and all evidence that I have been able to gather has I'coJLhZ to show that very little smuggling indeed gees on the land side. Indeed that which does go on is confined almost entirely to the IRAQ Uuntafik shepherd tribes who annually move into Kuwait terriTory for 5 months during the /inter ana opring. rven this cannot be clas sed as smuggling proper seeing that ail it amounts to is the conveying bad: with them,to their homes in IRAQ, by each shepherd family, of small quantities of sugar, coffee ana tea - their needs for the return journey, with a little over for home consumption. That this does not amount to raudh nay be gauged fey the fact that these shepherds are poor and each family has transport barely sufficient to carry its one tent and camp equip age. They have little spare space for contraband. As I have reported on different occasions duringAhe past year, a small amount of contraband traf- / fic does, undoubtedly, find its way e^d to the many vil lages and hamlets on the IRAQ bank of the Shatt al Arab near its mouth; but from evidence that I have been able to collect it would appear that this traffic is carried on mostly by IRAQ nationals who visit Kuwait in small sailing vessels, nRke their purchases, and return hoiiB again. It is, I think, exaggerating the matter a very great deal when the Li rector of Customs says that goods to the value of £60,000 found their way into IRAQ from K'uwait durl ng 1932. If he were to visit mo in Kuwait occasionally,3 occasionally, I Hi ink, I could prove to him by canparing the very high prices that rule in Nejd &amp; Passim with those of IRAQ, that there is little or no financial inducement for contraband runners to work their traffic across the IRAQ border - the big advantage always haand does, lie in running goods to the South. Lastly it may interest His Excellency the Ambassador to know that the total value of imports into Kuwait from all sources in 19 31-32 was only £225,918/-. The figures for 1932 are not available as yet, but as the trade year was the worst that Kuwait has ever yet experienced, it is safe to say that the total imports will not exceed £180,000/- during the current year. It is not, I submit, reasonable to suggest that a third of Kuwait's total import trade is run across the IRAQ Fron tier in the form of contraband, especially when Kuwait herself lias a population of 70,000 souls to provide for. As regards (b): I am afraid, much as I appre ciate the undesirability of doing so, that I must take exception to the misleading statement of the Director of Customs as given to His Excellency the Ambassador regard ing the shooting of one of his staff. This again I do with the utmost diffidence. The incident mentioned is not only quite well known In Kuwait but as soon as I heard about it I started immediate enquiries (secret and otherwise) with a view to getting at the facts. I was guided in this by the fact that the Times of Mesopotamia in one of its issuer accused Kuwaitis of being the culprits. I myself also visited Zubair unofficially and enquired from the Customs and excise authorities as to their version of the business. The net results of my investiga tions showed that the smugglers were men of t be Bani Hacbaim tribe resident near Samawa, 250 miles from Kuwait,4 - Kuwait (one feeing an escape gaol bird). They bad come down, to Kuwait and were taking back several camel loads of contraband matter to Kanawa #ien they were rounded up in IRnQ, territory nearly 80 miles inside the frontier and in the fight that ensued a member of the Customs &amp; Excise staff was killed. To suggest that Kuwaitis were the blockade runners and that a Kuwaiti shot the prevent* tive officer is very far from the truth. 6. while I trust I may be pardoned for passing the above remarks - which indeed I with all res pect - I feel that the above words of explanation are due in justice to Kuwait, as it is generalities which so often give wrong impressions. And I do not wish persons in London to fee prejudiced against the Shaikh of Kuwait.

British Embassy, Bagdad. 51st March, 1933. Sir, The ’Iraqi Government have asked that the co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait should be sought in the institution of preventive measures to combat the extensive smuggling of contraband from Kuwait to ’Iraq. Some details of the nature of the smuggling and of the importance attached to it by the ’Iraqi Government are given in the letter addressed to your Secretary by the Financial Secretary to the High Commissioner, Ho. 7976 of September 30th last. The measures which the ’Iraqi / Government suggest that the Shaikh should take are as follows? / (1) (a) No goods should be allowed to be shipped from V Kuwait to ’Iraq before obtaining a permit for each shipment. This permit, together with the shipping documents (manifests] should be authenticated by an ’Iraqi customs official in Kuwait who should send copies of the permit and the shipping document to the Customs Collector- ate, Basrah, informing them of the quantity of the goods shipped from Kuwait to ’Iraq, so that they may require the importers to produce this quantity. (b) The ’Iraqi Government suggest that the British Political Agent at Kuwait could carry out the duties proposed for the 'Iraqi official mention ed above. /2 (a) The n onourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIHE.(2) (a) That a small steam boat should be placed at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab to watch the movements of boats. (b) That adequate control should be introduced on land. 2. I have the honour to request that these proposals may be laid before the Shaikh of Kuwait and that he may be invited to state if he is willing to co-operate with the ’Iraqi Government in the manner proposed. The question is of some urgency and I should be obliged if the Shaikh could be asked to give it his immediate attention. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant, ( Sgd. ) F. H.

POLITICAL AOmGY KUWAIT From Lt.-Colonel H.P.P.Dickson, C.I.F., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U 3 H I R E &gt; Firing on a Kuwait Dhow by the Fao Customs Launch. letter No.R.2/942, dated the 1st May 1933, together with enclosure, which I have received from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. ) 2. The letter and enclosure speak for themselves. 3. The incident happened on the 23rd of April and the delay in submitting this report has been entirely due to the Shaikh’s laudable desire to make no hasty move, or ask for representations to be made, until after he had sifted all the evidence at his disposal. 4. It is with the greatest regret that I now report this incident to you especially as it comes at a time when the IRAQ authorities are apparently leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to convey the impression that Kuwait is engaged in running n quantIties of contraband” into IRAQ as a regular pastime $ an accusation which we in Kuwait cannot but help thinking has a political origin and in some way or other is mixed up with the organised campaign now being conducted/8./ oonaucted against this Principality (as witness the taxation of the Shaikhs Date gardens, the Faddaghiyeh case and the forcing of the Shaikh to pay export tax on his produce des tined for his omi household use). 5. From my own investigations, which have been conduct ed separately from those of the Shaikh, there is fairly good evidence that the Kuwait Dhow was crossing the mouth. The Khar Abdullah on the direct route for the Shatt al Arab estuary, end had just left behind the old Turkish fort (Al qishla), which is situated on the South East corner of Bubaiyan Island, when it was attacked by the IRAQ Customs Launch whilst still in Kuwait waters. (Vide map Mesopotamia scale 2 miles to inch, sheet Kuwait). 6. Also as far as one can follow the evidence at ones disposal, the IRAQ Customs launch would appear to have 8 crossed over from the IRAQ shore and to have come scme/miles outside its own territorial limits, when it made its rathen Urvtc cruel and heartless attack, which, as you see, hag deprived two homesteads of their breadwinners, and caused two other sailors to he now lying desperately wounded in the m W&amp;tW American Mission Hospital here. nm- if- pfm *mm 7. At the same time I fu. always two sides to every story: certain it is that what there era ever the results of ones investigations here, the IRAQ cus toms people will deny the Kuwait evidence in toto. They always do. The case, therefore, must eventually boil down to the dhow crews word against that of the Police Boat crew. This is the unfortunate part of the whole business as although we shall probably never get at the real truth of this sorry business, the results will be to make for fur ther bitterness and distrust between the people and Govern- fU SUJcA ments of Kuwait and IRAQ, which both and I are always trying to better.8« It has struck me perhaps that the IRAQ, Customs people at Fao (I refer more especially to subordinate officials and constables) do not know that Bubiyan Island belongs to Kuwait, and that the actual boundary line bet ween Kuwait and IRAQ follows the centre line of the Khor Abdulla from a point East of Warba Island ( belonging to Kuwait) to the open sea: I make this suggestion as it was once or twice reported to me and as late as 1952 that on more than one occasion IRAQ Customs Launches have been seen creeping along the Southern shore of Bubiyan Island and once even in the Khor Subiyeh itself. That I did not take the matter up at the time was solely due to lack of proper evidence, 9• It, nevertheless, I think, would be a useful point to make with the IRAQ Covernment, if the question of the exact whereabouts of the Kuwait sea boundary vis a vis the Foo promontory were thcroighly instilled into the minds of the Fao Customs Preventive Officers. Clearly IRAQ has every right to do what she likes within her own terri torial waters, and if she suspects contrabandists to be planning a coup near her shores, no one here can complain against the action she takes, always provided she is within her side of the boundary line. 10# VQiat is so unfortunate, and creats so much bad feeling here is the knowledge that IRAQ Customs Launches do operate outside their own waters, and may easily be tempted to commit acts of piracy, for the sake of the large rewards which are undoubtedly doled out to those successful in bringing in prizes. 11. I am sending you five spare copies of the report, with the request that one be sent to $he Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf if you see no objection to such// to such course I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, be Lt.-Colonel, ^ olitioal Agent, Kuwait•Translation of a letter No.R-2/942 dated the 6th Muharram 1352 (1st May 1933), from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I.,Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait, ——-oOo— After compliments, ^ , ) I am forwarding to Your Excellency a statement made by one Hasan ’Ashoor, regarding the case of a small sailing ship (Balam) which was set upon and attacked near to the western shore of the Khor ’Abdullah, by a motor boat of the Fao Preventive service (Customs) with the result that two of the crew of the Balam were killed out right, and two more were very severely wounded, they (the crewjhaving been fired on by the said motor boat, which, it appears, tried to stop tkw and capture them on the high seas* The surviving members of the crew however seeing this action of the motor boat, became afraid, put about and made for Kuwait* The action of the Pao Director of Customs in such a place (i*e.Kuwait’s own waters) is clearly a plain infringment. If he desires to pursue smugglers, he should do so within his own boundary and punish any smugglers whom he may catch there. But his crossing the three mile limit and hunting down sailing ships in such places (as mentioned above) is a great mistake* Please, therefore, be so good as to submit the case to those concerned, so that there may not be similar occurranees, which are contrary to all law'international. Usual ending* — oOoTranslation of stateioent made to the Director of Cus toms, Kuwa it. 0O0— This is to inform you that I shipped per the Balam of uakhuda ill Ibrahim 10 bags of sugar and 5 bags of tea from Kuwait to Kao, as per manifest Ko.692, dated 25th Dhil Hujjah 1351 (20th April 1933). .men the Balam passed the 'Qishlah' and was just about to cross the lower end of Khor AbdMlfc, a motor boat came up, the crew of which started shouting and ordered it to stop. But when the crew under stood it to be the Fao Customs motor boat, they became afraid of treachery ana began to change their course. This they did because the Director of the Fao Customs has on several previous occasions made it a practice to seize sailing ships, unmistakenly carrying cargo to Fao, under proper manifests from the Kuwait Customs Department, and has destroyed these latter, and takenthe boats to the principal Customs Department pretending that they were smugglers, this in order to get a regard from the Government. In the present case the nakhuda was clearly afraid some such thing was going to happen, because &gt;!he had a mani fest from the Kuwait Customs Department for the cargo which he carried to Fao. The motor boat seeing that the Balam did not stop, when ordered to doso, fired at it. Two persons were killed including the Nakhuda^, and two were wounded. The rest of the crew in great terror and after much difficulty reached Kuwait in their boat. We ha ve made the above report to draw your kind attention to this distressing incident, and to request you to be so good as to submit the case to His 3xcellency the Shaikh. Dated^AthsKuharram 1352.

As the case is in danger of assuming important dimension^, X think you should be made aware of what has been going on, especially as the correspondence throws useful light on the harsh methods of the X^ao Customs authoriuies, where Kuwait boats are concerned. is -excellency the Mutasarrif at Basrah for your information, is authorized, by the Minister of the Interior, to communicate direct with me, in mattersof small import, such as petty frontier tribal cases, etc., and as this one started in a small way he was justified, I think, in addressing me in the first place. 5. Of course the Bhaikh of Kuwait ordered the 3 IRAQ ballams to be seized as a retaliatory measure in the first place, seeing that so many Kuwait dhows have been seized and sold for a mere song during the past year. But think you will agree that such methods are unde— siraole on principle and will only lead to bad 'blood”. 6 * 1 8,0 sanding 3 spare copies of this letter with enclosures, for transmission to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad with the request that further correspondence on this subject had better come through the British 2Xmbassy now.

As you are aware the matter was fully discussed by you with His ^cellency the Shaikh when you were here (on 14.5.33.}. 3. At Ihis discussion you requested the Shaikh to make the following further enquiries from the surviving members of the Dhows crew (3 men) (a) The exact date on which the launch attacked the Kuwait Dhow; (b) The hour when the said attack was pomgiitted- 4. You will see from His Excellency f s dated the 15th May to myself, translation of which I attach that the attack took place on the night of 25th April 1935 at about 8.30 p.m. This makes it necessary for me to cor- ... -1 &lt; I 'V ? rect the date as given by me in my NO.264 of 6th nay para 3, from 33rd April to the 25tt., an error easily \ made when trying to convert Arab into English date. 5. In your conversation with the Shaikh you further asked if the approximate position of the Dhow, when orderedordered to heave to could be ascertained. His Excellency, as you will recollect replied that he had definitely been able to ascertain that the Dhows crew had landed and supped at the old Turkish Fort (Qlshla) situate at the South Fast corner of Dubiyan island, and had afterwards set out for 'ao Bar: Further that the dhow had only proceeded a quar ter of the total distance across the mouth of the Khor Abdulla estuary, when it met the Customs launch. This would make the position of the dhow to be about 3^ to 4 miles east of the Qlshla or South East corner of Bubiyan Island, and well within Kuwait territorial waters. 61 On the assumption that the dhows crew landed and dined at 7 p.m., and continued their voyage at 7.45 p.m., they could not have proceeded more than 4 miles by 8.50 p.m. which would coincide with the evidence of the survivors.

GENERAL. In order to understand the whole contraband ques tion in its proper perspective one must for a start appre ciate tMat of the States bordering on the Persian Gulf we have two distinct groups of States holding diametrically opposite policies in the matters of customs tariffs, (a) Persia » IRAQ, and Saudiyeh . all believers In the theory that the sole object of Tariffs is to increase the Revenue of the state, and to this end instructing their Customs Departments to make their duties as high as possible. (b) Kuwait . Bahrain . Q atar , Debai (including the Truciai Coast generally), all Arab States lying on the Western shore of the Persian Gulf, whose firm belief is that low tariffs will attract trade to their ports to the definite detriment of the high tariff countries mentioned in (a) above. A not unnatural or incorrect assumption, seeing that their chief revenue is derived from their transit trade with the interior, and also the earl Trade* which is almost entirely in their hands. It stands to reason therefore that those countries (b) above in the Persian Gulf possessing such low customs ' ) duties as 4 % ad valorem, are going to get most of the trade whete the necessities of life are concerned, while their in habitants are going to engage themselves in the contraband business with their nei^ibours possessing high tariffs (a) above. A. Jl.s — II.CONTRARAM) TRAFFIC BSTWSjM ARAB STATES IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND PERSIA. (a) The Persian policy in recent years of intro ducing prohibitive tariffs all along her seaboard, has natui ly been taken full advantage of by the states on the Arab side mentioned in paragraph I above, and until the arrival of the new Persian Navy, the running of contraband from the Arab Coast to Persia, was a most easy and lucrative pastime. Those chiefly engaged in the business were the inhabitants of the Trucial Coast with their ingrained love of piracy and adventure (as witness the rise of Debai from a village to a large town in 20 years), although Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait have not be on far behind in i the game. (b) The advent of Persian new navy, and the strenuous efforts \4iich Persia has since made to stop this illicit traffic, have already made themselves felt, and contra bandists working from the Arab side of the Gulf are now looking round for less risky fields for their operations. Not unnaturally they have turned their attention to the next two best countries for making profits, viz ba’udiyeh and IRAQ. Both these states maintain high customs duties as part of their national policy, especially on such things as sugar, tea, piece goods, silks, silver thread etc. etc. (o) The Kingdom of Sa'udiyeh of the two, is the less easy to run contraband into, even though it has a long and desolate coast line, with hundreds of starving Bedouins only too ready to run cargoes into the interior in order to make a little profit. The reasons for this are as follows:- 1. The terror which Bin Bauds harsh and- 3 - and cruel viceroy of Hassa, Ibn Jaloui inspires among the Bedouins. 2 . xhe fact that the tribes of Hassa are almost all at enmity with each other and will invariably give each other away. All know this. (d) 3. The fact that ibn Jaloui employs a small array of 'Murra” trackers to follow up tracks of all caravan/ suspected of moving from the coast into the interior until it is found and can explain its movements. 4* The fact that any Bedouin tribe, which captures a caravan carrying contraband is allowed to take three quarters of the whole cargo caughti The state only requiring the camels, a quarter of the goods, and the culprits. IRAQ, on the other hand, has a small but conveninet- ly sheltered coastline, with many shoals, roundabout the mouth of the Shatt al Arab, and in the northern reaches of the Khor Abdulla, also a long and from the contrabandists point of view, a most tempting desert frontier, several hundred miles in length, with police posts very far apart, and a miserably weak preventive system of car patrols . which can easily be avoided, especially during the great heat of Summer, by determined persons, who know the country with their eyes shut and do all their marches by night. Lastly but not least IRAQ does not go in for the policy, as far as the writer is aware, of getting her Bedouin tribes to cooperate with Government, by a good system of subsidies^ and suitable rewards for catching the contraband runners, with the result that every tribal man’s hand is against his own Government, and well in league with every contraband runner. III.KUWAIT AND CQHTEABAM) RDRNIHG. (a) If we reflect on the fact that there has been a failure of the pearl industry in the Gulf for the last 4 years, and that the King of Sa’udiyeh has done his utmost to restrict trade between Kuwait and the interior of NejdiJejd, by a system of land Blockade extending over a period of 9 years, it is not to be wondered at that Kuwait has, and cioes interest herself, in running contraband goods into her two neighbours territories, Sa’udiyeh and IRAQ, and into Persia when she can. Actually because of the fact that Persia has al ways maintained easily the highest customs tariff of her neighbours (as much as 200 % ad valorem/ on same kinds of goods) , ana the fact that Sa'udiyeh comes next (with an approximately 100 $ tariff on same goods), IRAQ, with her more moderate customs duties, has been and is, the least sinned against, for quite naturally contrabandists make for the country offering the highest returns. (b) As mentioned in paragraph 11(a) above, the ac tivities of the Persian Navy have made it more dangerous than before to run illicit cargoes to Persia. Nevertheless the traffic still exists, for profits are enormous. The business is mostly in the hands of Tangistani tribesmen who sail across from Persia to Kuwait with cargoes of grain, fruit, oat fodder, and 'abbah' cloth. They take back tea and sugar. Those who supply them in Kuwait, are mostly Persian merchants, long domiciled in Kuwait, who have friends and relatives on the other side, who know the ropes. Cargoes are paid for in Kuwait and are run to the coast of Persia between Lingah and Bushire, the carrier going halves in the ^ ertrcb A+*~ profits when disposed of. The difficult coastline of Persia is ideal for these operations. A few small cargoes are run to the Persian villages on the Banna shir channel running from Mohammerah to the sea: These are all small cargoes, however, and bring in little profit. (o) After Persia, most of the contraband trade trade leaving Kuwait goes into Nejd, sometimes by camel direct across the southern border, and at other times by camelscamels going west into the IRAQ southern desert and then when opposite Q ( assim, breaking up into parties of two and three and making for Qassim by a swift dash across the intervening desert. The most common method is for dhows to take cargoes down the coast to the vicinity of Jinneh Island and Abu Ali where there are a host of convenient shoals and hiding places. From there cargoes are landed on the mainland, where the starving Awazim, Ban! Ehalid, Ajman, and Mutair, who incidentally all have relatives in Auwait to put them wise are only too ready to cooperate if they safely can. / It may not be out of place to mention that at the time of writing, the duty fixed by the Sa’udiyeh Governor ment on Sugar entering Hassa is Hs.il/- on a bag costing Rs.ll/-, so it is worth risking much to get the stuff in free. (a) As regards IRAQ. , who, as I have mentioned aoove is the third in order of States sinned against: v7hat contraband does go from Ku*iit across her borders, is run in the following manner 1 . By small dhow to the entrance of the Shatt al Arab and to the upper reaches of Ehor Abdulla. 2 . By camel and donkey across the western frontier of Kuwait. Method (1) is managed usually as follows: Small tracers from the various villages on the IPAQ, the lowor reaches of the Shatt al Arab, come dorn^by small boat or 'Ballam' containing crews of perhaps 4 o 5 men e ch. They find things very cheap, as compared with the cost and trouble of getting the same articles at basrah. The difference is probably about a quarter of what they would have to pay in their country. These boats, which come laden with fruit, vegetables, firewood, etc. for all of which Kuwait is dependent on XRAU, f * 11 up wlth loads sufloads wufficient to fill their boats; approximately 10 to 30 bags of sugar or other dutiable articles. The crews then try and get back under cover of night, either by enteriig the Shatt al Arab and creeping past Fao Customs Post, or dumping their cargoes on the 'boggy' mud flats existing at the top end of the Khor Abdulla, v’dience confederates at once take the goods over, and hide them in the many villages and hamlets existing in the Palm belt of the Shatt al Arab, It is true that occasionally small Kuwait dhows are hired to run these cargoes, but they are the exception and not the rule. Method (S) is managed as follows, and as far as one can gather, much the bigger volume of contraband traf- i fic goes into IRAQ this way: For six months in each year Kuwait State Kuwait is overrun by the Buntafik and Eamar Lake shepherd tribes. Approximately some 15,000 persons male and female enter Kuwait after the first fall of rain (November) and spread themselves like locusts over the whole country from Safwan to the Kuwait Neutral Zone and as far west as Rigai in the Batin, These people are all the time sending parties into Kuwait to sell their sheep&gt; wool and gh©© and in return buy food and. clothing, part of which is of course for their own legitimate needs, but a large portion is for passing on to confederates, who come down from the Nupherates from as far west as Saznawa and live with them until such time as they can run the stufx they have bought across the western frontier of Kuwait, .these con federates are all tough and well armed customers, who dress and look like shepherds. They arrive with plenty of money either come into the town and buy themselves, or depute the shpherd tribal women to do so. The contraband so run usually goes through to the thickly populated tribal country- 8 / than not, paid agents of merchants in the towns along the Eupherates, sit quiet in camp and make their purchases through the medium of the Bedouin with whom they are living These latter can be seen in droves coming into the town daily, and marching back to their camps with fully loaded camels. If one stops ihem and asks where the stuff is going to, they invariably reply 'for ourselves and our friends, we are engaged in ’musabilah 1 : Iraq is too expensive for us to-day, and we are forced to come and buy our daily needs from Kuwait'. These Bhafir and Shanmar purchasers are of course run, by means known to the Bedouin only across to their brethern in IRAQ, and then slowly and surely and in small amounts, find their way up to the Supherates towns. Ori ginal bales boxes etc. are carefully broken and rep^acfed into smaller parcels before the Eupherates is reached. (f) It my be of interest to mention here that Haji Abdulla Villiamson at one time in our intelligence service used before the war to run camels and contraband from Kuwait to Damascus by the desert route. During the Munta— fik rebellion against the Turks on the Dupherates, he ran rifles and ammunition from Muscat to the rebels• Be used to land his cargoes on the Hana coast, south of the Kuwait Keutral Zone, convey them past Subaihiyeh and Jahara and across the Batin upto the Supherates and employed the Dhafir, Shammer and Ajraan Bedouin for the purpose as described in (e) above. Haji Abdulla, with whom I have discussed the contraband question, has expressed his en tire agreement with the contents of this 'Note'. IV. This contraband problem, I fear, is not going IV. to be an easy one for IRAQ to handle, nor would the Kuwait authorities find it any easier to tackle, however willing- 9 - ^ : y willing they he to cooperate. This for the simple reason that Kuwait (a) is looked upon by all Bedouin of north east Arabia as their natural home and market for fill their wants and it is the policy of Kumit to encourage this feeling inspite of Bin Baud’s Blockade; (b) Kuwait would to-day die a natural death if this one remaining outlet for her desert trade were denied her; (o) Any attempt of the Shaikh to control what the Bedouin bought or took out would be playing direct ly into the hands of Bin Baud, and would be a dead ly blow to his prestige. Furthermore it would be quite impossible for anyone in Kuwait to say what was legitimate or what illegitimate trade where the desert Arab was concerned. They come from the North, South, and West of the State, and it is not the shopkeepers concern to aks where their stuff goes, nor indeed would our friend of the Desert say where he intended to take his purchases for fear lest one of Bin Baud’s spies in the town r reported his movements to A1 Bagaawi, Bin Saud’s Chief \ Blockade Officer. Nor must it be forgotten that the Shaikh of Kuwait, does all in his power to encourage trade with the desert tribes in the hopes that all goods will eventually find their way to Nejd, and so annoy Bin Saud. Undoubtedly the one and only really effective or satisfactory method for Iraq to adopt will, in the long run, be to reduce her customs duties on all imports to the lowest possible figure that she can afford, this as a matter of policy . and above all to give up the idea entirely of treat ing her Customs Department as a revenue producing concern. IRAQ, is surrounded by long, lonely and ftifficult frontiers, all eminently aiited to the professional contra band runners methods. If she maintains her present very hi$i import duties, as she is trying to do, she will have to employ large numbers of preventive police, whose upkeep10 y upkeep and maintenance will swallow up all profits made. This is the writers considered view on the situation, and he has been able to study the problem from both sides of the picture, both when he was lolitical Officer in charge of the Muntaflk for 5 years, and to-day with his years experience of Kuwait. VI One last point. One notices that there is a grow ing tendency in IRAQ and elsewhere, to believe that the people of Kuwait Town are the actual 'contrabandists” and are the bold villains who are for ever going backwards and forwards into IRAQ plying their nefarious trade. This is an entirely erroneous idea. The Kuwaitis are quite content to sit in their shops and sell their wares. The actual con traband runners are always Persians, Nejdis or IRAQIS, who come frcm their own countries armed with the necessary funds. These gentry as mentioned elsewhere are always in the closest touch with confederates on their side of the border, miio are a necessary part of the game. VII A final point: Let it not be thought that no contraband comes.from Nejd into IRAQ, just because of the fact that Nejd maintains a higher tariff than IRAQ. It is common local knowledge that luxuries, such as silver thread 'Zerri', 'unwoven silks' and especially 'Japanese piece goods' which to-day are being dumped in ever increasing quantities and at far below fair trade prices, into the Hejjaz and Hassa, are regularly being brought up into IRAQ via Qassim, by Bedouins who have no transport charges to bear. It should never be forgotten that a camel journey from say I edina to IRAQ is nothing at all to a Bedouin. It is indeed a sort of pleasure and pastime, and enables him to see new faces, and bring back strange goods in return. in There are signs also that melted down silver is going/to IRAQ from Nejd today in considerable quantities. The IRAQ customs are no doubt aware of this. VTI -11 71X1. To sum up: If IRAQ seriously desires to check the flow of contraband across her borders, the writer with very great diffidence, offers the following advice: (a) She should reduce her present Customs all round, and get away frcm the idea of looking upon the Customs Department as a money producing con cern. (b) She should, as Bin Saud does, get her tribal elements on the border to assi st by offering them f of the proceeds of any contraband they can catch&gt; or be the means of catching. At the a&amp;iue time IRaQ, should realize that (b) is a double edged weapon, and one which like the 'boomerang' might easily come back and hurt the thrower - in this case, IRAQ.

I cannot do better than give you Beckett’s minute. It is as follows:- 'There is no international obligation upon 'Koweit to take active steps to prevent persons 'smuggling goods from Koweit territory into that of 'her neighbours. It would be wrong for the Koweiti Authorities to assist it, but that is another matter. 'At most the case cannot be put higher than to say 'that in the circumstances it would be hardly in 'conformity with the attitude of a friendly State 'for Koweit to refuse to consider any scheme of 'co-operation at all, if it were put up to her by 'Iraq and the scheme involved no burden on Koweit 'other than the loss of illicit profits; but even 'this, I thick, is putting the case rather high.' Yours ever, (SD.) Christopher Warner.

(See Pile II/5 Vol.3.). 3* On Monday nie 31st July (noon) . At the surgestion oi Ur.Ogilvie Porbes, I v/ent and saw Kr.Monk, Acting Director General of Customs, regarding the alleged excessive contraband that was passing from Kuwait into Iraq. I found Mr .Monk not particularly helpful at first. His attitude, I fear, was that of the Englishmen who has become more f Iraqi than the real article. Kuwait was the sinner and must be punished, Iraq was the poor suffering innocent party, struggling to do the right thing. Kuwait must be brought to her senses, either by the method of depriving her of her drinking water from the Shatt-al-Arab , or by a policy of super frightfullness on all and sundry caught smuggling. That is to say by shooting out of 1 hand any person so caught. Mr.Monk’s final contribution for the solution to the problem was for His Majesty’s Government to force Kuwait to raise her Customs duties to the same level as those of ’Iraq. This he assured me could and would be done sooner than I expected. After patiently hearing to all he had to say, I pointed out that (a) Kuwait was not hostile to Iraq as he seemed to think, (b) that the Shaikh was taking all precautions in his power to stop snuggling but had difficulties of finance, etc. (c) that Iraq were apparently under a serious delusion as to the amount of contraband that went from Kuwait. In reality the traffic was not great and the Bedouins were the chief culprits, but that they were most difficult to catch, seeing that they came in from all quarters of the aesert and bought/ Ibought only in small quantities and ostensibly for themselves# (d) I suggested that the Iraq Customs Department should really make some effort themselves to place Customs Posts on the 100 miles of Kuwait-Iraq land frontier. They had a single immobile post at Dafwan, which merely watched post at Gafwan, which merely watched the Basra - Kuwait motor roads, but that 80 miles of frontier was without a single post nor was a patrol ever sent along the Batin from Safwan to Rigai. In fact the door was entirely open, and the Bedouins had no difficulty in cross ing into Iraq whereever and whenever they wanted. (e) I suggest -ed that the f raq Customs would do well to place 4 Customs posts on this Batin line, instead of trying by a process of frightfulness and bluff to get Kuwait to do their work for them. (f) I pointed out that the Shaikh of Kuwait T s point of view could be put in a nutshell. He was sympathetic and would al ways do-his best to cooperate, but T raq must herself watch her own frontiers. It was not Kuwait 1 s business to do this. (g) Lastly I pointed out that with Bin Gaud’s Customs duties averaging 150 and ad valorem and Iraq’s averaging some 60 : p it was obvious that 90K of the contraband trade would go into Saudi Arabia, for clearly the profits were so much greater. Kuwait’s whole policy was to break Bin Gaud’s Blockade, whether by sea or land. They had a definite quarrel with Bin Baud but none with ’raq. (h) In conclusion I suggested with some diffidence that the Iraq Customs should be careful not to swallow all the stories of the many Kao and Zubair spies who they employees. These men had^ to live, and good information meant good pay. (i) I think I was able to make MrRIonk see a little of Kuwait’s point of view before I left.V :v No. ms % .

Humphrys explained that this memorandum had been given to him personally and unofficially, and that he would take the necessary action on it, merely leaving us a copy for record. I understand that Humphrys proposes to call a conference in Bagdad to discuss the question after the leave season is over, to be attendeu by himself, the competent Iraqi Ministers and advisers (including dievewright) and by the Political Resident and Dickson. This seems to us a good plan, more particularly as it fits in pretty well with the proposal) made by Fowle that the matter should be by Dickson and himself orally with Sievewright. view of wnat Humphrys has said we do not propose further action in the matter unless and until we him again. &lt; ri . Yours ever, , (Sd.) GEORGE RFKD1L discussed But in to take any hear from J.G. Laithwaite, Esq.,jur P* 2.4636/33 Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated jist July 1933. The situation of Koweit on the Persian Gulf adjoining the soutern frontier of Iraq, constitutes a very serious menace to the Customs revenues of Ira: owing to the smuggling that takes place therefrom. The problem has been under consideration for the last two years but no result satisfactory to Iraq has been reaahed in discussions that have occurred: on the contrary the position is developing from bad to worse. The smuggling takes place both by land routes and by water: the former in the extensive area between Basrah and Wejaf and the latter by means of the tidal inlet, .cnown as the Khor Abdalls, which gives direct access from Koweit to the neighbourhood of Zobeir. The area around Fao at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab frequented by boats that obtain the fresh water supply of Koweit from that vicinity, is also much used by traffickers in contraband trade, oince armed patrol cars have been instituted to protect the dobeir border, the illicit trade has been forced northwards as far as -Nejaf and seawards towards Fao. The incentive to smuggling is afforded by the low tariff rates imposed at Koweit on goods imported (believed in most cases to be below 10^») compared with the much higher duties/I duties levied in Iraq on the articles principally so traded in such as Sugar t iea f Coffee* Matches* Gigaret-te paper and Tobacco. It is not possible to state the extent of loss in Customs revenue to Iraq* but if it is assumed that the seizures made amount to one-tenth of the contraband trade then a rough estimate of £30*000 annually can be mentioned. It is possible that a certain quantity of this illegal trade emanates from Arabia proper* but the difficulties of transport in an almost waterless tract of desert help to discount this alternative. As a measure of prevention* the importation of manufactured articles of origin foreign to Arabia is forbidden across the land frontiers between Zobeir and Nej&amp;t and at places on the Chatt-al-Arab except Fao* Seeba* Abul ^asib and Basrah. The posting of an armed sea-going vessel to patrol the entrances of the Shatt-alArab and the Khor Abdalla is now contemplated. Smuggling being as profitable as it is found to be, there is reason to suppose that organized arrangements are being employed by the traffickers. Formerly the main trade of Aobeir was illicit, but the armed patrol cars have acted as a check to some extent and the area of wrong-doing is thus being spread. It is natural that bad characters - not necessarily residents of :&lt;oweit - are finding employment in the manner indicated and affrays are fre uent. Within the last year three ^uoijis (Iraq Customs guards) have been killed by rifle fire and quite as many smugglers have been similarly accounted for. It cannot be said that His Excellency the ; heikh of Koweit is a party to the malpractices describee:* but there is no doubt that his people - and perhaps some of his officials - find a very profitable living by what occurs. The Kingdom of Iraq and the State of Koweit are on friendly terms and it is very necessary that an agreement should be reached to put a stop/stop to an impossible condition of affairs which not only loses substantial revenue to Iraq, but involves a heavy expenditure on preventive arrangements which can never be entirely effective* Some measure of control of Xoweit trade and proper supervision over their Customs arrangements is urgently called for. The Iraq delegation wishes to discuss what form such control could take under conditions which would adequately safeguard its interests.CONFIDENTIAL. ✓It V No. 1147-S of 1933. lj*i +4- S' r so The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his phments to com- Political Agent, Kuwait, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned doom ment 2.

P. ^ou will observe that the ’Iraqi Government consider that no useful purpose would be served by a conference at Kuwait until the Ghaildi has agreed in principle to enforce certain specified measures of co-operation in Customs control, or has made concrete proposals of his own. In the light of the uncompromising expression of opinion contained in the enclosed note I feel that it would be quite useless to attempt to persuade the ’Iraqi Government to depute officials to dis cuss matters at Kuwait. I appears to be necessary for the Shaikh to decide whether or not he will agree to adopt one or other of the schemes suggested for his consideration. 3* 2 shall be glad to know in due course what further reply the Shaikh would wish to return to the ’Iraqi Govern ment on the subject. 4. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s ^incipal Secretary of State for foreign Affairs.

Smuggling between Kuwait and f Iraq« J Sir, nr With reference to your confidential No.ll47-S, datec the 31st August 1933, enclosing British 5in.bassy, Baghdad; letter No.36(357/35/33), dated the 19th August 1933, I have the honour to state in reply that although you asked for my views only, I considered it desirable to discuss the matter anew with His Excellency the Shaikh more especial ly ’Iraq Ministry of Foreign Affaires letter No.7423, dated the 8th August to H.B.M*s Embassy, a copy of which was also forwarded to me, under your letter referred to above. 2. His Excellency who is particularly sensitive about this matter of alleged wholesale blockade running from Kuwait into Iraq, expressed his sincere disappointment that the Iraq Government should have adopted such an uncompromisi? ing attitude as they have done, to the Hon’ble the Politi cal Residents very reasonable suggestion that a discussion at Kuwait might have useful results. 3. The Shaikh feels that the Iraq Government have, in this matter, made rather a mountain out of a mole hill, mainly due to interested parties having exaggerated and mis represented matters at Baghdad and he had hoped that it would have been possible to convince the Iraq Government through their chosen representative here that Kuwait was not- 2 - u Li * o g' not behaving as bad as she was painted. 4. As you will have observed the Shaikh definitely in his letter ot. ISth i ay lorwarded to you under this office confidential No.l03 t dated the 20th May 1933 inti mated his desire to live on amicable terns with all his neighbours, and in the case of Iraq to cooperate in any way that was possible, where questions of alleged smuggling arose, so as n to set their fear s e.v rest 11 , (his words). He slso said that he had given the strictest order to his offic ials to watch this particular problem very closely, though, as he said at the time to rae, he naturally could not, as the Head of the State admit of its existence. His Hxcsllency lastly pointed out in his letter that not a single steamship or sailing vessel could export anything by sea from Kuwait without being in possession of a properly documented ships manifest issued by his Customs Department and tinder the seal and signature of his Director of Customs. More than this it was derogatory to his rights and dignity as an Independent Ruler to go. 3. In the course of my present conversation with him His Excellency made it quite clear that it was quite impos sible for him to agree to the Iraq Governments proposals as forwarded in British Embassy, Baghdad E'o.20, dated the 31st March 1933, to your address, because to do so would be tantamount to admitting the overlordship of Iraq, and that she had a right to dictate to control the internal affairs of the independent State of Kuwait. 6. The Iraq Government,added His Excellenoy, was clear ly endeavouring to make him, the Shaikh, do their work for them, and spend, money on measures that were her responsibi lity entirely. Even if smuggling was going on with his knowledge there was no international obligation on Kuwait to take active steps to prevent persons smuggling goods from Kuwait into the territory of her neighbours. 7. It was surely the Iraq Government’s business and Qanything at all going cut from Kuwait into his dominions, but without real success; Iraq is threatening to act in simi lar manner, by asking Kuwait to agree to impossible conditions such as her posting of guard ships off the Shatt al Arab etc. 'tfhat is Kuwait’s answer? She merely asks both Bin Sand and in the present cese Iraq to do as other nations of the world do, and not interfere with her trade with the interior, but place a sufficiency of customs posts on or near the frontier line to ensure that customs duty is paid. But one cannot help feeling that Iraq, like Saudiyeh, does not want such an arrangement: rhe oeject of both being to kill Kuwait and not to collect eustems. 12. It may be of interest to know that from certain underground sources at my disposal, I learn that smuggling into Iraq has greatly decreased of late, and that far the greater quantity of contraband is today going into Ilejd. This is due, in the main, to the rumours of war between S^udiyeh and Yemen and the consequent lessening of control which has resulted. 13. Another point of interest is that several caravans at present small, have recently left Kuwait for the Hanran district of Damascus. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. uCONFIDENTIAL.

Kuwaiti bellum. 2. fhe official report accompanying the note from the Ministry reveals such a wide divergency in essential facts from the statements made in the enclosures to your despatch Ho. 567-S of May 29th that further representations to the ’Iraqi Government would not be justified without very careful k investigation into the true facts of the incident. According to the report of the Customs Officer, the bellum was no more than one hundred yards from the ’Iraqi shore of the Khor Abdulla when it was called upon to stop, and it was, there fore, a long way from being in Kuwaiti territorial waters. The statements of the Kuwaiti boatmen are silent regarding their having fired at the Customs launch, and convey the impression that the firing was entirely on the part of the ’Iraqis, 'efinite assertions are made by the Customs Officer that the bellum was the first to open fire, when called from upon to stop, that intermittent firing took place/the bellum, and that the Customs launch was hit in several places. If the bellum was in fact the aggressor in ’Iraqi w ters the incident assumes quite a different complexion. Lieut.-Colonel G. Loch, Offg.

Upon proceeding to inspect the hells® W h e „ the launch was wUhin hailing distance the crew of the b.ll Em warned them not to approach nearer, and ae the launch still proceeded the crew of the bellam opened fire upon it. Thereupon the Preventive Officer withdrew the launch, distributed arms and ammunition to his crew, and examined his stock of fuel, binding this low he put one of the crew ashore in a canoe to proceed across the s^t of land, a question of a mile or two ao with instructions to the sub-freventive Officer ln Charge t0 bring reenforcements including Police and extr, fuel in the launch -Arthenie*. he then kept the bellam ih Bight, the crew of which again opened fire as he approached and this time he ordered his crew to return the fire, and intermittent firing was kept up on both sides for some time. The bellam proceeded out to sea, and after 3 hours, ms fuel getting low and the other launch not having arrived the Preventive Officer * ve up the chase and returned to his case at i’ao. There he learnt that the other launch had gone ^ his assistance with re-enforcements of three policemen and two quolchis. This launch returned later in the day, at 3 p.m. without sight log the bellam. no eausalties occurred on our side as tr.e armour plating/ O / plating in the lore-part of the launch afforded sufficieht protection. The launch was hit in several places without material damage; one bullet pierced the brass airing clean supports, another passed^through the horn. It will bs seen from the above thats- 1. that the bellam w a a in 'Iraq waters being only loo y&amp;rds irom the shore on the eastern side of K.hor bdullah, just across the spit of land from ffao. this fact is confirmed by the fact of the Preventive Officer putting a man ashore to cross this narrow strip of land to bring re.enforcements from ifao, which, in fact, he did the same night of which there is ample proof. Owing to the width o.f the Khor Abdullah it will be seen from the map that this could have\not, been done if the bellem was on the wester* aide as alleged, 2. Ihe aggressors were the crew of the bellam. they opened fire on the Customs launch. 3. ihe details given of the damage done to the Customs launch confirms that the smugglers did use firearms and kept up their fire for sometime, this is not the action of innocent traders, 4. All smugglere from Kuwait to 'Iraq invariably provide chemselves with &amp; manifest from Kuwait to feo for use in f* case they are intercepted by our patrol boats and shepherded into ITao. This practice I have had personal experience of as far xk back as 1823. They also often carry manifests Tor usbah as well for use in case the Persian authorities intercept them, 5. no legitimate trader ships sugar from Kuwait to *Iraq the intention of paying •Iraq import duty. It is nn ind isputable fact that such a transaction must result in a loss. The Kuwait authorities admit that the bellam w a carrying sugar - this one fact alone indubitably stamps thetitae tr nsaction of one of attempted smuggling.

Presence, of armed * Iraqi Customs launch in Kuwait waters, between Maschan Island and Khor Subiyeh. Sir, f&gt; !VI In continuation of my telegram No.233, dated the 1st October 1933, I have the honour to forward translation of a letter No.R/3/l235, dated the 13th Jamad Thani 1352 (3rd October 1933), which I have re ceived from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. His Excellency the Shaikh first reported the launch incident to me at a Tennis Party on 29th September at 5 P.M., the day before the arrival of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf with 1st Destroyer Flotilla. He was clearly worried and asked me to telegraph a short summary of the incident to you at once. This I did on 1st October, as you are aware, and after His Excellency had also mentioned the incident to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 3* The Shaikh told me that he probably would not have heard of the matter for several days had he not himself visited Falaikah and Maschan Islands on the morning of 29th September, whilst on his way back from the pearl banks where he had gone to give the signal for the return of the Kuwait pearling fleet (guffal)* 4# The inhabitants of the Island, he said, re-reported to him that they had seen the Fao Customs launch eft tlife pi evious evening, and on several occasions during the latter part of September, moving about in most sus picious manner between the entrance to Khor Subiyeh and Maschan Island, and examining water boats and other sailing craft, who make a practice of using this channel when proceeding to and from Fao. £3ome of the islanders further testified that they had, on one occasion, seen the launch take shelter from a south east wind and anchor west of the Qasr Subiyeh promontory, that is to say, actual -ly inside the bay of Kuwait. 5* According to the Shaikh also, one or two of the islanders whose fishing boats had been held up, volunteered the further information that the launch crew had told them that their role was to hold up all craft carrying merchan dise from Kuwait to Fao (except water and fishing boats) and convey them to Fao, and charge their owners with smuggling and that no manifests in their possession would y help them, as the*e would be destroyed. This latter evi dence however, though important and though it bears out many other stories I have heard about the methods of Fao preventive officers, must be taken with reserve, I think. 6. In response to the Shaikh f s enquiry as to why they, the islanders, had not reported the presence of the launch to Kuwait earlier, they replied that as poor fishermen they had not dared to do so, lest their in formation eventually come to the ears of the Fao authori ties and they be punished by having their boats seized and nets destroyed (Not a difficult operation on a dark night) • 7* On the 1st and End October the Shaikh at my request proceeded to make immediate enquiries from some nakhudas of water boats, which had just come in from Fao. Their evidence he incorporated in his letter of 3rd October tome (under reference).8* H is Excellency verbally explained to me that he had found diificulty in making these men talk, for they one and all were engaged in carrying water from Fao f and some had families there. They were clearly afraid of consequences and begged him not to forward their names to the Political Agent (myself) as this would end in their certain ruin with the Fao authorities who would certainly, in due course, be supplied with the whole story, of how they had informed. For this reason, His Excellency said that he was averse to divulging actual names, at any rate for the present. He had however got their written statements and could get others from the Falaika Islanders if necessary. 9. According to His Excellency some of the boatmen when being interrogated pointedly asked what he, the Shaikh, had been able to accomplish about the Kuwait boat which had been attacked by the self same launch on the high seas at the end of June last, and had had 2 men killed and 2 severely wounded out of a crew of six. (See my letter No.264, dated the 6th May 1933). That inci dent, they said, was an utterly unprovoked attack on an innocent and harmless craft and happened far from the * Iraq Coast, the whole local seafaring world knew this. The very presence of the said launch today near Maschan clearly proved, they said, that the ’Iraq authorities ordered her to go far afield, and also as clearly showed that neither he, the Shaikh, nor the Political Agent, had been able to get satisfaction or compel the Customs De partment to confine their activities to their own ter ritorial waters. 10. As the Shaikh explained, and I fear I must agree with him entirely, the disturbing point about the whole thing is the irresponsible^ increased boldness shown by the Fao Customs authorities these days. For their launches to act so far afield from ’Iraq watersin other words they believe that His Majesty-s Government the protecting power is either powerless to do anything, or does not wish to bring pressure on the -Iraq Government. 11. In this connection I have only to refer you to the correspondence and especially to letter No.C/85, dated 24th June 1933 from the Director of Customs and Excise, Baghdad to the Ministry of Finance which was forwarded under your No.ll45-S, dated the 31st August to illustrate what I mean, 12, I greatly regret to have to say it, but the story put forward bears every indication of having been ^ entirely concocted, and if you will read my original despatch No,264, dated the 6th May 1933 carefully you will note that I prophesied that such a complete deni^g/ would be put up by the Customs Department. The Kuwait story of the attack was simple and straightforward one on that /v occasion, and one would have liked to see the ’Iraq Government do the honourable thing and admit excess of zeal on the part of their preventive police.Instead they, 2 months after the event took place, reply with the curious story that one armed launch (whose first volley had knocked out 4 men) could not single handed tackle a small dhow defended by 2 men only, but must needs send for another armed launch from Fao, to come to their assistance. They omit to mention that the 2 men escaped with their craft and brought her safely back to Kuwait, a not very creditable performance from their point of view if their story bore any relation to facts.5 £ | 11. X trust you will strongly press for a clear assurance from the ’Iraq Government that their armed patrols will not invade Kuwait waters again, and will coit, fine their activities to their own waters, otherwise the ' next thing we shaU hear of will be a sea fight between the Shaikhs amed forces and the 'Iraq Launch, which, needless to say, we all desire to avoid. 12. I am sending you 5 copies of this and trust that one may he passed to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, if you see no objection. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^ Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. VSS.i.p 821 sIs.'tion of letter No R/^/i^ •, Jamd than! 1S52 (3rd October i 933 , ( 1 ^™ d T a TJ ted 1 J he ^th Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Subah’ ^ ce llenoy Ruler of Kuwait, to the Politi^fl*^; 1 ^^;^!., After Compliments, ^ith reference to our verbal complaint with regard to the armed Fao Customs launch, I beg to infora Your Ficellenqy that the presence and activities of the said launc] in the shallow waters north and west of the Island of Mas chan have been confirmed, C’he most recent occasion on which the said launch was seen there, was by some waterboat nakhudas who ply backwards and forwards between Kuwait and Fao. These saw her on Wednesday the 27th September 1905 (i.e.eth Jamad thani 1552) in the morning at about 3 O’ Clock Arabic (8,20 A.M.}. Other nakhudas also depose to have seen her in the same place and on the same day at 1,30 Arabic time (7.A.M.). She was again seen (also by water boat nakhudas) on Thursday the 2Qth September 1933 (i.e, on the 7th Jamad thani 1352) in the evening at about 11 0» Clock Arabic (4.20 P.M.), Small boat-owners engaged in the Fao Kuwait ferry service from whom enquiry has also been made state that the above are not the only days on which the launch has been seen in Kuwait waters, but that on several other occasions prior to the ones mentioned above she has been seen moving about and keeping watch in and about the par ticular waters in question. I therefore beg to draw your attention to this transgression, which I never would have thought the Chief Fao Customs officer would have for a moment countenanced. I request that you be so good as to refer the matter to the authorities concerned and ask them to put an immediate stop to these activities, which are being practised by the Chief Customs Officer (at Fao). I make this protest and request lest a serious misunderstanding take place which may well spoil the relations of two good neighbours. Usual Ending.confidential. POLITICAL AGEN CY, KUWAIT. Dated the 18th October 1933 From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Eon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E . V Sir dated the 31st August 1933 with enclosures, which reached me on/7th September 1933, I have the honour to report that I addressed His Excellency the Shaikh officially on 21st September on the subject and furnished him with a translation of the Director of Customs and Excise, Baghdad’s letter No.C/85, dated the 24th June 1933 to the Ministry of Anance. I, at the same time, asked him to let me have any comment a that he desired to make on that official’s version of the shooting incident of 23rd. f 2, Owing to more important matters connected with his Fao Estates, and the recent visit of the Destroyer Flotilla, His Excellency was unable to reply till 15th October 3. His Excellency’s reply, No.R/3/1271, dated the 15th October 1933, translation of which is enclosed with this, adds nothing new to the original version of the story as supplied by him. Nor has it been possible for him, I know, to get any fresh evidence, beyond sending for and re- examining the two sailors who were unwounded and who2 - PV who brought the boat back to Kuwait; seeing that apart from their evidence and that of the two wounded men, which he also took down, no other Kuwaiti eye witnesses to the attack exist. 4. The Shaikh as you will observe clearly suggests that the Iraq version of the incident has been invented to enable the Director of Customs to exonerate his subordinates. His Excellency also makes good play of the fact that if the Fao Customs authorities are deceitful enough to send their launches to Maschan Island, 30 miles from Iraq territory, and well within Kuwait waters - see my confidential No.245 dated 14th October 1933 - they are capable of doing anything shady, let alone concocting a story like their present one. 5. My views are, and have been aftle to collect no fresh evidence to make me alter them, that the original Kuwait story of the attack was a simple and straightforward one, and far more likely to be the true version than the complicated and rather wonderful one put forward by the Director of Customs, and two months after the incident took place. Their story as put forward, that one armed launch, whose first volley had knocked out 4 out of a crew of six j could not tackle a small boat defended by 2 survivors, but must needs send for another armed launch from Fao to come to their assistance, does not ring true. i? Nl 6 m As I had occasion to remark in my confidential des patch No.245 f dated the 11th October 1933; one would have liked to see the ’Iraq Covernment do the honourable thing and admit excess of zeal on the part of their preventive Police. Kuwait would have reacted immediately and generously, I am very sure. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, v Lt.-Colonel, ^ political Agent, KuwaitAfter Compliments, In replying your confidential letters Ho.225, dated the 1st Jamad than! 1352 (21.9.33), and Ho.246, dated the 24th Jamad than! 1352 (14.10.33), I heg to give your Excellency my further comments with regard to the killing of the two Kuv/aitis by the armed launch belonging to the Fao Customs, and the wounding of two others in the same incident. I have gone through the report of the Iraq Customs Director, copy of which you sent me, and I find it far fromOfficer of 7ao is trying to exonerate himself, when he states that the incident happened within 100 y^ards from the Iraq shore and when he says that he landed one of his crew on the same shore to get help from Fao. (bO Lastly I want to assure Your Excellency that the above Officer is not content with his practice of exploring the whole estuary of the Khor Abdullah, hut has bson seen several times lately near Mas chan Island, about 15 miles from Iliwait as I have already reported in another letter. I have got the facts from the nakhudas of certain boats, who regularly meet her in this place (Maschan). It does not need mUCh inte lli^enc 0 for four iixcellency to realize that if the Officer Commanding the launch can come as far and explore these places, (50 miles from Iraq waters) he is quite cap able of saying that the incident which we are discussing happened within 100 yards from the eastern coast of Khor Abdullah.

Yesterday afternoon I went to Mulla Saleh, the Secretary to H.E. the Shaikh, where I found the wounded man therd, Hasan bin Abdullah. The latter stated that the two safe persons have left for Bushire to their families there, because they are Persian subjects. Their names are Mohammed and Abdullah, and he could not give'us the names of their fathers. The wounded persons he and Abdu-Shah are Kuwait subjects. The latter died at Basrah, because his wound was mortal. The killed NakhufLa is a Persian subject. When I enquired from the above Hasan how the incident happened, he said that happend in the morning, baatr during ( the launch crew) their firing thsy/broke the rudder of the boat, so the tide drifted it ashore, and the boat stranded in the mud at Ras-Bubian. They brought the launch near the stem of the* stranded boat, where it also stranded. They remained in their place all day # They floated after suns@^&gt; nnd then the launch towed the boat to Foo.Ho. 263. let oveisiber FOUTICAL J0BKCT t rOWAXT. froci Lt#—Colon# 1 H. &gt; * •) ■ • 1)1 ok son 9 1*a. # IoXitioal Kuwait; Tfc® Hon f bl# tha Political in th© I'erslan Gulf t B u s h 1 r a r rlnrc on and aeisuro of a 1 await jolly boat by ’ao CuatoMi launch mar Pubiyan Island on 15th Octo ©r.

The mn, Hasaan’s statamant, though confused where ho tries to describe actual dates, ia, as you will see, a simple mt straightforward one. In © perrone.1 interview, which I had with him, he mde the following definite statement, which no amount of cross- q^mstlonlag c»i. my part could shHce; (a) The jolly bor* t was -3Eip^ when shot up and captured.

The inference being that she had discharged her cargo on the Iraq shore and was making off, 4* if the evidence of Hassan bin Abdulla is a true statement of fact, and I see no reason to doubt it, after the severe cross questioning that I put him through, items (a), (c) and (d) of the preceding paragraph would appear to have been wholly indefensible acts on behalf of the Customs launch, Further from statements (b) , (c) and (e) it would appear quite clear that the attack was made in Kuwait waters Bubiyan Island being a part of Kuwait State, ^is regards (f), (g) and (h), it would appear that Hussain Effendi realizing he had done wrong, did everything to throw dust in the eyes of the Police Officer for obvious reasons. 5. My inspection of the Kuwait Customs House books shows that on the date in question, llth/l2th October, thisthis particular Jolly boat did in fact clear for Bandar out a proper manifest far that port. 6. Further enquixy shows that the owner of the boat was a Kuwait subject of Persian origin, the Nakhuda (killed) owner of the boat a Persian subject. Hie man Hassan bin Abdulla (wounded) and AbduX shah ( died of wounds), were Kuwait subjects (former an Arab, latter domiciled Persian), and die other two unwounded men, Mohamad and Abdulla were Persians, residents of Dilam, I regret I have not been able to take the evidence of the men Abdulla and Mohamed, as these men returned to Bushire direct from Basra. 8* His Excellency the Shaikh in a talk which he haa with me, stated that vfoile it was just possible that the boat had been engaged on a smuggling expedition, it was pretty obvious that her destination had been Persia and not 9 Iraq. In my case one fact remained clear: She was empty at the time of the attack, and was wending her way peacefully to Kuwait, her home part# 9 ttiat His Excellency objects to so strongly, and rightly so, I think, is that the jolly boat was attacked and taken in Kuwait waters. There can be no doubt of this in view of the evidence, seeing that both she and the attacking launch lay aground on Bubiyan Island the best part of a whole day. 10* The Shaikh points out that, were the Fao Customs people playing the. game according to the rules, and dis playing their anti-smuggling activities within ’Iraq water only, there would be entire confidence all round and no one would complain, least of all himself, but the reverse was the case, as witness the similar affair of last April (See my No.264, dated the 6th May 1953), and the recent operations of f Iraq Customs launches close in to Kuwait,Kuwait, between Maschan Island and Khor Subiyeh* (See my despatch No,245 of 11th October 1955). 11. I trust a very strong protest will be made to the ♦Iraq Government in this matter, also that same will be backed by a demand for Ks.60Q/-, blood money to go to the relatives of the murdered man Abdu Shah, and Rs.200/-, blood money, for the wounded man Hassan bin Abdulla. I am purposely asking nothing Cor the murdered Nakhuda, as he is not a Kuwait subject. At dhe same time a demand might be sent for the early return of the captured jolly boa t. 12. It is, I think, worth recording in the present instance, that certain Kuwait water boat Hakhudas, who were at Fao when the jolly boat was towed in have related that they saw and heard Ar.Phillip Klowe, Hussain Kffendi’s superior Officer at Fao, have words with the latter, when he made his preliminary report. He publicly accused his subordinate of stupidity in bringing in an empty boat, and above all of cruelly in firing on men who had obeyed orders and heaved to. Hussain Sffendi, nothing daunted, had replied hotly M You did the same yourself last June, you need not talk. You taught me the game and I am only fol lowing your example n . 13. No evidence has been forthcoming at this end of the jolly boat having returned the fire of the launch, but if they did, I do not blame them ; for all sea-going Kuwait / boats carry a rifle or two under licence given by this Agency. 14. In anticipation of your approval I am sending a copy of this, direct to the Kenior Haval Officer, iersian Gulf, together with 4 spare copies for yourself.

AFTER COMPLIMENTS. I am forwarding herewith the signed statement of of one of the jolly boat’s crew, by name Hasan bin Abdullah, regarding the affair which took place between them and the Fao Customs launch during which her (the jolly boat's) nakhuda was shot dead, and two others were wounded, one of the latter being the above mentioned Hasan. The incident took place when they were returning from Bandar DILAM (Persia). It appears further from the man's statement that the attack took place near * Has Bubiyan ', this for Your Excellency's information.

The officer in charge pretends that he dhouted to us to lower our sail, we certainly did not hear him, all we know was that he fired four rifle shots at us. We signalled to him not to shoot, and as the weather was calm, we shouted to him (the officer) to bring his launch alongside* He however refused, and opened a steady rifle fire on us and continued same, till he had killed our nakhuda, Haji by name, and wounded Abdu Bhah, who at the time was holding the mainsail rope and lowering the sail* We were close to the land of B^biyan* Next I was hit whereupon the remaining 2 of our crew threw thon- selves into the Sea and swam to the launch where they were bawled on board* They explained to the officer (Hussain Effendi) that he led killed one man and wounded two more, and that their boat carried no cargo at all* The officer at first tied them up and heat them severely, then he untied one man and sent him across in a f, dug out n canoe to fetch Abdu Shah and myself to the launch* After that the launch came along side our boat, which in the meantime had grounded by the stern. The launch also went aground. In the evening at about 2 O'clock Arabic (7.15 P.M.) , we both got off with the tide, and the launch towed us to the 'Bangalah' (Fao Customs House).

Copy. ^.4*. British Embassy, Bagdad. 8th December, 1933. Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to transmit herewith a trans lation of a letter from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait together with a copy, in translation, of a statement made by one Hassan ibn Abdullah, who was a member of the crew of a Kuwait sailing boat which was attacked by an Iraqi Customs launch on or about October 15th last. 8. As a result of that encounter one member of the crew was killed, one died of wounds in Basrah, and Hassan ibn Abdullah was wounded. 3. It appears from the statement, and from a subsequent close interrogation of Hassan ibn Abdullah by His Majesty’s Political Agent at Kuwait, that the boat was empty of cargo when it was attacked, and that the attack took place close to the South-East corner of Bubiyan island, which is Kuwait territory, and therefore occurred in Kuwaiti territorial waters. Shots appear to have been fired as a warning, following which, despite the fact that the boat had stopped and signalled the launch to come alongside, the Customs launch opened a steady and fatal fire upon the boat and its occupants. Both the launch ana the Kuwaiti boat subsequently went aground on Bubiyan island, which is Kuwait territory, ana are said to have remained there from the morning until the early evening, when the tide permitted them to refloat. The crew of the boat, including/ Excellency Nuri Pasha A1 Said, G.C.V.O.,C.M.G.,D.3.G., Minister for Foreign Affairs, B a g d ad. Hisincluding the dead and wounded men.,were then taken to Fao, where the 'boat was impounded. 4. The Political Agent, Kuwait has verified hy an inspection of the hocks at the Kuwait Customs House that on the li/12th October the boat in question cleared a small general cargo for Bandar Dilam in Persia and took out a proper manifest for it. The occupants of the boat state that tae^ actually lanueo. oueii cax go at nanuai Dilam and were returning peacefully to Kuwait without cargo, when the Customs launch encountered them. 5. Your Excellency will no doubt agree that, if the above statements are substantiated, and an armed Iraqi Customs launch did in fact fire upon a Kuwaiti boat within Kuwaiti territorial waters, causing loss of life and injuries, a most serious view/ must be taken ot the incident. 6. Your Excellency will recollect that an attack by an armed Customs launch upon a Kuwaiti boat, which is alleged to have occurred outside Iraqi territorial waters and which also resulted in loss of life, was reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the note from His Majesty's Embassy, No.303 of June 10th last. 7. I therefore have the honour to request that Your Excellency will cause an immediate and careful enquiry to be made ihto this regrettable occurrence and that I may be informed of the result in order that the matter may be further considered. 3. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consiueration (sd.) F.H.HUMPHBYS•N q • 6 9 0 . British Embassy, Bagaaci. llth December. 1933 Monsieur le Ministre, 'With reference to my note No.686 of December 8th, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that complaints have been made to me during recent months from the Shaikh of Kuwait, through the ir’olitical Agent, to the effect that an armed Iraqi customs launch operate regularly in the channel between Mashyan Island and the Entrance to Khor Subiyeh on the route followed by sailing craft travelling between Kuwait and Fao. 2. I am advised that the channel in question is well within the territorial waters of Kuwait and would invite attention to Your Excellency's secret letter of luly 21st, 1932, (No.2944), wherein the boundaries of Kuwait are specifically defined as including Mashyan Island. I would accordingly urge that immediate instructions be issued to the commander of the patrol vessel in question to refrain from operating in such waters. 3. In view of the present unsatisfactory situation, it would appear most desirable that the Iraq.i Customs officers on the spot, who appear to be unaware of the territorial limits within which tuey can legitimately operate, should be given definite information and instructions on this subject, and that infringements should be adequately punished in future. In cider to minimise the danger of the deplorable incidents mentioned in my note under reference, and to clarify the/ His Excellency Nuri Pasha A1 Said, Gr.C.V.O.,C.M.G.,D.o.O*| Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad.0, - 2 - the position for the future, I suggest that an opportunity should he taken for a conference at Bagdad O' , **“ rrln,ir between representatives of the Iraq.i Grovernment and of the Shaikh of Kuwait'to discuss what practical measures should he adopted to ensure observance of the law in this region, I need hardly add that my good offices are available in whatever steps Your Excellency may take in the interests of peace and good order on the Iraq-Kuwait boundary. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest considera tion. (sgd.)

Dated the 18th January 1934 From Lt.-Colonel Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Firing on and seizure of a Kuwait 'Jolly' Boat by Fao Customs Launch near Bubiyan Island on 15th October. V Sir With reference to my despatch No.263, dated the 1st November 1933, and paragraphs 6 &amp; 11, I have the honour to report that the sailor Abdul Shah was wrongly, but rather excusably, reported by me as having died of wounds at Basra. 2. It appears that Abdul Shah f s relatives, who are quite poor people here were told by the Fao Police that he had died and been buried at Basra and that was the end of the story from thj^e point of view. 3. What actually happened was that Abdul Shah hovered between life and death in the Basra hospital for 3^ months, made a remarkable recovery and returned to his delighted family literally 1 as one from the dead* on December 20th last. He, however, had a relapse on arrival and was again confined to his bed till 10th January. 4* Abdul Shah’s wounds were (a) a rifle bullet through the right thigh high up; (b) another rifle bullet through the lower part of his back which passed through his body and out to the front completely severing one testicle and half his penis. Wound (b) has maimed Abdul Shah for life. 5* His Excellency the Shaikh sent Abdul Shah to me on 15th January thinking I might like to take his evidence. 6 . The man was still suffering from the effects of- 2 of his wounds, but was able to confirm the whole 'shooting” story as reported by me. He however made the additional statement that he had not been shot in the preliminary general firing that took place on their boat, but in a manner savouring of a deliberate attempt to do murder. He said that firing had ceased altogether and the launch crew, finding that no one returned their fire called out 'We give you peace (Aman) . We will not fire any more. Expose yourselves'. He thereupon stood up (he had been lying down taking cover) and lowered the sail, began to furl it with his back turned towards the launch. Suddenly a volley was fired and he fell wounded from behind in two places. 7. He emphasized (as already reported) that there was no wind at all when he was lowering the sail and the inci dent took place. He also 'swore on oath' that the boat had been on a legitimate trip to Bandar Dilam, was empty when it was ’shot up’, and carried no firearms at all. 8. The man volunteered the interesting information which I certainly had not heard before that both Phillip Effendi and Hussain Effendi had since been removed from their posts at Fao. 9. In the light of the above events, I desire to modify paragraph 11 of my despatch Ho.263, dated the 18th November, referred to at the beginning of this report and trust that the blood money asked for by me from the ’Iraq Government as compensation be altered as follows. (a) fts.400 for the man Abdul Shah. (He is maimed for life). (b) Hs«200/~ for Hassan bin Abdulla. (Wounded but recovered). 10. I would aesl reiterate my request that the jolly boat be returned by the Customs authorities to the rightful owner at an early date. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, IaP ^ .
