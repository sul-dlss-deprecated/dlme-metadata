Under Secretary to ih e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Office of the High Connnissioner, Baghdad, 4th Kay 1921. From His Exoellency the High Gominissioner, To His Exoellency Shaikh Sir Abdul Aziz 'bin Abdur Rahraan al Faisal al Saud, G.G.I.E. Ruler of Nejd and Dependancies. A.O. On the 7th of April I had the pleasure of sending Your Excellency from Basrah a short telegram informing you of my return and saying that I would communicate further after reaching Baghdad and receiving the latest news from your side through your delegate Ahmad Beg bin Thanayan. I now have the honour to address you again. Before leaving for Cadro I addressed to you three letters dated 15th February and one dated 18th February through Political Agent, Bahrain® I trust they reached you safely. I am now able to inform you of the decision of His Majesty*s Government regarding two more of the questions which were then outstanding between us namely; Firstly the amount of financial help which the British Government feel able to continue to afford to you and Secondly the question of your title in the future as ruler of your territories. In regard to the first matter I am now informed that His Majesty 1 s Government after full discussion feel unable owing to the very stringent financial situation that exists in England (as well as in other countries who were engaged in the late war) to accept the recommendations made(S) in your behalf in full. The Right Honourable the. Secretary of St '.te was most sympathetic at the Conference and I am ana sure ^ave all the help that he possibly could but it will not be hidden from you that the Cabinet of His Majesty's Government is obliged to consider such a matter not only by itself on its own particular merits but also in conjuntion with several other parallel cases and it was considered that full compliance with our recommendations made in regard to yourself would have placed His Majesty^ Government i»| a vei' embarrassing position in relation to other friends. Eventually it was decided that the present subsidy of £ 5000,/- per month should be continued to you and that in case at the present juncture you might be troubled with any temporary inconvenience a special cash gift of £ 20,000/- in addition to the subsidy for the current month should be now afforded to youo I should explain that this friendly decision and others which are under discussion are of course ' contingent upon Your Excellency's faithful observance of certain preliminary stipulations which I will specify later in this letter, but which indeed differ little from those which have always existed between yourself and my government in the past. Before leaving this subject of your finances, I think it well to explain to Your Excellency that I am 1 authorised to assure you, that at any rate, it is not the intention of His Majesty's Government to afford to His High ness the Sherif of Mecca any greater financial assistance than they are fixing for yourself. Of that you may rest assured. The second matter is the question of your assumption of a royal title.In this connection it gives your friend much pleasure to be the medium of intimating to you that should you see fit the desire or with the consent of your subjects(3) to assume the title of Sultan of Nejd and its dependencies, His Majesty 1 s Government will be prepared to accord their recognition of such a title. The title which I have cited above seems to be the most suitable and natural one for Your Honour to assume and I think this was your own view also. Accordingly in regard to this matter I shall await a further communication or announcement from yourself. As regards the question of your boundaries with Kowait, Praise be to God, this difficulty has been greatly simpli fied by Ahmad bin Jaabar's accession to the Shaikhship and 'by his satisfactory meeting with you. The present position therefore is as follows Please refer to my letter of the 15th February. The territory included in the Red Circle is what His Hajesty's Government have definitely recognised to be the undisputed territory of the Shaikhdom of Kuwait and that being the case of they count on Your Excellency 1 s acceptance/that decision. As regards the tefcMtory lying between the red a.nd green lines on the rap it is perhaps superf^Qous now, in view of the satisfactory understanding which has been reached between yourself and Shaikh Ahmad bin Jaabar to pursue the question of your claims or his o (§f ]jims within this outer area. I should like your views on this point, that is to say whether you wish to pursue the matter j &amp;rther of wish to leave it as it is. The best plan would seem to be for you and Sh ikh Ahmad bin Jaabar to come to a friendly understanding and inform me what solution you have reached. ?wo other matters which I should wish to discuss are the question of this year^ pilgrimage and the status of Khurma and Turabaho As regards the former I have informed His Majesty's Government that you have had considerable difficulty in(4) in prohibiting your subjects from undertaking the Haj for the past two seasons running; tha.t you cannot see your way to do this a third time and consider it essential that those who wish to proceed this year should be allowed to do so. Further that while it is obviously not possible for your subjects to make the journey without arms for self-protection, nevertheless you are prepared to give full assurances that they shall indulge in no active aggression against the Sherif or his subjects during their passage through Hejaz territory. In return for this assurance I am asking.that assurances may also be taken from His Highness the Sherif that he will reciprocate the above undertakings and that your subjects will be given the same consideration as other pilgrims. I trust this will appear satisfactory and reasonable to you. Then as regards the status of Khurma and Turabah, I have informed the Secretary of State that in view of the difficulty at the present juncture of arranging for any British Commission to proceed to the spot for deciding the status and fixing boundaries of that region, the best solution and one which I am sure will be accepted by your self would appear to be that His Majesty T s Government should announce that they consider Khurma and Turabah to be in a position of local independence or sAitonomy under a Governor chosen by themselves, and that the latter will deal with the Hejaz Government in matters concerning Hejaz and similarly with Tour Excellency in matters concerning your Goverrmient and your tribes. 1 trust you will inform me of your approval of such a solution. The last thing that I have to touch upon is the subject of the conditions of which His Majesty's Government ask your acceptance in return for their friendly support of your interests as above indicated. These conditions aret—(5) (i) That you refrain and restrain your adherents from aggressive action against the Hejaz, PCuwait and Iraq (ii) that 37-on afford co-operation in the matter of the Haj by maintaining the safety of pilgrims routes to your territory,, (iii) that you consent to be guided generally by the wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to your foreign policy and to co-operate with them in promoting their own policy which has for its object, the maintenance of peaceful conditions in Arab countries and the promotion of the economic interests of both parties* (iv) I must explain to you confidentially that the question of the future form of G-overnment and the rulership of the independent Arab State of Iraq is one which will have to be decided within the next few months. The attitude of His Majesty's Government in this matter is this. Subject to the reservation that the future / ruler must be one whom they regard as suitable, they desire to be guided by the wishes of the majority of the poeple of Iraq, They have no intention of imposing anybody upon Iraq against the will of the majority. In this connection as you perhaps are aware there is talk re the candidature among others of one of the s ons of ti e Sherif. The fact is that the Sherif has been informed in answer to his e^uiries and claims, that the attitude of the British Government is as above explained and has been told that if the people of Iraq want one his sons and if one of the said sons wishes to accept the rulership. His ^jesty's Government will not stand in his way. But should the people of iraq express a wish for him, one the primary conditions which the British Governmenr Required from him before they accepted him would bo that h© should ''^ertake to come to a satisfactory undertaking with yourself - an understandingwhich His Majesty's CTOvernment would expect me to negotiate. They also ask the same condition of Your Excellency namely that should such a contingency arise as the accession of a son of the Sherif, to the rulership of Iraq you should be prepared to enter into a treaty of neighbourly peace with him I informed His Majesty's Government that I felt quite confident you would be ready to fulfil your part in the above connection when the matter were explained to you and you were informed that if Iraq decided in favour of a son of the Sherif, the policy of the British Government would be as above describedo Your friend wishes greatly that he could have had the advantage of a meeting with you at this important juncture buo it hardly seems possible, as I cannot leave here just now&lt; Failing that 1 had hoped to send a trusted representative to discuss uhose matters fillip with you but that again owing to the reason and the uncertainty of your own movements does not appear feasible# 1 have been obliged therefore to have recourse toa letter in the first instance which will be supplemented b- full explanations by Ahmed Beg Thanayan© I very much hope that the letter will find you in the best of health and your affairs prospering. SD/~ p. z. COS. High CommissionerI o No. 9532/10 To His Excellency Shaikh Sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al Faisal al Saud, g.o.i .E., Ruler of Nejd &amp; Dependencies* A.0, I have received your letter dated 29 Jaraad Thani 1539 making complaint that the Azaizah tribe «had seized goods belonging to a certain caravan of Agail merchants, and en quiring whether it is my wish that questions of this nature should be decided by correspondence between the High G-overn- ment and Tour Excellency or be left for you to settle direct with the Chief of the tribe concerned. As this is a question of policy which will affect other references also I will not in this letter discuss the details regarding the particular incident referred to above. These will be considered in detail in a sub .sequent letter» In this letter I wish only to express my recognition of your wise understanding and correct Statesmanship in addressing me first. Matters of this nature can only be decided by the High Authorities concerned and I have therefore instructed your representative Dr. Abdulla that and this which is evidently your wish is mine mlso /that letters on subjects such as this should be delivered to me and not to the Shaikh of 'Iraq® sd/- p. z. cox.

This decision is being vigorously contested but meanwhile it must be upheld and the short payments from India accepted and handed over on receipt. (2) Your proposal to arrange for the payment &gt; of the subsidy at Bahrain in rupees at the gold rate, which was referred home, under High Commissioner's tele- ' f gram No. 564 of 10th October,1921, of which a copy was sent to you^ must,therefore, remain in abeyance until a final decision on the question of the sterling value of the subsidy is arrived at.

It has been represented to them that insistence on recovery will cause considerable difficulty and a final decision is awaited. If recovery is ordered the sum of £.3,741-5-1 must be recovered before the end of the present financial year, i.e. from either the January or February subsidies.

Sir Abdul Azii; i\m Abdul Rahman al Faisal al ya^ud, (i.C.I.E Sultan of A'ajd and Dependencies, A/C On 3rd t&gt;afar 134C (6th October 1921) Your Highness Yvrote to'me a letter in which you pointed out that there had been some delay in the payment of your subsidy and of your present from his Majesty (iovernment, iour Highness* letter has already been answered by actions which are better than words, and I hope that the difficulties to which you referred will have been removed many weeks before this letter reaches you, I have however been at considerable pains to find a suitable method of paying the subsidy which will put an end once and for all to the troublesome delays which formerly occurred. As Dr.Abdullah will tell you there has been much correspondence on this matter between myself, His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India. A complicated question of exchange due to the present difference in value between the English Pounds and the E nglish Gold sovereign has arisen, I will not however trouble you with the details of the intricate financial difficulties involved,but you may rest assured that through -out the discussion i have always had your interests at heart. l will now acquaint Your Highness vith the decision which has been reached by His Majesty's Government as to the method by whlit the subsidy will be paid in future. firstly to avoid any possibility of further delay due to the shipment of cash from India it has been decided that the subsidy whall be paid at Bahrain through the Eastern Bank,and an arrangement has been made with the Bank whereby the subsidy for the previous month may be drawn by(2) • by your Agent at Bahrain on the first of each month,'beginning fro re February 1st. secondly,in order that this arrangement may be carried out,it is necessary that the subsidy should be paid in rupees instead of in gold,and His Majesty's Government has ruled that the rate of exchange shall correspond to the sterling rate of exchange at Bombay. This method will have for you the two following advantages: - First it will no longer be necessary for you to pay for the cost of transport of the subsidy from India to Bahrain. secondly you will have the satisfaction of knowing that in future you will always receive the subsidy promptly on the first of each month without any of the vexatious delay which has occurred hitherto, 1 hope that Your Highness will agree that this is the best possible solution of the problem, as your friend I tell you frankly that I consider it to be the best possible arrangement for you that could have been made in view of the many difficulties involved. u.

But ho is not too fit having been out here a long time and so wants to have bis recess this year and I propose to let him go on July 25rd for the best part of 5 months. It is thin fact that has Drougixt utors to a head and forced me to write th? s j.oT'tr• ihat can be done, when Daly is awayt I doubt if bne rk^ad Cierk (D l Hello) who will be in charge and the 11- 1 - i/Orpre b8r can do relied upon to make really accurate translations of letters etc telegraphed for Bin Saud. Of course if you think there is not likely to be much and telegraphic work,/that moat of it will be hy latter, that '.ould aettle the natter; or If oorrespondonco could be conducted through Kuwait. Ii. not it seems to me the only thing would be to send a really competent trustworthy man capable of ma 7 'inn- accurate translations from English into Arabic and vice vorsa to be personal Assistant to Political Agent for Central Arabian affairs who could conduct the corresponden- ce during the recess and remain and virtually do it all for tho Political Agent when he returns to headquarters. Cwtn something of this sort bo arranged 4 ? Tf not I fear the Head Clerk and Interpreter will make a muddle of the business.

There is only one thing more that I ardently desire and that is a personal interview with your Majesty at a time that may be convenient to you when my official duties will permit me to be absent from my post for a short while. It is therefore that I beg iour Majesty to give me timely notice of your arrival near the coast say in Al Ahsa when it may be convenient to meet. me. « 1 shall spare no pains in the endeavour to keep the appointment.

The crux of the wh ^le matter is that che Sultan nf Hoid is vain ly endeavouring to escape the inoonvonionc© to his subjects of there being no British Con mil In hie dominions; and Iraq and India, to which two countrlea his subjects chiefly tra vel, are inclined to Insist on the visa of a irltfeh Consul, and the most appropriate individual to fflx thit visa is a the Political Agent,B-ihra in# ¥hsre ni&amp;o nosslbiy lurVs in th&lt;* mind c the Sultan an^ Inclination to 11 *ht- n the strin gs 'f authority round the necks of his subjects reside? nt in Bahrain. The envoy cited to me the ©acainple of His pritannic ^ajosty's Consul at Daraascus who, he allogod, p^rfwws all such good offices for Nejda, ^retis I r-pil ttet t could not challenge his statsfnent and was c|Uite pr^^ared to ac cept it but that I was quite sure tht, if the eritieh Con sul at i^ans^scua had the misfortune to be stationed at Bahr ain, he would be quite unable to favour the Kejada in t hfe way without being exposed to a sterra of hostile critlclsfn from foreigners not so favoured. I understand froia Major Daly that the visa fee is really auito a trifling matter and goes to pay for the clerks who actually do the extr^ passport work. A good deal of trouble throughout these negotiations was caused by the very natural desire of Bin v&gt;.x 1 in !»'• the ^hole way clear before his in any policy instead of experimenting in individual cases, pointing out : -r/4 out concrete Instances where hardship if? involved Wid ..then addressing u» with a view to the rernov^l of those grievunoes* The passport nu&amp;mt ion received an amount of i .lscusnion euite d 1 si)reportlonate to its importance* At the close after rny Secretary, tirho deals with ConaiTiar matters, had been Wrought in find given his opinion on the question® &amp;t iaeue, t think the envoy really began to appreciate our difficulties in giving favoured treatment ar* 9 t-c und^r«t-«'-1 that riejada were being treated exactly lil:e other nat tonal it i^si for he asked me to embody my point of view in a, letter to bin Saud dated the 20th June, ^o • 4 of the correspondence• 10• Letter No* 8 aissod at being nothing but a polite letter closing the correspond once, paying a well-deserved tribute for the manner in ''hlch his envoy conducted the negotiations ^nd expressing an a ^iible hope that a meeting between the Bui tan of Jfejd and the political Resident would plane away all asperities* 11* It only remains to allude briefly to the three demi-official letters .o* 9, 10 and 11, which close the list of corr©spondonce* They were purposely mde d«wl- offlcial as I declined to cr -zlt myself ^ writing to the Sultan of flejd in regard to the three ratter^ raised* Of the three, the envoy was inclined to insist, here rather fron a personal point of view, on the return of Abdulla A1 Qasaibi to Bahrain* He s^id he could not return to Hiyadh empty-handed and hoped that tho return of Abdulla A1 Qiisalbi - the envoy was careful to add •of course in a purely private capacity 1 * — would be warmly appreciated by the sultan as a burial of the hatchet at his (the nultan 1 ®) recfuest * 12* i declined to accede to the request that f ohamwed rfherif should be sacrificed as a counterpoise to the de|K&gt;s- \ ition of Qasaibi for I have every ^ecuranee from the Political Agent, Bahrain, that HOhmmmr* Sharif is » thoroughly useful and enlightened member of society and behaveti very well during the recant disturbances, but I said that I had no objootion te writing him in general^terms a warning }etter through thethe Political Ag-^nt# iiahr^ln ( o«10 of the correar^ondane# )• Finally the Agent pr^ssr- 3 fcr a r^e^^ltlon hj me of Abdu* Aziz A1 Qasaibi, even though merely as private agent, without a direct renuoat from the sultan of ««Jd, In fact asked me to say that ha was a person acceptable to J l® Majesty 4 © OovBmvmt* I said this wae going a little too far as toUka best of my knowledge X had never seen Abdul Axlz AI Qaoalbi In ^y life and Imnw nothing about him* The time of th^ envoy•e d —.rture was drawing vory close whsn this miestlon was rulsod and I aald that,before T coul -1 g :ive wy kin^ c?' ofrlclal recognition, it would be n^ooseary for we to consult the Political Agont, Bahrain, as to the Quallfloatlono of nbdul a 35.12, on such rocos^raondat lens to forw my own judgoraant and submit my proposals to India and London for their approval which perhaps I rlf^.t then b* p^^ittod to convey to His Uighnee® the Sultan of Mejd# The norwai -md rvml'*r course would h* for His Highness ihe Sultan to addriss 7^© on tho subject* If, however, he felt unable to r^akr so complete a surrender, he could write rrivat«iy to Abdul Aziz A1 Qasalbi warning him not to transgress the limitations imposed on him by ais ^ajesty 1 s Oov^mment, when quite roe?»ibly, His ^t^hn^ss would find that Abdul kzi% would be allowed to consolidate his? position quietly and gr dually* •'hat was th^ very furthest I found myself in a position to concede. I could net do so officially or in vetting to the 3ultan, but I would write deml- oft ioiaiiy to ''ajor Daly on this subject. This letter, 'o«ll, closes the list of correspondence.

To His Highness Imam sir AT*'lul Aziz ibn Abdul Eataan al Faisal al Sa^d, Sultan of Hejd and Dependencies* A # C. My friend! It had occurred to both myself and the Political Agent, Bahrain, that it was -Dossible that Your Highness had not appreciated the full meaning of Sir Percy Cox f letter to Your Highness of the 19th /2lst a ^ril 1923, No. S # 0 ,/66?5, on the subject of a loan from the High Govemrent and the pecun iary assistance which the High Government has for many months been giving to Your Highness at the rate of £ 5,000 per month. We may be mistaken Jn this belief but, after a perusal of Sir Percy Cox* letter quoted above in the presence of your envoy, Syud Hashim, the latter, while he stated ex pressly that he had no information nor instructions on the subject, admitted that the Arabic rendering of a pagsage in that letter was not altogether clear and might lead to confusion. It is true that a close reading of the follow ing clause would anrjear to put the meaning beyond a doubt, as it certainly does in the English version but in order that there may b© no rossible misapprehension, I am directed to repeat what it was intended to convey in that, letter. The following are the passages of Sir Percy Cox* letter repeated verbatim. 'In any case owing to tl~c great financial stringency which I have referred to above His Majesty 1 a Government have instructed me to explain to Tour Highness that they must contemplate terminating the arrangement under which they give Your Highness pecuniary assistance to the extent ofof £ 5,000 per month but in terminating the arrangeTrtent they offer now to pay you durinja; this year £ 85,000 at onoe and another £ 85 ,000/- in six months• w The following is the exact meaning# 'The matter is no longer under contemDlation but the High GoTemmant has decided 9 in vir-w of the great finan cial stringency referred to above, they must terminate the arrangement under which they give Your Highness pecuniary assistance to the extent of tot £ 5 ,000 per month but in ter minating the arrangement they will pay Tour Highness in this year £ 85 ,000 at once and another £ 25,000 in six months and no further payments of any kind can be looked for** from this it is to be understood that the former arrangement with Your Highness has been finally mit an end to, but at the sme time I do not mean from this saying to im ^ly that the door of help has been finally closed between ^our Highness and the Great Govamment, for her clemency is open* The meaning is only that I should show to Your Highness, wit h the fullest clarity, the termination of previous arrangement#, since then £ 85,000 have been, so I learn from the 0 clxtical Agent, Bahrain, been ^aid to Your Highneas 1 agent in two instalments, one of £ 6,000 in May and a further £ 80,000 on the Bth June. u # e.

To The Hon' ble The Political Resident,Bashire. 3ir t I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch lo 349-S together with the documents attached thereto. As regards the proposal that the Sultan of Na f jd should be asked to recii/ve a friendly visit by aeroplane,! m of opinion that Bin ^aud would excuse himself from receiving such a mission on various grounds .He would be fully alive to the moral effect which such a visit would have upon his own gablaots.It would destroy at once that feeling of immunity from attack or reprisals by the armed forces of Great Britain,which it is his policy to encourage a belief in,&amp; would I think to some extent dimiinish his prestige with the beduin to whom, of course,he represents himself as invincinle. On the technical aspect I am not qualified to judge,but on the results of the recent trip to Bahrrin it would not seem feasible for aeroplanes, of the type which cam© here,to carry out this flight. The distance by air would be at least 250 miles trom Bah min making 500 for the trip. The hot weather,with the uncertain winds which occur here &amp; in the desert would not be a suitable time &amp; I would suggest that the cftld weather would be more suitable. Bven supposing Bin 3aud agreed to the visit,which I greatly doubt would be the c«s©,it would be highly desirable that there should oe no hitch in the proceedings,or all the moral effect for which the visit is planned might easily be dissipated. I vnuld suggest that advantage be taken,next cold weather, of Bin iauds visit to Hassa ( he always goes there for a few months) to suggest a visit the re. If he agrees { &amp; he would be more Ikely toagrea to this, then to a trip to Riyadh) the visit would be a comparatirely simple matter,It would have a good deal of moral aff«ot &amp; it would be a simple matter,during the visit,to enlarge on the ease with which he could be visited in Hiyadh^Should he then possibly agree,a visit could be mads,&amp; if he declines the fact that it was suggested as an easy matter vould not be lost on him. If he declines to receive a visit in H^ssa,we may be certain that he would be still more averse to aeroplanes goinp 'to Riyadh. It might however be possible {although^ we should expect a refusal) to reply to his excuses for not receiving a vist in Eassa by suggesting that perhaps it would be more convenient for him in Riyadh &amp; that the little difference in distance would be &amp; matter of indifference to the pilots,Although he would presumably again find excuses, it would h f ve thoroughly brought home to him the fact that we donsider him within striding d instance • It is just possible that he might accept that a visit should be pidd to Hassa &amp; once there his enthusiasm for aeroplanes might; induce him to agree to the more extended visit, especially if we offered to tais :e him back to Riyadh by air.In this case it might be pos ible,under guise of exaggerated precautions for his personal safety - comfort, t© send on a few spares or some petrol to Riyadh for erre rgencies, though it would be made cle r that this is not essontiel out out of special regard for his comfort in case at any slight mishap. I am inclined to thinlc that a dash for Riyadh { even if agreed to by Bin 3aud) without any sort of prepare ion,might end in diffioultie which would tend to discredit the power of aeroplanes which exists in the beduin mind. Whether,or not,my apprehension are justified would be known to aeronautical experts,but I do not think: m should ignore the unsatisfactory effect a failure would produce, I Hbve been asked by Air Hd Qrs Bighdad to obtain for them certain information sb out the route,which I have done to the besfc ot my ability, • I am fo warding you a copy of my letter by this mail.

Reference this office letter No, 247-S, dated 21st April 1924, and subsequent correspondence on the subject of the form of endorsement on Nejd passports. The Political Resident has decided that as the question of translating the terra 'Political Agent' into an Arabic phrase readily intelligible along the Arab Coast from Kuwait to Muscat presents difficulties, the best solution of the problem is to transliterate the words 'Political 4gent' into Arabic characters. In India such words as 'Deputy Commissioner' 'Collector' etc. are used freely in Urdu in their transliterated form, as also is the term 'Consul' on the Arab Coast. The translit- -oration of the term 'Political Agent' therefore, in the opinion of the Resident, constitutes no new departure from recognised custom in such matters on the Arab Coast or in India. I am to request you to amend both the English and Arabic versions of the endorsement by simply substitut- -ing the words 'Political Agent' for 'Consul'o ^ ^ ' Capt., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The following points were discussed 1. The control of future re^kt^ions with Ibn Saud and Channel of Communicatiorn Sir J. ShucKburgh pointed out tiiat hitherto the Foreign Office had dealt with the Hejaz and the Colonial Office with Nejd. He drew attention to t ,he recommendation made by the lister ton-Smith Committee 4hat the chaimel of communication between His Majesty's Government and the iiejaz Government should be the Foreign Office but that, in all^ questions affecting purely Arab politics, the Colonial Of!ice should be regarded as the responsible -British authority. He said that he had referred the question of the control ox mture KKXi relations with Ibn Saud to the Secretary of State and that Mr. Amery's views were as follows (a) Apart from questions ofl detail arising out of the Bahra Agreement with regard to which the High Comiriissloner for Iraq had already been authorised to deal direct with i.bn Saud through the British Agent at(Jeddah, all communications with Ibn Saud should pass through the Foreign Office and H.M. Consul at Jeddah. (b) the final responsibility for all questions affecting Arabian politics whether relating to the j-ejaz ot Kejd should rest withXthe Colonial Office. (c) the responsibility for ad^xjpiBXfcxiuts local and consular questions concerning the Hejaz. including the Pilgrimage should rest with*the Foreign Office. air J. bhuckburgh addedthat, in his opinion, the Foreign Office should also be primarily responsible in all matters concerning Ibn v^aud s relations with Foreign Powers. He explained that these proposals would, in practice, very largely mean the continuance of the present arrangements, except that the channel of communication via Bushire would be eliminated: although this channel ooula always be revived, either in addition to or instead of the Jeddah channel, in the case of necessity. i.ir. fepnng .-ic.e sai oiai. he agreed generally with the proposals but would have to Jefer them to higher authority. (iuestions of Arabian policy ..uUj.a as hitherto be dealt\ with by consultation between i-^e Office and the Colonial Office, tut the foreign Cftioe aoald » prefer not to lay down anythlhg definite until the fatarei?3 relations with Ibn Saud had been defined 'by the conclusion of a revised treaty. Sir J. Shuckburfah. said that he was sure that thete was no intention of altering the present arrangements under which action integard to Hejd or Hejaz affairs was concerted between the Foreign Office and^the Colonial Office, but that the view of the Secretary of State for the Colonies was that the Colonial Office should in principle be regarded as the Department primarily responsible for dealing with questions of policy in Arabia and therefore the Department whose view should normally prevail As regards the question who would deal with Parliamentary Questions relating to Ibn Saud, the general view of the Conference was that, in deference to Ibn Baud's expressed wish that his relationsfshould be with the foreign Office, such quest ion sjshoula normally be answered by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but that the Colonial Office should furnish the material for the replies. (2) Revision of the 1916 Treaty with Ibn Saud . Sir J. Shuckbur^h said that it was clear that the existing Treaty between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud was no longer appropriate ana would have to be xkxx revised. It was agreed that a polite message should be xk sent to Ibn Saud informing him that Sir G. Clayton had reported his desire for a revision of the Treaty: that His Majesty's Government realised that the circumstances had changed and that it was desirable to revise the treaty; and that a communication on the subject would be addressed to him very shortly. Mr Surinp Rice suggested that they new treaty snould contain as little detail as possible, and urged that as the whole negotiation oi the treaty must be largely a matter of tactics, it would be desirabxe before making any definite proposals to have the views of Sir G. Clayton who was already on the way back to .ngland from Aden. Subiect to this reservation, he proposed the undermentioned subjects as suitable for inclusion in the Treaty, and ^iiese were agreed to provisionally and subject to certain resei- vations shown in the notes. (a) declatation of perpetual peace and friendship (b) recognition by Ibn Saud of His MajestyAs Government 's special position in the neighbouring Mandated Territories. (c) agreement by Ibn Saud not to inter!ere with ivrab rulers with'whom H.M.G. were in treaty relations, e.g. (Note'. * It was agreed that the actual xex ralers ./hora thif should apply would have to be carefully considered.) (d) Settlement of the Trans- Jordan-Hejaz frontier. • (e) Something on the lines of Article 5 of the 1916 Treatv providing for the protection, etc., oi pilgrims. (Note. It was agreed that, it would be necessary oO consult the Government of India before any iorms of words could be put to Ibn Baud.) (f) promise by Ibn Saud to co -operate in the sup pression of the Slave Trade and to recognise the practice of consular manumission at Jeddah. It was agreed -that the question of retaining the substance of Article 2 of the present treaty (viz. pro tection against foreign agression) should be dlBCU8 ®® &lt; ^ h:^k t with Sir G. Clayton on his arrival. Grou^ Captain Burnett explained that the Air Ministry were definitely opposed to entering into any commitment to protect Ihn Saud. IC y. Wakely suggested that the treaty should be made with Ibn Saud personally and should not apply to his dynasty, and it was agreed that the (question of making the treaty personal to Ibn Saud or for a limited number of years ilb or for the duration of His Majesty's Government's mandatory responsibility in the Kiddle East would require further consideration. (3) Grant of a Subsidy. M jcx It was agreed that the payment of a subsidy to Ibn Saud was out of the question, and that this question should not be mentioned in any communication addressed to Ibn Saud. (4) Supply of Arms . Mr. Malle t pointed out that Ibn Saud 's request to Sir G. Clayton for arms was made before he had captured liledina and Jeddah, as a result of which considerable stores of arms and ainmunition passed into his possession. It was agreed that, although it might be advisable in the future to allow him to purchase in Great Britain arms for Governmental purposes, it would be undesirable to volunteer to do ax do at present. It was accordingly agreed that his request under this head should be ignored. (5) He^resentation in Damascu s. Mr. Spring Hicc said the Foreign Office proposed that British control over the Kejdi representative in Damascus should be allowed to go, by degrees, but that at the same time, the Consul should keep in personal touch with him.. It was agreed that Ibn Saud should be informed I] that the attention of His Majesty's Government had been called to the question and that they had taken his correspondence with £Sx Sir G. Clayton into consideration and have no objection to his entering into direct correspondence with the French authorities in Syria through -is representative at Damascus. 6. Arraneme nts for '^ i l ^.r imane . It was agreed that ohe foreign Office should telegraph to the British Consul at Jeddah asking him how far he was in a position to meet Ibn Saud 's request for an early estimate of the total number of pilgrims likely to perform the pilgrimage this year and whether he wished H.M.G. to take steps to obtain further information to supplement that already in his possession. 7. Ue.idi dele^ation^o India. It was decided that in wri oing to Ibn Saud it should be pointed out that this matter had now been satisfactorily disposed of in accordance with his wisnes. 8. Senussi. It was agreed that no action should be tatcen on aikno communication made to Ibn Saud with feierence -o h ® intercession on behalf of the Senussi, pending ohe xtx rt^ur of Sir G. Clayton who had promised to make enquiries m Cairo. 9. Harbou r at P :ar. '.'annura . As Sir 0. Clayton had ™ , take up the matter with the authorities in Bombay, it was to await his return before considering what action was possible on this, and that in the meantime no communication on -he subject should be made to Ibn baud. 10. Beliml i tiation of Trans -Jurd an frontier,, 14 ^ ^'® e lg hat the delimitation on the spot of the frontier laiadown i u- Hadda Agreement should he deferred an til the ne * ' Ibn Saud had been concluded, when it aould ^posBibleto arrange for the delimitation oi the whole 0 ' ' . , Mandated frontier between Ibn Saua's territories territory to be carried out as one operation. t^' pointed out, however, that the Foreign ' 0 have the frontier settled as there had b «® n °L oritieB frontier infringements on the part oi bo-h ui , i -i in Syria and of Ibn Saud.Enclosure in foreign Office covering letter dated 7th April 1926.

His Majesty's Government therefore willihe prepared to discuss the question of treaty revision and hope shortly to address a further communication on the subject to Ibn Saud. The attention of His Majesty's Government .has also been drawn to the correpondence betv/een Ibn Saud and Sir G. Clapton regarding the protection of Najdian interests in Damascus by His Majesty's Consul. They do not desire to raise any objection to His Majesty' entering into direct communication with the French authorities in Syria through he Najdian representative there. With regard to prpposed Najdian delegation to India ( see Clayton report page 46) you should explain that matter has now been satisfactorily settled in accordance with Ibn Saud's wishes.mMFIDKH TIAX .

Government and The King of the Heja* and of l^ejd).[This Document is the Property of Hit Britannic Majesty's Government. EASTERN (Arabia) CONFIDENTIAL. [E 2582/119/91] [Amended Copy.] No. 1. Sir G. Clayton to Sir Austen Chamberlain. Sir, Foreign Office, June 6, 1927. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on my recent mission to Jeddah for the purpose of negotiating a treaty with the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd. Journey to Port Sudan. 2. I left London on the 15th April, 1927, for Marseilles, where I embarked on the Bibby Line steamship ' Lancashire,' arriving at Port Sudan on the 24th April. I was accompanied from London by Mr. S. R. Jordan, and Mr. G. Antonius joined the mission at Port Said on the 21st April. Delay in proceeding to Jeddah. 3. On arrival at Port Sudan I received a telegram from His Britannic Majesty's consul at Jeddah informing me that Ibn Saud was not expected in Mecca before the 4th May. I therefore decided that Mr. Jordan should proceed to Jeddah in H.M.S. ' Dahlia ' on the following day, while I remained for a few days in Port Sudan, accompanied by Mr. Antonius. I considered this arrangement desirable as I did not wish the mission to risk losing dignity by waiting about at Jeddah and affording material for local gossip and intrigue. Journey to Jeddah. 4. On the 1st May I embarked with Mr. Antonius in H.M.S. 'Dahlia' (Com mander Cotton, R.N.), arriving on the following morning at Jeddah, where I was received with due ceremony by the Hejazi authorities and conducted to His Britannic Majesty's consulate. Arrival of Ihn Saud in Jeddah and Reception of Mission, 5. The arrival of Ibn Sand in Mecca was still further delayed until the 7th May, and he did not reach Jeddah until the morning of the 9th May, on the afternoon of which dav the mission was received in audience by the King. Ihe meeting was restricted'to the usual exchange of greetings and compliments, and was marked by great cordialitv and friendliness on the part of the King, who insisted that the mission should leave the consulate and occupy a house on the outskirts of Jeddah which he caused to be prepared for its reception. Initiation of Negotiations. 6. On the following day conversations began, and are given in detail in a subsequent despatch. Main Points at issue. 7. It was evident from the results of the conversations at Wadi-al-'Aqiq, conducted in December last by Mr, Jordan and Mr. Antonius, that the mam questions at issue were— {a.) Recognition of the special position of His Majesty's Government in mandated territories. (b.) Mutual recognition of national status. (c.) Retention of the right of manumission of slaves by His Majesty's consular officers. (d.) The Hejaz-Transjordan frontier. The first two questions appeared to present no difficulty, as His Majesty's Government had consented to meet Ibn Saud s point of view m both cases. It was to be anticipated, however, that the requirements of His Majesty s Government in respect of manumission and the Hejaz—'Iransjordan frontier would meet with strenuous opposition, and this forecast proved to be correct 5 indeed, at the close of the sixth meeting agreement was not yet in sight. 4004 [16248] [16350] B{ ! fi i; Private Interview with Ihn Saud—and his Attitude. 8. At this stage, however, Ibn Saud requested a private and personal interview with me, at which matters came to a head. He assured me that he appreciated full the reasons for the attitude taken up by His Majesty's Government, and beo^ed me to believe that it was his earnest wish to meet their wishes in every possible'wav • h was, however, in a very delicate position, especially in regard to the Hejaz -Transfordan frontier, and to sign the protocol at the present juncture would be to expose himself to violent criticism not only by his enemies, but also by his friends; moreover, lie had many difficulties to contend with in his task of consolidating the position which he had won, and he could not afford to undermine his own prestige or do anything to alienate his friends and strengthen his enemies. In conclusion, somewhat to my surprise, he said that he had now come to me, as a trusted friend, to ask my frank and impartial opinion as to his best course of action, and was prepared to accept and act upon mv advice. ^ Sir G. Clayton's Advice to Ihn Saud. , , I that His Majesty s Government had decided that they must retain the right of manumission and were also determined to maintain the Hejaz -Transjordan frontier as defined in the draft protocol. Unless these two points were adequately safeguarded, no treaty was possible, and I had no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, a rupture would react very unfavourabl3 ,, on his interests and those of his country. I strongly advised him, therefore, to meet the wishes of His Majesty's Government. Ibn Saud accepted my advice, and appealed to me to find a way in which the requirements of His Majesty's Government could be met with the minimum of injury to his own position and prestige. Slave Traffic, 10. I did not feel able to suggest any solution of the question of the slave trade other than that of the insertion in the body of the treaty of an article by which jn baud would undertake to co-operate, as far as practicable, in its suppression, supplemented by an exchange of letters making it clear that His Majesty's Government would continue to exercise the right of manumission by their consular officers. Frontier Question, ( l lies ^ 0 &gt; n of the frontier, however, required fuller consideration. I could, peihaps, have induced Ibn Saud at that stage to sign the protocol, and I felt it very desirable to reach a definite settlement without delay. On the other hand, his arguments against this course were cogent, and it was obviously undesirable to force mm into a really difficult position ; moreover, I was convinced that it would be better, ^ in terests of future co-operation and good relations, to ensure that the treaty should be signed in a spirit of real amity and confidence than to leave behind me a feeling that it had been concluded in an atmosphere of coercion as opposed to one of mutual agreement. Exchange of Letters re Frontier Question. • ]2. I theiefore decided in favour of a solution on the lines of paragraph 11 of my instructions, and informed Ibn Saud that, while still maintaining that signature of the diaft protocol was the most satisfactory course to follow, I was ready to accept an exchange of letters such as would recognise adequately the position which His lajesty s Government had decided to maintain. Ibn Saud held by his promise to -accept my advice on both points, and went as far as to say that, if I would draft the necessary letters, he would sign them, an understanding which he duly fulfilled. Question of Nationality and Tribunals. 13. Agreement now appeared to have been reached on all the more contemious questions and it only remained for Mr. Antonius and Ibn Sand's advisers to settle vanous^ minor points in sub-committee and to draw uj) the final draft. During the discussions m sub-committee, however, an unexpected difficulty arose. Ibn Saud's acviseis tried by all possible means to extend the scope of article 6 in such a manner as to involve a complete renunciation of the Capitulations by His Majesty's Govern- ment, and tmaily they informed Mr. Antonius that the King would be unable to sign le rea y unless I agreed to renounce the Capitulations or, at least, to inform him in writing that His Majesty s Government would raise no objection if he w^ere to abolish them by proclamation. yt; forJtM L0 ; li Hr. A Dt ^tijiaiid Sheik it trans isfflofNegotiations at a Deadlock on the Question of Capitulations. 14 I saw Ibn Sand the next morning and, finding that his advisers had described the situation correctly, I informed him categorically that I was unable to accede to his demand. He remained firm and insisted that he could sign no treaty unless the jurisdiction of his courts was fully recognised in all cases, both civil and criminal, and in regard to foreigners as well as natives. I urged that His Majesty's Government had already made a great concession in article 6 and begged him to reflect before he wrecked the treaty by persisting in a demand to which it was beyond my power to accede ; but he refused to give way and a rupture appeared almost inevitable. Solution of the Capitulations Difficulty. 15. Mr. Antonius then had one more private interview with Dr. Abdullah Damluji and Sheikh Hafez Wahba in the hope of finding some solution at the eleventh hour, and it transpired at length that there had been a misunderstanding and some confusion of ideas in the King's mind. Article 6, far from being regarded as a concession, had given rise to grave suspicion in the minds of Ibn Saud's advisers, who interpreted it as an attempt to obtain recognition of the principle of Capitulations under the guise of a concession in regard to a specific portion of them. They had communicated their suspicions to the King, who, having hitherto maintained the attitude of ignoring the existence of Capitulations altogether, immediately became alarmed and took up an extreme attitude. Conclusion and Signature of Treaty. 16. The situation was now clear and Ibn Saud's advisers, having been reassured as to the intention of His Majesty's Government, suggested that the elimination of the offending article and the addition of a vague, and I consider innocuous, sentence at the end of article 5 would probably secure agreement. I saw the King the next morning and proposed this solution, to which he agreed at once. The final text Avas then prepared and the treat}' was duly signed and the letters exchanged on the evening of the 20th May, at the conclusion of a dinner which the King gave in honour of the mission. The texts are enclosed herein. Questions outside the Scope of Treaty, 17. I will now explain the action taken in regard to certain questions which are dealt with in my instructions, but which do not fall within the compass of the treaty. Position of Iraq. 18. In paragraph 6 of my letter of instructions I was directed to explain to Ibn Saud the position of the Iraq Government and to proceed to an exchange of notes recognising that, while Iraq is outside the scope of the treaty, His Majesty s consular officers in the Hejaz and Nejd may afford protection to Iraqis in those temtones so long as Iraq does not herself maintain representatives there. Postponement of Iraq Question. 19. I had intended to deal with this question after conclusion of the negotiations, and I did not anticipate that it would give rise to any difficulty. Unfortunately the question of nationality and that of tribunals, dealt with in aitides 5 and 6 of the diaft treaty, had produced a very acute situation, and I was convinced that if I laibed the question of Iraq I should once more provoke grave, even though unfounded, suspicion and probablv wreck the treaty irretrievably. I therefore decided that it was necessary to postpone the question for the present. It is a question of fact and not of negotiation, and can properlv be communicated through the usual official channels to the Go\einment of the Hejaz and of Nejd at some convenient time, possibly when the exchange of ratifications takes place. Bejaz Nationality Law. 20. Dor similar reasons I thought it unwise to discuss the objections put forward bv His Majesty's Government to certain articles in the Hejaz Nationality Law, promulgated on the 29th September, 1926. The matter is not one of immediate urgency, and will be better dealt with by His Majesty s consul at Jeddah after the treaty has been ratified. [16248] E 2 i ■i - if i ' 1 • ihr _ v ■Removal of Embargo on Import of Arms* 21. I explained to Ibn Saud that His Majesty's Government were of opinion that the supply of arms was a question which could not properly be dealt with in the body of the main treaty. This question has been made the subject of an exchange of letters between Ibn Sand and myself on the lines laid down in my instructions. Hejaz Hallway. 22. Ibn Saud raised the question of the Hejaz Railway, and T informed him that, for practical reasons, it had not been possible to give effect to his request that the railway should be put in order for this year's pilgrimage; but His Majesty's Govern ment were discussing the matter with the French Government with a view to the necessary steps being taken to secure the reopening of the railway in time for the pilgrimage of 1928. The King, after expressing the earnest hope that every effort would be made to secure the operation of the railway before next year's pilgrimage, asked to be given, as soon as possible, a statement of the situation up to date, and to be kept fully informed as to the progress of negotiations. He added that he presumed that he would be given the opportunity of nominating a representative to the conference which must be held with a view to arranging a final settlement, and asked to be furnished, in good time, with all the details and information necessary for a thorough study of the question. Awqaf-el-Har amain, 23. I discussed with the King the question of the Awqaf-el-Haramain, and explained to him that it was contrary to the invariable principle of His Majesty's Government to interfere in religious matters or in the decisions of religious, or even of civil, courts. His Majesty's Government, therefore, regretted that they did not see their way to exerting any influence to assist him in obtaining the revenues of Wakfs, which he maintained should be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the sanctuaries of Islam at Mecca and Medina. Ibn Saud replied that he appreciated and respected His Majesty's Government's point of view, but he thought that his request for assistance in this matter had perhaps been misunderstood. He had no wish to ask His Majesty's Government to interfere in religious matters or in the operation of courts, either religious or civil. He proposed to apply through the proper channels for those Wakf revenues which he considered should be paid over to him, and, if necessary, to bring actions before the competent tribunals. All he asked of His Majesty's Government was that they should help him, as far as possible, to obtain justice in cases where unfair influence might be exerted against him and his claims unjustl} 7 ' blocked by refusal to furnish necessary information or by other methods. He asked that His Majesty's Government should reconsider his request in the light of these explanations, and make a further communication to him as soon as possible. He also requested that he might be assisted by being furnished with— (a.) Information as to what Awqaf-el-Haramain existed in India. (6.) Advice as to the proper steps to take with a view to preferring and establishing such claims as he might wish to make. (c.) I he normal measure of guidance and assistance to any delegation which he might decide to send to India, or elsewhere, for the purpose of making enquiries and preferring claims. Departure from Jeddah and Return to England. 24. On the 21st May the mission paid an official farewell visit to the King and then embarked on the Italian steamship 'Nasario Sauro,' arriving at Suez on the morning of the 24th May and proceeding to Cairo on the same day. Five days were spent in Egypt in liquidating the business of the mission, and on the 29th May I embarked in the P. and 0. steamship ' Ranpura,' accompanied by Mr. Jordan, arriving in London, via Marseilles, on the 4th June. Mr. Antonius remained in Egypt and returned thence to Jerusalem. Thanks to Local Authorities. 25. I cannot close this report without placing on record the extreme kindliness of our reception by the King and all the officials of his Government with whom we came in contact. Everything possible was done for our comfort and convenience, and the negotiations were carried out in an atmosphere of extreme friendliness and good humour.5 Staff. 26. In conclusion, I dcsne to testify to the services rendered, by my colleugues on the mission, Mi. S. R. Jordan and Mr. Gr. Antonins, whose previous work at adi-al- Ac[io[ was of great assistance m clearing the ground and enabling me to form a just appreciation of the situation. Mr. Jordan afforded me valuable help at all times and placed his local knowledge and experience unreservedly at my disposal. I have had occasion, in connection with previous missions to the Hejaz and the Yemen, to bring the services of Mr. Antonius to the favourable notice of His Majesty's Government, and will only add now that his intimate knowledge of Arab language and psychology, combined with a clear understanding of the questions at issue, was quite invaluable and contributed in no small measure to the results achieved. I have, &amp;c. GILBERT CLAYTON. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Treaty with the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd.
