I think that the Viceroy had probably already seen copies of your correspondence with the U.S.Embassy which we recently sent to Caroe for his most secret and confidential infomation and I doubt, therefore, whether there is much further that we can say to him at the moment in reply. You will notice, however, what the Viceroy says about the difficulty being caused by the delay in arriving at a decision* P Husain is indeed a very senior official whom India can ill spare and/Secret Oypher telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 31st July, 1944. 16776 Personal, fbn Saud recently appealed urgently to British and American Governments fa economic and financial aid. It v/as therefore decided to hold discussions between British and American authorities in Washington and an agree ment v/as reached on a joint programme. It was decided that our assistance to Ibn Saud should be expressed in goods and not in cash. The King is expected to obtain revenue by the sale of these goods. 2. Joint instructions have now been sent to K.f.. and U.S. Ministers at Jedda to make communication to Ibn Saud on following lines: (a) A joint subsidised supply programme for 1944 has been prepared by M.E. Supply Centre, the aim of which is to maintain a three months' supply of cereals, tea and sugar in Saudi Arabia at all times; (b) Total expense of this programme is to be shared in equal measure by American and British Governments regardless of countries of origin of supplies. (c) British and American Governments will endeavour to supply Saudi Arabia with sufficient motor vehicles and spare parts to meet essential transportation needs. A number oftrucks have already been or shortly will be delivered. (d) It is to be emphasised to Ibn Saud that supply programme for 1944 contemplates that he will sell an increased proportion of goods supplied tohim. As Oil Company operations expand and as pilgrimage traffic increases with improved war situation British and American Governments will expect Saudi Arabia to become increasingly self-supporting. (e) British and American Governments regard it as essential that they should be supplied with fullest possible statistics regarding supply and consumption m Saudi Arabia to enable them to estimate what help was required. 3. Minister of State, Mr. Law, who is visiting Washington, reports that he has found British authorities there concerned with handling all Middle East questions considerably encouraged by signs of trust and confidence shown by Americans in Saudi Arabian discussions. They believe that American attitude is clear evidence that Wallace Murray discussions in London are bearing fruit.Ccvy A ^ - 4x01/ d'^o/kib ) XO tti J aly , x'sf^ M&amp;ny then/.s for your letter of t lie 7th July regarding the euviserehipe in oauui , rabia. should nave been Very willing to consider the b«eis which the ^ ate Department have pul forward for a joint appro;^oh uo Ibn.oauo if that basis aid not itself rest on what seems to us false premises. 1 refer more particularly to the statement contained in the fourth paragraph of your letter vi*.

If we turn to tht future, it seemn certain that the Saudi Arabian income from its oil resources will increase andi indeeu, we hope it v.ili be so.

A Christian financial adviser will certainly find difficulties, in obtaining information ana in getting hie advice accepted, which will not apply to the same extent to a Moslem. I think experience in other Middle hast countries shows conclusively that unless the local officials co-operate whole-heartedly it is very hard for a foreign adviser to make effective progress., Xir^Ofort as both you and we wist for improved financial conditions in baudi Arabia it still seems to us more practical to give Ibn baud the sort of adviser he wants. I should be grateful if you would bring the above to the notice of tne State Department. ( igned) Maurice Peterson.COPY (S 4063/325/25) Smbassy of the United States of America 1 Grosvenor Square, London, W.l. 7 July, 1944. Dear Sir Maurice: I have been aslced to convey the gratification of the Department of State that you have expressed in your letter of June 8 (No. K 3025/325/25) 1944, reiterated assurance of adherence to the agreed principle that the larger financial and supply problems of Saudi Arabia ought to be dealt with as far as possible on a joint basis in consul tation between our two Governments. The support to which you refer accorded to Dr. Mill- spaugh by British officials in Iran is fully appreciated. It may be recalled, however, that Dr. Millspaugh's Mis sion was formed at the suggestion of the British Govern ment as well as upon the request of the Iranian Govern ment to cope with special conditions arising out of the war. The situation in Iran, therefore, for this and other reasons does not appear to be entirely analogous to that prevailing in Saudi Arabia. In considering Saudi Arabian matters both our Govern ments, I believe, are seeking a solution of long range ' problems which will safeguard our respective interests in that country. It is recognized that the Near East, in which there are many British Moslem subjects, is an area of primary British military operational responsibility. For this reason, the Department of State, in conjunction with the War Department, signified its approval of the Foreign Office 1 s suggestion that a joint Military Mission be sent to Saudi Arabia under the leadership of a British officer of Anglo-Saxon extraction. This approval, however, was made contingent upon the understanding that any financial or economic Mission which might be sent to Saudi Arabia should be headed by an American. By this reference was meant any Mission of a financial or economic character or any expert or experts furnished by either the American or British Government for the purpose of advising the Saudi Arabian Government with respect to financial or economic matters. In making this suggestion the Department had in mind particularly the request for a financial adviser reported to have been made last March by King Ibn Baud. It was contemplated, therefore, that if but one adviser should be furnished he should be an American and that, if he should be provided with an assistant, such assistant should be British, or, if with several assistants, they should be of mixed nationality. The reason it was proposed that the head of any financial mission or that a single financial adviser furnished to the Saudi Arabian Government be an American is that the preponderant interest in Saudi Arabian econ omy is unquestionably American in character and will presumably remain so for many years to come. As you know, the principal economic resource of Saudi Arabia is Sir Maurice Peterson, K.C.j .C. , C.M.G., Foreign Office, s.:.1. its/its petroleum reserves. As you know also, the concession to develop these reserves ie held by an American company. Inevltv'Vly, therefore, the economy of Baud! Arabia will be based At^jn oil produced as the result of substantial American capital investments. For this reason it is considered that the question does not arise as to which party may have a preponderant economic and financial interest in Baudi Arabia at such time as a financial mission might well be formed. Saudi Arabia*s traditional commercial relations with neighboring British countries, however, must be taken into consideration. ?hus it is sincerely hoped that satisfactory arrangements may be worked out to &lt;3ftal jointly with the larger Saudi Arabian financial and supply problems. Of course, with respect to furnishing advisers we must be guided by the wishes of King Ibn Baud. However, I think you will agree that, if our Governments are to support the Saudi Arabian economy through the extension of joint material aid, it would not appear unreasonable to suggest that King ibn Baud have the benefit of the advice of qualified experts as to the manner in which thia aid is utilize*:. Advice of this kind not only would contribute to the implementation of our plans for the extension of joint assistance but alno undoubtedly would prove helpful to the Saudi Arabs themselves. It might be well, therefore, to ask the King whether he is agreeable to our suggestions; namely, that he avail himself of the services of a joint Military Mission headed by a British officer of Anglo-Saxon extraction and of an American financial adviser to function either singly or as head of a joint financial mission. To demonstrate to him our co operative approach toward the solution of oftudi Arabian problems, it it proposed that our respective re resentativea at Jidda be instructed to visit King Ibn Baud together in order to make these suggestions to him. In the event that you i*eel you cannot concur in this proposal, my Government may contemplate instructing the American representative to visit the King to ascertain his views regarding the adviser question. If it should appear that the location of the Treasury at fcecca presents complications, an inquiry might be made as to the possibility of transferring the Treasury elsewhere. At least, such a transfer should not present many physical or transportation difficulties. However, if this should not prove feasible, it is believed that a foreign financial adviser could function ffectively with respect to matters of policy at Jidda, the port of Mecca. It ie hoped that we shall be able soon to formulate detailed plans for dealing with Saudi Arabian financial and supply problems on a joint and cooperative basis, and that our representatives In Jidda may be instructed to discuss the adviser question with King Ibn Baud in the near future. .

His influence would naturally depend on his own initiative and capacity. We do not think there would be any analpgy with functions performed by Miljspaugh Mission in Persia and it would seem advisable vis-a-vis Americans that this should be avoided. \l K O-o r*l\ ^L, 3.. Regarding (b) when making his request for a financial expert to Jordan the King stated specifically that expert would report direct to him and have direct access whenever required* Jordan considers Zaid Husein*s qualifications would ensure full use being made of him by the King, But he would naturally work with and through Finance Minister who Jordan hopes would be changed. 4, As regards (c) in view of the fact that the financial adviser would be a servant of the King it would not be advisable to raise too precisely his relations with His Majesty s Government s representative. These we suggest can best be kept on a personal and unofficial basis. Same relations appear to exist with American Minister so long as latter and British Minister are in full co-operation. 5, Regarding (d) Ibn Saud' envisages expert being assisted by four or five ’ , hclps ,, of expert's own choosing. Ibn Saud &gt; would not object to expert being accompanied by sccrbtarv but interpreter could be provided locally. o consider Husein if he accepts post should visit Saudi Arabia as soon as possible to establish contact and to see for himself what should be done. He could then return to India to make further arrangements. 7-, Jordan does not think there will be any difficulty about arranging a salary of about £4,000 without Ir^omc Tax.

T 7e have discussed with Raisman and there is no doubt that Government of India . ; proposal is better than we ha.d dared to hope and that Zahid Hussaim should be an extremely valuable adviser if Ibn Baud will make full use of him. 2. We have not yet succeeded in persuading the Americans to agree to appointment of a British subject for this ‘purpose. Assuming that we succeed in this, we think that we should make i it clear to Government of India that the Adviser will have to i start almost from scratch in creating order out of chaos and r l that the iob will involve a good deal of uphill improvisation. We think that powers should certainly cover revenue currency and ways and means in addition to expenditure side, but should not at present be expanded on analogy of Millspaugh Mission. It would be desirable that Financial Adviser should exercise his own powers but we are not sure that this will be possible. He should certainly have direct access to Ibn Saud. It will no doubt be essential that he should maintain relations with United States Minister as nearly as possible parallel to those with you. 5. We should appreciate your comments on the above and on any further points you think can be dealt with in reply to Government of India. 5.

May, communicating we su'ostance of a telegram from the St^t^ 'Bepartaecit concerning milita^ and financial advisers to Saudi Arabia. I note that the State Department accept the suggestion v/e made to Mr. Wallace Murray that we should pr^eose to Ibn Saud a joint British American Military Mission to Saudi Arabia with a British officer at the head, but that the State Department^ approval .is subject to the condition that any economic or financial mission that may be sent to that country at the request of Ibn Saud should be headed by an American. t I think I should let you know that our latest information indicates that it may be very difficult to persuade Ibn Saud to accept any Christian officers at all. Should this prove to be the case, we will consult with the State Department whether it is better for us to supply Moslem officers only, or whether the whole idea of a military mission should be dropped. I think^ that our conversations in London showed conclusively that in this matter our interests and the American interests run entirely parallel and we shall discuss it with you with complete frankness. I presume that the condition regarding an economic or financial mission does not apply to the request which Ibn Saud made to us last March to be provided with a Sunni Moslem financial adviser to help him with expert advice in re-organising his country*s finances? (It is apparently essential that the financial expert shall be a Moslem owing to the Saudi Arabian Treasury, where he will have to work, being situated in Mecca). There has not yet been any question of an economic or financial mission being sent to Saudi Arabia sof ar as we know, and I am not quite sure how far such a proposal would meet with Ibn Saud 1 3 approval. But if and when the question of sending an economic mission arises, we should be inclined to agree that the leadership of it should be determined according to which party has the preponderant interest in Saudi Arabian economy and finance at the time. As you will recall, we agreed with Mr. Wallace Murray that ’’the larger financial and supply problems of Saudi Arabia ought to be dealt with as far as possible on a joint basis in consultation between the two Governments.” We entirely adhere to this. I hope you will agree, moreover, that we can each support the experts which either of us select for these important places where we have joint interests, and car have confidence in their willingness to further our common interests. We for our part have, as Mr. Wallace Murray recognised, done everything in our power to support Dr. Millspaugh and make the Persians understand that he and his staff have our full and entire confidence. Similarly we trust that when the Middle East Supply Centre send a representative to Jedda (I understand that Colonel Coneybeare an Americai, is their latest appointment) he may count on the assistance of both our Legation - and that he may correspondingly be counted upon to further the joint * interests of both our countries. The same considerations should, I think, apply to the work of any British or American experts whom our two Governments may agree to send to advise Ibn Saud. Would you very kindly communicate this reply to the State Department? If, as I hope, we can agree on this basis then we will send the necessary instructions to our Minister in Jedda. I should like if I may to refer to another matter concerning Saudi Arabia as I am writing to you on the subject. I hear that,there is a rumour in the Middle East that His Majesty’s Government, through their « representatives at Jedda, themselves suggested to Ibn Saud that he migtf* make this stipulation about the financial adviser and the officers bein* Sunni Moslems, with the ob.iect of_ restricting the choice to British Howard Bucknell, United States Embassy, ttCs. subjects,/I &gt; subjects, and to cut out the Americans. T should like to say that the -State Department may he categorically ass-ured that this rumour, into which we have enquired, is absolutely unfounded. The proposal originated spontaneously from Ibn Saud, without any prompting from Mr. Jordan, or any other British source, and we have reason to believe that Ibn Saud feels strongly on the subject. I feel that in this question of advisers we have to consicer not only American and British interests but also Ibn Saud f s own position. He has to be extremely careful not to expose himself to criticism to the effect that he, as guardian of the Holy ’Places of Islam and as leader of one of the strictest Moslem sects, has come under foreign influence ana has accepted Christians to administer.his affairs. I am sure the State Department will agree that we shall have to be careful to handle these questions of advisers in a way which will not lower Ibn Saud 1 s prestige amongst his own people.

I do not consider that Ihn Saud will welcome joint Anglo-American Military Mission containing Christian elements and any effort to press for acceptance of such a mission may provoke him to abandon the idea and he may later employ Moslem Mercenaries whose activities might well be -inimical to interest of both United States and ourselves He appears intent on re-organising Saudi Army but only with Moslem assistance and with British Moslem assistance for preference. Such a mission composed of well chosim officers would appear to be in best interest of both United States and ourselves. 5. You are aware he is extremely sensitive to criticism by his Hashimi and other Moslem enemies and endeavours to avoid giving them cause for criticism where possible. Moreover, once his enemies can assert with any justification that he, guardian of the Holy Places of Islam, has come under foreign influence, he will lose much of his present prestige and be of considerably less value and assistance to us and to Americans from a political point of view. 4. Since Americans admit our predominant political and military interests in Saudi Arabia it appears illogical for them to press for a joint ^i.s^ion composed of some Christian elements and I sugge c , that their insistence arised from their ignor^noo of his special position in the Moslem world. u - ^ jV 5. We have never endeavoured to ’’horn in” on their oil enterprises nor on agricultural assistance which they are giving to Ibn Saud at El Hari where many United States engineers are employed and, as an absolute fifty- fifty division of effort in Saudi Arabia is impossible of application, I recommend they be invited to drop their interests in Military Mission against a promise on our part to leave oil and agricultural development in their hands. 6 .

Id Both questions were discussed by the Foreign Office with the Stettinius Mission when they were here (see the minutes flagged below / , The result of these discussions as regards Military Advisers is summarised in Foreign Office telegram to Jedda No.58-briefly ; to-the effect that the suggestion of a joint mission composed partly of Sunni Muslim officers and partly of American officers was to be considered by the U. S. ;» r ar Department and Mr. Murray in America. Hiis has now been done and the U. S. Government’s reply is contained in the letter from the U. S. Embassy of the 2nd Iday at EXT. 2155/2*4. It is to the effect that the U. S. Government agree to the suggestion of a joint military mission provided that the financial mission to be sent to Xbn Saud is headed by an American. The Foreign Office regard the condition regarding the Financial Adviser as not at all satisfactory and are proposing to take up the point with the Americans. U. It 'is not clear how the Foreign Office are going to get over the difficulty arising from the fact that Ibn Saud has pai ticularly asked for Sunni Muslims both as Military and Financial Advisers. Ibn Saud has made it quite clear to H.M.Minister that he does not want Americans, and he recently emphasised his desire for Muslim oxTicers to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East (see Jedda telegram No.158 of the 10th May). So far as Saudi Arabia is concerned it is certainly unfortunate if H.M.G. are to be placed in the position of asking Ibn Saud to accept Americans against his own wishes. Art T iT OJh*. The Government of India are pursuing their searches for a Muslim Financial Adviser (our telegram No.10529 gives the latest position).

This is satisfactory enough as far as the military advisers are concerned, but you will see that the Americans wish to insist that the head of any economic or financial mission should be an American citizen. This does not fit in with our views at all, and we think our best course would be to ask the Embassy to take the , matter up with Wallace Murray on his return and try to get him to see why the financial adviser must be provided by us. Wq could point out in the first place that the Americans-seem to have got hold of the wrong idea about what is wanted. It is not a question of an economic or financial mission, but of a financial adviser who would, we hope, bring order into the chaotic u audi-Arabian finances. As his work would largely lie in Mecca, it is essential that he should be a Sunni Moslem. Moreover, as we are providing the bulk of the assistance to Saudi Arabia, to the tune of several million pounds yearly, we attach the greatest importance to the financial adviser being a British subject, who would take guidance from us. We think an impossible position would be created if the control over the expenditure of the large sums provided by us were put in the hands of a financial adviser who might have quite N.E.

We might add as a sop, if you agree, that we have no intention of building up a financial ^ mission round the Moslem adviser in the sense e. g., , of what has been done by the Americans in Persia: and that, if a visiting'mission seems necessary or desirable, we should readily agree to let an American head it. Perhaps you will let us know if you agree with the line .proposed and if you have any suggestions for further arguments which we could use with Wallace Murray.COPY 2702/325/25) j r j V, Ws - *r .jy K : I '.h *th the ComohmehiL- - ,, f* tor e* ary ofj StaJM - aeign ArfejifF Dear Sir Maurice,^ &gt;2 i 5 5 Erobassy of the United States of America*, 1, O r osvenor Square, London, 7.1.

K. Anderson, E India Office q *' !NDi/. ICESaudi Arabia. Sir M. Peterson said that we were anxious to correlate our efforts with those of the American Government. It seemed particularly important, both from the British and the American point of view, that this should be done in financial questions if the present confusion was to be remedied. He outlined our strong political and economic interest in Saudi Arabia, in view of its strategic position, trade with India, the pilgrimage, Ibn Sand’s position among the Arabs and in the Moslem world generally, &amp;c. Sir M. Peterson said that we freely recognised that the Americans had an important and growing interest in the oil industry. He recalled that in a recent telegram President Roosevelt had told Mr. Churchill that there was a fear in some quarters that we were trying to “ horn in.” He could assure Mr. Wallace Murray that we had a completely clear conscience in this respect. He had personally told the Saudi Arabian princes when they were here that we recognised the American interest in oil and that they should go ahead and do business with the Americans in that respect. Mr. Wallace Murray said that there had never been any misapprehension in the State Department so far as the v horning in suggestion was concerned. The American interest in Saudi Arabian oil was similar to our strategic and naval interest in Persian oil, and he could say for his part that the American Govern ment had no intention of “horning in” on that. He thought that the apprehensions had sprung up from the growing concern in the United States over possible oil shortage, which had necessarily had many political repercussions, particularly in election year. Mr. Wallace Murray repeated that Saudi Arabia was of great economic interest and importance to the United States, who certainly intended to develop the oil industry there. Certainly, the two countries were destined to have a closer relationship than ever before. Relations were so far very friendly. He added that the princes had had no discussions whatever regarding oil during their visit to the United States. Saudi A rabian Finance. Mr. Pinsent then outlined briefly the financial problem in Saudi Arabia. He explained that His Majesty’s Government had so far been providing— (1) The cost of Saudi Arabian diplomatic missions (this was a small item); (2) Goods ordered through the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation] Gellatly Hankey, &amp;c., as approved by the Middle East Supply Centre; and (3) Silver and gold coin. The United States had also provided 15 million silver rials on Lease-Lend and we had recently heard that they were considering whether to provide an extra5 °(Ljnillion rials in silver. Our subsidy had amounted in 1940 to close on £400,000, last year it had amounted to over £3,800,000. This was the cost to ourselves and the value to Ibn Saud was substantially greater. It seemed to us that both Governments should not give financial assistance on a large scale to Ibn Saud unless our efforts were correlated. Wallace Murray agreed with this general view. He said that he recognised that if silver and gold were given to Ibn Saud, they did not produce any revenue, and a scheme could possibly be worked out by means of which revenue would be provided for Ibn Saud. Mr. Pinsent said that he thought we might possibly work out a new plan of assistance by which help would be given by His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government, according to the quantities of goods supplied from the sterling area or from the dollar area. He understood that Saudi Arabia was eligible for credit Lend-Lease, and that no fresh approach to Congress would be involved. Mr. Jordan had recently proposed a revised programme for import of goods, which he assumed was agreed by the Middle East Supply Centre. He read out the following figures :— Tons. Cereals ... ... ... ... ... 48,000 Dates ... ... ... ... ... 5,000 Tea ... ... ... ... ... ... 400 Sugar ... ... ... ... ... 4,000 Cotton piece-goods .., ... ... ... 1,300 Total value : £2,400,000 at present prices, but might well be about £3 million when supplied. Possibly an arrangement could be made to share this between the two Governments in the manner he had described. Mr. Wallace Murray said that the idea seemed reasonable at first sight. Mr. Pinsent continued that connected with the subsidy problem there was also the currency problem of Saudi Arabia. The assistance given to Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government and the American Government included not only a considerable quantity of gold sovereigns supplied by us (which it was most inconvenient for us to produce), but also an amount of silver which was calculated to be more than equal to all the silver previously in circulation in Saudi Arabia. It was obvious that the silver which was sent was being re-exported to the Persian Gulf or other destinations especially as the official sterling value of the rial coin was substantially less than that of the silver content. What was needed in our view was a currency system which would stop the drain of silver and would have adequate powers of expansion to meet the needs of the pilgrimage. He outlined the scheme which the British Treasury had propounded in Washington for a paper currency linked to sterling, with special arrangements to meet dollar requirements. The currency would be under the control of a currency board. The Treasury had not preconceived ideas about this currency board, except that it had better be outside Saudi Arabia. If London was incon venient, it could be in Cairo. It might be compoaed-of a Saudi Arabian, a British and an American member. Unfrrrtmiately, the United States Treasury had not approyfid-Ahi^Adetr'Trrrrl hajL-put forward a scheme for a currency linked both jjy-sterling and to the dollar and to silver. We were afraid that this would be unworkable in practice and had sent our observations to Washington. Mr. Wallace Murray thanked Mr. Pinsent for his interesting and very lucid explanation. He said that he had not himself followed the currency discussions, though he quite understood their importance. Ibn Saud was always asking the American Government for advances and he realised, of course, that the position was most unsatisfactory. The British comments on the United States proposal had reached Washington since his departure. He seemed to indicate that the proposed link with sterling only was the principal difficulty with the United States Treasury in accepting the British proposals. He wondered if a paper currency would ever find acceptance in such a primitive country. Mr. Pinsent pointed out that paper was acceptable in Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Egypt, and he thought that it should prove acceptable, at any rate in the settled areas such as Jedda. Mecca and Medina, where it was principally needed for financing the pilgrimage. Mr. Pinsent said that we proposed to proceed for the first half of the present vear on the basis of the import programme listed above, but it was then hopedto make a new arrangement and eventually to put our financial assistance on fixed basis. After some further discussion, it was agreed that the details of the arrangement for sharing in the cost of imported goods would be best discussed in ( airo tin ough the Middle l^ast Supply Centre. Mr. Wallace Murray under took to telegraph accordingly. Discussions on currency, however, had better continue in Washington, and Mr. Wallace Murray said that he would empiiasise the need for an early and practical conclusion. Similar telegrams would be sent on the British side. In the course of fhe discussion Mr. Wallace Murray said he heard Ibn Saud was upset at our withholding certain proceeds of the pilgrimage. Mr. Pinsent explained how the pilgrimage had been financed and how' the question had leen satisfactorily settled. Financial Adviser. Sir M. Peterson said that Ibn Saud was seriously worried about the financial situation and had asked us if we could provide a Sunni Moslem financial adviser. A Sunni Moslem was required because the Finance Department was in Mecca. The Government of India had been asked if they could find a suitable Sunni Moslem, but had not yet found one. He would let Mr. Wallace Murrav know the outcome. Mr. Wallace Murray was not previously aware that we had been asked for a financial adviser, but seemed to have no objection to raise. Military Advisers . Sir M. Peterson said that Ibn Saud had also asked us for Sunni Moslems to act as military advisers to train and establish the Saudi Arabian army on modern lines. He understood, however, that an American Military Mission was arnving shortly in Saudi Arabia and he therefore wished to discuss the question - Mr ' Y allace Murra y- Possibly, if the Sunni Moslems were in Mecca and Medina, which were two of the principal garrison towns, their work could be co-ordinated with that of the American officers at Taif. Mr. Wallace Murrav appeared surprised at this information. Mr. holder said that the American officers arriving in Saudi Arabia wen not stnctly speaking, a military mission, but were going to train the Saud Arabian army in the use of the modern weapons which they were shortly receiving Mr. Wallace Murray said that he knew that the War Department attachec much impoitance to this question. He would like fuller information on the whol&lt; subject. It was agreed that a telegram should be sent to Mr. Jordan asking bin to hnd out from Ibn Saud what in his view the function of the Sunni Moslen officers would be, and what would be the relation of their functions to those o the American officers arriving with Colonel Schomber. Provision of Arms. Sir M. Peterson drew attention to the fact that His Majesty’s Government were providing their 50 per cent, of the arms supplied to Ibn Saud as a °-ift while the American Government were providing theirs as Lease-Lend ’The American Government had at one time suggested that all the arms should be provided on the same basis. So far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned they did not feel that there was really any practical advantage in not making a gift ot them, as they were most unlikely ever to get them paid for. It was agreed to let the situation stand as it is.—/*&gt; u/ u v j-L ftToU^cKc^ c/hAAsw*^ ^/jt_ t/&gt;Ue&lt;eC(jts ■ /A ~*'jJ ° t ^ / ^ o^yv^j $ Saudi Arabia: Military Missio ns. Sir Maurice Peterson said that he wished to let Mr. Wallace Murray know that we should be sending a small party to instruct the Saudi Arabian army in the use of the reconnaissance cars which we were sending to them. Mr. Wallace Murray took note of this. Mr. Wallace Murray said that he had been thinking about the question of the Sunni Moslem military mission to train and establish the Saudi Arabian army to which Sir Maurice Peterson had referred in a previous conversation. He gathered that this would be quite separate from the party for training the Saudi Arabians in the use of the reconnaissance cars, which corresponded to Colonel Schomber’s mission. He was greatly afraid that the news of the proposed Sunni Moslem mission might produce from the White House or the War Depart ment more telegrams about “ horning in.” He would like in passing to throw out the following suggestion. The training of the Saudi Arabian army was really of an equal interest both to America and to Great Britain. Neither of us wanted a Saudi Arabian army which was too powerful and both of us wanted one that would be able to maintain internal order. Our aims and interests were the same, and he was wondering if we could not work the matter jointly. He thought that the United States military authorities would certainly want to know that Americans were participating in any such mission. He would be most grateful if Sir Maurice Peterson could give some thought to the possibility of sharing in the military mission in the same way as we were sharing in the provision of arms on a fifty-fifty basis.v • ' JU o/h/' n/a/loLot^ *Cj4&gt;\pO*r\0^ ^ Military M ission to Saud i Arabia. Sir Maurice Peterson, recalling the previous discussions regarding Ibn Saud’s request for a Sunni Moslem military mission and Mr. Wallace Murray’s intimation that the United States War Department would like American partici pation in it, said that, after discussions with the War Office, he wished to make the following suggestion to meet the American point of view : Ibn Sand should he offered a military mission composed partly of Sunni Moslem Indian officers and partly of American officers, but, in view of our special experience in Arab affairs and of our interests in the area, we would like the head of the mission to be a British officer. This would seem especially indicated in view of the number of British officers with special Arab experience. Mr. Wallace Murray said he would discuss this with the United States War Department. Saudi A rabian Finance. Sir Maurice Peterson said he had heard in a telegram from Jedda that Mr. Moose had sent a telegram to King Ihn Saud saying that, if Great Britain were to restrict the financial assistance given to Saudi Arabia, the United States would be able to assist. Ibn Saud had enquired, in reply, whether the offer was made on the instructions of the United States Government or was a personal expression of opinion. Mr. Wallace Murray was obviously surprised at this information and expressed great doubts as to whether it could be correct. He thought that conceivably it might be a garbled and distorted version of the conclusions of the earlier discussions between himself and Sir Maurice Peterson, in which it had been agreed that the British and American Governments would together give financial assistance to Ibn Saud. Sir Maurice Peterson said that he did not wish to emphasise the question at all, but it seemed to him to illustrate the danger of the Americans and British in Saudi Arabia being played off against each other. This seemed to apply whether the actual information was true or false. Mr. Wallace Murray indicated his general agreement with this conclusion. Mr. Kohler said that he wished to explain that, in view of certain doubts expressed by Mr. Pinsent on one or two points of fact, after the second meeting regarding joint Anglo-American action to assist Ibn Saud financially and with supplies, Mr. Wallace Murray had not telegraphed at the time to Mr. Landis as the result of the meeting. Subsequently, Mr. Landis had been approached by the Minister of State’s Office and had telegraphed for direct information as to what had passed. A telegram had therefore been sent to Mr. Landis as agreed, and a telegram had also been sent to Washington emphasising the urgent need for the United States Treasury to reach a conclusion on the currency problem.17619.

Dear Baxter, I have seen Peel's letter to you of the 12th instant al&gt;out Ibn Saud's request for military advisers. I am of course not competent in any way to comment on the political or military aspect of the matter but I do regard it as being of great importance that if a financial adviser is to be provided for Ibn Sand, he should be a British Subject and that this function should not be left to the Americans. It may o± course be that this result will in any case be ensured by Ibn Saud's natural insistence on a Sunni Moslem. But it might be disastrous from our point of view if an Amsrican financial adviser were appointed, and 1 hope that if the matter should come to the point at which on political grounds we have to leave it to the Americans to provide either the military or the financial adviser, the India Office will be prepared to agree that of the two it is more important that we should provide the financial adviser. I have no doubt that you and the India Office will consider whether it is possible to combine in one mission American military officers located at Taif with Indian military officers free to visit the Holy Cities.

Dear Pinsent, You will have had copies of Jordan^ telegrams -JJos. 6, 7 and 8 from Riyadh about Ibn Baud’s request * or military and financial advisers, who should be Sunni Koslems. We are writing separately to the India Office and war Office about the mil1tary advisers, and are inclined to think that it migirt; be better to allow the Americans, who are apparently eager to train the Saudi Arabian army* to undertake this thankless task, we are, however, asking the India Office to ascertain from the Government of India whether there would be any likelihood of their being able to provide Sunni Moslem instructors from the Indian Army, eventuall y be decided, as a result of discussion with the Americans, that we rather than they oujrht to take on the job. As regards Ibn Baud’s request for a financial adviser, we think that it would be very useful if ¥he right person could be found to exercise some control over Saudi Arabian finances. It seems clear, moreover, that, so long as the British subsidy to Ibn Baud remains at anything like its present level, the required financial expert had better be a British subject, we are now considering the question of what is to be said on Saudi Arabian financial questions during the forthcoming conversations with 7/allace Murray, when he comes to London with Stettinius at the end of this month. This question of a British financial adviser will presumably be raised during the discussions, as will also the British subsidy to Ibn Saud, although we must not of course expect Wallace Murray to discuss technical financial questions except in the most general way. G.H.S. Pinsent, Esq Treasury. /If ., C.k.G.,If you agree in principle that, subject to anything that may be decided as a result of discussio with the Americans, it would be well to provide Ibn Saud with a British financial adviser, perhaps Anderson (to whom I am sending a copy of this letter) would be good enough to make preliminary enquiries of the Government of India about the possibility of finding an expert (a Sunni Moslem) with the necessary qualifications. (C.w. Baxter)ith th insent. TREASURY CHAMBERS 14th March, 1944 Dear Dundas Thank’s for your letter of the 13th instant about bn Saud’s request for military and financial advisers. We are much in favour of his being provided with a suitable financial adviser. The finance and currency of the country are in a state of chaos, and it is v-ell possible that the future stability of the Kingdom may depend on some reform. It is^ve^y important from our point of view that the finanoiit/'idviser should be a British subject, no^only because of the subsidy aspect, but also because of the currency aspect. e are, in fact, a good deal in t^e dark at present as regards American intentions on the lend-leasing of further silver, and re have ast* ed our people in Washington if they can throw any light on this. On the other hand, the Americans have put up some proposals for Saudi Arabian currency rhich strike us as pretty crazy, and if they -ere to have their way, Saudi Arabia might well get out of the frying pan into the fire. 'e are in correspondence on this technical currency aspect with our delegation in Washington, and hope to persuade the Americans to accept a reasonable and practical scheme. If, however, an American financial adviser, or one of American sympathies, were sent to Ibn Saud the results might well oe fatal to our attempts to reform the currency, which Vo/ probably vital to any attempt to reform finances. I hope I can assume that we are batting on a relatively easy wicket, because the Americans might have some difficulty in finding a Sunni financial adviser; and I sincerely thnt th* India Office will C.A.F.. Dundas, Esq., Foreign Office. S.W.l. /findfind no difficulty aoout agreeing that the Americans should undertake the training of the baud! Arabian Army. The uost may not be easy to fill. It cannot be very important one, but on the other hand it is extremely tricky. I should add a word about the forthcoming conversa tions with ’'allace Murray. The major question we have under discussion ^ith the Americans at the moment is the currency, and the American proposals have been prepared by the U.S. Treasury, who no doubt regard this subject as their preserve, should accordingly exercise a good deal of caution in any discussion ~ith allace Murray, wbo comes, I assume, from the s tate JS^part'ent. Other wise we might only antagonise the U.S. Treasury and make things more difficult for ourselves. I am sending a copy of this letter to Anderson at the India Office. Yours sincerely.s Mr* ^el . G eneral Molesworth * u^L t C^^cJ~ 'jj 4c t 4CL_ t H- ^ c^'j k u C W^ &amp;P- Please see the Foreign Office's letter of 13 th March below about a request frcm Ibn Saud that H.M.G* should send a senior military expert, accompanied by four or five capable officers*representing the different branches of the Service, to S»udi Arabia to train and establish ^-v* jX small array on sound modem lines. The Foreign Office seem to be inclined to let the Americans undertake the task of providing these military experts, mainly with a view to avoid giving the Americans the idea that we want to keep them out of Saudi Arabia* I should have thought myself, however, that there were strong arguments in favour of our providing the ari i&gt; 1 i . m n r if at all possible. For one thing Ibn Saud has said that he doesn't want Americans and for us now to fail to make any effort to provide them in accordance with his special request is hardly likely to create a favourable impression upon him. This is apart from the fact that if we can produce good men it should have an excellent Effect upon our relations with him for the future. You will see that Ibn Saud says that officers unfit for active service would be perfectly suitable, and perhaps it would not be too difficult to provide such from the Indian Aiw^now? It occurs to me that this would offer a good offifortunity for acapejiioMo^d. officers wishing to enter the Political Service after the War, though of course Indians and not British are what Ibn Saud has particularly asked for. Perhaps Gen. Molesworth would sry whether he thinks such officers are likely to be forthcoming. If so we could then telegraph to the Government of India (presumably the telegram should be addressed to the External Affairs Department.) y /U' RLE COPY ^ ' *7'~ -V S.Xr (B 11+08/325/25) n 19 FOREIGN I 94413th; INDEXED H (rf OFFICE, 3.W.1.

Perhaps you would pass it on to the person in whose competence it falls. We are v/riting separately to the Treasury and India Office about the financial adviser, whom we should rather like to provide if possible. But we are not so sure about the military experts. The Americans have already offered to send instructors for the Saudi army and are proposing to train a few Saudi pilots in the United States, and as they seem somehov/ to have got hold of the idea that we v/ant to keep them out of Saudi Arabia, our preliminary view is that it would be better to let them undertake this th ankle ss task even though they could not presumably find any Sunni Moslems, while we concentrate on the financial side. We shall probably discuss this point with Stettinius and his mission v/hen they come here at the end of the month, and it would be very helpful if you could in the meantime ascertain from the Government of India v/hether there would be any likelihood of their being able to provide Sunni Moslem instructors from the Indian Army, should it eventually be decided that we rather than the Americans ought to take on the job. am sending a copy of this letter to Jones, M.I.2a.

Lord Moyne told the King that Major Smith of the Midale East Supply Council had come with him to Jedda ana would perhaps be able to answer quest!one on supply that Hie Majesty might wish to raise* The King pointed to nullah A1 Suleiman and said ’’Let the experts get together. w He explained that the Minister of finance would meet Major Smith and talk over details of the questions, meanwhile he could give Lord Moyne a general picture: For a number of reasons, chief of which was the war and the export restrictions enforced by ail the neighbouring countries, and then the severe drought of the last three or four years, the people of Nejd were nearer to famine than they had ever been before. The import traffic which had in peace time gone on steadily and continuously from Iraq, Transjordan, Kov.eit, Bahrein, Sudan and Egypt, and which had sufficed to keep the country supplied, had dried up completely. He could look to no salvation except the continuance of such channels as the British Government could make available to him. Prices had risen enormously# Added to the lack of food was the lack of clothing: the little cloth that was coming in had gone up in price until it was beyond the means of any but the wealthy. The poor who used to clothe themselves for two or three riyals now went literally naked. Bound up with the food problem was that of transport: the people of Nejd and outlying parts of the HejazH: If! ? i ^ .-43^ (&gt;; ;; were being saved iron starvation only by -4 •. . .

The distances to be covered were very great, there was no pasture in many regions and therefore camels were unable to make the trips; everything depended on lorries. i.ven if sufficient food could be shipped to Jedda to~ supply the country’s heeds it *°uld not prevent starvation unless it could be carried to all parts of the interior. The King had explained many times how his rule and the maintenance oi publip. security throughout the land depended on the will oi God and after that the motor car: In the present crisis the very life of the people depended on having lorries. Lord Moyne informed His Majesty of the impending despatch within a short time of a fully equipped - mobile workshop with three British mechanics. His Majesty expressed his gratitude and repeated that he was most deeply grateful to His Majesty s Government for all their help now and in the past. ^ For the future, he had full confidence in His Majesty s Government’s friendship and understanding. He had given Lord Moyne a true picture of the state of the country and, as his habit had always been, left it to His Majesty’s Government to do On the basis oi that knowledge whatever they thought wds best for the common cause. o , J a cl .Moqsa 3‘id’ imns xw qu unaod aIqc oaH M lu ejL SECRET XXX © Allotted to Politico!

Government of India No.50 . IMMEDIATE. coco Your telegram No.44 o f February 5th. I informed the Minister of Finance accordingly. Whilst expressing deep gratitude for His Maiesty s Government s help he wished'to insist on two points: (a) If he could be given no idea of the total help to be afforded during the year he could not plan ahead. I admitted this but pointed out that the figures he had given me, and in which I had based my appeal to you, represented, according to his own statement, the irreducible minimum expenditure. The best he could do was to carry on on that basis. He agreed but feared that charges for assistance of the unemployed might be higher. I said that this would to a great extent be offset by enforced economy in the purchase of supplies of imported motorcars, which were not available. (b) Even if His Majesty's Government doubled the amount of sterling advance in March it would notsplve the immediate problem which, as I knew, was the prpvision of riyals. Ine Saudi Arabian Government had no riyals and no sovereigns with v/hich to buy them and could consequently not pay salaries. To meet their needs they must have 200,000 sovereigns within the next two weeks. I said r , a 1 I had laid the whole situation as clearly as I could before you (my telegram No.49 of Febr uary 1st, ord paragraph) 'u&amp;b and His Majesty's Government were doubtless studying the ^ ^ problem. In view of the urgency I would enquire urgently whether a proportion of sovereigns required could be shipped or flown from India to avoid a crisis and was asking the Minister of State if he could spare a financial expert to visit Jedda and make recoveries. 2. I am satisfied after a long talk with the manager of the Netherlands Trading Society and pther non-Saudis involved in the question that the position is critical and that the only immediate cure lies in the supply of at least 100,000 sovereigns at once* i r scd. pol. r r ;p T . i ^ i h jij I 11 ^’CEE 725/7/25 /CYPHER/ OUTWARD TELEGRAM SECRET.

Foodstuffs, list of which was contained in my telegram No.2, are those for whose purchase Ibn Saud asked that credit might be opened (see my telegram No.364 to the Foreign Office repeated to you as No.139). He further asked that Basra foodstuffs might if possible be supplied direct to him by the Government of India, in order to save middle men’s profits. He has consequently not appointed an agent to handle the purchase. 3. Supplies are for Nejd and for distribution among the tribes and for the King’s household and entourage. They form only a part of the total food requirements of the country and full estimate of which was enclosed with my letter to you of June 19th 1941. 4. Ibn Saud has sent me several reminders stating that his need is becoming very pressing and begging that the matter may be expedited. It would be helpful, if the quantities which he asked to be supplied at once (see my telegram No.2. second paragraph), could be despatched by the earliest ship in advance, if possible of the financial arrangement. 5. As regards wheat the pre-war sources of supply, other than India, were France and Australia.

Royalties and rental over the past three years have averaged less than a million dollars a year and it is only because the Company here fully realise their strong interest m the stability of the regime that they have felt justified in making advances amounting to about &lt; three^times the amounts actually due to the Government of Saudi-Arabia; as a purely commercial proposition SUCh a pel 1 r-v__wmi 1 X__np i^nnp^j ftaCo.

In my opinion Saudi-Arabian Government have done their best to reduce expenditure and I do not think it is possible for them in existing circumstances to raise local ^ cann ot be denied that there is waste through mitering and neglect of gpvernment equipment and supplies, but to remedy this a drastic re-organization of administration would be required and greatly increased salaries would have to be paid and paid punctually. Such a re-organization, entailing as it would the replacement of many incompetent Saudi officials 0 by eperienced and efficient men from neighbouring Moslem countries would, supposing it were practicable in war-time, be of undoubtedly lasting benefit but would in the meantime, I fear, result in greater expenditure and in calling for increased help from His Majesty s Government., Present administration is at least cheap. There must be few countries where the annual government expenditure works out at not more than fourteen shillings per head of population. [INDIV].

Before deciding on amount of financial assistance that can ^e given to Ibn Saud during 1942, we would like further infor- Nation on following points. Ax-xii. 2. Total estimated revenue apart from oil royalties is aid to amount to only £250,000 instead of the pre-war figure m^f about £2,000,000. So complete a collapse is difficult toP^o Dedr ^understand. No doubt the reductions in the pilgrimage, the ■ tI /y j s ^ customs revenues and the agricultural tax have resulted in serious fall of revenue, but we should like a fairly close \icc:la\ analysis of the foregoing figures. It is moreover difficult to believe that there is no means whatever of increasing ' revenue, and we shall be glad to receive details of further / measures which Saudi Arabian authorities have had under con- v ftoto sideration to this end. 5. Detailed information is also desired regarding the ^ measures taken by Saudi Arabian authorities to cut down expen diture. Ibn Saud’s abandonment of his pilgrimage is a good beginning^ but it is clear that a serious effort is required to economise in all directions. 4. '.That annual royalties are paid by California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and to what extent have loans been advanced to the Saudi-Arabian Government on the security of these royalties? Cannot the Company, who have a strong interest in the stability of Ibn Saud’s regime, be expected to do more? 5. When telegraphing any further information supplied by Saudi Arabian authorities, please state whether you are your self satisfied that they have really attempted to deal adequately... with the country ’ s-financial err sis, bath by cutting down expenditure and by devising other means of increasing revenue. 6 0 In your conversations with these authorities you should endeavour to bring home to them that your willingness to recommend assistance is conditional on your being satisfied that the prospective deficit on their Budget for 1942 could n?t be^reduced by greater efforts on their part, and that, in view of the heavy demands on our Exchequer imposed by the war, His Majesty s Government would clearly require adequate proof assistance on an appropriate scale was indispen- sabr^ before they could consider request for it.

On receiving report of my conversation Yusuf Yasin ordered the Minister of Finance to give me a full and frank statement of the financial position instructing him at the same time not to ask for any given sum hut to leave it to me to decide in the light of figures &gt; submitted v/hat help could reasonably be asked of His Majesty s Government. 2. Figures reveal most dangerous state of affairs. For three' years before the war average annual expenditure was approximately £5,000,000.' of which rather less than £2 ? 000,000 was met by customs and pilgrim dues and internal taxation, and the remaining £1,000,000 represented payments by oil and T CD- 1 concessionary companies. In 1941 expenditure has increased by about £750,000 and revenue has fallen by nearly ^1,800,000. His Majesty's Government made loans amounting to gave 10,000,000 riyals, worth roughly £ 800 . 000 &gt; or ^1,400 ? 000 tsic]. There will thus be debt or £1,150,000 in 1941 owing^ for supplies obtained on credit and to the Government officials for arrears of salary. 3. Increase in expenditure is attributable almost entirely to increased distribution of money and food, not only to Nejd tribesmen who suffered from a drought, t but to Heiazi townsmen who have been reduced to poverty owing to falling off of the pilgrimage. 4. Decrease of revenue is due to the following causes (a) Greatly decreased number of pilgrims. (b) Reduced customs revenues. Not only have imports ^ decreased owing to lack of pilgrims, especially of the richer type from Java and Malay, but duties have had to be reduced by 25$ to enable impoverished population to buy imported goods. (c) Drought resulted in death and slaughter owing to lack of pasture of a large proportion of animals and tne agricultural tax, where not abolished, produced little. 5. The Minister of Finance does not foresee any improvement in the situation in 1942 and the position will thus be as follows:- Estimated expenditure based on 1941 figures, £3,700,000.

Dear cyers. ISth June. 1941 m klyala fo r ibn i.aud , On June 5th I sent Hardie a copy of a telegram Toy; (j o.o 583) from the Government of India on this subject, which described the progress of minting and despatch, and went on to say that they assumed that definite arrangements as regards payment would be settled by us. t You have no doubt seen the Jedde 'most immediate' telegram of May 20th (No. 169) and the Foreign Office reply 4 ° 22nd (No.104). (For some reason we have only Just had a copy of these, after an interval of weeks). It highly problematical whether the Saudi Government will ever pay for the coins. It has been understood from the outset that His Majesty s Government made themselves responsible for the payment, end in the faith of this the Government of India, impressed by the urgency of the appeal conveyed to them, have pressed on with the minting and despatch without (as they would otherwise naturally have doney covering themselves by payment or due security in advance. I have no doubt you will agree that it would not be reasonable to ask the Government of India to give indefinite credit to Ibn Saud^ Government, even with a British Government guarantee of eventual paymentj since the natural tendency would be not to implement this guarantee until every faintest hope of the Saudis paying had evaporated. C. G. L. Syers, Esq., Treasury, 8.W.I. an/2 . en undertaking that, should the 3audi Government not pay up within that time. His Majesty^ Government will themselves foot the bill. I should think, however, that from your standpoint, - with en eye to possible future reclamation of the debt, or to some political consideration for the waiving of it, - such on arrangement would be less advantageous than for His Majesty’s Government to pay Ind now, and for His Majesty’s Government to step into the position of the suppliers to whom the payment from the * Saudis is due. This last proposition is therefore what I suggest you should accept. If you do, we will ascertain from India the co-rect amount (including freight), and claim in the usue3 way.OUTWARD TELEGRAM 4 ^ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s government,'and shou d be kept under Lock and Key.] -m.: :ai.v'i5V:'D} ^ [Cypher] Attain DEF .

Mr. Twitchell explained that Ibn Sand had asked him to interest United States companies in developing water and agriculture in Saudi Arabia. Twitchell had found that'there were no commercial possibilities m this, but had contacted State Department. He and they agreed that there was scope for a small mission of experts to explore irrigation and agricultural position in Saudi Arabia and to present reports; but in present circumstances the principal purpose of such a mission would be political, i.e. to work upon the King and population in somewhat the same ways as American observers are designed to operate in North Africa. State Department were disposed to offer Ibn Saud such a mission, but appreciate they stood a much better chance of obtaining sanction for it and perhaps credits also for Ibn Saud if they were able to tell other United States Departments concerned that His Majesty’s Government were not only at present disposed to assist the mission [?Grp. omitted ?but] atta hed such importance to maintaining stability of Ibn Saud’s regime that they were pre pared to increase their present subsidy to him. 2, It was explained to Mr. Twitchell that His Majesty’s Government had no doubt decided extent to which they should help Ibn Saud in the light of political situation as reported to them, and that there were many other large demands upon their financial resources. Moreover we here had no reason to think that Ibn Saud was either wobbling in his own views or feeling insecure. Mr. Twitchell replied that it was not a question of a bribe but of ensuring that Ibn Saud had sufficient revenue to police his country and keep the tribal leaders loyal and contented; he said also that there was strong German propaganda in Arabia, not Italian or Russian* and also a good deal of anti-British feeling* 3. I am naturally not fully infoimed here as to the situation in Saudi Arabia, but it seems to me that financially it would be prudent to ensure a. c onsidurable margin of safety there. Irom^the local point of view I hope that His Majesty’s Government will give full and sympathetic consideration to American initiative for co-operation in the common cause of hold ing positron in the Middle East, presented with somewhat characteristic casualncss in this telegram and my previous telegrams Nos. 2050 and 22U.

Dear Syers, We are most grateful for the Treasury’s prompt agreement to Stonehewer-Bird*s recommendation that we should immediately advance to Ibn Saud a further sum of £200,000, 2. There remains for consideration the suggestion that payment for the riyals now being minted in India should be deferred until they can conveniently be paid for. It seems to us that the time is far distant when Ibn Saud will be in a position to pay for the riyals, the cost of which, according to the Government of India’s estimate, will amount to something between 1,700,000 and 1,900,000 United States dollars. We feel therefore that we shall have to face the fact that in the end the cost of these riyals may fall upon His Majesty's Government. We have always held the view that we should have to give Ibn Saud increased monetary assistance, and Bird's telegram has convinced us that we must make this assistance substantial. Ibn Saud is about our only staunch friend in the Arab world, and with the present critical situation in Iraq we cannot afford to let him lose his grip on his own country for lack of an adequate subsidy. Information from other sour jes that German agents are being instructed to devote special attention to Saudi Arabia lend force to lird's fear that unless Ibn Saud can pay his tribesmen and officials, German bribes may well seduce them from their allegiance. 3. We hope therefore that the Government of India will agree to a How Ibn Saud time to pay for the riyals, and that His Majesty’s Government on their part will be prepared to guarantee the nayment, if, as we fear, Ibn Saud never finds himself in a position to meet the debt. 4.

In his despatch Mo .8. of the 6 th February last, which a copy was sent to you under Foreign Office letter E 945/252/25, of the 28th March, Mr. Stonehewer- Bird reported that Ibn Saud was bitterly disauoointed with His 1 . 133 esty s Government’s original offer of £100,000, which was made to him in response to his request for a credit of £250,000 gold for the purchase of foodstuffs in •2 x ? 3 ^ au( ^ pointed out the danger of his oosition if the war should spread and the need for him to be strong and well-prepared. His Majesty required funds on which he could draw if the need arose and suggested that a sum of at least £800,000 was necessary for 'this purpose. His majesty s Government eventually increased the offer to £200,000 and Mr. Stonehewer-Bird was instructed to say. m conveying this decision to Ibn Saud, that, while His Majesty s Government could make no promise regarding possible future credits, they v/ould always be ready to listen sympathetically to requests from him based on his ?X ilho financial needs (see Foreign Office letter E 1039/252/25. ^ of the 8 th March). / ' ’ 3. The accompanying note shows that Ibn Saud’s need for assistance to offset the loss of revenue occasioned by the war is genuineo Their Lordships will be aware of the importance attached by His Majesty’s Government not only to retaining Ibn Saud’s goodwill, but also to assisting him to maintain his position in his own country. They will also recollect that in War Cabinet Conclusions 167 (40), of 15th June, general approval was given to the suggestions made by the Chiefs of Staff Committee in paragraph 3 of their memorandum W.P. (40) 205 of 14th June, the third of which reads as follows: 'Ibn/ The Secretary td the Treasury. •fW ^ppp —— j WOLOWJRe IN WEEKLY | No. 3 j ‘I AUG 1940 | I FROM SECSETAHy, POLITICAL AND | ' l SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICEH H If II I'^n oauc should be encouraged in every way Cmc-Ludmg material ,? encouragement; to greater extent than heretofore t9 demonstrate his friendship to this country' 1 * 4* Hostilities have now spread to the Middle East and it is therefore essential that His Majesty*s Government should leave nothing undone which can be done to strengthen their influence and that of friendly states wherever it is likely to be effective. As Mr. Stonehewer-Bird indicates in his telegram No.170, Ibn Baud is exercising a moderating and steadying influence which is most valuable and he deserves all the encouragement that can be given to him. If, instead of waiting until the inevitable request for further financial assistance is received. His Majesty's Government now offer to Ibn Baud further reasonable sums, this will not only show him that his attitude is appreciated and encourage him to maintain it, but it will also bring satisfaction to his tribesmeno 5. For the reasons given above Lord Halifax endorses Mr. Btonehewer Bird's reconraendation that a further sum of £600,000 should now be offered to Ibn Baud, payable in instalments of £200,000 every two months on the same conditions as the advance of £200,000 which was offered in April lasto I am therefore to express the hope that Their Lordships will concur in this recommendation and will sanction the offer on the terms suggested* Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Colonial Office and India Office, and to the Chairman and Secretary of the Middle East Officia], Committee of the War Cabinet. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,U 2260/2060/25; Note on Jedda Telegram No. 170 of 1st August, 1940. Mr. Bird suggests that a . arther M loan' of &lt;;600 &gt; 0o0 sterling to Ibn daud be given on the same conditions as the previous B200,000 sterling. In our telegram No. 58 of the PZ.Znof 6th April, in which His Majesty’s uovermnent’s decision to / g give financial assistance to Ibn daud was conveyed to Mr. Bird, it was stated that as there was little prospect of a credit of ^200,000 ever being repaid it would be better to treat it frankly as a subsidy. Mr. Bird was therefore instructed to inform the daudi Arabian Government that r ’His Majesty’s Government have now decided as a matter 'of friendly regard to make advances up to a total of '£200,000 without any signed agreement providing for the 'annual payment of charges, or laying down the terms of 'repayment. His Majesty’s Government are content to 'rely on Ibn Gaud to repay the advances as soon as his 'convenience permits.' 2. In the absence of any Budget or statistics it is difficult to give any estimate of the Saudi revenues. In 1938 Sir header Bullard estimated that the total revenue amounted to £1,300,000 gold (say *,2,600,000 sterling at today’s prices) of which £600,000 gold (say £1,200,000 sterling) is derived from Customs receipts and about £600,000 gold (£1,200,000 sterling) of the remainder comes from the pilgrimage This estimate leaves out of account the oil royalties. In 1939 the output of the oilfield at Dhahran was 10,000 barrels a day, the royalties on which would amount to about £100,000 gold (£200,000 sterling) per annum. It may be supposed that the war will prevent any increase of production, if it does not actually lead to a curtailment of the present output. Another possible source of income, the gold mine at Mahd, has also suffered from the war owing to the difficulty of obtaining cyanide. Customs receipts may also be presumed to be seriously affected by the interruption of communications in the Ked Gea. 3. As regards the pilgrimage it can be said roughly that the daudi Government takes about £10 gold (£20 sterling) as dues from each pilgrim. The revenue from this source must then have fallen from £600,000 gold (£l,200,GCC sterling) in 1938-1939, when there were about 60,000 pilgrims, to £250,000 gold (£500,000 sterling) in 1939-1940, when the estimated number of oversea pilgrims was 25,000. It is unlikely that there will be any larger number of pilgrims this year in spite of what His Majesty’s Government are trying to do to ensure that the number shall at least be no fewer, and Ibn Gaud cannot count on any more, if indeed he can count on as much, revenue from this source. 4. Besides the sums taken by the Government, each pilgrim spends a certain amount of money in the country. Mr. Bird gives the average annuel value of the pilgrimage, based presumably on a normal year of about 60,00C pilgrims, as £2,250,000 sterling. Of this sum about £1,200,000 sterling represents Saudi /Government&gt;. r a 4 ; % 4oUo ; !940 j joverniKent dues It w«a cstimoted In 1937 that a pilgrim of the poorest class spends about sterling all tola on the pilgrimage* Cn this basis, Mr* Bird's figures would seem to be rather high, since §0,000 pilgrims spending a ,30 sterling each would yield a total of *l,BQO # cOQ sterling, though some allowance must be ra&amp;ue for the greater expenditure of the richer class of pilgrim* Assuming, however, that of the poorer pilgrims £30 sterling, £10 la tauten in auea and £l) la spent in the country, the reduction in numbers from 60, COO pilgrims to 8f&gt;,00C represents s loss to the country* apart from the loss of revenue, of £3i&gt;0,0c0 gold (£7jG,UO aterlingj, &amp;• On a rough computation, the alfierence between the 1938/39 and 1939/40 pilgrimages may be put as follows in £ sterling t- ieudi ^0 Vermont uues expenditure In the country 1,800,000 6 CX),OOQ Cl ,600,000 Ret lou. to the country &gt; Cl,0ti0,000 600,000 2bO*OOQ 760,000 6 * fhe difference for the ^udi budget, as suming no change ^ A ime fcnd oil royeities, works out aa fcht&amp;t.'Wihi'iiv.ssjiiw Pilgrimage dues Oustoms Oil royalties 1,800,000 1,800,000 — 2-00 x022 jda oQ tiao SCO ,0)0 1,800,000 800.000 1,900 ,&lt;000 III* fall in revenue amounts to 1700,000 or • little over 2 t&gt; of the original ilguree.

INDIA OFFICE You will remember that when Ibn Baud has sought advice from His Majesty's Government in past about possible Italian aggression their replies have been coloured by belief that Italy would have nothing to gain from military point of view by landings on the Saudi Arabian coast in event of Anglo-Italian hostilities. See in this /connexion my t elegram No. 69 r of the 27th April, 1959 and my telegrams [ifbj ^ os * j and 11 of the SOthTjanuary ? 1940. ' 2. Recent events in Europe suggest, however, that Italian Government might think it worth while landing native agents and small bodies of mobile troops, even if they had to abandon them subsequently, with object of causing as much alarm and destruction and disaffection as they could manage before being dealt with. Conditions in Arabia are obviously quite different from those in Northern Europe and it is not suggested that Italian technique would necessarily follow the German a But underlying principles might be the same. 5. I must leave it to you to judge whether warning to this effect could be kept secret and whether Saudi Arabian Government could take effective steps to counter any such attempts if the danger were brought to their notice. You may think only effect of y/arning would be to make them frightened and ready to believe in advance that Italians can raid Saudi Arabia with impunity. But if you think it would do any good you should mention the danger discreetly, drawing attention to what has happened elsewhere, and suggest that such advance measures as are possible should be taken to counter it. 4. Since the Saudi Arabian Government will no doubt enquire what His Majesty’s Government could do in that case to protect and assist them, it may help you to know that possibility of such ( landings has been foreseen in dispositions made for His Majesty's ships in Red Sea. Admiralty cannot guarantee that small parties here and there might not slip through the net, but they are satisfied that they will from the outset have such control of the Red Sea as would render difficult further maintenance of such parties. Moreover, His Majesty's Government would probably^find it necessary to mop up any party which succeeded in establishing itself at some point on the Saudi Arabian coast, in order that the free passage of the Red Sea should not be threantened or interrupted. You should, therefore, be careful to avoid giving the impression *ECd. POL. DEF*r. 1 5 hJN 940 INDIA OFFICE2. impassion that His Majesty’s Ships in the Red Sea could afiord absolute protection for Saudi Arabia from such raids. But, subject to this, you may repeat the assurances already given in the communications referred to in paragraph 1 and add that His Majesty’s Government have made their dispositions in the Red Sea with the Italian threat in mind.

INDIA OFFICE In your letter of January 20th 1 (E'T , 8T3/'fQD r i 1l /0ft ) juu suggested that it might he a good thing for me to have a talk with Ballereau about Arab federation and cognate subjects. I followed your suggestion and read him parts of the paper which you said had been communicated confidentially to the French Government. Ballereau was gratified especially so as he feels very strongly that there is not sufficient contact between His Majesty's Government and the French Government in the matter of policy in Arabia. He felt that we should know exactly what the French views and policy were and that His Majesty's Government on their side should keep the French fully informed. I said I thought that there was such contact, but he considered that it was not sufficiently close nor was it sufficiently generally knov/n that such contact existed. There were Syrians ready to whisper to French officials that France must mind her step as the British were plotting to form an Arab federation under their protection. As regards this question of federation Ballereau felt as I do that Ibn Saud cannot want it. He as head of the least advanced of the four states could only play a minor rdle and might indeed feel that his country if not during his own reign then after his death would be engulfed by its more advanced and more powerful neighbour Iraq to which Trans-Jordan would probably have joined itself. Ibn Saud was much too intelligent to think that he could possibly dominate or be anything but a junior partner in a federation and he would not accept this humble r6le. What I think Ibn Saud meant was not Arab federation but the formation of an Arab bloc guaranteed by His Majesty's Government not only against aggression from outside but guaranteed against the aggression of one against the other. In other v/ords Ibn Saud wanted to feel safe not only in the event of attack by a European power but against the possibility of Iraq taking advantage of the situation to attack him. As regards Syria Ballereau did not think that the idea of federation would appeal unless France was there to see that Syria was not swallowed by a combination of Iraq and Trans-Jordan. The Syrians wanted complete liberty but liberty under the aegis of France. France was to supply all the money, all the moral and if need be, the armed support required for the maintenance of independence but she must derive no economic or other benefits from the arrangement and the fact of her backing must not be apparentJ Ballereau then spoke of the Mufti at whose birth he had, he said, been present when he was Consul at Damascus.

Besides being a mistake it was so un-English* The French were vindictive and would have acted as we did ; hut cur strength lay in our ability to forget the past. It was not in French nature or policy to treat ex Irish rebels, Mr. Gandhi and others as we treated them. People like Nehru would if under French protection be banished to a desert island whereas he Ballereau had been present at Singapore when Nehru in a hall put at his disposal by the local Government had ended his speech with the words: H V/e hope that we shall soon be strong enough to expel the English from India”, whereupon the police band lent for the occasion had struck up ”God save the King” and the company had dispersed happily - very English and utterly un-French,, Another point which Ballereau made was that our attitude to Ibn Saud v/as much more reasonable than that of France and especially Syria which could not appreciate as we did the difficult course which Ibn Saud had to steer,, Y/e understood that if Ibn Saud gave hospitality to and appeared to sympathize with persons known to be opposed to our policy it was because he was obliged in his capacity of Arab ruler in charge of the Holy Land to express interest and even sympathy with Moslem aspirations towards freedom from European control. Ibn Saud however fully realized where his political interests lay and he would never take any step which would result in estranging the sympathy of the British. The French couldn’t see the matter in this light. If they received news that Ibn Saud had been showing kindness and listening to a Syrian malcontent they immediately started to doubt Ibn Saud’s friendship for the Allies. He Ballereau had great difficulty in persuading Puaux who was inexperienced in matters oriental and consequently depended much toe much on his advisers that Ibn Saud is, in his own interest if for no other reason, on the side of the Allies, He insisted once again on the importance which he attached to the two Governments taking each other completely into each other’s confidence over their aims in Arabia. Whilst there was complete unity fef aim in the prosecution of the war the opportunity should be taken to discuss and agree upon the line we each proposed to take both during and after the war. Yours ever, (Sd.) Hugh S. Bird.u TT [E 1759/953/6S] Copy No. Mr. Baggallay to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird (Jedda).( y ) My dear Bird, Foreign Office, May 10, 1940. WE have read with the greatest interest your letter of the 8th April about our policy in the Arab countries. 2. As regards the particular question of Anglo-French co-operation in the Middle East, you are perfectly right in thinking that contact exists between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government. It is close and constant. I do not mean that Great Britain and France have an agreed plan for the future of the Middle East—which means primarily an agreed plan for the future of Palestine, Transjordan and Syria. Nobody can tell to-day whether our idea of giving Palestine her independence by “ white paper ' stages or the French idea of a treaty with Syria on the Iraqi or Egyptian model when the times are more propitious will suffice in a post-war world, conditions of which are necessarily unknown to-day. The path ahead is too dark at present for making plans except on the most abstract plane, and I do not think it is practicable for anyone m either country, by taking thought, to define his aims or agree upon a line of policy except in so far as the aims and the lines of policy of both countries are inherent in the nature of things (e.g., their general strategical needs) or their public declarations (e.g., the white paper) (and, incidentally, I should personally like both the French and ourselves to come through the war, if we possibly can, without making any more promises to anybody about the future of the “ Arab countries ”). 3. Nor does the existence of co-operation mean that the two Governments see eye to eye in every particular. That would be manifestly impossible. We may have occasional qualms as to whether the French are not being too strict in Syria. The French may have qualms as to whether we are not too lax in Iraq. But there is also a recognition of the fact that in the long run French methods pay when worked by the French, and British methods when worked by the British, and that in any case it is necessary to back the other up in whatever he decides, after full reflexion, to he the best methods for territory where he is mainly concerned. 4. But none of this means that His Majesty’s Government and the French Government are not in agreement. It is true to say that they are in agreement to agree. Every responsible Minister and official in both countries recognises that they must sink or swim together ; that it is as necessary to work in unison in the Middle East as in every other part of the world; and that, if ever the time were to come for remodelling the Middle East, they must remodel it together. Yours ever, LACY BAGGALLAY. (i) A copy of this letter has been given to the French Embassy. [5—54] ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER No. 2 1 3 Of,iAY 1940 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND 8E0RET DEPT.

It has been decided th^t as the prospect of a credit of £200,000 ever being repaid is remote, it will be better to treat it frankly as a subsidy, so far at any rate as administrative procedure in this country is concerned. Sum required will therefore be paid out of Vote of Credit; no agreement with Export Credits Guarantee Department such as was contemplated for original offer of £85,000 for arms will be required; and no interest will be charged. 2. You may therefore inform the Saudi Arabian Govern ment that His Majesty's Government have now decided, as a matter of friendly regard, to make advances up to a total of £200,000 'without any signed agreement providing for the payment of charges or laying down the terms oof repayment. His Majesty's Government are content to rely on Ibn Saud to repay the advances as soon as his convenience permits. 3. You should explain that the money is intended for purchases within the sterling area and cannot be used for obtaining foreign exchange. Approximately £40,000 will be needed for payments to the Mint etc. for 1,000,000 riyals, and the balance of approximately £160,000 will be placed at disposal of the Saudi Arabian Government in blocked accounts in countries within sterling area in which purchases will be made /2. made. 4.

CONFIDENTIAL. | March i i Q .J Section 1. 1 4 (' [E 945/252/25J Copy No. * ^ Mr. Stonehewer-Bird to Viscount Halifaa:.—(Received March 1.) (No. 8.) My Lord, Jedda, February 6, 1940. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 21, 22 and 23 of the 5th February, I have the honour to report that, on receipt of your Lordship's instructions, I addressed to Ibn Saud two communications, of which copies are enclosed. 2. As immediately after the translation of these letters had been completed the King called for me, I handed them to him in person, explaining that I did not expect any reply until the following day, when he was also receiving me. 3. Ibn Saud, however, preferred to read the letters at once. He read the letter about Dr. Grobba first, and expressed gratification at its terms. He made no immediate reference to the question of guarantee. 4. The letter about arms and a credit was, I fear a bitter disappointment to him. He said, immediately after reading it: “I cannot accept £100,000. My people and my enemies outside my borders will say that that is all I am worth in the eyes of my friends the British.” Still, let His Majesty’s Government rest assured that, even if he did not accept this sum or get the sum he wanted his friendship was unalterable and, however much they might try, no foreign Power could shake his friendship. I thanked him for this further mark of friendship and said that our friendship for him was also so great that, had he felt obliged to have a German Minister here, much as they would have deplored the necessity, His Majesty’s Government would not have allowed their relations to have been affected by his action. Ibn Saud then touched on the question of the danger of his position if the war spread and the need for him to be strong and well prepared. £100,000 would be of no good to him. The point was not so much that he had immediate needs as that he must know and be able to tell his people that there existed funds on which he could draw if the need arose. He then got down to details, and said that what he would like was for a sum of at least £800,000 to be earmarked for his use during the war if and when he needed it. I replied that His Majesty had seen from my note that I had been authorised not only to offer a credit up to £100.000, but to state that His Majesty’s Government would also consider sympathetically suggestions for the further strengthening of the economic position of Saudi Arabia. His present request differed from his original request, and I could only submit it to His Majesty’s Government. As I was to have the honour of a further interview on the morrow, we could talk again on this matter. As regards the danger of his position, I said that his best assurance lay in the fact that his interests and ours were identical: we had the same interest in seeing a strong, united and independent Saudi Arabia as he had. 5. He then touched briefly on his relations with Iraq and Koweit, and suggested that his Ministers, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafez Wahba, might, if I agreed, conveniently call on me and try to reach an understanding on the outstanding questions. I agreed and, as the time for prayer was approaching, withdrew. 6. Before leaving the palace I asked Sheikh Hafez Wahba to call on me in the afternoon and discuss the matter of credit, on which bv then the King might have expressed further views in private. I wished to discuss before my next interview whether Ibn Saud had any intention of suggesting security for the much larger loan for which he was now asking. 7. Hafez Wahba duly called, and I asked him whether, in his opinion, the King would persist in his rejection of the offer of £100.000 credit for purchase of food-stuffs in India, Hafez Wahba said yes. Ibn Sand was very sad. The sum he had received would be compared with the very large sum loaned to Turkey, and he would lose face in the eyes of his own people and his enemies alike. I explained that no possible comparison could be drawn between the two transactions. The [3—86]2 loan to Turkey was a business transaction entered into because the exigencies o the moment and considerations of self-defence demanded it. I he loan to Ibn Baud was the loan of one friend to another who was temporarily short ot cash. No guarantee had been asked, and questions of repayment, &amp;c., were treated as ot secondary importance, to be settled later. I thought that the King ought to teel very pleased that within ten days of his asking for temporary assistance £100,000 was offered. Sheikh Hafez knew that finances were not conducted m the United Kingdom as they were here. The Secretary of State could not, as could the King when he wanted to offer a present or a loan, dip his hand into a box and produce the sovereigns. Revenue in England was contributed by the tax-payer, who had an uncomfortable habit of wanting to know how his contribution was spent. I hoped that Sheikh Hafez would be able to make the King realise that the production, almost at a moment’s notice, of so large a sum was in itself a remarkable proof of H4s Majesty’s Government’s readiness to help. He and the King could interpret my note. It seemed to me that it meant that £100,000 was the immediate response, and that more might be hoped for later if there was any real need for it. I hoped the King would not refuse it. Sheikh Hafez said that the King could see the scoffing references in the Arab press : “ Ibn Saud bought by the British for £100,000.' I replied that it was ridiculous, anyhow, to talk about “buying,” as Ibn Saud was known to be on our side. \es, said Hafez Wahba, but the Germans were prepared to pay £400,000 to have him on their side, or so Khalid-al-Hud had told him. What the King wanted was a credit for £800.000 to be open for the duration of the war and to be used as and when required, repayment to be made after the war. It was not so much that he had immediate need of this sum, but he wanted to be able to tell his people that his friendship with Great Britain had resulted in his having something to fall back upon in time of need. Pilgrimage receipts this year were bad; next year they would be worse, and he did not want to have to be perpetually coming to us, £ ‘ like a Bedowi with his hand out,” asking for small sums. 8. I told Hafez that I feared that, if we got up high among the hundred thousands, the transaction might cease to be a transaction among friends, but would become a business transaction. Awkward questions of security for the loan, interest, repayment. &amp;c., would have to be settled in advance. What would be the King’s reaction if asked for security ? Turkey, whom they were so fond of citing, had exports, raisins, tobacco. &amp;c. I raised this point, as Mr. de Gaury had told me that he thought the King expected a bargain. 9. I asked Hafez Wahba whether he thought the King could be induced to accept the £100,000 if it were placed to his credit freely to use as he liked. I felt that I was justified in the light of paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 10 in making this suggestion. An alternative suggestion made by Hafez Wahba was that not only the £100.000 food credit but the £85.000 arms credit which, on my own showing, could not, at any rate for the moment, be used for the purchase of arms in Great Britain, should be freed, and that to the resulting free credit of £185,000 £15,000 should be added, making £200,000 in all. It would be understood that the assistance so afforded was for this year’s needs, and that it would be open for him to submit for the sympathetic consideration of His Majesty’s Government an application for help, if needed, next year. I asked why there should be magic in £200,000 if £100,000 was so derisory a figure in the eyes of the outside world. Hafez Wahba explained that the magic would lie in Ibn Saud’s ability to say to his people that he had been given all the help he needed this year, and felt confident that His Majesty’s Government would help him, if necessary, next year. 10. Hafez Wahba said that the real reason for the King’s statement to Sir R. Bullard that he wished to await the end of the war before purchasing arms was that in view of the publication of the amount of the loan to Turkey he did not want news to get abroad that he was being offered so meagre a credit compared with that given to Turkey. I repeated that it was unreasonable to compare Turkey with Saudi Arabia in this connexion. If we were spending- millions in Turkey there was, as I had said, a factor of self-interest. Turkey was for the Allies an outpost, a bulwark against the spread of the area of hostilities. The money was being spent not to help a friend in immediate need but to secure our own defence. The loan could almost be classed as expenditure on coastal defence. One could not conceive that Saudi Arabia would ever be called upon to act as a bulwark against an invader. If it did, against all present hope and belief, come into the war zone then, as I had informed His3 Maiesty that morning, our interests were identical with his own—it was of the highest importance to the British Empire that his kingdom should remain strong and independent and its integrity be unimpaired. 11. What, said Hafez Wahba, about a possible threat from Italy? I Repeated what I had been authorised to say : namely, that it was unthinkable nat Italy would break her agreement with us and risk war for the sake of annexing a portion of territory which could be of little value to her. I added that I had recently spent two years among the Italians in Italian East Africa, and that my personal opinion was that Italy had her hands full and could not afford to launch forth on new adventures. If this war was a tragedy to the rest of the world it was a god-send to Italy, who could hope, if she remained neutral, to repair some of the serious gaps made in her financial structure by her adventures in Italian East Africa. Moreover, if Italy wished to keep her empire, it was vitally necessary for her to have unimpeded access to the Red Sea for the purpose of restocking herself not only in petrol and food-stuffs which could perhaps be stored but in man-power which needed, owing to the climate, to be constantly renewed. Hafez Wahba thought that this would interest the King and help to allay his apprehensions. I hoped, though I refrained from say mg so to Sheikh Hafez, that it might head the King off from the snag of his request for a specific guarantee against aggression. 12. As reported in my telegrams Nos. 21, 22 and 23 I saw the King again on the morning of the 4th February. 1 spoke first about the question of credit in the terms of my conversation with Sheikh Hafez Wahba, reported in para graphs 7, 8 and 9 above. The King talked for some time about the large sums we had spent on King Hussein during the war of 1914—18 and of the part that he, Ibn Saud, had played in the war. His share in the reward was not great, but he had been happy to receive it as a present from a friend. He was a very old friend, the Turks were new friends acquired for the needs of the moment. Ibn Sand’s point is, I gathered from this conversation and from my talks with Mr. de Gaury, that in time of war the potential enemy gets the money and the friend whose loyalty and co-operation are assured gets an expression of gratitude. He said that if he were to remain strong in his own country, as His Majesty’s Government wished him to be, he must be generous in his distribution of food and money to his tribes. As I knew, the revenues of his country were insignificant and even in a good pilgrimage year barely met necessary expenditure. However, as long as he felt that he could rely on His Majesty’s Government to afford material assistance if he required it in future years he would like me to put forward my suggestion about an unrestricted credit for £200,000 to be repaid after the war. He would spend the money on the purchase of food-stuffs and some perhaps on arms which His Majesty’s Government might perhaps sanction his buying in the neutral market if they themselves could not supply his requirements. I thanked him and said that whatever assistance it would be found possible to give he must not regard the sum as he had appeared to do yesterday as a measure of His Majesty’s Government’s appreciation of his friend ship. The value of his friendship could not be reckoned in terms of sovereigns. 13. He then wished me to talk to him about the guarantee of non-aggression for which he had asked. I replied that His Majesty’s Government trusted that he would have confidence in them and would not press them for a specific guarantee. I used the arguments with which your Lordship was good enough to supply me and repeated much of what I had said to Hafez Wahba regarding Italy’s position in the present struggle. The King appeared to be entirely satisfied and Hafez Wahba, whom I saw after the interview, confirmed my impression that he would not press for a specific guarantee. 14. I feel that Ibn Saud, by his rejection of Grobba, by his acceptance of a general verbal assurance in lieu of a specific guarantee, ancl by his readiness to accept a much smaller credit than he felt the safety of his position required, has shown both loyalty and understanding and I sincerely trust that I may be authorised to inform him that His Majesty’s Government have agreed to my proposal for a £200,000 credit and a promise of further help if and when requirei during the period of hostilities. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD.x 4 Enclosure 1. Mr. Stonehewer-Bird to King 'Abdul Aziz. Your Majesty, Jedda, February 2, 1940. HIS Excellency Sheikh Hafez Wahba on the 18th January conveyed to at your Majesty’s command an acknowledgment of my letter of the 17th Januar^ regarding Dr. Grobba and at the same time requested me to communicate to the Government in the United Kingdom your Majesty’s views on this matter. On the 21st January Sheikh Hafez informed me that permission was not being granted to Dr. Grobba to return. I am authorised to inform your Majesty that the Government in the United Kingdom have learnt with interest of your attitude to Dr. Grobba’s visit and applaud the resolution with which your Majesty has acted. They feel that having taken this stand it is necessary for your Majesty’s dignity and from every point of view that you should abide by it. They are convinced that you need have no apprehensions about the consequences. It is almost unthinkable to suggest that Italy would break the Middle East Agreement and risk war with Great Britain for the sake of German representation in Saudi Arabia. The Govern ment in the United Kingdom have always tried to advise your Majesty in your own best interests. In this case the advice was based on the sincere belief that the misunderstandings to which the reception of a diplomat of Dr. Grobba’s reputation would give rise and to the offensive which he might attempt would be as embarrassing and dangerous for your Majesty as for the Government in the United Kingdom. Had they had the slightest grounds to suppose that a refusal might have serious consequences they would certainly have warned your Majesty. If, nevertheless, your Majesty feels that Italian retaliation is possible they invite you to read again paragraph 6 of the letter which the Prime Minister addressed to your Majesty on the 23rd March and also paragraph 2 of Sir Reader Bullard’s letter of the 30th April. The Government feel that these two messages will show that they regard your Majesty’s interests as their own. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD. Enclosure 2. Mr. Stonehewer-Bird to King 'Abdul Aziz. Your Majesty, Jedda, February 2, 1940. IN addition to the question of Dr. Grobba’s reception, on which I have addressed a separate letter to your Majesty, his Excellency Sheikh Hafez Wahba raised other matters on which he stated your Majesty wished to learn the views of the Government in the United Kingdom. I duly communicated with the Government and have now received their reply. I am able to assure your Majesty that the Government in the United Kingdom have complete confidence in your Majesty’s loyalty. They fully realise the difficulties which have beset your path in recent years. For your numerous marks of friendship they are and will always be grateful. Your Majesty will understand the difficulties which now face the Government in the United Kingdom. They are studying the possibility of supplying arms and ammunition but regret that they cannot hold out very strong hope that they will be able for the present to meet your Majesty’s request in this matter. On the other hand, I am happy to be able to inform your Majesty that the Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to meet bills for food-stuffs purchased in India up to £100,000 sterling. Details regarding charges, &amp;c., and arrangements for repayment can be settled later. Meanwhile the existing offer of credit for £85,000 for purchase of arms remains open. I am to add that His Majesty’s Government will always consider sympathetically suggestions for securing the prosperity of Saudi Arabia, but in this connexion it will be appreciated that while the resources of His Majesty’s Government may appear considerable the demands on these resources are enormous.

Dear Syers, Copies of Jedda telegrams Nos. 21, 22 and 23 of the 5th February about the quef tion of financial assistance to Ibn Saud have already been sent to the Treasury under cover of our official letter E 515/252/25 of the 7th February, 2. You will see that Stonehewer-Bird recommends that we should offer Ibn Saud what he calls a ‘'loan” (although I do not think he is using the word in any technical sense) of £200,000 in all, including the £100,000 already offered for purchases in India and the £85,000 similarly offered for arms, this £200,000 to be^ at Ibn Saud ! s free disposal and to be given on the understanding that next year (meaning, presumably, after the 1st January, 1941^ Ibn Saud’s further needs will be favourably considered. /3 C.G.L. Syers, Esq.., Treasury*3, If we accept this offer, we shall, all things considered, have got off very cheaply. But I have a feeling that if we do so we may still find that the necessities of Ibn Baud’s financial position will oblige us to give him further help before the end of the current year. If, however, we were now to offer him a larger loan than £800,000 in all (e.g. if we were to say that we would give him £200,000 apart from the offer of £85,000 to be used for arms, if and when any arms become available) this might look to him rather like an admission on our part that the original offer of £100,000 was rather niggardly and in the nature of a try-on, and that, in view of his reaction, we had increased it to a figure nearer what w'e were always prepared to give him if he pressed us to do so - in other words, that we had been doing a bazaar bargain. 4. On the whole, therefore, we are disposed to feel that it would be better to endorse the arrangement which Stonehewer-Bird recommends, but with the mental reservation that, even so, circumstances may arise which will oblige us to use the remainder of the sum originally recommended by /thethe Committee of Imperial Defence as the 'initial payment' (see our official letter E 285/297/25.cff the 24th January) before the current year is out. The balances of the initial payment' would, on the basis suggested b* £85,000. 5. I have just had a conversation on this subject with de Gaury, who was until recently with Ibn Saud at Riyadh. He stresses the point that Ibn Stud really needs help in the form of money for the money's sake - it is not merely a question of our making gestures which will satisfy him of our confidence and goodwill. He thinks that the present difficult economic situation in Saudi Arabia caused by the small pilgrimage and other circumstances, such as the inborn love of the people of that country for a share in the excitement which they believe to be going 0 n in other parts of the world, may quite well lead to a certain amount of internal disturbance. If Ibn Saud is to cope with this sort of thing, he will have to have funds, and I think that everyone agrees that it would be fatal if Ibn Saud were not able to maintain his authority. There is therefore every reason to believe that whatever nominal arrangements we may make now, we may have to make /furthertaken and vended now. further advances before the end of 19 that a decision in principle to this 6. The tain difficulty seems likely to arise over deciding what meaning is to be given to the words 'at 'Ibn Saud's free disposal 1 '. 7. The original Committee of Imperial Defence recommendation spoke of a subsidy, and a subsidy presumably denotes an actual gift of money, i.e. in this case the presentation to Ibn Ssud of gold, or the equivalent of g»ia, to the value of £200,000 sterling, we can see that it may be very difficult at the present time to carry out the original intentions quite so literally as this. On the other hand, we feel that it will be necessary to go rather further than merely making sterling available for Ibn Saud's purchases anywhere he may like to place them within the sterling bloc. Gould we place sterling to his account in London to the value of £200,000, with an intimation that, although we cannot make our own supplies of foreign currencies, like dollars, available for any purchases for which he may want to use this money, we shall raise no objection to his changing(*S) it into foreign currencies, including his own, on his own account ancl by the usual methods, e.g. by selling the sterling to the London branch of a New York Bank and getting dollars placed to his account in New York? Actually, I do not think he will be able to get any arms either in the United States of America’ or anywhere else, except after tremendous delay, so the likelihood of his wanting to change much of this money into dollars is very small. 8. You will see that Bird has asked for a very early reply, and we should be very grateful if you could let us have the Treasury vie as soon as possible. 9. I am sending copies of this letter to the Chairman and Secretary of the Middle East Committee of the War Cabinet, to the departments represented on that committee and to Somerville Smith at the Export Credits Guarantee Department.In any further communioution on this subject, please quote No, and address— not to any person vy name, but to unicution on this subject, p ■ £-‘Si‘5h‘5y2Z '.ny person vy name, but to— '^i»e Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, Londorf, S.W. 1 Pile copy r '\ THE Under-Secretary o^^tate for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to _ (fj . an d’ by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop'Ji^O of ihe- mid(»r nmutimied paper.

I have had two long interviews with Ibn Saud and many talks with Hafiz Jahba on which I am reporting fully by despatch. 2 . Following summary snows results: King does not intend to change his mind about the reception of German representative but trusts that His majesty's Government will not think his action was taken w r ith a view r to his own material gain. He had asKed for assistance weeks before the question of Grobba arose. He had also, I replied, taken his decision without awaiting response of His majesty's Government to his appeal. As regards the guarantee I have I trust and believe succeeded in convincing Ibn Saud that though we cannot commit anything to paper in more explicit terms than those used in Prime Minister's and &gt; 033 / 3 ^ Sir Rt • l3ullard,s letters (your telegram N o. 69, 1 959) he can have full confidence in us. I made use of the most helpful material contained in paragraphs 2 ana 4 of Your Lordship’s telegram No. 11. I also used the argument in the last sentence of paragraph 7 of telegram No. 9 and spoke at length from my [grp. omitted] gleaned in Italian East Africa of Italy’s difficulties in coping with her existing commitments and consequent improbable [grp. omitted] of her launching forth on new and pointless adventures in the Red Sea. The/2 . The war, a tragedy for most nations, afforded Italy, for as long as she remained quiet, [2 grps. undec.] opportunity to repair the very serious breaches in her financial structure. d.

My immediately preceding telegram. xit first interview King showed bitter disappointment at offer of £100,000 credit for foodstuffs. He must, he said, reject it. His people and his enemies alike would say that this represented in His Majesty's Government^ eyes his value as a friend. His Majesty's Government did not understand. They wanted him to be strong in his own country. For this he must either distribute money and food generously or undertake punitive expeditions. He needed for the duration of the war, when his better revenue would be further reduced by falling off in the pilgrimage, credit for at least £800,000 . He did not want to use it now but he needed it to allay the fears of his people for the future. He ended his forcible though entirely good-natured harangue by smiling, saying that 'even if I do not get a penny I am still your friend'. 2. I could only say I would report to His Majesty's Government /2. y,* fU* ^ |&gt;viAdcU *U&gt;* ^J- Wvw^vvtvfrvvft C&lt;M&lt;vh • ) Government what he had said, and it was decided to leave the question for further discussion on the next day. I asked Hafiz Wahba to come and see me before my next interview and learnt that the King was worried on two counts. One, the meagreness of his reward as an old friend and compared with that of our new friend Turkey, two, publicity. Everyone 'would know that His Majesty's Government was paying his bills in India and would know the low limit. If he had hesitated to use the arms credit it was because the [grp. undec.] of the loan to Turkey had been published and odious comparisons would have been drawn. 3. I told Hafiz Wahba that I saw little hope of His Majesty's Government being a Hji) provide a credit of £800,000. £100,000 could be regarded as a loan between friends, but higher figure meant a full-dress commercial transaction with awkward questions of security etc., In one respect, however, I thought we could meet the King. His Majesty's Government might perhaps agree (please see paragraph 4 of your telegram No, 10) not to tie Ibn Saud down as to the manner in which he used the money and thus avoid publicity consequent on Indian purchase arrangement. Hafiz Wahba agreed that this would help, especially if £85,000could similarly be freed and the total figure raised by £15,000 to £200 ; 000. 4. My subsequent interview 'with Ibn Saud forms the subject of my immediately following telegram.

My imiiedlately preceding telegram, I saw the King yesterday morning and told him that I had thought over the matter of credits and feared that in the light of my instructions it was useless *to ask for £800,000* immediate credit. Perhaps we could agree on a proposal more in keeping with that of His Majesty's Government 0 I then suggested as a purely personal idea that I should ask you to open a free credit for him for £200,000 this year and consider sympathetically his needs if any next year. 2. He launched forth into a lengthy talk about his long friendship and Turkey's now friendship ~ the old friendship was fobbed off with a pittance and the old enemy received £60,000,0000 I said he must not draw this comparison. What His Majesty's Government ?[was] specially offering him was a loan to a friend in temporary difficulties, the loan to Turkey was a commercial transaction^ Moreover sum loaned to Turkey was in the nature of expenditure on our own defence. Turkey stood as a rampart against the spread of hostilities to the Middle Hast. Saudi ^rabia was not and we hoped never would be in the zone of hostilities.2 . 3c I suggested that if anyone criticised the size of his credit he could say that that wa\ all he needed at the moment, if he wanted more next year he would appeal once again to the generosity of his friends c 4, He finally agreed that if he were offered a credit for £200,000 unrestricted as to its use and if hopes were held out that his needs next year would receive sympathetic consideration he would gratefully accept«, He asked that the matter might he concluded most urgently as within the next few days the new year began and he must make his purchases of foodstuffs and distribute presents. hS regards arms he hoped His Majesty's Hoveinment would not object to his purchasing them if possible from neutral markets out of credit* 5. I sincerely trust that it may prove possible to give immediate effect to my proposal 0 Ibn 3aud has refused to accept Grobba or any other German. He has agreed to trust us and not to press for a written guarantee* A satisfactory solution to these two problems was regarded as being of highest importance and I am confident that you will agree that the granting of a loan of £200,000 entailing as it does a mere addition of £15,000 to the existing sums earmarked as credits, is a minimum return for these signal marks of Ibn Baud's loyalty and confidence.

I am not sure how far this telegram supersedes your telegrams Nos. 15 and 16 [of the 18th January], but I propose to reply -on assumption (a) that if the Italo-German reaction to Ibn Baud's refusal to receive a German representative is very strong, he may renew his request for a guarantee and (b) that in any event he needs and expects material assistance. It is on this basis that the following observations are made. 2. In refusing to receive not only Dr. Grobba but any German representative Ibn Baud has taxen a very strong step and now that he has taken it on his own responsibility His Majesty's Government think he should be encouraged to persist in it. They are satisfied that if he does so he will have nothing to fear. 3. As regards a guarantee, His Majesty's Government clearly cannot let Ibn Baud think they would fail to protect him from the consequences of a decision which he doubtless regards as in accord ance with their wishes.

TO; SAUDI ARABIA Cypher telegram to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird (Jedda) Foreign Office, 30th January, 1940 , 6.40 p.m. No. 9. G Q 4 /Their/6. ^eir hands as to precise manner in which they would uphold Saudi interests in circumstances v/hich cannot now he foreseen or, for the reasons indicated helow, to give more precise assurances than 4. Sixth paragraph of Prime Minister’s letter of the 23rd J March 1939 and paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 69 [of the 27th I 'April 1939] contain broadest possible hints that His Majesty s Government would have to help Ibn Saud if attacked. But His Majesty's Government have hitherto refrained from being e}q)lioit. Main reason has been possible Italian suspicion that spirit of Middle Pastern Agreement was being violated. Moreover explicit guarantee would raise numerous incidental problems e.g. whether it was personal to Ibn Baud, period of validity, against whom it was valid, etc, A further objection is that Ibn Saud would probably expect protection directly he was threatened, whereas His Majesty's Government might wish to wait until the necessary operations could be fitted into their general strategic plans. 5. At this time there are even graver objections to being explicit. Circumstances may arise compelling His Majesty’s Govern ment to defend integrity and independence of Saudi Arabia by force of arms even while still engaged in a major war elsewhere. But ways in which these might be threatened cannot all be foreseen; and so long as the war in fact continues His Majesty’s Government must keep their hands absolutely free to deal with breaches of Middle Astern Agreement, as with all other Anglo-Italian questions, as the needs of the moment ™ay require- To do otherwise would be to run risks which it is not even in Ibn Baud's own interest that they should do./8. ... 3 6, If assurance of some kind had now to he given, the best would be adjioc assurance that if Italy retaliated for refusal of Dr, Grobba by attacking Ibn baud or seizing any part of his territory His Majesty's Government would come to his assistance. It is unlikely, however, that Italy would do anything so simple as to ’’attack' or 'seize”, so that even this formula might have effect of embroiling His Majesty's Government with Italy in some unforeseen manner at a dangerous moment. 7. The objections of His Majesty's Government to complicating their diplomacy with Italy are however of a general character. So far as this particular incident is concerned, it seems unlikely that untoward results need be apprehended. If Italy were to try conclusions with this country she might violate Saudi Arabian territory (though it is difficult to see what she would gain by it) in the course of local operations and if she were eventually victorious she might dominate Saudi Arabia altogether. If, moreover, she were convinced that nothing she could do would win Ibn Saud from his friendship for Great Britain she might intrigue against him among his own people. But it is difficult to believe that pending the success of such intrigues she would deliberately prejudice her relations with a ruler whose good will would be of importance in any policy of adventure, or a for tiori break Middle Eastern Agreement and risk war with Great Britain, merely because Ibn Saud refused a German representative.4 8. It is not easy however to reconcile reluctance to give explicit assurances with an assertion that circumstances in which they would have to he made good are never likely to arise, and in order to avoid accusation that His Majesty’s Government are encouraging Ibn Hand to run risks from which they are unwilling to protect him it seems essential that you should at need make it clear that whatever he may feel compelled to do in this connexion hereafter he will not forfeit their friendship. 9. Meanwhile I shall he glad if you will, if you see no objection reply in following terms: 10. His Majesty’s Government have learnt with interest of Ibn Baud’s attitude to Dr. Grohha’s visit, and applaud the resolution with which he has acted. Having taken his stand they tnink it necessary for his own dignity and from every point of view that he should stick to it. They are convinced that he need have no apprehensions about the consequences. It is almost unthinkable that Italy would break Middle Eastern Agreement and risk war with Great Britain for the sake of German representation in Saudi Arabia. His Majesty’s Government have always tried to advise Ibn Saud in his own best interests. In this case advice was based on sincere belief that misunderstandings to which reception of a diplomatist of Dr. Grobba's reputation would give rise, and intrigue which he might attempt, would be as embarrassing and dangerous for Ibn Saud as for His Majesty’s Government. If they had had slightest ground to suppose /thatthat refusal might have serious consequences they would certainly have warned him. If Ihn Saud feels that Italiaji retaliation is nevertheless possible they invite him to read again the assurances contained in messages referred to at beginning of paragraph 4 above. They think these two messages will show Ibn Saud that they regard his interests as their own. 11. See also my two immediately following telegrams. Addressed Jedda No. 9.

' IIBUTIQN. To SaUDI 1940 ) Cypher telegram to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird (Jedda) Foreign Office 31st January, 1940. 5.0 p.m. No. 10 WWW My telegram No. [of January Ibn Baud's request for assurance against aggression]. I am impressed by Ur. de Gaury's letter to Mr. Tro*tt of December 18th and can understand Ibn Baud's feelings. As a matter of fact His Majesty’s Government need little from him at present, except that he should be strong in his own territory and adopt a general attitude of benevolent neutrality. But I recognise that for the first of these things at any rate he may need material assistance. 2. As you know from correspondence enclosed in my despatch No. 1 [of January 1st] Jar Office cannot at present release any arms or ammunition, although they may later be able to offer some 200 Hotchkiss guns. By comparison with most countries, hov 7 ever, Ibn Baud is in no danger of foreign attack. Unless therefore you have serious ground to think that his internal security is in danger owing to lack of arms. His Majesty's Government must continue for the present, with minor exceptions, to use war material at their disposal for countries nearer fighting line.2 . Cm) 3* His Majesty's Government are ready, however, to help Ibn Saud in financial sphere, dhey cannot now grant credits for so much as £250,000 gold, but in addition to existing offer of credit of £85,000 for arms (which remains open until such time as Ibn Saud can find something to buy with it) they are prepared to make payments for the account of the Saudi Arabian Government to the extent of £100,000 sterling for use in India. Details as to interest (which would be described as charges), period, etc, will be worked out later, but general idea would be that His Majesty’s Government would meet bills for foodstuffs to that amount. Beyond this I can make no promises at present, except that further suggestions for helping Saudi Arabia (including those put forward by Mr, de Gaury and by Mr. Trott in his covering letter) will be sympathetically considered, 4. In precedin , paragraph I have avoided speaking of ‘‘subsidy' 1 , as to do so seems more consonant with Ibn Baud's self-respect. But His Majesty’s Government have no illusions as to prospects of repayment. Moreover, although His Majesty's Government v/ould prefer to have money spent on something like foodstuffs, which would be of use to the population of Saudi Arabia, they will put it at Ibn Saud's disposal for other purposes, if you think that political advantage might be gained thereby, 6. You may therefore inform Ibn Saud that while His Majesty’s Government willsee what can be done in matter of arms and ammunition they cannot hold out great hopes in this direction. They win however meet bills for foodstuffs/foodstuffs purcnased in India up to £100,000 sterling, • details as to charges etc. and as to machinery for payment being arranged later. Meanwhile existing offer of credit of £05,000 for arms remains open and in addition His Majesty T Cover raent will always consider sympathetically further suggestions for securing prosperity of Saudi ^rabia, subject to general warning that while their resources may seem considerable, the demands upon those resources are enormous.

I realise that replies about guarantees and material assistance contained in these telegrams may not by themselves give Ibn Baud that assurance that His Majesty's Government appreciate his friendship for which he evidently hankers. I therefore authorise you at your discretion to speak on lines indicated in paragraphs 2 to 4 below in confidential conversa tion, should an opportunity to do so present itself. If you can conveniently await my reply to sir Reader Bullard’s despatch N o. 160 [of the 15th November] this may give you some useful supplementary guidance, particularly as what is said below also applies to a great extent to Ibn Baud’s proposals for Arab co-operation. But this is not essential. I give you full latitude as to manner in which you present your argument, as last thing I wish is to give impression that His Majesty's Government are irritated by Ibn Baud’s constant suggestions and requests for assurances.. Their difficulties go far deeper than that. 2. His • • *free • 9 t 2. His Majesty's Government have complete confidence in Ibn Sand's loyalty* They realise to the full how difficult is the path which he has followed over Palestine, for instance, during the last few years, For this and numerous other marks of friendship they are and always will be grateful. But it is not only a question of loyalty and gratitude* Just as Ibn Baud has explained his friendship for His Majesty's Government in terms of his own interests, so His Majesty f s Government can explain their friendship for him in terms of their own interests, Per their own sakes they want him to maintain his present dominions, to retain his own power within those dominions, and in due course to pass on his power undiminished to his son. All their influence will always be exerted to these ends, for if things happened otherwise the ensuing con fusion would be very dangerous for themselves and their policy. 3. His Majesty's Government hope that in return Ibn Baud will have confidence in them. They see as clearly as he does the dangers which threaten his interests as v/ell as theirs from so many quarters, and they are as anxious as he is to provide for and avert these dangers. But in these days they are pursuing a course where a single false step may have momentous consequences. This applies not only to their relations with Great Powers like Italy and the Soviet Union but also to many smaller Powers, some of them neighbours of Ibn Saud's, whose conflicting interests and wishes His Majesty’s * Government must reconcile as best they can. For his sake as well as their own, they must keep their hands absolutely5, free to conduct their diplomacy with all the skill they possess. For this reason they hope he will not press them too closely to give precise indications or assurances as to how they would act in various contingencies which have not yet arisen, and may never do so. Their ultimate aims are the same es his, to preserve the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia. But the manner of attaining these aims must depend upon innumerable factors which only the moment when it comes can disclose* 4, His Majesty 1 s Government prefer to say these things frankly to Ton Baud rather than to offer him a formal guarantee so hedged around by conditions and reservations as to have little value. meanwhile they think they can say that so far as external dangers are concerned his position is safer today and (unless Great Britain were to be defeated by Germany) is likely to remain safer than that of any other ruler outside Americao Even if the war were to spread nearer the Middle East, Saudi Arabia would be likely to be the last country to be engulfed. Should the war do so, His Majesty's Government will not hesitate to let Ton Saud know if there is any way in which he could assist their common purpose, though they hope this necessity will not arise. For the rest they will do their best to assist him in any way they can in building up and stren^tbenine his country.

IN accordance with the instructions contained in paragraph 6 of the enclosure to Foreign Office circular of the 7th March, 1939, I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report, Economic (B), for this post. 2. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch and of the enclosed report to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. A nnual Report, Economic (B), for 1939. IN spite of the shadow of war, the economic condition of Saudi Arabia has developed on the lines foreshadowed in Annual Report, Economic (A), for 1938-39. The oil pipe-line was opened on the 1st May, and a new oil concession, giving to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company rights of oil develop ment over most, though not all, of the unallotted territory east of the Hejaz, was signed on the 31st May; it gave to the American company the Saudi oil rights in the Iraq and the Koweit neutral zones, and the area available for exploitation in Central and Eastern Arabia was increased. For this concession the companv had to pay £140,000 gold, with an annual rental of £20,000 gold and increased free deliveries of petrol; the royalties continue at the rate of As. gold per ton; and an extra £100,000 gold is to be payable when oil is discovered in commercial quantities in the extra areas allotted to the company by this concession. The concessionary company is displaying great activity throughout vast areas of hitherto unknown country; the principal area at present is the prolific high- pressure field at Dhahran, which is now producing about 10,000 barrels of oil per day, and may eventually produce as much as three times that amount. Test borings are also being made in the promising district of Abu Hadriya. At Ma aqala, only 140 miles from Riyadh, drilling for water is going on and drilling for oil may soon begin, though the long distance from the sea will complicate problems of transport. Ras Tanura is becoming an admirable oil port, with storage tanks and a loading terminal; a refinery on a small scale is beino- erected to get rid of excessive quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen in the crude oil Prospectors have been as far afield as the Rub’a ul Khali, Hail and Bureida Indications have been received that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company were casting eyes on the unallotted area of Bahrein, though this question has been disposed of for the present by the allotment of these areas to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The income derived by the King from an 10675—11 [20614]'1 output of 10,000 barrels per day is about £100,000 gold per annum; it will naturally be in the King’s interest to increase production, though questions of marketing and the interests of the Bahrein company may complicate that question. In contrast to this flourishing picture, the record of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) is gloomy; they have found no oil in^ the Hejaz and are thinking of giving up their option. The financial help which the new concession affords to the King’s schemes for a new army and general development needs no emphasis, though there has hitherto been no sign of its resulting in a reduction of the pilgrimage fees. Towards the end of 1939 the King obtained an advance from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company of 1 million United States dollars. 2. The second article of export in the King’s eyes must be the gold from his Mahd mine. The first shipment of gold concentrates left Jedda for America on the 22nd August; it consisted of 150 barrels, valued at 100,000 dollars, ^ince then other shipments have been made, though the war has interfered with the supply of cyanide, an essential ingredient in the extracting process. The original company, formed solely for the preliminary work of exploitation, has now written up its capital and transformed itself into an operating company, in which certain Saudis have been allowed to purchase shares. While a good dividend ought to be paid, it is unlikely that the capital will ever be paid off, and the yield of gold per ton of ore is found to he not twelve, as originally hoped, but seven or eight pennyweights. 3. A committee of irrigation experts from Iraq examined the so-called bottomless wells of Kharj. not far from Riyadh, during the summer. Their report, as published in the press, does not read as though the authors were in the front rank of irrigation engineers, but large centrifugal pumps are being introduced in the hope of irrigating a 100 square kilometres of desert. An American driller criticised this operation as likely to exhaust the present supply and do harm to the strata in which the water collects; he recommended small lift pumps as better suited to the local water supply. The press reports that 10,000 palm trees have been planted on the newly irrigated area, and that fruit trees as well as more palms are to be added. 4. Drillings for artesian water at Riyadh, by drillers of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, have not yet been successful. They have drilled down to 2,400 feet, and the King wishes them to go still further. On the other hand abundant supplies of artesian water have been found at Qatif, Jubeila, and other places in the Hasa area. Water supply at Jedda remains the same, except that new boilers have been obtained for the condensers. 5. While nothing has been done about the railway, a step forward has been made about the roads of the Hejaz. An agreement between Egypt and Saudi Arabia was actually signed at Jedda on the 5th October, concerning the construction of the roads from Jedda to Mecca, from Mecca to Arafat, and from Jedda to Medina (in part), as well as water and electricity schemes at Mecca. The work is to be done under Egyptian supervision and advice, Saudi labour being used as much as possible. The road schemes are to cost £E. 145,000 in all, of which £E. 60,000 is said to exist in cash as the result of three years’ collection of road tax from pilgrims at £E. 20,000 per yeai, the rest is to be paid for at the rate of £E. 20.000 per year till it is liquidated. The water and electricity schemes are to cost £E^ 100,000. Provision is made for training Saudis in Egypt with a view to employment on road construction. An Egyptian bacteriologist is to inspect the water. Haramain funds in Egypt are to be devoted to the work, and there seems no reason why actual construction should not begin. But it has not begun yet. 6. The Arab Car Company has produced its annual financial statement. It shows reduced receipts, owing to the smaller number of pilgrims in the 1938-39 pilgrimage; the number of cars on its effective list has decreased to 605; the rate of depreciation of cars is now declared as 10 per cent, for new cars and 20 per cent, for cars more than one year old; the big Mecca garage has been built, and the company runs a town service at Mecca. Two Diesel lorries were bought in 1938 at £580 gold each; they were fitted up for watering streets or fire-fighting, hut little of either has been done. The annual statement mentions the cessation of the monopoly of importation of cars, motor tyres and accessories which was3 formerly held by Mr. Philby’s Sharquieh (Limited). (It is doubtful whether that monopoly was ever strictly observed, and Messrs. Sharquieh say they get on just a^s well in importing Ford cars without it.) The share capital of the Arab Car Company is put down as 6,880 shares of one gold pound each. There is also a ^debt to the Ministry of Finance of some 2^ million Saudi piastres. On the assets side of the balance sheet there is one item of 1,780,000 piastres owed by the Nejdi Car Company: a somewhat doubtful asset. Since the publication of the report more Dodge and some Bussing-Nag lorries have been imported, and some thirty 30-cwt. lorries mounted with machine guns for mobile defence. The Chevrolet agents have also sold some cars. 7. I he unfortunate barter transaction with Germany (Saudi lambskins for German goods) ended dismally; the expensive Mercedes-Benz motor vehicles had not all arrived when war broke out. About ten cars had arrived, but the two ambifiances and a fire engine are likely to remain undelivered for some time. 8. Wireless telephone communications, with apparatus supplied through the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, between Taif and Riyadh were formally inaugurated by a conversation between the King speaking at Riyadh and the Amir Feisal at Fail, on the 24th June. His Majesty hoped that it would be the first step in linking up all the districts of his kingdom with wireless telephones. The oil surveyors, as well as the Mahd mine, make extensive use of this method of communication, and there are wireless telephone sets now installed at Qatif, Qariah and Hafr. three stations in Hasa. as well as elsewhere. 9. In the complete absence of any published Government accounts, it is difficult to say much about Saudi finance and currency. During the summer it was proposed to open a branch of the Netherlands Trading Society at Dhahran, but the project fell through and the considerable number of American oil producers in Hasa have to manage as best they can with the Eastern Bank at Bahrein. The Minister of Finance raised the question of a national bank for Saudi Arabia in August; he asked whether any British institution would take on the tasks of financing the Government’s operations and maintaining the stability of the currency, and the question is being examined. The Government, through the Minister of Finance, bought some shares in the Mahd mine. The Ministry of Finance has also shown an encouraging interest in the affairs of Hejazi merchants. The very high customs dues were reduced by 20 per cent, early in the summer, and although this concession was stated to be temporary, it has already been extended more than once, and is now in force till the end of the Arabic year next February. Ft also applies to importations into Nejd ports. Measures of assistance to Hejazi traders also included the grant of advances to exporters, and of a period in which to pay customs dues instead of paying them at once. Under the heading “ finance ” one other item must be mentioned : the purchase of £80.000 worth of arms from Italy, delivered in October 1939. 10. Flie immediate effect of the outbreak of war was to cause a small panic among local merchants, leading them to withdraw all the gold they could from * the Netherlands Trading Society. Prices rose in proportion to the sterling value of gold, and though efforts were made to stabilise prices at their pre-war level and to equate the Saudi riyal to the rupee, both of these admirable proposals were rather unsuccessful. The Government showed signs of apprehension about 'old by prohibiting its export on the 6th October; they also made arrangements through the good offices of the Government of India to ensure the receipt of large sums of gold owed them by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. A loan of a million dollars as an advance against future royalties was also obtained by the Government. In fact, the Government seem to have taken all possible measures to discount the loss of revenue which will certainly be a feature of the comino pilgrimage. One disquieting feature of the financial situation at the end of the period under review was the fact that sterling, either in the form of cheques or of notes, was almost impossible to exchange in local exchange institutions, though the Egyptian pound was more negotiable. Prices, however, showed a tendency to drop when it was discovered that food-stuffs from India and elsewhere were not limited in any way; and the promises of any help that might be necessary in facilitating the shipment of commodities, which were generously made by'the Government of India, will have reassured the Saudi Government.E 285/252/25 Immediate. r i FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. j 24th January, 1940. Sir, I am directed hy Viscount Halifax to transmit to you, herewith, to he laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, copies of two telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda (Nos. 15 of the 18th January and 18 of the 21st January) in the first of which Mr. Stonehewer-Bird reports inter ali a that Ibn Saud desires a credit of £250,000 gold for the purchase of foodstuffs in India. The preceding telegrams in this correspondence have already been sent to the Treasury in Foreign Office letter E 223/112/65 of the 22nd January and earlier letters. 2. Their Lordships will recollect that at their 347th meeting on the 16th February 1939 the Committee of Imperial Defence accepted certain recommendations of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee upon measures to influence Arab States and Minor Powers on the outbreak of a European war involving the United Kingdom. Among these recommendations was one to the effect that: 'His Majesty’s Government should be prepared to contemplate a subsidy to Ibn Saud, in whatever form and at whatever time His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda recommends/ The Secretary to the Treasury.recommends such an offer. We suggest an initial payment of not more than £200,000.' Other recommendations referred to measures to provide Ihn Saud with arms, ammunition and military equipment and to assistance in pilgrimage matters. 3. When the war broke out, however, it 'became apparent that Ibn Baud's good-will did not need to be bought and Sir Reader Bullard before his departure from Jedda expressed the opinion on more than one occasion, and notably in three despatches dated the 31st October, the 13th November and the 14th November, 1939, respectively that no subsidy as such was yet necessary. Sir Reader Bullard also drew attention, however, to Ibn Saud's financial situation andihile giving certain reasons for stating that this might not be so bad as it seemed, added a c aveat to the effect that financial assistance might shortly have to be considered. Copies of these three despatches were sent to the ireasury under cover of Foreign Office letter E 7812/G of the 12th January, v/hich expressed Lord Halifax's opinion that in view of the inability of His Majesty's Government to provide Ibn Saud with arms, and of his heavy commitments to other governments, it might be necessary in the near future to consider the question of a subsidy, although His Lordship did not ask for a definite decision at that time. 4. The need for a decision has now arisen, rather more suddenly and in a somewhat different form from what was expected. In addition to the very clear indications/indications of what Ihn Saud expects contained in Mr, Stonehewer-Bird*s telegram^No.15 of the 18th January referred to in the opening paragraph, a report has heen received from Mr* de Gaury (see Foreign Office letter E 183/183/25 of the 20th January) which throws a considerable amount of light on Ibn Saud’s state of mind. 5. The upshot of these reports seems to be that in spite of a substantial advance on account of future royalties which he has recently received from the Galifornia-Arabian Standard Oil Company and of the large sums which, notwithstanding a prospective temporary reduction in their production programme, he is likely to draw from that company in future years, and in spite also of the fact that the pilgrimage has not been so small as was feared at one time, Ibn Saud is at present in serious straits for money. 6. In these circumstances Lord Halifax is satisfied that the time has come when the recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be carried out. In his opinion this is necessary not only psychologically to restore the confidence of Ibn Saud, who evidently feels that His Majesty’s Government have been inclined to take his support rather too much for granted, but practically to ensure that his power and authority within his own dominions, which are of the utmost consequence to His Majesty's Government, shall in no wise be diminished. The last point is especially important/important, since indications have 'been received which suggest that the German Government, possibly v/ith the connivance of the Italian Government, may despair of being able to win Ibn Saud from his friendship for Great Britain and try instead to suborn some of his tribes, or even some of his own family who in the ordinary way are out of the running for the succession. If German or Italian money is spent in these ways Ibn Saud will need money to counter it, and it is essential he should have it. 7. It is moreover important that action should be taken without delay. In order, therefore, that matters may be simplified as much as possible, I am to suggest that His Majesty’s Government should offer Ibn Saud a credit to the full amount contemplated by the Committee of Imperial Defence for the initial payment of the subsidy i.e. £200,000 sterling for some definite purpose such as the purchase of foodstuffs in India. This does not mean that Lord Halifax would not like to be able to meet Ibn Saud in the matter of war material (about which there has already been considerable discussion^ between the War Office and Foreign Office) or in some of the other ways suggested in the correspondence, or that he would not like to be able to offer Ibn Saud a credit approaching more closely to the figure of £250,000 gold for which he has asked. But the discussion and examination of these questions will take time, and His Lordship thinks it will be better to discuss and examine them, as well as the question of further/further payments of the subsidy, after the decision which is immediately required has been taken. 8. I am also to suggest that the details of the credit, such as the machinery by which the money is to be advanced, the rate of interest and the period of repayment, should be left for later consideration. His Lordship hopes that the details may in any case be made as simple as possible. It seems desirable that in form the money advanced should be a credit or a loan but in point of fact the prospects of its ever being repaid will be very small, so that for practical purposes it may be regarded as a subsidy. 9. In order that Their Lordships may see the course of action which Lord Halifax has in mind, I am to enclose the accompanying drafts of three telegrams which he proposes, subject to the views of the other departments concerned, to address to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, and to express the hope that the concurrence of Their Lordships may be signified at a very early date. 10. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty,' War Office, Air Ministry, Colonial Office and India Office and to the Chairman and Secretary of the Middle East Official Committee of the War Cabinet. A copy is also being sent to the Export Credits Guarantee Department. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,COPY. r\ AMENDED COPY. GENERAL DIST RI BUTION. Prom SAUDI-ARABIA. Decypher.

Hafiz Wahbe. called on me this morning. He told me that he had had a long talk with Ibn Saud in Mecca and that he had been instructed to acknowledge receipt of my note and to put the King’s views and wishes before me. 2. The Italian Minister, the King had told him, had been almost threatening in his talk with the Amir Feisal. Mussolini had given his word to Hitler that he would use his best endeavours to ensure the return of Grobba. If Ibn Saud refused he was making an enemy not only of Hitler, but of Mussolini. Ibn Saud said that he could only risk incurring the hostility of Italy when convinced that His Majesty’s Government would come to his aid if he were in danger, e.g. if the Italians tried to annex Asir. 3c He had had long talks with-Sir R.Bullard and Mr. de Gaury and had protested his friendship and his loyalty to the British cause but he was in some doubt as to whether His Majesty’s Government has full confidence in him. He felt some tangible mark of their confidence /couldcould have heen given him* I replied that I had the privilege before leaving London of being received by Your Lordship, By Sir John Shuckburgh and by Mr.Butler and that I could assure him that, one and all, they expressed admiration and gratitude for the attitude His Majesty had adopted in most difficult circumstances. If His Majesty wanted tangible proofs of His Majesty's Government's confidence, I would submit for their sympathetic consideration any suggestions he could make. 4 0 Hafiz Wahba stated that what the King regarded as vital was a guarantee of assistance in the case of aggression against his territory by another Power. This he thought could conveniently take the shape merely of a note / ? preliminary to arranging for the__7 formal instrument to be published abroad 0 Hafiz Wahba was convinced that if the King could obtain such a promise of assistance he would refuse admittance to Grobba and risk Italian displeasure. 5 0 As regards immediate assistance Hafiz Wahba said that the King wanted arms and ammunition. I said that I had understood he had decided to wait till the end of the war. The King had, Hafiz Wahba said, merely said so because he had gained the impression that that was what His Majesty's Government would wish him to say, but he did want what he had asked for in Mr.Trott's telegram No,104 of August 2nd 1939 and he hoped they would be supplied- ^ or the occasion of Mr a Rendel's visit, at a nominal pricec 6« He also wanted a credit of £250,000 gold for the purchase of foodstuffs in India, The pilgrimage had /fallenfallen far* below expectations and the country’s finances were in a very bad way. I said I would put this proposal forward but that I should like to be able to give some indication of how the loan was to be guaranteed or repaid# Hafiz Wahba replied that the important thing was for us to be authorised to state that the question was having Your Lordship’s sympathetic consideration - that details could be discussed later. He added very earnestly 11 this is a very difficult moment for Saudi Arabia and a most favourable moment for His Majesty’s Government to show their generosity”# 7. As regards the feasibility of giving guarantee against aggression, tc the vital importance of which Hafiz Wahba constantly reverted, I can of course offer no opinion but I was entirely convinced that the advantage of gaining Ibn Saud’s wholehearted support far outweighed the possible loss of a proportion, or even the whole of the sum he asks and the inconvenience entailed in providing him with a comparatively insignificant quantity of arms and ammunition at a nominal price. 8. Hafiz Wahba said that the matter was very urgent as the Italians would return to the charge as soon as the pilgrimage was over on Monday.

Sheikh Hafiz Wahba informed me this evening that Ibn Saud had caused Italian Minister to be told for the information of Mussolini and German Government that he could not agree to allow Grobba to take up residence here.

Ibn Saud added that whilst he did not ^ T ish to sever diplomatic relations with Germany he equally did not wish to prejudice his friendly relations with Great Britain and France as might well result if he allowed Hitler to establish for the first time a Legation at Jedda when Germany was at war with friendly Saudi Arabia. 2.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.¥. 1. January, 1940. Despatched ' M. My telegrams Nos. and (of January : Ibn Baud’s request for assurance against aggression). I realise that replies about assurances and material assistance contained in these telegrams may not by themselves give Ibn Baud that assurance that His Majesty’s Government appreciate his friendship for which he evidently hankers. I therefore authorise you at your discretion to speak on lines indicated below in confidential conversation, should an opportunity to do so present itself. If you can conveniently await my reply to Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No. 160 (of the 13th November) this may give you some useful supplementary guidance, particularly as what is said bel ow also applies to a great extent to Ibn Baud’s proposals for Arab co-operation. But this is not/II not essentialo I give you full latitude ns to manner in which you present your argument, as last thing I wish is to give impression that His Maoesty r s Government are irritated by Ibn Saud’s constant suggestions and requests for assurances. Their difficulties go far deeper than that. 2 0 His Majesty’s Government have complete confidence in Ibn Saud’s loyalty. They realise to the full how difficult is the path which he has followed over Palestine, for instance, during the last few years. For this and numerous other marks of friendship they are and always will be grateful. But it is not only a question of loyalty and gratitude. Just as Ibn Saud has explained his friendship for His Majesty’s Government in terms of his own interests, so His Majesty’s Government can explain their friendship for him in terms of their own interests. For their own sakes they want/z CD K &lt; dominions, and in due course to pass on his pov/er undiminished to his son. All their influence will always he exerted to these ends, for if things happened otherwise the ensuing confusion v/ould he very dangerous for themselves and their policy. 3. His Majesty’s Government hope that in {/) X H Z z 111 h- t E 5 w m return Ihn Saud will have confidence in them. They see as clearly as he does the dangers which threaten his interests as well as theirs from so manj^ quarters, and they are O h CD Z X b o z as anxious as he is to provide for and avert these dangers. But in these days they are pursuing a course where a single false step may have momentous consequences. This applies not only to their relations with Great Powers like Italy and the Soviet Union hut also to many smaller Powers, some of them neighbours of Ibn Saud’s, v/hose conflicting Interests and wishes His Majesty's Government/ r- F • z 5 oc &lt; s tn x h z u H H X 5 UJ CQ o H O z X I- o z Government must reconcile as best they can. For his sake as veil as their own, they must keep their hands absolutely free to conduct their diplomacy with all the skill they possess. For this reason they hope he will not press them too closely to give precise indications or assurances as to how they would act in various contingencies v/hich have not yet arisen, and may never do so. Their ultimate aims are the same as his, to preserve the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia, But the manner of attaining these aims must depend upon innumerable factors which only the moment when it comes can disclose 4* His Majesty's Government prefer to say u-hese things frankly to Ibn Saud rather than to offer him a formal guarantee so hedged around by conditions and reservations as to have little value. Meanwhile they think they can say that so far as external dangers are concerned, his position is safer today and/and (unless G^eat Britain v/ere to be defeated by Germany) is likely to remain safer than that of any other ruler outside America, Sven if the war were to spread nearer the Middle -^ast, Saudi Arabia would oe likely to be the last country to be engulfed. Should the war do so, His Majesty's Government will not hesitate to let Ibn Baud know if there is any way in which he could assist their common purpose, though they hope this necessity will not arise. For the rest they will do their best to assist him in any way they can in building up and strengthening his country.NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN Registry No: E 285/207/25. JfaTA?' Telegram. Mrj. tonehewer-Bird, Jedda. No: Cypher. January, 1940. Despatched !:. Your telegram No. 18 /^of the 21st January: Dr. Grobba^/. I am not sure how far this telegram supersedes your telegrams Nos. 15 and 16 /“of the 13th Januarybut I propose to reply on assumption (a) that if the Xtalo—German reaction to Ibn baud's refusal to receive a German representative is very strong, he may renew his request for a guarantee and (b) that in any event he needs and expects material assistance. It is on this basis that the following observations are made. 2. In refusing to receive not only Dr. Grobba but any German representative Ibn baud has taken a very strong step and now that he has taken it on his own responsibility His(INOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. &lt;5^&gt; 16 His Majesty's Government think he should be encouraged to persist in it. They are satisfied that if he does so he will have nothing to fear. 3, As regards a guarantee, His Majesty’s Government clearly cannot let Ibn Saud think they would fail to protect him from the consequences of a decision which he doubtless regards as in accordance with their wishes. At the same time they have no wish to tie their hands as to precise manner in which they would uphold baudi interests in circumstances which cannot now be foreseen or, for the reasons indicated below, to give more precise assurances than are necessary* 4, Sixth paragraph of Prime Minister's letter of the 23rd March and paragraph 2 of my telegram No 0 69 /“of the 27th April 1939j? containz 5 K &lt; 5 cn i H Z LU H H 5 g u m contain broadest possible hints that His Majesty's Government would have to help Ibn baud if attackedo But Kis Majesty’s Government have hitherto refrained from being explicit. Main reason has been possible Italian suspicion that spirit of Middle .astern Agreement was being violated. Moreover explicit guarantee would raise numerous incidental problems e. g. whether it was personal to Ibn Gaud, period of validity etc. A further objection is that Ibn Baud would probably expect protection directly he was threatened, whereas His Majesty’s Government might wish to wait until the necessary operations could be fitted into their general strategic plans. 5, At this time there are even graver objections to being explicit. Circumstances may arise compelling His Majesty’s Government to defend integrity and independence of SaudiNOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. Saudi Arabia by force of arms even while still engaged in a major war elsewhere. But ways in which these might be threatened cannot all be foreseen; and so long as the war in fact continues His Majesty’s Government must keep their hands absolutely free to deal with breaches of Middle Eastern Agreement, as with all other Anglo-Italian questions, as the needs of the moment may require. To do otherwise would be to run risks which it is not even in Ibn Baud’s own interest that they should do. 6. If assurance of some kind had now to be given, the best would be ad hoc assurance that if Italy retaliated for refusal of Dr. Grobba by attacking Ibn Baud or seizing any part of his territory His Majesty’s Government would come to his assistance. It is unlikely* however, that Italy fNOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN.Italy would do anything so simple as to 'attack' or 'seize', so that even this formula might have effect of embroiling His Majesty’s Government with Italy in some unforeseen manner at a dangerous moment. 7. The objections of His Majesty’s Government to complicating their diplomacy with Italy are however of a general characterc bo far as this particular incident is concerned, it seems unlikely that untoward results need be apprehended. If Italy were to try conclusions with this country she might violate Saudi Arabian territory (though it is difficult to see what she would gain by it) in the course of local operations and if she were eventually victorious she might dominate Saudi Arabia altogether. If, moreover, she were convinced that nothing she could do wouldNOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. would win Ibn baud from his friendship for Great Britain she might intrigue against him among his own people. But it is difficult to believe that pending the success of such intrigues she would deliberately prejudice her relations with a ruler whose good will would be of importance in any policy of adventure, or a fortiori break Middle Eastern Agreement and risk war with Great Britain, merely because Ibn baud refused a German representative. 8. It is not easy however to reconcile reluctance to give explicit assurances with an assertion that circumstances in which they would have to be made good are never likely to arise, and in order to avoid accusation that His Majesty's Government are encouraging Ibn baud to run risks from which they are unwilling to protect him it seems essential that you should at need make it clear that whateverA ^ z 5 &lt; 0) X p z z 111 h E 5 LU OQ o H O z X I- o z whatever he may feel compelled to do in this connexion hereafter he will not forfeit their friendship. * 9 0 Meanwhile I shall be glad if you will, if you see no objection, reply in following terms: 10. His Majesty’s Government have learnt with interest of Ibn Saud’s attitude to Dr e Grobba’s visit, and applaud the resolution with which he has acted. Having taken his stand they think it necessary for hie own dignity and from every point of view that he should stick to it. They are convinced that he need have no apprehensions about the consequences. It is almost unthinkable that Italy would break Middle Eastern Agreement and risk war with Great Britain for the sake of German representation in baudi Arabia. His Majesty's Government have always tried to advise Ibn baud in his ownown best interests. In this case advice was based on sincere belief that misunderstandings to which reception of a diplomat of Dr. Grobba’s reputation would give rise, and intrigue which he might attempt, would be as embarrassing and dangerous for Ibn baud as for His Majesty’s Government. If they had had slightest ground to suppose that refusal might have serious consequences they would certainly have warned him. If Ibn baud feels that Italian retaliation is nevertheless possible they invite him to read again the assurances contained in messages referred to at beginning of paragraph 3 above. They think these two messages will show Ibn baud that they regard his interests as their own. 11. I am dealing separately with question of material assistance.

My telegram No. (of January Ihn 3aud*s request for assurance against aggression)# I am impressed by Mr# de Gaury*s letter to Mb* Trott of December 18th and can** 1 uiderstand Ibn Saud’s feelings. As a matter of fact His Majesty’s Government need little from him at present, except that he should be strong ii his ov/n territory and adopt a general attitude of benevolent neutrality. But I recognise that for the first of these things at any rate he may nped material assistance. 2. As you know from correspondence enclosed in niy despatch No.l (of January 1st) ' rr ar Office annot at present release any arms or ammunition, Ithough they may later be able to offer some 200 Hotchkiss guns. By comparison with most countries however, Ibn Saud is in no danger of foreign attael Unless therefore you fcave serious ground to think that his internal security is in danger owing to lack of arms, His Majesty’s Government must continue for the present, with minor exceptions, t« use war material at their disposal for countries njearer fighting line. 3. His Majesty’s Government are ready, however tjo help Ibn Saud in financial sphere. They annot now grant credits for so much as .£250,000 g(old, but in addition to existing credit of 85,000 for arms (which remains open until such ime as Ibn Saud can find something to buy with it' they/; 24- NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN they are prepared to open immediate credit of £200,000 sterling for use in India. Details as to interest, period, etc. will be worked out later, but general idea would be r that‘His Majesty's Government would meet bills for foodstuffs to that amount. Beyond this I can make no promises at present, except that further suggestions for helping Saudi Arabia (including those put forward by Mr. de Gaury and by Mr. Trott in his covering letter) will be sympathetically considered. 4. In preceding paragraph I speak of ’’credits” as this seems more consonant with Ibn Baud’s self-respect than a gift of money. But His Majesty’s Government have / no illusions as to prospects of repayment. Moreover, although His Majesty's Government would prefer to have money spent on something like foodstuffs, which would be of use to the population of Saudi Arabia, they w ill put it at Ibn Saud’s disposal for other purposes, if you think that political advantage might be gained thereby. 6.

The suggestion to which Sir R Bullard refers in para. 3 of his despatch of the 31st October, that a direct subsidy to the King was preferable to the performance of specific services, was not meant, so far as Lord Halifax is aware, to imply that a subsidy should not be given for a special purpose, but rather that His Majesty T s Government could not undertake to perform specific services on behalf of the King. Should, therefore, the need for a subsidy arise it might well be that the best method would be to provide Ibn Saud with the funds necessary for the execution of such projects as the building of roads or the maintenance of essential services. 3. As regards the supply of arms and ammunition, it would appear from para. 4 of the same despatch, that Ibn Saud is not at the moment anxious to acquire the arms ordered by him before the war, as he hopes that, if the Allies win a speedy victory, war material will be plentiful and cheap. None the less it would, in Lord Halifax’s opinion, be infinitely preferable to offer to release small quantities of rifles/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. : O WOLOeWI W WEEKLY LETTER NO. *5 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AMR SECRET DEPT. INDIA OfFHM “■ 'i —4, In view of* the inability of* His Majesty’s Government to provide arms, it may be necessary in the near future to consider as an alternative the question of a subsidy, more especially as Ibn Saud has heavy commitments to other Governments. He has, for instance, recently received a consignment of arms from Italy to the value of £80,000, and has also signed an agreement with the Egyptian Government for the construction of roads between Jedda, Mecca and Medina, at a total cost of £145,000. It is not, however, intended to ask for any decision on this question pending the receipt of a further report from H.M. Minister at Jedda. 5. The question of the reply to be returned to Sir R. Bullard’s despatch No. 160 of November 13th will be dealt with separately. A similar letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office, War Office, Air Ministry, Treasury and Admiralty. I am.3SCEEI. Unnvunbel’ed. 409 I ( Blitisn legation, T eocia* 14th 1939• iy lord, In say dospatch unnuabered dntad the 31st October, 1939, I exa dned the question wliether it was necessary to offer a subsidy to Ibn Saud, and cam© to tlie oonclusion that there vms no imediate necessity to do so. In a despatch which is being sent by the same bag I draw attention to a coaparison astute by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in a conversation with lr. hall, between the large loan which he believed Bis hajesty 1 © Bovernment were Mkiag to Turkey and their niggard** ly behaviour to the Arabs. Vihether tills was a hint that a subsidy ia wanted by I bn Baud remains to be seen. 2* I think it relevant to report a remark wade to lr. de Caury by r. lenaiian, the Jed da Manager of the California Arabia itimdawaL Oil Caa^any, l.td* said that mmg the niraoure aroused by the news that br. de Gaury ms going to biyadh was the tale that he was to take &lt; a huge subsidy to Ibn Baud. Lenahan said he hoped that the rumour was true, since unless His Aajesty , s Govermaent came to th© King’s rescue the California Arabia standard tky uj&lt;.+t. Oil Company would infallibly be called upon to do so soon# Mr* Lenahan seemed to leave out of hia calculation the considerable lump mm due to the King from the California Arabia Standard Oil Company tills year for their new con cession, and alao any reserve which the King my have in hand / (it is iiardly to be believed tliat he has not sortie l money in hand, in gold, for emergencies): so the Saudi .iTabian Government my be farther fraa bankruptcy than lie The Might Honourable The Viecount lialifaac. K*G., etc•, etc•, etc•, The Foreign Office. suggested.suggested. It is possible, however, that he has already been sounded by the l inistry of Finance about an advance on account of royalties, but he may have been merely recognising the fact to which he refers ruefully evory now and then, that the California Arabia standard Oil Company are obliged to do much for the King that is quite outside their contract, however difficult and costly it is, in order to keep on good terms with him* It is probable that any financial help given to Ibn Saud by the California Arabia standard Oil Company would be an advance rather than a subsidy, and could be justified on business grounds, even if it bore no interest. On the one hand the California Arabia Standard Oil Company are convinced that they have in Kasa a concession that is going to be extremely profitable to then; on the other, it would not suit them if Ibn Saud’s revenue diminished to such a point that he could not main tain his hold over the tribes. 3. &amp;r de Gaury, who left for Riyadh to-day, will be able to report on Ibn Baud’s financial situation, and whether the King is looking to ue for help in this respect. His Majesty's Government will then be able to consider the problem with the knovfledge that Ibn oaud is not entirely dependent on the bounty of Kis i&amp;jesty’s Government if pilgrim receipts fall to such a point as to create a serious deficit in his budget, but that he can probably obtain im portant advances from the California Arabia Standard Oil Company on the security of future royalties. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Ky Lord, Tour Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) R.W.Bullard.Concession* CASOC are arranging for the transfer of a quarter of a million in gold from India to the coffers of the Caudl Government*and with gold at its present price that sum will go far to make up for the falling off in the pilgrimage. Ibn 3aud has then some solid ground for optimism, but I fear that it is based partly on a belief that the war will have ter minated in favour of the Allies within a year, and if hostilities should be prolonged over a second pilgrim age season, his financial situation might begin to worry him seriously. 3. In paragraph four of the above-mentioned despatch Your Lordship expresses a preference x'or a direct subsidy to the &amp;ing rather than for the per formances of specific services in the country* The advantages of the direct subsidy are plain, and in any case no action is called for at present, but I should like to put my views on record for considerat ion in case of need* If the perforiamc© of a service would at the same time relieve the ^ing of expenditure which he would otherwise have to meet it would serve a double purpose. ij*or instance, under the road agree ment now finally concluded with the i^yptian Govern ment, Saudi Arabia has to produce sixty thousand .Egyptian pounds as her immediate contribution, dow this sum was collected from pilgrims by means of a special road tax during the last three years. I had understood that the money had been left at the Banque Misr,earmarked for the purpose for which it was collected,but I hear that it was withdrawn by the /SaudiSaudi Qovejmaont some time ago. How if we felt that Ibn Baud needed © subsidy* the payment of such © sum as this would give him help while ensuring the execut ion of a project of great value to British and other pilgrims. A similar project would be the maintenance of the Jedda condensers in action* by paying for spare parts or fuel. At least* some such ofrer would serve as a useful introduction to the question of a subsidy. 4. Paragraph five of Your ^ordship’s despatch refers to the possibility of assisting Ibn Baud in the matter of anas* ammunition*military equip ment and aviation. As Your -Lordship is aware* Ibn Baud was about to acqu^Be a large stock of rifles and arras from Germany, to be followed perhaps by other war material*when the outbreak of war caused him to decide not to proceed with the transaction, he has also decided, as the foreign Office were informed in Jecida telegram No.140 of October I7th.*to postpone a decisior ©bout the cartridge factory* for which an export credit was offered by Jiis **aj©sty's Government,until after the war. He did not seem at all anxious about the supply of arms* when I saw him at Riyadh. This however is probably because he believes that the war will end in a speedy victory for the Allies, and that when peace comes war material will be plentiful and cheap i and if he finds his optimism unjustified a year or so hence* he may wish to revive the question of the acquisition of war material. 5, For some time to come*it is to be hoped* there will be a British Political Officer resident at /HiyadhHiyadh, and with the frequent talks with Ibn Jaud and his advisers that he will have, no will he able to give more definite advice as to a possible subsidy, and also as to the desirability of trying to influence in our favour any of the .king’s advisers. X am extremely doubtful whether any expenditure on advisers would be justified. None of his advisers could be as pro-British as the King himself, and unless he suffers e greet falling-off in mental powers ( a con tingency mentioned in Your -ordohip’s despatch) they will not have great influence over him I hrve the nonour to be, My Lord, with the highest respect, Your -ordship’s most obedient ( huul&gt;le servantt (sd. ) R. 7.

Nos. 15 and 16 IM^DIATE, My telegram No. 12. Hafiz -Wahba- called on me this morning. He told me that he had had a long talk with Ibn Saud in Mecca and that he had been instructed to acknowledge receipt of my note and to put the King’s views and wishes before me. 2o The Italian Minister, the King had told him, had been almost threatening in his talk with -the- ; Amir Feisal. Mussolini had given his word to Hitler that he would use his best endeavours to ensure the return of Grobba. If Ibn Saud refused he was making an enemy not only of Hitler, but of Mussolini. Ibn Saud said that he could only risk incurring the hostility of Italy when convinced that His Majesty's Government would come to his aid if he were in danger, e.g. if the Italians tried to annex Asir. 3. He had had long talks with -Sir R.- ; Bullard and -Mr.- Ge Gaury and had protested his friendship and his loyalty to the British cause but he was in some doubt as to whether His Majesty’s Government has full confidence in him. He felt some tangible mark of their confidence could have/A2 . •:7 1l\&gt;. |)\lCJUK, Cty^ew«U W Imum. I - CftSoC. (^j.\rd C». h»**i Uv.cm&gt; xv\ . have been given him. I replied that I had the privilege before leaving London of being received by Your Lordship, By Sir John Shuckburgh and by Mr. Butler and that I could assure him that, one and all, they expressed •admiration'- and gratitude for the attitude His Majesty had adopted in most difficult circumstances. If His Majesty wanted tangible proofs of His Majesty's Government's confidence, I would submit for their sympathetic consideration any suggestions he could make. 4. Hafiz -Wahba* stated that what the King regarded as vital was a guarantee of assistance in the case of aggression against his territory by another Power. This ; - : he- ; - thought could conveniently take the shape merely of a note [?preliminary to arranging for the] formal instrument to be published abroad. Hafiz -'Wahba* was convinced that if the King could obtain such a promise of assistance he would refuse admittance to Grobba and risk Italian displeasure. 5. As regards immediate assistance Hafiz - : Wahba ;; said that the King wanted arms and ammunition. I said that I had understood he had decided to wait till the end of the war. The King had, Hafiz *Wahbar said, merely said so because he had gained the impression that that v/as what His Majesty's Government would wish him to say, but he did want what he had asked for in Mr. Trott's telegram Ho. 104 of August 2nd 1959 and he 'hoped'- they would be supplied, as on the occasion of Mr. Rendel's visit, at a nominal price. 6. He also wanted a credit of £250,000 gold for the -■ —— .n.*.—■ , purchase of foodstuffs in -'India-. The pilgrimage had fallen/ sa3 . fallen far below expectations and the country’s finances were a very bad way. I said I would put this proposal forwarc but that I should like to be able to give some indication of how the loan was to be guaranteed or repaid. Hafiz replied that the important thing was for us to be authorised to state that the question was having Your Lordship's sympathetic consideration - that details could be discussed later. He added very earnestly 'this is a very difficult moment for Saudi Arabia and a most favourable moment for His majesty’s Government to show their generosity' ^ 7. As regards the feasibility of giving guarantee against aggression, to the vital importance of which Hafiz -Wahba* constantly reverted, I can of course offer no opinion but I was entirely convinced that the advantage of gaining Ibn Baud’s wholehearted support far outweighed the possible loss of a proportion, or b-ven the whole of the sum he asks and the inconvenience entailed in providing him with a comparatively insignificant quantity of arms and ammunition at a nominal price. 8. Hafiz *Wahba* said that the matter was very urgent as the Italians would return to the charge as soon as the pilgrimage was over on Monday. I promised to request a very urgent reply.

Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received December 4.) (No. 160. Secret.) My Lord, Jedda, November 13, 1939. I HAVE the honour to transmit a translation of a statement about Russia and the Arab world which Ibn Saud has sent to me through Mr. Wall, who is still at Riyadh. Copies of Mr. Wall’s letter and memorandum on this subject were sent to Mr. Baggallay on the 3rd November^ 1 ) 2. It is a little difficult to see exactly what Ibn Saud is driving at. Is he asking for arms or hoping for a subsidy ? Or has he really been driven by what he thinks to be the Russian menace to contemplate an Arab union which he has hitherto regarded as chimerical owing to the different aims of the various parts ? He expressly asks His Majesty’s Government to believe that he is not grinding his own axe, but against this there is the exclamation by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, quoted by Mr. Wall: “His Majesty’s Government grant Turkey a loan of £60 million, but do not give the Arabs 60 piastres.” This recalls a remark that Ibn Saud made when he first read the scheme for the partition of Palestine, which provided for the payment of a large lump sum in order to put Transjoidan on its feet. “ By all means give Abdullah 2 million,” said the King, “ but don’t let me go bankrupt.” It may, however, be envy rather than a real need that makes the King compare the situation of Turkey with his own or with that of the Arabs in general. Captain de Gaury, who leaves for Riyadh in a few days, may be able to form a more precise notion of the King’s views. 3. Ibn Saud’s scheme for an Arab union fostered and subsidised by His Majesty s Government does not sound a very practical policy for war time, but on that His Majesty’s Government will give their reply in due course. Meanwhile, Captain de Gaury, to whom I am giving a copy of this despatch, is being instructed to put the following considerations before Ibn Saud as from me and not as representing the views of His Majesty’s Government in so important a matter :— (a) While we cannot exclude the possibility that Soviet Russia may profit by the preoccupations of the other Powers to expand southwards, it seems improbable that she will do so, for she cannot be certain of the friendship either of Germany or of Japan, and may therefore be chary of making two fresh enemies on the south—Turkey and Persia, (b) The attitude of His Majesty towards Turkey is understandable, but His Majesty’s Government have better hopes on that point. It seems certain that 1 urkey would be resolutely opposed to the advance of Russia southwards either through Turkey or through Iran. (c) The Iranian Government have always striven to avoid being brought under even the economic domination of Russia, and they would certainly resist any attempt by Russia to invade their country. (d) His Majesty’s Government are prepared to believe that the tendency will be for the Arab countries, under the influence of a common language and a common religion, to draw closer together as time goes om At the same time they have never considered that it would be wise for them to try to promote this aim, on which the Arabs themselves are by no means united at present and the French may have views of theiV own, and to embaik upon so difficult a task when enjjas'ed q maior war would be extremely difficult. ^ J (e) His Majesty has already been doing his best, as His Majesty’s Govern ment gratefully acknowledge, to remove the one grievance (the Palestine question) which prevents the Arabs from co-operating whole-heartedly with the Allies. P) Printed as Enclosures 2 and 3 to this despatch [780 d 2] B December 4, 1939. Section 2. Copy No.2 U. ^353/ /3^ (/) While subsidiary lines of defence are necessary, His Majesty s Govern ment are devoting their main energies to the principal task of defeating Germany. To this end they are concentrating on the war in the west, at sea, on the air and on land, and on strengthening Turkey and taking other measures in order to preserve peace m theA Balkans and the Mediterranean. At the same time, however, they are* doing all they can, in accordance with their obligations, to see that Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq and Egypt are in a proper state of defence against 'any possible enemy. France, too, is taking every precaution in Syria. . , , „ (q) Sir R. Bullard is very glad that the King’s statement was received before his departure for Tehran. After so many years service m Arab countries he would naturally give full weight to the point of view o the Arab world in any matter affecting the Near and Middle East, but after reading His Majesty’s statement, he will have it in mind when he reaches Tehran and is examining the problems raised by the war from a fresh standpoint. 4. This despatch had just been drafted when the Foreign Office (memorandum respecting Arab federation, dated the 28th September, was received. I trust that I am right in thinking that my remarks do not go beyond the terms of that memorandum. I have, Ac. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure 1. Translation of an undated Document. (In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate!) Declaration. (Secret.) IT has been our custom to forward to the British Government some of our views, which we think it is worth while to communicate for the information of that Government, in any circumstances which we consider important; and although there may be no practical utility in all these declarations, yet the only reason we have for forwarding them is because we know that the British Govern ment possesses, in the matters which we are discussing, information more complete than the information which we possess; and it is careful to observe its own interests as far as possible; so on that basis we now set forth that which we know in the present state of affairs. Now we hear from broadcasts, from the mouths of most of the Arabs, and from correspondence which certain advisers send to us, that everyone thinks that we should refer to the British Government that which we know, in order to ask its opinion in the light of the general interest ; and if it considers our declarations to be apposite, then we are ready to assist it in any way we can; but if it considers that the general interest is to the contrary of that, then, of course, the general interest transcends everything else There are no terrors for the British Government in the developments of the past few days, which have been full of change : the greatest and most vital of those developments have been two things : (1) The desertion of Berlin by Rome; and (2) the entry of Russia with Germany. As for the first, we had expected it, because we were' of the opinion that Italy would not enter in a war in which she stood to gain nothing; but as for the second, that was strange and we had not expected it, nor had anyone else. So we see that things are rapidly changing day by day, and that our own interests prompt us to consult with the British Government on three matters. The first is its connexion with our interests. The second is its connexion with the interests of the Arabs. And the third, and the most important, is its connexion with British interests in Arab countries and the combination of the Arabs with it, on account of their traditional friendship, derived from the past and the present, and on account of the connecting links3 which are necessary for Britain and the advantage to be gained from that. And in addition to that the good name which may result from that is the best effect on that interest, and will be a blow for the enemy. For all these reasons we set ^sforth our views as follows :— First: We do not doubt that the British Government is fully convinced that all the Arabs do not consider that the German or the Soviet Governments have any intention to make war on the Arabs; there would be no interest for them in that. Second: The whole of the Arabs, whether those who agree with the British Government or those moslems who are estranged from it, including those whose views are contrary to those of the British Government, in fact we believe every one of them, would be very sorry to see any enemy defeat the British Government, because they are convinced that their interests impel them and oblige them to combine with them and to have friendship for them; and that should any enemy prevail over the British they would suffer as much as Britain. Now if this is plain to the British Government, then in our view the Arabs, who are in great numbers, do not possess at the present moment sufficient strength to enable them to oppose any disasters, if any sudden change in the present state of affairs should j take place which might threaten the Arab world with danger. They do not possess sufficient force to combat such events, in the first place because the equipment which would enable them to do their duty is small, and, in the second place, because of the want of union among them, whether between Governments or between races; and in the third place there exists no famous man who could do what was necessary when the time came, and make the Arabs combine; for the pi esent time is not such as would call forth a common programme and a united policy. Fourthly, we see that danger threatens the Arabs and their friends. And treaties of alliance, made without a binding link between persons who will do what is their duty and will oblige the people to strengthen those treaties—without that such treaties are worth little. For instance, the Treaty of Sa’dabad—when the time came all of them followed their own interests and abandoned the , principle. In view of all this, if the British Government attaches great; importance to the Arab lands, and if it considers that a common voice and united strength for the Arabs would be to the advantage of the British, from the point of view of defence, and, on the other hand, would be threatening and iniurious to the enemy, then our opinion is, that if it (the British Government) agrees then to prolong the present state of affairs will be of no use after the entry of the Kussians and the Germans, and the developments of the war; and we fear that the Russians might make a sudden move in order to damage Britain and to strengthen Germany, and confuse the Allies and the colonies of Britain. And we fear that it (Russia) might therefore adopt a policy towards the Arab countries on one of two sides : either on the side of the Turks, or of the Iranians; and that would either be in enmity with the Turks and the Iranians, or by agreement with them, and if they do that, their fundamental object will be to damage Britain and her Allies. If the British Government shares our view, but if the matter is out of the question, then the present state of affairs cannot go on as it is; and if it considers that this critical situation overshadows the Arabs and their friend- snip, then we think that the British Government should act as in the Arabic proverb : Resolution is the father of need, the father of success : while inaction is the father of regret, the father of sorrow.” The essential thing is that the British Government should examine this matter and should seek the views of its friends, and should, indeed, act with resolution and vigour, and should prepare the^ assistance which is necessary for the events which may happen to the Arabs • and if a calamity should befall as mentioned above, then Britain and her friends would be prepared. And there is no might and no power, save in God l He it is who humbles the enemy, and we look to Him to prevent the occurrence of that which we fear; and verily a man sorrows not for his efforts to prepare to with stand events when God frees him from danger. In this matter there is great benefit: a check to the enemy and an assurance to the friend If the British Government agrees with that view, then let it consult its friends and ascertain thmr views m the matter and do what is necessary; but if this is a matter which the British Government considers to be impossible, then no impossible thing has been created in this way. And we hope that God will make it an impossible thing, and will be a sufficient guard against the wickedness of our enemies - and that He will make victory our ally and the ally of our friends. [780 d—2]4 PZ Enclosure 2. Copy of Letter addressed to Sir R. Bullard by Mr. J. W. Wall. Dear Sir Reader, Riyadh, November 3, 1939. IBN SAUD talked a good deal about Russia during your visit, and in general, I think, gave the impression that he considered Russia a false friend to Germany and no danger, directly, to the Allies. This view was also expressed, as far as I can remember, in the Ministry of Information’s telegram sent to us shortly after the Russians entered Poland. Ibn Saud has now changed his mind and has decided that the Russians are a menace to the Arab world. As far as I can gather, this change of mind is due to Russia’s determined and rapid advances in the Baltic area and to Turkey’s apparent failure (in Ibn Saud’s view) to declare herself prepared to stand in the way of any Russian aggression. 2. In any case, after some days of brooding, he has hatched the enclosed statement, containing views which he considers of great importance and which he wishes me to transmit to you for consideration by His Majesty’s Government as quickly as possible. As he offered to send my letter by special car, and as the labour of cyphering and decyphering so long a statement might well make the communication of it by telegraph less speedy than by car, I have sent the statement in original, together with my memorandum of his conversation—which, I hope, amplifies and explains certain points of the statement. 3. I have made no comment on the matter, confining myself, in a later discussion with Yusuf \asin alone, to clearing up some of the Arabic expressions i used and making sure I had got the King’s meaning. Ibn Saud wishes me to say that he is prepared to give all explanations and amplifications that His Majesty’s i Government may ask for. He hopes, too, as Yusuf Yasin repeated to me, that His Majesty’s Government will not think he is grinding his own axe and discount his estimate of the seriousness of the danger he apprehends on that account. 4. My personal impression is that he really believes in the danger he describes. He is quite sincere : the force and clarity of his expressions left me in no doubt about that. He toned down his badawy aiccent and took pains to make me understand every sentence. He used strong language about the Russians (“ dogs,” “ accursed ones,” “ this vile Government ”). 5. Though my memorandum does not lay much stress on the “material assistance which Ibn Saud would like His Majesty’s Government to give the Arabs, this is undoubtedly of great importance to their minds. Yusuf Yasin said to me last night: Tou grant Turkey a loan of £60 million (or whatever it is) in return for fair words, while we, the Arabs, who could and would do far more for you than Turkey promises, you don’t give us 60 gurush ! ” Enclosure 3. Memorandum by Mr. J. W. Wall. IN a private interview at 9 a.m. on the 3rd November (His Majesty Yusuf Yasin and J. W. Wall only present) the King~3eveioped a point of view he had outlined to me in the public interview the day before, and handed me a state- ment( 2 ) which he had dictated the night before. 2. As genei al pieface, he said that his opinions were naturally based on the information available to him. His Majesty’s Government had, of' course wider sources of information, and they would judge his opinions by the light of what they knew about the present situation and its probable developments. 3. The Arabs’ concern with European affairs arises from the fact that the necessities of modern mechanical civilisation have made the Arabs dependent on European skill and resources. 4. Of the three European Powers with interests in the Arab world Britain is recognised by all the Arabs as being the most important. French influence is ( 2 ) Enclosure 1.I (“) The King of the Yemen. r Q 0 S X s 5 e e i e s 3 t r 3 T 3 t I I [ 5 geographically more restricted and is confined to the region where France actually exercises political power; France is not thought by the Arabs to wish to extend her influence in the Near East. Moreover, French interests correspond pretty well with those of Britain. Italy—whatever Ahmed Bin Yehia’s( 3 ) flirtations with her ''Nay amount to—has no foothold in the Near Eastern Arab countries; she is ^'sartily hated by the vast majority of the Arabs, including Yehia, and would be even if nothing stood against her other than her action in Libya. But the destinies of the Arab world are inevitably linked with Britain’s, and all the Arabs prefer to be associated with Britain rather than with any other European Power. 5. 1 his being so, the Arabs could not, at the beginning of the war, regard Britain s situation with indifference. But the situation is no longer what it was on the 3rd September. Then the struggle apeared to be a straight fight between the Allies and Germany : the latter having no interests in the Arab world, and the former being, in the King’s view, assured of ultimate victory, the war was not immediately alarming to the Arab countries. The only Near Eastern State likely to take material part—however slight—in the war was Turkey, whom the Arabs thought to be on the point of concluding an alliance with the Allies. Now, how ever, two things have happened that change the situation and create a potential danger to the Arab countries : 6. Russia has taken a hand in the war, showing herself to be, if not an entirely I docile tool of the Nazi’s, then, at least, no friend of the Allies; and Turkey has j taken up an attitude that amounts to neutrality, and has especially insisted that / she will take no action directed against Russia. 7. The danger to the Arabs from this new situation lies in this : Germany will seek to damage British interests wherever she can; that she is already seeking to attack Britain in the Arab world is shown by her broadcasts to the Arabs (the King mentioned particularly that German radio had issued invitations to Arabs to go to Germany, and had recommended various “ safe ” routes through neutral countries). But the Arabs are a sceptical folk, and the Germans must be aware on what stony ground their gospel falls. Hence it follows they will attempt a more direct, material attack on Britain’s position in the Near East. Their only route to the Arab countries is through Russia. 8. At first sight Russia’s contact with the Arabs seems far from direct. But in reality only two States separate them : Turkey and Iran. The Arabs have no faith either in the strength of these two “ barriers ” or in their abiding friendship for the Arabs. Where is the Pact of Saadabad ? Turkey has already declared that she will not fight Russia. It is not impossible that differences between Iraq and Iran may occur. 9. The present war situation thus involves a threat to the security of the Arab States themselves as well as a threat to British interests in them. In defending themselves against this threat the Arabs would be defending British interests. (Here the King asked Sheikh Yusuf to read the “ statement ” to me.) 10. But, as shown in the “statement,” the Arab line of defence is at present weak for three reasons : (1) The natural poverty of the Arab countries and their lack of military equipment; (2) the internal weakness of the regimes : Egypt and Iraq, the two strongest Arab States, were to some extent disabled by party strife—especially Iraq, where the Shi’a sect is an important cause of instability; (3) the lack of union between the various States. 11. If, then, the King argued, the danger he apprehends does not seem entirely imaginary to His Majesty’s Government, it is clearly in their interests to strengthen the Arab States as much as they can. This can be done in two ways : (1) By giving material assistance; (2) by helping the various Arab States to compose their differences and thus promoting the unity of the Arab world. 12. The King laid great emphasis on the important part His Majesty’s Government could play in bringing about Arab unity. He appeared to conceive of Great Britain as the mediator and adviser of a federation of Arab States. There is no one man or one State in the Arab world strong enough and disinterested enough to command the respect of all the rest. But Great Britain has the respect of all the Arabs. True she is not, strictly speaking, “ disinterested,” but her interests are not those of dynastic and family prestige and fortune, but economic and strategic interests, the service of which need not clash with the furtherance of purely Arab interests—indeed, the service of6 Britain s interests is likely to leg-d to an increase in the material welfare of the Arabs. He believed that,.having such a position, Britain would be able to bring about a large measure of unity anjong the Arabs by “ guaranteeing the protection of the interests of each State in relation to the others.’' (When, discussing this later with Yusuf Yasin, I said I couldn’t see the precise, practical application the phrase, Yusuf Yasin said that the King was indicating a general principi*^ and it was premature to try and discuss what practical forms a policy based on such a principle would take.) j 13- The King was confident that the Arabs would gladly concede the role of “ referee to Britain, and, if Britain would accept it, he for his part would endeavour his utmost to carry out the principle and induce the other Arabs to carry it out, because he was convinced, and believed that the majority of the Arabs were convinced, that only through Britain’s aid could be achieved those ambitions which are shared by all the Arabs : Unity, security and independence. 14. In conclusion, the King repeated his conviction of the community of British and Arab interests in the Near East. He had put forward these views because he was convinced that to follow them was the best way of attaining ends which could neither be viewed nor pursued in isolation. He wished it to be understood that, in expressing the views contained in his statement, he was following his custom of using complete frankness of expression to the British Government; his language concealed no personal ambition. He said plainly: “ Consult your friends,” meaning not only the other Arabs, but the French.F-msAegv/es. Draft Mr. Dtonehewer- 3ird ? J edda. No FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. SECRET . Sir, I have now considered Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No. 160 (2764/1419/4) of the 13th November, with which he forwarded a translation of a statement by Ibn Saud about the Soviet menace, as v/ell as Mr. Wall’s letter and memorandum of the 3rd November on the same subject, and entirely approve the preliminary observations which oir Reader Bullard instructed Mr. de Gaury to make to Ibn Saud in reply. In particular, I am satiolied that nothing which Mr. de Gaury was instructed to say conflicts with any views expressed by the Foreign Office on Arab Federation. 2. The essence of the views which Ibn Saud desires to make known to His Majesty’s Government seems to be that the Arab States would/3 ./ would be able to resist a soviet threat to their independence more effectively if they were in some way associated under the aegis of His Majesty’s Government than if each were fighting on its own, and that the creation of such an association by His Majesty’s Government is urgent on account of the imminence of this threat and the apparent unwillingness of Turkey and Persia to resist it. He does not specify with much precision the kind of association which he has in mind. In fact, he is very vague. But although it may be his ambition to become the head of an Arab federation it does not seem necessary to suppose that for his present purpose he really contemplates anything more than a system of defensive alliances, in which Great Britain would participate. At any rate it may be convenient to let it seem in any eventual reply that this is what he is thought to have meant.3 Whether a system of Arab alliances on these lines is desirable or not, and whether or not it would in present circumstances provide any real additional security against attack by a powerful State, it is at any rate within the range of practical politics in a sense in which Arab federation in its more usual meaning is probably not. So far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, all that would be needed would be an alliance with Ibn oaud himself and (though this would be more difficult, while also less essential) with the King of the Yemen. It is possible, moreover, that if His Majesty's Government were to give a sufficiently strong lead the Arab States, even including the Yemen, might be willing to become the allies of each other, while the French Government might conceivably agree to be a party to the various instruments in which the alliances were embodied. In any case the idea of a solid bloc of Arab States following/following the lead of Great Britain and France is not in itself unattractive. But there are unfortunately various reasons which render it most difficult and even undesirable for His Majesty’s Government to attempt to create such a bloc at the present time. 4. .for a start, it is necessary to take account of the position of Italy. it might be possible to argue that, strictly speaking, the conclusion of treaties of defensive alliance with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen would not be contrary to the terms of the An glo-Italian Agreement of the 16th rV - April, 1938, regarding certain areas in the Middle East. But any attempt to negotiate an alliance of any kind with either State would most certainly he regarded by the Italian Government as a breach of the spirit of that Agreement. The continued neutrality of Italy is of great importance at the present time, and just as the Anglo-Italian Agreements ¥ of/of 1938 have probably played a large part in determining the attitude so far adopted by Italy in the present war, so would a breach of either the spirit or the letter of any one of those Agreements render it less certain that this attitude would continue to be observed, 5. An attempt might be made to reconcile Italy to a British or Franco-British alliance with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen on the ground that this alliance was aimed solely against the possibility of aggression by the Soviet Union. It is doubtful whether the Italian Government would find this wholly convincing. But, even if they did so, they might suggest that Italy should join the alliance. If the acquiescence of Saudi Arabia or the Yemen could be secured, this extension of the principles of the Middle Eastern Agreement would not necessarily be wholly disadvantageous. Although no extension/extension of Italian influence in Arabia could ever be welcome, the price might be worth paying for the sake of greater advantages in other directions, such as increased security against the Soviet Union. 6. But it might not be possible to stop Italian co-operation at this point. If their relations with Germany and the Soviet Union allowed it the Italian Government might demand to be allowed to participate in the full system of Middle Eastern alliances with which the proposed bloc was to be built up. This, again, if the Middle Eastern States consented (which is at least doubtful) might be a price worth paying for a substantial advantage such as Italian aid, not necessarily as a belligerent, in the prosecution of the war against Germany. But it would also create a serious complication, and possibly a serious danger, for British policy when the war was over. ?./7. The conclusion seems to be that unless the prospective advantages to be dervied from the proposed Arab bloc are really substantial, it would not be worth while pursuing the idea of such a bloc , since this could only be done by arousing Italian suspicions which, in their turn, could only be allayed by allowing Italy to play a greatly enhanced rdle in Middle Eastern affairs. But for various reasons the advantages are, for the present at any rate, extremely problematical. 8. In the first place, His Majesty’s Government and the French Government found in their negotiations with Turkey that, however desirous the Turkish Government might be to secure Turkey against attack or domination by powerful potential enemies, they were unwilling to commit themselves openly to an alliance, unless His Majesty’s Government and the French Government would bind themselves r not merely to afford assistance in a general way/way (as is usually done in treaties of alliance), but also to specify with precision the manner in which this assistance would be forthcoming (e.g. the despatch of troops or the provision of arms or money, as is usually done as the result of staff conversations). Similarly, in their recent negotiations with Afghanistan, His Majesty f s Government have found that for all their fear of the Soviet Union the Afghan Government were unwilling to commit themselves to a treaty of friendship with this country which would, it was hoped, have given them at least moral support. In the case of Turkey, Great Britain and France paid the Turkish price, high though it was* not only because Turkey is in a particularly exposed position, but also because, by reason of her geographical position and the qualities of her government and people, she must always constitute the principal obstacle to an advance by any European/European Power towards the Middle East. In the case of Afghanistan, His Majesty's _ ^ w. /c Government found the price too high, because, notwithstanding the fact that the integrity of Afghanistan has been one of the cardinal aims of British Imperial policy for over three quarters of a century, their commitments elsewhere did not permit them to accept the obligation of sending to Afghanistan the arms and forces which would be required if guarantee had to be fulfilled. Still less L- are His Majesty’s Government in a position at the present time to spare arms and forces for the Arab States, which are not directly exposed to Soviet aggression, over and above what they are already doing in this respect for reasons arising out of their relations with each of those States individually, Whatever resources of this kind they may possess are needed for their own equipment or for the equipment of States more immediately exposed/exposed. Yet without precise assurances as to the aid which they, would receive from Great Britain and France should their territory be invaded, none of the Middle Eastern States would be likely, when it came to the point, to enter the proposed bloc . 9. But even if it were possible for His Majesty*s Government, in spite of all these difficulties, to promote the formation in the Middle East of a front against further soviet penetration, the otate in greatest need of cheir support would not be any of the Arab otates, but Persia, whose isolation would in all probability render her a tempting victim should the Soviet Government ever definitely decide on a policy of Middle Eastern adventure. 10. His Majesty's Government are not, however, in a position to defend at any rate the northern parts of Persia against Soviet aggression or domination while the present war with Germany continues, nor could they undertake/*undertake the task of ousting a violently pro-ooviet Persian Government. The most they might be able to do (and they would no doubt have to do it, if their prestige in Asia were to be retained) would be to counter any serious Soviet activity by a precautionary occupation of the roads leading from the Iranian plateau to Iraq and the Persian oil-fields, and by such public explanations as the circumstances of the time might require of the action, if any, which they proposed to take, when their hands were free elsewhere, to restore the status quo throughout Persia as a whole. But in the case of Persia, once again, it is difficult to suppose that an attempt to conclude an alliance 'with that country, even assuming that the ohah were to be convinced that j such an alliance would serve his interests better than perseverance in the path of strict 1 neutrality/— ■ — ——— —neutrality, could be brought to a successful issue in the absence of precise indications of what support the ohah would receive in the form of British or French arms and forces in the event of soviet aggression. 11, It must he clearly understood that the objections to Ibn Baud’s proposals set forth in the preceding paragraphs aro based on world conditions as they are today and that nobody can foresee what new policies or what sacrifices of what might otherwise be thought essential interests it may be necessary to accept under the stress of war, I have stated the objections at some length because these proposals raise issues of fundamental importance and it is desirable that you should understand the background against which the decisions of His Majesty’s Government in regard to them have/13 ./ (^) have been taken. But although I have no objection to your giving Ibn oaud at least a hint of this background in private and confidential conversation between him and yourself, your official reply, whether written or otherwise, should, if you see no objection, be on the more general lines set forth in the following paragraphs. 13, After stating that I have been informed of the personal observations conveyed to Ibn 3aud by Sir Reader Bullard, and entirely approve those observations, you should inform Ibn Baud that His Majesty’s Government have considered his important memorandum with care and sympathy. fhey are most grateful for this frank statement of his views respecting the effect of the present situation on the Arab world, and they deeply appreciate his friendly sentiments and his conviction that the Allies are defending in the war the interests of the Arabs as well as their own.13* Ibn ciaud may rest assured that His Majesty’s Government attach great importance in their own interests not only to the friendship, but also to the security of all the Arab lands, and they are anxious at all times to do what is possible to retain their friendship and preserve their security. They and the French Government are alive to the dangers which threaten these lands and to the responsibilities and obligations which fall upon them under their existing mandatory and treaty engagements. These responsibilities and obligations they have no intention of avoiding. 14. His Majesty’s Government would, however, observe that they do not share Ibn Sand’s fears that rurkey and Persia might be parties to any soviet expansion southwards. Moreover, it is apparent, especially since the Finnish campaign, that the Soviet Union is not in a position to engage in any prolonged/16 ./ far prolonged adventure outside its own frontiers, though His Majesty’s Government realise that the possibility of further Soviet aggression cannot be dismissed on this account. 15 0 As regards Turkey, she has already resisted boviet pressure to disregard her obligations to the Allies. In this connexion, Ibn baud may have been misled by some of the reservations made by Turkey, when concluding the alliance with Great Britain and France, to the effect that her obligations under the alliance did not extend 'co action which might bring her into conflict with the boviet Union, This did not mean that Turkey ever intended t 0 refrain from defending her territory and her interests if they were attacked. On the contrary, Kis Majesty’s Government are convinced that she would resist any attack with resolution.16. The position of Persia is indeed somewhat different, but His Majesty’s Government do not think that the Persian Government, any more than the Turkish Government, would willingly submit to boviet domination. If she did so, a new position would arise and His Majesty’s Government and the French Government would have to consider what steps they should take to protect their own interests and those of their Arab friends. 17. His Majesty’s Government hope, however, that this situation will not arise. Furthermore, their material resources, though great, are not unlimited and they feel sure that Ibn ^aud will realise that so far as material matters are concerned, their policy must be, not to devote their energies and resources to areas where no immediate danger is foreseen, out to concentrate them on meeting the German attack by land, sea and air and/and on strengthening those countries which are in the most exposed positions. This affords a far surer defence for all the Arab lands than the dissipation of British and French resources in the partial arming of a number of different States which are not immediately threatened by an extension of the war, especially as the soviet Union is only dangerous, or potentially dangerous, while it is in close relations with an undefeated Germany. 18, Ibn oaud has suggested that, as the most effective means of preparing the Arab States against the possibility of a Soviet attack there should be some kind of union between them, with a common programme and a common policy. His Majesty's Government certainly agree that the ^rab states, if willingly associated for purposes of defence, would be better able to resist aggression/aggression than if divided. It has always been the aim of Kis Majesty’s Government, so far as it lies in their power, to promote friendly relations between the Arab States and to assist them to settle any difrerences that may arise between them. This will continue to be their policy. At the present moment, the ;.rabs are in fact united in a common detestation of the actions of Germany and the Soviet Union, but Ibn oaud must, like His Majesty’s Government, be well aware of the many difficulties in the way of a closer degree of union. His Majesty's Government very much doubt v/hether these difficulties are likely to be surmounted, anyway unless (which they trust will not be the case) one of the Arab States were actually to be the victim of aggression. 19. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are not able to give a more positive reply to Ibn baud's suggestions. They will, however/however, hear his advice constantly in mind, and they will not hesitate to adopt it if changing circumstances should make it appear that some of his suggestions could be adopted with good prospects of success. 20. I have left to the end the possibility that Ibn Saud may have been hinting at his desire for a personal subsidy, I can well believe that any ruler in Ibn Saud’s position must find it difficult to understand how His Majesty's Government can supply arms and credits to Turkey to the tune of tens of millions of pounds, while the credits offered to himself, who has been so loyal a friend, have never been more than £80,000, and have even then proved of no practical value because His Majesty's Government cannot spare him small arms and ammunition to even half that amount. I hope thst the true explanation will be apparent from the earlier paragraphs of this despatch, but/——my but the truth would doubtless seem most unsympathetic to Ibn Saud himself, and I realise that it may be necessary sooner or later to consider an offer of material assistance in some other form, such as a subsidy, by way of recompense. The principle of a subsidy has, as you know, been X I /n tyw, , - n bi f* ^ &gt; accepted by His Majesty's Government, although any suggestions for the payment of a definite sum at a definite time would need a further decision. This question will be considered on the receipt of any further reports you may submit on Ibn Saud’s need for financial assistance^ 21 0 Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Angora, Bagdad, Cairo, Paris and Home.

Subject.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). . CONFIDENTIAL — December 22. 1939. Section 2. [E 8086/2/&gt;3/25] Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received December 22.) (No. 170.) My Lord, Jedda, December 2, 1939. IN any country where the power is concentrated in the hands of a personal ruler the extent to which his word can be relied upon is a matter of supreme importance to the foreign representative who is called upon to deal with him. We have assurances from Ibn Saud which, taken at their face value, lead us to believe that we can count upon his benevolent neutrality in this war—unless, as I have frequently said, the Allies should be defeated, when at the last moment he might well try to absorb some of the smaller Arab States on the Persian Gulf in order to forestall a similar advance from Iraq or Iran. On the other hand, when the war began the Amir Abdullah seems to have believed that Ibn Saud was threatening his territory, and although the Amir subsequently stated that he was satisfied on this head, it is always possible that the recent movement of Saudi forces to the north may revive his suspicions. It seems probable that the movement is towards the Iraq frontier, however, and some local wiseacres forecast an attempt to seize Koweit while His Majesty’s Government are busy elsewhere. The fact that an emissary of Ibn Saud’s visited Herr Hitler just before war broke out was bound to give rise to speculation. The Germans gave the visit a political tinge in their news, and Ibn Saud was not in a position to divulge to the world the information he gave to His Majesty’s Government about the object of the visit. Hence a belief in some circles in/Jedda (the Turkish Legation, for instance, who have little direct contact with Ibn Saud) that the Saudi Government are pro-German. 2. My own belief is that, if we take Ibn Saud's assurances at their face value, we shall not be far out. The behaviour of Iraq in the matter of Koweit | early this year, the assumption of a sort of moral protectorate over the smaller Arab States in the Gulf by certain political and journalistic circles in Iraq, and j the conduct of Nuri Pasha as seen through the eyes of Ibn Saud. are sufficient to account for the despatch of Saudi forces towards the Iraq border, even if the 1 King had not had trouble there from tribes which, he believes, try to play off the j two Governments against each other. I do not believe that he would welcome a German victory, even if Germany had not allied herself with Russia. The attitude which he has held towards His Majesty’s Government during the three years I have been here seems to me consistent with his wider interests. His attitude was well described to my French colleague recently by Fuad Hamza, who said that the King would never quarrel with His Majesty’s Government about the Mufti, for instance, for while it was a Moslem and Arab interest for him to support the Palestinian claim, he considered that the wider interests of the Arab and Moslem world compelled him to remain close friends with His Majesty’s Government. 3. Ibn Saud has never pretended that his attitude towards His Majesty’s Government is due to mere affection. He claims, for instance, to have told the Hadhramis, who came fishing for sympathy, that if the British were not in the Hadhramaut some other Power would be, and that they might think themselves fortunate to have secured the best of the Powers. He has often said that, as an Arab, he sympathises with any movement for Arab independence, but next to independence he considers British rule or protection to be the least galling arrangement. When justifying his support for Great Britain in the East, he points to the independence of Iraq and Egypt and the constitutional development in India, saying that, while His Majesty’s Government have doubtless acted in accordance with their conception of their own interests, no other European Power would have shown such consideration to the peoples concerned. Finally, he always [780 y 2]2 asserts that his friendship with His Majesty’s Government is based on his convic tion that his own country stands or falls with Great Britain. It would be possible, of course, for a statesman, and not merely an oriental statesman, to create and maintain this attitude as a facade, and behind it to be working for our undoing, but I think that the King’s actions for the last few years are sufficient to dispose ot this hypothesis. There was reason to believe that when the Palestine revolt^* was at its worst he was persuaded into agreeing to let the malcontents have some rifles and ammunition, but when one realises what pressure must have been put upon him, by the Arabs and by his own religious convictions, one hesitates to judge this harshly, especially when one remembers the efforts he had made to keep the peace while the question was being studied, and the advice he had frequently given to His Majesty’s Government to move in a direction in which, with the issue of the White Paper of 1939, they have now moved. The perfect friend would, of course, have refused all help to the Palestinians and, if necessary, risked his own position, but I consider Ibn Sand comparatively, as he considers His Majesty’s Government, and I find him, as he finds us, able to stand comparison. In particular, after reading some ten years of the Persia print as a preparation for a new post, my opinion of Ibn Saud’s qualities has gone up rather than down. 4. Ibn Saud has certain grave faults. His attitude towards slavery, and especially towards women slaves, is difficult to excuse; his treatment of his huge family of sons is unwise and must lead to embarrassment, if not in his own time, in the reign of his successor; and his indifference to the financial side of administration is a serious defect in a ruler. But, on the whole, he has shown himself a great ruler. No man who had not had a firm hold over himself, as well as over his people, could have steered the course in regard to Palestine which he has steered for the last two or three years. It is not that he is cynical: the depths of his personal feelings could not be doubted by anyone who had heard him repeat some of the Quranic texts about the Jews, or seen him trying to suppress his tears at the wireless announcement of the hanging of an Arab for participation in the armed movement in Palestine; but he is not led away by his feelings, but keeps his eyes fixed steadfastly on the main lines of the policy which he has adopted. I do not think that the possession of a certain greatness of mind can be denied him. 5. I am aware that there are English men and women who “ adopt ” some foreign country whose real or alleged virtues they never cease to praise, and whose interests they support exclusively, and that I risk being classed in this respect with the Aubrey Herberts, the Miss Durhams, and the Gertrude Bells. But no Englishman who has lived within 45 miles of Mecca for five years could have any illusions about the “noble Arab,” though, perhaps, the exploiters of the pilgrimage have keen competitors in baseness in those Iraqi politicians, who, it appears, sponsor the view in the local school-books that the independence of Iraq was won, not from the Turks by the Allies, but from the British by the Arabs. No, my good opinion of Ibn Saud is not part of an illusion about the Arabs, but is based on my experience of his actions for three years and of some other countries for various periods. For instance, all orientals are supposed to be highly suspicious, but I have found Ibn Saud less suspicious than the French in Morocco; again, the Soviet officials with whom I had to deal for nearly four years serve to elevate the character of Ibn Saud by contrast to a high level of probity and good faith. 6. The personal relations between Ibn Saud and the British officials with whom he has been brought into contact over a period of nearly thirty years have been almost uniformly good, and I should be glad to know that my official relations would always be as easy in future as they have been here. I feel a real regret that I have probably had my last talk with ibn Saud, and shall never again listen to one of his long monologues, rambling and repetitive but by no means pointless, and none the less sound on European politics because all foreign names but the most simple are beyond his capacity, so that even the ^familiar “ Inghilterra’’ becomes “ qandara,’’ which in the mouth of any other Arab means “ bridge ’’; “ Czecho-Slovakia ’’ is a despairing wave of the hand; and a certain Miss O’Looney, who flits in and out of the talk like some engaging’friend of Mr. Flurry Knox’s, turns out to be an eminent Italian statesman.' 7. Ibn Saud being a firm and capable ruler and. as I think, a loyal friend to His Majesty’s Government, it is naturally a matter of great importance how3 long his effective rule will last until cut short by death or by incapacity. I can ij only say that in October this year he seemed less heavy in his movements than a year ago, and that in spite of Mr. Philby’s gloomy prognostications I see no sign |/ of mental break-up in him. _ 8.

FE 7409/177/25] [ '953 J Copy No. 113 Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received November 9.) (No. 150.) My Lord, Jedda, October 24. 1939. DURING my recent visit to Riyadh I sent brief telegrams on the various matters discussed, and on my return to Jedda I have the honour to submit some general remarks, in the light of my visit, on the relations at this critical moment between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. 2. I found the King not at all inclined to sit on the fence, waiting to see how the war in Europe would go, but outspoken in his sympathy for the Allies and anxious to do all he could to ensure that there should be nothing to prevent the Arabs of the territories with which Great Britain and France have special relations from co-operating with them. One of the first remarks of the Amir Saud (in the presence of an American doctor, too) was : “ We are on the side of the Allies/’ and he said something of the same kind when 1 called on him to say good-bye; but his father was just as outspoken. Nor has Ibn Saud been content with assurances to us. Apart from his general support in the Palestine question and his remarkable frankness in communicating to us over the last two years some at least of the particulars of negotiations with Iraq, Italy, Japan and i Germany, we have recent evidence of his decision not to proceed, while the war j lasts, with the negotiations for the supply of arms and ammunition from ! Germany, and of his consent to receive a representative of His Majesty’s Govern ment to reside at Riyadh for a considerable time. 3. Ibn Baud’s desire that His Majesty’s Government should be on the winning side in the present war agrees with the tenor of his previous words and acts, but is none the less satisfactory, in view of the relative insignificance of the material help we have been able to give him in contrast to the greater generosity (as it might seem) of the Italians and, more recently, the Germans, in letting him have, in part at low prices and in part as a gift, arms and ammunition which he badly needs and which we are unable to furnish on any terms. Ibn Baud estimates Danaan gifts at their true value, and accepts them without illusions. On the other hand, we know, from copies of correspondence which he has shown us, that he has not secured the German arms by protestations of exclusive friendship. He seems to have told the Germans flatly that his interests were too closely connected with those of His Majesty’s Government for him to adopt a policy hostile to their interests, and in the end to have forced the Germans to accept the position and to sign the agreement for the supply of arms without insisting on the condition that Ibn Baud should agree to observe neutrality in case of any dispute which might arise between Germany and Great Britain. Bo eager were the Germans to conciliate Ibn Saud that, after the outbreak ol war, Herr Woermann gave Khalid-al-Qarqani, the King’s envoy, an official letter offering to supply the arms now, to be exported to Jedda on a Netherlands steamer at Saudi risk, or to hold them, in the safe-keeping of the German Government, at the disposal of His Majesty. The King decided, however, not to proceed with the transaction during the war. He was grateful to His Majesty’s Government for the suggestions as to the best means to overcome the difficulties of finance, but he felt that the political objections were insuperable. He feared that, if the arms were shipped to him, the fact would be used as a basis for exaggerated claims by the Germans, whose wireless propaganda about Khalid’s visit to Berlin will be' remembered, and that his action might be misinterpreted in Arab countries and elsewhere. This decision is satisfactory to His Majesty s Go\em inent, who do not wish to see even £120,000 in gold or free exchange pass into German hands. With characteristic frankness, Ibn Saud did not claim that political considerations alone underlay his decision; on the contrary, he said with a grin that after the war German arms might be going for nothing. Nevertheless, [755 i—2]2 I am sure that he did not wish to give the German cause even the small hllip that the confirmation of the order might have given it. 4. It might be expected that Ibn Saud, as a dictator himsell, would sympathise with the totalitarian States, but that is not so. Ibn Saud does not regard himself as a dictator of the Hitler order, but as a monarch limited by th e y* precepts of the Quran. On one occasion he accepted as correct a suggestion made that he ruled under a “religious constitution. To him there is » 1 fundamental difference between the theocracy of Saudi Arabia and the depotism, tempered neither by the fear of God nor readiness to listen to human advice, or a man like Hitler. But he frankly says that Hitler is mad, and quotes an Arabic proverb which affords a close parallel to “ Quern deus vult perdere. ^ hrad proof of Hitler’s madness Ibn Saud cites the pact with Soviet Russia, which he believes will be one of the causes of Germany s downfall. His own hostility to Soviet Russia is intense. Self-interest, injured by the cessation of the stream of pilgrims from Moslem communities now under Soviet rule, may have something to do with this, but Ibn Saud also dislikes a rule which can find no room for i the religion and the social system of Islam. The prolonged negotiations between Soviet Russia and Turkey gave him acute anxiety. His suspicions of Turkey, as nursing an undying grudge against the Arabs, are well known to His Majesty s Government, and it was not surprising that he should imagine Soviet Russia as offering Turkey a free hand to the south in return for a free hand for Russia in the Balkans. The news of the signature of the pact between Great Britain, France and Turkey, which arrived just before I left Riyadh, did something to reassure His Majestv. 5. Having taken up an attitude of neutrality so benevolent towards the Allies it is natural that Ibn Saud should desire that Palestine should cease to be a cause of irritation to the Arab world. Although he ridicules German propaganda as overdone, he fears lest the Arabic broadcasts from Berlin, conducted with vitriolic skill and force by such people as Yunus Bahri, may have some effect on Arab minds, and he considers that the restoration of peace in Palestine and some form of open support by the Palestinian Arabs for the Allied cause would be the greatest blow to Germany. I found him still in the stage of the armistice-amnesty idea. One can understand that, having no obligations of alliance towards His Majesty’s Government such as those of Iraq and Egypt, he should be unwilling to make yet another appeal to the Palestinian Arabs unless he has something to offer. Nevertheless, he accepted the statement which I gave him, based on Foreign Office telegram No. 133 of the 2nd October, explaining the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Mufti and towards a possible appeal by the Arab States to the people of Palestine. He conveyed this statement to Jamal-al-Husaini, who was then in Riyadh, and telegraphed it to his representative in Bagdad, with the suggestion that Iraq should approach Egypt and he himself the Imam of the Yemen, with a view to concerted action to bring about peace in Palestine. 1 6. We need have no fear that Saudi Arabia may become a centre for anti- British intrigue during the war. Anti-British broadcasts will be listened to. but only in private houses; wireless broadcasts in coffee-shops are not permitted, and a Royal decree forbids the populace to discuss the international situation, with which, it says, they have no concern. The ground for the decree is stated therein to be the inherent unsuitability of the Holy Land of Islam for propaganda. This decree suits His Majesty’s Government very well, since we cannot compete with our enemies in vituperation. Dr. Grobba, who, on having to leave Iraq, wanted to make for Riyadh by land, was deflected from his purpose by an ingenious excuse, and Ibn Saud told me with great vehemence that he knew Dr. Grobba only wanted to engage in propaganda, and that he was resolved not to have him in Riyadh at any cost. We know that Ibn Saud also refused to allow Dr. Ruwaiha, the doctor to the German Legation in Bagdad, to come to Saudi Arabia. He showed me a number of papers about Mizhir-al-Shawi, whose journey from Iraq to Saudi Arabia had excited suspicion; they tended to show that the main, if not the only, reason for the journey was to escape vengeance or punishment for a tribal murder, and proved in any case that Ibn Saud was keeping a close watch on the man. He declared with great vehemence that he was entirely opposed to having to receive the Mufti in his | territory a man whom he despises as a shifty self-seeker. Jamal-al-Husaini, who had gone to Riyadh from Bagdad to see him, was received in audience onlyonce (so the King said), and then only to be told the latest decision of His Majesty’s Government about the Mufti and the Palestine situation, and to be dismissed back to Bagdad; and when, just after Jamal’s departure, Ibn Sand learned through me that Jamal was considered by the High Commissioner of Palestine to have invented and spread abroad unfounded tales of ill-treatment of returning Palestinian refugees by the Palestine authorities, he telegraphed to his representative in Bagdad in very strong terms, to urge Jamal and the Mufti not to engage in any propaganda or other activities against Great Britain, as that would be ruinous to the Arab world. 7. It was after this that Ibn Saud went over with me the history of his efforts in connexion with Palestine during the last year. He claimed that if. some little while after the issue of the white paper, hostilities in Palestine died down, it was partly owing to his efforts, and he instructed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to show me the correspondence. Sheikh Yusuf produced a sheaf of corres pondence, direct and indirect, between the King and the Syrian and Palestinian leaders. It began with a letter to the Saudi Consul in Damascus, through whom, together with Bashif-al-Sadawi, Ibn Saud was in touch with the leaders. This letter was rather on the lines of the letter from Ibn Saud to Nuri Pasha, which the latter showed, perhaps in a mutilated form, to many Arabs, in an effort, it would seem, to discredit Ibn Saud as anti-Arab. It advised the Arab leaders to become reconciled to Great Britain and France, lest the British and French Governments should grow tired of unceasing opposition and join with the Turks and the Jews against the Arabs; and suggested that if only the question of Palestine could be settled, a solution of the Syrian problem would follow. I was shown individual replies from Jamil Mardom and Shukri Quwatli and a joint letter signed by them and five others. Shukri served as go-between with the Mufti. It is not necessary to take at their face value the protestations in these letters, promising to be guided by the King’s advice, but the correspondence did show what efforts the King was making in the interests of peace in Palestine— not, he was as anxious as ever to explain, to give pleasure to His Majesty’s Government, but because he felt it essential in the interests of all Arabs. His interest in Syria was doubtless prompted in part by his desire to obtain French support for the Amir Faisal as a candidate for the Syrian Throne. 8. Ibn Saud showed no sigji of wanting anything from His Majesty’s Government in these days. He is not of the blackmailing type, and he would probably admit that the defeat of Germany, whom he regards as a danger to Islam and to the East in general, will be a reward in itself for his benevolent neutrality. He seemed grateful for such action as we have been able to take to temper the wind of war to his country. His immediate preoccupation in these days is the pilgrimage, which, as a result of war conditions, is likely to be a small one and so to affect his budget and to arouse discontent in the Hejaz. I was able to give him some consolation by reporting that the resumption of sailings of Indian pilgrim ships was being actively considered, and by reminding him of the very helpful attitude of the Government of India on the matter of the export of food-stuffs to Saudi Arabia. I also told him that we were appealing to Egypt to allow the export of certain machinery parts required by the gold mine at Mahd. and to Transjordan in connexion 'with his desire to import food-stuffs from there in spite of the general prohibition of export. But what Ibn Saud valued most was the statement in which His Majesty’s Government say that they know of no ground on which the Amir Abdullah could possibly suppose that he is likely to be chosen for the Throne of Syria by the French. His cheerfulness after this statement lends support to his contention that he doesn't want Syria himself, but doesn't want to see a Hashimite there. 9. The proposal that Captain de Gaury, until recently political agent at Koweit, should go to Riyadh as a representative of His Majesty’s Legation, threw Ibn Saud into a panic when first broached some weeks ago, but was eventually accepted with manifest pleasure. Having got used, during my visit, to having someone at hand to talk to, the King did not like the idea of my , leaving, but he was easily persuaded to accept Captain de Gaury as a substitute. / To fill an interval of several weeks I left behind Mr. Wall, who knows Arabic exceedingly well, to serve as liaison officer, and Ibn Saud seemed much pleased with this arrangement. He waved aside the suggestion that other Powers might</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002be_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2163</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002be</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2163</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/91 'Saudi Arabia.
