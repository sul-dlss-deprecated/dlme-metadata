And therefore, there are no grounds for private individuals to put a claim for same against the Viceroy of India as a representative of the said Co. ' The circumstances of the action for which this judgment was given may he summed up in the t o - i-ov. ing * - The Eastern Indian Co. had annexed lands belonging to a certain Indian Rajah, who was still under age, and had lixed lor him a regular allowance for life. The Co. designated itself as a tutor of the Rajah, just for a short period, and then finally took possession of his private properties. Then he died, his heirs brought an action against the Viceroy who was considered as having replaced the Eastern Indian Co. and claimed the arrears of the allowance and asked for a statement of account of the management of the Rajah's private properties. The Court decided that the action taken by the Co. comes under the 'Acts of State' and is not within the powers of the Courts. In a Court presided by Judge Fletcher Molton in the action of Salamon V, the Indian Secretary of State of India, the Court Adjudged thats- 'Acts of state are not all of one kind; their nature and consequences may differ in an infinite variety of ways and these differences may profoundly affect the position of municipal Courtswith regard to them 0 For instance, an Act of State may fix the relations between two States each of which continues to possess an independant existence« The consequences of such an Act of ®tate are entirely beyond the congnisance of municipal Courts because they do not administer treaty obligations between independent States« now These principles/quoted^ should be respected in the Courts of a Government responsible for these Acts of State as ouch as they should be followed in the case v&amp;ere the PAct of State' was issued by an independent State other than the one to which the court belongs* The English Courts have strictly followed this in many similar cases* In a case in which the English Courts decided that it had no jurisdiction to adjudge an action raised by British Subjects against the seizure of their properties in Iceland affected by certain Danish subjects, which seizure was later confirmed by the Danish Government} the Court decided that it had no power to deal in the action, although it was raised by Britishers against Danish subjects, on the grounds that the decision of the Danish Goverruient in confirming the seizure was one of the 'Acts of State'* (See .the aforesaid volume, page 12 Chapters 9 &amp; 65)o There is no doubt that a Protectorate Treaty is one of these 'Acts of State', whether it be considered in regard to Great Britain or in regard to HoH. the Prince of Kweit* On the other hand, there is no doubt that the guarantee given by the British Government to the Prince in consequence of his appreciable assistance during the War, is admittedly an 'Act of State' and its said character cannot be contested or affected by having been drawn up in the form of an agreemento (See judgment delivered by Judge Fletcher Molton in the case previously mentioned of Salamon V the Secretary of State oi India)o Had the British Government put in force this guarantee, the Acting Commander-in-Chief would have ordered the registration of the properties in the name of HoH. the Prince* Such action on his part would be taken as an 'Act of State' o Therefore, the Courts have not the power to adjudge upon its correctness or not, orwhether it is in conformity with the lav/s or otherwise, because Acts of State cannot be weighed except by the State necessities and big aims which backed them up« The Courts should, therefore, gteis judge Fletcher Molton decided, respect such Acts and them as established facts which eannot be overlookedo EXTRACT FliOU THE ENGLISH &amp; EMPIRE DIGEST o (VoI&gt; 38 * pages 4 &amp; 5)» But the object and effect of an Act of State are not necessarily of this kind. Its intention said e ffect may be__tQ modify and create r^fhta as be tween the Government &amp; IndivldUftli who fcr_e__or vho_i»re about to become subjects of _the_Govt • &lt;» The true view of an Act of State appears to me to be that it is a catastrophic change constituting a new departure. Municipal Law has nothing to do with the Act of Change by which this departure is affectedo Its duty is simply to accept the new departure; and its power and its duty to adjudicate upon an enforce, rights of individuals or of the Govt* in the future appear to me to be precisely the same whether the origin of such rights be an Act of State or not &gt; But although this be so it must not be supposed that the principles of interpretation applicable to an Act of State are the same as those which apply to other Acts.

As regards the plaintiff pretentions that the Acting Cociaander-in-Chief had no authority to order the registration of the deeds of property in the name ot K.H* the Frince, these pretentions are urffounded &amp; incorrect as this Officer uas commandin the troops occupying this territory (Basra) &lt;&gt; This power was given to him by the Protectorate Treaty in question, which was drawn upbetween his Government and HoR« The l^ince of Kweit. The Officer comir.ajnding had to satisfy H.Eo at the time and prove to him that the British Government was interested in his affairs ? and well disposed to put in force its obligations • The registration of the deeds in question and the Protectorate Treaty, although two individual parts, aim at one and the same object and lead to the completion of one by the other, and therefore it is ,unfounded and unreasonable to say that the Acting Commander- in-Chief was not authorized by his Government to order the registra- -tion. Ivbreovar, it must be admitted that when a Government confirms its representative in a post of importance - even with limited powers - any action he may take must be regarded as an ,, Act of State” Therefore, the decisions taken by the British Government should be considered as final decisions* 3o From the foregoing, it is sufficiently proved that the Acting Commandsr-in-Chief had the right in regard to the registration of the deeds of property of HoHq The Prince, considering, that this action comes under his power in his capacity as Acting Commander- in-Chiaf and is considered an “Act of State' emanating at that time from an authorised channel* and must be respected a just decision, the discussion of which cannot be admitted or held as valid* 4* In view of the aforementioned statements, it is important to expose what is really meant by a guarantee or security* The Act of Security is a declaration from the guarantor to the guaranteed to take on himself obligations to secure &amp; maintain the rights of the guaranteed or otherwise defray their value* A security therefore combines two steps*, the first is that the guarantor is held to stand by the guaranteed and defend him until he obtains his very rights, and if he fails, he has to give him the value of the security, which is the second step* Disputes arising as a result of ^uarc.nteed rights would unfailingly lead the guarantor into such disputes and their In the case in point, HoHo Prince Moubarak encountered some( 8 ) difficulties in regard, to the registration of his deeds during the Turkis rule and. later Great Britain guaranteed him his rights for the possession of these same properties. H.H. had no doubt whatever as to the importance of this in relation to the said properties and that it would be fUlly securedo So long as the guarantee given by the British Government concerns properties under dispute, the plaintiffs who brought this action against the Prince should certainly have brought it in the first place against the British Government, the Prince’s guarantor, and such guarantee, as already explained, is an 'Act of State 1 * which does not concern any Court either in the Iraq or elsewhere. In spite of this, the question may be considered from another point of view. Ihe British Government took this step at the time of the occupation of Iraq vhich was administered in accordance with statute of such occupation. Bater on, and following Peace Treaties, the country became under mandate* hen this mandate ceased to exist in accordance with treaties of friendship between Great Britain &amp; Iraq, the latter obtained its independence. Should not the Government of Iraq by these treaties and after having replaced the-British Government and became independent, take over on its own responsibility all the engagements and obligations of Great Britain in so far as concerns lands in Iraq? We cannot admit or imagine that Great Britain had intended to free the Iraq Government from the obligations she took upon herself towards H.H. The Prince, especially when this guarantee cannot be complete or achieve its ends to the benefit of the Prince unless the Government of Iraq is bound by its terms, having replaced the British Government in its obligations towards the Prince. These points have been given in order to enlighten the Court in regard to the numerous international difficulties, resulting from the present dispute which can never be solved by ordinary Courts•( 9 &gt; r Q) h&lt;x&gt; PSFSNCE ON 'I'hS QUESTION OF THE GREAT LAPSE OF TIt,iE - The prosecutor replied oji this defence thu ^ the &gt; rince adeiitted thie action and t^at their testatrix v^as absent, and also that this defence could not be heard against a (Khokani; legal Acu* Our answer to this is bri^fo The case is tuai the plai ; iti.? j.b pretend ownership of these properties - the subject of this dispute* H.H&lt; The Prince strongly d^ied this and submitted official documents to prove his own ovmersiiip of these properties in support of his defence an o ••-... 1 It is strange how it has been understood that HoH« The Prince's admittance is taken by them as a confession their rights in the litigation under dispute..

The Prince was in full possession of these . ropertie3 and of the proper documents which confirmed from • that these documents or others were not necessary in support or this. It is sufficient that 15 years elapsed during which period the plaintiffs made no opposition, and these are sufficient grounds for the judge to reject the ease* As regards the plaintiffs' statement concerning the absence of their testatrix.; this should not be taken in o account, • ec the absence which prevents the unhearing of a case is one of a definite nature when the whereabouts of the absentee are unknown and then it is not known v/het ier he is dead or ilive© absence is legally confirmed by a judgment, his will is then openedo. But as a matter of fact, the whereaGOUts o the p.. :.%i r testatrix v/ere known and she had an authorised representative horu&amp;naged her estate, and nobody whatever had given notice that she was untraceable or applied to register her absence legally. Her ill was not opened until her death in the year 1930 5 as proved in the official distribution of her estate. It is a legally established point that our defence regarding the relapse of time cannot be considered void unless the definite absence is proved, and this was not the fact; and further it cannot be considered void unless the testatrix would be under age, which point was not mentioned by the plaintiffs. As for their pretention that the relapse of time cannot be applied to Khakani deeds, no reference to this could be found in the Iraq Laws. As regards the judgments to which the plaintiffs referred, if correct, would have been given in c*.ses different to .is action. Cur objection to the hearing of this action is on legal grounds, with the express aim to prevent the impression of forgery or false accusations against him who has been in possession of the properties for a considerable time and this is clear proof that they belong to him. The unhearing of a case, owing to lapse of time, was originally decreed to prevent attempts of forgery of false reclama- -tions against him .who has been in possession of the property for a considerable time, which presumes that it belongs to himo Such grounds although correct in most cases may be not in some rare ones. The legislator gives no heed to what is rare, and so he presumes, de pure, that the said lapse of time proves that the claimant has no right on the property. Therefore, there is no reason or place for arguments against our defence on the great lapse of time, aid submit that the plaintiffs who remained silent, negligent and careless with regard to their interests •=» after having been deprived of the possession of the properties - now come forward and declare that they have a document to support their claim, trying to evade the presumption which is in the basis of the law relating to the lapse of time. Argument3cannot be admitted because the aim of the lav the lapse of time, as already stated, is not combined and thelegislator ^ast*satisfled on the points of the silence during that period as also ou the question cf the possession of the propertieso A WORD IN CONCLUSION OF THE CASS* all what has been explained and in spite of the incompetence of the Court and the case being prescribed* it- should, be rejected on the grounds that HoKo The Prince holds authentic deeds in complete form • deeds emanating from an authorised person holdtn^ a procuration thoroughly proved to be given by the proprietor• In accordance with the rules and laws^ all measures in general with regard to sales* donations^ properties in trust* marriage and diverse* sanctioned by a procuration would have the power of right as if given by proper person concerned* El Kirtas Pasha within the powers of a procuration he had in hand* sold to H*Ho Prince Mobarak El Sabah these properties^ the object of this action and by this sale they .no longer exist in the name of the original proprietor since the date of its sale which was registered in 1915. Since it is admitted that this sale has separated these properties from the properties of the testatrix, there is no reason whatever to listen to the plaintiffs* pretentions which should be rejected* It does not assist them in this action if they declared that the sale was in favour of one person and not in that of another of the sons of El Sheikh Mobarak El Sabbah, as the property has in any case come out of the ownership of the textatrix and her possessions, and consequently they have no further claim or right thereon whatever, THEREFORE We insist on the demands laid down in our first memorandum*4 ^ p. z. ^ •*'7 - 0.d / • 3 ^-&gt; j NO DISTRIBUTION.

My dear Baggallay, I had a talk with Tewfik Doss Pasha at a party the other night at which he got on to the cases against the Sheikh of Koweit in the Iraqi Courts. The Pasha, who was profuse in expressions of regret at his 'inability” to go personally to Koweit, said that he had been into the matter fully with his substitute, Rushdy Bey, on the latter’s return from Koweit. He thought Rushdy Bey had performed an excellent piece of work, and that his 'conclusions*' as to the legal situation were admirably drawn up and should suffice in an unbiassed Court to win the cases for the Sheikh. Doss Pasha then said that he was pretty certain not only that the Armenian lawyers, whom the Sheikh has hitherto employed, were out to keep the litigation going (a fact which we had always realised in the Foreign Office, I think), but also that the Sheikh himself was anxious to lose the cases so that he might draw compensation in hard cash from His Majesty's Government! In any case, the Pasha said, there was no doubt that the Sheikh's cases had in the past been very badly prepared and handled in the Iraqi Courts, and the present cases would have been lost but for the intervention -VT of the Egyptian lawyer. I understand that the present position is that the Court has adjourned the hearing so as to permit the claimants to answer Rushdy Bey's 'conclusions'. Doss Pasha is, of course, naturally out to magnify the role/ Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l.role of his Egyptian colleague, but it is interesting that he should spontaneously volunteer the point about the Sheikh ^ wishing to lose the cases. I do not remember that we ever suspected the Sheikh of going quite as far as that! Incidentally, Doss Pasha said that if the cases eventually came up on Appeal to the Iraqi Court of Cassation he would be very happy to handle personally the Sheikh f s case. He did not, however, mention the fee he would ask for doing sol Yours ever.

However, it is of course hardly possible for us to say what sort of fees a good lawyer in Basra could fairly expect, and as time is getting so short, I would suggest, again assuming Treasury concurrence* that the best course would be to telegraph to Peterson and de Gaury to concert together on the fee, giving the latter authority to go as high as £150 for the basic fee and ’refreshers’ for this hearing. 5. There is one further point to v/hich I would draw your attention in connexion with the statement drawn up by Rushdi Bey and enclosed in your letter. This statement brings out the international issues before the court, and if the court accepts the argument develoj^ed in it, so much the better. We consider it most important, hov/ever, that the Sheikh should be in a position to defend the case on its merits , if he must. Indeed, that was why the Embassy at Cairo were specially asked to secure for him an expert on Ottoman land lav/. It may of course be that the statement you have sent us is only the first instalment, as it were, of Rushdi Bey’s activities, and that the Sheikh’s lav/yer is in fact already fully briefed on the technical side of the case. In view of the issues involved/(W; ttjc. o - . O'. -Tw - C involved we feel, however, that it would he only rirjht to make quite sure that this is so. 6 .

The situation is that the hearing of the case took place this morning before the Basra Court, and was postponed until Ijth April. 2. Captain de Gaury is of the opinion that the visit of the Lawyer, Ahmed Rushdi, has been well worth while. In consultation with the Shaikh's local Lawyer, Abdul Jalil Partu* he drew up the statement of pleading on behalf of the Shaikh. This document is of course of importance as it is on this that the case with mainly he fought. His presence also gave considerable moral support to Abdul Jalil, and has had a good effect in local public opinion, which is following the case with considerable interest. T have also seen Ahmed Rushdi in company with Captain de Gaury for a brief discussion of the case, and he made a favourable impression. Ahmed Rushdi is not of the opinion that it will be of any substantial advantage fcr him to remain for the hearing 0 n the Ilth and is returning to Cairo forthwith. He points out that as far as he can see there will be many further postponements on a number of small points, and Judge Lloyd has confirmed this to de Gaury.to de Gaury* It could be left open for the present whether Rushdi should return when the parties really get at grips with each other* opinion that it would be worth while for His Majesty's Government to engage a certain Mirza Muhammad Ahmed* a member of the Basra bar who has ability and local influence of the sort that will assist in the peculiar conditions prevailing in Iraq Courts. In addition to I this the case is so complicated that Abdul Jalil is in need of assistance* 5. I concur, and if the Shaikh agrees, I suggest that Mirza Muhammad be employed at His Majesty's Government's expense. Captain de Gaury believes that this individual*s service could be obtained for about £150. If this is approved I suggest that Mr. Weightraan be telegraphed accordingly, with repetition to Captain de Gaury. In the meantime Captain de Gaury is of the T.C.

In the circumstances the dispute is now regarded tc have taken place between Great Britain and the Government of Iraq ns the latter being responsible for the rights of her subjects who are her own peoole. by saying that the dispute is raised between Great Britain and the Government of Iran we our indication on the aaarantee referred to above which has been assumed by the British Government towards the Gmirate of &gt;uwait ^or the protection of those properties which are the subject of the suit under review. Gow we have to discuss Whether the relations effected between Great Britain and the Government of Iraq allow the ordinary Courts in Iran to pass decision in such dispute or the sa le is beim* outside their province. ,ar was declared against Turkey on 6th November 1914 when Iraq was one of the Turkish Vilayets. The English troons occupied the i^aarah Vilayet on 6th November 1914, and, by virtue of her occupation she had the same rights as usuallyenjoyed by any Goverment in the occupied lan'is. The Iraqi lands remained under the Occupation of the dritish Government since that date until 1922 when she made agreement with the Iraqi Nation and had also concluded another Agreement thereafter under a Treaty executed in 1926, 30th oune 1930 she hod executed further Treaty designed as ’’Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and iraq” which Treaty had, in Article (7), covered a convention which reads as follows i- “This Treaty replaces the two treaties of Alliance ‘‘signed at Baghdad on the 10th day of October 1922 ’’'corresponding to 19th Gafar 13^1 and on the 16th January '1926 corresponding to 28th Jamadl el Akhar 1344 as well as 'the supplementary conventions thereof which shall be 're re a led when this Treaty is put into execution'. Therefore, the Treaty of 1930 became in force instead of the other treaties previously concluded between Great Britain and the Kingdom of Iraq. This Treaty covered a clear definition whereby the Kingdom of Iraq is bound to resoect any ;njarantee given by the British Government to others since such guarantee is not being in contravention with the covenant of the league of Nations and the Treaty for the prevention of war. In other word it has been stipulated that thia guarantee, which should be esteemed, became a legitimate one possessed by those who had assumed the same. The following is the text embodied in the Treaty of 193^:- 'Article (9). Nothing in this Treaty which nffects whatsoever 'or aims at the breach of rights and guarantees attached or 'being attached to or against any of the high contracting 'parties in conformity with the Covenant of the league 'Nations or the Treaty for the prevention of Gar signed at 'Garis on the 27th day of August 1928'. It will therefore be gathered from the foregoing that Great Britain and the Iraq Kingdom had made an agreement of friendship tmm - VII/ which proviies that no one of the contracting oarty should - offend the other or affect his interests in the interior or outside or his relationship with the other Jtales• This alliance had also provided that the puarantees against Great Britain should be esteemed by the Iraqi l in^do.a. It has been outlined above th^t : n//land had assumed a guarantee towards the dmirate of Kuwait to safecoiard the properties in Basrah of the said vnirate which specifically involve -’ada-rhia property as well* The matter did not end at this point but the Treaty of 1930 embodies a definition governing the solution method to be adopted when any dispute creeps in between both Gtates in connection with the interpretation or application of this Treaty, rticle 10 provides an follows ;- ” ftien any dispute takes place in connection with the application of this Treaty or the interpretation thereof and both the hi^h contracting parties did not come to conclusion by direct negotiation amonr them the dispute may then be treated in conformity with the provisions of the Covenant of the Leame o ’ Nations* 1 . This definition itself makes this suit outside the duty of the courts in the Iraqi fingdorn as the basis Of the present dispute, as stated above, is confined to the fact that certain Iraqi individuals ere claiming from a foreign Emirate, i.e. the Kuwait Cmirate, for her certain properties in Iraq whilst this -nirate is protected by ar*at aritfein who ensures her properties in xlasrah. The guarantee or covenant o r Great Britain could not be affected by the Alliance Treaty signed between Great Britain and the Kingdom of Iraq by virtue of Article 9 of this Treaty. . .ere re, M . .• i sc mr i • /or tee .... :ct ; interpretation of this Treaty and the application thereof and, it havS been agreed that this interpretation and application is beyond t^e jurisdiction of the ordinary counts, by virtueoif tiiC provisions of , xtrici (10)* it has been renaereci as subject to negotiations between botn States otub* siiOuid ti*ey fail* tnt; dispute should t^en be settled in conformity with Uxe Covenant of ti.e league of Nations* The Covexiaiit of the l eague of Nations which had organised tne relationship of tue States who acceded thereto had, likewise, taken into consideration such event as well, tor Articxe (lb) oi tills Covenant provides as follows »*Tn« members of hue League agree that any dispute which arises and they consider that such dispute is soiv&amp;bie Uj raeans of arbitration but eoulu not be solved satisfactorily in a political way the subject of dispute my then be submitted, as a whole, for arbitration*' Azaong h^e cisputea solvable by arbitration, in general are, it is considered, those which are coitiiected witu t^e iiiterpretatioa of a treaty or with any of the subjects of the International ,.aw or witii the evidence of any event tne affirmation of which involves Infringeiaent of a;* International guarantee aiiu/or with ti*e auount arid kiiid of tae indemnity required for similar infringement* Besides tae foregoing, His Highnees Shaikh Ahmad el Jauir el Sabah is one of tne defendants ana it u&amp;s already been agreed and recognised by tne Govt.of Iraq that he is tne T ;uler of an iadepeiidant .mirate protected by Great Britain ana, by virtue of fcnis position ana standing duly f recognised by tne Govt*of Iraq, ne exijoys all international privileges usually enjoyed by tne Kin and residents of Cations, hence it is not appropriate tnat he should undergo litigation persoiially nor can ne be litigated in an ordinary court, but any matter* arfStng between him and a certain State or individuals of certain state should be solved through tue political methods.

Tewlfc Doas Pasha . Copt. Born about 1875. Son of Doss Zigeim, a bible-colporteur in Asslout. Brought up as a Presbyterian, but has latterly verted, and plays a reactionary (and allegedly lucrative) role in Coptic Church affairs. Was once a dragoman in the ^merican consular agency at Assiout. Well educated (American Mission), with an excellent knowledge of Knglish and Prench; possesses marked ability as a speaker. He made a big reputation for himself defending political prisoners under martial law in the aurly days of the Independence movement - among others, Abdurrahman Pahmy Bey in the ’’Vengeance Society 1 ' trial. Left Zaghlul and became a leading member of the Constitutional Liberal party. Minister of Agriculture in Ziwer Pasha’s Cabinet, March-September 1925, when he fell under palace influence and made desperate attemots to retain office in September 1925, but could not quite manage it. However, he sent in a conditional resignation from the Liberal party, and for some months he ceased to attend party meetings. Stood for the Beni Korra constituency (Assiout) against Ahmed Khashaba Pasha (Wafdiat) in the elections of May 1926. Thanks to strong Ittehadist backing and interference of the Ziwer Government on his side, he was elected Deputy, but resigned when about to be unseated by the Chamber on the charge (justifiable) of electoral irregularities./irregularities. From 1927 on Tewfik Doss’s connexion with the palace has become much closer. He played a prominent part in supporting the candidature of the present corrupt Coptic Patriarch against the reformers, and he was in league with His late Majesty and the Patriarch in certain obscure financial misappropriations of Coptic Waqfs. He was much against the apoointrnent of Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha and in favour of Sidky at the time of the coup d’£tat of 1923, and no one was surprised when, in June 19*30, didky made him Minister of Communications. He joined the 3xcecutive Committee of the Shaabist party in December 1930. He was the Cabinet mouthpiece to foreign press correspondents and the ’’well-informed” source of their telegrams. His tortuous methods coraolicated, but fortunately did not prevent, the Aviation and Wireless and Cables settlements in 1932. Strong suspicions of corruption made him an embarrassing colleague in the Cabinet, but his omission from Sidky Pasha’s second Cabinet in January 1933, for which the late King was responsible, aopeared not to have affected his close personal relations with the Prime Minister. He was suggested for the Washington Legation, wtiere he could hardly have been persona grata, but 'preferred to serve his country as a Deouty in the 'Chamber”. After Sidky Pasha’s eclipse ho played a somewhat equivocal role, leaving the main parliamentary attack on his former crony to his brother Wahib. A third brother, Habib, supported the Government in the Senate.He is no longer persona grata in the palace, but would no doubt like to be so again.

The exolauantiou according to the surviving male heirs of kubarak, and their de^cendente, is that the Feddaghiya garden was itself the ;k-.ultri bl &lt;&gt;alt or the third of property disposable by testament under Moslem Law. (b) A eeoond point is that the duty of admiiii strati on was previously in the hanas of two former ulers of Kuwait, in their ox'tier of succession i,«y, ohelKh Jabir and then sheikh * alim, frori whom it devolved upon i^helxii ivhraad «nd that neither of these two former administrators had powers of attorney or written authoa’ity to administer the estates, g v^n to them by their CO' irs. 6 The India Office letter uuuwr reference raises three points!- (a) From whom should Dis Uajes&amp;y^ Government obtain a discharge, if and when they decide to give compensation for the amount paid in 'isthlak’ tax since 1^52?,(b) The question of privilege in respect of service of documents. (c) whether oui* pledge extends to gardens owned by persons other thou the Buling sheikh for the ti^e being f when there •till is a Ruling oheikh. The answer to (b) and (c) seems, subject to your opinion, to be clear. (a) Privilege cannot be held to extend to anyone other than the i.uler. (b) Our pledge must extend to other persons so long as they are 'descendants' of Sheikh Mubarak, ?/hieh all the present owners are. vith regard to (a) X trust that it will be decided that payment can and should be roade to the Ruler of Kuwait, administrator of the estate, and a discharge obtained from him. As payments of all kind in connection with the estates have so far been made to hira X see nothing against it. If it is considered essential, in order to cover His Majesty’s Government , his general discharge to us could include signed acknowledgements by ail the other i.eirs chat the payment to dheikh .Ahmed had discii&amp;i*gO(j t.&gt;ie obligation, hut I do not think that we should go farther than this, as, for example, at tempting a direct se tleLient wYlth each aeir, altering a state of affairs m which tne descendants ox Mubarak have acquiesced for over twenty years; curing the period of Rulership of throe sheikhs of Kuwait. .

My aear Baggallay, With reference to my telegram Wo. 12 of January 27th, I am sending you herewith a copy of a note on the case of the service of documents on the agent of the Shaikh of Kuwait which Brickell obtained privately from Lloyd (the British Judge at Basra). The Shaikh 1 s telegram seems to have been a most unfortunate blunder. Yours ever, (Sgd) James Morgan. H. L. BAGGALLaY, ES^.application for a date to 'be fixed for hearing the action against the Shaikh of Kuwait was made some months ago hy the attorney for the plaintiff. A date was fixed and the Ministry of Justice replied to the Court’s application to serve the summons on the Shaikh of Kuwait that it was not possible, attorney for the plaintiff then declared in Court that Abdul Jalil Parto held a General Power of Attorney from the Shaikh of Kuwait and that he should be served and that if his power dia not include the right to accept service then the Shaikh of Kuwait should be served either through the British Consul, Basra (as the Shaikh of Kuwait was a British Subject) or by notice in the Press. The Court held that neither of these latter alternatives was possible under the law because service through a Consul only applied in the case of foreigners resident within the jurisdiction of the Court and that service by proclamation and notice in the Press could only be allowed when the where abouts or the Shaikh were unknown whereas in fact his place of residence was known. The Court however decided to serve his Attorney Abdul Jalil Parto. This did not mean that the Court had decided in advance that they would compel Abdul Jalil to accept service. It was complying with the request of the plaintiff to attempt service on the Attorney who could of course refuse to accept such service if not empowered. When the Bailiff attempted to serve Abdul Jalil the latter refused and the Bailiff in accordance with article 28 of the Civil Procedure Code served the summons in the presence of 2 witnesses. This did not mean that the Shaikh was effectively served. Abdul Jalil could have appeared in Court and said that his power of attorney did not permit him to accept service. The Court after confirming this statement by examining the Power of Attorney would in law be obliged to admit that the service was not good and the old Stalemate would recur. But in this case the Shaikh sent a telegram direct to the President of the Court stating that he had cancelled the power/pov/er of. attorney given to Abdul Jalil. ; 7hen tho Court re-assembled this was discussed. My Iraqi colleagues held that this telegram was proof of service. But in the end the Court adjourned its decision for a week. During this week I happened to be in Baghdad and privately discussed the point v/ith Drower to see if there was any legal objection to the view that by sending the telegram at that particular moment the Shaikh had shown that he v/as aware that an action was being brought against him on a particular date which constitutes service. Mr. Drower agreed with me and I understand informed Captain Holt i-^ivately of this. On my return to Basrah the Court re-assembled and we held that the Shaikh had been served and ordered the case to be proceeded with against him in absentio. V/ith regard to his partners in the estate who are co-defendants the . Court found that their place of residence was unknown and that they should be served by notice in the press.

This would bring resumption of the case very near the beginning of the Iraqi Long Vacation, in Mid June, . s o that the case might in the end drag on for about seven months# On the other hand he thought a good defence might show that the plaintiff's case was very ill-founded and the motive merely 'blackmail''. I I quote his word(, so that it could he dismissed in a few hours. 7 . Considering what I have recorded in these two immediately preceding paragraphs, the nature of the case, and Its locale, and the fact that a British or European lawyer, if employed, could not, from a professional relish of pleading, be led into prolonging the case, I feel sure that only such a lawyer can be railed upon as being anxious to terminate it rapidly and successfully for the Bheixh, and f or His Britannic Majesty’s Government.

Political Agent, Kuwait. —■ With reference to your letter of the 20th January (No.S.277/23/93) I enclose a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident about the ownership of the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens. telegram of 31st August, 1930, was sent to the Foreign Office under cover of Colonial Office Printed Letter No.78214/30 of the 1st September, 1930, while a copy of his demi official letter of 1st September, 1930, was sent to Rendel under cover of Laithwaite's demi official letter No.P.6065/30 of the 1st October, 1930. If the papers are not readily traceable I can let you have copies. Further information in regard to the point at issue is given in the enclosed extract from the Political Resident's Despatch No.27-T of 7th November, 1930, addressed to the Colonial Office. Subject to whatever the Political Resident may have to say in his promised communication it would According to our records a copy of Biscoe's H. L. Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office. appear/j v 'wt) 4^:2- 2 . appear that of the five main Koweit properties in Iraq_, three belong (or belonged in 1930) jointly to the Sheikh and three of his relatives, while the remaining two are owned by 0 * 1 1 over a hundred members of the Sheikhly family. So far as we are aware, however, all the properties are held and registered in Iraq in the name of the Ruler and if that is the case we ought not to have any difficulty about dealing v/ith the Sheikh alone in the matter of the proposed compensation for losses due to the Istihlak tax. But we can examine the point further when we get the Resident’s comments.4^5 Extract from Despatch No.27 T. dated 7th November , 1930, from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary oi State for the Colonies. (P.8350/30). 8. Of the five properties, three belong jointly to the Shaikh and three other members of his family. These, I believe, he would dispose of at a reasonable valuation. The other two properties however are divided among about 100 shareholders, many of them poor members of the Al-3ubah family. The disposal of these latter properties is a much more difficult matter. It will be necessary to obtain the consent of all the shareholders. Prom these gardens the owners obtain dates, lucerne, wheat, date matting, etc., etc., and on these they and their families and retainers subsist. There are no date gardens in Kuwait itself which these owners could purchase in place of the 'Iraq properties and cash is of very little use to them since they will not take interest and there are few facilities for investing it in other forms of property. Many of them would inevitably squander any cash payment they might receive in a few years and then be left destitute, and Sir Ahmed said that the nolicy of his ancestors had always been to provide for the needs of the family in kind rather than in cash. However, if three of the properties are sold it is possible that the Shaikh may come to some friendly arrangement with the 'Iraq authorities over the other two provided the latter adopt a reasonable and accommodating attitude. Possibly they might arrange for instance to buy out the right of exemption from taxation. — \T?*v+.T»nr»-h -P-pom d. O f*r*r)m d«o« letter No«462—S of* (P. 6065/30). 'Whereas the Padaghiyeh property might possibly he disposed of as only four persons had to he consulted, that of Fao was in a totally different category. It was owned hy about 120 members of the Subah family - males and females - and he saw no hope of their all being induced to part. It was not a question of owning property only, but the possessors (including many old ladies) their servants, hangers on, etc., got their dates, fruit, wheat, barley, bhoosa, lucerne, firewood, date branches, mats, etc., etc., all off their respective properties. Their gardens were their all and many had no other means of livelihood. Money in lieu would never satisfy them for they were forbidden to put it out at interest. In other words, said the Shaikh, the Fao property was the life-blood of the rulers of Kuwait and their family as well as of two-thirds of the people of Kuwait.”Extract from Telegram No. 68 ,, . lated 31st August 1930, from Pol ^^ f R ®?ate .n the Persian Gulf to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (P.5852/30). The Sheikh felt pessimistic as regards result of negotiations as of main properties involved first the Fadaghiyeh estate held hy four sons of Muharak had been bought for eighty thousand pounds and naturally nothing less than such a figure could be acceptable while second estate situated around Fao and four times the size of former was held in trust for over one hundred male and female living members of Subah family all of whom had recognised share allotted under Islamic Law and every single member would have to dispose of his or her share before any sale could be effected. Lastly and perhaps most important Sheikh dwelt on question of family prestige for property alone had been in his family for nearly one hundred and twenty years and a revolution might easily be caused in Koweit by any suggestion of its sale out of family.■Ml14th Extracts from a demi-official letter No.306, dated September 1930, from Lt. Colonel H. R. P. Oi c^son , Political A^ent, Kuwait. ^ f/Z da 2. In my telegram No.271 of 30th August I mentioned that the two main properties involved were the ^ada.ghiyeh and Epo Estates but in my N. 0. which followed, I think I implied that these two Estates were the only ones concerned. In order to rectify any wrong impression that I may have given, I would like to add that the two properties already given, are the main estates, situate to the North of the Eadaghiyeh, which also are exempt from ta.xa.tion by Iraq. These are of course much smaller ones and commencing from the South and going North, are called £T The Earhaniyeh estate originally bought for 1000 7 - M Mutaawah ' ' ” ' 22000/- M Ajairawiyeh M ” ” ' 5000./- If therefore we add the above values to those of the ■^adaghiyeh and ^ao properties, namely £ T. 80,000/- and -'T.3,00,000/- , we find that the original value of the properties all together comes to some £T.4,08,000/-. This we may call in round figures £T. 5,00,000/- seeing that property has gone up in value considerably in the last 50 years or so. 10. One very interesting thing the Tazir s^id he had gleaned from the Qaimakam Shatt si Arab was that Iraq strongly objected to the Kuwait properties being held and registered in Iraq, in the name of t he Rulers of Puws.i t, and before everything else his government intended to try and have the properties divided up and registered in the name of each individual holder of the properties (some 120).KG/DI A, 1 ‘if it 10 Da CYPHER 0 Prom 3 ?

My dear Baggallay, I am sorry that the reply to your letter K 7332/53/93 of December 13th about the Sheikh of Roweit*8 date—gardens has been, for various reasons, somewhat held up, but as we have heard nothing further from you it is probable that Clark-Kerr found a reliable and impartial lawyer in Iraq. As soon as I received your letter I referred to Besly, our Legal Counsellor, and he tells me that he could not recommend any lawyer here for this particular purpose other than an Egyptian; and that as regards Egyptians he would suggest the following as worthy of consideration, although it is hard for him to make any recommendation with authority, since he has not had personal experience of their court work:- (1) Salib Bey Sarny - an ex-Minister of War and a competent lawyer with whom Besly has worked on committees. (2) Jewfik oss Rasha - a competent lawyer well- known to His Majesty’s Government. (3) Yahib Bey Does - brother of the above, less political but equally competent. It is probable that you will prefer some less conspicuous figure than any of these three. Besly feels sure that a suitable man could be found ad hoc when theinecessity arises. But, to find him, Besly would have to seek Egyptian advice and to disclose the purpose at least in general terms. Before doing this we propose waiting till you tell us whether you really want us to take further action. fours ever, (Signed) J, C. 3TERNDALB BENNETT. H. L.

In reply to your letter No*C-292 dated 4.10.5b (y.l2.3yj I am pleased to inform you that the power of attorney granted to our agent in Iraq does not give him the right of acceptance of legal documents connected with the case, therefore, you can see that every effort made in this direction is illegal.

Under all circumstances we shall do according to what ever H.B.lPs Govt, deems fit. Therefore, I would like to know whether it would not impair our position, in future, before the Iraq Courts if we accept to defend in principle and according to the circumstances mentioned by you, and do you not think it will be prejudicial to our rights and at the same time will not our acceptance to defend impair the promises made to us by H.B.M’s Govt. ?

Addressed to Bagdad No. 8; repeated to Cairo No. 49, Bushire No. 3 and Koweit No. 2.(E 277/28/93) Dear Gibson, Will you please refer to Bagdad telegram No.6 of the 15th January aBout the Sheikh of Koweit’s date Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, meant when he told the Embassy (of. paragraph 2) that the Sheikh ’’is not the only ,r person concerned u . Admittedly, one might, under Ottoman law, have expected the interest in Sheikh Mubarak’s properties to be inherited in common after his death by all his heirs, as happened on the death of Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah. That is what Mr. Drower seems to be getting at, and if this is what indeed happened the part owners of what we usually call the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens may no doubt by now have become legion. 5. In fact, however, (although we have heard before that other members of the Shei/Jily family have property in % gardens (see our letter E 277/28/93 of the 14th January). 2. Y/e are not quite clear what Mr. Drower, the 2 ! JAN 1938 INDIA OFFICE Iraq/ J.?. Gibson, Esq. yIraq, and have for instance told them that they cannot claim immunity from service in the same way as the Sheikh ^ himself) we have always assumed here that the Sheikh is the sole owner of the properties covered hy the 1 j 14 pledge. It is, for instance, as you will remeniber, proposed, if and when His Majesty’s Government give compensation for the amount paid in Istihlak tax since 1952 in respect of the gardens covered hy that pledge, to pay the whole money to the Sheikh and obtain a discharge from him and him alone. At any rate nobody seems ever to have given any thought to any other proceeding. Perhaps some special arrangement applies in this x^s^ticular case, b^ which the property is handed down intact from one ruling Sheikh to the next? We should be grateful for any light you can throw on the matter. 4. The point is of some practical interest, since (1) no privilege in respect of service of documents can be claimed by any member of the family except the ruling Sheikh, and it would hardly seem that his privilege would be effective to cover properties of which he is only a part owner. (2) it is a question whether our pledge extends to gardens owned by persons other than the Ruling Sheikh for/Tor the time heing, when there still is a Ruling sheikh.Department. . x A. no. 4 *«p- £ ^ fbagtUUj , Jot.. &amp;U4JL+* Vh*X4*J~ W4&lt;5 2.

It Dear Gibson, With reference to the correspondence ending in our telegram No. 2 of the 4th January to Bagdad about engaging the services of Salman Sheikh Daud, I am sending you a copy of a telegram from Morgan, who is now in charge of the Embassy there. / 2. It was never, of course, intended that the Embassy should engage Salman Daud (or ’’brief” him either) on their own behalf, but merely that they should ask him to act on the Sheikh* s behalf. But we feel that there may be weight in Morgan*s objections to Salman Daud s dealing direct with the Embassy at all. Salman Daud will in any case have to get the material for his case from the Sheikh at any rate as far as the substance of the actions is concerned and as the case is to be heard in Basra the Sheikh*s agent there would seem the simplest and most direct/direct channel of communication between the Sheikh and his lawyer. 3. Clearly we shall have to keep a careful watch on the way Salman Daud handles the case, and be ready to give him guidance on the tactics to be followed. Prom the practical point of view, however, it might well actually be preferable for this to be done by de Gaury, since he can discuss matters with the Sheikh at each stage without loss of time. 4. You will see that Morgan has repeated his telegram to Powle and de Gaury. Subject to any observations they may make, we are inclined for the reasons I have given to agree with Morgan’s suggestion./f' n I-. o L. Ilhv »»«■ * 9 f~\ ’ .’ O o 4 NO DISTRIBUTION. D ec ode.

Mow in your last letter you have changed your request and wish the transaction to be in the name of your son Nasir Bey and his brithers only. This we cannot say to the Por te as it will be contradictory to the request and vdll draw their attention to what Moharrem effendi had written. If you wish to refer to the Porte and they send an enquiry about the matter, I regret I cannot say anything except what was said previously,on the strength of which we got the consent of the Porte. You have vast properties here, and can therefore order to give these properties to you son Nasir Bey and let the Fadaghiya transaction go as arranged and thus solve the problem. This is my view but you know your own interest best. Peace be upon you and God's blessings. 4th.Gumad Akhir 1328 Viali of Y/ilaya Seal. 30th .March 19 After these letters it happened that Great B r it a i n occupied Basra on the 6 th.November 1915 and in accordance v/ith the agreement that existed bet- -«een her and H.H.Sheikh Ei Kv/eit in which she guaranteed to preserve for him and for his successors all his properties in Basra,andexempt him from the ta xes on those properties,the Minister of Finance (Mr.Henry Doyce) ordered that a Tabo be given to H.H.Sheikh El Kweit for these properties which were regis tered in the name of his sons at the Ib.bo Of f ic e, Basra, in accordance with a document worded as follows :- N.13,14,15,16,17 and 18 dated Aab 1915. Ahmad Pasha A1 Zohair as agent for his wife Mine Aisha Bint Abdalla Jala- bi A1 Zohair,has appointed as his agent Abdel Y/ahab Psha Al Kirtas in accordance with given by the Basra Court on 26th.Zil Ki'da 1326, in the- 19 W / * sale of Palm plot owned by her. The agent sold it to Sheikh Mubarak Pasha A1 Sab bah. At ten end, and in accordance with a letter from the Tabo Office, dated Qth.Shabat 1324,requesting the ]resence of the agent Abdel VJhhab Pasha A1 Kirtes (it was known) that the Ottoman Govt.had ordered that the transaction be deferred in order to notify a third person. The agent Abdel V.'anab Pasha, and Sheikh Mubarak came to the British Consulate and admitted these facts and the Consul at Shabat approved the deed of sale dated 21st Moharram 1327 alter the admission of the agent and the order given by the Finance Inspector on I4th.Heziran 1915,N.504. The sale has therefore been proved; and in accor dance with the request submitted by Abdel Aziz El Salim,the agent for Sheikh Mubarak,and in accordance with the request submitted by Abdel Aziz El Salim, the agent for Sheikh Mubarak, end in accordance with a written request bea ring the seal of the Sheikh,that the Tbbo document should be made in the na me of the sons, -hich is in conformity with the deed; in accordance with these documents a T&amp;bo document was given in the name of the children,v/ho also ha ve another document for the trees. The trees are included in the sale. Ac cordingly the property has been registered in the name of Gaber, Salim,Nasi r, Ahmad and Abdalla sons of the Sheikh Moberak Al Sabbah . These are the stages through which that sale passed. The writ states that these documents are not legal without plaintiff giving any cause for their illegality. It seems he v/ishes to say that they were not made in accordance with the regulations of the lb bo or in other words that the deed is not authen tic i.e. was not made before the competent official. This is what v/e think our adversary i.e. the plaintiff,wishes to say. We use the words H v/e think' here, because there is no mention in the writ of the cause of the illegality of the documents of ownership of the defendants. That which we think,that the offer and the acceptance in the deed of sale must be made before an authorized official is not a condition sine-qua-non most in most countries. In Egypt sale is effected by mere offer and acceptance without any further action. So is the case in France,and in Mohammedan La :. Because the sale and purchase of freehold properties are private rights in the exercices of \tfiich individuals are given complete liberty,without any hinderence due toany forns.lity to be taken. Such hinderence is not compatible v.'ith the speed that economic dealings demand, and will defeat the interests that the rules of economic uphold. There are,hov;ever,transactions which many lav/s subject to formali ties, such as mortgage in Egypt and in France, the sale of government pro perties or properties which are irregularly endowed in Iraq,and mrriage. The reason for subjecting these transactions to formalities is evident. For marriage for example entails proof of lineage (ancestry) which is the right of others. Neverthless marriage has been only recently subjected to formality. Similarly mortgage has very serious consequences,which are the stripping of the mortgagor from his property. Subjecting it to formality affords time to the mortgagor to think of his future, and an obstacle is also laid which may cause the mortgagor to give up the idea. On this point Maitre Shakir El Hanbali says in his work on the Land Law 'There is no doubt that the entry of sales,bequests and mort gages in the Sultanic Register Off ices,and the giving to the purchaser,or to the person to whom the bequest is made,or to whom the mortgage is made a sultanic document,is very useful in regulating these dealings. But to ignore these transac tions if they are concluded outside the sultanic register offices,and preventing judges from hearing cases arising in respect to property not bound by Sultanic documents,or in other words to apply the rules appertaining to government land to transactions for ordinary properties is doubtful as to its accordance with Mohammedan Law. Indeed special rules may be laid for transactions affecting government land, to serve best the interests of the treasury,as these properties belong to the treasury. But private properties are governed by Mohammedan Law. A1 Maggalla has stated that everyone may do what he likes with his property provided he does not harm the property of others; and that deeds made by persons viio- 21 s'® 2 ' have the right to make them are correct. Sale,bequest,or mortgage of property which takes place outside the Sulta- nic Register Office is legally correct. The non-hearing of the case in disputes that arise between the vendor and the purcheser,bequather and person bequated to,or mortgagor and mortgagee in respect to property,at the Sliari'ya or ordinary courts,and non-judgment in them after the admission of the adversary,because the case is not heard,will lead to the loss of right and the defeat of the object of the law”. That officiality which plaintiff wishes to say that the documents of ownership of the defendants lack,has therefore no justification for its existence. Keverthless,is that officiality a necessary condition for both parties of the deed ? In other v/ords must acceptance be made the same as the offer before an authorized official ? It ias agreed in may laws as in France and Egypt that it is the of fer that must take place in front of the competent official, because the vendor is transferring his property v/hich was registered under his name to the other party. In Egyptian and French laws, this has been particularly made a condition in regard to mortgage of immovable property. With regard to the acceptance this can be made in any form, even by the use of the official deed wich contains the offer of the mortgagor, as for example when the debtor to whom the proper ty is mortgaged submits the deed for resgistration. ;/e must not forget, to record here,however, that the condition of offi ciality of deeds and their registration,and the non-observance of this con dition does not affect the contrecting parties. Any effect that the deficien cy of these formalities may have exist* only betv/een tv/o persons contesting the subject of the deed. This have been observed by almost all laws even in Iraq. On 5th.July 1919 a proclamation was issued by the sub-coramander-in- chief of the Iraq Expiditionary Force,in which it is said in Art 3 :- 'Neverthless if any one solde property that is purely his own,by an ordinary non-registered deed,and then it came(^) - 22 - out that he or his heirs,or his agent soli the same property or mortgaged it to another person who had it registered in the l&amp;bo Of f ice w ithout knowledge of the existence of the ordinary deed,the ordinary deed shall not Be enforced on the person holding the registered deBd”. On ISth.Nisan 1922,the Iraq Govt.issued a law called 'law of Unregis tered Sales' and of which art 6 rins as follows 'shall not be enforced on any one who gains ownership of the land under another deed from the same seller or his heirs or the persons who acquire the land after him,if that other deed has been registered in the Ifebo Office,without knowledge of the previous unregistered deed'. Similarly the Kgyptian Govt,issued a law for the resgistration of deeds embodying this principle. This is law N.I 8 and 19 for 1923. Art I of that law states the following 'All deeds concluded betweea living persons,which establish a right of ownership or any other property immovoable right,or transfer,change or abolish such a right,and final judgments which lead to a similar result,must be given publicity by means of registration in the 'greffe' of the court of first instance within the circumscription of which the property lies, or in the Mohammedan Law court, taking into consideration the laws at present in force in matters of priviledges,mortgage,judicial affectations etc. Non registration entails that the rights referred to, shall not be established,jiransferred or changed,either between the contrac ting parties,or in respect to others. Non-registered deeds will have no value other than the personal obligations between the contracting parties. The rules embodied in this article shall be restricted to the rules regarding the transfer of ownership end other real rights'. In referring to this law the Egyptian Court of Cassation states23 'The deed of sale is a bilateral deed which becomes complete ana produces its effects immediately the two parties mutually agree to it. The only effect that the Re Cl istration Law has created regar ding the deed of sale ms that the transfer of ownership which in accordance with paragraph I art 266 of the civil Code was a necessary result of a valid sale immedialely the deed is mde - that transfer is now delayed till after registration has taken place. As for the other consequences of the sale, these still hold and have not been changed by the Land Re gistration Law : The seller has still,in accordance with the deed to hand over the object sold, and to transfer ownership to the buyer; the buyer is still compelled to pay the price and so on in regard to the obligations that devolve on each party as a result of the sale'. It appears from these rules that the deed is not considered inexistent because of the non-completion of these formalities; but its legal consequen ces are delayed as the Egyptian Court of Cassation says until 'those forma lities have been completed. This is with regard to the contracting parties. As for third parties preference is given to the one who completes these for malities . The rule we have given is not new. There is a n old saying 'He who tries to undo what has been completed on his part will have his efforts turned against him'. V/e now return to examine the following point : Do the Lav/s in Iraq really demand that the offer and acceptance in ca ses of sale of private property must be given before an authorized official ? A rue it is that all legal references that deal with this poiht affirm that the laws of Iraq imposes that condition, but none of those references gave the source from which it derived that view. We referred to the laws re gulating the sale of immovable property foremost among which is the law of transactions of immovable property. V/e find that this lav/ stated in Art Iplace in the offices of the Sultanic register only,and the parties carrying out the transactions should be given a Sul tanic document. Just as it is prohibited to carry out a transaction v/ithout a document, so is it prohibited to hear the case in the Sha- ri’ya or ordinary courts or carry out the transaction in a Govt office or lands for v/hich no Sultanic document is produced, if that land lies in the localities v/here records and demarcation have been made in accordance with the law M . The wording of this article shows that the transactions v/hich it affects are those relating to Govt.and «feqf lands only and no reference whatever is made to private properties. To include private property under this article is contrary to its wording. It might be understood from the statement 'Just as it is prohibited to carry out a transcription without a document so is it prohibited to hear etc... 'it might be understood from this statement that it ref ere to private proper ties. But such an understanding would be wrong because the transactions re ferred to in this article are the transactions specified at the beginning of the article,which are the transactions relating to Govt.and V/aqf lands. Si milarly if we refer to what is called 'the Nizam of the , Ikbo' , &gt; we f ind it sta tes the following in Art I 'As the financial officers,the director of Finance and the Governors of the Provinces are authorized to government lands outside,they are in the position of the owner of the land'. This article also refers to Govt lands only. Again if v/e note that Art 3 begins v/ith the following statement : 'If anyone desires to give up land ' 'It is evident that giving up land does not occur in the case of private property'. All these rules do not in any way imply that Ikbo documents must be pro cured in the case of private proprty. Sven if they did,and they mde private- 25 - property subject to the rules of the Ikbo^ret they would not annul the deeds, but merely delay their consequence as in the IS^yptian Law,until the formali ties have been completed. This is positively so, as all these laws and these rules always state that the case for the property shall not be heard,and do not state that the deed shall ue considered null. Here we hasten to say that in the dispute we are defendants and not plaintiffs. we decided to see the origin of this jurisprudence as we have not been able to trace it to those lav/s; we mean the necessity for the offer and accep tance to be made before a competent official. In our research we referred to the judgments of the Iraq Court of Cassation and found all agree that 'The sale of immovable property outside the Sultanic Regis ter Office is not valid.” These judgments were all based on Art I of These judgments generalise in saying the sale of immovable property and we fail to grasp whether they mean the sale of private properties or others. As they were based on Art I of the law of ' and that article mentions only Govt.and Waqf proper ties,these judgments therefore refer only to this kind of property. But the same judgments also referred to issued in Iloul ISIS. Te wished to refer to the wording of this Ira da but could not find it anywhere, only found instructions issued by the Uinister of Interior to the 'Tilayas enforcing that Irada. On referring to these ins tructions v/hich incur opinion have not the force of law,we find they state the following :- M As a sultanic irada has been issued preventing courts from hearing cases that arise between parties to confirm sales and purchases made by ordinary deeds, the attention of all parties in any such transaction must be drawn to hasten to procure documents. This must be given publicity in the whole wilaya by publication in the local papers and by other means”. .7e see from the wording of these instructions also that they do not in validate deeds,but merely prevent the hearing of the case. There is a great387 26 difference betv/een the invalidation of the deed and the prevention of the hearing of the case. Neverthless,do the defendants lack Tbtbo documents in the present case T Sheikh Mubarak A 1 Sabbah bought these properties from Abdel ..'ahab Pa sha A1 Kirtas as a^ent for Aisha I^anem A1 2 ohair in 1327, Correspondance was exchanged between him and the Porte, in which politics played a certain part, until Great Britain occupied Basra Province. In the course of that correspon dence the Porte acknowledge the validit}' of the transaction and gave order and permission to register it in the Tabo Office,as can be gathered from the letter sent from the uali of Basra in 1328,referred to before. But that order also was not executed for political consideration which do not concern us at present, and which there is no need to mention here,although the letter of the Uali of A 1 Basra referred to above,alludes to them, and hints that Muharraw Sffendi the former V/ali had something to do with those political considera tions . The matter remained in suspense in this manner until Great Britain oc cupied Basra and organized her activities there ? When she examined the questions of the ownership of H.H.the Sheikh,with whom she had been in touch on the sub ject before,she decided that the sale was valid and the Minister of Finance Mr. Henry Doyce issued an order to the Tabo Office to register this property in the name of the owners from whom the defendants inherited it. we have previous ly quoted the wording of the Tabo document in this note. It might be argued that this procedure was not correct. But that argu ment is wrong,for Great Britain when she occupied Basra was a conqueror and had the right to organize affairs in the occupied territory in the manner she saw fit. The Commander-in-chief of the Army of Occupation therefore issued an order in August 1915 organizing affairs in the occupied territory,which he called 'Law of the Iraq Occupied Territories'. In chapter VI of that Law under the title 'Miscellaneous Rules' the following is stated : 'Courts instituted in accordance with this law shall not apply Ottoman penal lav/s,nor laws concerning evidence,nor the Ottoman3 %% - 27 - laws of legal trialB**. ;e say that Great Britain as conquering state had the right to organize affairs in Iraq in the juanner she thought fit, and the officials there no longer got their authority from the laws, but from the orders they received from the Commandor-in-Chief or from the political ruler or his substitue. The officials of the Tabo Office,Basra received a written order from the Minister of Finance - r.henry Doyce to register these properties in the names of the sons of H.H. Sheikh A1 Kweit,and they executed the order. Deeds that actually existed at the time and had hot been registered were not considered null by law, which gave permission to have them registered in the names of the ov/ners, provided that no right had been gained over the pro perty by registration. Among these laws the proclamation issued by the sub- commando r- in -chief in 1919 and also the law issued by the Iraq Govt. in 1922. All this is conclusive that,(first) deeds made outside the Tabo Office were not invalidated (Second) that the authority which the conriander in chief en joyed at the time gave him the right to give that order not in virtue of the lav/ but in virtue of Great Britain being a conqueror. All writers agree that the Govt Officials of the inviding power in the exercice of their work,have the right to give valid orders that have the power of law. Among those writers is Prof.Ahmed Nashaat Bey,prof .of law at the Egyp tian Royal School of Lav/ who says in a book of hi» called M ' 'If the lawful government is overpowered and the invading power appoints an official,his orders will be considered official,because he is an official in fact. If we say that his acuions are not valid,that would lead to the hinderance of people's affairs,and the stoppage of work,as there is no other official. If he issues writings which give people rights or impose upon them civil duties,they must be res pected especially as the writing of deeds,only takes place on the pure wish and agreement of the contractigg parties. There is no doubt that it is in the public interest as well as the private interest that such papers and deeds be consi-f &gt; - 29 - an order being given for the trial. On that date I5th .January the court ordered procedure to be taken by default. This is quite against the law, as article I4i- nodifled,denands that the decision to carry on procedure by default against the defendant only takes place if he is not present on the day fixed ^or the case. Tf no order is given on that day to carry on pro cedure by defau 11 and the case is postponed to some other day for any rea son, a surm ons must be sent to defendant a b ain. In this case the court twice postponed the case and did not order to carry on procedure by default. The third time procedure was ordered although the defendant had not been notified in any way whatever to be present on I5th. January 1938. This procedure is therefore null and it cannot be said that a notification was delivered to the defendants. This is not all. The Court fixed for the case the 23rd.January 1938 and published that in the newspapers,which is also an invalid procedure. Publi cation in the newspapers can only be made of the place of residence of the defendant is unknown. In our opinion therefore, this procedure is null and void. ;7e were compelled to say this in order to make the defense of the case, in every way complete. 7/e therefore insist on our request that plaintiff's case shoulu be dis missed and subsidiarily that the procedure of the notification be considered null and void,and plaintiff be charged with costs of the trial including fees for the defence.

Dear Caccia, You sent me on March 8th, under F.O. / reference No. E. 12C1/14^/593* a copy of an extract from a letter which Thompson had sent you on February 4th, about the Sheikh of Koweit's date gardens. In this extract Thompson, after describing further post ponements of the hearing of the Faddaghiyah case, remarks that 'it begins to look as though this case might drag on until the Greek Kalends'; and he quotes his previous letter of December 14th as evidence that the Sheikh's lawyers do not regard these repeated postponements as inimical to their distinguished client's interests. 2 . I am not sure that the earlier letter entirely justifies this inference. In « * • * * ? ; “ paragraph 2 of that letter the Sheikh's Bagdad lawyer, Nasrat al Farisi, is /reported /reported to have expressed the opinion to Holt that the many postponements of the hearing up to that time hai not been prejudicial to the Sheikh's interests; but it does not appear that' he implied that those interests would not be damaged if a settlement were to be postponed indefinitely. •On the contrary* he is said to have thought that a judgnent would be given at the hearing fixed for December 31st; and the conversation then turned to the question of what the Sheikh could do if the Court of Appeal decided against him. 3 . The Sheikh's ownership of the Faddaghiyah estate was confirmed by the land Settlement Officer; and at first it seems to have been the general opinion that the appeal against this decision would be unsuccessful. In / + paragraph 7 of his letter to Wright at the Treasury, No. £.8412/43^/93 of January 9th, , &gt; / 1942, Crosflthwaite said that the F.O. had no reason to believe that the appeal wouldlot 1 K ' IaAsSAA- tc' h *— a~~J IClh.

The above-quoted paragraph of Thompson's letter of December 14th, however, reports Nasrat al Parisi as taking a very gloomy view of the Sheikh's chances of success. ^ At is true that hia caoo It ^rnnkrtt might be argued that the repeertedpost- pnnp.norrt-1- rvf - 'TtiTti 1 11 'J 11 1 ITI^ jm»i&gt; tn hi^ flHvnntagP su^u. / *»ijTee meanwhile (he^/remains in de facto CwX' possession of the estate ?

A further point is that while the earlier adjournments were applied for by the Sheikh's lawyers and were in seme measure due to their carelessness, it appears that the more recent adjournments have been granted at the instance of his ' opponents. Eence, we still feel (in spite of what is said in paragraph 6 of Thompson's ? / letter of December 14th) that there may be some ground for the suspicion^referred to in the above-quoted paragraph of Hickin- botham's letter to Hay, that the Bench are not too anxious to hear the case; or that there may be political influences at work■■■ mmm it) 5 . paragraph of Lumby's letter to Cros^thwaite No, Ext. 5888/42 of November 14th last). 5« I- y°u share our view that a careful watch should continue to be kept on these put the above considerations to Thompson. Perhaps you would ask him to let you know, after further discussion with Nasrat, whether he is still satisfied, that the repeated postponements of the hearing are not operating to the detri ment of the Sheikh's interests; and, if he should find cause for dissatisfaction, whether/ All the papers at Ext. 1200/43 had previously been copied to us via the Fpreign Office,with the exception of Colonel Prior's letter of December 12th to Mr. Caroe , and Major Hickinbotham's letter of October 14th to Colonel Prior. Paragraph 3 Colonel Prior's letter suggests that the substance, but not a copy, of Major Hickinbotham's letter should be comnunicated , if necessary, to the Foreign Office. 2. Colonel Prior did not send us a copy of Major Hickinbotham's letter until two months after it was written; it is now over five months old. It deals with two different aspects of the date gardens case*- (a) Paragraph 3 MeJb&amp;te&amp;iAv*Jthe registration by the 10th Lana Board of the Sheikh's Fao-Estate, including reclaimed lands on either side of the original property. Major Hickinbotham's letter of August 30th at Ext. 27/43 expressed fears that the Board would not av/ard these reclaimed. lands to the Subah, since 'Iraq law precludes the Land Boards from registering land of this nature in the name of a foreigner”. Apparently this rule had already operated to the detriment of the Sheikh of Ms hammerah. Major Hickinbotham at first proposed that the Iraqi Government should be moved to amend the law to enable an exception to be made in the Sheikh's case., and to authorise the registration of the lands in his name; but in his letter of October 14th he asks merely that the attention of the Iraqi Government should be drawn to the verbal undertaking given by their Foreign Minister on the 29th March, 1941* to the effect that the law in question would not prejudice the rights of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. This is the undertaking referred to in Colonel Prior's telegram of April 3rd, 1941* a-t P.Z.1714/41* Both he and Major Hickinbotham seem to have overlooked the fact that it was afterwards confirmed in writing (Ext.6287/41)* Major Kickinbotham's request was passed on to the Embassy in Colonel Prior's telegram of November 19 th, and their reply of November 23 rd described what they were doing about it. Copies of both these telegrams are below Major Hickinbotham's letter at Ext.l2CC/43 just below. There is a copy of Mr. Thompson's letter to the Foreign Minister at Ext.7123/42* and of2 . - /“ti of the Minister’s reply at Ext . 237 / 43 . The only other recent reference to this icatter is in paragraph 7 of Mr. Thompson's letter of December 14 th to Mr. Caccia at Ext. I 36 / 43 • We may perhaps accept the implication of this paragraph that it is for the political Agent, in conjunction with the Consul-General at Basra, to keep a watch on this aspect of the case. I doubt whether there is anything we can do about it at present. i - (b) Paragraph 2 of Major Hickinbotham's letter deals with the repeated postponement$of the hearing of the appeal in the Faddaghiyah case. The history of these postponements up to October 3 r d is sunmarised in paragraph 4 of ^.Thompson's letter of that date to Colonel Kay (copy at Ext.1200/43 jusi below). There have since been a number of further adjournments. According to the extract from Mr .Thompson's letter to Mr. Caccia of February 4 th at Ext.1164/43» a t least one of these was the fault of the appellant's^ lawyer, and this bears out Major Hickinbotham's contention that whereas the earlier adjournments were applied for by the Sheikh's lawyers, it is now his opponents who are failing to appear and being granted adjournments. In these circumstances it seems doubtful whether the complacency displayed in Mr. Thompson's letter of February 4ik (which should be read with his earlier letter at Ext. 1MA3) is justifiable; at any rate I do not think there can be any harm in our suggesting to the Foreign Office that we do not share it. The draft below is in this sense. 3• There does not seem to. be anything in paragraph 4 Major Hickinbotham's letter of October 14 th which could profitably be passed on to the Foreign Office in. however modified a form. ^ 4« Your note at Ext. 6402/42 said that you would be interested to see^the rest of the story about the prohibition on the export orpCraqi date crop, which had prevented the shipment of dates from the Sheikh's gardens to Koweit and Aden. The next paper about this is at Ext. 6632 / 42 , which you have already seen. Further correspondence is at Ext. 1252/43, 1201/43 and 1095/43 (that is their chronological order). A telegram from the Political /Resident 13 Resident of March 1st (on the general question of food supplies for the Gulf States) indicateet that the export prohibit ion had by then been entirely lifted. I have just seen a telegram from the Government of India from which it appears that it may have been re-imposed. (I am trying to get the full story from the E.&amp; 0.

It appears from our archives that beginning from November 29th, 1941, the hearing of the appeal has been postponed altogether six times. On four occasions because the Shaikh’s lawyer had an inadequate power of attorney, on one occasion because the Shaikh’s lawyer could not produce an essential document and once only (Sept ember 7th) on behalf of the defendant when his lawyer failed to appear. Prom the information available to me therefore 1 am dis posed to the view that the procrastination that has occurred is more properly attributable to the slackness of the Shaikh’s lawyers (see also paragraph 4 of Hickinbotham’s letter to you of August 3 0th ) than to any shortcomings of^ the Courts 5. As regards the Pao property (and hereagain, to judge frojfi the paragraph of Agent, Kuwait’s despatch to yo u H o. 1/829-5/2 of August 30th It seems that the Shalg:h T s’ -J lawyer was, to say the leasts singular ly c are le s s), the difficulty created by the first G say the Political Shaikh’s foreign nationality may not be so serious as Hickinbotham sugge ats. 6 . lou will recall that in the Iraqi Government’s note to His Majesty’s Government’s proposal that the problem of agreeing the Shaikh’s title to his properties in Iraq should be settled by recoursi to Land Settlement it was stipulated that the nationality of the Shaikh should constitute no impediment or delay to the completion of the registration of the properties which may be awarded to him in accordance with the Land Settlement Law. 7. prom Hickinbotham’s despatch of August 30th mentioned above it appears that the 10 th Land Settlement Board would normally register the reclaimed land of the Pao garden in the Shaikh’s name but may not do so because there is some law which precludes it from doing so on account of his foreign nationality. 8 . In order to judge how best to deal with this contingency, if it should arise, I should be glad if Hickinbotham would tell us moxe precisely what Law it is which he understands will influence the Land Settlement Boardls decision in this manner. He has evidently obtained his information from Good and Good is clearly the’ be st man to en^lighten him further on this point. 9 . I fear there is no chance of persuading the Iraqi ment to amend the Law to favour the Shaikh. It has been to settle his claims by Land Settlement and we are bound by the decisions given under the Land Settlement Law. 0.

It is quite correct that the earlier adjournments were applied for by the 3haiAh f s lawyers and that they did not act In as prompt and diligent a Banner as could have been desired* it is worth while noting that both these gentlemen, Haji 3uliman Fadhi in Basra and Kasarat al Farsi In Baghdad* were only briefed by His Highness after consul tation with the Kmb&amp;ssy in Baghdad In the case of the last named and the Consulate General in Basra In the case of the first narked, but it is our opponents who are now failing to appear in Court and being granted adjournments and the suspicion mentioned la paragraph 3 of nay demi offi cial letter ffo.3/S3Q dat ed Au gust th e 30th , not paragraph 4 as stated by Thompson is rapidly becom ing a certainty. 3* The negligence of the 3haii£h t s ex legal adviser Abdul Jaleel Bartu, now ! ayor of Basra, has nothing whatever to do with the question of what interpretation the Chainuaa of the 10th Land Bocrd may consider it his duty to put on the relevant sections of the law of Iraq regarding ownership of property by an alien. I do not anticipate that His Highness* non Iraqi nation ality will contribute any 'impediment or delay to the completion of the registration of the properties which may t.t; awarded to him/ Tiie Hon * ble U.

I that the Iraq Government have not informed the President of the 10th Land Board that this particular amendment does not apply in the case of the properties of the Shaikhs of Kohamorrah and Kuwait for as I have indicated in paragraph 4 of my letter No,C/829 of Au^ist 30th o rders were passed recently by him alienating certain areas of the late Shaikh of Lohamorrah estates which came v/ithin the category of reclaimed lands. I consider that this aspect of the problem should be put to H.B.K’s Embassy with all possible force and urgency and, should my contention prove on enquiry from Good by the Consul General Basra to be correct, they be asked to draw the Iraq Government’s attention to the undertaking of the 29th Parch 1941 and to insist on immediate instructions implementing that assurance being issued to the President of the 10th Land Board.

The hearing of the Paddaghiyah case fixed for 31st December was postponed until 20th January because the power of attorney of the lav/yer of the opposing side Was found to be defective in some way and on 20th January another adjournment was ordered by the Court in order that certain documents cited by the Counsel of the other side might be produced. The next hearing is fixed for 6 th February. It begins to look as though this case might drag on until circumstances, it is as you will recall from the Sheik’s lawyers .o not regard tnese repeated postponements as inimical to their distinguished client’s interests. the Creek Kalends.

(c•G^(z^(^^(cj^ On receiving your letter (E 6723/2515/93) of 21st November, I asked Holt to see Nasrat al Paris! and to enquire how the Paddaghiyah case now stands. 2. Nasrat al Paris! said that the frequent postponements .of the hearing of the appeal had been due in the main to technical difficulties about his power of attorney and other documents and to the occasional illnesses of the lawyers on one side or the other. He thought however that a judgment would be given at the hearing now fixed for December 31st. In his opinion the many postponements had not been prejudicial to the Shaikh’s interests, on the contrary v/hile there was life there was hope. He warned Holt that though there was no, doubt that the Shaikh had paid for the Paddaghiyah estate the purchase had, from the legal point of view, been made in an irregular and in some ways an illegal manner. He would do his best to win the case but he had from the beginning make it clear to the Shaikh’s lawyer who had briefed him that the chances of success were not good. 3. Holt asked him what could be done if the Court of Appeal (istinaf) decided in favour of the appellants and against the Shaikh. Nasrat al Paris! said that in the event it would be open to the Shaikh to take the case to the Court of Cassation (Tamiz). This court could only consider points of law but as nearly the whole of the pleading on each side had concerned points of law this limitation would not be important. He explained however that he could not himself on his existing instructions take the case to Cassation as he had been briefed only for the present appeal. Further action would therefore rest with the Shaikh and his lawyer Sulaiman Paidhi. 4. . Holt then enquired v/hether, in the event of the judgment in both the Court of Appeal and Cassation going against the Shaikh, His Highness would be able to claim the refund of the purchase money. Nasrat al Parisi replied that the Shaikh should certainly do so and added that as it seemed that the purchase money had been paid in Turkish gold liras the Shaikh would do very well if he got back the price originally paid for the property. He said that in his opinion o, claim for the refund of the purchase price should be made in the Basra Court at once if a final judgment were given against the Shaikh in thd Court of Cassation. He could not of course do this himself but it should be done by Sulaiman Paidhi, the Shaikh’s lawyer at Basra. Holt asked him, in conclusion, whether in the event of a final judgment being given against the Shaikh and of a claim then being lod.ged for tie .return of the purchase price, the Shaikh would be able to remain in possession until the sum in question had been refunded to him. Nasrat al Parisi was a little doubtful about this. He said that much would depend on the Basra Courts and the manner in which they were approached by the Shaikh’s lawyer there. He thought that it might be possible to devise a gambit whereby the Shaikh could be kept in possession of Paddaghiyah until the money paid for it was paid back to him but it was, in his view, by no means certain that the rival claimants would not secure a judgment awarding them the right of immediate occu] present app&lt; FMALQftUHI ^ - 2 1 (i JAN 1943 FROM SECRETARY EXTERNAL BfcPT., INDIA OFFICE Commission.

This being so we are all very much in the hands of the lawyers.

Holt ab ays that he gave Nasrat openings-to complain about the Judge if he had wished to do so, but no complaint was made and I have not heard-, of any intrigue against Shaikh t s interests except that of the rival claimants, v/nich of course lies behind the whole case; but that is not a Government but a family affair. 7. The case of the Shaikh’s title to the land reclaimed on the river front of his Pao property is still in the hands of the Land Settlement Committee at Basra before which the.Shaikh is presumably represented by his Basra lawyer and so-far Nasrat al Paris! has had nothing to do with it. ; e have sent you copies of the further correspondence which has passed between the Persian Gulf Residency and ourselves on this subject. 8 . The destruction in May 1941 of the bulk of the Embassy's archives is often a handicap in dealing with the complexities of the Shaikh of Koweit’s properties in Iran. Por example, I am told that in 1938 when the new Land Settlement Law was enacted a commentary on its provisions basedon expert opinion was sent from the Embassy to the Foreign Office. - There is now no copy of it in our archives but from our index it seems that it was probably contained in a letter from Morgan (then in charge here) to Baggallay No. 776/3/38 ot Larch 9th, 1908. I should be grateful if you could trace this and^ send us^ a copy. So many varied points arise about the application of this law to the Shaikh's properties and it would be useful to have this paper for reference. 9 .

We of course share your anxiety that the Sheikh should be given all possible help. This applies not only to the Bashiyah case, where the question of compensation will in all probability arise .nffrirthe judgement goes against him; but also to the Faddaghiyah case which, it appears, should have been settled in his favour months ago. Unfortunately our information about recent events is scanty; for instance, we have received a copy neither of the the $ both/'both of which are mentioned in the enclosures to t t your letter. But from paragraph 2 of Thonjbon s letter of October 3rd it appears that September 21st had been fixed for the date of the hearing of the Faddaghiyah appeal. We do not know when the Bashiyah appeal was to be heard, but the intention seems to have been to take ooth cases together. Hence it may well be that both of them have been heard by this time, and it would seem that the first question to ask the Embassy is whether this is so* and, if it is, what were the judgements• 7k We suggest, however^ that you might at^same time ask the Embassy, should there have been further delay, to get into touch with Nas^rat al Farisi with the object, firstly, of discovering whether he is doing his best and what his difficulties are; and, secondly, of stimulating him to overcome them. Nas^rat being in Baghdad, we/ 3TT3J . i G i'l I iOfli t •m 1 A (m we do not see how he can he tackled otherwise than through the Embassy; if, as Hickinbot\am says, both the Sheikhfe Agent and his Basrah attorney have been remarkably slack, it would be futile to CfJtirr^fyC to exert pressure on Nasarat through them. You will have noticed that k Hickinbot\am says that when he saw Good he received the impression that his suspicion that the Bench were not too anxious to hear the case might be well founded. Although we do not dispute Thonjfson’s contention that the procrastination which KaJ CCCUAlcl io aooorded-is largely attributable to the slackness of the Sheikh*s lawyers, it is surely only too probable that there are political influences at work against the Sheikh and that these^atfe^at least to some extent responsible for the delay. The anxiety shown by Yusuf al Kabeer to get rid of the case so soon after he had agreed to iv** represent the Sheikh may be suggested in this/this connection (see enclosures to Residents No.587-3 of June 16th). Perhaps you will ask the + Embassy to think again about this. Will you -please repeat any telegrain you may send to Baghdad on this subject to the Political Resident and to the Political Agent at Koweit.

I'] (S) T Dear Lumby, I send you herewith copies of correspondence between the political Resident and Thompson on the subject of the Sheikh of Koweit’s law-suits. It seems to emerge pretty clearly from this correspondence that the Sheikh’s interests are not being very efficiently represented, anyway judged by western standards. If the Sheikh loses any ct ^j; s f law-suits, he will, no doubt, appeal to His Majesty s Government for compensation and (subject perhaps to changes brought about by alteration of the course of the river) presumably His Majesty’s Government will have to give it to him (vide my letter to Wright of the Treasury F. 8412/456/93 of which a copy was senL to ybuT: rr Ofily for this reason, we feel that everything possible should be done to help you think that there is anything that we could usefully say to the Embassy? We do not suggest that the Sheikh would necessarily gain by changing lawyers at this stage - As the Oriental Counsellor told Sheikh Muhammad el Ahmad al Sebah in May, Nasarat al Farisi is one of the best lawyers in Bagdad (see enclosure m Residency endorsement No.587-S._Qf the l6th_June, 1942).

We met the Lawyer Yusuf al Kabeer at the appointed time and asked him to accept to be our Lawyer and we gave him the Power of Attorney and all the documents re uired for the cases^ in the Court of Appeal. He promised to call on us in our hotel at eight o’clock to discuss the matter with us. He came at eight o’clock and declared that he was Quite willing to be our Lawyer and he added that he was going to attend the Court to-morrow morning and ask the Court to give him all the documents in connection with the case and he told us to attend the Court at nine o’clock, before seeing the case by the Court. We went to the Court and met the' Lakyer who informed us that he was very sorry to say that he was unable to act as our Lawyer, as Fadayya’s case is a very difficult case and he is sick and so he does not see himself able to do so in spite of our inducing him. At last we asked him to appear in the Court, being our legal Lawyer according to the Power of Attorney he holds, and ask the Court to postpone the case. He agreed to that and attended the Court and asked them to postpone the case so that he may study the documents carefully. The Courts agreed to this and the two cases, i.e. Al-Fadhayya and Al-Bashya were postponed to 11th July, 1942. Yusuf al Kabeer told us frankly that his opinion was that it would be better for us to appoint the Lawyer Nasrat al Fares!, as he is a very capable person and a notable personality as he was minister for sometime. Le, according to your order, could not speak to anybody before consulting the British Embassy, so we went to the Embassy and had an interview with Major Holt and we explained the matter to him and told him that the Lawyer Yusuf al Kabeer was not willing to act as our Lawyer, because his health does not help him to take up such a difficult case and he, being our legal Lawyer, agreed to ask the Court to postpone the case and that he, Yusuf al Kabeer, ad vised us to appoint the Lawyer Nasrat al Fares!, and that we have orders from His Highness the father, to appoint no any other Lawyer besides Yusuf al Kabeer, unless we consult you first We asked him if he agress upon the appointment of the Ls.?/yer Nasrat al Fares!. He said, yes, I do agree to appoint the Lawyer Nasrat al Fares!. ’ So we wished him goodbye and went to meet the Lawyer Nasrat al Fares!, but we did not see him that time. On the second day we met him and asked him if he was pre pared to be our Lawyer. He agreed in the beginning provided that there would be no legal obstacles in his way. He said, ’’Sulaiman Shawaf had 'sometime back, asked me to communicate with the Ministry of Finance regarding the declaration of the Settlement at Fao and I don’t remember whether I referred to the Ministry of Finance or not”. He asked us to £ee him to morrow morning and so we went to him on the next day and reached an agreement regarding his charges which are to be ID.150/-. He told us that he was not prepared to accept neither money nor the documents, being afraid that he had any reference to this case, but he was going to study the case carefully and will let us know of the rewult on the 9th June, when he will have finished studying the case. I, therefore, wrote a letter to Major Holt explaining to him how far we went with the case as you can make out from the enclosure.^5 , o) Copy of letter dated th'l' , S7t|i May, 194:2, '^□^“Kolt 1 Ahmed al Jattir as-Subah, B&amp;ghdad, to Majoi Holt, Mohammed al Ahmed al Jat Baghdad• I beg to inform you that; 1 find it c I ult &lt;?, ^^fter let Your Excellency knoifj. the result oft the l r ^ned to my last interview with you.

With reference to your telegram Ho. 903 of May cOth, I have the honour to inform you that Shaikh Muhammad al Ahmad al ^ Sabah called on the Oriental Counsellor on the morning of Maj 35th together with his lawyer Sulaiman Faidhi. 2. He explained that Yusuf al Kabir had declined the brief offered to him but had agreed to go into Court to ask xor a further adjournment on the grounds that time was necessary^to enable the Sabah family to find a lawyer to take the place of Partu. 3. Shaikh Muhammad enquired whether Nasrat al Farisi would be a good choice and the Oriental Counsellor said that Nasrat al Farisi was certainly one of the best lawyers in Baghdad. Shaikh Muhammad then went away to the Court with Sulaiman Faidhi. 4 .

Partu will confirm after he returns from Baghdad at beginning of January. Date of hearing of appeal February 7th. FADDAGHIYAH . On November 29th appellate court noted that Shaikh had not been ? served and gave February 7th as new date for hearing. Case against Shaikh is that when Dobbs ordered registration in name of Mubarak and estate was duly registered Aysha Zair grandmother (mut.) Abdulla Zair appellant through Suliman Shav/af attorney was not present. Also on grounds that court of cassation from whence case was transferred to land Board has not yet given decision. 7 fsfoutL ?

One Habbaba has petitioned Land Board against this decision and his case will be heard January 8th.- 2 ~ I * 3. Fartu considers chance of an appeal by Shaikh succeeding in Bashiyeh case very flimsy but as appeal is being heard on same day as Faddagiyah considers it oetter for appeal to be lodged as little extra ? expense will be caused and Shaikh v/ill be satisfied that ?everything possible has been done. In view of changed circumstances • sinc e my despatch !To.C/545 October 4th I suggest Shaikh be advised to lodge an appeal. 4.

I have been informed that heirs of Shafitiah have no property (see British Consulate Basra letter mut.) as I have already pointed out and ? presumably no action can be taken until after hearing of appeal on February 7th ^ my suggestion that Shaikh should ? appeal is agreed to. In the meantime I will make further enquiries regarding 1 financial position of heirs of Shafiqah. 6.

So far as I am aware according to usual practice Court will issue fresh summonses for new hearing and old summonses cannot be used for date other than that mentioned in them. It is necessary however that old summonses should be returned to Court in order that it may be aware that they were not served before the date for which they were issued. It is doubtful whether Court will issue fresh summonses until old summonses have been returned, as if latter had been served in time the Subah would be liable to ex carte proceedings and no further summonses would be necessary. Old summonses should in my opinion be returned through source from which they were received with a communication regretting that it was not found possible to serve them before the date fixed and asking that any further summonses should be served direct on Partu. As they were received through official sources it does not seem proper to return them privately through P^rtu.

The despatch from the Foreign Office to Bagdad to which the Political Resident refers (see our official letter E 2198/18/93 to you of the 27th April, 1936) was written before we put forward our proposals for a comprehensive settlement. In it we said - (a) that the argument that the Iraqi courts were not entitled to entertain actions relating to land in Iraq when the defendant is a foreign sovereign, did not hold water, but (b) that since we were under an obligation to safeguard the Sheikh^ possessions, we were not going to make things easier for the other side by serving documents on the Sheikh through the diplomatic channel: the Iraqis were in our view failing to fulfil their obligations to ensure fulfilment of our promises to the Sheikhs and if the Sheiks v/ere dispossessed in actions His Majesty’s Government would claim compensation from the Iraqi Government. That was in April, 1936. In July, 1936, we made our comprehensive proposals, under which we offered to accept the decisions of the Land Settlement officer and any modifications which might result from subsequent/ -8DE€'| INDIA C 'PICE R.T• peel, Lsq., G.B.L., M.G.V subsequent appeals to the special court provided for in the Land Settlement law (see our official letter ' E 4766/18/93 to you of the 5th August, 1936). When, in 1938, the Iraqi Government replied that thev were ’'disposed to accept' our proposals, they pointed out moer alia that all judgments of the special court are subject to appeal to the Court of Cassation on points of law, and we answered accepting the terms expressed in the third paragraph of the telegram from Cornwallis are right, and that partu should be empov/ered to accept summonses on the Sheikh, just as summonses can be served on the representatives of the other persons concerned. The Sheikh may of course lose on appeal some of the properties av/arded to him by the Land Settlement Officer, but that is obviously a risk inherent in our 1936 offer. What we shall do if he does (and what we shall do if he does not appeal with success against the decision of the Land Settlement Cfiicer over the Bashiyah estate) will be a matter for settlement betv/een him and His Majesty’s Government. In the 1936 proposals it was expressly stipulated that we would not in such circumstances make any claim against the Iraqi Government. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hardie at the Treasury. of their reply (see correspondence enclosed in our official letter E 6676/28/93 to you of the 25th November, 1938. ) It seems to us, therefore, that the viewsFILE COPY ff^.U &gt;y.

My own feeling is that position has entirely changed since Foreign Office despatch to which Political Resident refers was written, and that having agreed to land settlement procedure, His Majesty’s Government cannot now obstruct this procedure by refusing to serve on the Sheik summonses which are made in accordance with land settlement law. On the other hand there would seem to be no objection to service of summonses on legal representatives of persons concerned provided these representatives are in possession of powers of attorney which would be necessary to make such service legal.

POREIGII OFFICE, S • W • 1 • 3rd April, 1940. 3ir # I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad regarding the application of land settlement in the Fao Nahiyah, in which are situated the most valuable of the properties in Iraq belonging to the family of the Sheikh of Howeit. 2* Ine earlier history of the pledge given by His Majesty’s Government in 1914 to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Hohammerah, by which they were promised tax-free possession of their private estates in Ottoman territory, will be known to Hr. MacDonald. I am, however, to explain that in order to secure a comprehensive settlement of this difficult question. His Majesty's Government informed the Iraqi Government in 1936 that, provided that the latter would for their part give a formal undertaking to make no claim for arrears of (direct) taxation against either Sheikh in respect of their properties in Iraq and would provide a formal assurance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed upon the properties of either in future. His Majesty's Government were prepared to make no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of / the ‘Phe Under-Secretary of State, - Colonial Office.* the properties of the two Sheikhs from taxation in Iraq. At the same time it was proposed that all uncertainties as to the boundaries of the properties in question should be removed through the application, by a British official, of the Iraqi land settlement procedureo It was added that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to abide by the decisions of the land settlement officer as to the boundaries of the lands in question and by any modifications of these decisions which might result from subsequent appeals to the special court provided for by the law, and that they were further prepared to undertake not to make any claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of any changes which might result to the present boundaries of the Sheikhs* lands in consequence of the land settlement procedure. 3. These proposals were accepted, with certain unimportant modifications, by the Iraqi Government in 1933. In consequence His Majesty’s Government are now proposing to pay compensation amounting in all to between £45,000 and £50,000 to the families of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah for the losses which they have suffered in respect of the new system of indirect taxation imposed by the Iraqi Government in 1932, and it is naturally most desirable that His Majesty’s Government should not be faced with any further claims for compensation from those familieso The boundaries of the estates of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah have not hitherto been disputed, but there have been a number of disputes regarding the estates of the Sheikh of Koweit* In particular the validity of his title to the most valuable of the estates has been / challenged01 i , challenged by the heirs of the original vendor. It is therefore important that the land settlement operations should he carried out by a competent and reliable official. 4» It will be seen from Mr* Houstoun-Boswall * s despatch that none of the British personnel at present in Iraq, are available for this work, and that the Iraqi Government are anxious to secure the return of Mr« R. P. Jardine, a former official of the Iraqi Government who is now in the service of the Government of Palestine c In the circumstances Lord Halifax would be most grateful if the necessary arrangements might be made by the Government of Palestine for the secondment of Hr« Jardine.. His Lordship is satisfied that the work to be entrusted to him in Iraq would be of real importance from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government * 5® Lord Halifax understands that it is estimated that the work of land settlement for the whole Nahiyah of Fao will take between one year and eighteen months.

On February 13th Sir Basil Newton informed Saiyid All Jaudat, then Minister for Foreign Affnirs, tin t he had heprd thet it was intended to appoint an Iraqi Lend Settlement Officer to work on the Fao Nahiyeh end reminded him that under the terras of Mr* B8tem?in f 8 letter of July 8th, 1936 and of Taufiq Suwaidl’a reply of October 30th, 1938 it was necessary that a British Officer should be appointed to do this work* Saiyid All Jaudat did not dispute this contention and undertook to find out the frets# 3# Some days later Gazette No* 1773 was issued containing a notification of the appointment of Salyld Arif el Arif to be Land Settlement Officer in the Fao Nahiyah# 4# At the first op ortunity after the fonaation of the new Government Sir Basil Newton took up the .atter with the Prime Minister. Nuri Said assured him that orders had been given for Saiyid Arif al Arif's appointment to bs cancelled but he added thrt though he agreed that a British Officer was necessary he feared that it would be hard to find one as the two latest recruits to che department were too inexperienced/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K# G* , G* C* J# !• , G*C*X#i*, etc., etc*, etc*,Inexperienced to work independently end the three other British Lend Settlement Officers were already fully occupied* 5« Nuri Pasha went on to speck with regret of the failure of the effort that he had made last summer to persuade Ur* R*P* Jardine to come back to Iraq* and asked whether His Majesty^ Qovernnient could not arrange to send Mr* Jardine back if only to carry out the settlement work in the Fao Nahiyeh* 6* It is of considerable importance that a final solution of the whole question of the title of the Shaikh of Koweit to his properties in Iraq should be reached as soon as possible and it would seem to be in the interests of His Majesty's Goyemiaent th? t Mr* Jardine's services should be made available for this work either by secondment or in some other way* Hot only is no other officer at present available but Mr, Jardine is himself particularly well qualified to carry out this work by his past experience and detailed knowledge of local conditions in the Basra llwa* 7* In these circumstances I venture to recommend that the possibility of satisfying the Prime Minister's desire that Mr* Jardine should return for a period to work as a Land Settlement Officer in Iraq should be sympathetically examined* 8* I understand from the aemi-official correspondence that passed last summer between my Chancery and the Secretariat of the High Oommissioner in Palestine that subject to the consent of the Secretary of State for the Colonies the Palestine Government would be willing to release Mr* Jardine for service in this country and if his personal interests were safeguarded and the importance of the work from the point of view of His Majesty's Government were explained to him* Mr* Jardine himself might be willing to undertake to come to IraqSI at least for long enough to carry out settlement operations in the Fao Nahiyah. 9# As regards the stipulation contained in paragraph 6 (a) of Mr. Bateiaan's letter of July 8th 1936 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and paragraph 3 of Selyid Taufiq Suwaid^s reply of October 30th t 1938 f I enclose herein a translation of the relevant portions of Law No* 3 of 1940 which provide for the cancellation of all the outstanding land tax assessments of the Shaikhs of Koweit and Muhammerah* 10* X am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Palestine at Jerusalem to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Koweit* I have the honour, etc*, (Sgd* ) W.£.

I learn privately that the position is at present as follows&gt; When application was made for the appeal to be considered under Article 7 (ll) of the Courts Proclamation of December, 1917, and the necessary fees (£200) were paid (our telegrams to the Foreign Office Nos. 185 and 200), the President of the Court of Cassation sent instructions to Basra for the other side to be served with notification of this application. Up to Wednesday, May 3lst, this had not been done but efforts are being made to hasten process. eight days in which to reply before further action can be taken by the Court. Meanwhile, a determined movement is apparently being started in the Court of Cassation against the thesis that the ordinary courts are barred altogether from hearing cases concerning land in an area declared a Land Settlement Area. This is serious because it has all along been hoped that if the appeal could be brought before the Court (Land Settlement having been declared in the Fao Nahiyah in which the Faddaghiyah property is situated) the Court would pass it to Land Settlement and execution of the judgement against the Shaikh of Kov/eit given in the Basra Court of First Instance last summer would be prevented. The new theory which is being developed will, if adopted, also upset our idea that new cases cannot be brought in the Court of First Instance concerning land in a Settlement Area, though it seems doubtful whether it can in fact be carried thus far. very uncertain, and there are Judges who are working hard to find reasons for not passing the case to Land Settlement. There is, I gather, a similar case before the Court and much depends on how that goes.

ENCLOSURE IN BAGDAD DESPATCH No. 126 DATED 25th MARCH 1939 British Embassy, Bagdad, 25th March, 1939. Your Excellency, As I had the honour to inform His Majesty King Ghazi in Your Excellency^ presence on March 23rd, information has reached me that the local authorities in the Basra Liwa sent on March 19th a printed communication to the agent of the Shaikh of Koweit demanding the payment within ten days of ID.19,480/900 on account of unpaid taxes and stating that in default of payment v/ithin this period his immovable property would be attached. Following this, on March 22nd, the Mudir of Fao attached the Shaikh’s property at Faddaghiyah, evicted all the cultivators and replaced them by others. 2 . I have no detailed information of the nature of the unpaid taxes in question, since none is given in the printed form mentioned above, but there seems little doubt that the sum claimed represents the total revenue assessments of the Shaikh’s properties in Iraq up to the time of the institution of the ’Istihlak’ tax system. 3. Your Excellency is aware that my Government have always maintained the right to claim that the properties of the Shaikh of Koweit in Iraq should be exempted from taxation and that, in Mr. Bateman’s note No. 347 of July 8 th, 1936, it was proposed, by way of final settlement of this question, that no frther claim for the exemption of these properties from taxation should be made, provided that the Iraqi Government would, for their part, give a final undertaking to make no claim His Excellency Saiyid Nuri al Said, G.M.G., D.S.O., Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad.(§&gt;) .*&gt; claim for arrears of taxation in res'pect of these properties. 4 . This proposal v/as accepted 'by His Excellency Saiyid Taufiq. al Suwaidi in his letter to Sir Maurice Peterson, No. 14184/2440/100 of Octoher 30th, 1938. Your Excellency will therefore understand my astonishment at the present inexplicable action of the local authorities in Basra. 6 . I feel sure that Your Excellency will agree that it is essential that instructions should be issued at once cancelling the action taken by the Mudir of Fao and v/ithdrawing the revenue demand which has been addressed to the Shaikh 1 s agent, and I hope that I may receive an early intimation that this has been done.

V 7 a 8 writ ton in the future ten 30 arul it was, therefore, considered that a surety bond was not present, that the memo, of appeal was devoid of tine necessary condition and for this reason it was rejected, ns the/para of article 186 of the Civil procedure naw declares that if the appeal period has not yet expired, the unfulfilled requirements can be completed and, that should there bo necessity fox 1 the preparation of fresh application, the appellant is entitled to do so. In view of this clear legal statement and the comment od this article by Ustad may id baud Samra, who said, 'A decision was passed by trie Court of Revision at Constantinople on 14/11/318 allowing to completion of the Surety Bond during the rest of the period of oO days commencing from the date of the announcement of the order in respect of the rejection of the application, and the Iraqi Appeal Court upheld this opinion in several decisions of theirs; thus the unfulfilled conditions were completed within the remaining period Tt # the decision passed on 14/ll/ol8 was in connection with a case which was exactly identical with this one las can be seen from the copy of order attached), the Court of Revision considered that the Heviaional Curety bond was not in existence and your honourable Court held the same view in this case too# as I prepared a fresh burety bond in which the surety undertook to accpet liability for all losses, damages, necessary expense*, travelling expenses, Respondent when my clients have been found unjustified in their appeal &gt; I request that a day for hearing may be the Respondent bo summoned, an order be passed reversing judgement appealed from^the case of the plaintiff ( the Respondent) be rejected and he be made to bear all Court fees, Advocate fees for conducting the litigation before the Courts of ’/l st ^stance anu appeal and fees for the lust fees and Court fees which might be sustained by the■I 0 1 -5. the preparation of this petition for the following reasons:- (1) ;.,y client - the appellant - is the Chief of un iiairate ^the Mu irate of xuiwait Independent in all her affairs frora and the Government of Iraq has no sovereignty over it. in view of the general Xxitomational Law the ordinary Courts have no jurisdiction to try any head of Government or pass a judgement against hiou This is supported by the views of all lawmakers. The Cyclopedia of Laglish and Imperial naws states (as translated/ as follows in this Connection;- f, It is not permissible to try Governments and their heads before the Courts us that goes against the sense and principles of the International ~aw. Ho exceptions are to be made to this except in 2 cases, i.e. when Goarernmente or their heads enter into litigations before the Courts as parties to a case, the defendant is empowered to submit a demand to them; and, if such a Government or its head owns properties in the hands of a third person, they can be tried with this :&gt;er8on. This also applies to Headsof -.rotooted states and Listricts f ds it does to kings .” Tart 1.4305 sub- para: 404 and 405 of the s ad authority. There are other view and decisions to this effect which I mentioned in my petitions to the Court of First Instance. The Respondent agreed with me on this point and showed his readiness to except His Highness Gheikh ^hmad al-Jabir as-mubah from the case whereas the international iwgreement to which I referred, as can be seen by your honourable Court in para 2 of this petition, ia an agreement concluded with Shaikh Mubarak as Subah, the bequeather of the appellants, which contains a provision making it applicable to him and to hia heirs. The acceptance of the Hasrah Court of First Inst fine e of a case against the head of an inde/(p undent Govemment in spite of his objection to it, is contrary to Law and its judgement is liable to be reversed.(S) The hearirit? of the case, the judgement whereof has been appealed froti, ia outsiae the jariediction of the Court as the British Goverajuent, on 3/11/1914, concluded a treaty with Bhaiich Mubarak as odbah, the bequeather of the appellants contain/a clear unci 9 r , talcing by the British Government to protect the properties of shaikh Mubarak as Bub ah and his successors in Iraq which were under their follows wo d by words* Moreover, you demanded certain promises concei*ning your good seif from the Hi^h Government, under your control; tne date garcens situated betv/een Ifao ana ^urna will remain undei* your and youi 1 successors’ control* 1 submitted a certified copy of this text to the Court of First Instance. Therefore, the High British Government is the guarantor of the ikuirate of Kuwait and particularly of the family of His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait, Mubarak as 3ubah t his sons end grandsons in respect of their properties situated in the Vilayut of Basra, according to the terms of General International -aw, the guaranteeing Government has right to interfere if any other Government, through its legal authorities, attempts to touch that which the Government has guaranteed* if we admit this, the dispute in this case would then, In fact, be between Great Britain and the Government of Iraq, which may be considered as having power to protect the rights of her subjects who live under her aegis. If we say so, it would be neo#saary for us to refer to the Treaties which settled matters between Britain and Iraqi Gn 30/7/30 a treaty was concluded between the British Government and Iraq. The Iraqi Govemmant, at article 9 of the Treaty, undertook not to injure the existing undertakings and previl4ges, which may exists in respect of the British Government, provided such disposal when the said treaty was ratifies, it is as namely (1/ { ) which is at present — —undertakings not oppose tne Covenant 03 the ^eagu© of Notions or tne ireaty for the Prevention of ^ar eignen at Paris. This is the text of -^rtioie s# in question. ^This Treaty cio 3 not contain anything which bright 9 in niiy way $ injure the existing rights and undertakings or ti.ose that may exist for or against any of the two Contracting Parties in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaty for the Prevention of War signed at Paris on 27/8/ iis the proper ties, for the cancellation of whose documents a case h&amp;cv been filed, were in my clients possession on the date of the ratification of the Treaty, as admitted by the Respondent himself, it is undoubtedly one of the undertakings given by Britain to someone else prior to the ratification of tne ireaty Ox alliance t*&gt; j.- • •' -• Iraq and Britain as also it ia one of the undertakings which Iraq undortooK not to injure, as the Iraqi Treaty is a law which the Iraqi Courts should act upon. It may be said that the present case is in connection with a private property in Basra owned by H.K.k,haiKh nhiuad as ouban, the ^mir of Kuwait, in his private capacity. This statement is incorrect, as H.H.The ohnikh of Kuwait is the Heed a ntate. should he go to another ctete and own property there, his official designation ctuinot detach from him. On the other hand, the undertaking of Britain to the Head of the Kuwait Btate in regard to his properties in Baarah cannot be regarded as an ordinary matter, but it is purely an international matter. Thenefore, to disregard this defence and to hear the case in spite of the existence of this undertaking binding the Goveriiment and people of Iraq is against law ana should be cancelled. -article 10 of the -vnglo-lraqi Treaty clearly says as follows. ’Bhould any misunderstanding take placein regard to its application or interpretation and the two Contracting Parties have not beon able to arrive at a settlement between themselves by direct negotiation, the difference is to be dealt with in accordance with the terns of the Covenant of the ^eague of hations .* No doubt, in view of the adherence to this defence of ray clients who are the Heads and i&gt; embers of the Ruling Family of a Foreign ^t&amp;te, it is incumbent on the ordinary Courts to desist from settling the dispute in the ordinary way, and should ask those concerned to approach the Iraqi Government for addressing the Chief of the Kuwait ^-tate or the British Government in a diplomatic way. Therefore, to disregard this point ana to proceed with the case in the ordinary manner is contrary to law and should be cancelled* (4) This case is to be rejected for another reason,i,e* 9 the properties in dispute belong to the appellants - my client and have been under their control since lb years and more, with which they have been dealing without any objection. This their disposal is based on formal Tapu Document issued from a competent authority and by the order of a competent official The plaintiff - Abdullah an Kuhuir hinself was present in Basrah all that time and was witnessing the appellants d©*ling witn these properties. ,JLso his bequeatheress, who is sale to be the owner of these properties had numerous agents, some out of whu^ were lawyers licenced to practise, ana others w re distinguished personalities who exercised influence in this country. The beqaeatheress actually filed a number of cases in the nasra courts and was represented by a number of lawyers on the strength of general powers of attorney* Che was not in an isolated town distant from Iraq ana she was quite aware that m cli nts - the appellants - were disposing these properties freely. Moreover, she die not advance any olaira until the time of her death. Therefore, filing of a case- J- after the expiry of the recognized period of limitation, is contrary to the terms of ivrticle 1660 of al I s jallah Code, The reply given by plaintiff’s agent - the present Respondent - on this point vras (1) that 'There was an admission by me- that the^e properties were owned by nwwashah az * ahair. ’ TMs is against fact. If your Honourable Court exatiinen all ny plaints and petitions, they v/oulo not come across any achaisalon in respect of the ownership of those properties by Ayeshah az .^uhair. I believe that the respond out wants to obtain such an admission out of my statement that my clients owned these properties in a legitimate way from the bequeathereas of the plaintiff many years prior to the expiry of the period of limitation. The cifferanoe between the tvfo versions is not indistinct, article 1674 of majailah Code, on which the Respondent relied, is clear and goes ag-inst his contention. The admission that invalidates the lira! tat ion, in view of the sa± clarity of the article in question, is the admission regarding existence of rights for the plaintiff against the defendant at the time of ai mission. This is the text of -.a-tida 1074 in question. Jo clni: will drop by reasons of limitation* Therefore, if the defendant makes a clear admission before the Judge that he owed the plaintiff at that time in a ti .e-barred case, as claimed by the plaintiff, the time limitation is not to be considered, and judgment is to ba given on the admission of the defendant.' The Commentators of the hajaliah considered this a precautioner binding. The late aelim nazqi, who made comments on the : ajaliah, oaid as follows. 'The phrase *at present’ is a precautionary binding and is construed to mean that the admission of the defendant uoeo not invalidate the limitation of time unless he admitted his indebtedness until the present time. For instance, if one claims property from another saying that he owned it or inherited it from his father andthe defendant replied that he bought it from hislplaintiff f ») father and uncle from whom he^plaintiffj inherited such and. such thing , aiid that the property hue been in his(def*ndant * s) possession since 40 year's, it needs no proof. r ’ He further said, «If he (defendant) did not admit the property at thrt tine, his admission does not invalidate time limitation* ho one of us made any confession to the Respondent or to the bequeather of the insane, who is under his guardianship, regarding the existence oj any right xd anybody to these properties* The whole of my defence Is a totax denial of any right v?hioh the plaintiff claims to these properties which were registered and owned by my clients who have been disposing of them freely and without any hindrance for a period more than the recognized perioc of limitation. Then where is the admission on which the Respondent relies? ^2) That his client was absent and that the absence debars tine 1H station. This atatament is to be rejected too. The absence that debars ti^e limitation under article 1603 and 1664 of Al Majallah Coae is the absence which does not enable the absentee to claim his right through an attorney, such as being in oonfinment or in a place having no menus of communication with the place at which the case is to be filed or confined in a quarantine on account of epidemics etcetera. This is clear from Article 1663 of iil SUajaliah Rode* The said article quoted various decisions about minors and absentees. It is said that time limitation does not apply to minors at all and more definitely declared that time limitation is not applicable to minors whether they have guardians or not, but in the case of the absentees, it is legally applicable to their representatives. The object of these two different rulings is that the case of an absentee is different from tthat of disability. In the case of disability it makes no difference whether there is a representative or not, but in the case of an absentee, the existence of on attorney, who may either beappointed by the absentee or the Judge, the tiae liiaitfttiori is applioable* This is the view of the jurisprudent a. Besides that, cay Ida nyesha az ^uhair whom, the Respondent alleg es ’that the right ourae to hi:a through her”, had access to her properties in Basra ana haa muaeraus foi^al attorueyB there who held general and legal powers of attorney fro;n her, and she had filed several cases in Basra through thOEi. Therefore, the action of the oourt by dlsrogardlng the above and issuing an order for the cancellation of the Tapu locuiaents on the authority of the alleged admiasion, is eguinst law and should be set aaide. { 5 ) jxa regards the content ion of the nespodent tiiat defence about time limitation in respect of a Royal Boeument Uanad i^iaqaniiis not to be heard. He could not substantiate this opinion by quoting any provision of law. article IboG of ^1 Hajailah Code clearly defines that oases about properties, estates ana inheritances cannot be entertained after 15 years. We have no other law amending this article. This article is in general terms and stands as it ia. It is incredible that your honourable* court shoulc pass such an order which is contrary to law. The agent of the Respondent mentioned this point and alxeged that many Bisiilar dec^Ui^ons wore passed by your court but he neither produced nos/ a reference to any such decision. The only decision which he produced was one issued in base Ro. ?//- shaikh x.hiuac* al Jabir as-5ubah versus ^afia’h bint *.11 Pasha az Buht-ir. The decision in que&amp;tion was pas.ed in a case quite different from this one, as my clients' disposal of the properties in dispute i*.* thin case is based on a fapu document issued from an official department ana by a responsible official gs far aa his duties were concerned, lore than the limitation period has passed since my clients have been disposing of a y\ •fcM « mfinner• Ho formal doounont wasprodtiood in Case No.77 of l^oO reforrtjd to ebova except a sale deed executed outside the Tapu Ne vurtuont, ana no question was raised regarding possession by litaitation period. One of the oases, Noe.70/1921, 119 and 155, was between partners. Your honourable Court decided at that tiiue that disposal by a partner is not subject to limitation. This case i8,howevar, quite different fror:. that one. The other two decisions were to the effect that no personal evidence is to be heard for the cancellation of formal documents. I did not ask for personal proof of my clients 1 disposal of this property, but my defence is supported by a Tapu document reoogized by ray ap^onent. »'here is the resemblance between the two cases? It would, therefore, appear to your honourable Court that the Kespondent wants to benefit from judgments passed by your Court in cases quite unlike this one. This is not admissible. On the contrary I have come across several decisions passed by your honourable Court accepting defence on a question involving time limitation dm respect of disposal of an inmovable property registered in a document. One of the decisions in question . is the one issued under No.251/1925 ana published in nl hajallah al *xdliyah (j-aw Gaiette), Part IIII, 2nd Year, page 10, which runs ns follows:- 'Ho defence about disposal after the period of limitation will be heard in respect of property registered in a reliable document unless defence about the expiry of the period of limitation depends on any of the authorities of ownership on the strength of a written document.” Is there any written document more authentic than a sannd issued by an official aepartment? another decision issued in Case No.597/1956 and published in Parts o u. 4 of the Law Gazette, 2nd Year, is as follows:- 'If tae plaintiff fileu a cleim asking that thefSo'i 14^1 — lo ci ©fend ant b« prevented from raising any objection in respect of a house belonging to her and admitted that he had t&amp;kan it frota her by force 18 years ago and included it in his own house, it is necessary that her case should be rejected, as this period is above the period of limitation.' There are other decisions which we need not quote as they are better known to your honourable Court. It woulc, therefore, appear to your court that the defence of the Respondent which was heard by the Court of i^irst Instance, is against law end should be set aside. (6) The case, as defined by article 161o of a! ilajallah, is a claim submitted by one person against another, -her© should exist a condition that the thing claimed is a right of the claimant. The plaintiff in this case entangled hia case with the estate of .^yesha az Zuh&amp;ir which was transferred to the plaintiff, Abdullah az ..uhair, without the existence of any right of a olai.a to these properties as, according to the Ohara* division, ^.yesha died on 21/10/1901 and the plaintiff - the Respondent - admits that we have been possessing these properties Since 15th august 1915 on the authority of the documents produced. Th© right of putting a claim is, therefore, quashed. Ayesha az ^uhair was alive and her estate was transferred to the plaintiff. Therefore, the right of putting u claim did not exist in respect of this estate. The result is that this case was filed by a person not ©ntitled to do so legally. The action of the Court of First Instance in disregarding this point and passing an order nullifying the Tapu documents, is against law and should be set aside. (7) If we took it for granted that the appellate Court, in other cases, nullifies documents in respect of immovable properties executed outside the Tapu Department, those findings, according to principle, cannot fona a basis for judgment in this case. If we leave judgments of theAppellate Court aside and refer to the ^aw applied in this Country we do not find a single Law annulling sale deeds executed outside the Tapu Department. All what is there, as is evident from certain Appellate Opart decisions, is that they relied on Article 1 of the Law Concerning disposal of iiumov&amp;ble irouerties. If we were to examine this Article carefully, we would not find it to apply to pure properties, but it concerns State and aqf lands only. The sentence, 'And as disposal without a document is not admissible, so the hearing is not admissible too etc.*,’ may be interpreted to concern disposal of pure properties, but this interpretation is wrong, as the disposal to which this article refers is ’defined disposal* which was referred to above,i.e., btate and *aqf lands, boma decisions are based on the High Decree ^Iradah;issued on 10th September 1P1B. I searched tfor a text of this Decree but could not get it. I, however, got a copy of the instructions issued by the Ministry of Interior to the '/ilayats putting this Decree into operation. On going through it # I found that it did not annul deeds but it prevents hearing of cases. No doubt there is a great difference between hearing of a case and annulment of deeds, as we were not claimants in this case, the provisions of this Decree are not applicable to us as they have no legal strength, if we admit this point and take up the question of how my clients posaasbed and dealt with these properties, we will finu that they owned them by a legal and authentic deed dated 21st kuharrsm 1S27 given by the Agent-General authorised to execute the said deed on the authority of a genuine and formal power of attorney. «e will also find that he was approached in due course about the registration of the property in the Tapu Department and the Ministry approved the registration as can be seen from the letter of the Vali of dasraii Vilay&amp;t submitted with the papers of i'irst Instance case. &amp;hiie arrangenefcts were being made for the registration, Basrah was occupied by the British Forces and the Controller of inance of the Expeditionary ’orce issued orders for the registration of the property inquestion in the Tapu records, which wnn doiie. Ko doubt the Britiah Goverruiiant, when occupjriug Jasi’nh, was an invad ing Goyernaent entitled to organize the affairs in the territories that fell under their control according to their cwn desirer,. The General Officer Commanding the expeditionary Forces issued a circular in August 191S titled '’Law for the Occupied Territory o'‘ Iraq”, Part 6, item 47 of this Law, under the heading 'Miscellaneous Items”, is as follows:- 'Courts established under this Law do not apply the Ottoman renal ana Civil Procedure Codes end what relates to statements of law'. In view of this, the officials of the expeditionary Force were not using their power according to law but were acting on instructions received from the General Officer Ccxamandlng or his representative. The Tapu officials in dasrah received written instructions from the Finance Officer (oir Henry Lobbs) to register these properties in the naiae df the sons of Ills Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait which was done. This act of Sir Henry Dobbs is a legal one at that time aa a declaration was issued confirming similar acts performed by Sir Henry Dobbs. The declaration in question is ftio.32 dated June 1919, and from its text it would bo implied that prior to Its promulgation, this duty was performed by the said Controller of Finance. The formalities under which the properties were registered in the name of my clients do not differ from registration of sale deeds executed when the Tapu Departments were doted on account the occupation, anc such formalities were considered by the said declaration of 1919 and Law made by the Iraqi Government in 1^S2 aa proper and the properties have to be registered in the Tapu Department without the presence of the parties but simply on the attestation of the Political Officer. It would appear to your honourable Court that sale needs executed outside the Tapu Department are not null and void but, as said by the Egyptian Court of Kevision, would reraaixi as tney are until after registration and would not concern anyone not a party to the transaction, ^f for parties.they are considered to be genuine and valiu deeds like other genuine deeds. (8) The Tapu doouiaents which are in my clients 1 possession were issued under the written order of the Controller of finance (iiir henry hobbs)during the tUlifcaVy occupation of Basara by the British. No doubt the officials of the invading Government carried out their duties properly. The authors agreed to the genuinness of the functions of the conquering power. Ustad Ahnad Haaha’t Bey, ^awmaster in the naw school of Bgypt, states in his Book ’hisalat-al-Ithbat 1 as followas* H lf the legitimate Government was overpowered and the conquering power appointed an official, the written instructions of such an official are considered to be legal as he is in fact an official*. If we say that his actions are illegitimate, this would cause the public interests to be delayed and the works stopped, as there is no one else to perform the duties. If they wrote documents containing civil rights for or against the public, they should be accepted. - ho doubt it is in the public and special interest that such papers ana documents be regarded as official.* According to the ohara* of xxa&amp;cx Islam, judgments passed by a v adhi appointed by a conquering power are acceptable. This opinion is also uphelc by the Angiish author, Gooanow in his book *Contemporary Law of administration* , Part 2, page 2b, under the Heading 'Office Defects*. (9) This case is also subject to Indian Limitation Act. The Tapu documents on the authority of which ay clients have been dealing with the said properties, were given to then under Order Ko.504 of 14th June 1915 from the Inspector of yinanoe(Sir Henry Dobbsiwho was acting for the General Officer Commanding in the administration of the Finance of the country. The Tapu Department was one of the departments unaer his purview. Therefore, the order passed by Lir Henry Dobbs is an order passed by a¥ r / 2446 ’oompetent Govermaeut servant as far as hig‘ , T!ti*iesrwere concarnea*. Tile Indian Limitation *«.ct specifieci one year as the period curing which one can file a case for the cancoHation of such an oruer, as is clear from item 14, -mrtieie 1, Jart 1 of the Indian ^imitation ^ct* In view of this, the right of raising ait objection agi inat the cozapetemt Gover niaent servant ceased on 14th *iune 19Id on which date the Indian Limitation i*ot was still applicable in Basrah. In view of the clarity of 'Beguiation for the Cancellation of Lavs' 1 , the period cannot be extended and, accordingly, the right of putting up a claim in this case has ©lapses. Therefore, the action of tno Court of first Instance of Basrah in disregarding this point is deliberately against law and the Judgment should be set aside. In view of the above ana to the petitions which I submitted to the Court of first Instance and the reasons that I will put up before your honcutable Court, it will be clear to your Court that the Judgment appealed frora is contrary to law in several respects ana liable to be set aside. I repeat my request for setting it aside and rejecting the respondent{s (Plaintiff f sj claim ana making him bear ail Court Fees of first Instance and appellate Courts, advocate fees for conducting both the First Instance and ap .eal c^sea, fees for preparing the petitions ana travelling expenses.

Kabir has never conducted case. He was merely consulted by Partu on a point of procedure and never appeared in Court, as leader. The best course seems to me to be that the Sheikh should now ask Partu to hand over the case to another lawyer who could press Bagdad for hearing of new appeal. He can consult ivabir here in the same way that Partu did. I do no c think i-hat conscription of Partu is necessarily malicious.

Najiba is still alive. Sulaiman ash-Bhawaf is the agent of Najiba and Kamal. In her lifetime, Ayesha was indebted to certain people at Constantinople to the extent of 16.000 Dinars, /hen her creditors came to know that the Shaikh’s appeal had failed, they applied for and obtained an attachment of the Shaikh’s property up to the sura of 10.000 Dinars.

Subject: - Date Gardens Appeal Case, Sir, In continuation of my telegram No. 44, dated the 3th February, 1939, I have the honour to inform you that I have seen Abdul Jalil Partu, Lawyer to His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, and discussed the recent appeal case. I attach to this report a trans lation of a letter from him to the Shaikh in the same connection. 2. With regard to the document, which the Court found out of order, and so dismissed the case, the lawyer has pointed out in his letter that in fact the definite future tense was not used. I attach a copy of the document, in Arabic and English. Both in its fora, and in the ordinary written usage, j j &lt; 1 is imperfect tense. To make it definite future tense ^ or t* 0 should be placed in front of it, as the Bevd. G.W. TRATCHEK says in his well known Arabic Grammar, adding, page 73, paragraph 4, 'The imperfect in itself denotes only unfinished action'. Mr./2 n Cw l?0 1604 is i r r # 7‘\n Ess of Basra t the well known authority on the r^bio languagSf whom I have consulted privately, holds the view that the construction put on the sentence by the Court, occurring as it does in a dated document, and in its context, is an incorrect one, am he agrees that the way the ?hait&lt;h # s lawyer views the use of o^ in the sentence concerned is correct* Turther, as you will aee from his letter, the lawyer points out that many tiraes without question the Baghdad Appeal Courts have accepted the surety in the form in which he put it. In any case no special form is laid do m, although some lawyers, he tells me, do use the p;st tense in the surety document. He Iso quotes the decision in Case No. 247 of 1920 in the Appeal Court which was as follows: - *k surety bond is effective when the surety accepts to be so. .Cuoa acceptance should Include the word ’aurety* or any other equivalent word - sections 621 and 622 of the lajallah Code*. 3. The Judg!ient of the Appeal Court quotes article 622 of the Civil Code of Iraq - Al Hmjallah - and article 1S6 of the Civil Procad'ire Law of Iraq. I attach Arabic and .‘English copies. These articles seem to me to contain absolutely no warrant for the Judgment given by tho Appeal Court, and therefore it would further appear that it is the appeal Court, who, in lightly dismissing the case in this manner, have shorn irregularity. Mr. 0 1, learn, the Judge of the Court of First Instmce at Basra, informed ae, only this week, that/that the 3haiich*s lawyer has the reputation of being the straightest lawyer of the Basra bar, and is well known to be at enmity with the notorious Salman Shawwaf t the opposing lawyer. He himself, if he had to pick upon a good lawyer in Basra, would choose P^BTU. 4. Vith regard to the course suggested in Ambassador, Baghdad*s telegram No. 4 o f the 7th February, the remaining defendants concerned are: - (a) The inheritors of the late HATIAD bin MUBARAK as SABAH, who died after judgmenl of Court of First Instance. (b) Mariam, Ayesha and Sabika daughters of Shaikh Salim as Sabah, and Hussa bint Shaikh Salman al Hamua, whose names apparently omitted in error by the opposing lawyer. i 5. Meanwhile I suggest that the course proposed by the lawyer in his letter is also worth trying. He quotes, for authority for this course, article No. 3 of the law of 30th July 1329 A.H. and article 254 of the Iraq Civil Procedure law. Judge 0 ’MSABA infonaes me th^t such action must be taken within thirty day^s of delivery of Judgment by the Appeal Court; so no time should be lost, if an attempt to obtain revision is topbe made. In this, we could, of course, seek the aid and f advice of the British Embassy, Baghdad, where PABOT could be instructed to go pending the arrival of AHMAD RUSHDI BEY. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servanl ; \ (Sgd.) G. S. dc Gaury. \ ' t A , Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait.S T'— r ''W' WW —- ■■ —'—— •” W’ n MK 'Mgm wp After Compliments. I have received your telegram, 1 wrote a letter to you in which I mentioned the details of the case which are as follows In view of what had happened, it appears that the Court of Revision have intentionally passed their judgment against us. When the resolution of the Land Settlement was published and they had no power to deal with the case on its merits, they turned to the form of the Appeal Case.i.e., the appeal cannot be accepted unless a surety bond concerning expenses has been attached with the memorandum of appeal. W© had executeo. a surety bond bearing the signature of Sayid Hamid Bey an-Naqib, but the Court objected to the form in which it was drawn up saying that it was incorrect tas it was put in the future tense, whereas a surety bond should be put either in the past or present tense). It was, therefore, considered that the memorandum of appeal was submitted without a surety bona ana, in view of this, it did not fulfil the legal conditions, and was thus rejected. The judgment of the Court of First Instance is deemed as not appealed from conclusively within the recognized period. This order of the Court i$ contrary to law and fact since, firstly, the surety bond was written .. in this way, ”1 hereby undertake to be a surety and guarantee etc.* The Court held that it was written in the future tense as the word ” 0^ ' was used whereas the word ” * is a present verb which gives/-1%t») gives both present anh future meanings. It shall never nean a future tense unless the prefixes n ^ ?? 0 p « » have been added to it. The use of with the expression ”1 hereby under take ,f which very distinctly means the present tense, does not make it possible of being used as a future tense, but its meaning would be restricted to that of the present tense. This annuls the statement of the Court in this respect. In any case, the Article to which the Court referred,!.e. , 622 of M AL MAJALLArf* does not contain any requirement that the wording of the surety bond should be in the present or past tenses, but the said Article is in general terms and accepts as correct any expression indicating surety according to custom and usage. I used to v/rite surety bonds for all the cases which I used to submit in the past in this way and the Court used to accept them as correct.

The date of its submission to the Court and its registration there is considered to be the starting period of the appeal case. It is necessary to mention in the plaint the names and surnames of the appellant and the respondent, their profession, places of residence, the Judgment and by which Court the order appealed from was passed and on what date it was announced to the Appellant. The plaint should also include a request for the presence of the Respondent or his agent before the Court within the period fixed by law and that the Appellant has produced a suitable surety undertaking (payment of) expenses for conducting the case against/(fcs. against the Respondent before the Court of Appeal and travel ling expenses, damages and losses that may be admitted by law, if it is found that he was not justified in his case, and that the surety bond, duly attested by an official authority, has been attached to the said plaint. Any memo, of appeal that does not contain the said requirements cannot be accepted , but, if the appeal period has not yet expired, the unfulfille d requirements should be jsompleted, and if the circumstances necessitate the prepar ation of a fresh plaint , t he Appellant has a right and justification to that. Comments by Daud Camrah t a Judge of the Appeal Court, Baghdad . Here is a query,i.e.,if, for instance, the memorandum of appeal was submitted 10 days prior to the expiry of the recognized period ana, after service oi documents on the respondent and appointment of a day for hearing, the 10 remaining days of the period passed,and during the hearing the respondent objected that the surety bond was incomplete, as the Notary Public had not certified the suitability of the surety, and the Court considered this his objection justifiable, will the memoranuum of appeal be rejected on the ground that the period which is 30 days had passed as having commenced from the date of the announcement of the judgment until the date of giving out this Order, or the submission of the plaint to the Court makes the period tMjBXM current and, therefore, admissible to complete the surety bond within the remaining 10 days which start from the date of the announcement of this Order? A similar question came up before the Court of Revision at Constantinople which issued a decision on the 14th November 1318 to the following effect:- \ The applicant for revision applied for a revision of the judgment 17 days prior to the expiry of the/- v•« ** •* + 1604 of the announcement of this order to him, submit a fresh plaint containing revisional requirements as provided in the last paragraph of Article 223 of Civil Procedure Law. This order of the Revision Court concerns the revision and its requirements. If we accept the opinion given in the appeal and its requirements, we will be making a move nearer to justice and law. The Iraq Court of appeal confirmed this opinion in several decisions, thus the requirements which are not fulfilled were completed during the remaining period which commences from the date of the announcement of the order passed regarding the existence of unfulfilled requirements.

Procedure outlined by Baud Samrah, page 628, does not seem to apply (see page 626), because document was held to be not an incorrect guarantee but no guarantee at all: Consequently appeal documents were incomplete ab initio. C. , Court of Appeal appears to be the only authority competent to transfer the case to the Land Settlement Committee^ D. All or some of the defendants on whom the Basra judgement has not yet been served should appeal at once (this, I am told, can be done without service, or after service has been obtained on application). F. i suggest consideration of this course can wait. 2. Further course, strongly recommended to me, is as follows:- Appellant should at once file fresh appeal, (documents being correctly drafted), with application to the president of the Court of Cassation to admit time- expired appeal under discretion given to him by Article 7 (2) of Court's proclamation of 27th December 1917 (amended/ \^6 2o (amended by Court’ s (revision) Proclamation of 1921). If this application is admitted, appeal would be re-heard and (we may hope; case transferred to Land Settlement. It cannot, however, be guaranteed that President of the Court would accept application. 3o Best course therefore seems to be combination of D. and the above. Surety bond mentioned in Resident's telegram 54 T. was probably accepted by the Court because no objection wa- raised by opposing coensel, 4. Those whom I have consultedargue that nothing good could come from action through diplomatic channel.

On Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ivushlre■ (% ^ ^ On the roll owing day (February 7 th) I instructed the Oriental aecretary to discuss with Saiyid Yueuf al Kabir (a lawyer of standing who la frequently consulted by the 5:*cba»sy on legal raatters) the situation created by the decision of the Court of Appeal. v suurrAry of this discussion, together with a translation of i. J. Partou’s note, the ^ifalah and the judgment of the iourt of appeal are enclosed herein. 4. The only course ol action *hich now appears to offer any chance of is that unseated by Judge Prichard, in the opinion of ^aiyid /usuf al x ablr aucn tactics, at the best, could only save a small part of the property in question but I suggest that the Judge’s plan should be carefully examined and if possible put into effect in the hope that his opinion may prove in the end to be correct. 6. Another point also eeems to need examination. The original petition filed in this case appears to be a claim to only one-third of the Faddaghiyah property. If this is so it would probably be well for the Shaikh’s lawyers to consider carefully the effect on the remaining two-thirds of the property of the rejection of the appeal and of the declaration of hand settlement. If in epite of the subsequent declaration of Land Settlement in the Fao Hahiyah there is any likelihood of the application to the remainder of the Faddaghiyah property of the judgment already given in the Basra Courts this could poesibly be prevented by the procedure auggeatod by Judge Prichard. 6. 1 am not myself in a position to do more than offer tentatively the above suggestions but no doubt you will ta*e such steps as you think fit to secure for the Shaikh the best advice on the course of action which it is now in his interest to take. 7.

J. Partou (translations are attached) and I then asked him what he thought of the drafting of the security (Kifalah). He said that it was undoubtedly carelessly worded and that the opposing lawyer had seized upon an obvious defect in its drafting. I asked what he thought of the Courts dedision to reject the appeal on such a point* He said that appeals were frequently rejected because the securities were faulty and he added that for this reason, when making an appeal he himself always gave the utmost care and attention to the preparation of the security* we then looked up the article of the Mejallah (Turkish Civil Code) mentioned in the decision of the Court of Appeal (Article 622)* This article in the translation made by C* k* Tyser, B* A* L*, (Government Printing Office, Cyprus, i^oi&gt; read as follows:- M 622* The proposal of the guarantor, that is to say, the expression for suretyship, is the words which by use and custom are evidence of the undertaking and taking upon oneself. For example* If one says W I am become surety” or ”1 have guaranteed” or ”1 am bound to pay” the surety becomes a concluded agreement.” It thus indicates the importance of putting the essential words in the present and not in the future tense.

The Court of Appeal had given a decieion which every lawyer would rtcorniee ae being legal and proper and there seeaed to him to be no eec*pe from it (Judg?« Pridiard whom 1 con»ulted yeetorday held the eame view). I then outlined at a purely personal idea the euggeetion amde to me privately by Judge Prichard. I ml6 that it seemed that four of the defendant* cited in the original petition brought before the court of •stret Instance in Baora had not yet been oerved with the Judgment given by that court in June 1938. If they now applied for judgment would it bf possible, after • ex-vice had been effected, to make * new appeal within the prescribed period. Yusuf al K&amp;bir *aid that it would. I then asked what would be the effect on the rights of the other defendants if on such am appeal being made a judgment was given transferring the caseto Land Ho »»id that such a decision by tho Court of A^o«l ^ould auoiy to th* sharoo which the** four defendants could claim in the disputed property, the shares derolvln^ by hypothesis on the others would be held to b« corered by the judgment of the Basra Court which hod bscorn*- final on the rejection of the eppeel made on lebruary 6th* ^Judge Prichard 1 » suggestion on the other hand was that if on appeal was made on behalf of the four defendants on whom judgment had not yet been served and the Court of Appeal transferred the case to Land Settlement the other defendants could apply for the same decision to be applied to thesO 1 asked Xusuf al K&amp;bir if he could suggest any other Plan* He said that it was difficult to be positive without studying all the owners but prim* facie he saw little hope of ^ny moans being found to overcome or get round the judgment of the Court of Beera now that the appeal had been rejected* V # H* 7/2/39.I called on you at the office but you were not there. The Court have ruled that the security which we submitted with the petition of appeal was invalid because it reads M I undertake that X will be”, which clause the court have held to indicate the future, and they have accordingly dismissed the appeal holding that every petition of appeal must be accompanied by a security in sound form otherwise it is rejected. I believe the court's ruling to be obviously erroneous from the linguistic point of view, there being no special form of future tense in the Arabic language, and the so-called Mudhari (quasi-present) form serves to indicate both the present and the future. when the future is to be indicated in particular the prefix 'sa' or ”sauf” is used with the verb. The wording of the security plainly indicates the present inasmuch as the word ”undertake” occurs therein without the prefix ”sa” or ”sauf”. The relevant article of law, namely Article 62% of the kejalla specifically lays down that security shall be drawn in terms indicating the present or the past. I therefore beg that you will refer the point to some scholar of the Arabic language, and, if such scholar upholds my view, I beg that you will get in touch with the Ministry of Justice with a view to our referring the case to the Legal Drafting Department.

We fully agree here that immediate steps should be taken to provide the Sheikh with adequate legal assistance. Indeed, we feel that, if we are to save anything from the wreck, it would be best for His Majesty’s Government to take over the conduct of the case altogether. We should however wish to know what the views of the Embassy at Bagdad are before we commit ourselves to getting Rushdi Bey from Egypt again. As we see it, the Sheikh must in any case have an Iraqi lawyer, since only Iraqis are allowed to plead in the Courts, and in many ways a competent man in Bagdad may be even more important than the best foreign lawyer, especially if the latter only comes on flying visits. We consider, therefore, that we should get the Sheikh a good Iraqi lawyer, whether Rushdi Bey comes or not. The cost of engaging an Iraqi lawyer R*T. Peel, Esq. , M.C.m wm mm lawyer will be small compared with that of bringing someone from Egypt, and it would seem rather a doubtful economy to turn down the idea of engaging an Iraqi lawyer on the grounds of expense. As you say, the proposal, if adopted, may involve the Embassy in considerable extra work, but they would not, I am sure, wish their convenience to be considered to the detriment of other factors, and as a matter of fact no one could cause the Embassy, or any of us, as much trouble as the present lawyer to the Sheikh has done, whether through incompetence or worse. We realize that the Sheikh apparently objected last year to the Embassy selecting an Iraqi lawyer to help, or replace, Partu. Seeing where the latter has got him, however, and in view of our interest in the case, we feel that the Sheikh can hardly make difficulties this time. We would propose therefore to approach the Treasury now for sanction to engage an Iraqi lawyer to be recommended by the Embassy. We should also propose to217 to ask the Embassy if they think it worthwhile bringing Rushdi Bey from Egypt as well, and we would meanwhile ask the Treasury to agree to his being brought, if the Embassy advise it. Perhaps you will let me know by telephone if you agree. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale at the Treasury.India Office, / P.Z.982/39. '/hitehall, London, S#\7.1 15th February, 1939 Urgent . Lould you please refer to the enclosures to our covering letters of the 13th and 14th February, Nos. P.Z. 872, 976 and 982/39, relating to the law suit about the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens at Paddaghiyah. » In his telegram of the 13th February T/26, Fov/le has \ misunderstood our telegram of the 11th which of course was intended to convey that the Foreign Office suggestion meant taking the case completely out of the Sheikh’s hands, but you will see that at the end of his telegram No.T/20, he ^ suggests that Pushdi Bey (or a substitute) should be fetched from Egypt as soon as possible to conduct the case, at the expense of His Majesty’s Government. 7e agree that this should be the immediate step to be taken and we are jJ inclined to think that if this is done, and the Sheikh’s — 9 . f . lav/yer in future proceeds under pushdi Bey s instructions, this should be sufficient to ensure that the case is H.L. Baggallay Esq., Foreign Office, S.7.1. handled/2 . handled properly, without going to the length of finding an Iraqi lav/ycr to replace the Sheikh’s choice, which would probably add to the expense, give the Emoassy some further trouble, and perhaps cause some embarrassment . with the SheikhJ^ But if you would prefer to have Fowle’s views on the point, we will of course consult him again. With regard to the question of the Sheikh claiming recovery of the purchase price of the property one would infer from Fowle’s telegram T/26. that no such action has yet been taken (cf. the end of the penultimate paragraph of the Basra Court’s judgment, copy enclosed with India Office letter of the 11th November, P.Z. 7489/38). If that is so, it would socm desirable that something should be done in the matter without delay and it is for consideration whether the Sheikh should be advised to take up this question immediately with his lawyer - irrespective of any decision that may be taken to assist or even replace the latter at the expense of Government^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale.Draft Paper.

British judge on court of appeal has given confidentially following account of the hearing of the Faddaghiyah case yesterday morning. Ministry of Finance having confirmed that property in question was situated with Fao Nahiyah judges were evidently prepared to follow precedent of judgement enclosed in my letter of November 3rd and to transfer case to land settlement. However when case opened the opposing lawyer pleaded that appeal was not valid as security for costs (which has to accompany all appeals) was incorrectly worded (point was that document declared surety would accept all liability for costs instead of that he accepted all liability, i.e. future tense was used instead of the present) court admitted this plea and rejected appeal. British judge agrees that this was proper and unavoidable decision and attributes gross ignorance or complicity to Sheik’s lawyer for having drafted document as he did. Privately he indicates one possible loophole. Judgement given by the Court of first instance at Basra has not yet been served on four of named defendants. Sheik s lawyer should arrange service and then make new appeal on behalf of these four persons. If judgement is given transferring case to land settlement application could then be made to Court [grp. undec.] similar ruling to be applied to all defendants. f This device has not been revealed to Sheik’s lawyer since having ' regard to judge’s comments mentioned above the Sheik or his adviser ‘ may wish to put the oase in other hands.

I have no doubt, however, that the Shaikh's lawyer can take steps to obtain early information on this point through the usual legal channels. 14th to de Gaury, I am sending you herewith an Arabic copy and an English translation of a Judgement which establishes a precedent for the transfer by the Court of Appeal to the Land Settlement Officer of a case concerning land situated in an area over which Land Settlement was declared after a As regards the Faddaghiyah appeal, I fear that it As regards paragraph 4 of your letter of October /Judgment The Honourable Lieut-Colonel Sir T.C. .Fowle, K•C•I• ., C.B.h., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf BUSHISKKS)—'7 \ ' i P.2. . t 7849 judgment in the case had been givtn in the Court First Instance.

He demanded that such registration should not be allowed, that a judgment should be given prohibiting the finance Department from op osing his clients in their tasarruf of the Arasas in /questionquestion, and that the Department in qucs tioj? pay the: court costs and lawyer’s fees. On 10th August, 1935, the Court in ( Lesl8)?&amp;suJ d in respect of Case No. 130/33 a judgment in public prohibiting the interference of the defendant Department with the tasarruf, by the plaintiff, of the five arasas of which the boundaries are given in the statement of the case, and decided to reject the request of the three eldermen of the Tel Kaif village to become a third party in the case. As the defendant Directorate of Tapu was not satisfied with this judgment, they requested that it should be ixamined in appeal and cancelled. Likewise the eldeimcn of Tel Kaif village submitted on 22nd January, 1936, an appeal for the canctllation of the judgment issued by the Court of First Instance rejecting their application to become a third party to the case. As it appeared that these two appeals were made in respect of one judgment, the Court of Appeal decided to unify them and to reconsider them as one case. As it appeared from the statement of the counsel for the Awqaf Department that the Department in question acted in this case on behalf of one of the Mutawallis (Administrators), namely, Abdul ^ahman Asif, who was a minor, and as this person has since become of age, there remained no need for the Department in question to continue in this capacity. The counsel for the ap, ellunt Department of Tapu Agreed and requested that the Mutawaili bdul Rahman Asif should be invited to participate in the case and the * aqf Department removed.

T hird Party : Lawyer Ibrahim Haji, attorney for Husain Al-Hai‘iad. The Basra Court of Instance sat on the 15th of Hazeeran 1938 under the Presidentship of President l.C. Good and membership of the Deputy President Saj^id Mahmud Khalis, and Justice Sayid Ibrahim Al-Sa’adi, who were authorised to administer Justice in the name of K.H. the King of Iraq., and they have given the following Judgement: - The plaintiff claims one-third, inherited from his aunt Awwashah, of the parcel of date gardens situated in the district of Bao and registered in the Tapu under serial Hos. 94,95,96 and 97 of Kanoon-thani 324, and 11 and 12 permanent dated August 1915. It is alleged that the defendents put their hands over the said properties and began preventing him from taking possession, and they iiave in an unlawful manner obtained Tapu Documents Nos. 13,14,15,16,17, and 18 of August 1915. He therefore asks for restraining them from preventing him, and for nullification of the Tapu Documents which they have o-efraine obtained in their own names, and for holding them responsible for the payment of the Court fees and lawyer’s fees. In this claim he relies on the legal division dated 31 Kano on Awwal 1931, and 24th Aab 1932, and on the Tapu documents Hos. 11 and 12 of August 1915, and Hos. 94,95,96 and 97 of Kanoon Thani 324, and on the maps which he put forward, Hos.3836,3837 and 3838 dated 1.10.32, and on the Tapu registrations standing in the names of the defendents, Hos. 13,14,15,16,17 and 18 of£t\ 2(&amp; - 2 - of Augiost 1915, s Vhile trie case was pending the plaintiff died and his sole legal heirs were his wife Hafsa who gets one share and his son Kemal who gets 7 shares, and as Kenal is mad he was represented 'by Sulaiman A1 -Shaw.vaf, Lawyer, as a fully authorized guardian , in accordance with the Judgement of Trusteeship of 10.5.35 -The proceedings took place against Hamad and Abdulla sons of Shaikh Mubarak, and Ahmed, Hamud, Mariam and Shaikhah heirs of Shaikh Jahir, and Abdulla, Hah ad, Sub ah, Bibi and Leelwah heirs of Shaikh Salim, and Subah and Bazzah heirs of Shaikh Nasir, while represented, and against Hurah and Munirah heirs ot Snaikh Nasir, while un-represented. The plaintiff was represented by Sulaiman Al-Snawwaf and Majid Al-Bawwi, and the defendenfs were represented by Lawyer Abdul Jalil Bertow. The defence of the defendants: - ( 1 ) That Kuwait is an independent Amir ate under the Protection of Britain, and that is in accordance with a special agreement between Britain and the Amir ate o.l Kuwait, that the said Amirate defended to his son Shaikh Jabir Al-Mubarak Al-Subah, and thence to his grand-son Shaikh Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir Al-3ubah, therefore, according to international law, the dispute becomes outside the scope of jurisdiction of the Courts, and that it becomes purely a matter of state, and that accordingly the dispute becomes 1 one between Great Britain and Iraq., said that there is in existence a treaty between Britain and Iraq, under which the Iraq. Government took over responsiblity of the undertakings made by Britain. ( 2 ) The defence by the Indian and Civil Passage of Time Law, as more than fifteen years have passed in which time the plaintiff could have put his claim and could have proved the legality of it by personal proofs. That the prowerties were registered in the names of the defendants according to an order issued by the Inspector of finance on 14th iugust 1915 and numbered 504, and that it was an order by a competent authority, and that in view of thethe Indian Passage of Time Law the claim should have been made within one year from the date of the order, and that cases which have been time harred hy the said Law cannot he revived after that law has been dissolved. As the dispute centres over the properties of Paddagiyyah which the Amir of Kuwait had purchased from Abdul Wahab -asha al-Gurtas, aa attorney to Awwashah Al-Zuhair, and registered it in the na names of his sons under Tapu llos. 13,14,15,16,17 and 18 of August 1915, and that this was effected by an order issued by the Inspector of finance at the time of registration during the Turkish regime which the Turkish Government ordered to be poaooned until further notice, and that, therefore, Abdul \7ahab Pasha the attorney went , in the presence of the British Consul on 9.2.1909, and signed the deed of purchase, and compliance with the application of the agent of Shaikh Mubarak the properties were registered in the names of his sons, therefore the plea that the registrations were not in accordance with the law and the rules of the Tapu, and that the deed was un-official, is a rejectable plea which has no value by law. This is the substance of the defence plea. The Lawyer Ibrahim Naji put forward an application on behalf of his client asking for enterance as a third party. After each of the two parties have repeatedly put forward their pleas and secured the case, the court decided to end the suit as follows: - After going through the case, it became clear that the plaintiff relies on Tapu registrations which are the legal means, and the legal divisions and maps put forward. The defence of'the lawyer of the defendants consists of his objection to the jurisdiction of the Courts, and Civil and his plea by the Indian/Passage of Time, the lawfulness of possession of his clients as being the result of a sale deed which was registered by order of the Inspector of Finance Sir Henry Dobbs. In considering the first plea oi the defence lawyer, the court ai(i not find that there4 existed any treaty which points to the recognition of Kuwait as 'being an Independent State recognised 'by Iraq, or other G-overnments. The case is a personal one and has nothing to do with state natters, and as the said, pro^e-i.ties are within Iraq, the case has 'become one which is under the jurisdiction of the local courts• Tne plea of passage ox Tine is not acceptable, 'because, assuming the deferdents took possession of the said properties, as is maintained 'by them, in August 1915, we find that they did not hold to the plea of Passage of Time at all, and they did not preserve it, in fact their lawyer, before the court decided whether there is a passage of time or not, has entered into the merits of the case, as can be seen from the vrritten pleas which he put forward, especially the plea dated 2n.o,3S in which he had clearly confessed in pages 10,11,12,15 etc. etc, that the parcels of properties at Paddagiyyah Kos. 1-3,14,15, 16, l 17 8c 18 of August 1915 has come by way of purchase between the agent of the bequeiher oi the plaintiffs and the bequether of the defendents, and he conlessed that tne sale did not take place at the Tapu Department, but took place at the British Consulate during the time of the Turkish Government , and that it has been registered ao the instance of the agent of the Amir of Kuwait, when the Inspector of finance has issued his said order for the registrations in the names of the sons of Shaikh Hubarak —Subah. Therefore, after such a comession tne-i-e rs.-iains no ground for revieving the plea of Passage of Time or giving a decision according to it. He has also confessed on page 14 of the said plea that the said properties were registered in the names of Jabir, Salim, llasir, Hamad and Abdulla sons of Shaikh Mubarak Al-Subah, and also the trees were registered in their names as these were also entered in the sale, and when we examine the plea of the defendents we find that they confess clearly about the illegality oi their possession of the said properties as t.ie sale was nou registered at the Tapu on behalf of the owner direct, or5 or on 'behalf of her agent*, or the agent of her agent. According to the law of possession of iramoveahle properties which was in force on that date, 'every sale which takes place out of the Tapu Department is not effective, and a registration hy an order of an official, without relying on a law, is not effective”. The defendents did not put a ' w ninrimn i ftanin claim for the return of the value of this.sale, therefore it connection. The Court, therefore, has unanimously decided to restrain the defendents, and to remove their hands from the said properties, and to nullify the Tapu Documents hos, 13, 14,15,16,17 Sc 18 of August 1915, which are situated at faddagiyyah, and registration of the properties in the names of the heirs of Awwashah Al-Zuhair, against Shaikh Hamad and Abdulla, and Shaikh Ahmed, Hamad, ITariam, Shaikh ah, Abdulla, Tahad, Subah, Tibi, Leelwah, Subah and Hazzah, while represented, and against ITurah, Munirah heirs of Shaikh Nasir Shaikh Mubarak, while not represented. It is open to objection and appeal. As the demand of tne third person for being entered into the case, as such, has been put late, when the case is about to end, it is decided tnat lie is not accepted as a third party in the suit, and that ne is directed to put his case before the competent Courts to prove his claim.

My dear Weightman, It has been a mystery why there was much delay in the service of Judgtiment in the Faddaghiya case, on which service our notice of Appeal must attend, and be made within thirty days of it. 3 . Saleman bhawwaf is well off, and has many resources, and it seems unlikely that it is really essential for him to acquire the Court Fees (£.300/-) by attachment, as he is now apparently doing. 3 . Our people thought that the reason for delay might be that ohawwaf (a) Thinks he may lose the case on appeal, and is therefore anxious to delay until he finds a friend of his has been appointed to the Appeal Court, or he has had ti :e to 'prepare' the appeal court judges. or (b) believes we may offer to settle out of court (Hints have reached me that he would be willing to do so) and is therefore waiting a move by us. 4 , In view of recent developments however (see my telegrar s Nos.285 and 236 of 7th and 3th September respectively regarding attachment of Faddaghiyya). I incline to think that the explanation of the delay will be found therein. He intended to have the usufruct of uhe estate this year, by attachment, before and without service of judgement i.e.without opening the road to us for an appeal. ¥ 5 # I presume that the service of Judgement, must now take place, once the year’s crop has been sold, and the court fees paid.

They were disposed to take the line that matter was personal one as between two claimants but it was represented to them that present development must prejudice settlement of the whole question of the Shaikh’s properties. Ministry eventually undertook to approach Ministry of Justice with a view to ascertaining position and seeing what if anything could be done. Present position regarding Land Settlement is obscure but I was assured that on application of Land Settlement Law authorities would make detailed investigation into all matters concerning Shaikh s rights. These matters would include documents connected with the present case and eventual settlement would not therefore necessarily be prejudiced thereby.

If we revert after this to the definition of the is confession* a reference to this^/aade in Artlele 1690 of the ft ! agallaii^ which runs as follows:- ^Confession Is an acimowlodgrient by a person of a right belonging to another, therefore ho is called the confer nor, while tiie other is called the person confessed to, and the ri^t, tiie acknowledged right# After explaining these rules, we have to return to what the plaintiff called the acknowledged right. It appears that the plaintiff has not understood the real fact or attempted to establish the contrary. All that we said is that we purchased that property and produced docur-scnts i-* support thereof. whis rebuts the claiii put for^mrd by the plaintiff for the ownez^ship of that property. therefore the prescription neither repels nor forfeit© the stateroent m&amp;o by us in this connexion. i where now rcaauine the (juestlon of the legal excuse* The plaintiff appears to ’nave diffMFeA froc ue In the Interpretatior of the Intei’mlttent abecnce and gave as evidence of hie allega tion the text of Articles 1465 and 1464. He oowaitted a r.latake In this and perhaps he wished to refer to Articles 1065 and 1664. Before discussing the provisions of those two Articles, we consider It advisable to spent briefly on the question of the excuses that repel the lapse of time. 1 e have now an epistle by iiaitr© akl Kheir A1 Abu 'feegi Dey, President of the Parquet in the Civil circle of the Court of Casr-ation, called Tuspension of prescription for compulsory rea sorb and incapacitated olrcunistances. On perusal of that epistle we found that It contained the opinions of the author as well as those other legal authorities which are the sunaary of e lenghty study in connexion with the prescription and its suspension. /The epistle- 8 «* The epistle i» worthy of consideration and appreciation. The author mentions on p&amp;g© 11 oi that epistle the f^ollowing*•» Baudret (?) and Teasie (?) are oi‘ the opinion that the prescription wis eiieeted ^or social interest visi the stability of the fait acconpli and paying no Ixecd to past events, overlooking the wlsdoo iri onactlng tiie law of proscription! in the nont 1 olor.ic:-t i a ir legislation vi : the proscription is based m the pro sumption that the ov?ner of the right has neglected his right and left it, and did not pay any attention for its n&amp;intenmc© and therefor© the incapable person is to be exerted from the application of the prescription on account of his lack of discrimination* The same should be logically applied to whoever cannot maintain Ills right owing to forced circumstances, because in that case he absolutely canno^ claim his right* It is inpossible to ascribe to negligence or inability a case where action was impossible. A person cannot be asked to do the impossible. In reply to B&amp;udret and Tesaie f s allegation that the interest of the individual should be forfeited for public interest, the author points out that la^s wore intended for the complete sacrifice of the interest of the individual to the public benefit, but that the interest of the Individual should also be taken into consideration* The author of the epistle then left to reasons for the prescription for discussion of legal excuses, and dealt with the question of absence, pointing out on page 13 the following:** tt The question of absence h$s remained the source of difference of opinion In the Jgyptian Courts, owing to the text of Article 152 of a book called *2 urehed al Eayraan' ( A guide for the perplexed) which places absence with minority and lunacy, end considers it among legal excuses which prevents the progress of lapse of time. /The author9 - 9 - (SS) The author then expressed his person 1 opinion i ith regard to the question of absence and stated on page 14 the following:- 'Distinction should be nade In the case of absence betroon things* If the absence is a con on one, (i*e* if an a person leaves for a certain lawm or^ttoiaiMB place and tiien returns) his absence in this case cannot prevent the progress of prescription, because it ms possible for hixs to take the necosrary taeasures before his departure for the protection of his rights fron forfeiture# Even if he lives for amy frees his country, it is possible for hin - in the existence of the present facilities agreed upon anong the various Govemnonts • to send a power of Attorney to whoever represents him in claim ing his right®, failing this he will be considered negligent# ?rescrip tion cannot be suspended in the presumption of negligence as already mentioned# An exceptional case should be Allowed if the absentee suffered from a forced incident during his absence, mich as captivity, the cutting of ccormnlections, or the quarantine restrictions on account of pest, etc* In these oases the proscription cannot be operative for reasons of absence but for the forced incident vfoich ms not the result of any negligence# But if a person ms osused to be Absent by force, for example being deported from his own country, eueh person shall not be excused if it was in his ability before his dep&lt; rturc to appoint m gent or was, during his deportation, able to appoint m representative to file a suit claiming his ri^ht# ihe contrary is applied. If it has bom proved that he was deported to a place there he could not appoint on \gent, or me in a state of absolute inability to do anything to maintain Ms rij^ht* : uch a oaso is oonoidorafl to bo of a forced nature rtdeh warrants the suspension of prescription. ooordina to fharia (i.e. IalaEsie Kelialous uw -trans lator) uthorlties, where a person is held to be absent, his case, under Sheris Law comes under one of two heads, either /where«hor® he appoint® an Agent before hia absence to maintain Ills property aiu5 adminloter his affairs, or «her® he has no Agent. In the letter ease the Sharia Judge appoint® an Agent for him. See Articles 578 and 573 In the hook on 'Sharia Rules rogirding Verson'd Status' hy Xadrl ’ aaha. In both esses the proscription should be applied eigalnst him, beeause the ngent represents hia In the maintenance of his rights against forfeit. ~r« t * of negligence on the part of the Agent, he hineelf or hie heirs have grounds of action against the Agent. It may be pointed out In objection to this that sr.e prescription is not applied to the incapacitated for rhom a guardian or attendant la appointed to administer his affairs and maintain his rigits. In reply to this I have to say that the incapacitated lacks discrimination and cannot administer his ovn affairs, if he find® his guardian or attendant negligent la his rights. 'ihsrsfws the legislator provided a special procedure for this. the absentee of complete lMeopacity md dlsorlmlnatlsn cam administer his oan affairs and maintain his ovn rights. If he appoints an Agent, or ouch an Agent is appointed hy the Judge on hie behalf, he has t* undergo the consequences of his bad selection In the first place, and the non-ndminietrc.tion of his own affaire which Is a kind of negligence and docs mrreat the suspension of ths proscription. Iso If the judge appoint® an / gent to an absentee whoe? ^-v. e*! -u intermittent, and that If his absence ms of his own accord leaving hla affairs without balng administer*® and hi# ritfvte maintained# this Is also considered a ne^lgence ^hloh does not warrant the suspension of the prescription. In this sasa the forced events are excluded. to suiamrise these opinions the suspension of the proscription goes back to 3 things visi incapacity, force 1 mjeur and absence. *ho author oor.alders force raajeur is that in which a person is In a state of absolute laposaibilty /to elaimmem to olai© his yight. * alao oonaidora t at tha prescription u 4&gt; Id he ap lied to the Agent* if auoh agent is appointed by the absentee himself or by the judge on his behalf* \m also to eooelioi's that the prescription cannot te spelled taDQ^sri the inoepaoiteted whether or not he has a guardian. He aleo explains the difference fee tween the incapacitated and the absentee. The opinion expressed by the author is the exact text o# article I66i ex' the 'Magalleh whle runs as follows:* * lapse of tine as e bar to the hearing of a ease au»t be where the actual period has passed without legal excuse, is regards a period which has passed with a legal excuse as whore the plaintiff was a mirier, or insane, whether haring guardian or not, or was in a far eountiy, or whose legal opponent is one who conquered the country by force, such cannot be tahen as an example, seeing that the period can only be counted from the date on which he reached his majority, ilso If a person who has a case against a conqueror and cannot put up a olalsi during the period of the conquest and it is found that lapse of time does bar the hearing of the ease, such prescription shall date tiom the termination of that eonque&amp;t. * It a pears tsom that text that when referring to the ineapaeitated, it was decided not to apply the prescription whether euoh person was legally represented or not. The author later referred to the abeentee and did not mention anything regarding hie legal repre sent at i to. This dietinotlon on his part ;aeana that the case with regard to absence differs from that of incapacity. That is to say he taakas no difference In the case of incapacity itself, whether there is representative or otherwise. In the oase of ebsence, the presence of an igent prevents the suspension of prescription whether such i&gt;f*»t was appointed by the absentee or the Judge. This is exactly the Islamic dh*r v la Hules, as considered by Malt re Zmki ..heir jl- i&gt;bu Te gi hey. Turning..I* - Ttcrning to the subject matter of the present case after referring to the ahovern ntioned rules, vvq notice that Mad eins iwvasha il- do heir has appointed her husband - Shined Pasha il-doheir- as igent and the latter in turn appointed itdel V.ahali Pastoa il- jortea and that the # &gt; j existewje of that power of attorney prevents the suspension ; of the prescription# The absence of that Ifcdy so long as she has an igent representing her cannot be pleaded in testator favour of Madame jjwvy&amp;sha, the plainti £f’s xsteitlfiNP* 0i 01 the defendant himself* In the text referring to absence as described in irticle 1663, the absence might be considered as arising from force majeur, seeing that travelling at that time was difficult, i#e• when this rule was Anacted. But now that the means of travelling have become easy, the reason for the enactment of that legislation has nov disappeared, effect that is to say both cause r*nd dodraoxt have totally disanpeared. anyhow whether the absence is as stipulated in Article 1663 or not, it has become no longer a reason which wax-rants the suspension of prescription in so far as the ease under reference is concerned.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 30th July, 1938. V ' *C) 1.1 Z or 7 - &lt;2-^- G Dear Gibson, You might be interested to see the enclosed copy of a letter which Rushdi Bey has sent the i^rnbassy at Cairo giving his opinion on the strength oi the Shaikh of Koweit’s case in the Faddaghiyah suit. The Embassy have pointed out that the meaning of paragraph 4 is not very clear. If it is that the Iraqi judges would be favourably influenced by the Sheikh’s action in supporting us in 1914, Rushdi .ley seems to be /assessing their powers of gratitude rather high; but it 1 is not clear that he does mean this for you will see that he recommends in paragraph 5 that His Majesty’s Government should take the matter up with the Iraqi b* Government through the diplomatic channel before judgment on the appeal is given. This does not look as though he thought very much of the Sheikh’s chances of winning, and J.P. Gibson, Esq. 2 AUG 1938 INDIA OFFICEand Judge Lloyd, who has just retired after many years * service at Basra and recently saw Beckett, gave it as his personal opinion that the Sheikh v/ould lose. In a way this is not encouraging, hut at least it seems to show that we are on the right lines in pressing on with the proposal to apply Land Settlement procedure. Yours sincerely,C? .P£: (E 4421/28/93) SECRET. 1938 j Dear Mr. Ward, In reply to your letter No. 192/27/38, I have the honour to inform you that the case of the Sheikh of Koweit is correct in pursuance of the laws operative in Iraq, and that the document relative thereto are also correct from the point of view of those laws. I have explained these opinions in three notes which I submitted to the Basra Court. I have also discussed in those notes the whole case from all points of view. It is noteworthy to invite your attention to the fact that these notes were not a mere defence in favour of the Sheikh of Koweit hut that their contents were written from deep belief and true faith. I have not contented myself with my opinion on this case, but I have also sought the opinion of many legal author ities about the contents of my notes, and they have fully agreed with me. I take this opportunity - though this occurred to my mind before the arrival of your above-mentioned letter - to mention to you briefly my belief in the destiny of the case. Courts in Iraq are composed of Iraqi judges presided over by English magistrates. I have observed that Iraqis in general are affected by their feelings more than their minds. Perhaps in so far as this case is concerned they have not yet forgotten that the Sheikh of Koweit supported the English in 1914, and offered them facilities for the occupation of Basra. This he did by standing against the Turkish army until the arrival of British troops from India. An agreement in this sense was concluded between the Sheikh and the British Govern ment. I think that in giving judgment in this case those judges were still affected by that past memory.I consider, therefore, that the only solution for this case is that an appeal should be raised now against the judgment given by the Basra Court, and before a judgment is given by the Court of Appeal in this respect, it is necessary that the British Government should meanv/hile enter into political conversations with the Iraqi Government about this matter. The British Government has the right to do so in accordance with the Treaties concluded between it, Iraq and the Sheikh of Koweit. The above is briefly my opinion explained to you, and I am prepared to give you any further details which you consider necessary with a view to take a decision on this matter. Please accept my esteemed respect, (Signed) AHMED ROUSHDI. 1.7.58.(E.^±49/28/93.) NO DISTRIBUTION. Telegram (en clair) to Sir M. Lampson (Alexandria). Foreign Office. 28th July, 1938. No. 39 Saving.

We note from this correspondence that de Gaury is arranging for a copy of the judgement in the Faddaghiyah case to be sent to Rushdi Bey at Cairo. We feel here that we should certainly provide the Sheikh with sane legal assistance during the appeal, if it comes off, i. e. if proceedings are not stayed by the application of Land Settlement Procedure, and it would no doubt be unfair to hold it against Rushdi Bey that he lost the first round. Though some of the arguments on international law advanced in his various memoranda to the Court have indeed seemed to us rather doubtful, we have no reason to suppose that his pleading is not generally an able document and he must know the case well by now; and in view of the obvious disadvantages in changing horses in mid-stream, we are inclined 1 J.P.

It is regretted that we are at a loss whether the contents of our two legal Kotos have not been properly understood by our opponents or vfhexiher we tailed to produce documents in their support or mention the sources of law from which they were taken, the opinions of the legal authorities, and the decrees issued by the Courts in similar cases, so that as a result our Kotos were so weak as to induce our opponents to P a y no attention to them, or alternatively thaw the legal contents of those Kotes were so strong as to bewilder our opponents, and leave them in a state oi dlssiness* As a matter of fact when pleading in that case we did not cite any article, quote any opinion, or mention any similar decree without indicating their original sources, and referring to the pages of the works relating thereto. low our opponents have reverted to their allegation generally and not in detail to the effect that our pleading in that case was without any support. They have, however, failed to discuss our arguments in this connexion and to mention whether our statement was correct or otherwise. As regards the question of repellenc© arising from the alleged incompetency of the Court, we have already based our case on two points:- (a) The capacity of the defendant Sheikh Ahtied Al Gaber A1 Sabah as mlr of J oweit, and (b) Great Britain standing as grantor for the property of She! h Lubarak k /Te have ^ ——?© h5?ve already uentlonod that for these two reasons the hearing of the ease is outside the jurisdiction of that Court, seeing that the subject natter of the case falls within the jurisdiction of International Ireatiee* hereas the subject matter of this case falls within the competency of -renties, the Courts have no right to issue a decree thereon* seeing that everything that falls within the competency of the treaties falls within the jurisdiction of the $zocutive and not the judicial authorities* and that these authorities should not transgress on the rights of each other* in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. re have* however* gained a great benefit In that our opponents hnve* after great trouble* waived their litigation against CheiMi Gabor hxaed A1 Sabah* SheiKh of ov/oit* as laid down on pig© 1 of their third Hote which is the subject of reply* the following: - hatevor the case may be and in order to refute the allegation of the defendants, I am prep rod to turn out Sheikh ahmed A1 Gabor from the case and direct it at present against the others mentioned by hin in the bill of indictment*' In waiving ills litigation against Sheikh Ahmed AX Gaber* the plaintiff adr;its of the first reason of the rape Hence that the case does not fall within the competency of the Court. jhis reason which vr© have already montionod is that the Courts have no oprpctency to consider that case* cnpoctally as Sheikh Ahmed AX Gaber 1 Sabah is the Chief of an independent State and enjoys the privileges of other Hinge and Heads of £‘ow©re as provided for In General International haw* Uieugh the plaintiff has in his 1 ote expressed a readiness to turn out ' hclkh .-hned Al Gabo? from that case* he* ho’?evar* did so after alleging that tlie case was a personal one which deals with a dispute of property and therefore falls under general laws which arc applied by the Courts. He gave as an evidence of his allegation in this connexion th&amp;t the /Court lias3 . fo Court hac air©ady issued a decree in a case of ^heildi Absaod A1 daber and others^ overlooking the fact that Kings and Head© of lowers if they themselves do not accept to enjoy these privileges, no one can compel them to do so a and that it was the duty of the Court itself to announce its incospetency to hear that case, especially that ouch privileges are the legitimate right agreed upon for the head of that Power. Ih© judgment previously issued in a case does not necessarily drop the right of the sair in insisting upon the privileges enjoyed in his capacity as the Head of an independent Btate. Moreover the defendant has expressed a readiness to turn out Sheikh A1 (labor A1 Sabah, lair of Koweit, from the case. In turning out Sheikh A1 Sabah from that case, this moons that we have gained a great benefit in that the plaintiff admits of tiie first reason regarding the inco^peUency of the Court to hear that case which also involves another admission i.o* that ordinary Courts have no right to issue a decree against certain persons whose relations with others fall within the competency of Interna tional treaties. Sine© we have mentioned International treaties and their authority with regard to disputes, and their conflletion with that of the Courts, it may be worthy to mention the opinion of certain legal authorities in that connexion at the head of whom is Xtaed Bey Fahmy, Counsellor in the gyptian Court of Cassation. Hamad Bey Fahmy referred to that question in a recent book of which he is the author and entitled ^Cassation in Civil and *1 Commercial hatters' and stated in paragraph 23 page 106 the following *Xt is agreed upon that whenever a troaty provides for a certain rule as laid down in Private International Law, it is the duty of the judge to ascertain - of hie own accord - of its existence and whether it is advisable or otherwise to be applied taking into consideration the circumstances of the case brought before him in so far as the litigants are concerned* He has the ri^bt to interpret it whenever it is necessary to /settleHis opinion In eottle the legal question under dispute* that case in subjected to the control of the Court of Caseation. It is also agreed upon that fjhenever a treaty concerns a question of Private International haw and sets forth rules *hich contravene the National Law, such a treaty must indicate the action which should be taken in case of conflict arising or otherwise. If the treaty provides for the action to be taken in the event of conflict taking place* the judge should act accordingly* failing this the Judge should follow the provisions of the treaty* -bach action should be taken if the treaty was issued after the law. If the treaty was Issued before the law* the judge should apply the provisions of the treaty* because the Power which issued a law cannot alone infringe the treaty without the previous consent of all Powers concerned* except throu^i the legal process stipula ted In General International aw. The judgment issued by the judge in this connexion is subject to the control of the Court of Cassation.’ Hanod Bey i'ahmy is not the only person who formed that opinion, but there are other legal authorities who share his views in this connexion* the first of them is X^ospagnet as laid down in his book on Private International l*aw page o2 of the third edition* and Oppert in his article entitled 'Interpretation of Political iMfttiee on the hearing of Cases'- published in the Hevlow of the rpocial International Baw of 18G9, page 433.' Turning to the case under reference after explaining these rules, we notice that there is m agreement between Great Britain and Keweit to the effect that the former guarantees to the latter its independence and protection* fhe also guarantees to the nir of oweit and his descendants* his property in Iraq* v e a i s0 noticed that there is mother treaty between Irak and Greet Britain organising the relations between the two Powers and containing a special provision making it incumbent /uponHi Hi •• 5 — upon each of the two Powers to respect the undertakings of the other, so long as they do not conflicfcwith the Covenant of the league of Nations or the act for the Prevention of ' ar* It vms agroed upon in that treaty that in the event of any difference arising with regard to the interpretation or the application, the natter he referred for arbitration to the league of Kations, If not settled in accordance with dlplomtic methods • Ihe agreement ref died between Great Britain and Irak, therefore, excludes the Courts from the interpretation and the application of the treaties and leaving it to diplomatic methods. If such methods proved a failure, the League of Nations has the right to decide the matter. r e have explained all this in our first V ote and it was accepted by the opponent in his last Hot® and by his agreeing to exclude Shol&amp;h Atoned AX Gaber AX Sabah from the case. The plaintiff wishes that the case should continue against the other defendant*, overlooking the fact that the agreement reached between Great Britain and Koireit in which Groat Britain undertook to guarantee to the Sheikh of Kov/eit and his sons their property in Basra, doe® not moan that such guarantee concerned Sheikh Tubarak A1 Sabah only, as plaintiff attested to establish, but that it involves also the Sheikh’s sons i.e. the remainder of the defendants ■herea* the plaintiff has admitted of the correctness of that rule with regard to Sheikh hmed A1 Sabah, he has tacitly addttod of the application of the rules of International taw. These rules involve the remainder of the defendants seeing that they have connexion with the agreement reached between Great Britain and fheikh Ahmed Al Sabah. vlnder these circumstances the repellence with regard to the incompetency of the Court to consider the present case is correct and based on sound grounds, from the point of view of law, the legal authorities and the Court’s rulings* We put forward other grounds of repellence in the case via /the lapse—(Si) •• 6 — the laps© of tlrae and asked for the non-hearing of the cane and mentioned in the course of ^rgumont that our ownership of the property was lawful, since It was purchased fron the testator of the plaintiff* In his last l ote the plaintiff Interpreted that st*'tenont as a recognition of his ownership, despite the lapse of tine and gave as evidence of his allegation in this connexion Article 1674 of the '^agallsh”* T% sliould therefore go back to the text of Article 1674 of the 'Bagallah* in order to ascertain the intention of the author of that text* Article 1674 of the f| ^agallah* s runs as follows?- nr 3w forfeiture of right cannot be effected by lapse of tine. There fore if the defendant clearly admits in the presence of the Courts that the plaintiff has an existing right in a case effected by prescription in the manner claimed by the plaintiff, no consideration should be given to the prescription and a decree should bo issued in accordance with the confession of the defendant*' -hie ie the text of the Article of '/a-iiagallah* which does not require any explanation* It also provides that the confeesion of the rl$it cl filmed sliould take place during the progress of the case* The annotator of the 'Vagallah” referred to that matter and gave examples in wliich he says:- existlng The word^is a precautionary restriction which mane that the confession of the defendant does not repel prescription except when h© admits of that right being under his security. It therefore follows that If a person claims a property alleged to b© In his ownership and inherited from his father and the defendant replies that he purchased it from the father or uncle, for a certain sum, and has possessed it for 40 years, no evidence is required her© in support of the purchase, but the only thing required iVom him is to prove his disposal of that property during that laps© of tine, because in claiming the purchase from /the father I547 - 7 * ^ the lather and mother of plaintiff, he did not admit of their ownership at preset, and therefore his confession cannot be rep oiled by tli© proscription* If we revert after this to the definition of the confession, a reference to this is made in Article 1532 of the 'H&amp;gflaiah* which runs as follows:-* °' f ; : 1 o : i 1 s a ■ ■ ac:i ov? 1 od ;or 5 h 1 by : a ;&gt; err on of u ri^it belonging to another, t!iorofore ho is callod tli© confessor, while the other is called the person confessed to, and the right, the acknowledged right. fter e^cplainlng these rules, w© have to rotum to what the plaintiff called tile acknowledged right* It appears that the pi - dintiff has not unddBitood ttio real fact or attec^ited ! * ~ ^ t£ic cov .11 tlint, wc c.-.id in tftnt v.&lt;o - chased that property and pi*oduced docunaits In support thereof, ihis rebuts the clain put forward by the plaintiff for tlio w/r.er- shlp of that property. therefore the prescription neither repels nor forfeits the statement made by us in this connexion. There now ren' ine the question of the legal excuse. The plaintiff appears to have differed fron us in the interpreta tion of the intermittent absence and gave as evidence of hie allegation the text of Articles 1463 and 1464. H e committed a niatnke in this and perhaps he wished to refer to articles 64- t/ll- Before discussing tbs previsions of two Articles, we consider it advisable to speak briefly chi the question of the excuses that repel the lapse of time. Vi* have now an epistle by i-aitro Zaki Khoir A1 Abu Seegi hey. President of the Parquet in the Civil Circle of the Court of Cassation, called 'Suspension of prescription for coepulsory reasons and incapacitated circumstances.

A person cannot be asked to do the tapes slble*” In reply to Eaudret end To sale* s allegation that the interest of the individual should be forfeited for public interest, the author points out that laws were intended for the conplet© sacrifice of the interest of the individual to the public benefit, but that the interest of the individual should also be taken into consideration* The author of the epistle then loft to reasons for the proscription for discussion of legal excuses, and dealt with the question of absence, pointing out on page 13 the following?- 'The question of absence ha© remained the nouree of difference of opinion in the Egyptian Courts, o?dng to the text of Article 15S of a book called ”1 urshed al Kayraan 0 ( A guide for the perplxed) which places absence with minority and lunacy, and considers it among legal excuses which prevents the progress of lapse of tine* /The authorTte author then expr^eaed his personal opinion with regard to the question of absence and stated on page 14 the following M Dietinctlon should be made in the case of absence between tvo tilings# If the absence is a eocsnon one, (ks* if an a person leaves for a certain known or^ciknown place and then returns) his absence in this case cannot prevent the progress of prescription, because it me possible for him to take the necessary neasores before his departure for the protection of his rights from forfeiture# J ven if he lives far away from hi© country, it is possible for him - in the existence of the present facilities agreed upon among the various Governments - to send a power of attorney to whoever represents him in claim ing his rights, failing this he rill be considered negligent* Prescription cannot be suspended in the presumption of negligence as already mentioned# An exceptional case should be allowed if the absentee suffered from a forced incident during his absence, such as captivity, the cutting of com unicetions, or the quarantine restrictions on account of pest, etc* In these cases the prescription cannot be operative for reasons of absence but for the forced incident which was not the result of any negligence# But if a person was caused to be absent by force, for example being deported from his ora country, such person shall not be excused if it was in his ability before hi© departure to appoint m Agent or ms, during his deportation. able to appoint a representative to file a suit claiming his right* The contrary is applied, if it has been proved that he was deported to a place where he could not appoint an Agent, or was in a state of absolute inability to do anything to maintain his right# Such a case is considered to be of a forced nature ishich warrants the suspension of prescription* according to Bharia ( i*&lt;3&gt;* Islamic Beligious Low «* translator) Authorities, where a person is held to be absent, hi® case, under Sharia Law comes under ore of tro heads, eithertvhere he anoints an Agent before his absence to maintain his property and odninister his affairs* or #xer© he has no Agent* In the latter case the Sharia judge appoints an Agent for hin# See Articles 572 and 573 in the book on ^sharia Rules regarding Personal rtatus by Kadrl Pasha* In both cases the prescription should be applied against bin* because the Agent represents him In the maintenance of his rights against forfeit* In the case of negligence on the part of the Agent* he himself or Ills heirs have grounds of action against the Agent* It my be spolnted out in objection to this that the prescription is not applied to the incapacitated for a guardian or attendant is appointed to administer his affairs and maintain his rights* In reply to this I have to say that the incapacitated lacks discrimination and cannot administer his orn affairs* if he finds his guardian or attendant negligent in maintaining his rights* hereforo the legislator has provided a special procedure for this* Ihe absentee of complete iacapacity and discrimination can administer his owi affairs and maintain his ova rights* If he appoint® an Agent, or such on Agent ie appointed by the Judge on his behalf* he has to undergo the consequences of his bod selection in the first place* and the non-administration of his om affairs ^hlch is a kind of neglicence and does warrant the suspension of the prescription.

The defendants have the honour to submit to the Court an oojection as to its jurisdiction and thus respectfully ask it to declare its incom petence, but before going in detail in this point, we feel it our duty to make indentify the parties, and particularly the defendants. All the defendants are the children and grand-children of Sheikh Mokarak Pasha A1 Sabbah ruler of A1 Kweit. One of them is H.H. Sheikh Ah mad A1 Gaber A1 Sabbeh the present ruler and Shir of Kweit. He is the head of an independent principality under the protection of Great Britain. The regime of this protectorate is a special agreement concluded between Great Britain and the principality of A1 Kweit on 3 rd.November 1914. This agree ment embodies Great Britain's guarantee to protect El Kweit as an independent principality. It was ruled by Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabbah who was succeeded by his grandson, H.H.Sheikh Ahmad El Gaber El Sabbah one of the defendants. Fur thermore this agreement states the Great Britain shall preserve for the ruler of A1 Kweit Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabbah, and for his children and grand children after him, their estates in Basra,enumerated one by one and amongst which ap pears the Fada^hiya estate. What is the position of the defendants in this case from the legal point of view in this light ?2 3G&gt; (§) It has been previously mentioned that the Kv/eifc principality v&lt;as placed under Great Britain’s protection under the terms of the agreement with H.H. Sheikh El Kwiet. In accordance with the principles of Public International Law,that protection necessarily leads to the prevention of the agression of i any foreign power on A1 Kweit principality. But this protection is of a spe cial kind, for the agreement concluded between Great Britain and A1 Kweit embodies in addition to the general obligations derived from the principles of public international law, other special obligations, especially that re lating to the guarantee of Great Britain to preserve for H.H.Sheikh A1 Kweit his properties at Basra,including the Fadaghiya estate. Great Britain, has therefore become a guarantor to A1 Kweit, and espe cially to the House of the Ruler of A1 Kweit,Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabbah and to his children and grand-children, in their properties in the Basra Province. One of the principles of international Law is that the guarantor state has the right to intervene if another state tries by means of any of the Govern ment authorities therein to tamper with what that state guarantor has gua ranteed to the state guaranteed. The question of the legality of interven tion is one of the most intricate and complicated problems of international lav/, especially as it has not been adequately dealt with in Literature; and to go back to international precedents is useless, not only because nations adopt different principles, but because the same power may act in a certain manner on one occasion, and in a totally different manner on another similar occasion; no rule can therefore be deduced from the several incidents that history lias recorded. In the present instance we must have recourse to the fundamental princi ples of independence tied with protection. Intervention 5^ most cases takes the form of a diplomatic measure which is not at all void of transgression on justice. But in exceptional cases it may be a lawful right, although its exercice leads to a departure from moral obligations. Such is the case of intervention to assert a right laid down by treaty or by international rules, as for instance in the case of the interven tion of a state that has guaranteed the integrity of the possessions of anotherstate,its ruling house, or any particular system of government therein. There are numerous cases of intervention recorded in history. As an instance may be quoted the intervention of the U.S. in Cuba in 1903 which took place in accordance with the Havana Treaty of 1903 which gave to the U. S. the right to intervene in order to maintain the independence of Cuba, under an organized government that protects life,property and inviolability. The present case is therefore one between the state of Great Britain as guarantor of the Kweit Ruler possessions and the Iraq Government in its capacity ss responsible for the rights of all individuals enjoying its so vereignty. In asserting that the case is in fact one between Great Britain and the Iraq Government v/e base this assertion on the guarantee which Great Britain has taken on herself towards the Kweit principality,to preserve those properties which are the subject of the present case. It remains for us to examine the relations that have arisen between Great Britain and the Iraq Government and to see whether they could allow the ordinary courts in Iraq to decide such a case, or under the circumstances that could not enter within their competence. //ar was declared against Turkey on the 5 th.of November 1914. Iraq was then a Turkish Wilaya. English troops occupied Basra Province on the 6 th.of November 1914 and in view of that occupation assumed all the rights of govern ment in the territory occupied. The British Occupation continued from that time up to 1922 when a treaty v/as c on eluded with Iraq. Subsequently another treaty of alliance was conclu ded between the two countries in 1926. Finally a third treaty of alliance was concluded between them under the title of ’’Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq'. That treaty embodied the followihg agreement in Clause Seven :- 'This treaty replaces the two treaties of alliance signed at Baghdad on the lOth.of Tishrin first 1922 A.D.,I0th. Safar 1341 Hegriya and on I 6 th.Kanoun Second 1926 - 28th. Goraad second 1344 Hegriya together with supplementary agreements appended thereto which become nul and void the moment this treaty comes into operation'.4 C$n) ^ The 1930 treaty has therefore become the only one in force,annulin£; the other treaties concluded before, between Great Britain and Iraq. This treaty embodies an express text binding the Iraq Kingdom to respect any pledge given by England to a third party so long as such pledge is not contrary to the Pact of the League of Nations or the 'Prohibition of infer'. That statement embodied in the IS30 Treaty to that effect is the fol lowing Clause 9 : 'This treaty contains nothing that is intended in any way to affect the rights or obligations that either party has or may have in accordance with the League of Nations Pact or the Prohibition of Yfer Treaty signed at Paris on 27th. Aab 1928'. Vie may conclude from the above that Great Britain and Iraq have entered into an alliance of friendship which entails that neither party shall do any thing that may injure the other, impair its interests at home or abroad, or its relations with other powers. The treaty also embodied a condition that the Iraq Kingdom shall respect the obligations or Great Britain, It has been previously mentioned that Great Britain has pledged to preserve for the Kweit Principality her properties in Basra including the Eadaghiya as explicitely specified. The matter does not stop at that. The 1930 Treaty embodies a clause which outlines the method of settling any controversy that may arise between the two parties regarding the interpretation or the application of the trea ty. The following is an extract from Clause IC 'If any difference arises in the application or interpretation of this treaty and the two contracting parties fail to arrive at a settlement by direct negotations with one another such difference will be dealt with in accordance with the League of Nat ion*s Pact'- ^ - mis very clause places the present case outside the jurisdiction of courts in the Iraq Kingdom. For the present case,as previously stated,has originated merely, in that certain individuals of Iraq suing a foreign prin~ cipality - the Kv/eit Principality - for some of its properties in Iraq. That principality is under the protection of Great Britain who is also a guarantor ci its properties in Basra. Great Britain’s guarantee or obligation should not, in accordance with Clause 5 of the treaty of alliance concluded between Great Britain and Iraq, be affected by that treaty. The question is therefore one of interpretation and application of the treaty and it has been agreed that such interpretation and application are cutsiciG the jurisdiction of ordinary courts, as in accordance with Clause 10 l : -&amp;y are left, to negotiations between the two parties, end if they fail to reach a settlement the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the League of na tions' Pact. The League ffcct,which has made a point of regulating the relations bet ween o..e nations signatories to it, makes provision for such cases as the pre sent one. It is stipulated in Clause 16 of the League Pact that M Members of the League agree that whenever a dispute arises between them which is amenable to settlement by arbitration and the dispute is not settled to a satisfactory end by di plomatic means,they shall submit the whole dispute to arbi tration'. Among the disputes that are amenable to settlement by arbitration may be counted,those connected with the interpretation of a treaty,any question of in ternational lav/, the proving of any incident which if proved constitutes a breach of an international obligation and the amount and kind of compensation for such a breach. In addition to the preceding, one of the defendants is H.H.Sheikh Ahmad A1 Caber A1 Sabbah. The Iraq Government recognises the fact that he is the ru ler of an independant principality,under the protection of Great Britain. In virtue of his post and his position which the Iraq Government recongnises, he6 Las all the international privileges allowed to Kings and heads of nations, he should not be sued in person,nor sued before an ordinary court. Any dis pute that may arise between him and any nation,or any individuals of any nation must be settled by dip lores tic means. It may be objected that the present case deals with private property owned by oheikh El Kweit t in Basra, and that he owns it not in his capacity as Sheikh El Kweit, but as an ordinary individual. But this argument is of no value, for H.H, Sheikh El Kv/eit is the head of an independant principality and if he should go to another country and own property there, he cannot be considered to have given up his personality as the ruler of an independent prin- ciplaity, Moreover, as previously stated, Great Britain has guaranteed to Sheikh A 1 Kv/eit and to his children and grand children their properties in Basra, and Great Britain has given him that guarantee not as an ordinary individual but as a state with all the privileges that all states enjoy in their relations with one another. The case derives its international nature from the guarantee that Great Britain has given to Sheikh A1 Kweit for this property in Basra,if not from the personality of Sheikh A1 Kv/eit. It is on ihe ground of that international nature of the case that we assert that it does not come within the jurisdiction of this court,firstly in view of the public position of the defendants,second ly in view of Great Britain’s guarantee, and thirdly in view of the terms of the treaty of alliance concluded between Great Britain and Iraq in 1930,and particularly clauses 9 and 10 of that Treaty. Prescription for Lapse of Time Before dealing with the question of prescription, we wish to lay before the court, the legal rules which govern prescription for lapse of time. It should be noted that in most laws,rights are forfeited with the lapse of time. The Mohamedan Law however, in accordance with which the laws of Iraq have been drawn up, does not allow rights to be forfeited through lapse of time; but the lapse of time bans the hearing of the Case,(Vic) 36* - 7 - 1 h, Article 166 of A 1 Magalle cays H The following cases cannot be heard : if left for fifteen years Cases of debt, deposits on trust, inheritance, property (immobilier), or cases that do not to the public if they are not related to the origin of the v/aqf.' The late Selim Rustom Baz el Libnani made the follov/ing comments on that article. To sum up, no case whatever if neglected for fifteen years without excuse, shall be heard,unlesc it is one regarding the origin of a waqf.Should the judge hear it and pronounce judgement,his judgement shall not be put into force,for he is barred from hearing the case. To make the natter clearer,the following examples are given : (l) If a person claims a property which another inherited from his father who had died 15 years earlier, his case shall not be heard if he confesses that the property has been in the possession of the defendants since the death of plaintiff's father, or if that is proved by evidence'. This is the view of the commenter on A1 ?,!agalla. Nor is he alone in that view. Egyptian courts uphold the same viev/ and the court of Cassation has de livered several sentences all of which support the statement we have imde. It delivered sentence on the I 8 th.April 1935 in which it stated : 'In Mohanraedan Law,neglect which bans the hearing of a case,means the neglect of making the legal claim for a property in spite of the existence of a motive for making that claim when a second par ty has appropriated the property,trespassed thereon, and denied the rights of the owner thereto'. This rule is worded in the following manner in Art 375 of the regulations in force in the Mahkamas El Shar'iya 'Judges are barred from hearing cases which are fifteen years over due, if plaintiff had been able to submit them and has no legal excuse for not having done so, except in cases of inheritance and waqf,where the period after which the cases cannot be heard is36 ^ /'-N r \ 0 - thirty three years, in the absence of legal excuse; provided in all cases that the right of the owner was during the period'. 'But the mere desertion or neglect of the property no matter for how long a pe riod if no one interferes with it,appropriates it and denies the right of the owner thereto,does not at all either in Mohammedan Law or in any other law en tail the loss of that right or prevent the hearing of the case regarding it if anyone should interfere with it after the long period of neglect.' This is not the sole judgement that the Egyptian Court of Cassation has pronounced. It has delivered other judgments to the same effect. Among these are two judgements delivered on 23rd.April 1936. All these judgments support the view given above. The most important reference that these judgments make in accordance with the rule of Mohammedan Law is that the person who has appropriated the property may submit a transcription for lapse of time to prevent the hearing of the case even though he may have appropriated the property by force. Maitre Shakir El Hanbali upholds the same view in his work entitled 'Su mary of the Rules of Lands and Immobile property' p.p.97 and after. But he differs with the judgment of the Egyptian Court of Cassation as regards the ground on which the property is appropriated. He says in paragraph 40, Page 102 'The person in possession of property whether freehold,or waqf, cannot defend a claim made on the property merely on the ground of lapse of time without producing a legal document, and the hearing of the case cannot be prevented'. 'But in regard to Govt, and Baqf properties it is not necessary to produce the legal document and the contention of the lapse of time is sufficient'. On page 103 of the same book he says 'Similarly if the defendant who is in possession in cases of dealing with freehold or waqf properties confesses in the pre sence of the governor that he had taken the property over from the plaintiff or made his dealings in the property in the pre sence of the plaintiff for a period of fifteen years, the lapse of this time shall not prevent the hearing of the case. The9 - defendant should prove the sale or which he claims. In cases of Govt .or .7aqf lands,which are the natter is different.” This is the view of TIaitre Shakir 121 Hanhali which is at variance with that held by the Egyptian Court of Cassation as to the ground for appropria tion. The Court of Cassation holds that the ground may be force, and if it continues for fifteen years, while the claimant is able to submit his legal claim to the property and yet does not do so, this will prevent the case fro ' being heard after the lapse of fifteen years during which the property was held by force. But Maitre Shakir El Hanhali holds that the ground for the apnroprda tion must be a lawful one. Yet another savant, Maitre Ali Haidar ETfendi, upholds the view of the Egyptian Court of Cassation, in regard to the rule it has adopted from Moha mmedan Law concerning the ground for appropriation, for he makes no distinction between freehold land, government land or waqf land, and says that the claimant basing his claim on lapse of time is not compelled to give the grounds on which he took possession, no matter what the kind of land is. (Please refer to margin of page 103 of the v/ork previously to). 7/e find no authority for the statement which El Banbali lays down that the ground of appropriation, must be lawful, we contend that the cause for transcription for lapse of time is the neglect or desertion of the claimant to the property. This desertion or ne glect entails the lose of the right to the property. Y/e also contend that if Maitre Hanbali is right in laying down the condition that the ground for the appropriation must be lawful,there will be no need to make a transcription for lapse of time since if the ground for the appropriation is lav/ful,it will suffice in itself to contest the claim for the property. The Iraq Court of Cassation however,holds a view which is halfv/ay bet ween the two preceding views. It ras.de the following rule in case 25I/I900 which was published in Magallet El Adliya Part 4,Year 2,page 100 :- Prescription for lapse of time shall not be Bieard in regard to officially registered property,unless the prescription for lapse311 - io - of time is supported by a written document of ownership, as a ground for possession'. After explaining these views and giving these qoutations which concern the rule of lapse of time we return to the facts of the present case in order to see whether these facts as stated in the writ of the case, and as substan tiated by documents,permit the hearing of the case or if the Court is barred from the hearing for the lapse of 15 yeras. Plaintiff says in the writ,that he inherited from his aunt Awasha Hanem Bint Abdalla A1 Zohair one third of the whole palm plot at Fada^hiya A1 Faw Village, registered in the Itebo in her name under Nos.94,95,96 and 97 dated Kanoun Tani. 32 permanent, and Nos.II and 12 dated August 1915 permanent. He has for support, a legal document dated 31st.Kanoun First 1931, and the regis ters ( ) of the lbbo mentioned above. He says that defendants have been in possession o: the property and taken to contesting his right to it. He also says that Hamad and Abdalla sons of Sheikh Mubarak El Sabbah, and that Ca ber, Salem,and Nasir sons of Sheikh Mubarak A 1 Sabbah whom the other defendants inherited,procured by illegal means illegal documents in their names, fromthe registration records under Nos,13,14,15,16,17 and 18 dated August ISIS. This atetement of the plaintiff comprises two paragraphs :- Firstly that the defendants deny his right to the props rty and Secondly that this denial started according to his statement in August 1915. On referring to the date of the writ we note that he introduced his case and claimed this property on the 20th.Tishreen Awal 1932,that is, the defendants remained in possession of the property for a period of more than 15 years, 'which is the period neces sary to prevent the hearing of the case. On referring to the dated SIst.Kanoun Awal 1921 we find it assert the death of Aiehc Pint Abdalla A1 Zoheir whom the plaintiff inherited two months before the i.e. her death took place on 21st.Tishreen Awal 1931. Between the date on which, as the lawyer of the plaintiff supposes in the writ, the defendants took possession of the property and the date on which Ai- sha A1 Zohair died there is a space of over 15 years, which is the legal period after which the case cannot be beard. The right of. the hearing of the case had therefore been lost before the death of the decudjus and the estate passed to theheirs of Aisha Kanera A 1 Zohair including the plaintiff,devoid of the right to submit the present case. The case is therefore submitted by a person who has no legal right to submit it. If v/e examine the facts of the case in the light of the different views which dealt with the ground of possession, we find that ail the different views lead to the same result i.e, the case should not be heard. If we assume that the defendants took possession of the property by for ce, the hearing of the case is banned for lapse of time, as the plaintiff says in the writ served to the defendants that the date of their possession is Au gust 1915. If on the other hand we assume that the defendants must have le gal justification for possession in accordance with the view of Ilaitre Shakir El Hanbali and the decision of the Iraq Court of Cassation referred to pr evious- ly, we find that the plaintiff confesses in the writ that the defendants pro cured with regard to this property registration documents in their names,dated August 1915 and registered under Nos,13,14,15,16,17 and 18 permanent. Plaintiff says that these documents are not legal, but we do not agree there. Although there is no need at present to enter into a discussion of this point. ,«e say that the Court of Cassation in its decision in case 25I/IS25 published in Bagailet El Adliya year 2 - page IOC says ' It is not essential that the docuwamt for possession shall be legal,i.e.fully conforming to the lav/; all that that decision stipulated to enable the person in possession to make a transcription for lapse of time,is that possession must be justified on any of the grounds of ownership by means of a written document”. That the documents of the defendants are such written documents,the plain tiff himself confesses in the writ; nay it is confirmed by the documents we submit with this Laiha which are all written documents proving that the defen dants took possession of the property from 1909,morever,the condition laid down by the Court of Cassation in 1925,that possession must be justified on the ground of ownership by means of a v/ritten document has been cancelled by that same court in 1926, as it has decided that force may be a ground for posses sion which if it lasts for 15 years,prevents the hearing of the case. Here is373 - 12 - the wording of the judgment as published in Ifagallet El Qada,second year issues Nos,3 and 4 on page 426,file N,597/1936 H If the plaintiff subnits a case asking that the defendant be prevented from interfering with her in a house she owns, and confesses that defendant had taken the house by force 18 years before and added it to his own house, her case must be refused because that period is longer than the period of lapse of time”. In elucidation of this rule the Court of Cassation said 'The Court of first instance at Solimaniya pronounced a contra dictory judgment on 2nd.3haoat 1936,File N,46/1936 refusing the case of the plaintiff which she had submitted requesting that defendant to be prevented from interfering with her in the house at Ifehallet Kweiya, and making her beat the cost of the proceedings. The sauid plaintiff appealed to have the judgment annuled as she was not satisfied with it. After pe rusing all the documents of the case and examining carefully all the arguments,it has been found that the house forming the subject of this ca.se has not been registered in the Tabo of- fi ce ( )and that the defendant has submitted a transcription that he has been in uncontested possession of the said house for a period exceeding the lapse of time period The plaintiff confessed in the setting of 26th.Qanoun Thani 1936 that the defendant had taken possession of the said house by force, and had added it to his house, eighteen years before, •ith this confession of the plaintiff : plaintiff’s transcrip tion is proved - that he had been in possession for a period exceeding the lapse of time period. The first judgment appealed against, refusing plaintiff’s case and changing her with costs is therefore in accordance with law, and the objections raised by plaintiff are irrelevant. Her appeal is therefore hereby13 @ 37tf refused, and the judgment appealed against confirmed and plaintiff charged with costs of the appeal. This decision has been given unanimously on Sth.Sofar 1355 (29th.Nisan 1936)”. Some writers contend that lapse of time can be proved by witnesses,while others contend that if defendants* document is in complete conformity with legal requirements, evidence against it cannot be accepted. Those latter who say that evidence against an official document is not acceptable mix up two things. The first is that this evidence does not deal with the subject of the documents or the statements made therein. The second is that that evidence deals with a material point which has nothing to do 'with the document,namely the possession by the defendants of the property contested for 15 years. This mixing up is probably due to the rule that evi dence against deeds is not permissible not being properly understood. That group of writers may have got mixed up because paragraph 2 of Art 30 of states the following H A case against a document concerning privates dealing must be proved by or by the confession of the defendant or by his account book oven if it does not exceed P.T.1,000'. For the wording of this means that in a case submitted on the strenght of a written document, a defendant may not be allowed to prove the contrary of the written document by v/itnesses. But our present case is totally diffe- rent,a3 there is no need between us and the plaintiff which this latter wishes to enforce by judgment and which we wish to prove its contrary by v/itnesses. The position we are in is that he claims ownership,and we say that he has wi thout excuse neglected the claim to this property,which he says he owns, for a period which prevents his case from being heard, and we therefore deny him the right to have his case heard. There is a tremendous difference between the text of Art 80 of and the prescription we are claiming. V/e are not trans cribing the deed to which the plaintiff adheres; nor do we arish to prove the opposits of what that deed says; but we merely say that a period of time has elapsed which prevents the hearing of his case, and give this as evidence of the lapse of time.- 14 - The rule mentioned in paragraph two of Art 80 of the is the same rule embodied in Art 1341 of the French Civil Code. Fron what was has proceeded,it is clear that the prescription for lapse of time is a thoroughly sound one,and should in justice and in law be accepted,and the case of the plaintiff should be dismissed on this ground. This is not the only exception we raise regarding the lapse of time, V/e raise also another exception based on Indian Law for lapse of time also These properties were registered in the name of the defendants in accor dance with an order issued by the Finance Inspector (Sir Henry Doyce) on I4th, /-V Heziran 1915 N.504. That inspector was at the same time the Inspector Gene ral of Ifebo, and the order he issued was an order from competent officer of the Government. A case requesting the concellation of such an order must, in view of paragraph 14,Art I Part I,Indian Law of lapse of time, be submitted within one year from the issue of the decision. The following is the exact wording of the Art M I4~ To abolish any act or decision emanating from a govern ment officer in his official capacity and not mentioned here in a special place”, ^ As cases abolished ( ) by the application of the Indian lapse of time Law cannot be renewed after the abolition of the said law, in accordance with the rules of abolition of Basra Laws,1920,which state the following ' All cases abolished for lapse of time before executing these rules cannot be resubmitted ob account of the abo lition of the indian lapse of time law'. As the present case was not submitted before Hrziran I9IG,ail right to submit it has been forfeited,from that date and the court cannot hear it for the foregoing reason.AS FOR THE OBJECT OF THE CASE IN ITSELF The subject of dispute in the present case is a property at Fadaghiya (Faw Village). The whole of that property is ov/ned and registered in the Basra Ttebo Office in the names of the five sons of Sheikh Mobarak A1 Sabbah Caber,Salem,Nasir,Hamad and Abdulla under Nos. 3,9,10,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,52,53,59,78,79,80 and 81 permanent. A1 Fadaghiya includes a bank,which is the property of Sheikh El Kweit built on a parcel of land reclaimed. This from the river. The Sheikh spent an enormous sum of money for erecting dams to protect it,and 'I/iadawin'* to make it suitable for planting palms. When the bank has been completely seve red from the river,the Sheikh will have the right to buy it at the price of equivalent land in accordance with the law. Sheikh El Kweit acquired ownership of these properties through buying a pa rt from Ali Bey El Moahri, a part from Ahmad Pasha A1 Zohair in his capa city of agent for his wife Aisha Hanem El Zohair,and part from Sheikha Hanem wife of Abdel V&amp;hab Pasha A1 Kirtas. The present case concerns-only the part sold by Abdel ,&amp;hab Pasha A1 Kirtas in his capacity as agent for Ahmad Pasha A1 Zohair,agent for his v/ife Aisha Hanera A1 Zohair, to the late Sheikh Moharak A1 Sabbah and registered in the names of his sons in the Tabo Office under Nos 13,14,15,16,17 and 18 in August 1915. Tlie deed for the dispute property was signed on 2lst.Moharram 1327 He- griya,and the following are the most important points in that deed ' I- The deed says at the beginning :-**I,Abdel V/ahab A1 Kirtas, sell in accordance with my power of procuration mentioned above, to the said H.E.Sheikh Mobarak A1 Sabbah the property of my 'Mirwakkilah** which has been in her possession up to the time of this deed - all the plots of land including trees and palms together with the Mahawil,all of which are situated in Badaghiya Qada el Fa\v,Liwa' El Basra,and which need no definition by giving limits as they are well known by name/ ' 377 16 and locality', '2-In the text of the deed the following is stated 'The whole price for this sale is forty four thousand,two hundred and seven teen Ottoiiian liras (pounds) and thirty three and a half piastres all of vhich I have received in cash and cheques. All the plots under palms and mehawil mentioned above have therefore become the property of Sheikh Mobarak Pasha A1 Saobah, who may enjoy all the rights of ownership without contest or opposition and from this date the name of my above mentioned liuwakkilah regis tered with this property in the Sultanic register becomes an assumed name, and the registration becomes no longer of any value as the real owner and legitimate possessor of the above mentioned lands is the said H.E,Mubarak Psha El Sabbah. Viy Muwakkilah has ceased to have any right over the said plots; I take the engagement to take the necessary action whenever I am asked so to do to have the property registered in the Sultanic register Office at Basra under the name of the said H.E.Sheikh Mobarak A1 Sabbah or under any name he my order'. ' 3 The deed concluded as follows :~ 'Delay in taking the said action shall not in any way cause the The deed was witnessed by twenty persons,all great notables and weal thy people of Basra, and among them many manbers of the Zohair Family and particularly Eisa Ibn Atdalla A1 Zohair Father of the plaintiff in the pre sent case, and brother of the seller Aisha Hanem A1 Zohair de-cudjus of the plain tiff, On 20th.Rabi* A1 Awal L328 Hegriya Abdel ’//ahab Pasha A1 Kirtas wrote a letter to H.E.Sheikh Mubarak Pasha A1 Sabbah which it is interesting to reproduce here :- 'His Excellency My Uncle Sheikh Mubarak Pasha A1 Sabbah' breach of the terms of this contract'</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00018e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2856</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00018e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2856</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/8(4) 'Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens: litigation in Iraq Courts regarding the Faddaghiyah estate'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-08-10T22:23:27</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (591 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 592; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
