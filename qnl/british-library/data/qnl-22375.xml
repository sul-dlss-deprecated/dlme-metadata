Dear Sir Rupert, It is understood that the ruler of I r alba has moved the aperture in the frontier wall through which the traffic parses between Kalba and ’Oman so thq.t it is better commanded by one of his posts, who will the more easily levy transit dues. The Sultan has no objection to paying dues but does object to changes being made in the frontier wall without his being consulted. He has sent someone up there to find out exactly what has happended; he may them write to us about is. As yet this is only an unofficial approach; but he may raise the question when you come here next week. T am a cording sending a copy of this letter to Y/ilton, in case he has any comments. 2. I realise that ve do not recognise the ruler of Kalba, so we can hardly accept responsibility for his acts. If the Sultan speaks to me before you arrive, T shall be non-committal. Yours sincerely, J.

When I saw W/ilton at Abu Dhabi on the 26th November he told me that on previous occasions when he or his predecessor had consulted the Trucial Coast Rulers on any matter without Abu Dhabi being included they had always made his absence an excuse for refusing to make any recommendation. I accordingly asked Shaikh Shakhbut whether he would be willing to attend' such meetings generally and with particular reference to the Kalba question and he replied in the affirmative. In these circumstances the phrase ’’except Abu Dhabi” should be omitted in paragraph 1 of my letter No. 10112/47 of November 23rd about Kalba.■f * 2 2-/6 42./b/^jt 1 1 2 / 50 .

There was no unanimity but there was some tendency to recommend that Sultan bin Salim should be put in as Ruler. Ras al Khaimah was in favour of this as it would relieve them of the necessity of paying an allowance to Sultan. If the Jawasim eventually make a definite recommendation in favour of Sultan, /ilton proposes to ask them what suggestions they have to make regarding the disposal of his son Saqr. His own idea is that he should be exiled for some period, possibly at Bahrain, and I think that if Sultan is eventually put into Kalba we will have to endeavour to arrange that Saqr is debarred from the succession.WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY BRITISH RESIDENCY, cAo BAHRAIN, 6th December, 1 • ' PERSIAN GULF.10112/48. CONfflDBNTIAI* British Besldeney, Bahrain. 6th December, 1951. I have been considering the possibility or announcing either that the Shallchdom of Kalba has reverted to Sharjah or that we no longer regard It ao an Independent Sheikhdom In treaty relations with Hls Ilajesty 1 ^ Oovenxment, and have been examining the history of the shnikhdom. I enclose a note I have recorded on the aubject. So far as I am aware there are no special facilities which we require in the sheikhdom and I do not think that Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) are particularly interested in it from the point of view of oil. I am not at present recocmending either of the courses of action referred to at the beginning of this letter but you may find it useful to have the enclosed note on record. I propose to await the result of Vilton’s consultations with the Jawasim family, c.f. ray letter No. 10112/41 of October 30th and have also suggested to him that he should sunmon a Council of the Trucial Coast Rulers (excluding Abu Etiabi) to consider the matter. (W.R. Hay) R.F.G. Sarell, Bsq., Eastern Department, Foreign Office, S.W # 1 #Copy of a note recorded by His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain on the 26th November, 1951* of NOTE ON THE SHAIKH DOM OF KALBA . The 'great' Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah before his death in 1866 divided his country amongst his four sons as follows: Salim - Ras al Khaimah. Majid - Kalba. Ahmad - Diba. Khalid Sharjah. Ras al Khaimah has from time to time been recognised by H.M.G. as independent of Sharjah and consistently so since 1921. Diba has never been recognised as independent but has been regarded as part of Kalba since that Sheikhdom became independent. 2. Kalba though in fact more or less independent of Sharjah f° r many years was never recognised as such until 193&amp; when we required certain facilities for aircraft there. The Ruler of Sharjah was unable to obtain these for us and accordingly on the 28th August, 1936 we recognised Shaikh Sa’id, the grandson of Majid, as independent and entered into treaty relations with him. We also on the same day entered into an agreement with him for providing facilities for aircraft at Kalba'. This agreement expired in 1948 and has not been renewed. 3a id died in an his minor son Hamad was accepted by the people of Kalba as his successor. They subsequently accepted Khalid bin Ahmad as Regent during his minority. Hamad on attaining his majority took over as Ruler in 1950 and on the 5th July, 1951 was murdered by Saqr bin Sultan bin Salim of the Ras al Khaimah branch of the family. It is believed that with the murder of Hamad the Kalba branch of the family has become extinct in the male line. 3. In 1928 Petroleum Concessions Limited (now Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast.)) obtained a concession from the Regent of Kalba under which they paid him Rs. 24,000 annually. While Hamad was Ruler they paid to him Rs. 3»5pO per quarter and as a result of an agreement which he signed, of A , , Rs. 2,500 as a sort of pension to the ex-Regent Khalid bin Ahmad. Since Hamad* s death the quarterly payment to the Ruler has been suspended and the money kept in deposit in the bank, but the payment to Khalid has continued.^t/i ' t'.'93/53. CONFIDENTIAL P'^?7 British Residency, Bahrain. 6 th December, 1951 In your letter No. 0.41/1/47/51 of the 18th November you have discussed the disposal of a sum of Rs. 3&gt;0 j0 which tne nank (at Dubai ? ) holds in the name of the late Shaikh Hamad of Kalba. As pointed out in my letter No. 1011 2/48 of the 6th December, 1951 sums due to the Ruler of Kalba from Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) under their oil concession are also held in deposit in the bank and it is possible that a portion of this may have accrued before Hamad 1 s death and be oherexore available for payment to heirs or creditors. In the primitive conditions prevailing in Kalba I am inclined to think that any money of Hamad’s must be regarded as his personal property and not that of the State. In such circumstances we have, strictly speaking, no jurisdiction over it and it could only be paid out on the basis of an order by a competent Shar’a Court. I do not know if there is a Qadhi at Kalba but, even if there is, in the present circumstances it is unlikely that we could obtain an impartial decree from him. I am therefore of opinion that all money in the bank due to Hamad should be held there pending further developments, and Vilton may be instructed to advise the bank accordingly. In any case it would no^, I imagine, pay the money out except under the direction of a competent Court or of the Political Officer. (W.R. Hay) W. S.

I was aware that the suggestion I made that the Trucial Council should be consulted about the Kalba situation conflicted somewhat with my previous instruction that the matter should be discussed with the Jawasim family, and I intended to speak to you on the subject. You will see that in my letter 10112/41 of the 30th October I suggested that Wilton should be M in constant touch” with members of the Jawasim family and it is for him to decide whether to talk to them en bloc or individually. I think that he should take up the matter with the family in this manner £irst, and that if, as is probable, they fail to find an acceptable solution he should summon a meeting of all the Trucial Coast Rulers except Abu Dhabi. The non-Jawasim Rulers may have useful suggestions to make and may be able to use their influence to bring about a satisfactory settlement. 2. I forwarded to the Foreign Office a copy of my letter 10112/41 of the 30th October to you and they were rather horrified at the suggestion that Sultan bin Salim might be accepted as Ruler of Kalba in the place of his son. I enclose a copy of a letter from Furlonge on • the subject. I am not at all keen on putting Sultan in myself but fear that if we put anybody else in we may find ourselves conmitted to maintaining him by force. 3 # a possible solution would be to announce that as the branch of the Jawasim to which the late Shaikh Hamad belonged has become extinct we regard Kalba as having reverted to the Sheikhdom of Sharjah of which it formed a part until thirty or forty years ago. This would place on the Ruler of Sharjah the burden of getting rid of the usurper if he could find the means of doing so. One result of such action would presumably be that Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) would become legally bound to pay to the Shaikh of Sharjah Rs.24,000 due annually to the Ruler of Kalba under their Kalba agreement. This would be a welcome addition to the Sharjah revenues, but I do not imagine that the company would like the idea of paying the Ruler of Sharjah the money when he is not in a position to enforce their rights under the agreement. 4. Incidentally Lermitte tells me that the company are still paying Rs.2,500 per quarter to the ex-Regent of Kalba, Shaikh Khalid out of* the money due to the Ruler of Kalba under their concession. When Shaikh Hamad was given his powers he agreed that the ex-^egent should be paid this. Since Hamad*s assassination the company have ceased making the quarterly payment of Rs.3,500 to /him but have continued the payment to Khalid. With Hamad’s death his agreement to the payment of Rs.2,500 quarterly to Khalid is presumably no longer valid, and it is for consider ation whether we should advise the company to stop the payment. I should be grateful for your views on this point. Personally I should be sorry to see Khalid deprived of the income, and there is perhaps no reason why we should go out of our way to warn the company that they are not bound to make it. Lermitte is as a matter of fact aware as a result of his conversation with me that I have some doubts on the matter. Cax 5 # i am sending a copy of this letter to Wilton, discuss the case with him if I meet him at Abu Dhabi. I shall probably W. S. Laver, Esq., The Political Agent, Bahrain.MH li (ea 10111/3) CONFIDENTIAL COPY FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 1 ifth November, 1951. Dear Sir Rupert, I appreciate the difficulty in finding a suitable successor to the late Shaikh Hamad of Kalba, explained in your letter Nol 10112/42 of the 30th October. 2. When Saqr bin Sultan is finally evicted however it will be essential to show the other Trucial Coast Shaikhs, as well as the people of Kalba, that murder and unlawful usurpation of thrones are utterly opposed to the prinpiples which we consider should prevail throughout the States. 3. You have suggested Sultan bin Salim as a possible Ruler in place of his usurper son Saqr. In view of the wholly discreditable past history of the Sultan as well as the fact that he is so closely related to Sqqr, his recognition would not, I feel, impress the other Shaikhs sufficiently with the extent to which we condemn the crime and the method of its perpetration. &amp;. I should be glad to know therefore the result of the consultations with other members of the Jawasim family which Wilton is to have and also any further suggestions which you may have as regards other possible successors. If Sultan bin Salim remains the only possible person I should like to give further consideration to the case here before any action is taken towards recognising him as Ruler since I am doubtful whether we could approve such a proposal. 5 . I am anxious that Saqr should not be allowed to remain too long in Kalba and I agree with your directions in paragraph 2 of your letter to Laver No. 10112/4.1 of 30th October, that the strongest possible pressure should be brought to bear on him and that a more forceful course of action should now be planned.
