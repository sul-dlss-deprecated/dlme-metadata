Packer, Esq., Manager, Qatar &amp; Trucial Coast Operations, Petro leum Development Limited, Manama, Bahrain. You will recall that some time ago I spoke with you in regard to my instruction from the Department of State and from the U.S. Petroleum Attache at Cairo, requiring me to submit reports in regard to petroleum resources, developments in petro leum production and marketing, and petroleum forecasts in this consular district. Because of the great interest of many branches of the United States Government in this subject, I am instructed to make these reports as detailed and as exhaustive as possible, consisting in: 1. An initial report on sMfcxiHadbig outstanding current petroleum problems. 2. Special reports on important developments at the time they arise. 3. Regular monthly reports on development of current problems, general items, and pertinent statistics. 4. Annual reports (or termination report on departure of the reporting officer) analyzing the problems of the preceding year (or period) and discussing probable future trends and developments. I mentioned to you at that time that since Petroleum Development, Ltd., a 23.75$ share of which is owned by American interests, is now about to begin drilling and active development of its Qatar field; and since it is also planning further active surveys in the Trucial Coast and possibly other regions where it holds concession, I wished to submit direct to you the outline questionnaire transmitted to me by the petroleum Attache at Cairo, giving the types of information desired by the United States Government. You stated that you would transmit this questionnaire to your London headquarters, requesting instructions as to your reply to me. The questionnaire is enclosed, in duplicate, and I shall be grateful if you will forward it as rapidly as possible; since I am informed that your drilling string is arriving and may begin operations at an early date. With regard to the security of information contained in reports from this Consulate on petroleum matters, I am instructed to mark as confidential all items which are to be reserved for the exclusive perusal of principal officers of the Department and other branches of my Government. Consequently, any information which you provide to this office which is to be kept confidential had best be appropriately marked by you in order that I may follow your Company’s wishes in this matter. NS.. r- r ) r A / -4 D.O. No.C/1209* The 28th October, 1946. Dear colonel Galloway, In July of this year Hart, the American consul at Dhahran, sent me a 'Highway Statistics Questionnaire' pre pared by the Transportation unit of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, commerce Department, ? r ashington, and asked me to supply information regarding road mileage by construction types, main highways, planning and financing, and materials and equipment for Qatar and the Trucial Coast. I replied politely that there were no highway statistics for these two places, and that I had no material on my files from which to answer the questionnaire. 2. Hart passed a copy of this same questionnaire to petroleum concessions Limited, at the same time informing them that he would shortly be sending them a second question naire on the subject of oil. petroleum Concessions Limited have now written to say that they have received this second questionnaire and have sent me a copy together with a copy of Hart’s covering letter, which I attach in original. Packer informs me that P.C.L. have consulted their Managing Director in London, and have received instructions that they should refer the questionnaire to London before taking any action on it, and that they should also obtain our views on it. 3. It would appear from Hart’s letter that this is but the first of many questionnaires, and although there may be, as Hart says, a 23.75# American interest in petroleum Deve lopment Limited, I see no reason why the Company should be called upon to give the detailed information asked for, which is, in fact, far more exhaustive than that supplied by the Bahrain petroleum Company to the Ministry of Fuel and Power, vide correspondence ending with my endorsement No.C/1197 dated the 24th October, 1946. 4.

I enclose a copy of a letter v/hich has been sent by the U.S. Consul, Dhahran, to the Iran Petroleum Company's /.gent for Qatar and the Trucial Coast. The forms vhich accompanied the letter are too voluminous to copy but the information they ask for is extremely detailed and covers production, prices, drilling, marketing and reserves. The Company's vie'./ is that it v/ould be highly inadvisable and detrimental to their interests to supply such information but have referred the matter to us. The acting Political Resident has been informed by Mr, Packer of the receipt of this request. The United States’ representative has already asked for similar information from the Indian Government who in turn asked for the advice of H.M.G. on the reply which should be sent. This question was dealt with by Curson in your Department and we advised him that the information to be given to the United States' representative should be limited to that published officially in India. The same line was taken by the Burma Government v/ho pointed out to the United States' Consul that information of this nature was confidential as between the operators and the Government. &gt;/e agree with the I.P.C. that this information should not be made available to the United States’ Consul and in view of the fact that previous applications of this nature have been dealt v/ith by the Governments concerned and not by the individual Companies, we consider that the reply to the present request addressed to I.P.C. should be made by the Political Resident and that H.M.G. should take the responsibility for the refusal. We would suggest that the Political Resident should be instructed to inform the United States’ Consul that the Company have referred this request to him and that it is not possible to provide information of this kind since it is reg?,rded as confidential by the Company and is not divulged except in so far as the Company is required under the terms of their concession to do so to the concessionary Government; in this case the information is treated as confidential as between the Government and the operator. • Yours sincerely.

I enclose a ‘copy of a letter from Longrigg about the 2 bth IlarcTi) settlement of disputes which may arise between Rulerif or Tribal Chiefs regarding the ownership of oil rights when p.C.L. begin drilling on the frucial Coast. I think that the disputes will, as I said to Longrigg on the telephone, have to be dealt with as they arise, and it will presumably be best that cases should be discussed In the first instance between the company’s Manager at Bahrain and the political Agent. I enclose a copy of my interim reply, and, if you have any comments to offer at this stage we should be glad to receive' them. Copy of Mr. Longrigg’s ('Iraq petroleum Co., Ltd., London) letter dated the 25th March. 1947, to Mr. E.P. Donaldson. I write, as v/e arranged, to confirm our telephone con versation of this afternoon. in it, I indicated that the day was now not distant when we should wish to commence drilling on the Trucial Coast and that we felt it would be essential that the rights over any given drilling site or potential oilfield (that is, in exactly which Sheikhdom it fell) should be estab lished beyond question before drilling began. It is not improb able that some such sites or possible oilfields .may lie in areas susceptible of dispute'by the adjacent Rulers, or (in a slightly different case) between a Ruler from whom we hold rights and a Tribe, claiming to be independent, from whom v/e do not. You confirmed our existing view that such boundary settlements would be the function of the political Resident or political Agent and you encouraged me to think that if and when Such a case were referred to him, he would adjudicate on it and thus place the natter beyond doubt; evidently a most necessary /’thing since conflicting and unresolved claims to a site which ; might prove valuable would be a source of endless trouble and danger. I propose to send a copy of this letter to our Manager at Bahrein with the suggestion that he should approach the P.A. or P.R. in this sense, hoping for a reply, or replies, to ques tions in one of two forms (a) “is point ’A’ definitely within the area of Sheikh ’X', or is it susceptible of any dispute?” or (b) 'can you please tell us, alternatively, what is the line of demarcation between the Sheikhdoms of Sheikh ’Y’ and Sheikh Z . I understand from you, as I should have expected, that you would prefer not to undertake a general ooundary demarcation of the area, but would prefer Political to limit their ruxings to points of possible dispute.
