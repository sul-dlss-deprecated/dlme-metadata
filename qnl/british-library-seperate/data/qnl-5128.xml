As a result of their enquiries, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf conclude that the seizure of the Ras al Khaimah dhow at Sirri Island in November 1935 was an act of retaliation by the islanders against the intervention of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim [Al Qasimi, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim] the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah some years earlier, in a dispute over inheritance involving one of his subjects, who was a relative and beneficiary of the estate of the deceased wife of Ubaid bin Khalfan al Aqrubi. The main correspondents investigating the incident are: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire, both the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, and the Residency Agent at Sharjah whose reports are in Arabic as well as in English. Their correspondence includes both Arabic and English copies of letters and a statement made by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, and also of a witness statement made by the nakuda Salim bin Abdullah. The file ends with correspondence in 1936 relating to the settlement of the disputed inheritance and the return of the seized dhow to its owner, with the assistance of the Iranian authorities. Included in the latter correspondence are letters exchanged between officials at the British Legation in Tehran and both the Foreign Office and India Office in London, as well as a letter (in English translation) from the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tehran, regarding the attitude of the British Government towards the Iranian Government’s claim to sovereignty over Sirri Island.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sirri</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Inheritance and succession</topic></subject><subject><topic>Seizure of vessels and cargoes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000267#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000267#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000267#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
