Appointment of a Oonsul of Muscat in India.Mr, Gibson. oONpnr?- He. Mr. Caroe’a telegram 1042 of the 29th October, on the subject of the appointment of a Consul of Muscat in India. 2. The question came up in an informal cover- sat ion betv/een the Sultan and myself sometime ago, in the following way. The Sultan pointed out that not only did the P.A. Muscat, when issuing visas for Muscatis to visit India,take the visa fees for H.M.G., but that the visafhes for Indians visiting Muscat were also taken by the Government of India. I explained that this was the international custom. If one Govern ment carried out passport duties for another, it was the custom for the first Government to take the fees. The Sultan asked what wouldb e the position in regard to India,if he established a,Consulate in India, and if he could do so. I replied that in the case the Muscat Government would take the f ees, and that H.H. could certainly establish a Consulate in India if he so wished. (See Article 3 of the 1891 Treaty (Aitchison) V61ume XI, page 310). 3. The cost of a de carriere Consul with a Con sulate, would of course be out of all proportion to the visa fees. The Sultan could appoint an honorary Comsul, some citizen in Karachi or Bombay who might cost him little or nothing. Any how, whatever sort of Consul the Sultan appoints, providing that the indivi dual concerned is not persona non grata to us, we cannot object. A Muscati Consul would only get the privileges/-2- privileges accorded in India to the 'public function aries of other countries'• 4. I suggest that Mr. Caroe be telegraphed (a) that the question cropped up in a casual con versation between the Sultan and myself, and further details are being sent by post; (b) that my views are that under Article 3 of the 1891 Treaty, the Sultan has the right to appoint a Consul if he so wishes, and that should the Sul 4 an raise the question in Delhi, he should be informed accordingly if Government of India concur. 5. A letter could then b e sent to Mr. Caroe repeated to India embodying my paragraphs 2 and 3 above. Sd/- T.C.Fowle. India Office, 1937.

New Delhi. I have tlie honour to state that on ay recent visit to Muscat His Highness the Sultan told ne that he had been considering appointing a Consul at Bombay * and enquired ny views. 2. As His Highness is entitled to appoint a Cons il under his treaty I merely repl ied that it was open to him to appoint one whenever he liked and enquired whether he had anyone in mind. He told me that he had no one actually in view but that the type of person he had in mind would probably be a prominent merchant and possibly a British subject, but that he would, of course, consult us fully in advance. Fh added that he was studying the question of expense to which X replied that 2 did not think he would be able to create the appointment at much under Es.1000/- a month. I made no attempt to dissuade him and can only hope that we shall hear no more of the proposal which has several disadvantages, the most important being that we should lose our present control over the issue of visas In Bombay for Muscat. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to His iajesty^ Secretary of State for India and to the Political Agent, Muscat. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, 3d. GEOFFREY PRIOR.

Be appear to have no record here of the final outcome of HPLL Minister’s dis cussions with Ibn oaud on the question. But so far as i uscat is concerned we could hardly refuse to allow the Bultan to appoint a Consul at Bombay if he wants to, since Article 11 of * the i. uscat freaty of Commerce and navigation of H39 (which specifically included India) states 1 that either of the contracting parties may a ooint Consuls to reside in the territories of the other, subject to the consent and approval of the other as regords the persons so appointed and the places at which they reside,.
