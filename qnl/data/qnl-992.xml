This correspondence has been translated into English (from the original Arabic).A number of intelligence reports that were written for the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf are contained in the file. These reports give detailed information regarding tribal movements in Iraq and Kuwait and were written by Political Agent Dickson.Much of the correspondence in the file discusses an individual in the service of Bin Saud named Ibrāhīm bin ‘Arfaj who had been sent to the frontiers of Iraq and Kuwait in order to monitor the borders (after previous disturbances) and to attempt to negotiate the return of a number of camels said to belong to Nejd and be inside Kuwaiti territory. The file contains copies of letters sent by Ibrahim Bin Arfaj that outline his mission and activities in the region.A summary of events leading up to this period (written by Political Agent Dickson) is contained in the file on folios 30-31.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
