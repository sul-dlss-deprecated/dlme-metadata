I regret to inform you of a further grounding of S.S.” BEGUM ' at 09.4L A.M. 9th April, on Rennie Shoal. The attached sketch and papers give details. The fact that I laid off S. W. (True) instead of S. 6 j E. (True) shows the blame for the accident to be entirely mine. I took the bearing myself, as the Acting Second officer was busy working sights. Having allowed error i,e, 2f E. from 9 = 6-1, I laid off S. 6 j W. instead of S. 6 J E. The false position given (sketch P I) gave me to assume she was passing clear of the Shoal, i,e, C III. Had I not made the mistake of laying the bearing off wrongly, I should naturally have seen we were in a dangerous position i,e, P II and altered Course accordingly to clear the Shoal. Vessel struck sharply, vibrating once. Ho bumping. Bilges, tanks, etc., sounded half hourly. Ho change found. After laying off the bearing seen assumed position at 09.SB I had come down to my cabin, where, after signing the Chief Engineer*s Log, I was talking to him, when vessel struck. There is little doubt she struck some hard substance either a 6 1 n R V t rock or some coral, and while triere may be damagej the vibration felt gives me to hope it is only slight. It will be seen I have made a mistake in laying off the wrong bearing, whereby I sincerely hope yuu will give me the benefit of ' Error of Judgement.' I trust your good selves will find no damage to the steamer, and that all reports etc., are to your satisfaction. Due Karachi 14th A.M. Bombay about £3rd.
