(14/21/35) British Embassy, Bagdad. 21st March, 1935. a • Sir, With reference to your express letter No. 274-S of M^rch 15th, regarding the alleged intention of the Iraqi Govenmient to expropriate a portion o f the property of the Shaikh of Kuwait at Fao, I have requested the Director of the Port of Basra to furnish me with a report on this matter. 2. On receipt of this report I will consider what action, if any, I can usefully take. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, sd. Archibold Clark Kerr. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BushireTranslation of a confidential letter No.R-4/2021 dated the 28th Muharram 1354, corresponding to the 2nd May 1935, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After oompliaents, I have with pleasure received your letter No.G-12( dated the 27th Muharram 1354, corresponding to the 30th April 1935, and have noted the summaries of the letters (enclosed therin) which passed between H.M’s Ambassador, Baghdad, and the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the piece of land situated in my Fao property, which Colonel Ward of Port Directorate desire&lt; to take over with a view to building new houses on it for the residence of Port Officials. In very truth I am surprised at the explanations made by His Excellency the Ambassador, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, stating that the abovementioned land was not a part of my Fao property, but was waste land, and I cannot see how the Hon’ble the Political Resident cam© to agree to that. I am confident that their Excellencies both know all about my Fao property, including the area and boundaries (of the gardens) which come under my ownership. There is no doubt whatsoever that the piece of land refer red to above is situated within the area (limits) of my property. Therefore, I beg to repeat my request to you to kindly explain to the Hon f ble the Political Resident very clearly about the abov©mentioned land. It is a sad mis fortune to think that my rights are being so violated, while X am under H.M’s Governments protection* Usual ending.Confidential. POLITICAL AGimCY, KOV/AXT. The 7th May 19S5.

'Intention of the Basra Port Directorate to expropriate a portion of the Shaikh’s Fao property'(Ownership). .. ■ r t ^' Sir, iJith reference to your Jointed Letter Ho.307-S dated the S3rd April 1935 and enclosures (a) Letter No. lV24/ S5 ^ted 4th April from H.M’s Ambassador Baghdad to your address* (b) Your letter No. 306-3 dated 33rd April to H.M's Ambassador, Baghdad. I have the honour to report that as I considered it a matter of urgency that His Excellency the Shaikh should be put in possession of the observations of Hie Basra Port Director, as quoted in H.M's Ambassador’s despatch (a) above, and as it was only fair to both the Shaikh and his attorney Mr. Gabriel, that they should be made acquainted with how things were developing (See my Confidential Letter No. 0-69 of 10th March and enclosures) I took up on myself the responsibility of sending the Shaikh copies in summary of H.M.Ambassador' s letter (a) referredreferred to above as well as your letter (b) by way of answering his urgent letter R-4/1957 dated 7th March 1935. * 2. The Shaikh in reply sent me his letter No.K-4/aD2 dated 2nd May, translation of which I am enclosing with this. 3* He followed up his letter by calling on me personally half an hour later. He was agitated and in excitable state of mind. From the general trend of the conversation that followed I could see that he had un fortunately got into his head that both you and H.M's Ambassador were adopting a rather one sided view of the trouble. 4. The ohailch contended that Colonel lard of the Port Directorate had no right by law, custom, or equity, his to seize a piece of^/land on the mere assumption that he (the Shaikh) had no right to it. 'Who', queried the Shaikh 'made Colonel Ward the judge as to what was his property and what was not?' Surely, the methods of Colonel Ward savoured of the war period, when the military took over what land they wanted irrespective of the rights of owners. 5. What were the facts? Continued the Shaikh - Thw Port Director wanted to build houses for his labourers -h near Fao village, where he had dredging and other interess- He had fixed on a piece of 'waste' land, as he called it, lying immediately behind his (the Shaikh’s) Date gardens, had and/decided that it was the right and convenient piece of land for his purpose. He was told by his agent, as well as by certain local inhabitants that the ground belonged to himself, the Shaikh of Kuwait, so to save his oomcience he had made 'specific' enquiries, with a view to ascertain the exact boundaries of the Shaikh’s properties. As a result he was conveniently told by some person or persons Unknownunknown that the portion he wanted belonged to the IRA.j G overnment. Ho doubt Colonel Viard would have no objection to divulging the name of the person from whom these 'speci fic enquiries' were made. 6. The Shaikh next asked me, how it was that Colonel Ward had not taken the straightforward course of addressing him direct, if he had had any doubts at all as to who was the owner of the property. He did not do this and the workmen rudely entered his grounds and affixed pegs showing the areas to be built on - Surely it would have been an act of simple courtesy to have seen him about the matter first. 7. The Shaikh concluded by saying that he did not think that any law in the world permitted a man to enter another person’s house, seize his property, and then ask him to prove his title, before he agreed to depart. That in effect what Colonel Ward proposed to do. 8. The above, as well as other lines of argumait were put to me by the Shaikh, and pressed h&lt;bme with characteristic vigour, and I confess I had some difficulty in calming him and explaining that all was not lost. 9. In fairness to Colonel Ward the Shaikh did certainly add that he had met him a short time ago in Kuwait, and had found him a particularly d charming person, and that for this very reason he was loath to think too hardly of him and preferred to believe that he (Colonel Ward) was the innowent pawn, in yet another subtle attack on the part of the IRAQ Govemmait - He even hinted that he thought he knew who the person was who had given Colonel Ward advice. 10. Actually I myself think that the seriousness of the issue from the Shaikh’s point of view, has periiaps not beennot been quite fully realized, and with deep respect, I venture to malse the following observations for what they are worth:- (a) We know that the Shaikh possesses no Tapu documents for his 7 miles long Fao estate, but we do know that he has a rt Wahbiyeh? document, and that the 'Saniya* departmait of the late Turkish G-ovem inent , decided that the ruling family of the A1 Sabah held these Fao lands by right of tenure (see previous correspondence). (b) We have from time to time also heard it put forward by the IBAQ Government that the Shaikh has encroached on and taken over certain *Slate' or *Hiri* lands adjoining his property. Ho attempts have however been made to point out actual encroachments or to prove that they were made after 1914 when His Majesty’s Government guaranteed the Shaikh possession of what he held. (c) I myself have gone out of my way to point out in certain despatched, notably that describing the various Faddaghiyeh holdings, that certain 'Shuwatis* and strips of silt land in process of being recovered from the river, had not yet been paid for by the Shaikh, as the Law required, but I have certainly not been able to find out any other portions that were not absolutely the Shaikh’s by right of unchallenged possession since 1914. If any encroachments were ever made, they were made in the dim past and in the days of the Turks, certainly not after 1914. (d) For the benefit of those who do not know the actual lay out of the ground, and th© areas embraced by the various 'Hauzes' or garden strips, which extend in every case from the river bank to the protective bundbund on the land side of the gardens from Basra to the sea at J?ao, there is a waste swamp area, liable to be flooded at high tide from the direction of the Khor Abdulla - which floods are especially dangerous to the date gardens when a strong wind blows up from the Persian Gulf and piles up the water. Boring the Turkish times, when Government was hopeless and control nil, everything was left to the individual, and garden owners all along the yKaae river each year spent much time money and energy building protective bunds in the rear of their gardens, in the endeavour to keep out the flood sea water from entering and ruining their properties - The fight was continuous and long - The rich saved their gardens, the poorer ones lost theirs. (e) Then came the British Administration, during and after the war - The necessity was immediately seen for a substantial and continuous government bund along the back of the date gardens; Government took the work in hand, and the new bund or protective dyke followed in continuous line as nearly as possible along the site of their amateur bunds set up and maintained by each garden owner. (f) Kow for the important point, the new Govern ment bund was such a good and stout affair (especially on the lower reaches of the bhatt al Arab), that its top became the recognised roadway from Abikl Khasib down to Pao, during the rainy and flood seasons - This bund roadway for all practicable purposes forms the desert or land route today to all properties lying near the mouth of the river. The Shaikh only claims as his property, the land lying between the river and this bund0 6 this bund, Th© ,, wastQ f, strip wanted by Colonel Ward lies east of or within the bund in question. (g) The next, and most important point of all to my mind is that, if the Port Directorate get the land they want, and try the methods they are using, a dangerous precedent will be set up, and it will be next to impossible to prevent other claimants notably the IRAQ, Government (if they wish to continue the campaign of pressure on the Shaikh of Kuwait) from taking any slices of land they want, at the expense of the Shaikh. (h) It will be recollected, no doubt, that the main^ reason why the Shaikh’s lawyer fought recently to prevent the Shaikh from being put into Court in Basra by his tenants (oath case) was because he, the lawyer knew that these self iJam© ’fellaheen 1 had prepared their plan and were going to ask the Shaikh in Court to prove his title to the Fao property. Under the strict Interpretation of the land law, if the Shaikh could not have produced Tapu papers, the case would have gone against him. The above I reported at length in despatches at the time. Xi. It is clear to me at this end and I think His Majesty’s Government realize this, that one must support the Shaikh always if any person or person^ challenge his title to any of his exempt properties or portions thereof, and we must take our stand if such challenge arises (and this particularly iB the case fcf a question of the desert boundary crops up) on the following formula, 'Did the present boundary exist, and was it recognized as 'good' by the local fellaheen and 'TAABS', in Shaikh Mubarak’s time, when the 'expedition' promise was given him by His Majesty’s7 :~ Majesty*s Government or not? If it did and the boundary had not been altered, in any way, then that ranained the boundary of the estate, as guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government• If it did not, then official investigation on the spot (with a British office** to represent the Shaikh) should be made immediately and decision arrived av • 12 . In the particular difficulty, which we are now dealing with, I feel^'l may say so, that Colonel ted would have done better to have written and told the Shaikh flankly what he intended doing - X eamot but feel that if this had happened, the Shaikh would have been reasonable, 3^. have reacted well, and would have granted all his requests. -hat has so upset the Shaikh (o^e to understand his feelings properly, one must put oneself in his place and be aware of the past history of the garden, is the fact that he feels that he has been short circuited, and that a great discourtesy has been none hi^u Even now I feel that if Colonel ted were to pay bfcaikh a visit, and put forward his case, all would be woll - - suggest this seriously as a solution of the difficulty, and I hope it will be given a try - The other way will lead to further difficulties.

My dear Ward, Some tine ago there was a good deal of correspon dence between the Shaikh, myself, Bush ire and Baghdad about a small piece of waste land lying behind Fao villags, which belongs to the Shaikh and which it seems you want to acquire as a site for bungalows for some of the Port Directorate Staff. 2. The Shaikh at the time took special alarm at your statement that you had been told that the land was not his, but belonged to Government: and at your practically inviting him to prove his title. 3. This of course would have been an undesirable line of action for him to have taken,especially at a time whBn H* 11* Government were themselves engaged in trying to get the IBAcj Government to admit the Shaikh's full title Colonel J.C. Ward, C.M*G. , C.I*S. ,D.S*0. , Port Director and Director General of Navi^tion,i - 2 - tltX© to his 5 exempt Date Gardens guaranteed to him by promise of H.II. Government in 19X4 (Fao being one of these)* 4 t The line which I took therefore with the Political Resident and the Ambassador was that the Shaikh had been very hurt at the thought that you had not approaohec him direct about the land in the first place,(which was indeed true), and that it was my firm belief that if you could now see your way to run down end see him (the Shaikh) personally or write him a nice letter explain ing the position, he would be genuinely grateful and would be very ready to let you have the plot of ground you required and on the easiest of terms* 5* Fowls who passed through here recently from Baghdad, mentioned that you would probably get the tip from the Ambassador to act on my suggestion and he told me that if I did not hear from you soon, I could write and ask what your plans were* 6* This X am now doing and whilst hoping sincerely that you will decide to come to Kuwait and settle the business hare, X would like to say that both the wife and I extend you a cordial invitation to stay with us in the Agency, for as long as you Ilka, when you do xe come down* Yours sincerely, c^ Confidential.

I enclose translation of letter R-l/73 dated 29th May 1935 from Mr. J. Gabriel, Pleader Basra to His Excellency the Ehaikh of Kuwait. 3. What has happened now is as follows (this was also verbally explained to me by Mr. Gabriel who visited Kuwait on 6th June 1935). The 19 Oath Comaissions emanating from the Peace Court Abul Khasib, which I duly administered on the Shaikh here, were duly returned to the said Court through the British Embassy Baghdad, then the defence lawyer in a last desperate attempt to upset things, pleaded that although X (the Political Agent Kuwait) administered the necessary oath to the Shaikh in his presence, nevertheless the act was Illegally done, as the defendantss d©i*6n.dQn'fes htsid no one prosenl; to watch, their interests* Further that they had expected that such person would have been one of my clerks* 4. Mr. Gabriel contends that in law the defendents* counsel is quite right, but that the whole fault for not mentioning that one of the Agency clerks should be present at the taking of oath by the Shaikh, lay with the Abul Khasib f s Court, which kept silent on the subject. 6. It seems to me that a very frivolous attempt has been made, and upheld in order to once again delay matters and keep the Shaikh affairs unsettled. Lieut-Colonel Political Agent, KuwaitTran slat ion of a letter No.B-l/73, dated the 25th Safar 1354, corresponding to the 29th May 1935, from Mr. J.Gabriel, Pleader, Basra, to His Excellenoy the Ruler of Kuwait• oOo After oompliments, FAQ CASKS . Today I appeared in the Court of Abul Khasib to attend on the eases raised against the 'taabeen* (tenants with permanent holdings) of Fao. The situation of these was as follows: 22 cases were nearing conclusion, oaths on account of which having been taken by Your Excellency; and 21 cases were ready for Your Excellency to take oath, protests having been made against their judge ments passed in default. The opponents* lawyer protested against Your Excellency's oath not having been made in the presence of the opponents, or their representative. ‘Phis indeed is entirely the fault of the court, for not mentioning the matter when papers were sent to Kuwait, seeing that the opponents had already nominated a clerk of the Consulate at Kuwait as their representative, to be present at the time of swearing Your Excellency. The court have therefore decided once again to get Your Excellency sworn, end the oath should this time be Bade in the presence of the Consulate's clerk, in his capacity as the opponents' representative. The court have also decided on Your Excellency's taking oath in respect of the other cross oases. Therefore,the Consulate (Political Agent) will shortly receive through the Ministry and Embassy, 43 oath commissions. It is hoped they will be returned to the court in the earliest convenient time, so as to reach the court before the day appointed for pleading. Usual ending.vf' \ OOKFIDENTIAL .

S.W.l. 15th February, 1935. My dear Bateman, We are most grateful for the explanation, contained in your letter of the 30th January, of the position regarding the Power of Attorney of the agent of the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. It is clear that we must, for the moment, leave this matter for local treatment, and we much hope that you will be able to dispose of it in some satisfactory way# You will of course remember that the present postponement of the Fao cases expires on the 28th February and before its expiry you will no doubt take steps, if necessary, to secure a further postponement. 3. We do not for the moment wish to express any definite view on your suggestion (see last sentence of paragraph 6 of your letter) that it may be better, after the Faddaghiyah case has been settled, to revert to the pre-Faddaghiyah procedure. Indeed we could only do so after consultation with the India Office. provided however that the Irapi Government and the Iraqi courts admit (1) the ordinary principles of international law as regards the immunity of foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction, and (2) that the Sheikh of Koweit is a foreign sovereign, we are provisionally inclined to think/ H. Bateman, Esq., M.C.* . think that in future both we and the Sheikh might do well to admit that there is an exception to this rule as regards actions involving a title to land in Iraq, and that, in future proceedings which fall strictly within this category, the Sheikh should not endeavour to put up a probably useless plea of immunity from the jurisdiction. The exception would not however cover claims by his tenants or employees working on his gardens for their wages or anything of that kind. If these people should have grievances they would have to take them up through the diplomatic channel and not through the courts. 4. Even so, we feel that we must go on hammering at the point that it is entirely wrong for the Iraqi Government or the Iraqi courts to take the line that, because the Sheikh has not submitted to the jurisdiction in a case which comes within the exception, they will obstruct him in some action which he brings as plaintiff. It is entirely improper for the Iraqis to connect the two things in this way. The Iraqi courts are perfectly well able to proceed v/ith actions involving the title to land, i.e. those cornin', within the exception, even if the Sheikh were wrongly to plead immunity and refuse to accept the documents served on him, by adopting suitable rules such as the courts ox nearly all countries have for ’’substituted service 15 where it is Impossible to serve a defendant^in the ordinary way. inis is the manner in which they ought to deal with this point instead of interfering with other quite distinct actions. Yours sincerely. (3d) A. K. Helm.My dear Kuwait Receipt Hated '(s, ~ ^ y/uw/. 15 th fJ.mi.e 193^ l &gt; a^ Thank you for your Confidential letter of theGth June 1935* I think there must be some misunderstanding. It is true that I applied for land but before doing so ascertained from my people at Fao that it was, as far as they could gather from the local residents, well clear of any land owned by the Shaikh. Having applied, it is very difficult for me to withdraw and say I do not want the land when actually l^do. It might be possible for me to move in the direction of the salt pans. As a matter of fact,now that the Iraq Government have appointed a Mudir and made Fao into a Nahia, I cannot make any move outside mv own particular working area, and having applied officially to the Iraq Govt, for a piece of what I understood was their land it is rather difficult for me to write to or see the Sheikh about land I must of necessity apply through Government. In any case I cannot deal direct being an Iraqi Government Official. However if I had some idea where the Shaikh’s land is 1^could, perhaps, put forward now tdthout delay a good reason for shifting the site of my proposed labour camp somewhere else. I fear I cannot come to Kowait just now. I am far too busy and I much regret that His Excellency thinks that I have shortcircuited him for that is the very last thing that I would think of doing.

DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE.Copy of Confidential D«0*No* C-168 dated the 6th June 1935 From Lieut-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent Kuwait, to Colonel J»C« $ard, Port Director and Director General of Navigation, Basrah, Sometime ago there ms a good deal of correspondence between the Shaikh, myself, Bushire and Bagdad about a small piece of waste land lying behind Fao village, which belongs to the Shaikh and ^lich it seems you want to acquire as a site for bungalows for some of the Port Directorate staff, 2, The Shaikh at the time took special alarm at your statement that you had been told that the land was not his, but belonged to Government: and at your practically inviting him to prove his title* 3, This of course would have been an undesirable line of action for him to have taken, especially at a time when His Majesty’s Government were themselves engaged in trying to get the IRAQ, Government to admit the Shaikh’s full title to his five exempt Date Gardens guaranteed to him by promise of H,M# Government in 1914 (Fao being one of these). 4, The line which I took therefore with the Political Resident and the Ambassador was that the Shaikh had been very hurt at the thought that you had not ajproached him direct about the land in the first place, (which was indeed true), and that it was my firm belief that if you could now see your way to run down and see him (the Shaikh) personally or write him a nice letter explaining the position, he would be genuinely grateful and would be very ready to let you have the plot of ground you required and on the easiest of terms. 5, Fowls who passed through here recently from Bagdad, mentioned- 2 - mentioned that you would probably get the tip from the .Ambassador to act on my suggestion and he told me if I did not hear from you soon, I could write and ask what your plans were. 6. This I am now doing and whilst hoping sincerely that you will decide to com© to iiuwait and settle the business here, X would like to say that the both the wife and I extend you a cordial invitation to stay with us in the Agency, for as long as you like, when you do come down.Copy of Confidential D.O. No, 248 dated 15th June 1935 from Colonel J,C,Ward, Basrah to Lieut,Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, Kuwait, i . $■' Thank you for your Confidential letter of the 6th June 1935. I think there must be some misunderstanding. It is true that I applied for land but before doing so ascertained from my people at Fao that it was, as far as they could gather from the local residents, well clear of any land owned by the Shaikh. Having applied, it is very difficult for me to withdraw and say I do not want the land when actually I do. It might be possible for me to move in the direction of the salt pans. As a matter of fact, now that the Iraq Government have appointed a Mudir and made Fao into a Nahia, I cannot make any move outside my own particular working area, and having applied officially to the Iraq Government for a piece of what I understood was their land it is rather difficult for to write to or see the Shaikh about land, I must of necessity apply through Government. In any case I cannot deal direct being an Iraqi Government official. However if I had some idea where the Shaikh’s land is I could, perhaps, put forward now without delay a good reason for shifting the site of my proposed labour camp somewhere else. I fear I cannot come to Kuwait just now. I am far too busy and I much regret that His Excellency thinks that I have shortcircuited him for Ihat is the very last thing that I would think of doing. I applied for what I was- s I was given to understand Shat it was Government land in perfect good faith and if I had had any idea that it was likely to create trouble for the Shaikh I would not have applied for land as I did. It was only because I felt quite sure it was all dear that I moved and will now do all I can to Jjjove out of it. I feel however that I cannot now approach the Shaikh for land, having applied to the Government, I can only flo my best to shift to another site if that is possible.

Sir, I have received Your Excellency's despatch Ho. 240^(25/28/35) of the 2nd May in regard to the service of judicial documents on the Sheikh of Koweit in connexion with his ownership of property in Iraq. 2. In the circumstances explained in that despatch I am of the opinion that, in the absence of further developments, the most desirable course will be to leave the Iraqi Government's notes of the 22nd January and the 9th April unanswered. If however the Iraqi Government should revert to the matter, you should be guided generally by Mr. Rendel's letter Ho.

Excellency Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, K.C.M.G., etc., etc., etc., Baghdad(55/28/35) British Qribassy, Bagdad. 2nd May, 1935. Sir, Sir Francis Humphrys, in his despatch No.700 of December 11th last, transmitted the text of a note which he had addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the refusal of the competent Iraqi authorities to legalise a general Power of Attorney drawn in favour of the Basra agent of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. A translation of the reply from the Ministry dated January 22nd is enclosed herein. My predecessor, having had reason to anticipate that the reply would be unfavourable had, as you are aware from semi-official correspondence on this subject, been successful in attaining the desired end, through channels other than the Ministry of Foreign Aifairs. 3. On April 9th, however, a further note was received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a translation of which is enclosed herein. From this note it would appear that the Ministry are unaware that for all practical purposes the matter is settled, since they enquire whether the Shaikh still maintains his refusal to accept service of legal documents. 4. 1 am in some doubt as to the best method of dealing with this note. In all the circumstances probably the best course would be to leave it unanswered. If the Iraqi Government return to the charge, the most I should leel able to say would be that if, in fact, the Shaikh still refuses to accept service of documents which would place him in the position of a defendant in Court, he is entitled to do so as a sovereign in accordance with the accepted principles of internati onal/international law. 5. I should be glad to receive your instructions on this matter, however, since I am not altogether certain that the Shaikh, as the owner of extensive real property in Iraq, would be able successfully to sustain the plea of immunity if the Iraqi Government chose to press the point. From the authorities on the matter which I have consulted, it appears to me that the Shaikh’s case falls within the exception to the general rule. The Iraqi Government are not unaware of this. 6. I’he Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, whom I consulted, has discussed the matter with Mr. Lloyd, the British Judge in Basra. He says that the Pov/er of Attorney is not needed for any Court cases, but simply for matters connected with the Land Registry. Mr. Lloyd has already informed the Land Registry that no authentication of the agent’s Power of Attorney is required, and that if there were any doubt regardkng Colonel Dickson’s seal and signature, he would elucidate it , personally. This, I understand, is in accordance with established practice. No reference has, in fact, been made to Judge Lloyd, and so far as he is aware, the Power of Attorney has been accepted. 7. Mr. Drower is at a loss to understand the purpose of the note from the Ministry of April 9th, unless it may be regarded as the prelude to an instruction to the Land Registry in Bagdad to the effect that tbe Power of Attorney is not to be accepted without the Ministry’s approval. He adds that there would be no legal justification for such a step. On the other hand, as you are aware, the Government feel very strongly that the privilege which is now being claimed on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait is one skied and unfair. 8. Pending your instructions I will take no action in regard to the note of April 9th from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 9./9.

Bagdad, 22nd January 1935« ft \ M &lt;1 s /r . , f The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their / compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and, with reference to the Embassy’s note No. 721 dated 11th December, 1934 have the honour to state that a power of attorney signed by the Shaikh of Kuwait has been submitted to the Ministry of Justice for authentication. In this v ( power of attorney the Shaikh appoints Solicitor Agob Gabriel as his agent with full powers to enable him to safeguard his property, except however, the power to accept service. This means that under this power cf attorney the agent cannot accept service on behalf of his client, on whom service will have to be effected through the f SV , / I’U f diplomatic channel. As the Embassy must be aware, from the contents of the Ministry’s note No. 8037 dated 21st ^ October, 1934&gt; addressed to the Charge d’Affaires, the ^ Shaikh has refused to accept service even through diplomatic channels. This refusal on the part of the Shaikh results in obvious harm to the interests of Iraqi subjects. It has therefore become a requirement of justice to postpone the authentication of this power of attorney until the question of effecting service on the Shaikh is settled. It is neither fair nor just that he should have the right of instituting legal action against others while, on the other hand he refuses to stand in the position of defendant. The Ministry avail themselves of this opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. Britannic Majesty 1 s Embassy, Bagdad.Enclosure in Bagdad Despatch No. 2k0 of 2.5*35 To.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 15th Petruary, 1935* My dear Bateman, ¥e are most grateful for the explanation contained in your letter of the 30th January, of the position regarding the Power of Attorney of the agent of the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. It is clear that we must, for the moment, leave this matter for local treatment, and we much hope that you will he ahle to dispose of it in some satisfactory way. You will of course remember that the present postponement of the Pao cases expires on the 28th February and before its expiry you will no doubt take steps, if necessary, to secure a further postponement. 3* We do not for the moment wish to express any definite view on your suggestion (see last sentence of paragraph 6 of your letter) that it may be better, after the Faddaghiyah case has been settled, to revert to the pre-Paddaghiyah procedure. Indeed we could only do so after consultation with the India Office. Provided however that the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi courts admit (1) the ordinary principles of international law as regards the immunity of foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction, and (2) that the Sheikh of Koweit is a foreign sovereign, we are provisionally inclined to think that in future both we and the Sheikh might do well to admit that there is an exception to this rule as regards actions involving a title to land in Iraq, and that, in future proceedings which fall strictly within 3.H. Bateman, Esq., M.C.this category^ the Sheikh should not endeavour to put up a probably useless plea of iranunity from the jurisdiction. The exception would not however cover claims by his tenants or employees working on his gardens for their wages or anything of that kind. If these people should have grievances they would have to take them up through the diplomatic channel and not through the courts. 4. Sven so, we feel that we must go on hammering at the point that it is entirely wrong for the Iraqi Government or the Iraqi courts to take the line that, because the Sheikh has not submitted to the jurisdiction in a case which comes within the exception, they will obstruct him in some action which he brings as plaintiff. It is entirely improper for the Iraqis to connect the two things in this way The Iraqi courts are perfectly well able to proceed with actions involving the title to land, i. e. those coming withinthe exception, even if the Sheikh were wrongly to plead immunity and refuse to accept the documents served on him, by adopting suitable rules such as the courts of nearly all countries have for 'substituted service' where it is impossible to serve a defendant in the ordinary way. This is the manner in which they ought to deal with this point instead of interfering with other quite distinct actions. Yours sincerely. (Sd) A.K. HelmCONFIDENTIAL.

I explained that it was causing a most unnecessary amount of trouble and difficulty to everyone concerned, and that we were really becoming rather worried about it. It was no good going back over the early history of the matter or the question of why the pledges had been given. The fact remained that there was a pledge, which we had to see implemented, that the late King Peisal had promised that the Sheikh’s title should be validated, and that Nuri himself had renewed this promise, when it had been agreed that the matter could be settled if His Ve^esty’s Government would pay €2,000. Could not Nuri ^asha do something to ensure that this tiresome quest ion should now be got finally out of the way on the basis which had been agreed upon? 2. Nuri ^asha did not attempt to deny that these promises had be n given, and said that just before he leftBegdad the matter had been discussed by the Council of Ministers. The difficulty then h&gt; d been - according to him - to make the proposed validation square with the tc^rms of existing legislation, end it had been necessary to consult Mr. Brower on this noint. Further it had bem suggested that an undertaking should be given that the Sheikh’s title would not be contested in future; this was impracticable, since no-one could prevent people challenging a title, however legal it might be. 3. I replied that it seemed to me that two things were required. In the first olace, the present action must be disposed of and got out of the way. econd1y, some act vas required on the part of the Iraqi Government, either fey legislation or by any other kind of administrative action which would put the Sheikh’s title on an unassailable basis, i.e. finally/frits '^1 ■ ^ i , K • If / V ■ /X , finally dispose of any technical irregularities there might he in it st nresent.

In case you might liKe to Know why I addressed the Director of Customs direct in the first place, I would point out that it has always been customary for this Office to write or telegraph the Customs Department, Basra direct, in such and similar matters, especially when persons of note like yourself, senior members of the shaikh's family, myself or other Gov ernaent officials were desirous of travelling overland route from Kuwait to Basra, and wanted to take their own motor cars right through to Basra and retain them there for a few days. 3. On such occasions a telegram from me to the Basra Customs Director asking for customary courtesies has always been sent, whilst of course similar reciprocal courtesy treatment has always been extended to all Government officials from Iraq who visited Kuwait iill that happened was that at 3ubair,a deposit fee of Bs.2/8/- was pa id to :i I • ■2 paid to the Customs Department, end the cars number taken. erroneously) that the Customs Department would see their way to grant the usual courtesy treatment provided I wrote them a letter, as X would have done had it been a case oT the Shaikh’s motor car. write my letter before he sent his launch to Fao, and his initial mistake in not doing so is unfortunate and to be regretted. At the same time in view of my subsequent letter to the Director of Customs, I think it would have been a gracious act to have either accepted my explanation or released and sent the launch back to Kuwait, if Customs rules prevented customary courtesies being extended to launches.

Hk. 2 , I shall doubtless be asked for my views in due course and in the meantime should like to nave yours, which ■ i m please let me have as briefly as possible without approacning the Shaikh at this stage. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the despatch need no comments. 4. With regard to paragraph 3. (i) Presumably tne Shaikh could register in tapu these accretions. C 11 ) Prima facie once the land is registered in the name of the Shaikh could not the Shaikh settle with all the 'Tpabin* as he has already done witn some ? (iii) Personally 1 do not think that the danger of any of the Shaikh 1 s family doing this is great ? 5 . With regard to paragraph 4. The first part of this paragraph turns on the answer to 3 (ii) above. 6 . I entirely disagree with the statement in paragraph 4 that 'It is true that, if the Shaikh were deprived of any of his property for some of the reasons set out a.bove - 1 am thinking particularly of the possibility of actions being brought / Lieut.-Colonel H.R .P.Dickson,C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwa it.brought against him by members of his own family - His Majesty’s Government might consider that neither they nor the Iraqi Govern ment could be called upon to compensate the Shaikh under the promises made to him in 1914”. His Majesty’s Government’s promise referred categorically to property of which the Shaikh was in possession at that time and not merely to property which, 20 years later, under the quibbles of Iraqi law he is now found to • 7 . Res the Commission proposed by the Ambassador in his paragraphs 5 and 6 . Prima facie the proposal hPS advantages, but it would seem essentiPl both from His Majesty’s Government’s point of view and the Shaikh’s that the Commission should be a mixed one: an undiluted Iraqi Commission would I imagine not be p cceptable to the Shaikh, nor probably to His Majesty’s Government. One Iraqi and one British Official - an officer with Settlement experience from India who would represent the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government, might form a suitable personnel. But quite possibly the Iraqi Government would not agree ini a foreign official sitting on a Commission dec ling with property within Iraq. 8 . The first sentence of Ambassador’s paragraph 6 is not perhaps very clear, but I assume it has the following meaning.( (1) or Ambassador’s paragrapn b only mentions M boundaries of all lands claimed by the Shaikh”. He has, however, as I under stand it acquired fresh lands since 1914, by accretion and perhaps purchase ? His Majesty’s Government’s promise will not, of course, cover such additions. An additional point to be decided by the Commission might therefore be to enquire into the boundaries of the land held by the Shaikh in ly!4. This point, however, is of more interest to His Maj esty’ s Government in virtue of their 1914 promise than to the Iraqi Government, and might form part of a separate enquiry conducted by His Majesty’s -out Government with^the participation of the Iraqi Government, though the enquiry might make use of the findings of the Commission.) E. I 1 . G. H. — ii Property decided by tne Commission as now under Iraqi law belonging to the Shaikh. The value of the snaded portion, lost by the Shainh, would have to be given to him by His Majesty’s Government under tneir promise. The Iraqi Government will oertiinly never pay it, and tne Shaikh should certainly not have to buy back the land nimseli. Whether he actually bought it back, or whether he kept the money received from His Majesty’s Government in his pocket, would be his own affair.14/46/35) British Embassy, Sir, Bagdad* 28 th Kovember 1935© In his despatch Ko*64 of Jamary 31st, Sir Erancis Humphrys forwarded to your predecessor a c&lt;?py of a note addressed by him to the Acting Minister for foreign Affairs, in which he set out the proposals bf His Majesty*s Government in the United kingdom for a settlement cf the difficulties connected with the properties in Iraq belonging to the shaikhs of Kumlt and Mohammerah* These proposals may be summarised as follows: u) On the understanding that the Iraqi Government would en4ku£e that the Shaikh was given a legally valid and unassailable title to his raddaghiyeh property (except that portion of the Bashiyah section of it which has already been alienated from the Shaikh by a ^ourt judgment). His Majesty’s Government would contribute a sum not exceeding £2,000 towards the expenses which mi^it be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions* (2) Provided that full effect was given to this arrangement and on the further under standing that the Iraqi Government would (a) undertake to make no claims for arrears of taxation against the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in respect of their properties in Iraq, and (b) give a written assurance that no discrimin^ atory taxation would be imposed on the properties of either of these Shaikhs in future, His Majesty’s overnment would raise no further claim for the exemption from taxation of the properties which these Lght Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bt*, G*C*S*I*, G*B*E*, E^c* etc* etc* twotwo Shaikhs own in Iraq# 2# Althou^i the Acting Minister for -Foreign Affairs, who was also Minister of Justice, appeared to react favourably to these proposals, Sir -Francis Humphrys was unable to pers uade the Minister for -Foreign Affairs, on his return from Geneva, to take any action in the matter# My own efforts and the appeal which Mr. Rendel made to J&amp;iri Pasha in Xondon (see your despatch No.450 (E 4066/8^/93) of July 4th last) have been equally unavailing. it seems evident therefore that the solution proposed in Sir -Francis Hj(mphrys*s note makes no greater appeal to the Iraqi overrment tnan previous suggestions, and that there is little hope of their making any real attempt to carry it out. / 3. Meanwhile, a number of facts concerning the nature of the Shaikh of Kuwait*s title to his various estates have been brought to my notice, which have caused me some uneasi- &lt;*i i ■&lt; ll nin ness regarding the merits of the proposals in question. it would appear that there are three reasons for which the Shaikh*s title to certain portions of his property is vulner able s A considerable area of his property consists of land reclaimed from the ^hatt-el-Arab during the last fifty years, ^onsuquently the area of land registered in lapu is less than the area now culitivated and claimed by the Shaikh. According to Iraqi law, the owner of land adjoin ing such reclaimed land has the right to claim registration of the reclaimed land in Tapu on payment to the government of its value in its original unplanted state. Hut this the Shaikh has not so far done. X in one of %e suits now pending in the Uourts, the case of the plaintiff depends on what are known as ' Taab* rights. -Taab* rights can only be extinguished -usually by- 3 - V by a money payment - by an agreement made between the *8£i 3 i aa trees . and the owner of the land. ihey cannot be ex- ^Taabin ** - the persons whonactually first planted tte date ‘•Taabin* 1 - tingulshed by merely securing the registration of the land in the name of the Shaikh. The Shaikh has made private arrangements with many of the * taabin * on his iraddaghiveh 6 8 ilJ jmj property, but not with all of them. 4iere is a possibility of actions being brought against the Shaikh by those H taabin w (iii); Upon the death of a Tapu holder the land devolves on his heirs in the proportions laid down in the Land Uode * The Faddaghiyeh lands axe registered in thenames of Shaikh Mubarak 1 s sons, of vhom one was the father of the present Shaikh. Any of the present Shaikh*s uncles or any brother or sister of the Shaikh might, therefore, ask for the land to be partitioned, and bring an action in the Courts for his share of the revenues. i 4© In these circumstances it seems that litt^L would . be achieved by the issue to the Shaikh of a proper Tapu Sanad 4 in respect of his Faddtaghiyeh estate, which, as you are aware ,:i from paragraph 2 of Sir Francis Humphrys’s despatch »o.64, Pi!? is the means by which it is proposed that the Shaikh # s title to the kaddaghiyeh estate should be made legally sound and un assailable. iiiven thoughthe Shaikh were in possession of such a Sanad , his title to parts of the Jjaddaghiyeh estate itself would not be immune from challenge by such of the t , t * taabin 11 with whom he has not reached a settlement. The ,{j^ ssj: on the Faddaghiyeh estate with whom settlement has not been 8 lt Jafl made, and still more by the 'taabin' of the j-ao estate. which has never been registered in Tapu at all. On this estate the ' taabin ' are actually still cultivating the estate. validityvalidity of his title to his other estates would, of course, not be affected and it now seems that it id far more open to challentse than was thought probable, when the proposals now under consideration by the Iraqi Government were submitted I am thinking particularly of the possibility of actions being Government might consider that neither they nor the Iraqi the promises made to him in 1914, But even in such cases, . . i'* ' tfoSt I*?:,. r - • -• - “•fe’-iiv - &gt;v'. fCi-v -- 1 .t; * -••• His Majesty’s ^overrment would no doubt receive embarrassing cimplaints from the Shaikh, and the whole position would be so uncertain that the solution at present proposed, if carried into effect, would hardly be likely either to give satisfaction to the Shaikh or to obviate the possibility of future disputes with the Iraqi Government# 5# I have accordingly thought it necessary to examine afresh the whole question of the Shaikh of Kumit*s title to his properties in Iraq and to attempt to discover aome means by which all questions of rights to these properties can be ^ealt with now, once and for all# From the advice which 1 mi — have received in the matter, it appears to me that this can only be achieved if the Iraqi (jovemment can be persuaded to set up a Gttamiseion, either by special legislation or others wise, (i) to enquire into the boundaries of all land claimed by the Shaikh, (ii) to examine all outside rights in the land aKd to value such alaims as are proved to be legal rights under the law of Iraq, and (iii) to register in xapu all the lands, etc, of the Shaikhly family as a private Waqf to any of his property for some of the reasons set ou^ above ''V..

Unfortunately, this proposal presents difficulties from Ihe financial aspect, since it would be impossible to determine, before the commissi on had finished its work, the amount of money wMch His Majesty’s ,- overnment and/or the Iraqi Government - and, in respect of any land which may not be considered, in the light of the commission’s findings, to fee covered by the 1914 pledges - the Shaikh of Kuwait would have to pay as compensation in respect of outside rights in the land* But, in spite of this difficulty, the proposal does appear to me to offer the only possibility of a lasting settlement. The cases now pending against the shaikh cannot be estopped for ever and, if they eventually go against him, they will undoubtedly be followed b y others. His Majesty's Government cannot, therefore, afford to set aside any possible means of renderingthe Shaikh's title to his properties com* I pletely unassailable, I accordingly venture to suggest that the merits of the p^posal should be considered by the interested departments of His Majesty’s c^overnment. 7.

The 29th December 1955. \ 'Vi i My dear Powle, ^ vill you kindly refer to your confidential D.O.Ho. 999-3 of 14th December 1935, and which owing to the Christmas and ID festivities throwing us out of gear, I have not been able to answer before. 2 . ^ith regard to para 3 of iuabassador, Baghdad’s letter No. 629 of 28th Nov ember 1955 quoted bv vou in 14/46735 your para 4, my replies are as fbllcws:- (i) Yes, certainly the Bhaikh could register these accretions, provided the Iraq Government will allow him to do so. I say this because I understand that under a law quite recently promulgated in Iraq, no non-Iraqi will in future be allowed to register property in Tapu, that is to say, buy any property or add to any already in his possession. How far this will apply to the Shaikh who owns already property adjacent to the accretions I cannot say. In this connection, the only accretions that I know of are certain silt strips known as 'Shalhas' or 'Shawatis' which have been recovered from the river. These are mentioned in ^nnaxure I - 'Al Mutaaw’ah* sub para (J£) , of my Secret Despatch No.G-294, dated 15th November 1954 - and ^umezure I - ” a 1 ffaddaghiyeh ”, sub para If), of the same despatch. There are no accretions that I know of on the land side, h * 7^ - f £ ( - - M 1 W(ii) Yes,of course the Shaikh could ana would settle with his naabin', as he, together with other owners have done for roany years past, if only these 'taabin' be left alone by Government and not interfered with. Many estates on the bhatt al Arab apart from those owned by the Shaikh have countless 'taabin' tenants and there is no question ever of ejecting this class of person, who hap definite rights. The fact of the Shaikh being given a Tapu Sanad of his own, does not in any way affect the rights of ’taabin', who as the name implies originally plsn ted the trees and so cannot be turned out, as an ordinary fellah can be (iii) There is no danger of this happening in my opinion unless the Iraq Government, by iaea)$ of successful intrigue among the ^1 Subah could persuade them to do so. But this is a very remote possibility and would have to be counteracted here. 3. Regarding para 4 of the Ambassador’s letter (mention ed in para 5 of your D.O.): I do not quite follow the last five lines at bottom of page 3 of the Ambassador’s letter. The rights of a ^taab' have nothing whatsoever to do witta the rights of a Tapu Sanad holder, so I cannot see how the Shaikh’s n title n to parts of the ifaddaghiyeh, can ever 'be challenged by the Taabin”. Their (the taabin) rights, extend almost entirely to the question of evictzaent, nothing more. 4 . I most emphatically agree with what you say in para 6 of your D.O. your 5 # Reference/para 7: As you say the 'Commission' idea has its advantages but I would prefer to see an Iraqi and a Kuwaiti sit on it with a British official with settlement experience acting as President (or '’Watcher'of His Majesty’s Government’s interests), if this could be worked. One person would certainly have to be kept out of the Commission, I think. That is Jardine , the present landland settlement officer in Iraq, Between ourselves, Jardine aired his anti-Kuwait views where gardens-lere concerned, so unwisely and openly whan he was adviser in Basra, that the Shaikh looks upon him as one of the chief enemies behind all his garden troubles, 2 ntre nous I am not at all sure that he is not the person mentioned by the Ambassador in his para 5 ,as having given him certain advice, 6 . Regarding your para 8 . I think the .ambassador * s meaning is as you have put it, though 1 fancy the land acquired from the river (as far as I know there has been none purchased) will on investigation turn out to be a comparatively small aD1 °uat • L ■ 11 ^ &lt; r , { , f fresh T&amp;pu danads could be given without any difficulty at from those self same Ganads. There are 32 Banads in all (vide annexure I of my despatch 0-294 of 15th November 19 34)- Then it could be easily discovered by measuring the area given on the original Sanads, with what is on the ground, how much fresh lend had been acquired since 1914. The Ghaikh could then be asked to buy this fresh bit, and take out another Tapu Sanad for same. (b) oimilar methods could be applied in the case of the ?, Mutaaw , ah t, property. (c) A1 ''arhaniyeh and a! Ujairawiyeh are very small and have bed no 'additions' tacked on to them at all, I think. (d) There remains the i**&amp;o property. Phat the suggested commission could tackle in the following order:- 7. (a) liy own view is, that in the case of the ^adcaghiyeh, (i) :?ind out what its exact extent was in 1914, by means of witnesses etc, as well as careful (ii) Then the shaikh could be given Tapu Gamuts for this. Uii)/since 1914 could fairly easily be estimated, and the dhaiKh could be asked to buy these out, and take fresh Tapu oanads for them. The point to remember being that the boundaries of the property as it stood in 19 14 must first be discovered and disposed of by issue of Tapu deed. (e) All this dragging in of 'Taabin’* rights etc. etc. issue merely tends to cloud a simply/, I think, and is unnecessary. (f) The whole question turns on whether the Iraq Government are imbued with good will, and genuinely want to find out what the Shaikh* s rights are, or whether they want to deprive him of his properties by attacking secretly with one hand and raising difficulties where there is a prospect of settliag them. If the former is the case the matter is comparatively easy of solution, if the latter, then nothing will end the natter except the strongest pressure from His Majesty’s Government. 8 . In conclusion, I would ask you to read once again (a) my secret despatch C-2J0 4 of 15th November 1954 including annexures i/and II; / (b) my confidential despatch C-244 of 1st August 1955 as many points prophesied there willVssist you more to understand the Ambassador’s letter.

(14/46/35) 28th November, 1936. Sir, In his despatch No. 64 of January 31st, Sir Francis Humphrys forwarded to your predecessor a copy of a note addressed by him to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he set out the proposals of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for a settlement of the difficulties connected with the properties in Ira* belonging to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah. These proposals may be summarised as follows:- (i) On the understanding that the Iratii Government would ensure that the Shaikh was given a legally valid and unassailable title to his Faddaghiyah property (except that portion of the Bashiyah section of it which has already been alienated from the Shaikh by a Court judgment). His Majesty’s Government would contribute a sum not exceeding £ 2,000 towards the expenses which might be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions. (ii) Provided that full effect was given to this arrangement and on the further understanding that the Iraqi Government would (a) undertake to make no claims for arrears of taxation against the shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in respect of their properties in Iraq, and (b) give a written assurance that no discrimin atory taxation would be imposed on the properties of either of these Shaikhs in future. His Majesty’s Government would raise no further claim for the exemption from taxation of the properties which these /two Ught Honourable Sir Gamuel J.Q. Hoare, Bt., G.C. 3 .I., G.B.E., et c *# etc., etc.a ’.o - 1 il fl99!i two Shaikhs own in Iraq. Althoiigh the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was also Minister of Justice, appeared to react favourably to these proposals, 3ir Prancis Huaphrys was unable to pers uade the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on his return from deneva, to take any action in the matter. My own efforts and the appeal which Mr. Kendel made to Kuri Pasha in London (see your oespatch No. 460 (E 4066/82/93) of July 4th last) have been equally unavailing, it seems evident therefore that the solution proposed in Sir Francis Huaphrys'a note makes no greater appeal to the Iraqi Government than previous suggestions and that there is little hope of their making any real attempt to curry it out. Meanwhile, a number of facts concerning the nature oi the Shaikh of Kuwait’s title to his various estates have been Drought to my notice, which have caused me some uneasi ness regarding the merits of the proposals in question. It would appear that there are three reasons for which the Shaikh*s title to certain portions of his property is vulnerable (i) A considerable area of his property consists of land reclaimed from the Shatt-al-Arab during the last fifty years. C nsequently the area of land registered in Tapu is less than the area now cultivated and claimed by the Shaikh. According to Iraqi law, the owner of land adjoin ing such reclaimed land has the right to claim registration of the reclaimed land in ¥apu on payment to the government of its value in its original implanted state. But this the Shaikh has not so far done. (ii) In one of the suits now pending in the Courts, the case of the plaintiff depends on what are known as 'Taab' rights. 'Taab” rights can only be extinguished - usually by/'by a noney payment — by an agreement made between the “ Taabin ** — txie person who actually first planted the date trees — and the owner of the land* They cannot be extinguished by merely securing the registration of the land in the name of the Shaikh* The Shaikh has made private arrangements with many o** the ' tehbirf on his Faddaghiyah property, but not with all of them. There is a possibility of actions being brought against the Shaikh by those tnabin ** on the Feddaghlyah estate with whom settlement has not been made, and still more by the 'taabin” of the Fao estate, which has never been registered in Tapn at all. On ti;is estate the w taabin 1 * are actually still cultivating the estate. (lii) Upon the death of a Tsui holder the land devolves on his heirs in the prooortions laid down in the Land Code. The Faddaghiyah lands are registered in the names of shaikh Mubarak v s sons, of whom one was t e father of the present Shaikh. Any of the present Shaikh’s uncles or any brother or sister of the Shaikh might, there ‘ore, ask for the land to be partitioned, and bring an action in the Courts for his share of the revenues. 4. In these circumstances it seems that little would be achieved by the isaue to the Shaikh of a nroper Tapu Bnnad in respect of his Faddaghiyah estate, which, as you are aware 'rom paragraph 2 of Sir Francis Hymphrys’s despatch No.64, is the means by which it if proposed that the Shaikh’s title to the Faddaghiyeh estate should be made legal y sound and unassailable. Even though the Shaikh were in possession of such a gna d, his title to parts of the Faddaghiyah estate itself would not be immune from challenge by such of the f1 ta bln” with whom he has not reached a settlement. The validity of his title to hie other estates would, o course, not be affected and it now seems that it is far more open to challenge tha was thought probable, when the proposals now under consideration by the Iraqi Govern ent were submitted to t .em. It is true taet, if the Bhaikh/Shaikh were deprived of any of his property for so le of the reasons set out above - I am thinking particularly of the possibility of actions being brought against him by members of his own family - His Majesty’s Government mightconsider that neither they nor the Iraqi Govern ent could be called u on to compensate the Shaikh under the promises made to him in 1914* But even in ouch cases, His Majesty’s Government would no doubt receive embarrassing complaints from the Shaikh, and the whole position would be so uncertain that the solut on at present proposed, if carried into effect, would hardly be likely either to five satisfaction to the Shaikh or to obviate the possibility of future disputes with the Iraqi Government* 5 * I have accordingly thought it necessary to examine afresh the whole question of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s title to his properties in Iraq and to attempt to discover so r.c leans by which all questions of rights to these properties can he dealt with now, once and for all. From the advice which I have received in the matter, it ©p ears to me that this can only be achieved if the Iraqi Government can be persuaded to set up a Commission, eitner by special legislation or otherwise, (i) to enquire into the boundaries of all land claimed by the Ghaiidi, (ii) to examine all out si e rights in the land and to value such claims as are proved to be legal rights under the law of Iraq, and (iii) to register in Taxni all the lands, etc* of the S' Shaikhly fami y as a private Waqf to be administered by the ruling Shaikh of Kuweit for the benefit of himself and members or the Shaikhly family, and to forbid t * Iraqi Courts to entertain actions by the members of the Ghaikhly family regarding their share in these lands* 6 . Unfortunately, this proposal presents difficulties i rot,. the financial aspect, since it wmld he impossible to determine, before the Commission had finished its work, the amount of uoney which His Hnjesty’s Government and/or the Iraqi Government and, in respect of any land which may not be considered, in the/the light of the Cohesion’s findings, to be covered by the 1914 pledges ~ the Shaikh of Kuwait would h^ive to pay as compensation in i aspect of outs do rights in the land* But, in spite of t&gt; ir. difficulty, the proposal does ap 'ear to me to offer the only possibility of a lasting settlement. The case© now pendin against the Sheikh cannot be estopped for ever and* i f they eventually go against him, they will undoubtedly be followed by others. His Majesty *8 Government cannot, therefore, afford to set aside any possible means of render in * the Shaikh’s title to his properties completely unassailable. I accordingly venture to suggest that the merits of the proposal should be considered by the interested departments of His Majesty’s Government • ?. Should you desire me to pursue, this proposal officially with the Iraqi Government, I have the honour to suggest that, in the first instance, I should be authorised to ascertain from then whether they would, in urinei He, be prepared to set up a Commission on the lines suggested. Should their reply be favourable, then would be time enough to discuss the financial details. I realize that it would be necessary to obtain the consent of the Shaikh of Kuwait to the proposal. But I assume that, if it were explained to him that this is the only means by which his title to all hie property in Iraq can be rendered once and for all unassailable, he would not wish to raise objection or indeed be in a position to do so. 8 .

The secretary of State is doubtful whether consideration of the losses arising out of Iraqi taxation suffered by the two shaikhs can be altogether divorced from the examination of ^ir Archibald Clark Kerr f s proposal and in these circumstances he would propose that both questions should be discussed at the interdepartmental meeting foreshadowed in paragraph 3 of 'foreign Office letter under reference. 3 ix cony of this letter is being sent to the j.reasur^ • The Under ecretary of State, I am, nir , Your obedient servant India Office.&amp;//( /YM_ Txdnfidential .

Sir, I have laid before the Lords Commigsioners of ilia Majesty^s Treasury Mr. Rendel^ letter of the 31st December (E 7138/82/93) with the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad in regard to the date gardens in Iraq of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah. 2. In reply, I am to request you to inform Mr.Secretary Eden that My Lords would prefer to await the comments of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Kuwait before expressing an opinion as to the course of action proposed. They would suggest that, while those comments are awaited, further information should be sought on certain points connected with the new factors mentioned in Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s despatch. 3. It would be desirable to know whether land reclaimed from the Shatt-al-Arab adjoins all the Shaikh’s estates which are covered by the pledge, and if not, which; for what reasons the Shaikh has refrained from claiming registration of this land; and whether there is any reason to suppose that, if such a claim were made, rival claimants would appear, or other obstacles arise. 4. The nature of the 'Taab” rights referred to in the despatch is far from clear to Their Lordships. They would be glad of a fuller explanation of this. It is not altogether clear whether the n taab in' are claimants to the ownership of / The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE.- 2 - of the land, and Whether the success of the ’’taabin' plaintiffs would result in the Shaikh’s dispossession. If the claims of these plaintiffs are simply to monetary compensation, the question may arise whether His Majesty’s Government are bound to safeguard the Shaikh against them. 5.

UU) Colonel Dickson thinks* and 1 agree* that the danger of any of this; &gt;heikh 9 s family doing this is remote* it would be the business of the Shaikh to cheek any tendwr.ey (a) The first part of this paragraph, regarding the possibility of challenge to the Shaikh 9 • title by his n*abin», is dealt with in my paragraph 5 (ii) above* (b) /** regards challenge to hie title by members ^f hi* own family, as mentioned in my paragraph 5 UU! above, this possibility is remote.

As mentioned in paragraph 3 iiiil above, it would be for the Shaikh, in hie own interests and that of the whole nbeh family, to meet any danger of this nature. 5. With regard to the Ocsrsmission proposed by His iyccellency The Ambassador in his paragraphs 3 &amp;nd 6 . .irlaa facie, the proposal has advantages but it would seem essential both from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, and that of the Shaikh, that the Commission should be a mixed one* * purely Iraqi Commission would not, I imagine, be accepts He to the Shaikh, nor, probably, to Mis f&amp;Jcety'e lover meant. One Iraqi and one British official - say an officer with ettlenent experience from India, who would represent the BJaaikh and Mis Majesty’s Government, might form a suitable personnels and the choice of such an officer would be less likely to give rise to complaints from either party of bias than if the British representative were an official from Iraq or the Persian Gulf. t is possible, however, that the Iraq Government may object to a foreign official sitting on a Commission dealing with property within Iraq* On the other hand, tue fact that the question is one involving the interests of Hie H&amp;j ©sty* a Government and the independent uler a await, furnisnes a strong argument for their having a representative on the Commission* 6 * X ma glad to note from the correspondence ending *nt&amp; ndla office letter Bo.

THIS QUESTION OF THE ACCUMULATED LAND T,D£i£8 UvvINO BY THE AMEER OF KUWAIT AND SHAIKH KHAZAAL. I.D.25,000 aM I.D.30. ’’The ♦aq Nas rt newspaper of Basrah has published a ’'word in its latest number, in which it said that the 'British Government gave a pledge to both the Ameers of 'Kuwait and Mohamiaerah, in return for their help to her 'during her invasion of Iraq, not to levy any land taxes 'on their properties. This/state of affairs, the said l&gt;aper goes on, continued to exist up to the end of 1927, 'when the Iraqi Government found out that it was detrimental 'to their income and that they were not bound to execute 'a pledge given by another government. They, therefore, 'at once ordered the two 8haikhs , existing properties in 'Iraq to be registered for levying the usual tax on them. 'The taxes due from the said two Lhaikhs for the period 'from 1927 to 1931, when the ’Istlhlak Law of Taxation* 'was issued, amounted to I.D.30*... IJ 'newspaper of Basra. Dome local papers have also quoted 'the news with its defects. As the abovementioned figure 'could not be relied upon, we deputed our local reporter 'to refer to well informed quarters from whom he discovered 'that the taxes accumulated against the abovementioned 'two Shaikhs were I.D.25,000 approximately. It is understood ♦however, that it is intended to levy only a portion of the 'amount and waive the other portion. Ho final decision, 'however, has as yet been adopted in this connection.

(Spies With reference to the correspondence ending with v\y telegram No. 16^ of the 19th June last, 1 have the honour to inform you that, in a recent inter view, the Iraqi Minister for .^orei^n Affairs raised once a^ain the question o** the position of the Shaikh of Kuwait in regard to civil suits. His ISxcellency complained on the usual lines that at present the Shaikh was able to ^ile civil suits in the Iraqi courts through powers of attorney driven to his a^en*8, but that no actions could be brought against him, as he would not accept service of the necessary le^al documents e A list of the cases which are said to have been held up owinp to the uncompromising attitude of the Shaikh has since been forwarded to me by the Birector General of foreign Affairs and a translation is enclosed herein. B. On January 9 ^^ x replied to Muri -Pasha I had studied the Embassy files on the subject, but had ^ound that no ^ur+her in foliation had been re ceived since the no^e No. 318 of +he 14th Jtme (see my despatch No. 330 of the 15th .Tune) had been addressed to the Ministry of foreign Affairs. Since, however, it now appeared the + the Iraqi Government desired to pursue the matter further, I would, as promised in paragraph ’’'he Bight Honourable \nthony Eden, M.O.,corrpetent quarters. You will observe that in the last two oases mentioned in the enclosed list, it is not *he Shaihh of Kuwait hinself who is quoted as defendant, but one of his relations. ‘'•he Shaikh’s claim to immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts is made on the ground o* his status as an independent foreign sovereign and connot, therefore, be extended to cover his relations. Documents have, in fae + , on several occasions during the last few years , been served through the diplomatic channel on various relations of the Shaikh, including Maryam bint Shaikh Mubarak and an attempt to serve the actual documents involved in the last case mentioned in the enclosed list was resisted by that lady, not on the grounds of anv claim to immunity, hut on the ground that she had received no legacy from her husband. 4° these circumstances 1 would propose, subject to vour concurrence, to inform *he Iraqi Minister for foreign Affairs that there is no question of im munity claimed b^r the Shaikh beinv extended to his re lations and that His Majesty’s Embassy are always prepared to forward legal documents emanating from the Iraqi Courts to the Political Agent at Kuwait for service on any Kuwaiti excrot the ruling Shaikh himself, I am very doubtful of the validity of the reasons for which Maryam refused service of the documents involved in the laet case mentioned in the enclosed list and would therefore propose to add that, if the Iraqi Covernmen- 4 : are no* satisfied with her reasons, it is always open to them to say so and toto return the docunents to this I2whafi»y in order t&gt;»t a second attemot to effect service nay be node. ''he renainlnp six canes nentioned in the enclosed list all concern the onnerahip o* nortionn of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s date gardens in Iraq qnd in each of + hem +he Shaikh hinnel^ is cited an de fendant, 'Hie persons quoted an nentioned in Hr.

'he question of the righ + of the Shaikh of Kuwait in international law to refuse to accept ser vice of documents which require him to appear as a defendant in +he Iraqi Courts has been -^uily dis- cussed in correspondence ending wi th Sir John Simon’s telegram r T 0# 161 of +he 18th iTiune, 1938. After carefully studying ^his correspondence 1 feel that there can be little doubt that the general rule of international law under which the Shaikh is entitled to claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts is subject to an exception in connection with actions relating to the title of a foreign sovereign to real property owned by him in another country, and that the cases now under consideration come within //GuA the scope o^/exception. I understand, too, that the Iraqi Government themselves are well aware of this. °n the ground of equitv, therefore, 1 m loth in anv further discussions with the Iraqi Government to maintain *he attitude that the Shaikh’s refusal to accept service of the documents at presen* under discussion4* diacunaion ia wholly Notified in international la*. An a + tennt to do so would, in my opinion, also he bad nolicv, since it would almost certainlv affect adversely the prospects of persuading Iraqi aovernmenl *o af?ree ^o a reasonable settlement of all questions relating to the date ^ardena in Iraq of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammerah and mi^ht indeed embarrass my no* cordial relations with the Iraqi Government, ^* On the other hand, it is clear that if *he shaikh were now to admit the erce])tion to the general rule and were to acceo+ service of +he documents con nected witp the auitn vhich have been filed against him, he mipht as a result be deprived larrre portions of hia property in Iraq which he would claim, perhaps justifiably, 4, o have been covered by the pledge *?iven f o him on behal^* of Hie Majesty’s Government in 1914, It would then be necessary/ to compensate the Shaikh for the loss of such of the property in question as rai^ht be found to have been covered by the pledges of 1G14, and it would no longer be possible to settle the question of the respective responsibilities in this rs matter of His Majesty’s Government and of the Iraqi f ? Government on the line$ of the proposals contained in !. r ( \ Gir Francis Humphrys’s note Wo* 3&gt;^fthe PPth January 1935 (see his despatch No. 6&lt;fof the 31st January 1935) or with any modification thereof which may be decided uoon when my despatch Ho. 6P9 oT + he f&gt;Rth November last has been considered bv the competent departments of His Majes+v’s Government. In this event 1 imayine that His Majesty’s Government would be unwilling to accept entire responsibilitv for compensating the the Ghaikhs, and that if the Iraqi Government were, as I eypec + , not prepared to accept a part of the respon sibilitysiMlity of their own accord, would be obliged to ask them to agree to subnit the natter to sone forn of arbitration, M *o this course there are obvious objec tions, and in ray opinion it should only be adopted as a last resort. ft. I doubt whether the Minister for foreign Affairs realizes *he full Irani lentions, as explained in the preceding tb ragraphs , his request tte t the ihh should agree to accept service of the docuraen^s con nected with the cases now pending against hira, and X feel certain that he and the Iraqi Oovemraent as a whole genuinely believe that the Sheikh is taking ad vantage of the protection afforded to hira by TTis Maj esty’s Oovernraent to adopt an attitude in the natter which can be justified on the grounds neither of equity nor of international law. I venture to suggest, there fore, that I should be authorized to move from the unconpronising position which X and ny predecessor have previously been instructed to take up in this nat ter and to explain the position franklv to the ±raqi Government. X should then feel ranch no re hopeful of heincr able tq enlist their genuine help in an endeavour to find a satisfactory solution for all the complicated problems arising out of the ownership by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhararaerah of property in this country and of the pledges in respect of this property which were given to the Shaikhs on behalf of His Majesty’s Gov ernment in 1914. 9.

AHCHIHAL9 CLAHJC K32H9„His Excellency His B.M*s Consul General, 3USHIRE . Excellency, | 'Jfhen the British Government occupied Basra, it proclaimed officially that its only object was to do justice to the people in Iraq for justice was only established by the various Governments to bring th their laws into execution and there is no doubt that such circulars as ' proclaimed were registered on the white sheet f History, and that its [ sanctity will last for ever, and its genuinely will be transferred from one generation to another, for the tone of ft^i's wording resuunds for ev er in the ears same as the echo that sounds everlastingly in the atmos phere as long as the heavens and earth are in existence. It is a very .Kind promise indeed, derived of a pure source of a truthful speaker and a reliable publisher for this reason the Iraqis P remained perfectly assured of your generous promise, and attached their faith and believe into it with a pure heart and claar conscience as th^ were worded with full understanding,and that these circulars Iraqis cal] in their reference | their attention to them/in their judicial cases, to see with their |f owfc eyes their praiseworthy affects. The state of affairs has now taken another shape, and the positioi r completely changed by the establishment of a new Iraqi Government which became bound in alliance with the Great British Government which undertook on her own the management of Iraqi foreign affairs as long as the sun shines, and the British Authority rules over the largest | portion of the Globe,and even in the Persian Gulf,and specially Kuwait, I where the Shaikh is subjective to British advice, with the Shaikh of Kuwait I have important affairs of difficult aid very knoty nature,which no one else but the British Government can solve or undo.And I hereby r beg to lay it out before your kindness with my hopes fully based on the 'wording of the abovemeritioned sacred circulars which applies exactly in my case 0 I mw3C2 [, 3 . ;,i ^i|; ini ihi I3t iJili - 2 * ' .’J/O I am an Iraqi in origin, and possessed extensive land property which I inherited from my forefathers, but Shaikh Ahmad al Jabar at Sabah confiscated all my property and turned me out of it by force majors,and H.h,. is still enyoying the benefit of my land property which he obtained illegally and unjustly,on my part I am weak and ufcable to oppose him or raise objections to him for he is a great authority and I am singlehand- ed without support. I was compelled however in the year 1933 to file a suit against him in the Court of first Instance Basrah,which was r egistered under Serial No.282/1933, but unfortunately I could not serve the Summons of the court upon my defendant neither in person nor to his epresentativ« i in Iraq,and that the Court itself tried also its best on several occasions to serve the surmnons upon the Shaikh either personally or otherwise but lts ' ® rts went i' ^ain, and was met with complete failure each t ime. | I was rather stupefied with such transaction &amp; dealings contrary to the spirit of justice and void of equity.Andl therefore feel compelled once more to submit my grievances through your good offices,with full hopes that after perusing my petition you will be kind enoughto render me a*iy assistance possible in your power to solve my knotty problem. For I am inclined to believe at last that you alone can solve my problem, similar to other matters solved by your kindness.'Firstly in your capacity as Political Agent of Great Britain I feel assured you will not refuse V nearty request of a weak man, and beseech you in the name of justice (i.e. the justice which has nothing to do with policy) to take any arrang- f ent P° s 3i E le to serve the summons either to the Shaikh in person or , o his representatives, and by doing so you will admit yourself as ^otector of justice to which a^s a representative of Great Britain is )T$ il f l9£i L'l: . f ever known, for Great Britain is widely known forits good and just Management all over the word, throughout her Kingdome and in the lominions in general,, sd. hussein hamad hamdi through Haj i Kadhem el Badir Ashar Basra.CONFIDENTIAL.

G. Ja.r d • lu» Hale Ji«sq. ,(E 577/19/93) (107/5/36). British Embassy, Bagdad. 23rd January, 19 36 l*y dear Jack, )n\ As I imagined you would want an early answer to your Chancery letter (E 7138/82/93) of the 8th January and to your despatch No.21 (E 73/18/93) of the 9th January about the Shaikh’s date gardens, I asked Drower to come and discuss the questions raised in them yesterday. I am afraid the information which he was able to give me was neither definite nor complete enough for incorporation in an official despatch. He ha.s promised to write to Lloyd at once but, as it will probably be some time before an answer comes and as even he rray not be very helpful, T will give you in this letter such information as I can. 2. I v/ill take ta,ab rights first. It appears that when a date garden is planted the fellaheen who actually plant the trees acquire ipso facto the right to a small portion of the land planted. This right can only be extinquished by a money payment. The right is, however, a right to the portion of the land in question and not to a certain sum of money, and would presumably become entitled to the land in respect of which he held such rights. Whether the Shaikh could be said to have been in de facto possession in 1914 of any portion of land in respect of which someone else subsequently established taab rights is a question which I do not feel competent to answer. 3. As regards reclaimed land, Drower does not know how much there is or how nany of the gardens are affected; but a plaintiff who won a case on the ground of taab rights he /he is almost certain that the Shaikh has not made the necessary payment to the Iraqi Government in respect of any part of it and that it is, therefore, all unregistered. I do not think there could be ary question of rival claimants to ^reclaimed land unless in any particular instance the land adjoining the reclaimed land, though now in de facto posses sion of the Shaikh, is itself claimed by somebody else. Whether this is the situation with regard to any of the land claimed by the Shaikh I do not know. 4. I am afraid we are becoming increasingly doubtful here about the possibility of persuading the Iraqis to set up a commission with powers as wide as those suggested by Lloyd. But we do feel that the first step towards a solution is to discover (a) the extent of all the land claimed by the Shaikh, (b) the extent of those portions of such land whose ownership by the Shaikh is disputed by anyone for any reason whatsoever, and (c) the exact reason for which the ownership each portion of disputed land is in doubt. If the Shaikh cannot provide us with this information, the only means of discovering it would appear to be to set up a commission - even if it is only a commission of enquiry. 5. Grower is asking Lloyd to let him have any information of this kind which is available. However, I very much doubt whether he will be able to help much. Yours ever, (signed).B.Gorell Barnes.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/145</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/145</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/5 VI SHAIKH’S DATE GARDENS.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-27T22:46:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (202 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 204; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains correspondence related to the date gardens owned by the Shaikh of Kuwait, Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ, in southern Iraq.

The volume also concerns the service of judicial documents emanating from the Iraqi Government on the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with his ownership of the gardens and the refusal of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to recognise the Power of Attorney presented to them by the Shaikh of Kuwait’s lawyer in Basra, J Gabriel.In the volume, British Officials discuss the failure of the Iraqi Government to validate the Shaikh’s title to his Faddaghiyya gardens, the Shaikh’s appointment of his son Muhammad as his attorney in Iraq, and the appointment of Abdul Jalil Partu as the Shaikh’s pleader in Basra instead of J Gabriel. The volume also includes correspondence related to the demands for customs duty by Iraqi customs authorities on Shaikh of Kuwait’s motor launch.The main correspondence is between the Political Agent, Kuwait, the British Ambassador, Baghdad, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Iraq, the Ruler of Kuwait, and the Foreign Office, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Justice</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Fāw</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Suit of court</topic></subject><subject><topic>Power of attorney</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
