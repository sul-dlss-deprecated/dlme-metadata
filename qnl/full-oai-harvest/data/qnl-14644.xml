If the evidence shows a strong presumption of guilt the Gaekwar (Malharrao) would be suspended and placed under supervision somewhere suitable, and the Government (through Pelly) would take responsibility for the administration of the state pending an investigation.A special Commission of High Judicial and other functionaries, including native representation, would need to be formed, with public proceedings under British judicial law, which Pelly would need to have nothing to do with other than ensuring its protection.The letter also suggests that the Gaekwar would be exiled if found guilty, and that consideration would need to be given as to which relative would succeed him as Gaekwar. Lord Northbrook also suggests that the reasons behind the temporary assumption of administrative responsibility would need to be made public and that a European force would be required to cover all contingencies.The letter concludes with Lord Northbrook asking that Pelly continue to give his opinions 'with the utmost frankness' on the matters being discussed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023552914.0x000005#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
