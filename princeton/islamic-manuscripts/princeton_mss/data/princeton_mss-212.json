Title provided by cataloger. The number of lines per page varies. Fol. 17a-31b are from the same hand: 15 lines per page, written in a very casual large script in black ink with use of red (autograph). Fol. 32a-38a are from the same hand: 19 lines per page, written in small naskh in black ink with use of red. Dark cream paper with laid and chain(?) lines visible ; frame-ruled. Fol. 12-16 are narrower than the rest of the leaves (182 x 125 mm.). Fol. 5-6 (blank) and 10: later paper. Foliation in pencil using Western numerals (with a fol. 18bis, explaining the discrepancy with Mach's catalog). Two of the texts are autographs written in 794 H.
