Phayre also outlines his proposals for military positions that would be required to undertake such actions.The letter concludes with Phayre informing Merewether that he is ready to march once his work at Jacobabad is complete and that he would prefer to depart earlier for the march as he may be required to attend the High Court in Bombay in connection with the trial of John Barron, a public servant in Upper Sind accused of a criminal breach of trust.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
