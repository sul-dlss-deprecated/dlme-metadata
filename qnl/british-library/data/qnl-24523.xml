No. 90-1895, dated Bushire, the 17th August 1906. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul-General, for Fars, Khuzis* tan, etc. To—His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran. In continuation of my telegram, dated 14th instant, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the outstanding dispute regarding the location of (i) the Cable House and (2) the Telegraph Office at Bunder Abbas. 2. When your telegrams Nos. 18 of 14th July and 121 of 19th idem, were received here, I was at sea and out of communication ; but they were duly repeated by my First Assistant to His Majesty’s Consul who replied on 20th in the sense of the two paraphrases accompanying. I myself reached Bunder Abbas on 23rd July in order to drop Lieutenant Gabriel proceeding to Bunder Abbas in relief of Lieutenant Shakespear appointed to an acting vacancy at Muscat; but as I was in quarantine I was unable to land. Lieutenant Gabriel joined his post with an open mind and I gave him the strictest injunctions to endeavour to come to a friendly understanding or com promise with Monsieur Stas, in order to bring this tiresome Cable question to a settlement. Contrary to previous precedent, however, Monsieur Stas has not yet seen fit to give our representative an opportunity of making his acquaintance by calling at the British Consulate, but on the contrary has sent Lieutenant Gabriel a message saying he expects the first visit. I mentioned the omission to Monsieur Heynssens here, telling him of the instructions which I had given to Lieutenant Gabriel and of the latter’s keen desire to come to an understanding with Monsieur Stas, and asked the Director-General if he could give his sub ordinate a hint which would expedite the commencement of friendly relations between the two. In reply Monsieur Heynssens remarked that without doubt Monsieur Stas would have followed previous practice and would have called on Lieutenant Gabriel had it not been for the baneful presence of “ the Russians ” (Monsieur Ovseenko); he added that though he hardly thought he could order Monsieur Stas to call, he would nevertheless give him a hint which he thought he would not fail to take. This the latter has not yet done ; in fact he has since committed his claim to first call to writing, but his absence from Bunder Abbas may account for the delay and I hope that on receipt of Monsieur Heynssens’ advice he will change his attitude. Meanwhile I have received your enquiry of I ith instant. 3. I now beg to refer you to the sketch map accompanying this letter and to make clear the following preliminary points:— (a) All the space between Bunder Abbas Town and the Cable is either heavy sand or marshy ground. (b) The place where the Cable is landed was selected by the Cable-lay ing experts of the Indo-European Telegraph Department as being the most suitable spot on the Bunder Abbass foreshore for theM (&lt;*) purpose, rocks in it possessing a sandy approach and freedom from ... the vicinity. It must be obvious even to the lay mind that from the point of view of the best interests of the public and of the trade of the port the only suitable position for a public Telegraph Office at Bunder Abbas is either in the midst of the Town itself or just outside whither people will have no distance to walk across the inhospita ble sand; it should certainly be no further off than the edge of the * —I.A R nr\ ttiA rdanV The portion of a cable between the point of landing and its Cable House should if possible be on the same direct alignment or bear ing as that on which it was landed. A slight curve might not be open to much objection, but a sharp curve, much less a right angle is objectionable for obvious reasons. 4. Now, if the Persian Government wish to place their Telegraph Office at the spot (marked C) selected by Monsieur Stas or any other practically absurd place, and wish thereby to give everyone who uses the office the trouble of walking out to it, to the undoubted detriment of telegraph receipts and the inconvenience of the public, then I suppose we can do no more than explain the position and let them follow their own short-sighted policy; but the location of the Cable House is a purely technical matter for expert determination and it seems to me unreasonable that they should attempt to dictate to the Telegraph Department on this point and to ignore their professional advice. The latest wish of the Persian Government as communicated in your telegram of 19th July, now is that a site for a combined Cable and Telegraph Office should be selected on a bearing west of the building forcibly commenced by Monsieur Stas. That would be at some point on the alignment D E of the plan. An examination of the latter will make it plain that such a site would be open to just the same expert objections as was the site of the first cable house, with the addition of the further prohibitive objection that in order to bring the cable there, the latter would have to describe a right-angle. This puts the pro posals out of court altogether, as the grave objections alluded to in your tele gram may be said to be clearly present. 5. As a means of final solution I have the honour to express the hope that— (a) by the light of the present plan you will see your way to explain the existing position to the Persian Foreign Office or Monsieur Naus, and to make one more attempt to persuade them, in the interests of the public, to have the Telegraph Office in Bunder Abbas Town ; ( 3 ) as to the Cable House or [if your efforts under (a) are abortive], the combined Cable House and Telegraph Office, I have no doubt that Director Indo-European Telegraphs would assent to have the Cable House on any of the curves F G H I J of the plan, so long as the spot chosen is not less than 400 yards from the sea, at the point where the Cable was landed. This 400-yard line is marked K L. 6. The sketch which I am am now forwarding is drawn on sectional paper with quarter inch squares, which have been numbered in such a way that by quoting the letters and numbers, thus “ F3 by U2 ” you can designate by telegram within a few feet, the precise site which in communication with the Persian Government you may consider likely to be most suitable. Duplicates of the sketch together with a copy of this letter are being sent to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas. Any spot which as the result of communication with the Persian Government, you may indicate by telegram inside the limits within which I have above presumed the acquiescence of the Director of Persian Gulf, Telegraphs, I have no doubt will be readily accepted by him in order to put an end to this dispute, but I would express the opinion that so far as Monsieur Stas is concerned, it is clear that3 / US + his attitude is prompted not by consideration for the public convenience or the efficiency of the Cable, but simply by the desire to achieve a score off our re- 4b!e tear. &gt;t be angle Office ically ouble 1 the n the in of nd it ^raph :gram Office d by f the Id be louse, ; the ; pro- tele- hope i the Naus, erests 'own; ;tive], /e no presentative, and that as long as he is permitted to continue to handle the matter it is hardly likely to arrive at a speedy settlement. From— Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Assistant Resident and His Majesty’s Consul, Bunder Abbas, To— CAPTAIN A. P. Trevor, I.A., First Assistant Resident, Persian Gulf. Please refer to your telegram No. 263. Impossible suggestions are persis tently made by the Persian Government in spite of the fact that they seem to be perfectly aware of the point of the case. I have consulted the Superintendent of 1 elegraphs here and as I expected learn from him that as the move westwards of Stas’ building is no further from the sea while nearer to the river, it is quite unacceptable. The whole point is that it is the desire of the Telegraph Depart ment to have the Cable end as far inland as possible, viz., in a northerly direc tion office being afterwards placed wherever desired though not in a position directly in front of the Consulate. This will apply whether the cable ends in a combined office and cable house or in a separate cable house. From— Lieutenant W. H. I.

In continuation of my telegram No. 159, dated 25th April 1906, I have the m . /i nnti. a honour to forward, for the information of the Government or India, a copy of a communication received from Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, LA., His Majes* ty’s Consul at Bander Abbas in which he explains the circumstances connected with his alleged refusal to interview Monsieur Stas. I also forward, in case the original was not repeated to the Government of India, a copy of Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 85, dated 24th April 1906, which gave rise to the correspondence* No. 300, dated Bander Abbas, the 30th April 1906. From— Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, I. A., Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Bander Abbas, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Fars, etc., Bushire, In continuation of my telegram w r ords 79, dated the 27th April and in ex planation of the obvious misunderstanding as to my action when attempting to bring to a satisfactory solution the present difficulties regarding the Telegraph connection at Bander Abbas, I have the honour to submit copies of the corres pondence which passed between Monsieur Stas and myself and after which I understand he reported that I had refused him an interview regarding the cable question. 2. To prevent any further misunderstanding it will be as well to record the sequence of events in this matter. On the 13th April I received your two telegrams Nos. 129 and 130 and during the afternoon was discussing their subject with Mr. Gabler in his tent near the proposed site, when Monsieur Stas himself came up. He broached the subject of the cessation of work on his previous buildings and of his having received orders regarding another site. As the three of us were on the spot I suggested we should go over the ground and try and settle the question. This was done and Mr. Gabler and I showed Monsieur Stas the spot indicated in your telegram No. 80 of 3rd April. He, however, insisted on another spot in an impossible place. We did our best to convince Monsieur Stas that his selection was impossible from a technical point of view, but without result. As it was getting dark I induced Monsieur Stas with some difficulty to return to Mr. Gabler’s tent in order that I might show him your telegram No. 129, Monsieur Stas then raised the point that his instructions told him to discuss the matter with me and said nothing about Mr. Gabler. I pointed out to Monsieur Stas that as far as I was concerned I would agree to any^ site approved by Mr. Gabler, as he was the only technical expert there provided it was not directly m front of the new Consulate, and to save our carrying on a three-cornered discussion I suggested his going over the whole ground again the next morning with Mr. Gabler when he would have more light to see and more leisure to appreciate the various technical points. Monsieur Stas agreed to this and then left. 4. Next morning the 14th April Monsieur Stas and Mr. Gabler exhaustively discussed the matter apparently without Monseiur Stas giving way at all on his absurd selection. He also before leaving gave Mr. Gabler to understand that he would bring his building-contractor in the afternoon that a mutually agree able site might be finally settled upon. On Mr. Gabler’s informing me of this and that he expected Monsieur Stas about 4 P*M., I went down especially to be present at the interview. Mr. Gabler and I waited until we had seen Monsieur Stas pass into his house and for some time more expecting him, C100FDJ until at ■t-to P. M. as there were no signs of his keeping his appointment and the ma er w 5 4 urgent 1 took Mr. Gabler with me to ca 1 on Mons.eur Stas. At h.s s.” if, i , „d S uu' ass; C* *• bd„ previously u.d h.d ool soso Mu. Id.ve ihough expecting hLat any moment for his appointment wth Mr. Gabier I was natu- raX sceftical and therefore on my arrival home I .mmed.ately sent, h.m a note of which 1 have the honour to enclose a copy : this was delivered on the 14th April evening I received an answer to this m the afternoon of the 15th Apr.l (copy enclosed) after which I sent you my telegram No C- 2 6 and also address another note to Monsieur Stas as he appeared to be e.ther evading or misunder- Standing me wilfully. In reply i received Monsieur Stas’ note of the 16th April a„d then as the mil steamer was in port which 1. des.red to board and remember- fug that perhaps Monsieur Stas might be expecting me Wc at er part of h.s note of 1 sth April) 1 wrote a hurried note to him of which unfortunately I have no copy, begging him not to await me as I would be going to the ma.I-steamer and my eturn would be uncertain and also as he had apparently already made up his own mind on the subject and had telegraphed h.s views to Teheran there did not appear to be any necessity for further discussion ; Monsieur Stas might be asked to produce this in original. I received a reply to this m the afternoon when 1 returned and presume this incident is what furnished Monsieur Stas with the idea of a refusal on my part to give him an interview. How far it is true I leave the attached correspondence to show. c Subsequently when I received your telegram of the 18th April, No. 144, I immediately wrote to Monsieur Stas and on receipt of his reply sent you my telegram No. C*28 j copies of these notes are attached. 6. On the 20th April Monsieur Stas again wrote to me as apparently some misunderstanding had arisen at Bushire. Copies of his letter and my reply are attached. The above closes my correspondence with Monsieur Stas on this subject. 7. After a careful perusal of the attached papers and a consideration of the sequence of events can it possibly be maintained that I refused to give Monsieur Stas an interview ? This incident shows to what extent rrisrepresen* tation as deliberate as it is malicious, has been carried in this matter of the Telegraph. 8. I beg that copies of this correspondence be furnished to His Majesty’s Legation to show that it is not my conduct which is incomprehensible but rather the extent to which misrepresentation, to use no stronger term, can on occasion be carried by Monsieur Stas. 9. I say nothing of how much Monsieur Stas has been guided in this matter by my Russian colleague as it is impossible to prove, but I may be permitted to mention that it is common talk in the town that since the Russian Consul’s arrival Monsieur Stas has made no move without consulting him, and that members of the Russian Consul’s staff were always behind the contractor and the workmen urging them to complete as quickly as possible the buildings against tvhich I had protested and which Monsieur Stas continued in spite of ail protests. 10. As His Majesty’s Legation have been shown a telegram grossly mis representing my action I trust it may be possible to insist on the withdrawal of the same and an apology from Monsieur Stas to me for the allegations be made. r Demi-official, dated the 14th April 1906. From— Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Bander Abbas, To— Monsieur Stas, the Director of Customs, Bander Abbas. 1 am sorry Mr. Gabler and I did not meet you this afternoon as I understood from Mr.Gabler that you were going to come up to his tent to settle about the Telegraph.I had brought down the other telegram which I had received from Teheran and which I was not able to show you yesterday. It is as follows “ The Administrator General of Customs is making enquiries from the Director of Customs at Bander Abbas whether there is any objection to placing combined Telegraph Office and Cable-house at spot indicated in your telegram No.^o’*. Telegram No. 80 l showed to you last evening in Mr. Gabler’s tent and it simply describes the place selected. Mr. Gabler tells me that he suggested another place to try and suit your views but that you insist on a place which is quite unsuitable. I was quite willing to asree to any place the Telegraph expert thinks is suitable for the cable from the spot Mr. Gabler selected is a few yards further for the Contractor to carry the stones. I shall be glad if you will inform me if you have any other objection in order that I may inform the Legation.

Your note was handed to me yesterday whilst I was on the road to the town, so I could not reply earlier. As I wrote to you in my note of the 19th I could not report definitely about the site for the telegraph buildings originally : but, when I got your reply of the 20th saying definitely that you agreed to the site selected by Mr. Gabler and known to me I again telegraphed at once to say this.

A telegram from the Director of Customs, Bandar Abbas, was^ produced by the Administrator of Customs stating that an interview regarding cable was refused by His Britannic Majesty’s_ Consul. If this is the case, the latter s conduct is altogether incomprehensible to me and I request that his explanation in writing be furnished me by you. G. C. Press, Simla.-No C-100 F.

COX, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sir Louis Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward for favour of perusal a copy of an official letter which Monsieur Heynssens, Director-General of Customs, has addressed to his deputy at Bunder Abbas, Monsieur Stas ; and in sending it to the Residency Surgeon for perusal has asked him to apprise me and my First Assistant of its purport. 2. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in a recent telegram to the Government of India and myself regarding the troublesome dispute now current in connection with the Bunder Abbas Cable-house expressed himself in terms which seemed rather to suggest that possibly as much tact and friendliness as might be, had not been displayed by our local officials. I do not think this is the case; on the contrary, Lieutenant Shakespear and Mr. Gabler appear to have received much provocation, and in the hope of removing any wrong impression that may have been formed, I have ventured to send Mr. Grant-Duff confidentially a copy of Monsieur Heynssens’s letter. It is known that Monsieur Stas has been acting in several matters in direct communication with Tehran independently of Monsieur Heynssens, his immedi ate chief, and he has apparently received sufficient support to make it worth his while to risk doing so ; but the local Director-General would hardly go so far as to address an official letter in such terms to his subordinate and let the Residency see the letter, if he did not think that the censure conveyed was badly needed on general grounds.

No bond fide reprimand was ever issued nor apology offered for this act.

On receiv ing instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 55, dated 26th March, Consul at Bunder Abbas asks me to explain that the matter must have been much exaggerated to you and it appears from his later reports that he used the word “guard” loosely and that the so-called guard which he placed on the spot on the .13th consisted of only one unarmed man. When Ms escort came up later a large number of Surbazes had already collected and his escort was never placed as a guard on the cable, hut was sent hack. He also pointed out that the cable had not been handed over and is still in charge of Telegraph Department and that Persians had already stopped work of Telegraph Superintendent by an armed force without explanation or warning and lastly that he had also been informed by me on your authority that the Mushir-ed- Dowleh had specifically ordered stoppage of work which led him to think that Mons. Stas instigated by the Russian Consul was acting in his own responsibility. Ends. Telegram,’'No. 105, dated the 3rd (received 4th) April 1906, From— Major P. Z.

Scrutiny of the former will make my reasons for wishing to stop it apparent. It appears that the news was received from Reuter’s Agent at Bunder Abbas by the mail which arrived at Bushire on the morning of the 26th instant, and Reuter’s local Agent has since expressed his regret for sending off the message without asking particulars from the Residency, excusing himself for doing so on the ground of press of work. My fear was that much annoyance would be caused to the Persian Govern ment and that as the result some discourtesy might be shown by the Persian authorities to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, who is on tour in the Persian Gulf and will arrive at Bushire on 1st proximo.

Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Following sent to Mr. Grant Duff to-day :— Begins. I have received your telegram of the 19th April. The present proposal to revert to the cable house, which the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, disapproved and demolished, will obviously be damaging to us politically as well as very objectionable to the Telegraph Department. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, moreover, will probably go on further at the next opportunity and say he really indicated the building which Stas was lately ordered to suspend. Is it not possible for you to effect the following arrangement definitely, seeing that the Persian Foreign Office wrote to you on the 25th March that the cable house would be chosen according to the opinion of the British Engineer, and that latter is present in the person of Mr. Gabler. If the Persian Government do not wish the telegraph office proper to be in the town of Bunder Abbas as desired by the public, then let Mons. Stas build it on the site mentioned in my telegram of the 3rd April and with any slight modification it may require and on the other hand let Mr. Gabler build his cable house where his Department think it will be best technically, provided it is on Persian soil as desired by the Persian Government. Mons. Stas has been, throughout this business, in collusion with the Russian Consul, and they have been aided by the mendacious tactics of the Mushir-ed- Dowleh in his negotiations with you. The object has been simply to ostentatiously score against our local officials, and our position at Bunder Abbas has been considerably damaged thereby already. I beg you therefore not to relax your efforts to secure finality in terms which can be accepted without further loss of prestige locally. JtLnds. Telegram, No. 176, dated the 24th April 1906. From—E.

Scrutiny of the former will make my reasons for wishing to stop it apparent. ; It appears that the news was received here from Reuter’s Agent, Bunder Abhas by the mail which ar rived at Bushire on the morning of the 26th instant, and Reuter's local agent has since expressed his re gret for sending off the message without asking particulars from the Residency, excusing himself for doing so on the ground of press of work. My fear was that much annoyance would be caused to the Persian Government and that as the result some His Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 7some discourtesy might he shown hy the Persian authorities to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- -Chiei* East Indies Station who is on tour in the the Persian Gulf and will arrive at Bushire on 1st proximo.

Sir With reference to my telegram No.78 of the 27th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the voluminous correspondence regarding a dispute which began in January last between the local authorities at Bunder Abbas and the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department on the subject of the location of the cable house of the wire connect ing Henjam and Bunder Abbas. You will remember that by the terms of the Agreement of 13th May, 1905, the Persian Government agreed to construct a Telegraph Office at Bunder Abbas and in spite of constant pressure on the part of His Majesty*s Legation and actual orders issued to the Minister of Telegraphs, that official took no steps to erect the promised station. In January it appears that the Government of India instructed His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire 81 r Edward Grey, Bart.BusMre to make arrangements with the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraph Section to establish the end of the cable quietly in a cable house on the site of His Majesty's Consulate at Bunder Abbas. The Gov ernment of India held that until the cost of the con struction of the line had been paid by the Persian Government, Paragraph 2 of the Agreement entitled them to retain control of the line. Later it was found that the position of the cable house was too close to the sea and it was moved to the extreme corner of the site of the Brit ish Consulate. This step was fully explained to the Persian local autnoritles who nevertheless without refer ence to His Majesty's Consul stopped the work, placed aii armed guard on the cable and Imprisoned the workmen and practically imprisoned the Superin tendent in his tent. Tnis action was reported to me by His Majes-Majesty's Consul General at Bushlre and I at once brougnt it to the notice of the Persian Government in rny note of 23rd January last. The Mushir ed Dov/leh promised to make enquiries and after much trouble, I obtained a reply on February 10th stat ing that the local authorities had interfered be cause the British officials desired to erect the cable nouse at a place which the Persian Government considered unsuitable. Of the action of the Bunder Abbas authorities in placing a guard on the cable and imprisoning the Superintendent His Excellency professed to know nothing, hut promised to reprimand the officials concerned after enquiry. It would appear that no reprimand was ever sent. His Excel lency also stated that the Governor of the Gulf Ports had been Instructed to proceed to Bunder Ab bas and select a site for the Telegraph Office. On February 10th and 15th, I again informed the Persian Government that the local authorities werewere still obstructing the British telegraph offi cials and on February 13th, I suggested as a pos sible solution of the difficulty that the cable should first pass through the British consulate end then be taken to the Persian Telegraph Station. In his note of February 16th, the Mushir ed Dowleh declined to accept this arrangement, but stated that the Persian Government were prepared to permit the British Consulate to be connected by wire with the Persian Telegraph Station. On February 23rd, Major Cox informed me that the expert sent by the Persians was inclined to support the view of our officials and that His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas suggested inac tion until the Persian expert/could communicate with Tehran. MattersMatters remained in statu quo till the 13th in- stant when Major Cox telegraphed to say that the Direc tor of Customs at Bunder Abbas had begun to build what was apparently the telegraph station right on the cable line in spite of the protest of His Majesty r s Consul who, I think unwisely, proceeded to place a guard on the cable. I at once saw the Mushir ed Dowleh who had appar ently not heard of the events at Bunder Abbas and His Excellency promised me in the presence of Abbas Kuli Khan to suspend the building until some arrangement could be arrived at between our officials and the Darya Beggi. In reply to the proposal of Lieutenant Shakespear to land a party from His Majesty’s Ship 'Fox 8 which happened to be visiting Bunder Abbas, I telegraphed that I considered such action most undesir able. The Mushir ed Dov/leh meanwhile heard and, I pre sume, reported to the Shah that a guard of Indian sol diers had been placed on the cable, as he sent me a messagemessage expressing indignation at this action and subsequently denied having promised to suspend the building at Bunder Abbas. I saw both His Excellency and the Head of the British Section of the Persian Foreign Office on several occasions and endeavoured to explain the difference between the cable house and the telegraph station and our undoubted right to be consulted on technical points connected with the telegraph line which we had undertaken to build at the request of the Persian Government. I also pointed out that the origin of the dif ficulties which had arisen lay first with the Per sian Government who had for months neglected to ful fil their engagement to build the telegraph house at Bunder Abbas and secondly with the local authorities who in spite of full explanations given previous to the moving of the cable house had been guilty of violence. His Excellency made the most of the ac tion of Lieutenant Shakespear in placing a guard on the cable saying that the honour of the Persian Gov ernmentGovernment was affected and that they were quite de termined to build the telegraph office and cable house where they chose. On the 25th instant I wrote to the Mushir ed Dow- leh’s son, who understands English well, exact parti culars as to where the British telegraph officials wished the telegraph station and the cable house placed and their objections to the sites chosen by the Per sian Government. From Hussein Khan's reply I gather that the Persian Government will not make difficulties about the cable house, but insist on erecting the tele graph station on the site they have chosen. I have now arranged with the Mushir ed Dowleh that the building which has been begun shall be con tinued for six days longer - this is, I understand, to heal the wounded honour of the Persian Government,- and that the work shall then be temporarily stopped pending further discussion of the matter in dispute. The difficulty of treating the question which was originally of merely local importance, has latterly been much increased by the month of Moharrem which is mademade like Ramazan an excuse for every kind of delay and obstruction. When the period of delay is over I shall continue to do my best to settle the matter. Tlie Mushir ed Dowleh has asked me to apply to the Government of India for the services of an electri cian who will be paid by the Persian Government to superintend the cable at Bunder Abbas. I at once complied with His Excellency's request and am await ing a reply from Calcutta. I have &amp;c., (Sighed) Evelyn Grant Duff.Enclos. No. in Mr E. Orant DufrjB desp. No. Mar eh. 06 Vraaelation.

In these circumstances I propose that the Henjan cable should first pass through the British Consulate at Bander Abbas, then back on the same posts to the shore and sub- seqaen-bly a.long the coast, to the Persian OTiico.

In reply I would point out that in the con vention it clearly states that thdpersian Govt, will erect the sa,id station. More than six months have elapsed since the convention was signed and although the Persian Gov't, have been repeatedly desired to proceed with the work no attempt has been made on their pa,rt to erect an oFFice.

According to the information receive^:the site of the Persian Telegraph office has been fixed near the Customs house and the Hen- jam line must be terminated in the Persian Tel. Office. Although the site has been fixed and there is no difficulty, the authorities will no doubt render the necessary assis tance. The proper authorities have been again instructed to that effect by telegraph. In your note of two days ago you referred to the tel. line between Tabriz and Julfa passing through the Russian Con sulate in the former td&gt;Mn. I made enquiries from the Min ister of Telegraphs on this point. He states that perhaps there Its a^Line between the tel. office and the Russian Consulate, but the tel. line does not pass through the Consulate. It is arranged that the line at Bander Abbas should terminate in the^ersian tel. off ice,but in order to give telegraph facilities to the British Consulate a line should be constructed between that place and the Persian tel. office so that it should not be against usage,but at the same time the wish of the Consulate be carried oyt. The proper authorities have also been instructed that if the tel. office cannot soon be completed ,they should take the line provisionally to the site selected for the building, establish the instrument and make a line to the Consulate pending the completion of the telegraph office ir^rder that they(the English Consular authorities)may not be kept waitingwaiting Under the present arrangements the parties can begin the work without -working and you will inform the proper au thorities of the arrangements above mentioned so that they may act accordingly.

As some misunderstanding appears to exist in regard to the matter I thought it best to write to you privately in order that yotii might explain the question to H.E. the Mushir-ed-Dowleh. 1. If the building on which M. Stas is at present engaged is intended for the cable-^ouse it is far too near the sea and does not in the opinion of our tel. experts give suffi cient security for the ca.ble or facility for the care of tha instruments. 2. The site suggested for the cite of the cable house by the British Director of the Gulf Section is 833 yards inland from the spot where the cable leaves the sea in a direction about 19 degrees west of north. 3. We suggest that the tel. office for reasons of public utility should be placed in any central position which the Persian Govt. ma,y choose in the town of Bander Abbas it self. AS the line will, when completed, and paid for, be the property of the Persian Govb. I submit that it bs surely to their interst to receive it from the British tel. au thorities in an efficient state.

The engineer whom, as you know, the Government intend to engage, will see about the matter and the spot where the cable house should be constructed will be chosen according to his opinion. Ax regards the telegraph station the Persian Government wishes that it should stand on the spot which they have chosen. In these conditions I suppose the telegraph Director will be satisfied.

'Consul at Bunder Abbas telegraphs as follows:- 'In my demi-official I ought to have added that as the Eoreign Department consider that we are entitled by paragraph 2 of hie Agreement to retain control of uhe lineline until the cost of its construction has been actually paid, the opening of an Office on behalf of the public on the new Consulate site cannot give rise to any objec- oi.n. Assistant Superintendent Lobo, with whom I inspec ted, tiie place, thinbs that the line along the shore is not so good as that which I suggested. The people are eagerly awaiting the opening of the line, but there are no signs of a Persian telegraphist. Could we not temporarily mstal one of our own men. There would be no difficulty in making a shelter of local materials and the cable at TT enjam is still only contained -n a wooden hut. Paraphrase of Bushire twl. of Jan. 25, 1906. As the provisional position of the cable-house at Bunder Abbas proved to be too close to the sea and did, not give adequate security for the cable, the Telegraph Superintendent was instructed by the Pepartment to move it further inland. The British Consul allowed him to make use of the extreme corner of the site of our new Consulate, which lies directly inland from the spot where the cable comes to shore. This was fully explained to the Deputy Governor and the Karguzar, but, without referring the matter to the Consul, they today put a stop to .he work, placed an armed guard, imprisoned the wcrkaen, and practically imprisoned the Superintendent in his tent. A protest was lodged by the Consul and all responsibility was thrown by the Governor on the Barguzar• The Tr arguzar at first pretended to be ill, but eventually declared that he was not responsible for the armed guard. The Superintendent hashas this evening been given permission to use the cable, bi^I in spite of constant protests, no work has been allowed on the cable house and the plant and wire are lying ex posed .. I beg to at a forcible protest against these ob structive tactics and against the employment of armed force may be made l. o txic; sxan Government and. that orders may he sent to the Governor and the Farguzar to immediately tender a written ap-clogy to the Superintendent through h* 1 ' .Consul and to offer no further obstruction to wor.k on the cable house but to permit its resumption at once.

Yesterday a telegram was received from Henjam saying tnat the Persians still maintained their guard on the ''under Abbas cable and that the Deputy Gover nor had again stopped, the Superintendent from using the wire at all since the evening of Feb. 6 and that all communication was now suspended. It is therefore obvious that the Mushir ed Bowleh's assertion as to a reprimand is untrue. I have, on the other hand, confidential reason to believe that peremptory orders were sent to maintain the obstruction until the Persian Representative should arrive. I trust that a copy of the alleged reprimand or an apology may be obtained. The exact area and position of the Consulate site were specified in an order issued by the Darya Beggi on Aug. 2nd and, in accordance with this order the site was formally marked out and handed over to the Consul by the 1 oca-1 authorities. Communication with Shakespear is cut off, but I would suggest that we might get over the difficulty, failing some more satisfactory arrangement, by cutting out from the Consulate site the small area on which the cable- house foundations are already laid. The area would thus cease to be British territory. Repeated to Government of India. Paraphrase of tel. to Bushire, Ho. 21, Feb. II, 1906. Your tel. Fo. 23.

The Director in Chief in London has sent the following Departmental tel. to the Director of Persian Gulf Te1egr aphs:- The Persiam Telegraph Department has, I find, always allowed its wire to he carried, for testing and general administrative purposes, through the offices of the Indo-European Department at Tehran, Isfahan, Iferman, Yezd, and Shiraz. I find also that, when necessary, these offices can cut off commuiiication on the wire.It thereofore seems to me that you should follow the same procedure when you have to construct the line to the Persian Offices at Bunder /'bhas ahd Henjam, and that the wire at Bunder Abbas, before being brought into the Persian Offices, should, be carried through cur Consulate, while that at Henjam should be brought through our Office there. It is possible that if we dc this as a technical telegraphic arrangement the Persians will raise no objec tions, and should they do so eventually you can point out to them why we adopted this course. We should treat this arrangement as the natural one for the efficient management of the line and should not ash for previous permission. The Persian wire between Djoulfa and Tehran, whichvv.filch, is carried on the Indo-European Companj^’s line, passes, sc I am informed, through the Russian Consulate ai Tanriz, so that precedents for carrying on a wire both through a Consulate and through a Departmental Offices may be brought forward by the political authorities, should any objections be raised. r he wire at Bunder Abbas would be carried first to the Consulate, then back to the shore on the same posts, and lastly to the Persian Office along che coast. Such signalling as was required at the Consu late could, I understand, be done by one of the Consulate clerks. The Persian Government , as you are doubtless aware, have notified that they are ready to pay the cost of the construction of the ''enjoin Bunder Abbas line. You snould ash the Examiner of telegraphic accounts to prepare the bill as quickly as possible.” The continuance of the present obstruction is creating an impression very damaging to British interests and I therefore hope that it will be possible to insist on the acceptance of the arrangement suggested above.

I presume that the Valiahd's order fixing and defining the site for the Consulate, which was enclosed in your despatch Do. 52 of Aug. 7 last, amounts to a firman and that no further document is required. Obstruction of local authorities to the completion of the telegraph extension still continues. Cable-house isis 'beinp; placed for safety and for tecnical reasons in a corner of the new Consulate site, and I would 'beg to poinc out that, it is to the construction of this building that obstruction is being raised. The telegraph Office can be pla*ced at any point which the Persian Authorities may select and after the completion of the cable house a land line can be run from it to the telegraph Office. The cable-house, as you are no doubt aware, is quite distinct from the Office and is merely the po^-int at which the current is transferred to the land-line from the submarine cable.lt was only proposed that the cable- house should be used for the receipt of messages tempora rily until such time as arrangements should, be made for fixing the site of the telegraph Office. (see tel. ho. 161 P.A. from Govt, of India of Jan. 13th.) The Darya 13eggi is now at Bunder Abbas and I would respectfully urge that the Persian Govt, be pressed to order him to put a stop to his obstruction at once, to punish his subordinates, and to allow the cable-house to be completed at new Consulate site.

Repeated to India. It would, appear from reports which I have just received from Bunder Abbas that the cable-house and the Telegraph Office are still confused in the minds of the Persian Authorities. As long as their Telegraph Office does not prejudice the amenities of our Consulate site they may place it where they please. The selection of the site of the cable-house, which is a small shelter for the reception of the end of the cable, is a purely techni cal question and one which, the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in consultation, if necessary, with a Persian Telegraph expert, should decide. But the Persian expert has neglected or refused ^o consult witn. uhe Director, although the latter has twice visited Bunder Alohas for this purpose. It is obvious that the .telegraph Department cannot complete or hand, over tr,e line an oil ur.e settlement, to their reasonable satisfaction, of tne question of the site of the cable-nouse, although ohej ar^ willing to meet the wishes of the Persian Government as far as compa mhle with their technical req ire men ',s • I am expecting the final views of the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs by post.

Bunder Ahhas meanwhile telegraphs today that a site measuring 45 paces 'by 30 has 'been selected hy the Director of Customs. This lies right on the cable- line between the first and second cable-house sites and is apparently intended for the Telegrap Office. In spite of ':he Consul’s protests the Director of Customs insists upon starting building operations at once. The Consul urgently begs support and that a stop may be put to the arbitrary action of the Director of Customs. I trust you will see your way to mnforming the Mushir ed Dowleh that wli while we do not desire to insist upon the cable-house being built within our Consulate limits if the Persian Govern ment object to such a course, on the other hand there is no reason why the telegraph experts of both parties in communication should not come to an amicable and deliberate settlement of the question of the site of the cable-house, and, moreover, that the only result of further interference on the part of the Director of Customs and the endeavour to force through some arrangement not acceptable to the Telegraph Department will be to delay the completion and delivery of the line. It might also produce some unpleasant local incident, which would presumably not be pleasing to the Persian Government. Paraphrase of tel. from Bushire, Ho. 47, / arch 13, It06. In continuation of my immediately preceding tel.I .nave just received a tel. from Consul at Bunder Atfbas from which ic would appear that , in spite of the protest lodged by the Consul on behalf of the Telegraph Superintendent, Birector of Customs has again recommenced building. A guard was therefore placed on the cable by the Consul, but, on tne Persians bringing up a number of soldiers, it was withdrawn, and the Consul filed a protest against the use of force. H.M.S. 'Pox' is shortly to visit Bunder Abbas in connection with the arms raffic and the Consul asks to be authorized to request the Commander to land a party and to inform the local authorities that, pending further instructions, he has orders to prevent building operations. Tomorrow morning I will interview Director Gene ral of Customs and will endeavour to arrange that pending the receipt of your reply the work should be temporarily suspended. I have meanwhile told the Consul not to ask the Commander of the 'Pox' to intervene without further instructions from me. The pecuniary loss resulting from the erection of building in an unsuitable place will of course fall upon the Persian Government and not on us, but 4 a&amp;ttthe same time it is very humiliating that the local authorities should continue their building by force in \ the face of the Consul’s explanations and I think it urgent that we should insist on the suspension of building pending settlement in order to support the Consul. -'-he question of the cable-house siue can easily be setoled amicably, and, as I have before stated, ohere is no violent hurry.

The Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s assertion regarding reprimand is, therefore, obviously untrue, and on the contrary I have confidential reason to believe that peremp-2 torv orders were sent, pending the arrival of the Persian representative, for maintenance of the obstruction.

I have sent the following departmental telegram from the Director-in- Chief, London, to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, to Tehran, for the information of His Brttannic Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires :— Begins. I find the Persian Telegraph Department has always allowed its wire to be carried through the departmental offices at Shiraz, Ispahan, Tehran, Yezd, and Kerman for testing and general administrative purposes, and that, wffien necessary, these offices can cut off communication on it. It appears to me therefore that the same proce dure should be followed when you have to construct the line to the Persian offices at Henjam and Bunder Abbas, and that the wire at Hen jam should be carried through our office there and through our Consulate at Bunder Abbas, before being brought into the Persian offices. If this is done as a technical telegraph arrangement it is possible no objection will be raised, and should objections be made afterwards, you can point out why it was done. We should not ask for previous permission to carry outwork in this way, but treat arrange ment as the natural one to make for the efficient management of the line. I am informed that the Persian wire between Tehran and Djoulfa carried on the Indo-European Company’s line passes through the Russian Consulate at Tabriz, so if objections are raised the political authorities wfill have precedents to show both for carrying on wire through departmental office and a Consulate at Bunder Abbas. The wire w r ould be carried to the Consulate, then back on the same post to the shore, and afterwards along the coast to the Persian Office. I understand that one of the Consulate clerks w T ould do what signalling w T as wanted there. You are aware that the Persian Government have notified that they are ready to pay the bill of exchange for the cost of the wire from Henjam to Bunder Abbas. The Examiner, Telegraph Accounts, should be asked to expedite its preparation. I hope it will be possible to insist on the acceptance of the arrangement now suggested, as an impression very damaging to us is created by the con tinuance of the present obstruction.3 r (Received on the 13th February 1906 with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated the 26th January 1906.)

Note by the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated the loth January 1906. The Consul at Bunder Abbas proposes that the cable connection at Bunder Abbas should be carried through the British Consulate there before it is carried into the Persian Office. At Shiraz, Ispahan, Tehran, Yezd, and Kerman, we carry the Persian wire into the departmental telegraph offices, and are able to cut off communication on it. This is done for testing and general administrative purposes, and the Persian Minister of Telegraphs has never objected. My recommendation is to allow the question of the wire at Bunder Abbas being passed through the Consulate there to be treated as a simple technical one of telegraph manage ment. The wire both at Bunder Abbas and Henjam should be carried through our offices at these places and then into the Persian Office. I propose to tell the Director of Telegraphs at Karachi to arrange for this to be done. If the Persians raise objections afterwards we can poin to the arrangements at Shiraz and the other offices I have mentioned to explain our action. H. A. Kirk. Telegram, dated the 14th February 1906.

I beg to point out that obstruction is being offered to erection of cable house which for safety and technical reasons is being placed in corner of new Consulate site. When it is completed, land line can be run from it to telegraph office which can he placed at any spot selected by the Persian authorities. r As vou are no doubt aware, the cable house is merely the point at which the current from the submarine cable is transferred to the land line and is quite distinct from office. It was only proposed to receive messages at the cable house temporarily pending fixing of site of telegraph office vide Government of India telegram No. 161 E.-A., dated 13 th January. I respectfully urge that the Persian Government may be pressed to order Derya Be°i who is now at Bunder Abbas to put a stop to obstruction at once, punish hhf subordinates, and allow the cable house to be completed at the Consulate site.

It being found that the provisional position of t cable house at Bunder Abbas was too close to the sea and did not render the cable secure, the Telegraph Superintendent received Departmental instructions to shift it further iniano and the British Consul allowed him to use the extreme corner of our new site directly inland, the spot where the cable is landed. In spite of full explanation to the effect, the Deputy Governor and the Foreign Office Agent, without further reference to the Consul, stopped work today, imprisoned the workmen, placed an armed guard, practically making the Superintendent a prisoner in his tent. On the Consul lodging a protest, the Governor threw the responsi bility upon the Foreign Office Agent, and the latter at first feigned illness, but eventually disavowed the res ponsibility of the armed guard. The Superintendent has, after repeated protests, been permitted to use the cable thisthis evening hut no work on the cable house is allowed, and the wire and plant are lying exposed. I beg that a forcible protest may be made to the Persian (rovernment against the employment of an armed force and other obstruction, and that the Foreign Office Agent and the (rovernor may be ordered to offer an immediate written apology to the Telegraph Superintendent through the Consul, and to allow, without further obstruction, the resumption of work on the cable house.

To the Hen jam end of the line being worked by the English office; 2. To the formal insertion of the provision that no foreign subjects, except tnose in the service of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, should he employed on the line, against which lie wrote, “ No, we must he free ” ; and 3. To the English telegraphist at Bun der A bba s.X succeeded, with, tue help oi the JVTushir-ed-Dowleh, in oyercomiu 01 the two latter objections, hut the Shah was obstinate about the first, and although I pointed out in the note, of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith, that he would be merely throwing money into the sea by keeping up a Persian’ office at Henjam side by side with the English one, only to do the same work twice over, he said he would provide it out of Persian funds and had given orders that M. Nans should erect the building. M. Nans, I may observe, says that no such order has been received by him and that he would be very much embarrassed as to how to execute it. After discussing the matter with Mr. New, chief of the Persian section Indo- European Telegraph Department, who was of opinion that the existence of a Persian office side by side with ours would make no difference whatever, I decided, subject to your Lordship’s approval, to accept the Persian amendment. It is, as your Lordship will observe, clumsily worded; the Persian expression “raje be kharejeh,” is untrans- lateable, as its literal meaning is “ relating (or belonging) to foreign,” but my Oriental experts say that what it really means is, “ messages for or from abroad”; messages for or from abroad, from, but apparently not to, Bunder Abbas, having to pass through the Persian office, I thought it, however, wiser to let it pass as it stood, without attempting to render it more lucid or precise. The point would never have been raised had I not been instructed by your Lordship to specially stipulate for the Henjam end of the line being worked in the English office, for this followed by implication from Article 1 of the Agreement which provides for a line u connecting the Indo-European station at Henjam ” with Bunder Abbas, a provision which will enable us to terminate the line in our own office, letting it pass through, or effect a junction with, the Persian office, and to some extent to control the latter. A few other verbal alterations were introduced in compliance with the Shah’s wishes, i.e., in Article 1 the word “ temporarily,” and “ after which they shall return,” which were evidently dictated by the intense Persian suspicion of our political designs and to guard against a permanent occupation of Kishm by British signallers or telegraph ships. Whether the Persian office or staff will be provided, at least in the near future, seems to me problematical. I have repeatedly asked permission from the Persian Government to erect or repair (i.e., in Seistan) caravanserais, or to execute other public works for the convenience of our traders, and the answer has always been that “ the Persian Government will do the work at its own expense.” Months have passed, however, in spite of repeated reminders from the Legation, without anything being attempted to give effect to these promises, or, if an attempt is made, the Persian official sent to carry it out drives the labourers obtainable away, as actually happened in the case of a kanat for our telegraph station at Nasratabad Sipeh (Kerman), by robbing them of their wages, or pretending that he has been sent to extort an extra tax from their village. The Ain-ed-Dowleh has, I imagine, no wish to waste money in the present critical state of the finances on useless luxuries, and if when the line is epened next autumn—it cannot now be begun till after the hot weather—the Shah asks him about the Persian office, he will probably content himself with replying that “ the necessary orders have been issued,” and we may hear no more about the matter. The practical difficulties will be considerable as the Arab villages of Henjam already resent the presence of the Persian customs Mirza, and I have been in correspondence with the Government of India as to the effect which may be produced on their relations with our telegraph station by our protection of this representative of Persian authority. Of course, the situation will be greatly modified if Henjam should become, as Dr. Schneider is urging the Shah to make it, an international sanitary station under the protection of the Persian flag. It may also be anticipated that the new Hussian Consul at Bunder Abbas will make an attempt, notwithstanding Article I of the Agreement, to introduce a Prussian signaller into the office there. My Bussian colleague tells me that the opening of the Bunder Abbas Consulate is not likely to take place immediately and that it is not yet decided who will be appointed to it, though M. Ovsenko, now Bmssian Consul in Seistan, is mentioned as a likely candidate. X Xiciv© czc. (Signed) ’ ABTHUR H. HARDINGE.lit w mm 102 Inclosure 1 in No. 122.

Inclosure 2 in No. 122. Sir A. Hardinge to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Your Excellency, Tehran, April 29, 1905. WITH reference to our recent conversations, I have the honour to inform you that I accept the insertion in Article 1 of the Bunder Abbas Telegraph Agreement of the word “ movaggatan ” which you were ordered by His Majesty the Shah to introduce into it. The other alteration desired by His Majesty, namely, the provision that there should he a Persian Government office at Ilenjam side by side with the Indo- European telegraph office, is less easy to give effect to, as the estimates made by the British Government did not contemplate two offices on Henjam, and will therefore have to he revised. Erom our point of view, the chief inconvenience of two offices will moreover be, firstly, that every message going to or coming from Bunder Abbas will he delayed by the necessity of transmission from the Persian to the Indo-European office; and.103 secondly, tliat there is only barely enough water in the tanks at Heniam excavated sLh e + f ’ ap Vmrtment, when it established its station in the ZeoTZlatl ^ Th° 111 summer, for the necessities of that station itself. 4 , ]e 1 C , Ust ) oms n ^ lr . za ’ as J ouv Excellency is aware, has now asked to use the teiegraph tanks, and, m ^accordance with M. IS T aus’ wish, the telegraph officials are supplying him with water wherever possible, but the water difficulty will be a good deal increased if a second telegraph station has to be supplied as well. I am inquiring as to the extra cost which the establishment of such a station e o nt :^ 011 tlle Eersjan Government. The estimate for the Bunder Abbas station was S,oOO rupees (or o,400 tomans). It may be presumed that, allowing for the expense of bringing materials and labourers from Bunder Abbas to Henjam, a similar smtion could be built on that island for a little more, say, at most, 4,000 tomans, wmen would have to be added to the estimate of 75,000‘rupees. This does not hem ever, provide for the necessity of digging fresh wells or bringing water from e.sovheio, or condensing it, all of wdiich may involve additional—and at present ohjcetion irom tbe Persian point of view seems to me to be that this aadnoona station is lixely to absorb for a good many years all the profits accruing iom t ic me lo ine lersian ireasury, and will oblige me to reconsider the statement w icn i made m an omciai note last summer that it would prove financially advan- tageons. Assuming the upkeep of the station to he the same as that allowed for at Bunder Abbas, we get an annual charge of 6,100 rupees, or about 2,560 tomans for eac a kj a ? e i °p ^ total of 5, l 20 tomans a-year, plus 600 tomans for upkeep and repairs, saj, a total or 0,120 comans a-year. The line ought to earn this in order that the I eisuii .Treasury should not lose by it, and it may he hoped that at some future date it will do so, out for the next few years this is hardly possible. It is very difficult to calculate wdiar it realty will earn at first, and it is only by a further reference to Inaia that I can get the figures necessary to arrive at an approximate calculation. But Mr. JS ew, m a note of which I inclose a translation, tells me that the Persian office at Bushire earns about 120/'. a month, hut that the whole earnings are probablv a little greater. We may, therefore, put them at 135/. a month, or 0, 720 tomans a-year. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the two stations at Bunder Abbas and Ilenjam earn together one-third of this amount we get a yearly revenue of 3,2 i0 tomans, and deducting 600 tomans for annual recurring charges, we eret a yearly revenue of 2,640 tomans a-year. This, however, will only just pay for the single station at Bunder Abbas, together with the upkeep of the line, whereas if to it is ^ added a second station at Henjam, the loss to the Persian Treasury will he 2,560 tomans a-year, or a little more than half the total revenue, and in view of the difficulty of getting Persian employes acquainted with foreign languages to reside, except for high pay, on an unwholesome and desert island like Henjam, probably more. It is therefore worth considering whether any advantage whatever beyond the doubtful one of causing half an-hour’s delay for each telegram, will he gained by the throwing away of some 3,000 tonans a-year in order that two sets of men should do twice over the work which one set of them could do in half the time. It will he remembered that Henjam can never he a real terminal station, as it has no traffic or population of its own, and every message which passes into the Persian station there from or to any other part of Persia must also pass over the Indo-European line and through the Indo-European station, since between Henjam and Bushire there is no Persian telegraph line as there is between Bushire and Tehran, but only the English submarine cable; further, the indirect increase of revenue which the Persian Government will derive as time goes on owing to Bunder Abbas becoming a telegraph station and thus an increased centre of trade, will not he helped by a second station on Henjara, which can never he more productive than it is at present. To establish such a second station would he almost like paying an expensive staff to intercept all telegrams passing between Bushire and Tehran or Tehran and Jtesht at Kushk-i-Nasrat, Chajipar Khaneh, or at Kerej or Yengi Imam. I cannot therefore but think that your Excellency has not adequately explained to His Majesty the object and nature of my Government’s proposal, and that it has been suspected that it was not merely intended to secure rapidity of telegraphic communication, hut either to acquire for political purposes a knowledge not otherwise obtainable, by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, of all messages which might pass to and from Bunder Abbas, or else to deprive the Persian Government for the benefit of the Indo- European Telegraph Department of a portion of the profits of the new line.

When I ascertain exactly what the additional cost of such a station with tne necessary wells and water supply will be, the charges for the woiks might be added to the amount guaranteed by the Persian Treasury for the construction of the entire line. It mi'dih for instance, be possible to reduce the expenses by uniting both offices in a single building, or else, as has been suggested by Mr. !\eiv, by a division between the Persian and English staffs at Henjam of the hours of the day during which each shall have the use of the line, and the final sctt.ement of these details micht be reserved for further discussion.

Lieutenant Shakespear, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas, met me at Henjam on the 14 th October, after Cable Section between Henjam and Deristan bad been laid and proceeded in the Patrick Stewart to Suza and Kishm. Erom Kishm he left in his own boat and proceeded to Bunder Abbas where, through his assistance, permission was obtained from the Governor to land the cable there. 3 . The site for the Cable House at Bunder Abbas has been fixed on the beach just off the site where the British Consulate will be built. 4 . The construction of the land line on Kisbm Island under charge of Khan Sahib Hussan Khan, a retired Artificer of this Department, has now commenced. ELECTRICIAN’S REPORT. Henjam-Bunder Abbas Telegraph Line. Sanctioned ly the Secretary of State for India in Council under Estimate No. 1 B.A., 1905 - 1906 . The cable connections of this line as shown in the diagram accompanying this report are Henjam-Deristan 1*579 knots laid on the 14 th October and Kishm-Bunder Abbas 13*583 knots laid on the 17 th October 1905 with expenditure of 15*172 knots of cable exceeding the estimate by 0 T 72 of a knot. This excess could not be avoided, as a larger amount of slack had to be kept at Bunder Abbas as the Cable House at that place will be erected further away from the beach than was anticipated. 3 . Before arrival at Henjam ( 12 th October) the Assistant Superintendent in charge of the Station was ordered to have boats in readiness to land stores at Heujam and Deristan and to have 50 coolies ready to help in landing cable ends and dig trenches. On the 7 th October the Political Besident, Bushire, wired saying that the British Minister at Teheran informed him that orders to the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports had been issued to render assistance in landing cable ends and stores, and that it was required a Persian Telegraph Official should accompany the construction party and meet the ship at Henjam—otherwise he thought the Persians would give trouble—that orders were issued to construct2 the Bunder Abbas Office. The Besident asked for my views on ihe matter. ~ I replied that there was no objection to the Persian Telegraph Official accom panying the construction party on the Island of Kishm and at Bunder Abbas, provided his arrival at Henjam would not delay work. That the cable connec tions would be completed by the 16 th or 17th October and ship then leave for Karachi. 3 . The Sheikh of Kishm through his Secretary had the boats and coolies ready at Henjam on the ship’s arrival as requested by the Assistant Superin tendent, Henjam Station, but refused to allow stores or cable end to be landed at Deristan without direct orders from the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Political Resident was informed of this by telegram and requested to have telegraphic orders sent to the Sheikh and also to the Governor of Bunder Abbas. These orders were received on the 14 th October, but as the ship was engaged on survey of the passage across from Henjam to Deristan and fixing sites for landing cable ends at both places, no actual delay took place. Previous to the receipt of these orders, I had, however, arranged with the Sheikh’s Secretary to land stores and cable end at Deristan and then wait for orders. The cable connection between Henjam and Deristan was laid by 6 p.m. of the 14 th October. 4 As hire of boats and wages of coolies were excessive and exceeding the estimate (none being procurable at Henjam) in consultation with the Khan Sahib decided to land portion of the line material at Shuza, a place between Henjam and Kishm and 11 miles distant from Deristan, so as to reduce expenditure in distribution. On the 15 th October material for 15 miles of line was landed at Shuza and ship proceeded to Kishm. At 7 a.m. on the 16 th October arrived at Kishm. The Sheikh of that place called on board; presented him with a gold watch and chain, provided by the Political Resident, and then returned his call. The Sheikh was very friendly and gave all assistance in landing stores and provided the requisite number of coolies at Kishm. He promised to send one of his headmen with the Khan Sahib to provide transport and labour during construction work on the Island. At 3-40 p.m. Kishm shore end was laid and ship proceeded to Bunder Abbas where sbe anchored for the night. 5 . Jn the 17 th October landed at Bunder Abbas and fixed site of the Cable House which is to be one mile distant from the centre of the town to the eastward. This site was fixed so as to be clear of the anchorage which extends for of a mile on either side of the centre of the town. The Governor : of the place refused to give assistance or permission to land the cable end. 1 t ^ le distance of Lieutenant Shakespear, His Majesty’s Consul, this iffieulty was, however, got over after some time and permission obtained. ihe Go Z ernor con ^ eD fi e( i that the telegram he received from the Governor o t le Gulf Ports was insufficient authority and that he required written mstruct.ous. It was explained to him the delay to the ship would mean rT Af 0 ^ da 7» he would no doubt be forced to pay this. It seems that the Belgian Customs authorities urged him to prevent the cable being w 1 ? A ;^ ^ ble end , was . taken ashore and Kishm Bunder Abbas Sectior completed at 5-50 p.m. and ship steamed for Henjam. 11-30 p.m. arrived Henjam, landed the Khan Sahib and ship proceedec to carry out the work required by the Foreign Department. The First Assistant to the Resident at Bushire wired to me on the ISt! October saying that as the local authorities at Bushire had said nothing about a .

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne .— {Received June 5.) (No. 104.) I ^ My Lord, . Tehran, May 15, 1905. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith, with reference to your Lordship’s telegram No. 48 of the 12th instant, a copy of the Agreement which, as reported in ^ my telegram No. 65 of the 13th instant, I signed on that day with the Musliir-ed- Dowleh for the construction of a telegraph line from Henjam to Bunder Abbas. When my draft was first submitted by his Excellency to the Shah, His Majesty objected— 1. To the Henjam end of the line being worked by the English office; 2. To the formal insertion of the provision that no foreign subjects, except those in the service of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, should be employed on the line, against which he wrote, “ No, we must be free ” ; and 3. To the English telegraphist at Bunder Abbas. I succeeded, with the help of the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, in overcoming the two latter objections, but the Shah was obstinate about the first, and although I pointed out in the note, of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith, that he would be merely throwing money into the sea by keeping up a Persian office at Henjam side by side with the English one, only to do the same work twice over, he said he would provide it out of Persian funds and had given orders that M. Nans should erect the building. M. Naus, I may observe, says that no such order has been received by him and that he would be very much embarrassed as to how to execute it. Alter discussing the matter with Mr. New, chief of the Persian section Indo- European Telegraph Department, who was of opinion that the existence of a Persian office side by side with ours would make no difference whatever, I decided, subject to your Lordship’s approval, to accept the Persian amendment. It is, as your Lordship will observe, clumsily worded; the Persian expression “ raje be kharejeh,” is untrans- lateable, as its literal meaning is “ relating (or belonging) to foreign,” but my Oriental experts say that what it really means is, “ messages for or from abroad”; messages for or from abroad, from, but apparently not to, Bunder Abbas, having ^ to pass through the Persian office. I thought it, however, wiser to let it pass as it stood, without attempting to render it more lucid or precise. The point would never have been raised had I not been instructed by your Lordship to specially stipulate for the Henjam end of the line being worked in the English office, for this followed hj implication from Article 1 of the Agreement which provides for a line “ connecting the Indo-European station at Henjam ” with Bunder Abbas, a provision which will enable us to terminate the line in our own office, letting it pass through, or effect a junction with, the Persian office, and to some extent to control the latter. A few other verbal alterations were introduced in compliance with the Shah’s wishes, i.e., in Article 1 the word “temporarily,” and “after which they shall return,” which were evidently dictated by the intense Persian suspicion of our political designs and to guard against a permanent occupation of Kishm by British signallers or telegraph ships. Whether the Persian office or staff will be provided, at least in the near future, seems to me problematical. I have repeatedly asked permission from the Persian Government to erect or repair {i.e., in Seistan) caravanserais, or to execute other public works for the convenience of our traders, and the answer has always been that “ the Persian Government will do the work at its own expense. ’ Months have passed, however, in spite of repeated reminders from the Legation, without anything being attempted to give effect to these promises, or, if an attempt is made, the Persian official sent to carry it out drives the labourers obtainable away, as actually happened in the case of a kanat for our telegraph station at Nasratabad Sipeh (Kerman), by [2030 e —6 ]2 robbing them of their wages, or pretending that he has been sent to extort an extra tex from their village. The Ain-ed-Dowleh has, I imagine, no wish to waste money n the present criticll state of the finances on use ess uxunes and if when the me s opened next autnmn-it cannot now be began till after the hot weather-the Shah ask him about the Persian office, he will probably content himself with replying that “ the necessary orders have been issued,” and we may hear no more about the matter. The practical difficulties will be considerable as the Arab villages of Henjam already resent the presence of the Persian customs Mirza, and I have been m correspondence with the Government of India as to the effect which may be produced on their relations with our telegraph station by our protection of this representative of Persian authority. Of course, the situation will be greatly modified if Henjam should become, as Dr. Schneider is urging the Shah to make it, an international sanitary station under the protection of the Persian flag. _ .. It may also be anticipated that the new .Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas will make an attempt, notwithstanding Article 4 of the Agreement, to introduce a Russian signaller into the office there. My Russian colleague tells me that the opening of the Bunder Abbas Consulate is not likely to take place immediately and that it is not yet decided who will be appointed to it, though i'l. Ovsenko, now Russian Consul in Seistan, is mentioned as a likely candidate. I have &amp;c (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Agreement respecting Construction of Telegi aph Line from Henjam to Bunder Abbas. HIS Excellency the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia and Sir Arthur Hardinge, His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, representing the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India, on the other part duly authorized thereto by their respective Governments, has concluded the following Agreement:— 1. The Persian Government having resolved to construct a line of telegraph to connect the Indo-European Telegraph station at Henjam with Bunder Abbas across Kishm, and His Majesty’s Government having authorized the Indo-European Telegraph Department to provide the engineers and materials necessary for the construction, it is agreed that two European engineers with the necessary employes and labourers shall be temporarily placed by the Department for the purpose at the disposal of the Persian Government, and that the telegraph ship belonging to the Department shall, as soon as the season permits, lay the two submarine ends between Henjam and Bunder Abbas respectively, and after completing the work they shall return. 2. As soon as the line is complete and the cost of materials and charges of the engineers and telegraph ship have been paid, the line shall be handed over to the Persian Ministry of Telegraphs. The Persian Government shall also have a telegraph office built at Henjam at their own cost, and appoint Persian telegraphists. The Bunder Abbas line shall be connected with the Persian telegraph office at Henjam, and all messages for abroad which are received from Bunder Abbas, and which are to be communicated by the English telegraph office at Henjam, shall be received by the Persian telegraph office and immediately transmitted to the English telegraph office. 3. The charges to be made by the Indo-European Department for the services of the engineers and telegraph ship shall not exceed 75,000 rupees, and the payment of the above sum is guaranteed by the Persian Government. 4. The declaration of the Persian Government that it will not employ foreign, i.e., non-Persian, subjects in the working of the line shall be held to preclude it from employing at the usual charges such subjects in the service of the Indo-European Telegraph Department for any repairs to the submarine cables or other works which may be necessary in connection with the maintenance and upkeep of the line, nor from allowing at the Bunder Abbas office a British signaller to deal with Statemessages sent on behalf of the British Government to and from its Consulate at Bunder Abbas, should the British Government desire it.

Signature of Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Your Excellency, Tehran, April 29, 1905. WITH reference to our recent conversations, I have the honour to inform you that I accept the insertion in Article 1 of the Bunder Abbas Telegraph Agreement of the word &lt;e movaggatan ” which you were ordered by His Majesty the Shah to introduce into it. The other alteration desired by His Majesty, namely, the provision that there should be a Persian Government office at Henjam side by side with the Indo- European telegraph office, is less easy to give effect to, as the estimates made by the British Government did not contemplate two offices on Henjam, and will therefore have to be revised. Prom our point of view, the chief inconvenience of two offices will moreover be, firstly, that every message going to or coming from Bunder Abbas will be delayed by the necessity of transmission from the Persian to the Indo-European office; and, secondly, that there is only barely enough water in the tanks at Henjam excavated by the Telegraph Department, when it established its station in the time of the late 8hah, to suffice, especially in summer, for the necessities of that station itself. The Customs mirza, as your Excellency is aware, has now asked to use the telegraph tanks, and, in accordance with M. Naus’ wish, the telegraph officials are supplying him with water wherever possible, but the water difficulty will be a good deal increased if a second telegraph station has to be supplied as well. I am inquiring as to the extra cost which the establishment of such a station will entail on the Persian Government. The estimate for the Bunder Abbas station was 8,500 rupees (or 3,400 tomans). It may be presumed that, allowing for the expense of bringing materials and labourers from Bunder Abbas to Henjam, a similar station could be built on that island for a little more, say, at most, 4,000 tomans, which w~ould have to be added to the estimate of 75,000 rupees. This does not, however, provide for the necessity of digging fresh wells or bringing water from elsewhere, or condensing it, all of which may involve additional—and at present uncertain—charges. A greater objection from the Persian point of view seems to me to be that this additional station is likely to absorb for a good many years all the profits accruing from the line to the Persian Treasury, and will oblige me to reconsider the statement which I made in an official note last summer that it would prove financially advan tageous. Assuming the upkeep of the station to be the same as that allowed for at Bunder Abbas, we get an annual charge of 6,400 rupees, or about 2,560 tomans for each place, or a total of 5,120 tomans a-year, plus 600 tomans for upkeep and repairs, say, a total of 5,720 tomans a-year. The line ought to earn this in order that the Persian Treasury should not lose by it, and it may be hoped that at some future date it will do so, but for the next few years this is hardly possible. It is very difficult to calculate what it really will earn at first, and it is only by a further reference to India that I can get the figures necessary to arrive at an approximate calculation. But Mr. New, in a note of which I inclose a translation, tells me that the Persian office at Bushire earns about 120/. a month, but that the whole earnings are probably a little greater. We may, therefore, put them at 135/. a month, or 9,720 tomans a-year. Assuming, for the sake of argument that the two stations at Bunder Abbas and Henjam earn together one-third of this amount, we get a yearly revenue of 3,2t0 tomans, and deducting 600 tomans for annual recurring charges, we get a yearly revenue of 2,640 tomans a-year. This, however, will only just pay for the single station at Bunder Abbas, together with the upkeep of the line, whereas if to it is added a second station at Henjam, the loss to the Persian Treasury will be4 9 tomans a-vear or a little more than half the total revenue, and in view of the difficuUy of getting Persian employes acquainted with foreign languages to reside, except for high pay, on an unwholesome and desert island like Henjam probably more It is therefore worth considering whether any advantage whatever beyond he doubtful one of causing half an-hour’s delay for each telegram, will be gained by the throwing away of some 3,000 tonans a-year in order that two sets of men should do wicc over the work which one set of them could do m half the time. It will he remembered that Henjam can never he a real terminal station, as it has no traffic or population of its own, and every message which passes into the Persian station there from or to anv other part of Persia must also pass oyer the Indo-European line and through the Indo-European station, since between Henjam and Buslure there is no Persian telegraph line as there is between Bushire and Tehran, but only the English submarine cable; further, the indirect increase of revenue which the Persian Government will derive as time goes on owing to Bunder Abbas becoming a telegraph station and thus an increased centre of trade, will not he helped by a second station on Heniam, which can never be more productive _ than it is at present. To establish such a second station would be almost like paying an expensive staff to intercept all telegrams passing between Busbire and Tehran or lehran and Kesht at Kushk-i-Nasrat, Chappar Kkaneh, or at Kerej or Yengi Imam. I camnot theretore but think that your Excellency has not adequately explained to His Majesty the object and nature of my Government’s proposal, and that it has been suspected that it was not merely intended to secure rapidity of telegraphic^ communication, but either to acquire for political purposes a knowledge not otherwise obtainable, by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, of all messages which might pass to and from Bunder Abbas, or else to deprive the Persian Government for the benefit of the Indo- European Telegraph Department of a portion of the profits of the new line. But His Majesty in his wisdom and sagacity will see at once, if he will deign to look more closely into the question, that this supposed first object will not be made easier by having one station at Henjam, since all messages must eventually come into the Indo- European Telegraph Department’s office there, even if there is a second Persian office, whilst the other object will anyhow not be obtained, inasmuch as under the earlier Convention all the receipts from local traffic on the Indian lines within Persia itself are handed over to the Persian Government. The creation of the two offices side by side on Henjam can therefore produce no effect except to diminish the receipts of the Persian Government, delay telegraphic communications, and perhaps furnish occasions for disputes. If, however, notwithstanding all these inconveniences, the Persian Government still prefers a second station of its owm at Henjam, I am prepared, subject to reference to His Majesty’s Government, to strike out the clause proposed by them to which I understand that His Majesty takes exception, and to conclude the agreement without further delay and without waiting for the information necessary in order to alter the present estimates for the cost of the work to be done by our engineers. When I ascertain exactly what the additional cost of such a station with the necessary wells and water supply will be, the charges for the works might be added to the amount guaranteed by the Persian Treasury for the construction of the entire line. It might, for instance, be possible to reduce the expenses by uniting both offices in a single building, or else, as has been suggested by Mr. New, by a division between the Persian and English staffs at Henjam of the hours of the day during which each shall have the use of the line, and the final settlement of these details might he reserved for further discussion. You will remember that Bunder Abbas will communicate through Henjam, not merely with Persia, but also with Europe, India, and Muscat. (Signed) I have, &amp;c. ARTHUB H.

The Mushir agreed in principle, and said he thought it would be simpler that the Agreement should be concluded with himself rather than with the Mukhber-ed-Dowleh, a view r m which I concur, since its terms wall in any case be referred to him as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I’have the honour to append the text of a draft Agreement 'which I am sending him, should your Lordship, to whom I am telegraphing on the subject, express to me your approval of its provisions. I am inclined to think that when the time comes for the Persian Government to pay the bill they may find it inconvenient to do so, and that we may then easily come to an arrangement which will secure the practical control of the new line by the Indo- European Department on the basis of a division of receipts. I w 7 ould therefore be in favour of accepting their proposal to build it themselves with English assistance, rather than that by raising objections in the hope of obtaining a more satisfactory agreement on paper, we should give the Persian Government a fresh pretext for delaying the commencement of the work. 1 have, &amp;c.

Such an Agreement would run as follows : — a • i \ r I 1( : i I e ^ ian G°y era nient having decided, in pursuance of the provisions of Arucie I of the Convention of 1868, to connect the port of Bunder Abbas with the telegraphic system of the Persian Gulf, the British Government agrees to place at its isposal for this purpose the services of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. f -l- t' 1116 co , nnection sha11 be effected by means of a land line across the Island ot Kishm (or by a submarine cable) from Bunder Abbas to the Indo-European lelegraph Department s station at Hen jam “3. The arrangements for the construction, working, and maintenance of the line, as well as for the allocation of the profits received from it, shall be identical with those contained m previous Telegraphic Conventions between the two Governments, notably m the Convention of the 16th August, 1901.” If, on the other hand, the Persian Government prefers, once the line is completed to take complete possession of it, and assume the responsibility for its working and upkeep, then, instead of the foregoing, Article 3 might run as follows:— ‘3. The line and the offices required for its working shall be constructed bv officers to be provided for the purpose by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and shall, after repayment by the Persian Government of the outlay, as well as of any expenses for working, maintenance, or repairs which may have been incurred iy the Department between the completion of the line and its transfer to the Persian Ministry of L elegraphs, become the sole property of the Persian Government, but shall penning such repayment, be worked and managed by the Department. r 4 ' I ^ 1 ® a S reed tha f the Persian Government, upon entering into possession of thB [1864^—2] Pl0y ° n 7 Per? ' lan sub -i ects on 14 and in the telegraph office at2 Bunder Abbas, hut this provision shall not preclude the Persian Government from employing foreign subiectsin the service of the Indo-European Telegrap epar should it desire or have occasion to borrow, and the Department be willing to lend their services.” His Maiesty’s Government attaches importance to this last provision, in view of the attempts which have been made by the Russian Legation to induce the Persian Government to employ Russian telegraphists on the Central Persian and Seistan telegraph lines. , „ ... The above is only a rough draft, embodying the substance of communications received bv me from His Majesty’s Government, and it is possible that certain emendations might be desired by them in it, but before^ discussing details 1 should be glad to learn whether your Excellency would be authorized to conclude an .Agreement on these general lines, and if so, which of the alternative suggestions sketched by me would be most agreeable to the Persian Government. ^ With reference to the question of a land line or a submarine cable, if the line is to be taken over when constructed by the Persian Government, it would be necessary that it should be a land one across the Island of Kishm, as a submaiine line would require a telegraph ship to effect repairs in it, such as those employed by the British Government, and by British and other foreign Telegraph Companies, and the Persian Government could hardly be expected to incur the great expense, out of all proportion to the profits, of procuring and maintaining such a vessel, or of providing the staff of engineers necessary for mending cables under the sea. The cost of making and maintaining the land line across Kishm would be, moreover, a great deal less than that of a submarine cable. It is estimated by His Majesty’s Government that it will amount to about 75,000 rupees, or 30,000 tomans, while the submarine cable would cost 124,018 rupees. I append the estimates for the two alternative schemes. The annual charge for upkeep is estimated at 6,400 rupees, or about 2,500 tomans a-year. It is not easy to estimate the probable profits to Government, as these for the first few years are likely to be small; but there can be little doubt that the line will ultimately fully repay the cost of laying and maintaining it, owing to the great impetus which will be given by it to the trade of Bunder Abbas. It will be followed—to mention only one result in this direction—by the opening of a branch there of the Imperial Bank of Persia, which has hitherto been prevented by the non-existence of telegraphic communications. It will, moreover, strengthen the hold of the Persian Government upon the whole district of Bunder Abbas, by enabling orders from Tehran or Bushire to be delivered in a few hours to the local Government, and thus indirectly increase the security of traders against robberies or disorders. Nor can it be doubted that by increasing the value of land, as the Central Persian line has already done in Kerman, it will enable the State to draw from the district an increasing revenue, without this being felt by the population. I should add that the connection of Bunder Abbas with Hen jam will prove much cheaper than the line fore shadowed in the Convention of 1865 connecting Bunder Abbas overland with Task, which is estimated to cost 30,5001., or 150,000 tomans. I may mention officially in this connection to your Excellency (I have already done so verbally) that His Majesty’s Government is prepared to agree to the proposal that telegrams exchanged on the Central Persian line between the Persian Govern ment and its Consul-General in India should be charged at half rates only, but I am to make it clear to your Excellency that this concession will apply to the Central Persian line only, and cannot take effect till the similar arrangement with regard to British State telegrams comes into force on the final completion of that line. His Majesty’s Government hope that the friendly spirit which has induced them to meet the wishes of the Persian Government in this respect, and which leads them always to desire to co-operate with it in all questions relating to the telegraphic communica tions binding together the two Empires, will be reciprocated by the Ministers of His Majesty the Shah in the matter of the Bunder Abbas-Henjam extension, which forms the subject of the present communication.

I Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, ^he Under Secretary of State, India Office.'opy. ^oj 48. My Lord:- I have the honour to report in continuation of my despatch No.]30 of the 18th July, that the Mushir ed Dow]eh informed me about a fortnight ago that he had submitted my proposals for connecting Henjam by tele graph with Bandar Abbas to the Shah, who did not re gard them as at present desirable. I told His Excellency, and repeated it to-day to the Prime Minister, that I could not send such a re ply to Your Lordship or to the Government of India, and that It would only be common courtesy for the Persian \ Government to assign a reason for rejecting a proposal made by us in the interest of British Trade which would at the same time be advantageous to Persia. In the case of the Seistan connection I had been informed that a pledge given to Russia stood in the way. Was I to un derstand that a similar pledge prevented the Persian Government from sanctioning the further extension of the Indo-European Telegraph system in the Gulf, and The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;C., &amp;c , that 9that the rumours current some years ago of secret arrangements between Persia and Russia in respect of Bandar Abbas were not as devoid of foundation as T had personally believed them to be? It was only on some assumption of this kind that the reply of the Persian Government could be explained, as objections on principle to the telegraph which, might be intelli gible in the case of such a ruler as the Dalai Lama of Thibet, could not be seriously attributed to an enlightened monarch like the Shah, who was the sov ereign of a civilised state. T.ne Ain ed Dow!eh said that he was personally in favour of the extension, and had recommended it to His Majesty. He did not know why the Shah was against it, but he could assure me that there was no understanding with Russia on the subject such as that which had prevented compliance with our wishes in the matter of the Seistan connection. I observed that in the case of the Central Per sian Line the objections made by the Shah on the ground that such incidents as the Graves murder might recurrecur and occasion trouble to the Persian authorities, had been surmounted by the arguments of the Atabeg-i- Azam, It seemed to me that His Highness, who as a near relative of the Shah, must carry greater weight than the Atabeg with His Majesty, should be able to prevail on him more easily to reconsider his opposition to the present much less ambitious project. The Ain ed Dow!eh said that his system was dif ferent from his predecessor's. He never attempted to force his Master’s hand or press him to take a course which he saw he disliked. If however I would write a fresh note to the Persian Government pointing out that under the Convention of 1868 the British Government was entitled to extend the line from Jask to'a point short of Bandar Abbas, he would be in a position to bring the matter again before His Majesty. I am preparing a communication to this effect, and I do not despair of attaining, by dint of perseverance, the result desired by the Government of India. I have &amp;c ., (Signed) Arthur H.

My M the , h0I10Ur t0 re ° eiVe ^ 0Ur Lordshi P’ S St 8 h infant ^ respecting the telegraph extension to Bunder Abbas. ^ n , a 7i are th f t th f G ^er n ment of India contends that Article I of the Convention 868 enables us to extend the line connecting Gwadur and Jask to a point anywhere “S' “ ,d * h ”*' “ •* M “ ■** - This Article runs: “ In order to provide against any possible accidents to the Persia n Gulf cable it is agreed between the High Contracting Governments of England ersia that the British Government shall make arrangements with regard to the Ksaasttiffi? ” f * of “ e “ ph i “~“ «*— - * !»&gt;”* I feel little doubt that if, on the strength of this provision, we were to attempt to Mowin^grounds 6 mentl ° ned aboVe ’ the Persian Government would object on the }• That t^ 6 line contemplated by the Convention of 1868 is the Gwadur-Jask line laid down in !869 ; that the selection of Jask as the terminal point was considered at that date to have carried out the objects of the Convention ; and that if now, over thirty years later a new terminal point is to be established, the choice of that point must form tne subject oi further agreement between the parties interested. 2. That since the conclusion of the Convention of 1868 the object of that Conven- twn which must be kept m view in interpreting it—be., the provision against accidents o the Gulf cable has been attained in another way, namely, the construction of a land ime right across Persia from Kashan vi&amp; Kerman to Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siah. It appears to ine that there is a good deal of force in these considerations, and although I have hinted m conversation with the Ain-ed-Dowleh at a right given to us under the Convention of 1868, I still think it best to work for the present for the line +k 0m r m y ar g ur nents °n the commercial needs of Bunder Abbas and of the Indian and other local traders. The Persian Government has not yet answered my Hst note on the subject, a copy of which I had the honour to inclose in my despatch I+ £ 0 &lt; 1 • Wo - . | 01 20th ultimo, and the nature of the answer, when it comes, must, I venture ? ' to think, determine our subsequent course of action. It will, I fear, be a little difficult for me to object formally to Persian control over the telegraph office, for which we are asking at Bunder Abbas, on the ground of its inefficiency, and I think we shall have to find some other way of bringing it under the effective management of our own officers. M. Naus tells me that the Bussian Consul-General at Bushire made an offer to M. Dambrain, the local Director of Posts and Customs, to run a postal service from Hen jam to Bunder Abbas at half the lowest rates obtainable in Persia, and, therefore, presumably by means of lunds provided by the Bussian Government. I asked his Excellency what reply M.^Dambrain had made to this offer. M. Naus said he had instructed him to treat it as a joke (“ une plaisanterie ”) and decline to discuss it seriously. I observe in the Confidential Print (Mr. Spring-Bice’s No. 201) that the Bussians are complaining that Persia has repudiated her pledge to them to complete or allow them to complete the telegraph line from Meshed to the Trans-Caspian frontier on the ground that no funds are available. I am making inquiries on this subject from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, I think it extremely likely that this attitude is due to our representations about other lines, and especially the Seistan one, and that the Persian Government hope, by playing our demands off against one another, to escape, or locioi -to dofei cts lung aa_possible, Hat? «^s.tabli«Liiient nf* ttny freed tclcgrapliic communi- cations whatever. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ABTHUB H. HABDINGE. ftIn his telegram Sir A.Hardinge states that he believes the Shah could be got to accept the proposal for a telegraph connection between Henjam and Bunder Abbas if the latter station is placed under Persian control. How an office worked under Persian control would certainly be an inefficient office,and it is moso desirable,if an office is opened at Bunder Abbas that the sca.fl in it should be capable of dealing with inter national traffic in a thoroughly efficient way. It is estimated that the cost of laying a cable from Henjam to Bunder Abbas will be Rs.1,24,000,while a connection by cables and landline via. Kis.-m world cost some Rs .72,000. An office at Bunder Abbas could probably be rented,but to build one would cost some Rs.SoOO. These figures shew that the scheme involves con- sidei anle expense,and it appears advisable if the expense is to be incurred that an efficient service should be obtained for it. it seems to me it might be pointed out to the Persian Government that if the Indo-European Telegraph Department were permitted to open an office at Bunder Abbas it may confidently be expected that a considerable number of foreign telegrams would terminate and originate at that station,and from this traffic that the Persian Government 'would derive increased revenue. It could be promised that to encourage telegraph messages being sent betv/een towns in the interior of Persia and Bunder Abbas a very small charge would be made for the carriage of these messages over the cable between Bushire and Bunder Abbas,and the Persian Government would thus obtain an increase of revenue on their local traffic, - all this increase of revenue be inf obtained at no cost to Persia. It appears to me action on the lines I have mentioned mighti might he taken before the question of giving the Persians the control of the telegraph office at Bunder Abbas is put before that Government. I would mention that it might be useful to find out how the Shall accepted the reopening of the telegraph office at that he would be more inclined to sanction the opening of an office at Bunder Abbas on condition that the Henjam office was closed. An arrangement of this kind might possibly meet the wishes of the Government of India, and the British Minister at Teheran might be able to overcome the Shah’s objections to the opening of an office at Bunder Abbas by proposing it,and by also shewing the probable advantages to the Persian revenue of an office at Bunder Abbas. Por the present an express service has been provided by this Department for telegrams marked ’’Express' between Hen- jam and Bunder Abbas,the extra charge being Rs.5/- per message,and the average time of delivery being about 24 hours.

Your Excellency:- The Viceroy of India was memorialized dur ing his recent visit to the Persian Gulf hy the British Indian trading community at Bunder Ahbas on the sub ject of the inconvenience entailed to traders hy the absence of telegraphic communication between that port and Bushire, and was asked to come to some arrangement with the Persian Government for connecting these two ports by a telegraph line. The Government of India has been sensible for some time past, especially now that a British Consul resides at Bunder Abbas, of the desirability of the 1 \ ;\Jf| improvement asked for fcy our merchants in their ad dress, and it has accordingly Instructed me to enter into negotiations with the Persian Government with a view to an extension of the present submarine cable from Hen;)am to Bunder Abbas. The line might be taken either across the island of Kishm, or under the sea His Excellency off' off the coast of that island betv/een it and Larak, the distance in the first case being about 50 and in the latter about 60 English miles. In the meanwhile pending the conclusion of such an arrangement the Government of India have decided to land the cable and reopen the Indo European Tele graph station on the island of Henjam, which existed as your Excellency is aware, from 1869 to 1881 and was abandoned in the latter year. The Viceroy, though he was unable to land at Henjam himself, sent an of ficer to Inspect the site granted in 1868 to the Indo European Telegraph Department by His late Majes - ty Nasr-ed-Deen Shah, and the latter reported that the landing of the cable and erection of the telegraph building, the remains of which appear to be still in existence, could be effected with little difficulty and expense. As soon as this has been dene I will have the honour to invite the Persian Post Office, through your Excellency's kind intermediary, to consider the or ganization of a provisional postal service from Henjam to Bunder Abbas, which, the distance between these places being only 50 miles, shall enable telegrams to reachreach Bunder Abbas frcm other telegraph stations in Persia and elsewhere and vice versa in a few hours, and next that of continuing the cable from Henjam to Bunder Abbas. In this connection I may say that the construc tion of a telegraph line across Kishm would be a good deal less than that of a submarine cable all the way, the estimate for the former being 71,750 rupees, and that for the latter 124,016 rupees. The erection of the telegraph builaing at Bunder Abbas is estimated at the same as at Henjam, viz: 8,500 rupees. I should observe that our old telegraph building at Henjam was v/ooden and was valued at 14,000 rupees and the one which we propose to erect on its foundations will be in the Persian style. The upkeep of the Bunder Abbas station would cost about 6,500 rupees a year. I shall however be glad to furnish your Excel lency with full particulars and details respecting this and any other aspects of the question of the pro posed Bunder Abbas line which the Persian Governmentmay desire before coming to a decision respecting it at your convenience, though your Excellency may per haps prefer to defer entering upon their discussion until after the close of the Moharrem holidays.

The volume’s principal correspondents are: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Major Percy Zachariah Cox); the British Ambassador (or Chargé d’Affaires) at Tehran (Sir Arthur Henry Hardinge; Sir Evelyn Mountstuart Grant Duff); the Assistant Resident and British Consul at Bandar-e ʻAbbās (Lieutenant William Henry Irvine Shakespear).The volume’s papers include:proposals, set out by British officials, for a telegraph cable running between Henjam and Bunder Abbas, chiefly for the benefit of the Indian merchant community at the latter place;papers detailing negotiations between British and Persian officials through 1905 concerning the construction of the telegraph cable from Henjam to Bunder Abbas, and the construction and operation of a telegraph office at Bundar Abbas. Much of the discussion centres on the running and costs of the telegraph office at Bundar Abbas, in response to the Persian Government’s insistence that they run the office, and the British Government’s insistence that only Persians be employed in the office (in order to prevent the appointment of Russian telegraphists). A printed copy of the agreement for the construction of the telegraph line from Henjam to Bunder Abbas, dated 13 May 1905, is included in the volume (f 149);copies of telegrams and other papers dated 1906, documenting the construction of telegraph facilities at Bunder Abbas, including British intentions to run the cable via their consular buildings, Persian objection to the proposals, and the protracted dispute over the location of the telegraph office that ensued;correspondence dated 1909, including a letter from Sir George Head Barclay at the British Embassy in Tehran, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey, dated 8 March 1909, confirming that the dispute between the British and Persian authorities over the location of a telegraph office at Bunder Abbas has been resolved (ff 20-21).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Bandar Abbas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bunder Abbas </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Telegraphy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Surveys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indo-European Telegraph Line</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x00037c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
