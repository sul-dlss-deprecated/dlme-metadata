I realize your difficulties and the extent of your efforts and am correspond ingly grateful. I do regret though not being able to find out exactly the content of those missing articles in the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. At the time I was told only viva voce what they were,and do not remember them sufficiently accurately to build any statement upon them. They were however not creditable to H # F.ft,,l think,and were very illustrative of the tortuous workings of P.Z’s mind. If you were here now and could see how they are trying to dig out the Ashar freek you would get a fine illustration of how Iraq will run when they enter the League.lt is a mess.Frs.Fylrea will tell you something about it. Tar and away the most interesting episode of the last few months is the way a dozen of the King’s entourage were tipped into the river,among them the redoubtable Lardine,from a raft. This demonstrated Iraq’s need of a Finieter of the Davy. °ur Futasarrif is being moved to Baquba. Other news there is .one.

PERSONAL &amp; CONFIDENTIAL. Dear De Saury, In reply to your D.0.MC-270 of the 20th November, I have now received the completed list of subscriptions which amounts to Rs.61/8- including Colonel Dickson and Mr. Patrick. I T m afraid the inclusion of the latter rather upsets the proposed wording for the inscription and as you probably do not want to put M the British and American Colony in Kuwait” perhaps ” With Best Wishes from the British Colony and K.O.C. Staff in Kuwait 1937” would do. Ofcourse, unfortunately, the inscription will cost considerably more that way. As regards your idea of a silver ink stand, I think this is excellent. It might possibly be a good scheme to include with it a sheet giving the donors names. The members of our staff who subscribed are:- L.D.Scott, T.E.Patrick, Col. H.R.P.Dickson, D.A.Campbell, P.W.Walker, N.J.Allison, A.S.Barnard, D.Robinson, C.H.Cady, J.Falconer, J.Manson,‘ R.E.Johnson, A.R.G.Harvey and F.T.Shields. I am forwarding the sum subscribed herewith. Captain G.S.De Gaury, M.C. KUWAITOffice Note of 6th September. 1938. His Highness informed me that a large number of the local people (about three hundred leading residents) have prepared a petition asking for the removal from the American Hospital of Dr.Mylrea, a British subject. They have already presented the petition to him, but I asked H-is Highness not to forward the petition to me (at least for the present) to which he agreed. 2 , In about 1934^1 believe^His Highness wrote to the Headquartess of the Mission in U.S.A. complaining about Dr.Mylrea, over some minor matter i.e. in connection with his abrupt reply to him over a request about electric fitting work to be done for the Viceroy’s visit by a man at that moment in Mylrea’s daily employ. Earlier in 1938, when Dr.Thoms left, there was a petition made to him, so Thoms told me, asking for him to stay here instead Dr.Mylrea. 4 # The complaints given in the petition against Mylrea I gathered from the Sheikh are mainly:- (a) a bitter and domineering manner (b) Age [is) Bad eyesight 5 # I should like to avoid the matter coming to a head and shall speak to Dr*Harrison, whom the Sheikh today greatly praised to me. Points I think to remember are (nowadays) (a) Possibility of a definite propaganda compaign in Arab Newspapers (There has already been a certain amount) and thus commencement* of (b) Zanonhobia. outwrdly non existant hitierto here, and a pity to allow it to become expressed and so prejudice good work of thirty years by Mission with possibly evil effect upon other American and British residents.Political Agfincy, Kuwait* I714i September 193Q* Denar Dr. Harrison, This is to confirm our conversation on the 15th September in *hich I told you that His Highness the Ruler informed me that he bad received a petition signed by a number of Kuwaitis appealing agpinst the return here as Mission Doctor of Dr. Myirea. X told you the reasons which were Given. His Highness touched upon the occasion some years ago when he himself had written to the Mission about Dr. Myirea, and the petition to the Mission son® few non the ugo, usld.ng Dr. Thorns etcy here instead of Dr. Myirea. 3. I told you also tha t the Ruler said that he proposed to send to me the present petition, as Dr. Myirea was a British subject, but I asked him not to do so, and said that I felt suns that we could safely leave the natter with you, about whom, and the Mission in general. His Highness spoke at sene length in great prais e. You: s si nc er e ly Dr. P. w. Harrison, The Americaa Mission, Kuwait-AMERICAN MISSION P. W. Harrison, m.d. MUSCAT, ARABIA. Dear Captain BeGaury:— I am a^rfully sorry that I vyas not in when you and Dr* Greenway called. I appreciate your calling very much indeec. I h^ve run across nothing new in regard to Dr. MyIrea, All the reactions that have gotten to me^would indicate that the opposition to him has died down, at least for the present, ‘•no. that ne will fino. friendly reception when he arrives, and that h ter development 'ill depend on how he h' ndles the situation, particularly os he begins work. May I add my sincere up reciation of your own attitude nd friend liness in all this. ”-'e owe the outcome to you, ‘ s we very ’ell understand, and we shall all be hoping for an equally fortunate development of the matter, in the Future.
