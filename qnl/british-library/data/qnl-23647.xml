With regard to ' lent ' officers, the Government of India have decided to establish the convention (mentioned in paragraph 4. of the Home Depart ment letter No. F.-9/11/30-Ests., dated the 25th January 1933,) that in the case of a difference of opinion between the lending and the borrowing authority as to the imposition of a particular penalty, the opinion of the lending authority shall ordinarily prevail. In such a case the borrowing authority would probably prefer to revert the officer concerned to the lending authority. (I am to express the hope that the local Government will also establish a similar convention in respect of officers lent to them). [I am to request that the convention mav be observed in future in regard Coorg to officers lent to the Delhi Administration.] A. and N, Islands ( ) To local Governments only. [ ] To Chief Commissioners.2 (3 With reference to the remarks made in your letter, I am to say that so far as the Governnient of India are aware, the penalty of 'suspension' is imposed pending the institution and result of an enquiry. As m such cases previous consultation with the lending authority is likely to involve delay which it is desirable to avoid, the Government of India have decided not to make any provision for it. They consider that a report to the lending authority of the ciicumstances leading to the imposition of this penalty, as provided for in the notification, will suffice. ) f 3 With reference to the remarks made in paragraph 2 of your letter, I am to invite the attention of the local Government to the letter from the Department of Education, Health and Lands, No. F.-18/5/33-H., dated the 12th September 1933, a copy of which was forwarded with an endorse ment of the same number and date.] I have the honour to be, S ib, Your most obedient gervant^ C&gt; Mi TRIVEDI, Deputy Secretary to the Qovernment of India, No. F.-9/2/33-E sts.

In supersession of the orders contained in the Home Department Resolution No. D-6409-Ests., dated the 20th Novem ber 1922, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India has decided that a civil officer of Government who was granted civil volunteer terms while serving in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers during the Great War and who, after having been invalided from military service, was able to return to his civil employment, will be allowed the option of :— (i) being treated, as regards mili tary pension, as a temporary officer, in which case his mili tary service will count for civil pension under civil rules; or (ii) being treated, as regards military pension, as an officer of the regular army, in which case his military service will not so count. 2. A civil officer serving under the terms referred to in the previous para graph who is invalided both from mili tary service and from his civil appoint ment, on account of a disability incurred as a result of his military service, will be allowed to draw the military pension admissible to a regular military officer and also to count the period of his mili tary service for civil pension. This deci sion has effect from the 3rd February 1925, and any consequential adjustments should be made from that date only. 3. In the case of a member of the Indian Civil Service who elects to be treated for purposes of military pension as an officer of the regular army and where military service will not therefore count for civil pension, the 4 per cent, annuity contributions paid by him during the period of his military service shall be refunded to him. 4.

Sfi- By order, retary to the Politijoa jidentof State for India, A0.9/Fo-17/7/27-Ists., ^ D&amp;te^i the 26th January 1928, Bffeot of stop p age of Incr ements on overseas pay I am direoted to addrese you on the question whether an offiner of non-Auiatic domioile belonging to one of the Bervioee specified in Schedule I to the Superior OiviX Seriioee (Hevision of Pay.Paseagfi and Pension) Rules, 1924, whose inorements have been stopped at the 4th year of his service should be allowed in his &amp;th and subsequent years to draw overReao pay In sterling at £ 15, or whether bin overiveae pay should be restrloted to Es. 150 the rate oorrespending to the basic pay that he actually draws. The specifio question arose out of a referenoe from the Accountant General,Burma, a oopy of whose oommunication on the suhjeot is enclosed. A similar question would arise in the case of an officer whose increments were stopped at one of the years after which overseas pay increases A from £ 15 to/85 or from £ 25 to £ 5C . The interpretation which the Oovernrnent of India place on the rule as it standti is that the change of overseas pay from Hs. 150 to £ 15 in the fifth year of an officer's eervice is an in crement granted to him, a«d that, if his inorement has been stopped, eifent is not given to that order merely by stopping the inorement in his rupee pay without stopping it in his overseas pay. The Auditor General, however,talce e p the view that the change from rupee to sterling overseas pay must under the Rules take place after a fixed period and is not dependent Upon approved service and the consequential grant of increment in the rupee basic rate of pay. Further, he holds that a® the power of interpreting these statutorv rules has not been bestowed on the Government of India the question should be referred for the Secretary of State's orders. I am accordingly to ask that fee point may be submitted to the Secretary of State for his orders and his decision communicated to the Government of India. ♦ n No. 5 , -17/7/27-Ests.

S ubject.— Payment of travelling allowances to witnesses summoned by an officer whose conduct is under enquiry. S ir, I am directed to say that the question whether the witnesses summoned on behalf of an officer whose conduct is the subject of a departmental enquiry should be paid their travelling allowances by the Government, has been under the considera tion of the Government of India and, that after consultation with the local Govern ments, it has now been decided that the following principles should be observed :— (i) travelling allowances may be paid to the witnesses summoned, in the event of the officer concerned clearing himself ; (ii) such allowances will be paid only in respect of witnesses whose evidence is considered to be of material value by the officer conducting the en quiry; (in) in exceptional cases the officer conducting the enquiry may, on grounds to be recorded, recommend to the Government of India that the principles laid down above be departed from owing to special reasons. 2. It should be noted that so far as Government servants are concerned, Supplementary Rule 154 allows them to draw travelling allowance as for a journey on tour, when they appear as witnesses in a departmental enquiry, and, that under Supplementary Rule 190, a competent authority may grant similar travelling allowance to witnesses who are not Government servants. The circum stances in which a competent authority would be justified either in granting or in refusing the grant of travelling allowance under Supplementary Rule 190 have not so far been defined, and the intention of the orders contained in paragraph 1 is to lay down certain definite principles for your guidance in disposing of claims for travel ling allowances by witnesses who are not Government servants. It is not intended by these orders that the claims of witnesses who are Government servants should be dealt with otherwise than under Supplementary Rule 154. 3. With regard to condition (Hi) in .paragraph 1 above, I am to explain that where the officer conducting an enquiry recommends ttuit a particular case merits exceptional treatment, it will be for the Government of India to decide, after taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case whether the recommendatioa should be accepted or not.f I Hi- Hv 4. I am to add that the principles laid down in paragraph 1 apply only to departmental enquiries held by officers serving directly under the Government of India. I have the honour to be, ■ Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) K. R. MENON, Under Secretary to the Government of India. No. F. 422/27- Public.

If in any case a proposal is made that a Government servant should be lent to a pri vate undertaking, it is necessary that the principles of this rule should be applied most rigorously, and I am to say that in general the loan of a Government officer to a private undertaking should be regarded as a very exceptional case requiring special justification.

This modifi cation will greatly affect the precedence at official functions of Senior Members of tke Indian Civil Service and the political department, a Collector* Deputy Commissioner or District and Sessions Judge of 23 years service will now rank in article 36 whether within or outside his district and not in articles 41 and 55 respectively.

S ubject. — Application of Rule 1A of the Superior Civil Services Rules. S ir, I am directed to address on the question of the application of Rule 1A of the Superior Civil Services Rules, promulgated with the Home Department notification no. F- 16/10/28-Ests., dated the 9th January 1930, to posts specified in Schedules III, VIII and IX to those Rules. 2 Rule 8(1) read with Rule 1A of the Superior Civil Services Rules operates to deprive officers officiating in posts specified in Schedule III to these Rules, from drawing the sterling overseas pay which is admissible to substantive holders of the Dosts When Rule lA was introduced, however, it was not intended that such a result should follow. I am, therefore, to state that the Governor General m Council has, under the powers vested in him by the proviso to Rule 1 A, been pleased to direct that an officer while officiating m a post specified in Schedule III to the Superior Civil Services Rules, shall be entitled to draw the sterling overseas pay prescribed in Rule 8 (1) of those Rules, if he was entitled to sterling overseas pay in his previous time-scale post. 3. Similarly, the effect of Rule 18 read with Rule lA of the Superior Civil Services Rules, is to deprive officers officiating m posts specified m Schedule Vili from drawing the basic and special pay prescribed m that Schedule. As this was not intended, the Governor General in Council is pleased to direct that the word ' holding ' in Rule 18 refers to both officiating and substantive appointments. 4 For similar reasons, the Governor General in Council is pleased to direct that officers holding any of the posts specified in Schedule IX shall draw the pay including sterling or rupee overseas pay and special pay (if any), prescribed m that Schedule whether the posts are held by them substantively ^or m an officiating capacity. 5. These orders will have effect from the date on which Rule lA came into force. I have the honour to be, S ir, Your most obedient Servant, (Sd.)

ROY, E sq ., I .C.8., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. To A ll LOCAL GOVEENMENTS. Niw Delhi, the 28th November 1931. Subject :— Decision that in all future cases in which an officer of an All-India Service applies for permission to resign after his conduct has been the subject of investigation, a reference should be made to the Secretary of State in Council before the resignation is accepted. Sir, The Secretary of State has recently drawn attention to the fact that, strictly speaking, power to permit a member of an All-India Service to resign the service rests with the Secretary of State in Council alone, as no formal delegation of that power to any lower authority has been made. While the Secretary of State realises that the grant of permission to resign may, in ordinary cases, be regarded as a formality, he considers that in cases in which the officer's conduct has been under investigation, it is important that a reference should be made to him before the resignation is accepted in order that he may discharge the responsibility which rests on him, on the one hand, of safeguarding the interests of officers appointed by him and, on the other, of satisfying himself that the circumstances are such as to justify the office^ being permitted to resign as an alternative to being dismissed' or removed from the service. He has therefore directed that in all future cases in which an officer of an All-India Service applies for permission to resign after his conduct has been the subject of investigation, a reference should be made to the Secretary of State in Council before the officer's resignation is accepted. I am directed to request that these instructions may be carefully observed in all cases of the nature in question that may occur in future. I have the honour to be.

The Government of India presume that in the case df an application submitted ^y an Officer on leave in England to the secretary of State direct, the latter would normally consult the Government of India who would in turn ascertain the views of the local Government. As stated in paragraph 4 of the Home Department letter NO.F.48/2/32-Pu'blic, dated the 26th May 1932 (enclosure No.3) cases in which such prior consultation is not made must be very rare, but as it is possible that such cases majr have ocoured, the Government cf India would 'be glad to know whet^r/ they can assume that the prin ciple has been accepted that the views cf the local Government concerned snouid be ascertained except in the circumstances In which a reference to them would be likely to result in delay and consequent loss of the em ployment in view.

Offlcnrs on leave pending retirement are however regarded by the Secretary of State in Ocunoll as standing on a different footing in this respect from those who are uitwudiug tc return tc duty in India and, as was indicated in : m r. Dixon's letter, s.A G.3696/30, dated 25th August, 1930, to the Secretary to the Railway Board applleatlens for permission tc take up private employment while/while cn leave pending retirement have hitherto 'been dis posed of, without reference to Oovernments in India, in accordance with the principles laid down in the working rules of which a copy was forwarded to the Governraent of India with Mr-IXirabell •s demi Official letter 3. &amp; Gr.1087/ /28, dated 29th March 1928. The acceptance of employment o£ an unobj e^ticna a&amp;le character in this c ountry hy an officer who has no intention of returning to duty In India would not irima facie appear to 'be a matter affecting administration in India, and the Secretary of State in Council would, therefore, prefer not to depart from past practice regard ing the disposal of applications from officers who are on leave pending retirement.&gt;/5 HOME DEPARTMENT.

With further reference to your letter of the 7th June, No. M.-3235 /32, and my reply of the 9th June, Tmo./108/Evd./Kb., it has been brought to my notice that a Government official who wished to travel home by air, under the Lee Concession Scheme, was informed by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, that this facility was not available. The official in question pro posed to travel on the aircraft leaving Karachi on the 11th May. I appreciate that the matter has been under consideration for some time and that only recently was a definite ruling arrived at. In order, however, that any misunderstanding may be avoided as regards a similar occurrence in the future, I should be extremely grateful if you would kindly bring this facility to the notice of the Accountant General, Central Revenues in India.

In reply to your letter of the 24th June, No. Tmo./lSl/Evd./Kb., I am directed to inform you that the Civil Passage Rules of the Government of India do not at present contain any provision for the grant of concession passages by air, and although the question of amending the rules to permit of such passages is under consideration, no orders on the subject have yet been issued. The position at the moment therefore is-that any relaxation of the rules in respect oi such passages requires the sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council. While, therefore, the intimation made by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, thait the facility of taking a concession passage by sir is not yet available under the regulations is correct, I may state that, pending a revision of the rules, applications made by officers for a relaxation of the rules to permit of passage by air are invariably granted by the Secretary of State in Council.

I have the honour to rfefer to your letter of the 13th July, reference S. &amp; G.-3703/32, concerning Civil Passage Rules of the Government of India.I have received a communication from an officer of the Indian Army who is desirous of travelling to England by air in February 1933. In reply to his enquiry as to what part of the cost of his passage by air wo aid be met by the Lee Concession Scheme, he recei v^ed a letter from the Auditor General in India (of wbich I attach a copy) to the effect that passages by air are not covered by the Lee Concession Scheme. In view of the second paragraph of your letter quoted above, which states that 44 applications made by officers for a relaxation of the rules to permit of passage by air are invariably granted by the Secretary of State in Council I am wondering if it would be possible for you to pass this in formation to the Auditor General in India, so that Government officials, etc., wishing to travel by air might be informed that the rules will be relaxed on application to the Secretary of State, pending revision of the rules to include passages by air. L etter from the A uditor G eneral in I ndia , N ew D elhi, to the C omp troller , N orth- W est F rontier P rovince, dated the 14 th O ctober 32. S ubject ;— Admissibility of the cost of passages from the personal passage accounts for journey by air. With reference to your letter No. 805-A., dated the 12th October 1932, on the subject noted above, I have the honour to state that under Regula tion 8 of the Passage Regulations laid down in Schedule IV of the Superior Civil Service Rules, 1924, and subject to the conditions mentioned therein, an officer is entitled to receive passages by sea and not by air between a port in India and a port outside Asia. In the present case, the cost of journey by air from Karachi to London and back cannot therefore be met from the passage account of Captain K. C. Packman, I.A. In view of the above, the question raised in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply does not arise.
