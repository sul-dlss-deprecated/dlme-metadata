You should consider in conjunction with —^ Military Adviser whether it is necessary to take any action within your juris- diction on the lines indicated. My view is that whereas there is no objection to drawing up plans for use in case of emergency, the risk of attack by parachute troops is at present so slight that nothing should be done which would be likely to (cause panic amongst the local inhabitants, or to suggest in any way that such attack was imminent.

V 0 Passive Air Defence and Defence against parachutists• The General Staff have pointed out that there are some stations on the North West Frontier of India which possess a certain degree of importance and vulnerability to attack from tiie air, but which have no regular garrison e.g. Parachinar, Miranshah, Arawali etc. etc.. Passive measures of protection against possible air attack for such places are necessary and the responsibility for the preparation of a Passive Air Defence Scheme to meet local requirements, lies with the civil author ities. In considering the places for which schemes should be framed, you will no doubt consult the local military authorities so as to ensure that there is no overlapping or conversely that no places are overlooked. Attention is specially invited to the necessity for considering the danger of landings by para chute troops in tribal areas. 2. Passive Air Defence measures consist of - (a) Black out. (b) Improvised protection of Headquarters and personnel against blast and splinters, e.g., sandbags and slit trenches. 3. As stated above defence against parachutists also now has to be considered, though this is technically an active as opposed to a passive measure, and copies of two notes on di the subject recorded by the General Staff are enclosed for guidance. 4. It is requested that the purport of the preceding paragraphs /paragraphs may kindly be brought to the notice of all civil authorities with whom the Local Administration is concerned, including the North West Frontier State3 » the attention of the Baluchistan States Commandants of Frontier Corps being particularly invited to their responsibilities (e.g* at Parachinar, Miranshah and Arawali) • b. In so far as the North West Frontier States are Baluchistan States concerned, this communication is issued under the authority of the Crown Representative* The issue of the above has been authorised. Sd. 3.W. FLSTCHiilR Additional Deputy Secretary to the Government of India*/ 1 - © MOST SECRET. (x Copy of a note dated the 1st June 194C recorded by the General Staff. # • • • x X X X 1. Attacks by parachutists and air borne troops on aerodromes etc. have usually been made betvjeen three hours before and three after sunrise but may be expected at any time. Attacks have sometimes been preceded by bombing and machine gun attacks to neutralise local defences. Parachute troops often attempt to overpov/er the defenders and to isolate the aerodrome by cutting communications, and by attacking control rooms and headquarters. They may also attempt to destroy aircraft. Troops have also been landed from gliders which carry ten to twenty men. Any obstruc tions on the aerodrome have then been cleared to enable troops carriers to land. Twleve parachutists can jump from some type of aircraft in six to ten seconds from a height of three hundred parachutists appear to surrender, though they have a grenade in each hand. Uniform,when worn, has been a green combination suit with a badge consisting of a v/reath encircling a diving eagle. On other occasions parachutists have been disguised as British soldiers, clergymen, nuns or ordinary civilians. 2. Most of the equipment of parachutists is in containers dropped separately also by parachute, it may consist of mortars, automatic weapons, grenades, flame throwers, auto-cycles, bicycles and even motor cycle side-cars fitted with machine guns. Parachutists and troop carrying aircraft have often been protected by fighter aircraft which remained overhead during the whole action. Prom one type of aircraft parachutists have been deplaned at the rate of one thousand troops her hour. Each of these air craft carried twelve to twentyfive men according to the arms and equipment carried • Air.transported troops may land on any available space other than an aerodrome having no regard to whether the aircraft crashes or not. The latter are fitted with machine guns for air defence and with others for use on the ground. Usually the plan and orders have been known only to officers. If the officer has been shot the remainder have some times surrendered. Alternatively they have easily been rendered ineffective . 3. We are warned to beware of possible use of non-persistent gas before and during an attack. This may be delivered by bomb, spray or grenades. Parachutists require time after landing to unpack their equipment and rally etc., and for several minutes they are relatively defenceless, and are relatively easily dealt with. It is therefore imperative to avoid being surprised by attack by troops from the air and to counter-attack immediately before they have had time to become formidable. If the advanced party of parachutists has been neutralised transport aircraft may land expecting little resistance and the enemy troops can be overwhelmed as they deplane. It is important to impress on all that the sequence of action must be, - feet. This has often been carried out unobserved. Sometimes (a) to avoid surprise (b) to take prompt action against parachute troops (c) to prepare defensive plans against transport aircraft SECRET. Copy of a note dated the 26th June 1940 recorded k by the General Staff.!• Ene^y objective in Prontier States and in non-administered areas under the control of His Excellency the Governor of the North West Frontier province and the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan might be, - ^aj Landing grounds. (b) Important bridges,with a view either to their destruction or capture for use in a subsequent advance. (c) Posts and Telegraph offices. 2. Parachutists require time after landing to unpack their equipment, rally,etc., and for several minutes they are relatively defenceless and relatively easily dealt with. It is therefore imperative to avoid being surprised by this form of attack and to be prepared to take immediate action to attack the enemy before he has time to become formidable. If the advanced party of parachutis ts has been neutralised, transport aircraft may land expecting little resistance and the enemy troops can be overwhelmed as they deplane. It is important therefore to impress on all that the sequence of action must be, - (a) To avoid surprise. ^b) To take prompt action against parachute troops. (c) To prepare defensive plans against transport aircraft• 3. In the areas under consideration it is suggested that any organisation created to counter this threat should be based on the following principles:- ^a) The organisation must provide for continuous observation at all points where parachutists might land,e.g.landing grounds and other open spaces, and there must be an efficient system for giving warning. (b) Armed personnel must be held in readiness at all such points to attack parachutists as soon as they appear. (c) Permanent guards should be placed on all important bridges, telegraph offices, etc. or be able to reach such points within 10 minutes. (d) Consideration should be given to placing obstruc tions on landing grounds, ho obstructions should however be placed without prior consultation with the Director of Civil Aviation or the General Staff. (e) If means are available, consideration should also be given to the construction of concrete or stone pill boxes or guard towers at landing grounds. 4.
