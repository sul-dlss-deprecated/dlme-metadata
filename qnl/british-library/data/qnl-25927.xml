Repeated to Government of India Ko. 307 £. f-o. MOSCOW, Political Resident Persian Gulf JJJJJJJ Government of India telegrams ilos.200 and 203, not repeated to Moscow. The Government of India propose tliat His Majesty* s Government should exert pressure on Iran (Persia) in cooperation with Russia to secure the expulsion of all Germans, pressure to he economic in the first instance and.to include the control of imports of war material and non-participation oy British premier firms in the improvement of communications. 2. The effect this policy miyht have on the activities of United Kingdom Commercial Corporation need not he considered, since the Corporation buys not for our use, hut to deprive the Germans of supplies, and at present German trade is at a standstill, because even Turkish route is impracticable until goods can be sent through Istanbul (Constantinople) or the Germans secure com.and of the Black Sea. 3. There are, however, two objections (a) policy of the Government of India cuts across the proposals from His majesty's Ambassador to Moscow for increased transit trade with Russia via Iran, (b) the removal of all Germans would surely be an un-neutral act. 4. Although tim.nsit trade cannot attain the dimensions envisaged by His Majesty's Ambassador to Moscow, something can be done with railway and Zahidan routes but not if, at the sum time, we are making extreme demands upon the L^ard/jiGovernment. Mithout the goodwill of the Iranian Government transit could be reduced to insignificance. 3. I must admit that general warnings about the Germans are not likely to be effective. The Germans appeared to be about to leave doubtless because of newspaper and other reports that the British were going to send troops into Iran. You now tell me to assure the Iranian Government that these reports are unfounded and are due to Axis malevolence. I had already informed the RECd. POL. DEPt* 16JUU941 INDIA OFFICE Prime/... iPrime Minister July 10th that they v/ere untrue and wore ^ contradicted by our policy, proved many times in this war, of . i‘respect for the neutrality of other states. Jould a demand %&gt; for the• departure of all 0 enaans be compatible with that policy? I think not. The beiiaviour of the Germans in Holland etc. is admitted by the Prime Minister but we can produce surprisingly little proof of fifth column activities here although w ' e *are^sure^jjhey must be going on. ,T*-re;tum therefore to the proposals which must seem trivial in comparison with the comprehensive scheme of the Government of India. Please see my telegrams Nos. UO, U1 and M19*_ If letter which I propose to write could arouse suspicions of the Shah that the Germans are working against him and his regime it would^ do as much good as threats. In addition we might 'apply the legitimate sanctions of refusing all facilities for goods at Assab (Prime Minister asked yesterday for decision as the Iranian Government had a [ grp. undec.] offices at‘ Port Said at their disposal) and for coaches in Iraq until enemy ships at Banda Shapur are immobilized, and Mayer leaves Iran. If this proved to be unsuccessful other forms of pressure might be tried to secure these specific objects. Meanwhile, I will collect a list of Germans, against whom prima facie case could be made, without our sources being implicated and will continue to press for a general reduction in the number of Germans in the interests of the Iranian Government for while many are doing essential work for the Iranian Government, many are not.4 , rT1 . „ INDIA DIRECT [1 his Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept [Cypher] under Lock and Key.] GENERAL DISTRIBUTION From: IRAN (PERSIA ) FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE /EXT 4050 . ^-1 , Sir R« Bullard No, 419« B. 6.30, p # m. 9th July, 1941.

The article is obviously intended as reply to your representations to Iranian (Persian) Minister and to such accusations as that of Daily Mail referred to in my , telegram No. 413. It is disingenuous. Except for about 6 men in aircraft work, all British (of whom majority are Indian) are in Anglo-Iranian Oil Comoany whose work is essential to His Majesty’s Government, v/hereas Germans are scattered about in key positions in railways, arsenal, wireless stations etc., where fifth column which Germans have perfected might be particularly dangerous. The Shah may be afraid to take strict measures against the Germans lest the German Government should begin to attack him openly and anneal to the Iranian people against him. This presupposes that he knows how intensely unnonular he is. vanity, however, and the fear that he insnires in his Ministers generally prevented his learning this. 2. I propose writing secret letter to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and to give a copy to the Prime Minister and I should like to be able to say that I am writing with your approval. I would state thal for months nast Germans throughout Iran have been preaching to the effect that all the grievous economic ills from which they, like many other countries, are suffering are due to imperialist policy, and that this is the fault of the British who they stupidly allege assisted His Majesty to ascend the throne, wished to maintain him by money paid through Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and by other means. 3. It is possible that the Shah knows of these accusations and is refusing to take action against the Germans for fear of lending colour to the (? accusation] that he is under British influence, but I think that the [? balance of] advantage is in favour of my writing as proposed in paragraph S and bring up the contrast made in paragraph 1 namely that our interests deoend on the stability of Iran whereas Germany’s policy throughout the war has been to bring about the disintegration of smaller states as preliminary to domination.2. 4. If letter is to t&gt;e sent I nropose to inform Soviet Ambassador of the general [gro.om; ? purport! of my renresentations and to suggest that he should speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the German danger from his own point of view, • He-has already discussed the subject with me. The fact.that we are on the same side as Soviet Union does us harm with conscientious Iranians and with the Shah. Moreover our interests are not identical ^nce the maintenance of the integrity of Iran is not necessarily a Soviet interest. Nevertheless we must work together as far as possible and it is probable that no British representations about the Germans will have much effect unless supported by the Russians. 5 . I shall be glad to have your instructions. [Telegram as received was very corrupt}.Wr.

We should therefore in my opinion encourage Soviet Union to back up the proposed joint diplomatic demarche by troop concentrations on North Iranian frontier: and as, in view of Soviet difficulties on the , western front, such concentrations may not in themselves carry sufficient conviction, it is for consideration whether we should not simultaneously stage some form of military w threat either on the Baluchistan frontier or in the Persian Gulf. The time factor is so important that we cannot afford to allow the Iranians to procrastinate as they doubtless will unless sufficiently frightened. 2. Ostentatiotts and frequent consultations between His Majesty's Minister and Soviet Ambassador, Tehran, would also help but would probably not be sufficient in themselves.a^.OVl Jo'Vb-nyJAx.'Z; ff i &amp; 3 rsn ov -Q 'VH 0 ' i&gt; [ihis ceLfegrain is of retainaa by the au 17 v r r» 1 &lt;11 JW 1 t94l paif^iculat seclrecy and should be ■horip^l^r^ceipp.ent and not passed on]. \ J [Cypher \\K,\ CABIiipT DIsAlBUTIOM From: SOVIET NNION FROE MOSCOr/ TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir S. / Cripps No. 7g4 .

Provided that you see no objection, you should take early opportunity to impress upon Iranian Government that rumours of British intentions m regard to Iran (Ftersia) are fabrications put about by the Axis Powers. The dissemination of reports of this kind is designed to afford an excuse for German action and is part of a technique which is now familiar. In Iran the obvious danger is from the powerful fifth column organisation which the Germans nave built up and the Iranian Government would be well advised to take every possible precaution and to make sure that the number of Germans in Iran is rapidly reduced. 3 9^° I ^ ll/'J ' • eeeee RECd.

(l)) Food shortage in country is acute and starvation in the villages is rife. This will lead to great difficulties should we ever decide go take over an area such as the oil fields where there are no reserve stocks and distribution is difficult. He suggest stocks be built up now in properties of ,;nglo Iranian Oil Company. (E) Serious disorders shortly are inevitable. 3, He was most emphatic in attributing this serious state of affairs to luck of energy and leadership of senior British Officials which in turn affects the efficiency of Junior Officials. He also stressed his opinion that there existed a lack of co-ordination between the difierent British Authorities in this area generally who he feels fail to realise the seriousness of the danger com renting them. Most foreigners especially from German occupied territories he says are sitting on the fence v/aiting m vain for a British lead. 4, How much truth there is in these opinions I am unable to judge but it is interesting to have the view of a foreigner who has been for some six years in c-ose touch with the Official and Commercial communities and is obviously a staunch supporter of the Allied cause. 0656Z/5# Advance Copy Duty Capt.D.O.B.(F),D*J.I.G, Hd. of M. part 6 and final not yet received.

UvllXC »LWAp ^'TtAOi The External Department may like to have the following comments on the. Government of India’s telegram No.3389 of Sthf^^pw* July regarding our policy towards Persia. ^ _A 2, I think that we have certain very valuable economic weapons with which we could bring to bear pressure upon Persia, in particular in regard to the following commodities:- (a) Sugar - Persia normally imports large quantities of sugar and is at present dependent for her supplies on Java, Russia and India. A contract for the supply of 30,000 tons of Java sugar has just been completed by the United Kingdom Commercial - Corporation, but the contract does not bind us to provide shipping. It must be borne in mind as regards sugar that if the Germans obtain control over Russia they could supply Iran with Russian sugar. (b) Tea - Iran is a very big consumer of tea, for supplies of which she is dependent on India, the Netherlands East Indies and Ceylon. She is trying to obtain through the U.K.C.C. large quantities of tea from India, but no big contract has yet been signed. (c) Wheat - The Iranian Government recently, very foolishly, turned down some wheat cargoes which had been diverted from Greece and which we offered them. They did this because their own harvest was becoming available and because they were expecting large supplies from Russia. It is however understood that their own harvest is not a good one, and it is presumably possible that the Russians will want all their wheat to keep their Army in the field. It is therefore very likely that in the Autumn Persia will De desperately in need of wheat. Here again, as in the case of sugar, if Germany obtain control of Russia she could probably keep Persia supplied with some Russian wheat. (d) Lorries and tyres - Internal transport in Persia is largely dependent on an adequate supply of lorries. We can cut these off in co-operation with the United States and we are already asking them to give shipping priority to India’s requirements of chassis^ which will probably have the effect of cutting off Persia’s supplies in any case. Even if Germany was able to keep Persia supplied with lorries in answer to an embargo by us we could withhold tyres and thus make the German lorries useless. Persia's ireports of tyres are at present being reduced to a minimum. (e) Persia has bought about 100,000 tons of steel rails for the Tehran-Tabriz Railway. These are of course not economically important to Persia, but if they werp cut off this would have considerable effect on the Shah’s ffiffffiyfrt attitude. (f) Cement - Persia is in the market for considerable quantities of cement, probably also in connection with the Tehran-Tabriz Railway. A contract for supplies from India has just been made by the U.K.C.C. If the Germans obtain control over Russia they might be able to keep Germany supplied with Russian cement. 3. The above are the commodities which we can either withhold from the Persians or allow them to have as we wish. The Persians also/also want large quantities of machinery, some of which.they have I think recently been obtaining from Germany, Germany will no doubt now have difficulty, for communications reasons, in sending any machinery to Persia until they have beaten Russia. We cannot however offer to supply instead. Persia also normally obtains large quantities of cotton piecegoods from Japan. In view of the withdrawal of the Japanese shipping from the Persian Gulf these will be cut off, but I am not certain that India will be able to supply unless the Government of India take measures to restrict the consumption of piecegoods in India itself and thus make more of their productive capacity available for export. 4. As regards Persia's imports we have7strangle4^hold as regards shipping. There is very little shipping in the Persian Gulf and what there is is under the control of ourselves or the United States. 5. I do not think that we can bring any pressure to bear in regard to Iran's exports. These are chiefly raw cotton, raw wool, oilseeds, gum, ravins and almonds. If ifce hold off the market the Germans would certainly continue to buy in the hope that after they have disposed of Russia they would be able to transport their purchases to Germany. 6. My conclusion therefore is that Persia has probably got to tighten her belt in any case, because owing to shipping difficulties she cannot obtain her full requirements from overseas. This forms a weakness in the policy of 'inducements’* which the Foreign Office have hitherto been dangling before the Shah, because we shall never be in a position to i^^et ^-ll Persia's requirements. If however we abandon - possibly y - this policy of inducements we could squeeze Persia very hard indeed so long as Russia stands and assists us in exercising this pressure. If however Russia collapses we shall loose a great many of our weapons. 7. All the cards, howeverj are not in our hands. For example: OAI* We always have the fear that if we annoy the Shah he will interfere with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. If, however, we lead the Shah to believe that we would react to such interference by military occupation of the wells, the Shah loses this card. 11 Consequently a policy of pressure would have to be.accompanied by |Jsome indication of our military readiness to seize the wells. (b) Transit traffic to the U.S.S.R . If as seems probable the Japanese prevent ships from going to Vladivbstock, our only means of sending Supplies to Russia will be via Persia. The present indications are that the Persians will allow transit/ through their territory of goods other than munitions of war. They are, however, anxious to see the Germans beat the Russians, and consequently, either on their own initiative or under German pressure^they may in practice prove obstructive. It is of course difficult to bring ..economic pressure on Persia by stopping her supplies at the same |time as we propose to use her territory as a channel of communication ? for other goods to Russia. Moreover, if we put pressure on Persia she may stop supplies going to Russia altogether. We would then have to increase our pressure, and possibly - if we attach sufficient importance to keeping Russia supplied - even over-run th*e country. (c) We are at present trying to pre-empt part of the Persian wool clip in order to prevent it all being sold to Germany. 'This is a factor which has influenced the contracts recently made for sugar and cement, but it is of course much less important than (a) or (b).-3- 9 1C. c/jp****- fa t- ?. The general policy advocated in the Government of India’s telegram No. 3389 is practical from the economic point of view, hut our hand would require to be played with great determination and some skill. A large number of Departments are concerned on the economic side and some machinery would have to be evolved for the rapid co-ordination of their plans. At present this is lacking, and delays are consequently arising in the disposal of economic questions affecting the Persian Gulf which, while important in themselves, are not of a nature with which the Ministerial Middle East Committee could suitably be troubled. Some inter-Departmental body of officials - rather on the lines of the Par East Committee under Mr. Butler’s chairmanship, seems desirable. The task could be placed upon Lord Hankey's Committee, but this is primarily a committee dealing with Allied supplies, and is therefore rather tempted to look at questions from the supply rather than from the political point of view. ltd I have the following two points of detail on the Government of India's telegram: (a) As regards paragraph 3 (2), so far as I know the only war material being supplied to Iran are a few aircraft from the United States (which have been dealt with in the External Department), V and a substantial number of lorries. As to the latter see paragraph 2 (d) of this note. (b) As regards paragraph 2 (3), it is, I fear, necessary that we should do what we can to improve communications in Iran in oruer to enable us to send supplies to Russia.

We also regard front Extending from Syria to Sin Kiang as one along which certain portions are more potentially dangerous than others owing to ease of approach and possibilities which they offer for development of comimnications toward India. 2. We will deal more specifically with Afghanistan and Sin Kiang on lYrt ■ receipt of Fraser-Ty tier' s and Ship ton’s views - see our telegram s 3244 a nd ~ 5245 of June 30th. V/e think however that Iran is a key point in this fror ^ r ane mst emphasise that from a military point of view Iran is responsibiliP of India and therefore our views must be taken into account. Iran offers prizes of oilfields, nearer and better approaches for enemy, is.already R. Mi I centre of German intrigue in Asia mid now harbours important Arab revolution- CtfVf Jo TimAuI aries. It would be unsound to assume that Germany may not pea ^ ^ •“ two months reach Caucasus, that Soviet Russia may nr-: re quiesce in C ermr demands, and that with oil at their disposal German forces could not move far and fast and with Iran in prepared state would meet with little or no * difficulty in. country where communicaticn(?s and) other facilities would remain intact. 3o The German technique has followed following lines,. 1. Introduction of specialists in form of key-men in industry; 2c formation by a cove of propaganda agencies and fifth column organisations: 3. reinforcement oC this (? advanced) guard by 'tourists”; 4. occupation and development of aerodromes to 'protect' against aggression country concerned; 5. occupation of country by land forces and its complete domination, think that German, attempt to carry out this policy in Iraq • just prevented by our action, that the first two stages have alreahy benn iuJh $&lt;&amp; TcLka** .prepared in Iran and Afghanistan and the third stage is &lt; •Mtu.

XXX Cypher telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, External Affairs Department, repeated to H.A. Minister, Kabul, dated 25th June 1941. (Number of groups'441). IMPORTANT. 7305. German attack on Russia has introduced entirely new element into situation which affects our whole policy in Central ^sia. It is necessary to consider our attitude towards this development with particular reference to Afghanistan and Sinkiang. It is, of course, too early as yet to guess how the situation may develop but the -following points have occurred to us as arising for immediate consideration:- ■Lg.), xU?ghanistan. Attack on Russia removes for the time being at any rate danger ^ of Russian aggression on Afghanistan v/hich has alv/ays been main obsession of the Afghan Government. At the same time possibility of German trade with Afghanistan is practically excluded except through very long and uncertain route via Iran and Turkey. These two factors should incline the iAghans towards closer co-operation with ourselves if we play our cards well though no doubt the desire to re-insuro against the possibility of a German victory will be a powerful influence on the other side and the .Afghans may well show a tendency to sit on the fence till they see more clearly how Russia stands up to the German attack. The cessation of trade with Germany and the impossibility of her supplying material lor bridges or plant for factories etc. will mean that the raison d etreof the majority of German nationals in ^ gnanistan will disappear and will afford us an opportunity to press for their departure and in view of the economic stranglehold v/hich we and Russia will now have on alfghan trade we might well make it an essential -condition of cny further economic assistance which we give to her that action is taken ao once to cut down the number of Germans in the country. It ,,would be .necessary in that case that we should be prepared to joffer technical experts of our- own to take their place. The method of approach to the Afghans on this subject will require careful consideration but the essential point no doubt is to avoid any suggestion of exerting pressure in combination with Russia. Thismight well frighten the Afghans into keeping m with the Axis as re-insurance against what they might regard as a combined threat to their independence. Note to be struck might be to stress statements in Prime Minister’s broadcast 22nd June that H.M.G. have no greater liking than hitherto for Communism but that any man or State who fights against Nazism will have our aid. I shall be glad to receive your views_and those of Fraser-Tytier on these suggestions and on the position generally. •Oh). Iran. A somewhat similar situation arises here also except that Iran is in more immediate danger from a German Victory and we^have not the same hold on the Iranian Government and little toeffer them. Our main purpose will be to stiffen their morale and their will to resist a throat to their independence. H.M. Minister in Tehran is being asked for his views upon the situation. » Fact that we are now fighting alongside Russia might, afford opportunity to seek with some prospect of success an improvement in the position of our Consul-General at Kashgar and in the treatment of British subjects generally. To promote 4 this/this purpose it might be worth considering whether there any Russian requirements that could be supplied from India vica’ Kashgar or alternatively any local requirements which owing to war strain on transport Russia will no longer be able to meet but India could. X.t would be use£,$J. to th$% trade route working again oven at some financial loss in order to restore our prestige and improve the position of Indian traders on that route.H ITY GRADING j grading of this file must be the same as that of the highest graded document contained in it.

In general, they agree that there is much to be said for this view, but it is considered nevertheless essential to do what we can to organise the transport of supplies across Iran to Soviet Russia, even if this means taking definite steps to improve railv/ay facilities. 2. For your own information, urgent enquiries are being made with a view to supplying at least twelve locomotives and some rolling-stock for the Railway, These locomotives should prove s ufficient to enable the carrying capacity of the railway ~to be increased by/abou-t- 100 tons a day. Much, of course, will depend upon port facilities at Bandar Shahpur and Khoxx 3. Results of these enquiries will be telegraphed to y 0U as soon as possible. 4. We would like, if at all possible, to have British^and Soviet observers in Iran charged with the duty of facilitating the speedy passage of supplies through Iranian ports and over Iranian railways and roads. You should consider, in consultation with your Soviet colleague, and report how this y could best be effected; c.f. in this connexion my telegram No. Ar 374 [of the 12th July: suggesting the appointment of an additTonat^agent of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation to concentrate on transport problems in Iran], M RECn ‘^aL.DCPr, 22 JuL 941 INDIA OFFTCEtfk The. Under Secretary of State * ^ I find it difficult to understand the reasons for the Government of India’s protest against the line taken in the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran of the 14th July which seems to me as a first step to be fully in accord with the Government of India’s own views nor do I know what they mean by saying that no attempt seems to have been made to relate the problem to other parts of Middle iiast security. I can only suppose that it is paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office telegram that has caused the trouble, in which it was stated that in purusance of their general policy, H.M*G. intend to continue to permit the export to Iran of aircraft material and locomotives and to continue commercial transactions. It is, however, made clear in paragraph 4 that the continuation of this policy must depend on the action of the Iranian Government to preserve their independence and their freedom from influences hostile to ourselves, and the following telegram sent by the Foreign Office, No. 383 pointed out that the aircraft material and locomotives would in any case take some months to arrive and could/could always if necessary be cancelled or diverted. It was I think clear from the meeting held at the Foreign Office yesterday that there is no intention of letting further supplies of paw materials go into Iran and that if the Iranians do not take early steps to expel a number of Germans now in the country, economic pressure will be put into force at once. That being so it seems to me that the Government of India f s representations have been substantially met. I submit a draft telegram to the Government of India putting these points but asking them if they are still not satisfied to elucidate their objections further.Draft Paper. XXX J DRAFT TELEGRAM.

The German attack on the Soviet Union has led His Majesty's Government to examine possible developments in ,Iran (Persia), and Noighhouring countries, and they have considered the effects of the new situation on their policy towards Iran. 2. That policy, which it is our earnest desire to continue, may be stated as follows (1) the maintenance of a fully independent Iran; ( 2 ) the promotion of Iranian prosperity; (3) the maintenance of Iran's freedom from the undue influence of any foreign Pov/er. I 3* In pursuance of this general policy it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to continue to permit the export to Iran of aircraft material and to continue « also the commercial transactions now in progress. They also hope to be able to make to the Iranian Government l proposals for the supply of locomotives. 1 , The continuation of this policy of His Majesty*s Government must, however, depend upon the Iranian Government on their side taking proper precautions to preserve their independence and their freedom from influences hostile to ourselves. His Majesty's Government have noted with concern the large and increasing number of Germans resident in Iran. From the example of many other countries there can be no doubt that these persons will be employed whenever it may seem fit to the German Government for the creation of disorder either in Iran it self or in the neighbouring countries. His Majesty's GovernmentGovernment take a grave view of this situation and you should urge upon the Iranian Government the vital importance in their own interests, no less than in that of their neighbours of a drastic reduction in the number of Germans who are permitted to remain in the country*. For your own information, we should wish to see four fifths of the Germans leave in a month. We assume you can check fairly accurately numbers who leave* 5# If it will help you you may say that we shall be prepared to consider sending out British experts to replace Germans in suitable cases but you must not make any promises on this point* 6 * Your Soviet colleague will receive instructions to make parallel representations to the Iranian • : - Government and you should wait till he is instructed and then concert with him in making representations. In doing so you may make use of the description of the policy of fiis kajesty ! s Government as set forth-above.OUTWARD TELEGRAI^T \r This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] . 0 [THIS TELEGRAlvI IS OF P^JlTICULd SEjI Sy-] J.S SiPULD^ 3E ^ RETAINED BY THE AUTHORISED RE^IPTENT AND HOT FiAjSED 0*»Jo [CYPHER], WAR CABIIHiT DISTRIBUTIOH.

Present map of Europe provides an enlightening commentary on the policies of both Germany and ourselves towards small neutral states; and in the one case. (Norway) where we were prepared to abandon our traditional policy, we were not quick enough off the mark. Time l factor is at least as important now, t since in a fev«r weeks the bU.S.S.R. may no longer be in a position to threaten Iran (Persia) \at all. Method of gradually increased infiltration is obviously Jinadequate in such circumstances; and prima facie there seems no ’reason why any demarche which His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran may have in mind should not be simultaneously reinforced by military demonstrat^ns. If these fail of their effect and we then feel unabL to take positive military action, it will not be the first time in history that a military threat has not been pushed to its logical conclusion. Anglo:—Iranian relations, which notoriously are not based on any very high degree of mutual confidence or friendship, could not be greatly prejudiced thereby, and are anyway but a small pawn in this game.&lt; © Ext.5396/41.

R. 2.10 a.m., 31st August, 1941. 3 3 3 / When I saw Vyshinski last night he showed me on Ms map the new line of demarcation for which they had asked, and explained some of their reasons for it. As regards the Caspian littoral to the east of the point suggested by His Majesty's Government, he said that there were certain difficulties as to fishing rights; and as regards the easterly area making a salient to the south, he explained that there were in this area certain mining rights for petroleum which they had had difficulty in arranging to develop with Persia. 2. I told him that this was a. matter to be settled in London, and that I did not propose to butt in on it. 3. I should, however, like to express the opinion that any prolonged occupation of this northern part of Persia by Russia is likely to be dangerous, especially if they have in mind such things as Vyshinski mentioned. Once established there, a whole host of incidents may crop up, each of which will lead to their continued occupation. 4. In view of our quite definite statement that all we went in for was to get the Germans out, I fear that we may be led into a continued occupation to counterbalance ’ Wtf occupation^for^a long period, and without any honest justification for it on the basis of our own statement at the outset. 5. Would it not be possible to limit the period of occupation, subject to compliance by the Persians, with our original demands? I observe from your telegram No. 575 _ to Tehran that while we are proposing to demancT from the Persians an undertaking to 1? maintain a policy of neutrality', we are also proposing £o insist on their facilitating transit of war material across territory: and that, while the Persian Government are to expel che Germans within a week, our withdrawal is not to take place till 'the military situation permits' - a very elastic phrase. It thus seems clear that even His Majesty's Government themselves are tending to drift away from their attitude towards Persia as/2. VJJf as explained to the Turkish Governnent, and announced to the world in general; and with such encouragement, the Russians may he relied upon to drift much further still - to our own ultimate disadvantage. 6. Incidentally, there is an important discrepancy between the second paragraph of the Prime Minister’s message to Stali n (you r telegram. No. 1156) and the proposals in second paragraph (a) ahcTparagraph three (c) of you r te1ngr^ _No. 575 to dlclirar i. according to which British and Soviet forces arc not, apparently, to make contact with one another. ^: reft FiL^ COPY r--y ' r 4 - JL*&lt; u.% — :sTf With tha Com^iewofit^ of the Under See rotary dv f or ^^^5353 31 AU611941 xjCj^o /*&gt;£ &gt;V /K', ^ 9 ^' [This^telegram is of partic and / should be A retained by the authorised re^pieht' and not passed onj# [ Gyp her ] Y/AR OABII'ET DIS'JRIBUTIOH FROM TURKEY 'ROM AITGQRA TO FOREIGN OFFICE. 1 Sir H.

Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had agreed m principle, but had as yet given no definite answer. He asked whether I saw any objection. I said that I saw none though possible difficulties might arise for the Turkish Government if they agreed to these requests. 3.

The Shah is very anxious hearing that the Russians may continue hostilities and occupy Tehran and wondering what would happen to the countrv and to him in that case. Some officers had advised the Shah to take up arms again and fight to the end but Qawam had advised against that and said that the Shah's only hope lay in doing whatever the British might advise. Qawam said that he would consult me as though on his own account and the Shah agreed. 5. I said that resistance to the Russians would be useless and perhaps ruinous to the country. My Soviet colleague and I had no information as to whether the Russians would occupy Tehran. I personally hoped not as it would be better that the capital should remain free from .foreign influence and I was inclined to think that they would not come to Tehran. If the Russians did occupy Tehran, His Majesty must be the best judge of the course that he himself should take. In view of certain tenets held by the Russians I Could understand his uneasiness but whatever he decided to do I was convinced that the Cabinet ought to stay here to negotiate with the British and the Russians. 4. I gathered ominous hints that the Shah had considered either taking refuge in the British Legation or fleeing to some British territory. In reply I talked cheerfully of the large parts of Persia that would probably remain unoccupied whatever happened.

Persian Government constantly endeavoured to maintain friendly relations, especially with its neighbours, with due regard to neutrality. Moreover when the British forces entered Persia, the Persian Government, to show good faith and maintain neighbourly relations, did not embark on war, though when the British forces began to wage war and bombarded towns, the garrison troops in provincial towns had no choice but to resist attack and defend themselves. Now however the Persian Government to prove its desire for peace has instructed its forces to refrain from every form of resistance and to cease every kind of operation.

My telegram No.•614. My immediately following telegram (sent only to the Foreign Office, Government of India and Moscow) gives the text of the note dated August 28th from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A similar note received hy the Soviet Ambassador. 2. The following points occurred in my first conversation with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs today:- (a) The Minister said that the Government .had been re constituted because it was felt that the late Prime Minister did not inspire full confidence. I admitted that I felt that the Shah had not been kept fully informed. The Soviet Ambassador shares this view, but he also showed great dis satisfaction at the version of the crisis given ro Parliament ■ - a matter to which .1 paid little attention in the circuits tances. (b) The Government had decided to cease hostilities. I said that this v/as a wise step and indeed essential. (c) The Persian Government hoped that, in return, the advance of the British and Russian troops would be halted. I said that I had not been informed of the proposed limits of our own advance, let alone the Russian, but I would transmit the request to you. I hope that we can now at least inform the Persian Government what points it is proposed to occupy, so that they may know where they stand. (d) The Persian Government are ready to expel all Germans, without exception, as soon as the road is omen and to try to settle all questions with the two Governments of Great Britain and the U.S.S.R., but without the help of those Governments the Persian Government could not maintain itself, and the best form that help could take would be the with- drawal of foreign forces for[sic. ?from] Persia.

(4) The Minister for Foreign Affairs like the public, seemed io dread the likely occupation of Tehran and to believe that His Majesty's Government ought to, and could, this* I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if iehran was occupied the public would, I believe, find their apprehensions unfounded. I have since learned that the Soviet Amoassador, though without instructions, expects that Russian^ troops will arrive shortly. This will have a good side in that the public, seeing that they are not complete savages will calm down, but I agree that the position* of the Government will be very difficult trying to carry on a policy of co-operation with their capital in foreign occupatipn^and the German wireless in Persia^'*) whipping up hostility against them and perhaps against the .(b) As soori as the. plan of the occupation has been carried out, the programme will presumably be * (a) Rush in supplies, lest we be held responsible for the shortage. I suggested to the Soviet Ambassador that Russia might supply wheat and sugar for the North. (b) Disposal of Germans, taking care that anti-Nazis are not sent to Germany. (c) Negotiate agreement with the Persian Government, having in view the maximum of^co-operation and the minimum of interference with the internal administration of the country.aS&gt; F±mw. , .

Following draft communication to Persian Government : has been prepared here for use in case Persian Government's reply is so unsatisfactory as to render it useless to discuss matters further. You should await further instructions •■before presenting it, although you may now show its text in confidence to your Soviet colleague. Begins. The attention of the Imperial Iranian (Persian) Government has frequently been drawn to the need for taking action to secure the removal from Iran of the . German community. The presence of German technical experts and advisers throughout Iran, employed in factories, and in -public works, as well as on roads and railways - , and in many other important posts where their activities might constitute a serious danger, is regarded by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as a matter of the utmost gravity, which closely affects their own interests. His Majesty s Government have therefore repeatedly urged that a drastic reduction should be made in the number of these Germans, These friendly representations to the Iranian Government culminated in the memorandum communicated to them on the 16th itugust. in which the Iranian Government were urged once again to take steps to arrange for the German community to leave Iran without any further delay. This communication of the 16th August contained a proposal devised in order to meet Iran's special needs, by^which a few Geiman technicians engaged on important work in connexion with Iranian industrialisation projects might be retained temporarily, and it was suggested that a list of^those German nationals whom it might be desired to retain for essential work should be communicated to His Majesty s Minister without delay. His Majesty's Government also offer in this communication of the 16th August, to assist the Iranian Government by endeavouring to find suitably qualified RECd. POL. DEPt. 30AUG 941 INDIA OFFICE British/British or neutral experts to replace the German technicians who had left, and they added that they would gladly concert with the Iranian Government measures to alleviate- any temuorary hardships that might he caused hy the simultaneous departure of large numbers of trained personnel. ... 2. It.is regretted that the Iranian Government have not seen fit to return a satisfactory reply to the memorandum of the 16th August. It is evident that the &lt; Iranian Government attach greater importance to retaining these German nationals in Iran that they attach to meeting the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in a matter which is becoming one of increasing urgency as a result of developments in the war situation. The Iranian Government must bear the full responsibility for the consequences of their decision. 3. In these circumstances His Majesty s Government now feel themselves obliged to take appropriate measures to safeguard their own vital interests ana. to deal yfith the menace arising from the -potential activities of the Germans in Iran. The Iranian Government may be assured that these measures will in no way be directed against the Iranian people. His Majesty’s Government have no designs directed against the independence of Iran or her territorial integrity* Any military measures which British forces may be obliged to take are of a temporary nature only, and will not outlast the present emergency, since they are directed solely against the Axis Powers.

Prime Minister asked me this morning what the Government could do*I suggested that it would be well not to make useless resistance* General counter-attack seems to have been ordered* 2. Prime Minister,to whom I explained that we must await reply to Shah's question, showed the greatest anxiety about the possibility of a Soviet occupation of Tehran. I was able to say with truth that I had no knowledge of Soviet intentions, but I also tried to persuade hhn that a Soviet occupation would be very different from Czarist occupation earlier in the century* He and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs both talked of potential revolution as a result of Bolshevik propaganda, and latter admitted that ground was well prepared by [grp.undec:?threats to] people in North Persia. They both said that Government was prepared to study any demands, and to try to effect^a speedy settlement - only military occupation was to be avoided at.all costs. 3* Public here are terrified lest Russians should occupy Tehran and tend to look to us as at least preferable. I am very careful not to encourage anti-Russian talk* 4* British Consul at Shiraz reports opinion there favourable to us, but will be__ disappointed if the Shah stays in power* This I tHink is pretty general. ^Thefe 'is rl?rpaundec] talk here of a possible coup d etat in favour of Crown Prince, but I cannot learn whether it has any military support [grp.undec] without this it could not succeed.

The Ambassador had stated that British and bovieu troops were advancing into Persia and that open towns had been bombarded. Meanwhile the Soviet and British representatives remained in Tehran and discussions with the Shah were proceeding. Proposals might have been considered during these discussions but he was unaware of the result. He asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he would take an initiative with all the parties concerned in order to reach a settlement. 2 , 'The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed to -r*C on Q 1 -tr-i our + U o 4- 4-U .O • • him the personal view that the presence of Germans in Persia was not the sole tpbiect of our action. He also said that it would not be possible for him to take any initiative unless he was certain that all the parties were ready to accept his advances. * 3. The Persian Ambassador said that if it was-only a question of turning out the Germans, he was certain that his Government would be prepared to come to a settlement. If there were any other points which His Majesty's Government and tne Soviet Government required, he thought that his Government would examine them. 4, The Minister for Foreign /iffairs said that he would inlorm me of the Persian [grp. undec. ? demarche].

Leading article of semi-official Ulus Angora although couched in moderate terms nevertheless declares that Allied 'interference” in neutral country has caused unfavourable impression in Turkey, where respect for other nations* independence is held as matter of principle. Article goes on to say it would seem that Persia had fallen victim to her ownership of territory affording Anglo-Saxon world shortest and safest means of communication with Russia. Ixdam Istanbul (Constantinople) remarks somewhat bitterly that real motive is that Allies need to constitute a common front, in Caucausus and also enable British help to reach Russia. Turkey-remained loyal to principle that nothing can justify crushing a free and neutral country. British policy can satisfy Turkish public opinion only by concluding agreement with Persia.

I understand that Mr. Hull is also telegraphing to United States Ambassador in London on this subject. 3. I think that what is in the Secretary of State's mind is that we should make a declaration more positive than in the 11th and last paragraphs of the Foreign Office statement of 25th August, i.e* that the Anglo-Russian action would promote the security and independency of Persia and other small nations rather than destroy them, as German action certainly would.

Assuming from the nature and time of the presentation of the communication which I was to hand in on'August 25th that hostilities were about to begin, I had warning sent to all British subjects early on August 25th and they assembled quickly and without fuss either at the legation, Tehran, or the summer legation 7 miles away. Indians are in the town legation. Two or three British subjects preferred to stay outside. 2. Tehran is quiet except for bread queues. Germans are too much concerned about their own fate to stir up trouble against Englishmen (Indians would, I think, be safe from this in any case) and the people of Tehran are too much scared of the Russians to let themselves be stirred up. Nevertheless, British subjects will continue to live at the legations on arrival. Officials of the Imperial Bank of Persia and nucleus of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company continue their work. Military are requisitioning lorries and private cars but so far no cars with Europeans in them have been taken. 3, When hostilities seemed imminent His Majesty's Consul at Kermanshah sent away the women and children from there and from Hamadan.

I fear that nothing but fall of the Shah will set us free from identification with his misdeeds but I admit that the question of succession is most difficult. Much will depend on the attitude of Soviet Government and occupying authorities. Soviet Ambassador fully agrees that the British cannot be held responsible for the Shah. He has a low opinion of the Crown Prince, however, whom he found in a recent con versation [?inclined to] adopt the Shah's attitude towards government but with little ability. 2 . ^If the Germans draw near to Persia in Caucasus and the Shah is still on the throne, they will have wonderful chance to win support of the people* However, that moment is some distance away at the worst and our campaign against the Shah could be begun at any time thought suitable.[ Cyph^l DEPARTMENTAL NO.l.

The advantages oi dealing with a ruler who can answer or his country are appreciated, but I think that we must be extremely careful* If the Shah decides upon a policy of co operation with us, the Germans can hardly fail to begin attacks upon him, in order to win the sympathy of the population of Persia* The Shah gained a little in popularity in the early stages of the present crises but that was because the population thought that he had won a victory by an intrepid stand for independence, but now they tend to blame him for having cragged them into war. It would be difficult to ex aggerate his ^ unpopularity and as co-operation with him means supporting him i.e. doing exactly what the people of Persia have always accused us of doing, I think that we should make it a condition that he should meet the popular complaints to some extent e e g. by handing over some of his property to the otate. Pcfour advance must continue At the same time I had ao objection to ^ELs Excellency drawing attention ofAbhe Persian Minister to the attituderor the Government and pres's here to the Shah and to Persia and advising him strongly that collaboration with US''and £oviet Russia ^ was in the interest of the Shah and Persia.

I would also recommend that In connexion with Persia we i should avoid propaganda stressing that our operations will be carried out in such a manner as to [? disturb] Persians as jlittle as possible. Apart irom the fact that such protestations are not believed anywnere outside British Isles and consequently merely lay us open to the usual accusations of hypocrisy, they » Si ve an impression of weakness which is most undesirable. As I j ^ ave sported previously, our inability to appear formidable in the eyes of the Turks and other peoples of the Near and Middle East, has had unfortunate consequences. In the present case, there seems to be an opportunity of impressing the peoples with the knowledge that those who oppose us in our struggle against German despotism are liable to get hurt. If we can put this notion across, the effects are likely to be politically beneficial. Air Headquarters India please pass to Viceroy. (0839/26 G.M.T.) H * i D. 10.46 a.m. 26th August, 1941.

V/e both gained the impression that he was taken aback by the invasion because he had supposed that everything was going nicely and we saw clear evidence that he had not been kept fully informed by his Ministers. Prime Minister who was not present had not conveyed to the Shah^the statement, based on your telegram 543, which I had made to him some hours before. Not that the Shah was impressed by the statement when I repeated it to him: he said it was an odd thing to hear when his towns in Azerbaijan were being bombed. We spent much time in giving him information about the German menace in Persia and the [grp. undec.J of it seemed to be new to him. If, however, he has been acting in ignorance', it is his own fault since he could have summoned us after our representations of July 19th instead of now. Moreover it is possible that any attempt at a settlement would have been wrecked on the invincible objection he showed to communicating to us lists of Germans sent away. That he said would have been in conflict with his 20 years struggle to maintain the independence of Persia. 2« The Shah asked whether Great Britain and Russia were at war with Persia.

Your telegram No. 810. I communicated the statement contained in your telegram under reference to the Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs this morning. They took it well and said that we could count on their supeort and assistance. They pointed out, however, that Iraq was now in imminent danger of war, and that in accordance with Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, consultation between us and them was necessary. They asked for the advice of His Majesty's Government regarding what political and military action was necessary. In particular they referred on the political side to the position of the Iraqi Minister in Tehran and of the Iraqi Consuls at different-places. They wished to know what military precautions are being aken to protect Iraq, and especially Bagdad from aerial and otheif.aiiapk, and What Use could bc~made of 'the Iraqi Army. &gt; They were obviously worried by the absence of anti-aircraft guns here. They raised no objection to the detention of Persian prisoners at Shaibah. While I was with them, the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued instructions that Persian representatives in this country should not be allowed to send cypher telegrams, and that cypher telegrams from Persia to them should be held up for a considerable time. 2. I said that, until the reaction of the Persian Government to our military advance was known, it was not possible to give any definite advice regarding political action which it might be necessary to take. The situation should become clearer in the next day or two and [groups omitted: ?there was] still hope that the Persian Government would realise that it was opposing forces which it could not/not withstand.

I understand that a meeting is taking place to-day. i 5 . I feel sure that the more information we give the Iraqi Government and the more we affect to consult and use them, the readier will be their assistance. A word of approbation from His Majesty s Government would have an excellent effect. 4.

The Shah said that if the cause of attack was that Germany had seized the whole of Europe and that Great Britain and the Soviet Union wish to seize Persia, then Persia was too weak to oppose this. If however only object was the elimination I of Germans, that was already being effected. He said that he had given orders to his Ministers to that effect and assurances to the British Minister that the Germans would be sent away.

Hi® Majesty's Government have therefore x’epeatedly- urged that a drastic reduction should be made in the number of these Germans, These friendly representations to the Iranian in the memorandum communicated to them on the the Iranian Government were urged once again to for the German community to leove Iran without any further delays t This communication of the 16th August contained a proposal devised in order to meet Iran f s special needs, by which a few German technicians engaged on important work in connexion with Iranian induetralisation projects might be retained temporarily, and it was suggested that a list of those German nationals horn it might be desired to retain for essential work should be communicated to His Majestyh-s Minister without delays His Majesty's Government also offered in this communication of the 16th August? to assist the Iranian Government by endeavouring to find suitably qualified British or neutral experts to replace the German technicians who had left, and they added that they would gladly concert with the Iranian Government measures to alleviate any temporary hardships that might be caused by the simultaneous dej^arture of large numbers of trained personnel* 2« It is regretted that the Iranian Government have not seen fi to return a satisfactory reply to the memorandum of the 16th August. It is evident that the Iranian Government attach greater importance to retaining these German nationals in Iran than they attach to meeting the wishes of Hia Majesty 5 s Government in a matter which is becoming one of increasing uxvcency as a result of developments in the war situation.

Addressed to Government of India Simla to Tehran and Secretary of State for India Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. We now appear on verge of war with Persia. However much v/e may wish to limit hostilities to areas selected by us (? it is) unlikely even if Persians were agreeable that their German advisers would allow them to cooperate. I feel we should be prepared for this and make plans accordingly. 2. The following questions require very earl?/ answers. (a) At present we have been refused permission to evacuate British subjects official or non-official or to warn them to leave. In fact our silence has (? lulled) them into false security since question of military intervention has been subject of open discussion for last fortnight, I believe British subjects both official and non-official v/ill be running grave risks after hostilities commence. Is any attempt to be made to extricate them? Persia will be unmoved by any threats of retaliation against their subjects in India and elsewhere. (b) Will Persians outside Persia be treated as enemies? It would be impracticable to take any action against the large and friendly colony on this coast. A few individuals long established in Bahrain are taking out Bahrain nationalisation papers. (c) Is trade with minor Persian ports to continue? Bahrain depends on them for important food-stuffs and only alternative (and far more costly) source would be India with added burden for British bottoms. (d) I presume Senior Naval Officer will instruct steamers if and when they should cease to call at Persian ports? Please confirm. (e) Since we have omitted to warn British subjects of their danger I presume they will be compensated for their losses? Inter alia the Persian Government will probably add to their difficulties by threatening their servants. S. We appear to have only two weapons against Persia - a rapid advance and control of their petrol supply. After Iraq and Syria the first appears unlikely ($ and) one can only hope that they will recognise the second at the outset and yield to it.

Dl RING the course of a conversation with the Soviet Ambassador this afternoon we spoke of our joint plans for putting pressure upon Iran and, after some discussion, his Excellency undertook to telegraph to his Government the suggestion that it might be well if the Soviet Government did not at this stage make any specific reference to the need for an Iranian reply within three days of the presentation of the memorandum. M. Maisky added that he did not, of course, know whether his suggestion would arrive in time to be acted upon, but in any event he did not think that the matter had any great significance. His Government was determined, as he had many times told me, to match their action carefully with ours. They would take no'military steps without our full concurrence and our participation. I need not have the slightest anxiety on this score. His Excellency agreed, however, that it was important to keep in step even in matters of detail, as, indeed, I admitted we had most successfully done in our recent negotiations. I am, &amp;c.

Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs finally assured me that the Persian Government's programme which ho said was prepared at the beginning of the war hut is being accelerated because of our representations, would he faithfully carried out and that sucp Germans as were allowed to stay would he so closely watched that they could not constitute danger to Persian or British interests. All this publicity however only caused delay since the Persian Government could not allow it to appear that they were acting under pressure and they therefore looked to His Majesty's Government to put a stop to it. 4. I replied as follows: while these proposals went a little way towards meeting His Majesty's Government's demands, they differed so widely from them (e.g. 100 instead of about 550) that I saw no prospect whatever of their being •accented. Lists were essential so that we might know exactly who had gone.

I agreed that a weak Persia was not desirable, but said that His Majesty’s Government would not be satisfied with out a definite scheme with complete lists. We did not know who the thirty were who v/ere said to have left, or even whether the 6 per cent had not included by mistake some harmless . |; refugees from Germany,, Then even if the Persian Government's figure of 690 Germans was correct, about 550 should have left H by the end of August, whereas he was talking vaguely about relatively insignificant numbers. 3. I gained the strong impression that the Shah is anxious about his own position. He cannot be entirely unconscious of the general hatred of his rule, and the 'k publicity of which Persia is now the object throughout the world is evidently making him extremely nervous. My impression was strengthened by the discovery that the Minister2 . for Foreign Affairs had not intended to speak to the Soviet Embassy in this sense. The object was, I think, to secure for the Shah the support of His Majesty's Government, who be might hope would influence the Soviet Government in the came direction, and also (such is his ignorance) shut down publicity all over the world. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not in fact speak to the Soviet Embassy on this subject.'It is true that the Ambassador is seriously ill, but they could have seen the Counsellor, to whom I gave the above infomation. A. The high tone in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs proposes to speak to the German suspects is in such contrast with the previous contention that no German could be sent av/ay, because of the Gennan-Persian treaty, without complete proof, that I am inclined to suspect the adoption of a programme agreed with the Germans and designed to keep us in play. However I gave the Minister for Foreign Affair a uo reason to hope that His Majesty's Government would abate their demands. 5.

SE CRET. After I had discussed v/ith Soviet Ambassador on August 13th various details regarding presentation by the representatives of our two Governments at Tehran of the memoranda about the Germans in Iran (Persia), I said that it was essential that we should move in step in our actions and asked whether I v/as right in assuming that ( Soviet Government would in no circumstances authorise their troops to cross Iranian frontier excerat in conformity with similar movement by our troops from the south and after full agreement between the two Governments. Mo Maisky said that this was certainly the . position. After the presentation of the memoranda, ‘ Soviet Government would be ready to take military action, but they would not take such action except in conjunction with us. RECd. POL.

Your telegram No. 503 (not repeated to Bagdad, Cairo Mos cowTT ' Soviet Ambassador had interview of two hours with Prime Minister this morning and only induced him to accept representations in writing hy threatening to demand an audience of the Shah. He had similar difficulty in compelling the Prime Minister to accept copy of memorandum for the Shah. Thanks to this, I had an easier task when I saw the Prime Minister this evening, though the Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs together tried to dissuade me from leaving my memorandum. 2. Prime Minister represented His Majesty's Government as giving ultimatum, as being blind to difficulties of the Iranian Government and as having other aims than elimination of Germans. Conversation, which lasted If hours, covered ground already covered many times. When Prime Minister assured me that the Iranian Government were taking serious steps to eliminate Germans and I asked for figures, he said 30 or more had gone in 3 weeks and more were going imperceptibly, I said that at this rate it would take 2 years to effect serious reduction. He announced as a | great secret that Mayer and Gamotta would be going soon. 3. Prime Minister spoke as though the measures Iranian Government were taking, though highly successful, were so discreet as not to be noticed by Germans. This is absurd, and I assured the Prime Minister that it was waste of time to look for a magic number so large as to satisfy His Majesty's Government and so small as to be imperceptible to Germany. j) 4.

He had received instructions to give direct assurance as well as to inform Minister for Foreign Affairs of memorandum handed to the Iranian (Persian) Government. 2. We each read summary of your memoranda. I think that my Soviet colleague^ document was a reproduction in extenso of memorandum handed to the Iranian Government. It contained a reference to the insistence that 80% of the Germans should be turned out by the end of the month. 3. We handed copies to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the form of aide-memoire and then read and handed direct assurance in the form of memoranda. These were identic in terms given in the first para graph of your telegram No. 1781. 4. The Minister for Foreign Affairs first asked why pur action had been postponed from August 14th to August 16th (see m y tel egram No. 1968 1st paragraph). He seemed to suspect that wenad~wai ted till' 2 days after the representations in Tehran. This having been cleared up he made a remark to the effect that we had avoided letting him know in advance of the proposed action. I said on the contrary he and I had discussed the question more than once, e,g* my telegram No. 1958. He admitted this. 5* He then asked me iflha! any idea as to how the Iranian Government*would take our representations. I said that it was impossible to say. but they had already turned out a few Germans. I suggested that he should urge the Iranian Government to comply as this was in the interests of all of us. He said that this would be difficult because the ( Germans had recently informed the Iranian Government that Turkey might attack Iran (I gathered, in combination with Germany). 6 . He harped a good deal upon the question whether we were really taking this action solely on account of Germans in Iran. We both assured him that this ,was the case. I reminded him of the consequences of the Fifth Columnin other countries and we pointed out that they existed even in South America and no doubt also in Turkey. I also informed him of ? the fourth paragraph of Tehran telegram No. 491. put it was | pretty evident that he~renains'~suspT:cious that-wc have ulterior | motives.

The question of propaganda against the Shah would be completely altered in tne case of Russian-British ultimatum, which was to be followed by military action in a few days in case of non-compliance. To forestall the Germans and to make prospect of occupation more palatable we might simultaneously with ultimatum release articles and wireless talks about Iran (Persia), referring not only to 'fhe good points, but to the great defects of the present regime, e.g. compulsory acquisition of the best land at dishonestly low prices and enormous rise in the cost of living on account of monopolies. By then it should be too late for the Shah to throw himself into the arms of the Germans, while the army, which is strongly anti-Shah, would be encouraged to turn against him rather than obey any order he might give to resist occupation. All this is speculation and it is notoriously difficult to foretell how -tortuous- Iranian (Persian) *minds* will work, but I am sure that the policy i suergested is ^safer than to do nothing and- to let the people conclude with Germans encouragement that we are still : * : in league ^ with the Shah*. 22 t As the army and the people might demand a change : * : of ruler* we mustf be ready with an alternative* If the country was partly occupied by foreign troops or alternatively cleared of Germans, qualities of the Crown Prince should be adequate to the position. He seems to be the [grp. undec: ? best] candidate because (1) He is not unpopular with the army. (2) He talks English and French, takes a nate of affairs and gladly sees foreigners when he can. (5) He has the prestige of connexion by marriage with the Egyptian Royal family. (4) His accession should avert a struggle between rival generals which will be embarrassing to us. To make his accession^popular^it v/ould be reported^that compulsorily by the Shah should be declared State lands. some measure oi reducing uu^u uj. be passed (e.g. tea monopoly which when ^ ecc ply established raised the cost of * coram on* tea by *50*% ❖nrmld he* abolished') and that *the* estates acquire 3 . I request your authority to discuss this with my Russian colleague. It v/ill be realised that Russian occupation would cover Mazanderar where the best of the Shah* s illegally acquired estates are and that^ even if the Russians refrained from propaganda, their presence would probably cause a rise [sic: ? rising] against the Shah as landlord. 4.

His instructions had arrived, and we had discussed the communications to be made. He has received for communication to the Turkish G-overnment, a summary of the memorandum to be handed by the Soviet Ambassador to the Iranian (Persian) Government. On general lines it corresponds closely with our memorandum, but there are obvious, though unimportant differences, due no doubt to the fact that the same circumstances are not applicable to both Governments. 3. He has however no instructions to give direct assurance_ to the Turkish authorities on the lines of your telegram No. 1781, first paragraph. 4. This raises two points; (a) that assurance to be given by che Soviet Government to the Iranian Government should correspond as closely as possible with text of second paragraph of your telegram No. 1781. Otherwise, if the Turkish Government can^discover any difference which suggests to them that the Soviet assurance does not go so far as our own, it will arouse suspicions. (b) that either my Soviet colleague should receive instructions on the same lines as the first paragraph of your telegram No. 1781 to (sic) give assurance direct to Turkish Government as well as informing them of assurance given to the Iranian Government. 5. As regards (a), v/ording of Soviet assurance is contained in my immediately following telegram. Inclusion ^ of the words '’which Iran is pursuing at present O’actuelle- ment 1 ’)'’ in Soviet cpmmunication and not m ours may be noticed by the Turkish Government, and misinterpreted as a limitation, however unreasonably. It would be better if we could adopt the same text, or at all events, if he could drop the word ’’actucllemont'., 6 .

In doing so you can point out that it is logical to differentiate . between Germans and other foreigners. Experience of Nazi methods in other countries has shown that the introduction of agents as technicians or tourists has been a consistent feature of German attacks on neutrals. These people are in fact an important weapon of German penetration, and are deliberately selected by their Government for this purpose.

Repeated to G-overniiient of India No. 9141. ddddddd You should on 11-th August present to the Iranian Grovernment a memorandum in the following terms, and should also endeavour if possible to hand a copy to the Shah, or at least to ensure that His Majesty receives a copy without delay. If you think it desirable, you are authorised to explain that the memorandum may be regarded as a document confirming an oral communication which you have been instructed to make. Memorandum begins: !f The Imperial Iranian Government have on many occasions affirmed their desire to maintain an attitude of the most scrupulous neutrality towards the conflict which has been forced upon the world by the aggressive ambitions of the present rulers of Germany. This, ( desire to remain outside the zone of hostilities was equally felt by'other States who have since been attacked or overrun by the German armed forces,. It is in the light of this incontestable fact that His Majesty’s Government now feel themselves obliged to put forwaru in the most friendly spirit certain observations to which they must draw the Iranian Government's serious attention, 2, In the first place His Majesty's Government wish to emphasise the fact that they themselves fully accept and endorse the Iranian policy of neutrality. They have themselves no designs against Iran's political independence. It is their sincere desire to maintain that policy of friendship and co-operation with Iran which they believe to be in the best interests of both Iran and the British Empire. 3. With the development of the war, however, a serious danger both to Iranian and to British interests has become manifest, m So long ago as January last .Bis Majesty's Government brought to the notice of the Iranian authorities their grave concern in regard to the excessively large number of German nationals who have been permitted to reside in Iran, Since that date they have repeatedly warned the Iranian Government of v the potential dangers arising from the activities of these German nationals, and of the importance, in Iran's/Iran's ov/n interests, of effecting a drastic reduction in cheir numbers. There can indeed be no doubt, in view of what has happened in many other countries, that these persons employed, v/henever it may seem to the German Govern ment that the appropriate moment has arrived, to create dis orders, either in Iran herself or in neighbouring countries, with a view to assist the execution of Germany's military plans. Towards the end of July, His majesty's Government, realising that the representations previously addressed on .he subject to the Iranian authorities had remained without effect, instructed their representative at Tehran again to impress upon the Iranian Government, as a matter of the utmost gravity and urgency, the need for taking immediate action, xn view of the ever-increasing danger of the war situation, Sir R. Bullard was instructed to press for a drastic reduction in the number of Germans who were permitted to remain in the country. 5. The Iranian Government appear to recognise in principle the wisdom of the advice given to them by His Majesty's Government and have indicated that they are taking steps to ensure that Germans whose residence permits have expired, whose conduct is suspect, or who can be replaced by Iranians, should leave the country as soon as possible. The Iranian Government have also admitted the obligations incumbent upon them to keep under strict control the activities of such Germans as remain. The number of Germans who have in fact left the country is, however, very small, and it appears that the Iranian Government have still failed to realise the urgency of the problem and the gravity with which it is regarded by His majesty's Government, 6 . In these circumstances, His hajssty's Government now wish-to repeat, in the most formal and emphatic manner, their recommendation that the German community in Iran should be required to leave the country without any further delay. /♦ If the Iranian Government should wish to retain temporarily a few German technicians now engaged on important work in connexion with Iranian industrialisation projects, it is requested that a complete list showing the names of those technicians whom it is desired to retain and the exact nature of the work on which they are employed should be communicated to His majesty's Representative at Tehran, His Hajesty's Government would expect this list to be kept as small as possible. His Majesty's Government would themselves be willing to assist the Iranian Government by endeavouring to a.ind suitably qualified British or neutral experts to replace I the German technicians who have left and they would gladly ! concert with the Iranian Government measures to alleviate )&lt; | any temporary hardships that might be caused by the simul taneous departure of so large a number of trained personnel.(§) 19 41 3, 8 . As regards the remainder of thF^Bimhr^cinmTtinity, His li^^sty’s Government v/ill be grateful to be kept closely informed or^ae dates of their departure. The Iranian Government will no \ doubt arrange that no further German nationals shall be permitted I to arrive in Iran. 9. It is important that none of the German technicians to be retained under the arrangements contemplated in paragraph 7 above should be employed on work connected with the Iranian system of communications, e.g. railways, roads, telephones, telegraphs and [ wireless, or where their harmful activities might paralyse the national life of Iran during a period of crisis. 10. Finally, it is urged that effective steps should be taken to place under strict surveillance and to restrict the movements of the German technicians who are to be retained under the arrangements contemplated in paragraph 7 above, in order to ensure that they shall not engage in activities of any kind other than the technical work for which their services have been secured. 11. It is requested also that similar steps should be taken to control the activities of the refugees who fled from Iraq on the collapse of the illegal Government set up in that country by Rashid Ali Gailani. The Iranian Government are under a clear obligation to take effective measures to prevent the use of Iran ian territory by these refugees for their intrigues directed against the Iraqi Government and their Allies. Repeated requests have been sent to the Iranian authorities since these refugees first reached Iran at the end of May that they should not be allowed to remain in Tehran, but should be interned in some provincial city far from the Iraqi frontier, that they should be kept under strict police super vision, both as regards their movements and their visitors, and that they should be required to give written guarantees to abstain from every kind of political activity while in Iran. In spite of repeated representations from His Majesty's Government and from the Government of Iraq, the Iranian Government appear to have taken no adequate steps to control these persons, who remain in the neigh bourhood of Tehran, whose movements are unrestricted and who are understood to be in close and constant touch with the diplomatic representatives of the countries with which His Majesty’s Government are at war. It is evidently necessary that steps should at once be taken in accordance with Iran's international obligations in this matter. 12. The Iranian Government have already, it is understood, arranged for a careful investigation to be made into the position respecting the German nationals resident in Iran and full information is no doubt available to show the alleged reason for the presence of each individual. It is hoped therefore that the list of any German nationals whom it may be desired to retain for essential work may be communicated to His Majesty’s Minister without delay and that steps may be at once taken to arrange for the immediate departure from Iran of the remainder of the German community'. Memorandum ends. ► \ /■■■MMt v/' The Government of Indian telegram No.4188 cf the 11th August . I am puzzled to understand why the Government of India have thought it necessary to apologise for having sent the Political Resident with hisindispensdhle staff and essential secret .records to Bahrein, This seems a very good thing to have done, and if I am not mistaken, the Service representatives at discussions on action in Persia expressiHhe view that it would he better if the Political Resident was not at Bushire. I cannot that the passages referred to in our telegram 9259 suggest that we wanted the Political Resident at Bushirejunless the Government of India think that we might feel he ought to he there in order to try and save British subjects from possible maltreatment. If I am right as to the views of the service representatives, we might, subject to Foreign Office concurrence, send a - telegram to the Government of India to the effect that there are no objections to the absence of the Political Resident and that in fact, the Service Departments were of opinion that this would be preferable . j £ .T* , 3 ^Allot ted fro External DepartiiW^ y Hi ^ v 1 4763 1941 SECRET©) i 328 D E C Y P H E .R OF T K L E G R A M .

Tehran No. 105. //// The Iranian (Persian) Ambassador came to see me yesterday, with the obvious intention of talking to me about the situation arising out of the joint demands for the expulsion of Germans. He stated that the Iranian Government had informed the Soviet Government that they could not accept the demands that had been made in the form in which they had been made, as it would be inconsistent with their national sovereignty. The British demands had been made in a less difficult form, and the Iranian (Persian) Government were doing their best to diminish the number of Germans as quickly as they could* 3rd August, 1941. to e&gt;* !£ i fj j t-K CT j 2 Z) .3 ry a LT5 O U ft 2. I pointed out that this was rather a vague statement and asked whether it would not be possible for the Iranian Government to produce an actual time-table showing v/hat, in fact, it meant, i.e. giving the number of Germans who would be leaving each week, and uhe number that would remain at the endof two or three months. He said that he thought 'that this could be done. He pointed out that his Government tyjere in some difficulty, as they had many nationals and much property in Germany v/hich they did not want to lose. He i&amp;s sured me again and again that they would not allow the tfi-ermans to create any trouble, but I pointed out that quite lot of other countries had thought the same thing, but ffcad afterwards found that Fifth Column activities had over- Cjrfielmed them.

His figures differed from those in second paragraph of my telegram No. 475 onl y in that ten Germans with expired permits have oeen told to leave instead of six. He stated* however, that he had refused visa for additional Press Attache for the German Legation and had forbidden Iranian (Persian) representatives in Berlin and Angora to grant visas to members of the staff of the German Legation in Tehran without reference to him. I learn from outside, that two German journalists on their way to Afghanistan have been unable to obtain permission to visit provincial towns in Iran. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs could not say that any Germans had actually left, but promised fugures. I pressed again for the expulsion of the [grp. undec.] intriguer Mayr immediately, but was again met with a plea for a few days to find evidence. There is no doubt that the Iranian the situation now that Soviet -v - are united on this point, they consider that to expel a large portion of Germans would be to side with the Allies and to abandon neutrality. 2. Both Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the hinted that the Soviet Ambassador created hafficulty by putting in writing a request for a four-fifths reduction. On the other hand, they described the wording of Mr. Hden s statement in the House of Commons as entirely correct. 1 do not think this was [grp. undec.] attempt to sow dissension between us. I,did not know beforehand that the Soviet request w S S xJ? ° e in or I should have asked whether you approved of this procedure. -j-i .

I * ' • r, difficult to foresee' the exact effect in this country ol military action against Iran (Persia) without first sounding various prominent Iraqis, _ My impression is that the first reaction would not be hostile. Rumours of our intention to advance into Iran have been current for over a week and have ^ n 5 rea ^ ec ^ sin £? your statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday. The effect so far reported has been favourable because the Iranian is heartily, disliked. Possible implications nave o not however been thought out nor has Nazi propaganda yet got +v . , ..^.5 an P?^ Jo^etell the reaction of [grp. undec. Is. I think individually they would be pleased but Iran would no doubt make an appeal under *Saadabad* Pact and their attitude might be influenced by that of the other signatories. * , ..§• ^ seems to me therefore very important that our demand pe presented persuasively and at once. I suggest that we should take the line that we have evidence that the ° — 5mans are trying to set up in Iran the same kind of fifth column organisa- tion as they set up in Iraq with the help of Rashid Ali and that rneir object is^firstly to dominate Iran *in order to use^ ; it as a base for ^Iraqis now there, and secondlv, if they defeat Russia, to attack Iraq through Iran’ Their plans are thus an’even greater danger to Iraq than to Great Britain. As was the case in wo months^ago action will be necessary to prevent fulfilment oi these plans if Iranian Government will not itself eradicate uerman influence and we count upon the support of the Iraqi Government m dealing with the matter which affects us both. ^ f- I suggest that a communication on these lines should be aomp P?rp^+ Government &gt; and that extensive propaganda to the me 2- tloni ng the possibility of action) should be started in the near future throughout the country in order to forestall the inevitable German propaganda movement; We shouldmmm jm 2. be giving nothing away since rumours are already rife and everyone assumes from your statement that some action must I oil ow non-compliance by the ^'Iranian* Government with our demands. x I? ^ ra -0- Government wish to make parallel representations to the Iranian Government I think they should be allowed to do so. . ., military action is taken much will depend on its initial success especially against the Iranian air force, ine public will no doubt fear air reprisals and if they took place, especially against Bagdad, feeling would run strongly against us and there might be trouble. Otherwise I should' overt action against us or any interference milr secnirity movements on the part of [grp. undec. ] population, ihe influential Ulema might attempt to make trouble with the Euphrates tribes in the Holy Cities. They might cause some trouble but they are unarmed. The Iranian Government might attempt to send Iraqi officers in Iran to Iraq in order to corrupt the army but I doubt if they would succeed and I question whether the army would obey the orders. , The above views are based on the supposition that we - e a 2Qylicence of the Iraqi Government in cur action. C 1 tbeir attitude is lukewarm, enemy propaganda will of course have a much greater effect. They would probably resign rather °PP? se actively and in that case a serious situation would arise. I think however that there is a good prospect of gaming them and I should like to start at once. '!^ e Intention of His Majesty’s Government to announce, if military action is taken, that’ we have no designs on the territorial integrity of Iran?

I hoped and believed that the pressure would increase if our perfectly legitimate requirements were not met.

These persons at large in Iran constitute a grave danger to us. The three Governments together could bring adequate pressure on the Shah in getting their way. He should be asked to send away all Germans other than members of the Legations and Consulates. If necessary they and rebellious Iraqis should be interned at considerable distance from the — frontier.

We have discussed your 99S2/C with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and it has been decided that we should go ahead at once with all preparations to take military action on lines suggested in our 80081 of 25th July, and generally agreed by you. 2. It is proposed to aim at 12th August as the date for an ultimatum to the Iranian Government demanding expulsion the Germans, if diplomatic pressure should have failed to achieve this by then. Necessary movement of forces should therefore be completed by that date, if possible. We think it important, however, that no movement into Iran should be made until all, or nearly all, the necessary forces are ready. Please report whether you can wofk to the date proposed. 3. Reference your para. 1. We think that a mechanised cavalry brigade _ or equivalent force should be added if it can be made available either in Iraq or from Middle East. 4 . - 4. Reference para. 2. We do net agree that we should occupy Bushire for the following reasons. (a) The occupation of Bushire cannot be represented to the Shah as co-operation in the defence of interests common to him and ourselves. (b) We do not want to tie up forces in an area remote from the oilfields and serving no military purpose.' On the other hand we feel that to evacuate the Resident would be inconsistent with line proposed to be taken with the Shah. ' , . 5. Reference your para. 3. We agree that no attempt should be made to evacuate our nationals before military action is taken. 6. Soviet Government have suggested that we should not only demand expulsion of the Germans but also road and rail facilities in Iran. It has been decided that it would be wiser to do one thing at a time, ana that our original demand should relate only to the expulsion oi German nationals from /'-'N /Soviet Iran.-2' ' Soviet Gtovelament Sire 'being informed accordingly* 7* Soviet Government have informed us that they are v/illing to tak e,^ part in joint military plans and have agreed that concentration of their forces aid ours should precede presentation of our joint demands. , .They have also suggested that co-ordination of action of British and Russian . forces earmarked for Iran should be arranged in Moscow. This would clearly be undesirable, and it is being suggested to them that staff conversations , , are unnecessary, since the British and Russian forces will be operating from different directions and not conjointly. They are being told that we will keep them informed of the military action we propose, and hope that they will do likewise, and that once operations have started the Military Commanders on the spot will of course keep each other mutually informed of-progress and intentions.

He had however received telegrams from Moscow giving proposals of the B ritish Governmont fox* action in the event of Prime Minister refusing to reconsider his decision regarding Hentig i.e. proposals given in paragraph No.4 (a) of Government of India telegram 35(?83). 3. Ambassador* was inclined to criticise these proposals as not likely to have (?decisive) effect and to do little more than irritate Afghans without seriously embarrassing them. He suggested that if his representations failed we should take immediate joint action to establish economic blockade. (?0elay) in getting effect to strong measures would in his opinion merely afford Germans opportunity to (?consolidate) (?their) position and put forward proposals to Afghans for measures to meet the situation. 4. I am inclined to agree with the Ambassador* As His Majesty 1 s Government have decided on policy of coercion and time is of importance there appears (?little) object in delaying (?firm) application of economic blockade proposed in paragraph No.4 (b) Government of India telegram. Swift and firm action now would bring home to the Afghan Government that we are in earnest and might cause them to reconsider their attitude. Delay (Vwill) (?give) Germans opportunity to increase their (Vhold) on Afghan Government and (?embitter) them further thus making eventual success of economic pressure more difiicult.

He declared that Iranian Government were conscious of need for vigilance, and were doing their best to reduce number of Germans, only it needed time.

Six Germans whose residence permits expired ordered to leave. [Grp.undec] formed to take over radio station so that two Germans can leave. Three Germans to leave from Pahlevi. About ten more Germans to leave in about ten days. All appointments in Government factories etc being examined with a view to the replacement of Germans wherever [grp.undec ?possible] by Iranians, and orders given to all private factories to replace foreigners (most of whom are Germans) by Iranians wherever this is feasible. 3. As to Tabriz, Prime Minister said not only had he issued strict orders for every German to be listed and reported on at once, but he had ordered Director of Police to come to Tehran for personal orders. 4. Prime Minister said that A second gunboat had been posted at Bandar Shahpur and enemy vessels could not move. I have telegraphed separately about that. 5. I spoke to the Prime Minister and also the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs most seriously about the possibility of a coup d'etat, sabotage, etc, and again mentioned the names of three Germans as particularly dangerous. /PrimePrime Minister assured me that he was doing vcverything he could to find some [2 grps.undec] two of them, hut spoke of ten days^as necessary for enquiries.

If economic pressure is applied, I think that publicity should he confined at least in the first instance to stating that we cannot supply valuable goods and use of precious shipping to carry them to and from country where large number of Germans are allowed to remain in key positions. This could be accompanied by tales of fifth column work in the Netherlands and elsewhere. 3. We have to assume that German wireless, which is very popular in Iran (Persia), would still be unfettered, while German community, even if considerably reduced, could still carry on propaganda by word of mouth on a scale that we could not touch. 4. I cannot imagine a weaker ground on which to fight Gothhis tan Hat cf industrial development. In Iranian (Persian) eyes we have very bad reputation on this score - complete indifference before the war and since the war began [at least until quite recently), contracts made only to be broken. Germans v«ould not fail to suggest that we were playing the game v/e played in India, namely, suppressing or retarding native industries for benefit of our own, and would point out that if Iran had only carried out further its policy of industrialism, and been able to make, for example, more beet sugar and more textiles, she could snap her fingers at the brutal British blockade. And so on. 5. To forestall accusation that we wished to intimidate Iranian industries by removing technicians of vital importance* we might say from the start that v/e realised this difficulty, but uhat it is over a year since fifth column methods were first revealed to the world, and there has been time to engage specialists from neutral countries though thanks to German aggression many countries from which such specialists could nave been obtained have admittedly been over-run and enslaved.

Nor am I convinced we could escape our alleged responsibility for Shah by attacking him.

On the contrary it would be a long time before they produced any effect at all and as the Government of India have emphasised, time is of ~) r \*AM importance.

There is general agreement that the Gemans must be expelled from IRAN as soon as possible. If this can be done by Anglo-Russian diplomatic pressure, possibly backed by show of force, so much the better. If not, it would be necessary to use force. With a view to forming an idea of the implications involved in the latter course, we have prepared an outline plan, and informed the Foreign Office that, subject to your general concurrence, they may taice it that the requisite forces for taking a strong line in IRAN are available. 2. Outline plan divided into two phases. 5. Phase 1 would, in our view, involve concentration of following (a) Move to Iraq of some or all of the air forces earmarked by Air Officer Ccoeanding-in-Chief, for operation 'Raspbeny 1 ' up to four repeat four bomber squadrons to be prepared to operate from Northern Iraq against military objectives in Teheran. One repeat one fighter squadron to move into Southern Iraq to be readily available for defence of Iranian oil fields. (b&gt; Concentration of striking force on Iranian frontier in Basra area.

A meeting attended by representatives of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Economic Jarfare and the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation was held at the India Office on the 24th July to consider the question in what way economic sanctions could best be applied to Iran, supposing that Ministers decided in principle that such economic sanctions must be imposed. The meeting considered the suggestions in Sir Reader Bullard’s telegram No. 442, of the 19th July. (1) Creating difficulties about further conversion of sterling into dollars . It was agreed that since, under present arrangements, the next quarterly sum of £750,000 is not due for conversion until the beginning of October, this point does not arise in the near future. (2) Withholding of shipping for Iranian ports . It was agreed that this measure would be no less detrimental to British interests than to Iranian interests, more particularly in view of the probability of Iranian reprisals against British tankers visiting Abadan, and in view of the fact that it is desired to keep open the Trans-Iranian route as a line of supply ' to Soviet Russia. (3) Refusing to supply goods urgently needed by Iran, viz eggs, tea, sugar, cement, tyres, cotton and woollen goods, locomotives, aircraft material . It was agreed that a refusal by His Majesty’s G-overnment to supply such commodities, even allowing for corresponding action by the Soviet Government, would not be likely to produce any early effect on the Iranian Government’s attitude, or induce them to agree /toto expel the German colony. On the contrary, such economic sanctions would take a long time to produce any effect at all. ^he goods which it was proposed to withhold might he divided into two categories: (a) those whose shortage would effect the Iranian populace, and (b) those whose shortage would effect the Shah’s schemes of industrial development and other government enterprises. As regards (a), attention was drawn to the view expressed by the Government of India in paragraph 4 of their telegram No.3690, that the Iranian populace would not long sustain being deprived of such goods as sugar, tea and piece goods and that they could be made to understand that the restoration of the supplies depended solely on the expulsion of German technicians and tourists. The meeting thought that, while this might have some effect in the long run on the Iranian populace, it was doubtful whether the result would be to benefit British interests, but on the other hand, it was absolutely certain that German propaganda would make the most of our action. As regards (b), it was pointed out that a refusal to supply cement etc., would not seriously affect the Shah's development schemes. In any case, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation were committed to supplying 45,000 tons of cement and 30,000 tons of sugar (negotiations were now in progress regarding large amounts of tea), and a refusal now to supply these goods could not be made without breaking contracts, involving serious breach of faith. Moreover, the United Kingdom Commercial CorpcratLcn would lose the wool bought in Iran, which has cost us between £250,000 and £500,000 sterling. It was also pointed out that Iran has been able since the war began to obtain so few of her supplies from the United Kingdom, that any refusal now to supply goods would merely be regarded as a further sign of our inability to export. The meeting agreed that there was no objection to Sir Reader Bullard’s suggestion, in his telegram No. 454 /(Part III),(Part III), that the next step should he to tell the Iranian Government that unless they guarantee that a large proportion of Germans will leave Iran very soon, His Majesty’s Government will he obliged to re-examine their policy in regard to Iran. In general, the meeting took the view that economic sanctions, or the threat of them, would prohahly he ineffective, and that the whole problem really depended upon the feasibility of military measures in conjunction with the Russians. Economic pressure by itself would be very slow in producing results and such results as were produced might not be favourable to the Allied cause.Secretary of State for India. Government of India telegram 5710 of July 22nd. The Government of India do not seem to understand the Iranian situation at all. There has never been any question of appeasement. This does not happen to he a policy in which I personally believe or would ever practice, but it is an elementary principle of diplomacy, or should be, not to embark upon action which may result in hostilities until the necessary forces are available to deal, with any enemy reaction.' It was for this reason, as you will be aware, that the Middle East Committee at its last meeting asked the Chiefs of Staff for an appreciation of the forces which could be made available to defend^as a minimum x the oil fields in Southern Persia before we took any action which might involve us in hostilities with Persia. The Chiefs of Staff’s first report showed that there were barely sufficient forces in Ir&amp;fi/for local requirements (of all this the Government of India must have been aware since Iraa/is under their military jurisdiction).In order therefore to have the forces available for emergency in Persia, which the Prime Minister and the C.T.Gr.S. estimated at 2 Divisions,it will be necessary to move forces into Irac^/from elsewhere in the Middle East. This further problem is now being studied by the Chiefs of Staff and until this fundamental question is cleared up it would be unwise to threaten the Persians or to engage in economic sanctions which, after our Abyssinian experience, all would agree should only be imposed if military force is available to back them* As it is, we have already information that the Persians have concentrated troops in the neighbourhood of Tabriz and Ahwaz. The Government of India can be sure that as soon as the necessary forces are available I will not be backward in insisting that the Germans leave Iran. I should be grateful if you would put this in any way you consider diplomatic to the Government of India. If we seemed to be appeasing at first it was only because, as they should have realised, we must .... concentrateMeanwhile I hope that they will be as successful in clearing up the situation in Afghanistan!FILE CO^in ^i l£C j tt is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept 'N U*&gt;4&lt; ) rwc k X u/ ^ - [CYPHER] under Lock and Key.] r 4 0 0 1 Q i ^jBKER. i L DISlRIBUTI Ccf. -J g ^ -i l^OR IRAN (PiaSTA^, gRO,, xJR tiN T O PORSIGM OFPIC R Sir R.Bullard,.

What would probably scare the Germans away would be Russian troop concentration on Iranian border in the Caucasus since an aovance in that direction would cut the only way of retreat to Germany. I am however opposed to threats v/hich would not be followed up if ineffective. On the other hand I share the apprehension of the Government of India against a Russian occupation north of Iran tharugh I do not share their hope that soviet Russia (unless her condition was desparate) would allow us to occupy South Iran while they refrained from entering Iran on the' north.

We have throughout stressed that for geographical and other reasons Iran is key point and we have held that time factor does not permit of pursuit of policy even on temporary basis, of offering inducements 0 Even now we cannot disguise our apprehension that development of positive policy vis a vis Iran is too faltering in conception. 3.

Foreign Office t Ilf eT‘am Ro.. 383 to Tehran dated July 15t h,.- “ We are in full agreement with implied expectation tha1 policy outlined in Foreign Office i e^r^n-, nil (y p; n ; r -n. to secure the elimination of German influence in Iran^ and w it would be well to indicate immediately the lines on which guv minds are moving in regard to the next phase, viz h'' anrl leaf or of economic pressure. There are certain fundamental factors which must nor be ignor Q d ana of these the most, important as we s-^ th c *m are as follows; (1) (a) (V potential) military commitments imst !- limited to essentia3.s. (d) These are protection of Atadan and o1)fiei h with possible addition of Bushire. (c) Both to offset enemy propaganda dij-ecte &lt; to neutral and possibly to Shia Muslim (? opinion) (though we are not impressed by evidence of (? Shia) solidarity)* and to avoid encouragement of Russiaxt occupation of Northern Provinces we nrust be in position to represent such military action as defence &gt;f ou vital interests against German directed or inspirea aggr ssion. (2) (a) There are widespread poverty ana nea starvation throughout Iran,. Reports from many sources suggest that serious disorder or even insurrection against Shah dictates regime may be imminent. ^ (b ) Shah’s policy of Industx* 1 alisation and modernisation' have (apart from his insatiable greed for property) r-een mainly responsible for (? impov iish)rient of country and export of reserves of foodstuffs in return for technical equipment largely of German origin. (3) (a) There is widespread belief that British wer- responsible for elevation of Reza Shah and are still his main support. It is of primary importance that we should take all possible steps to divest ourselves of odium attaching to this Imaginary association and to pass it to Germans who have made use of Shah's craze for industrialisation to achieve their present position, (b) As corollary^ if Reza Shah .were de posed he would be to uc dangerously unwelcome refugee (it must be remembered that he has behind him no fmotion of tradition). RICd. POL. DEPt 22 JUL 941 INDIA OFRCE 4 ./4* '/ith these considerations in mind v/e recommend that the anticipated Persian refusal to extern Germans should be followed at once by threat, to be implemented with the minimum of delay, of the stoppage of all supplies from the British .mpire, Russia, Netherlands Bast Indies and if possible the United States of America, We do not believe that the general public of Iran whose sentiments of national loyalty are still ill-developed, would long sustain the df3prival of items such as sugar,- tea, piece goods and cheap bazaar articles particularly if they could be made to understand that the restoration of supplies depended solely on the expulsion of German technicians and tourists. Concurrently outspoken press and radio propaganda on this theme would be required and should be aimed at directing thought op the lines indicated in para. 3 (2) (b) above (possibly omittiiVg personal reference to the Shah in the early stages), ^“ l* 0 interpolate here that so far as India is concerned the process of applying economic pressure would amount only to refusal of all export licences for (? Iran) withholding of cargo space for e.g, Japanese merchandise awaiting opward shioment from Indian ports. . The result might be an immediate attempt by 3hah at forcible expropriation oi a• 1*0.0, property. If so we are at once provided with cover for occupation of oilfields and refinery areas ' - 1 ' para. 30 / (c) above) on the grounds that we are protectini? our property (? against) German**inspired aggression* Effect of action would be greatly enhanced if generous releases of 'blockade 'commodities’ were immediately rushed to occupied areas. suggestions made above obviously involve immediate stoppage of all military and quasi-military (e.g. road transport) supplies with American co-operation in this respect. Equally they predicate our opposition to any plan for replacement of Germans by British or Allied technicians save only in services of wide public benefit such as irrigation or of potential value to us such as railways# 6n ( above is merely outline but we must emphasize the paramount importance of conducting vigorous and carefully devised propaganda simultaneously with application of sanctions. .Further question for consideration is whether pressure should not be applied with further object of securing internment or surrender of Arab refugees.

Moscow No. 151 Tehran No. 53. eeeeee M-VOO • Tehran telegram No. Secretary General of Ministry of Foreign Affairs to whom I mentioned this matter on July 17tn, tells me that the Turkish Ambassador, Tehran, reports the movements of practically every German. There were, he said, a certain number of Germans both entering and leaving Tehran. He had had a report from Tabriz of arrival and accommodation there of a number of Iranian (Persian) emigres from Russia. In short, there was little either to confirm or contradict the report in Tehran telegram under reference. BECd.
