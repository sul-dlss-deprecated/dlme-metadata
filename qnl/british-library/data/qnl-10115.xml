            Baron Northbrook)'s decision to cancel the Durbar and asking whether this was due
            to the apprehended famine, the fear of disease in the camp or whether his Lordship
            simply considered the limited numbers and minor status of the Chief's attending to
            be unworthy of a Durbar.The letter goes on to discuss Pelly's intention to
            continue with his own travel plans; relaying instructions from the Viceroy to the
            Political Agents; Kerowly [Karauli]'s request to be excused from attending which
            Pelly suspects may have been caused by jealousy over Kishengurh [Kishangarh]'s
            precedence.Also discussed is the ongoing matter of defining
            boundaries and the difficulties in undertaking this work when on two of the four
            assistantships are available; the need to reform the police in Rajpootana [Rājasthān] in
            order to deal with the issue of feudal barons harbouring marauders; and the difficulties
            in imposing regulations and acts on native states and how to address them.The final paragraph of the letter, which has been crossed
            through, related to personal matters including possible badminton and croquet matches
            between the two gentlemen.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876554.0x00001c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
