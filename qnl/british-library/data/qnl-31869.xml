J' Dear Anderson, x I enclose a letter for Fitzgerald, one of our Locust Officers in Arabia. It is a private letter if there is no insuperable objection I should be very gla if it could go in your bag. The foreign Office hav-e arranged for letters for our Locust Officers in Persia to go via their bags as these men have no set addresses and effective post ^ arrangements cannot be made by them privately. In these circumstances it seems not unreasonable to allow their nearest relations to forward one letter a fortnight through the official channels. We shall be very grateful if you would have no objection to this being done in the case of ^ ho ®® ° f fy ers who can be got at through the Political Agent, Bahrein. Yours sincerely, K.

I am afraid it may be a somewhat heavier package than is normally sent by fast bag but Uvarov has explained that Vesey Fitzgerald needs the books very urgently as they contain a large amount of most useful information which he will require in those parts of Arabia to which he is very shortly going. 7/e shall be very grateful for anything you can do to get these books to him by the quickest possible means.
