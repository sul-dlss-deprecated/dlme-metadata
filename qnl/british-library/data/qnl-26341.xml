W»- 0utAH ‘Extract from Kabul Intelligence Summary No. 1 for fortnight ending 4th January,1946* 9 (a) Proposed purchase of trainer aircraft. The Afghan Government have decided to buy eight secondhand Tiger Moth trainer aircraft from the Government of India, together with five years* spares.^ Supply of Aircraft to Afghanistan. The position regarding the supply of Tiger Moth aircraft to .Afghanistan appears to be 'somewhat confused since it was stated by Air H.p. India that s lx aircraft v/ere already available and were ready for collection as soon as details regarding handing over and payment had oe£n finalised, a^dstated that it had been intimated to* the Afghan Government that the purchase price would be ,1600. Having in mind the information from the Air Ministry that the cost would be 11310 I queried the figure of ‘600 and although correspondence in the relevant files between local departments was shown to quote this figure it was not possible to ascertain by whom or on what authority it was iiven. r*' v/iicA of the uncertainty as to 'whether the aircraft were actually available and the confusion re. arding the price I decided to ' follow up the question with B.A.F.S.G.A. by whom I was .nformed that as far as they were aware no aircraft had yet been made available for handing over. This appeared to be confirmed by a co y of Air Ministry signal &gt;.2323 dated 2/th December, 1945, addressed to A.C.S.E.A., which I was shown, enquiring whether eight Tiger Moths could be made available cmd i urged that an immediate decision be taicen on this question. The following A*C.S.M.A. reply was made to Air Ministry under reference 0.269 on 3rd January, 1946:- H Your X.2523 27 December. Confirm we could make available for Afghanistan Government 8 half 16 of Tiger Moths from South Africa. i5 • ' Mrom which it would appear that until such time as the 200 Tiger Moths which are being transferred from South Africa, commence to arrive in * ’ India there will be little prospect of satisfying the Afghan requirement.^ 'he opportunity v/as taken of explaining the position to the Chief Maintenance Officer, fS.Z./,., who promised to do everything po3t&gt;iDle to expedite the preparation and handing over of the aircraft as soon as instructions were received from Mir Ministry. It is recommended that Air Ministry now be asked to consider the isoiie of instructions to India that the Afghan requirements be made available from the first consignment of Tiger Moths from South Africa, or, if receipt of these is not expected at an early date, from present K., .F. holdings.COPY Ref: 3.9.(s^. AIR MINISTRY, Bush House, S.E, Aldwych, W.C.2. 2nd February, 1946 , Dear Group Captain ., yarding the question of eight Tiger Moths for sale to e *2 gaans, I am writing to let you know that A.ir Command bouth East Asia have agreed that eight aircraft can be made available from those being sent to Air Command South East Asia from South Africa. We are asking Air Command South East Asia to let us Know the details as soon as possible and will inform you of any developments. There may be still some delay due to shipping difficulties and priorities within Air Command Soutl' “,ast Asia on account of some of the first Moths being urgent] wanted to replace United States types due for handing back.

It was agreed that eight second- mvCmw /s’ r ,ban4 Moths which were still availaole in i y &lt;%/ /^^jndia could be supplied to the Afghan Government at £ 60C each. Spare parts for maintenance for 5 years could also be supplied, the total cost of which for all 8 aircraii for the whole period is / io vu, fW, / v pMtivnJ/fy Hi j/l uJsu |^k i# ^ i(oc o*} ^ AM, l^&lt; j i\,^l &amp; mi /3 -* C*%*- to U AA^W^Urvv fy\X«- ij, Uc ~f] TU^- u SEflb. pol. B£n. 1 i nrc 1 ^^^ ': /a p i A estimated at Rs.15,000 .on the basis of a monthly flying figure of 200 hours by each aircraft. This may be taken as rough guide and if more or less flying is done in one month the cost will vary roughly in proportion. The Afghan Government shoult be asked to state the estimated number of flying hours they propose to do monthly during next five years. 3. These aircraft and spare parts can now be offered to Afghan Government at the prices quoted above. It is suggested that, if the offer is accepted, six months* spares should be supplied with the aircraft and the remaining four and a half years spares should be earmarked and stored in India by the Royal Air Force to be delivered on demand. Afghans should, however, pay for whole five years' spares at once as they will be held solely on behalf of Afghan Government. The suggestion that the whole consignment of spare parts should not be delivered at once is prompted by experience of the inadequate storage facilities in Afghanistan. 4. When the order is received, these aircraft and the first lot of spares ra will be handed over to Afghan pilots at Peshawar airfield under the supervision of Headquarters No.l(Indian) Group. The Chief Instructor at Peshawar will ensure that the Afghan Pilots are properly conver sant with the type before allowing them to take off j for Kabul. Any costs of instruction or for accommodation and messing of Afghan Pilots will be for the Afghan Government to meet. 5. As there is considerable re-organisation being carried out in South Kast Asia Command at present, the Government of India would much appreciate an early decision in the matter before tnese Tiger Moths are absorbed into R.l.A.F.flying establishments.

The Afghan Govt, have not yet reached a final decision regarding the purchase of 6 to 8 Tiger Moth trainer aircraft. The accident to the Tiger Moth aircraft in Kabul last September when the propeller broke off in mid-air has been given as the reason for this lack of decision. Certain Afghan pilots apparently suspect that the Tiger Moth type of aircraft is in the habit of losing propellers in mid-air, and have made reports to the effect that the position regarding the use of tropical or ordinary propellers on this aircraft requires further investigation.To: A.M. 3«frr5Q77/Mf, of 13th Nov„ 1944c Prom: A.M.

The i.iinistry of Defence have given a hint that the accident to the Tiger iuoth on 3rd September in which the propeller broke off in mid air has led to some lack of confidence amongst officers in the Air Eorce regarding the suitability of the Tiger Hoth for service in Kabul Questions were asked about the types of propeller used with this aircraft and whether they were likely to prove efficient in Kabul. There was however no indication that the Afghan Covemment intended to postpone a decision about the proposed purchase of Tiger moth aircraft as a result of this accident, though it is probable that the Afghan authorities will ask the British pilot instructor to give a further demonstration when a new propeller arrives in Kabul. x x x x x■■■■MiI'PP /£/g AIR MINISTRY KtN G'Ch ar les 'Street, W++I T E HA trLT S.W .1 Sloane 0611 Tel.

It has therefore been suggested that we should enquire whether certain Allied or neutral countries are likely to have any requirements for Tiger Moths in the course of the next 12 months. The price of a new Tiger Moth is about £}.|00, but suitable allowance would be made for depreciation. Any requests by Allied or neutral countries for these aircraft would have to be agreed by the United States Executive on the London Munitions Assignment Board before we could authorise the supply. If you think it worthwhile, perhaps you would like to let Kabul know that these aircraft will be available if the Afghans should be interested. 2 t A, ,NDA f?

This reply was in response to an enquiry made by the Afghan Government in ‘‘kigust, 1943 , as to the availability and cost of a 'Tiger Moth' trainer. The Ministry of Defence have not so far stated whether they will accept the offer, but the Air Commandant is believed to be desirous of having a 'Tiger Moth' trainer aircraft sent to Kabul from India for trial. Owing to weather conditions in Kabul, it is unlikely that a 'Tiger Moth' could be tested out on Kabul airfields before March 15 th. The delay in reaching a decision regarding the offer of the 'Tiger Moth' is probably governed by the considerations given in sub. para.(b) above.From To .Repeated Dated OONFIDBHTIAL GODS TBLBQRAM Government of India» External Affairs Dept., His Majesty 1 s Minister at Ka*bul to Searetary of State for India.
