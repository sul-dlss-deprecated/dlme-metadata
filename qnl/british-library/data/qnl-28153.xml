SJL0/LMM/5.Extract from 'SIKD OBSKRV£R w dated 22nd March # 1949 # AHAMCO EKrIOYHES 1 GRIEVANCES Protest Against Hi^h^handedneaa (Fron our Staff Correspondent) Pakistani employees of the Arabican Anerican Oil Company who are alleged to have been victims of national arrogance, racial discrimination, religious bigotry and ruthlessness of dollar imperialism of the Americans have at last submitted today an application to the Protector of Emigrants, Karachi protesting against the highhandedness of the Americans towards the Pakistani nationals employed in the Aramco. The President of the Pakistani employees of the Aramco, Mr* Hazoor Ahmad Khan, has sent a copy of this application to the Pakistan prime Minister, Foreign Minister, I^aw and Labour Minister, United States Embassy in Pakistan and Saudi Arabian Embassy, The application runs as follows: A cursory view of American behaviour to Pakistanis is an eye opener to all freedom-loving people. Their pretences and pretexts as harbinger of peace and freedom are fully exposed and make every sensible man to realise that peace arid freedom, twin sisters of men 1 s salvation, are payed only lip-service. They maltreated us in the shape and form of disparaging utterances and bullying threats. They assigned us coolies work and even ordered us arrogantly to sweep the floor, (ft the slightest pause and hesitation in-decent language was our share i.e, »aod darn you; etc,* If we wore tongue-tied all was painfully well, A defiant attltuue or tendency to verbal retaliation would have been inevitable but self-control was our dictum, because we were aware that no outside help would be forthcoming and apparently we would be chucked out without remuneration. Dismissal a ho humiliations We put to Americans a few demands of bare necessities of life on February 27, 1949, The demands were unheeded. The days elapsed full of unxiety. The representatives wanted to meet the District Manager of the Aramco, together with other Pakistanis in connection with our demands because of our patience and perseverance were at an end. So we marched down to the District Manager's Office for demanding the reply to our Memorandum. We insisted upon them to let us go through but they were adamant and insolent. So we stood and stood until the District Manager drove to us and said sternly, *Ko granting of demands, therefore no hearing, fall back, go back you mad dogs, we know what you are etc. ,, This occurred round about 9 a.m. on March 5. At 10 a.m. they Informed us about termination of our services for no cause whatsoever, accepting that we had extended to them a few legitimate demands for bare /necessities- 2 - - necossities or lire* At 11 a*m. Anerleans summoned ua to the ofrice for rilling and signing or forms under the escort of the Security Gi*&amp;rd # There 43 Pakistanis were thrown into a tiny room and remained there for three hours with Arab policemen outside the door. On March 6th the relevant papers for otir departure were prepared and we were packed off to the Dhaliran Pier, At the Cktiop we loaded our luggage into the truck and at the Pier we off-loaded it from the truck; At the Pier, we had been lying for six hours uncared for. At 6 p.a. Americans arrived at the Pier and ordered us to re-load our luggage into the truck and go back to the camp. So had an altercation with then; in which they once again ohowed their haughtiness. Tie said to them that we would not go back to idie camp. They brought a self-styled •Amir*. However, we re-loaded our luggage and went beck to the camp. There they announced that we would go by air at 12 midnight. They posted around our camp security Guards, word not allowed to stir out. w© kept awake till 12 midnight. There was an order of the day that we would fly at 7 a.m. on March ^ th, At ^ a.m, we were despat died, to the Aerodrome under escort. There again we reluctantly unloaded our luggage. The medical examination was nominal. They did not give us any certificate oi medical examination. The consequence was that we were detained in the Isolation Hospital for three days on our landing at Karachi Aerodrome because of not possessing the Yellow F©ver Certificates. We were kept hungry for 24 hours. We were given food neither in hhahran nor at the Dhshrau Airport or on the plane, wa had cur evening moal in the Isolation Hospital at 9 p.m. on March 7th. Wo wore released from the Isolation Hospital on March 10th. *&lt;© had been resting for two days on March ll and 12, On March 13 and 14 fell holidays.’ Thus we reported to the Recruiting Agent and you on M&amp;rch 15, The statement set out auove depicts vividly what mental and physical humiliation the Americans inflicted on ua. The individual claims would folldw later through Pakistani Employees Aramco Association, mOUTWARD TELEGRAM [This telegram is of particular seer raid .pe retained by the authorised recipient and^ho't' passed on] ^ Cypher/OTP 33059/1581/91 DEPART ENTAL DISTRIBUTION becret FROk FOREIGN OFFICE TO BAHREIN No. 132 15th March, 1%9.
