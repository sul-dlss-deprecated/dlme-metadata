I visited Abu Dhabi on the 23rd June ^935* The shaikh of Abu Dhabi came on board H.JA.S.Fowey at the pre arranged time. He was extremely frightened and incapable at iirst ol coherent speech. The demeanour of Commander Harvey, and I hope myself, reassured him. He then expressed what I considered was sincere regret for his previous insulting conduct and stated that he valued highly his Treaty rights with His Majesty's Government. He assured me that there would not be any xurther or future reason for complaint against him. x x ******[ ]; Notes. Register No. Minute Paper. P. z. 4405/35. SECRET.

Please aee the note on P.Z.4044/35 regarding a report received from naval sources that action was contemplated against the Abu Dhabi pearling fleet on the grounds of the Sheikh's failure to apologise for lack of courtesy shown to the Commander of H.M.S. 'Fowey' when the ship called at Abu Dhabi in May. It will be seen from the Resident's telegrams of 12th June and 14th June at P.Z.4076/35 and P.Z.4115/35 that the naval authorities were mistaken in thinking that Colonel Fowle had addressed to the Sheikh a written demand for an apology backed by a threat of action against the pearling fleet in case of the Sheikh's non- compliance with the demand, and that the Resident refused to authorise the action proposed by the Political/Political Agent at Bahrein in order to extract an apology The Sheikh has now apologised in any case so the incident is satisfactorily closed (P.Z.4405/35) and the ^ -ujuS Resident^ report^/that the Air Force petrol store «e*ildrbe completed on 1st July.

The ShaiKh of Atu Dnati has now changed his attitude prodadly fearing that his going oack on his original agreement for tne construction of a petrol store and deacon at Adu Qhadi might lead to more serious consequences than he nau anticipated. He has now written to the Honourable the Political Resident agreeing to their construction.Please see the two telegrams below from the S.N.O., Persian Calf, and the G. in C., East Indies, to the Admiralty (P.Z. 4044/35), which show that, following a threat contained m a letter from the Political Resident to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, action against the Aba Dhabi pearling fleet was to have been taken yesterday morning, subject to consultation between the local Naval authorities and the Political Agent at Bahrein, on the grounds of the Sheikh's failure to apologise for lack of courtesy to H.r.S. 'Fowey'. The 'lack of courtesy' referred to appears to be that mentioned at the end of para. 1 of the S.N.Q.'s telegram of 18th Pay at P.Z. 3514/35, flagged. The action which now appears to be proposed by the local authorities seems to go considerably beyond the proposals made in the Resident's telegram of 26th ! ay (submitted at D .Z. 3643/35), which were approved by H.M.G. These proposals were that the Resident should be given discretion (a) to inform the Sheikh of the action which would have been taken against his pearling fleet if he had continued to obstruct the installation of a petrol store on/on the landing groand at Abu Dhabi, and (b) to take action against the pearling fleet if the Sheikh or his people showed any farther obstractiveness. The Sheikh's failare to apologise for a previous 'lack of courtesy' can hardly be counted as 'further obstructiveness'. In these circumstances, it seems desirable to ask the Resident at once for a report on the situation. ? Send.I 50) Ml3162/6823 7.34 lOOpds 200frn8 CT&amp;CoLtd Gp605/1. ^ 05/ &lt;b / MESSAGE.

The Residents express letter is self-explanatory and it is clear that this is a case of deliberate violation by the Sheikh of the spirit of the Air Agreement. In this connection please see para. 5 of Colonel Loch^ letter of 17th February at Flag B, to which reference is made by the Resident. The Air Agreement concluded with the Sheikh is at Flag A. In the circumstances explained the Resident proposes to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh by threatening to prevent his pearling fleet from proceeding to the bankSj Ctrid the Government of India have now expressed their approval of this proposal. It seems certain that an ultimatum of this kind would be immediately effective and that there would be no necessity to employ forcible measures. Subject to the concurrence of the other Departments it is submitted that Colonel Fowle’s proposals should be approved and draft letters to the F.O., Admiralty and Air Ministry are submitted accordingly. The matter is urgent since it appears that the Abu Dhabi Pearling Fleet will be putting to sea about the beginning of next month. I understand from informal conversation with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office that these Departments will probably be prepared to concur in the Residents proposals,^ fS ^ ^ 25/V3* If U+4 Iri A s', yy- r.TTe.®(g) Minute Paper. Department. 3 4 2956 6000 7/34 •°3 y. V^ ^ L r , r^ We have now traced a precedent for the action which Colonel Fowle proposes to take (viz. the collection of selected dhows from the pearling banks and the removal of their rudders and sails as a method of bringing pressure to bear on the Sheikh) which appears to be the case to 'which he refers at the end of his telegram. This was the case in 1930 when the Sheikh of has al Khaimah refused to allow a petrol barge to be moored off his Sheikhdom. (The papers are flagged in the attached bound volume.) It will be seen (P.3516/30) that on that occasion the Government of India authorised action by the Resident on their own responsibility. A full account of the development of the incident is given in Sir Hugh / Biscoe^ despatch of 23rd June, 1930, at flag 1 A 1 . The Ras al Khaimah incident is an interesting parallel, but the circumstances were not entirely similar to those of the present case. In the case of Ras al Khaimah the which action taken against the pearling fleet,/had an immediate and salutary effect upon the people of the Sheikhdom, did not at once affect the attitude of the Sheikh who was supported in his recalcitrancy by certain Bedouin from the hinterland whom he had called in. The question of whether it would be necessary to have resort to knocking down certain towers at Ras al Khaimah by gunfire was being considered (a course of action to which the Foreign Office were at that time opposed) when the Sheikh finally came to an agreement with H.M.G. It should also be noted that the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah appears to have had a much better moral case than the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi since the former had never previously given^permission for facilities for a petrol barge.3436a 5000 1.35 26 th/ 36^-5 p.z.t*?e/35. &gt; Draft Paper. r\ political Department. 30 MAY 1935 (1) U.3.3., P.O.

Reference correspondence ending with my Express Letter No. C/13 of 22nd February. Air facilities at Abd Dhabi. Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, while permitting Royal Air Force working- party to mark out landing ground has refused to permit them to build • petrol store on grounds that latter facility was not mentioned in agreement. 2. In view of paragraph 5 of Loch’s letter of 17th February I consider that Shaikh fully understood that store was-a natural adjunct to the landing ground for which he signed the agreement, and this being so if he had'had any objection to the store he should have specified this in the agreement. Furthermore Shaikh accepted payment for guards (paragraphs 3 and 4 of agreement) and obviously unless there was a store to protect there was no need for guards. Royal Air Force Officer in charge of working party put this point to Shaikh who was unable to give any satisfactory answer. (Signature) 3 . / S. 44. MFP—1013S&amp;P—-(M-1323)—30-10-33—10,000. (Designation)In these circumstances I am of opinion that the 3. Shaikh has broken the agreement and that strong measures should be taken to bring pressure on him to honour it, and to serve as a warning to other Shaikhs on Trucial Coast* necessary pressure is to interfere with the activities of the Abu Dhabi Pearling Fleet. Shaikh committed his people as well as himself to Agreement and we can enforce tribal responsibility. the Shaikh informing him that unless by a certain date he has agreed to the petrol store and beacon his pearling fleet will be prevented from proceeding to the banks. Suitable guarantees to this end which could be left to my discretion could be obtained from Shaikh or a sloop could stay at Abu Dhabi until store has been built* In the absence of the Senior Naval Officer I have discussed matter informally with Captain Fisher, Senior Officer, Persian Gulf, who is of opinion that two sloops would be able to prevent the pearling fleet putting to sea, which it does about 1st June, so if my suggestion is approved early authorisation is essential. This letter should reach you and Government of India on 20th May. to approach Shaikh and enquire into reasons for Shaikh's sudden change of attitude. 4 The most practical and easiest way to exert the 5 I propose that I should be ..authorised to address 7.

Reference paragraph No.48/iii of Intelligence Report No .6 of 1935. Flight-Lieutenant Coates of the Royal Air Force and a working party proceeded to Abu Dhabi and Sir Bani Yas Island on H.M.S.Fowey to mark the landing grounds at both places and to construct a petrol store at Abu Dhabi. On the arrival of H.M.S.Fowey at Abu Dhabi, the Shaikh failed to call on the Captain and did not cane on board until sent for and then refused to allow the construction of a petrol store on the ground that there was no specific mention of it in the Agreement which was signed in February (see paragraph No.21/2 of Intelligence Report No.3 of 1935). The Shaikh at the same time also wrote a somewhat rude letter to the Political Agent complaining that a working party had 'spoilt” his Island of Sir Bani Yas by 'surveying an area 700 yards by 600 yards'. In regard to the petrol store at Abu Dhabi, though no mention of it was made in the Agreement, the Shaikh was specifically informed by the Political Agent (Colonel Loch) that a petrol tank was one of the natural adjuncts of a landing ground and that one would be required at Abu Dhabi. This the Shaikh understood and agreed to. In the meantime the working party have completed the marking of the landing grounds at Abu Dhabi and Sir Bani Yas Island and returned to Basrah.*5.

As the result of the Resident’s telegram of 4th October the Air Ministry finally agreed to his proposal^for tne payment of a lump sum of Rs.5000 in lieu of arrears as an inducement to the Sheikh to sign an agreement. From Colonel Fowle’s express letter of 22nd February with its enclosures now attached it will be seen that the Political Agent at Bahrein has at length succeeded in obtaining from the Sheikh all the facilities required at Abu Dhabi and Yas Island on the terms authorised by the Air Ministry without any additional payment in respect of the beacons which it cd is proposed to instal 4m both places for night flying. Colonel Loch has done extremely well in obtaining these facilities from the Sheikh on the terms authorised. The Sheikh has hitherto been extremely obstinate and his pride was hurt by the installation of the Yas Island tank without his permission. It is suggested that the Secretary of State might wish to express his appreciation of Colonel Loch’s services and the Air Council will no doubt wish to associate themselves with him in doing this. Colonel Loch and the Political Resident recommend that representatives of the R.A.F. should now be sent in a sloop to select the site for the landing ground at % Abu/Abu Dhabi and carry out the necessary construction at an early date after consultation with the Political Agent. It is desirable that this should be done as soon as possible,while the atmosphere at Abu Dhabi is favourable. /4 ^ aft letter to the Air Ministry is submitted. ? r-3. 3 j /) far ' J. ^ H.AS.

With regard to paragraph 4 of my Express Letter No. 17-S, dated the 5th January 1935, I did not receive the sanction asked for, but as I considered this sanction to be in the nature of a formality I authorised Colonel Loch to proceed 'Tj* 77T’ | W ith the negotiations. 1 .' r f.tcrtj 3 # As wilijtjs seen froni Colonel Locii*s let/teFfa Cne i-ecefeSci-^ £* rf ' r \ , “■ * &gt;■ ■' 'h. , 'k 'y J* j, #1,^ Q Ai It ^ ar iU vnr air facilities have been obtained as follows: Continuance of the existing petrol tank on Yas Island.

These are the terms authorised by His Majesty's Government. 5. With regard to the beacons* Colonel Loch (vide paragraph 5 of his letter of 17th February) adopted the suggestion made in paragraph 3 of my Express Letter quoted above, and the Shaikh did not demand anything extra for their installation, though (as will be seen from paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch's letter of 17th February) he expected better terms than he was finally persuaded to accept. 6 . I endorse the recommendations made by Colonel Loch in paragraph 6 of his letter of 17th February, modified by paragraph 2 of his letter of 20th February, for the action now to be taken by the Royal Air Force. 7. To sum up. We have obtained the facilities which we wanted and the Shaikh is now on more friendly terms than he has been for some years past. This is all the more satisfactory in view of the key position held by the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi in the Trucial Coast hinterland. 8 ® Having regard to the previous obstinate attitude of the Shaikh, and the difficulties which had to be overcome in inducing him to adopt a more reasonable frame of mind, I consider that Colonel Loch, in bringing these long drawn out negotiations to a successful conclusion, has done excellent work. I fully concur with Colonel Loch's remarks in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his letter of 17th February as to the assistance /assistance given him by Saiyid Abdur Razzaq, and as to the hospitality and help rendered by the Commander of H.M.S.

Sir In continuation of my telegrasi dated the 14th February 1935 I have the honour to report that I proceeded to /bu Dhabi in H,M.S Po'eey arriving there on the 6 th February afternoon* Calls were exchanged on the 8 th and 1 th February, but heavy weather caused considerable difficulty in lending and coining off. ?. The Residency Agent, *ho&amp; I had surnroned to Bahrein, vas too ill to accompany mo to Abu Dhobi, but, as he is unlikely to be v;e*ll for some time, I decided, though not without hesitation, tp proceed with the negotiations isyself. 4. I so arranged natters that the business of the sir facilities was broached by the Shaikh's relatives anc not by me. I will spare yon the detrlls of the tedious end confused Discussions which ensued. The Shaikh and his relatives had the f :r.n belief that the agreement Grade by the Residency /gent and Shaikh Sg'id bin Maktua of blbai (see the fourth paragraph of ay /l ypre ss/ Express -better ^o:C/921-7/2 dated the 18th December H&gt;^4) ^;as in force. I did not wish to upset Shaikh Sa , id, ^ho had been very helpful, by disowning his work} but at the same time it *&amp;s impossible for me to admit the validity of his settlement, which involved a payment of tis.400/~ a laonth for the tank at Sir Bani Yts Island alone. They, moreover, considered themselves entitled to arrears of the payment since the tank was placed on the island four years ago. I found out afterwards that they had expected a further monthly payment and also more than double the lump sum (Hs.5,000/-) vnich I had been authorized to give. Slielkh bhakhbut bin bultan end his uncle. Shaikh Khalifeh, were, however, very friendly, and since our adventures looking for water their ( attitude has been completely differ at to that of the past. It was, nevertheless, no easy matter to persuade them to accept, for the terms which we offered, a new agreement in place of Shaikh ie’id’s and to include the additional facilities of a landing ground at Abu hhabi f th &amp; tan ,nition of t IjMMltni ground at Sir Bani Yas Island end e light therej. Finally, they did so, partly on the ground of personal friendship end partly on the ground of pride, for Shaikh Shakhbut has an almost Celtic price to vhlch it proved possible to appeal. 5. I enclose a copy (with a translation) of the Agreement which was sealed and signed on the night of the 13th February 1 'if 5 . It will be seen that there is no specific mention of the lights or oi the tank on the Abu Dhabi landing ground, as in accordance with the instructions in your Express better 8 o 2 i 7 -S dated tne 5 th ^^ttUary I treated them as the usual adjuncts of a landing ground. Ihe need for them on the landing ground was, however, /carefullyIt ¥&gt;&amp;&amp; also axpl&amp;ined that the sa;^e adjuncts would be required nn the landing ground at Sir Banl Yas Island• 6 . The exact position of the landing ground at Abu Ihabi is not stated, but it was explained tnat it v.aula be 'outside the town' three or four mites sway. I recommend that representatives of the Royal Air Force should be sent in one of His Majesty** Ships to select the site and carry out construction as s 'on as possible and that Flight-Lieutenant K.H.Coates should Lccomizny them, £3 the Shaikh is already personally acquainted with him. I would also recommend that, if possible, sufficient material and workmen be taken to enable the .hoie operation to be completed at one time, and that, in any case, the markings, light and tank be installed on the Abu Ihabi lancing ground ;if the works csnnot be done simultaneously) before the lamp is put up at Sir Banl Yes Island, so that no opportunity may be afforded to mischief makers to misrepresent the lamp et bir B&amp;ni Yes Island and so cause difficulties over putting one up at Abu Dhabi. I would emphasise that we arc dealing with a very suspicious, excitable and illogical people and that It would, therefore, be prudent to think out details about material, labour and so on with great cere Deforehand so that there may not be delays on the spot when the time comes to install the facilities. I would suggest that the Ofileers of the Royal Air Force concerned might discuss plans with me at an early date. 7. I handed to the Shaikh, in the presence of his relations, the lump sum of Hs.5,000/-, and also, once the business was finished, suitable personal gifts. I propose to pay, through the Residency Agent, the sum of Hs.400/- each month with effect from /thethe ISth February 1335, the date of the Agreement In the same way that payment is made for the Sharjah facilities* 8. I should like to bring to your notice the excellent work done by rry Head Munshi, Saiyid ’ Abdul R&amp;zzac, who was of much help to me both during the negotiations and in getting into Indirect touch with a certain influential individual* 2. I hope that an expression of my thanks may be conveyed to Commander E.H.N*Harvey for his kind hospitality and help. Weather conditions were unfavourable, and getting on shore and back involved heav 3 r pulling and on one occasion it was necessary for the Chip to proceed a short distance to sea as a precaution against the high wind. 10. I am particularly glad to be able to report this happy ending of the tank controversy as our friendship, or the reverse, with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi may well have far reaching effects in view of his position in the hinterland of the Iruciai Coast from Qatar on the west to Baraimi on the east.

The Residency Agent was* much upset at the idea of further barga r ing over the payment, because it would reflect on Shaikh Sa*id and of course himcelf (though naturally they had no authority to e ?«uuit «.n*v«rj **». ). iho business is unar*ti factory, but X nope that now tnat i have made friend® with Shaikh thakhfeut and Shaikh Khalifah, it will be possible to get round it once negotiatione re-open. He t ;in ; # that once the la® island tarns bueineeo is settled, Shaikh Shekhbut i« lixcly to give the Abu hat i landing f round (owing to the illnees of the Residency gent and dhaikh Sa’id this cueetion h«® not yet been broached to him) without further payment. 1 do not almre this view, though it ia &gt;cs»ible, with a queer character lJKe Shakh ilhakhbut, that the Residency Agent may be right. 5. 1 fe*r that if we come to an agreement over Y^e Island and for a landing ground at Abu Dhabi with &gt;ha kh Jhakhbut and then proceed to erect beacons, we shall only heve the weary business of the tank over again. Moreover, Shaikh ^ihakhbut is certain, when we nerotiwte, to ask whether anything more is wanted - 1 ahall them either have to say 'Yee, beacons*, in w ioh r^ae 1 shall be deeply©mburrftsoed and aha,11 hava to forfeit the confidence which 1 hope th*t 1 have won, or I ehnll have to 'Ko** and appenr in an even worse li^ht later on. Although it may be poseible to persuade him that a beacon (like the revolving li^ht at Sharjah) i» a reasonable and natural concomitant of a landing ground (though he, like ourselves, has always been assured that emergency landing grounds only are wanted^, he^will, I think, regard it as a special facility. I would, of course, press the navigation argument, but I doubt if it will carry much weight. 6. I apologise for this lengthy explanation of the ^position. For future action, I would suggest that 1 summon the Residency Agent to Bahrain as soon as possible after Rwnadhan and go into the matter with him. By own view as to tactics is to explain to the Residency Agent exactly what is wanted, emphasising that our needs have changed since he and Shaikh Sa'id went to Abu Dhabi. I would then send him ahead of me to Abu Dhabi with a substantial sum (say Rs.2,000/-) to be used if the situation so develops, as earnest money, (with a view to acknowledging Shaikh Shakhbut’s acceptance of the principle of a tank Pnd to paving the way for our fuller requirements. This will, I think, have a persuasive effect on Shaikh Shakhbut and his uncle, Shaikh Khalifah (who wields much influence'. I should then like to be in a position to follow the Residency Agent in a Sloop. 7. I would, however, urge that I be given discretion to • pend up to the extra Itiup sum of Re.7,COO,/ - * and a monthly sum of R«.200/- mentioned in par-graph 2 of my telegram dated the 5th December. 1 will try to avoid this additional expenditure, but I particularly do not wish to hr-ve any delay in referring to Government once the negotiations have been resumed. 8. 1 should like to be as'*ured that the beacons will be placed on the landing grounds (see paragraph 5 of your telegram) and also that these beacons sre indeed the laet facility requir for Abu Dhabi (1 hear a rumour of a beacon being wanted at Hai«immliilant! ** well). I oppreeinte th»t it is impoaiiible to call finality to the requirementf of «o rapidly advancing a science nn aerial nayigation, but I hope that it will be possible, once these facilitiee are obtained, to avoid asking for eomethim?: rr,ore, till the Shaikh hne had a rea«onaol&lt; time to become familiar with these new idea*. 9. It would be very useful if I might have the photographa of a beacon asked for in paragraph 3 of my telegram of December hth. (Sgd.) G.Loch.

They consist, at Yas, of the maintenance of a storage tank, an emergency landing ground and flying boat anchorage, and at Abu Dhabi, an emergency landing ground and probably permission to build a store house. These requirements have, of course, already been agreed to by the local Political and Air Force authorities in the Gulf.

Following is note of my conversation (as Political Bahrain) with Shaikh of Abu Dhabi regarding the to the tank:- 'I took the matter up with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on my return visit to him on the morning of the 30th June and informed him of the contents of the tele gram. I asked him to send a representative with a representative of the Residency Agent(who was present) to make enquiries. The Shaikh replied (perfectly politely) that it was his Island, that Government had put the tank there without his consent and against his wishes, that he declined to accept any responsibility and that he would not send anyone to help in making enquiries. He added that he did not wish to enter into any discussion about the tank, till after it had been removed. I pointed out the advantages that Abu Dhabi gained from the Government, peace at sea for their pearling boats, ease in getting their supplies from the steamers at Dibai and help on their journeys to India and elsewhere, and said that the tank was a small/• 2 - small matter and not like a Rest House and establishment such as had been made at Sharjah* I did not feel justified in going so far as to threaten that these advantages might not continue, but the inference is an easy one. The Shaikh, while admitting the advantages, remained adamant. In the course of the conversation he emphasised that he had not complained or made trouble like the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, but that it was not just of Government (who had of course power to overwhelm him) to have placed the tank there in spite of his wishes, that people thought that the Island was no longer his, and that he awaited justice from us”. 2. At Bahrain I consulted Shaikh Hamad bin ‘Isa, who is wise in Arab matters, and he and his son advised that we should get Shaikh Sa*id bin Maktum of Dibai to act as an intermediary. 3. At Bushire I discussed the question with Colonel Fowle, and we instructed the Residency Agent to ask Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum to accompany him to Abu Dhabi and verbally to persuade the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to accept the tank and establish guards on Yas Island* The following line was to be taken '(a) Shaikh of Abu Dhabi cannot divest himself of responsibility for damage to British Government property within his territory since all Rulers are responsible for security and since he actually at one time sent guards there with Residency Agent and after that has been dis cussing question of pay of guards with Residency Agent. (b)/mm -3- mmrnrnmmmtmmm Cb) If Shaikh will not place guards there I (Political Resident) will do so, which will adversely affect his prestige. (&lt;r) On the other hand, if Shaikh agrees to provide guards I (political Resident) will bear cost of making guard house near tank and of flagstaff on which he can fly his flag, which will increase his prestige.'* 4. This was done and the Political Agent, Bahrain, has telegraphed the gist of the Residency Agent's report (I have not yet received the full report owing to my absence in Tehran)• It is proposed that an agreement for the tank should run for twelve years from the date of installation of the tank and that the Shaikh should receive Rs.400/- (four hundred rupees) a month. The Shaikh asks for payment from the date of installation. The Shaikh says that his earlier refusal was the due to bad advice from certain Persians and Arabs. 5 . The position, therefore, is that the Shaikh is now prepared to accppt the tank and to provide guards, but that he asks for Rs.400/- a month. The Shaikh is likely to be adamant on the subject of the amount, because he is a young man of some character and because, as he invariably emphasises, the tank was installed in spite of his written objections. 6* I am averse from trying to obtain a reduction of the amount by using pressure or force, as (apart from other considerations) it would show us in an unfavourable light along the Arab Littoral and confirm the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in his rancour. 7 . The alternative of putting our own guards on Yas Island would be expensive and unsatisfactory for political reasons. It would also destroy any hope of arranging amicably/-4- amicably an emergency landing ground and tank near Abu Dhabi. 8. It is possible,however,that the Shaikh might be persuaded for Rs.400/- a month to agree to Mu emergency landing ground with a tank near Abu Dhabi as well as that at Yas Island. 9. If this can be arranged it would, I think, afford a reasonable solution of our difficulties with the Shaifch, especially as rationing and watering guards at Yas Island will be a troublesome and expensive business. 10. If you agree, I should like to have authority as soon as possible to try to conclude the arrangement suggest ed in paragraph 8. It would be as well to obtain the authority by telegram as long delay may give an opportunity to the Shaikh’s relations and others to make trouble. 11* The Political Agent, Bahrain, does not recommend the payment from the date of installation of the tank. I agree, and hope that I may be able to come to some arrangement with the Shaikh over this point. 12, In arranging for a tank near Abu Dhabi, it would probably be easier to obtain the Shaikh's consent, if it were possible to install a tank flush with the ground and so strong that a permanent guard post would not be required• Is this feasible ? sd.

There is, I fear, little question that Colonel Loch is right in thinking that if ana when the idea gets about tuat we are negotiating about the ninterlana with Urn Saud the difficulty of securing air facilitie s along the coast will be substantially increased. In all the circumstances we think there Is much to be saia for the acceptance of tae recommendation contained in paragraph 6 of his telegram. The amount involved is not very large ana it seems well worth our while to clinch this matter while conditions are favourable. would you be so kinu as to let me Know whether tne Air ministry agree ana whether we may give the necessary authority to the Hesident?

Reference Intelligence Report for / July 1934, pa.ras.10 ana 11, the Honourable the Political Resident has not yet confirmed the settlement obtained. He hopes to include an emergency landing ground and petrol tank near h-bu Dnabi as well as that at Yas Island for the Rupees 4QQ per mensem, a further point at issue is the Shaikh* s demand that payment should commence from the date of installation of the Yas Island tank. It appears reasonable that he shoulcereceive some payment as Yas Island has been used, but not the full Rupees 400, as he has not hitherto provided a guard.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000210_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1990</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000210</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1990</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/36 ‘Persian Gulf Air Route: Air facilities at Yas Island and at Abu Dhabi’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T01:05:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (116 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 117; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

A copy of the agreement reached (in both Arabic and English) can be found on folios 83-84.Following the conclusion of the agreement, the file documents the Shaikh's subsequent refusal to permit the construction of a fuel storage tank near Abu Dhabi and his ‘discourtesy’ towards the Commander of HMS
