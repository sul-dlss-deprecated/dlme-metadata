It is published in Berlin with apparently the sole object of fostering hatred of the Bnglish. They have recently been sending free copies around the (Julf to advertise the paper and get Agents. You will see from the outside cover that they have succeeded in establishing Agencies in Bahrain # and Lingeh. It has been taken up her# with avidity and I am informed several persons in Qatar and Najd are already subsribers. It is printed in Persian,Arabic and Hindustani and is of the 'Blood and thunder 1 order which appeals s V ' # to the ignorant population of these localities. I gatflcher from one of the articles in the paper that it has been forbidden in India. Would it not be possible to censor and remove from the Post wak in the Gulf, such Journals as this and f Al Aichbar 1 which can do a vast amount of harm? It is somewhat Ironical that these invectives ag4iins' the British should be introduced into these parts by means of the Post Office which we run for the benifit of the inhabitants. I have frequently been advised by well wishers of Government here, •to take stops to stop importation of such publications. Our failure to do co is regarded in some quarters as a sign of weakness,and ther is little doubt that such a paper which appeals continually to the religioua scruples,vide the article about the 'drunken iinglish Priest 1 helps^to increase the anti-British wave which is becoming increasingly felt at any rate on this side of the Gulf.

The Porsian Govern: lent or rtaanljr has not desired to '-no T .7 what, vrhoi^e' and in what condition la Bahrain, If it had wanted to know and understand, it would have •undoubtedly be thought itself of giving some confort to the unfortunate inhabitants of this region, who consider thenselves Persians, _nd hope for the clemency of the Persian Governnent. 1- Bahrain is one of the ancient possessions of Persia, contains 363 considerable villages and two large towns ruharraq and : ananeh, and has 80,000 inhabitants# 2- Bahrain is altogether without any Persian Governor Karguzar, Pestoffice, Finance gency and ' ilitary Perce• 3- Any traveller wishing to go fron Bushire to Bahrain is like travellers fron one place to another in the interior of Persia; but any traveller wanting to' leave Bahrain for sonewhere else nust have a British pass-norl and they deal with him as if in a British colony# 4- Let it not be thought that the Resident or British Agent interferes directly in affairs. No. ^hey do not require to do so, r -s there is a Persian nglophile, worse than any foreigner in Bahrain, who works for the British better than they do themselves. This in uhamnad Sharif 'Awazi, who on behalf of the Political Agent is in charge of the Police and uni- cip-lity, and who has the title of 'han Bahadur Sahibe 5-t From rear of his intrigue and plots thn inhabitants of Bahrain do not dare to breathe, or s:y they are alive. For they have seen how a certain Abdulla Bastaki by his intrigue died undnr the bastinado of the Political Agent o.nd then how •nohammad Jawad and Abdun -abi Bushire and the rest of them made out an affidavit th tthat Abdullah diod a natural death. They have seen how Aoadullah J ami, for the crine of 'being a denocrat, has been 4 nonths in prison and no one dares to ro near hinu They have seen how a certain Karbalai Ghulam A.li had fled fron the' tyranny of these nen r and orders were given to plunder his house and auction his effects, anc 1 hov; these nen thoinselves bought then up. They have seen how Tabaruni, a razaruni lerchant for the crine of patriotism and writing a petition : 0 or a poor on-pressed woman was ^ut in Jail, and with great difficulty was freed by Sheikh Khalaf the Qazi, who is another of the frinnds of those men. 1 uhammad Sharif, without my apprehension is trans porting to and from foreign ports all those n:oods which legally are contra/band. By these proceedings + hey want to say that Bahrain is not part of Persia, but foreign territory• Have the Persian Governrent nev^r thought, or the Deputies in Parliament never as 1 'ec' why there is no Karguzarate in Bahrain, and why letters in Bahrain are stamped with foreign sta ns, and what is the difference between Bahrain, and Sunder AbVas or -i-dngeh? Do they 1-now tha.t the ^arguzar of Bushire has visited 11 places in the ports and co sts of Persia, but does not land at Bahrain, and considers it rn impertinence to do so, as being outside his snhere of duties? Shni] h Isa, the Governor of Bahrain who fcr long has been a rebel against the Persian Government now r-grets it, and understands that he has made a mistake. VJhy do not the ^overnr ent win him over by a title, or robe of honour or ar ord^r, which in Persia are auctioned so froel\^; and why do they not give him an official position so that gradually foreign influence may be undermined? n hy is not a Persian flag hoisted here' if it is1 is hoistod why does Sharif 'Awazi haul it dot Tho rest of ny evidence I will write at 1 enrt^^^hr^ traveller'• M'X &gt;■ ——• ••••••• in the intornational wo.r the -^ritiGh. chose 'uhan- nad Sharif a« a spy In Bahrain and he willingly made his position mown, and fo this service was given the title of k han Sahib, Afterwards ho strove so hard that c.s a result of the killing of uhannad Abdullah Bastaki he obtained tne title of han Bahadur. During the ti ip of his spying he has refrained fron no sort of oppression, nd i] -treated the pecnle of Bahrain 3.s r uch as he could • ••••• if anyone spo':o ill of tno British ho ''.3 immedia tely deportee Per the ^ast D years they have been thinking of dividing Bahrain between the Arabs and the I ritishj and if this is so, little by ittle Bahrain will fall into the hands of the British. 20 years a-o ^ conflict arose between the Arabs ^nd Persians in Bahrain, ^he Arab governor wanted to seize the Persians; but when the latter realized this they took refuge with the British Consul, Afterwards agreements were made between the Persians and the Consul ^nd the Arabs, by Trhich the Consul became the Protector and Governor of all foreign subjects, ^efore this o curronce Perilaa* and otfeer nationals were un-i.^r the ordrrs ^f the Arabs. Up till now the British Consul has been the Protector of the Persians, as Persia had always benn a despotic Government; but now why should the British be the Pro tectors of - -rsians, seeing that they act as they please in Bahrain, - Itbget. er British subjects in Bahrain number 500 to 4^0. Thny have - protector so that no onn can -o- lest ther. But the unfortunate Persians resident in Bahrain number about 12,000 and without any Consul or protector are und r the oppression of the British, and the Khan Bahadur, T nIn truth, if Bahrain is -oart of Persia, a Governor appoin eel for Bahrain? if it is foreign territory, why is there no Persian Consul to save the Porsi ns fron British oppression? We beg the ministry of the Interior to make sone arrangement O or Bahrain, and free these nnfortunate subjects from oppression.. ho ' The gancj, Behraln t Peraifiii QrJf. 29/10/22.

THK PLIGHFOF BAHRAIN. o the Editor of 'xlie Chronicle ,, . Sir, lie people of Bahrain have all along been consoling themselves by a belief that ttie superior British authorities on being acquainted with the details of the aggressions perpetrated against the people and encroachment made on their liberty, would not approve of such a policy; while in fact, it is to be regretted that the above belief is now being shunned by degrees owing to some one of the three presumptions viz; - (l) ihat either the British Govomment have directed and are aware cf the course of policy pursued in their country, ignorant of the fact that it would tend to convert the anxiety find fright of die people into desperation when they ha\^e lost every hope of attaining justice and equity. (2; rhat the British Government relies on the Consult reports, believing the petitions of the people contradicting the former*s reports. If it is so, then at least it betrays negligence on the part of the British Governmait with regard to investigating for justice in spite of the people of Bahrain having requisitioned the Government to depute an unbiased Commission to enquire into the grievances of the people of Bahrain . (3) 'liat the British Government intend and mean to hold an enquiry into the affairs at Bahrain but pending enquiry have not asked the Consuls at the Persian Gulf to put a stop to their despotic policy, which is the worst of the three. Whereas we on our part have been awaiting the result though our patience has now betrayed us. While.Vhlle we were expecting a change In the policy which has clearly manifested itself to have marred the prestige and renown of Great Britain in the Ba»tem Verrit- -ories of the Arabian Peninsula, lo we see Hajor Delly (Daly) adopting fresh ways of aggression, evincing further stupid- -ity by further proving himself to be the sole creator of the galling miseries for Arabs in their own country. 3o he has forced conscript labour on the helpless natives of Bahrain driving them like cattle and subjecting them to hard labour at w Ard n , announcing that he wanted to erect there a station for airships. has transgressed the bounds of law, indeed. ^outtesy is unknown to him. He did not even ask Shaikh Isa, Chief of Bahrain, for his consent be- -fore putting his scheme for erecting the said station into effect. ^urther^i he has announced to have fixed a heavy tax on all boats regardless of their being the pearl-fishing farar iric ones or otherwise having changed their numbers into English figures which the natives are not expected to make out. Ji ^he most horrible act of his is that he has reducet the members of the Ruling Chief's family to the state of confinees in Bahrain; for when most of them asked for permit to enable them to go abroad on medical grounds or some such other urgent reasons the same was denied to them. Lately he seems to have been much perturbed on reading articles In newspapers criticising the course of policy pursued in Bahra and attempted consequently to cause some respectable family members of the Huling Chief by force to repudiate the said articles as fAlse through newspapers, but in vain; for the latter evon at the risk of exposing themselves to his reveng on them, denied to agree with his request. It is likely that some of them ultimately ma/ yield under his threats and helplessly may attest a false statement he may dictate to them.We heard coxae time ago that the people of Bahrain with their Chief Shaikh Isa at their head had submitted their grievanoee to the Viceroy of India, nhich report is now confirmed by what conversation we had with some respect- -able men of Bahrain and they were very anxiously awaitAAg a reply to the said representation hazarding their conjectures simultaneously in various ways. ^ We cannot but suggest to the benign British Government that the investigations into the affairs of Bahrain should not terminate in asking report from the antagonists only, when it is evident that they, possessing powers, can with threats and inducements, rally false witnesses who may give evidence innocently with good intentions in their own opinions. ^or this only reason we entreat the Government to investigate into the case of Bahrain directly and under their immediate supervision . TOiat a crucification of justice and humanity would it be should the Government, owing to their other encumberances, postpone the trial of the case of the helpless, melancholy and persecuted people of Bahrain indefinitely; Bahrain today is rolling in the lowest abyss of misery and disdain, awaiting rescue at the hands of the wisest judge. His ^xcell- -ency Lord 'Reading , the Viceroy of India. Will he dis- -appoint them ? Most probably not; but if he did, which God forbid: and Bahrain became the soene of action of the helpless desperates, then very likely it will be said that the people of Bahrain were fanatics and Jntolerant towards the people following other religions. We do not intend here to repeat our obligations done to Gre4t Britain by our treatment of h4r in season and out of season for we do not seek for a favour in return; nay we ask for justice and justice only. We/ ask helto treat us according to the pledge she herself had drafted and approved of. WeWe are aware that some individuals of the minor 'Shiaa' 1 community at Bahrain have abandoned their self- selfish -respect and are seeking after their fsmjddrii motives • Hencp Major Belly (Daly) can easily make them too&amp;s In getting statements written by them as may satisfy his desire. But will the lovers of justice esteem It chivalrous and honorable to take advantage of such a religious discord ? By God, stooping to such Ignoble measures is a stigma on the forehead of humanity and a stain of disgrace on the face of civilization. Yours, etc. 'L'.The Agency CQKFIDESTIAL Nol 1 ^/ $ /II .

I recently ot a telegr- m from C-f zdc r sayin^ th^t the Shaikh of Bahrain had seen an announcement in an 'Iraq pa^er tc the effect that it was prohabl#. that the Residency would shortly e transferred to Bahrain, and p .elgraYe had written in officially asking if this was correct, and hinting that the Shaikh was somewhat surprised that he had not 'been consulted, etc. As you know the question has 'been under consideration for nearly two years and His Tajesty's Government had author ised Minister to put it forward as the last card to he played in the negotiations* The negotiations have dragged on ever since in a more..and more unsatisfactory form and Sir Robert Clive did not therefore mention the matter to the Persian Government, and finally last month he informed the Persian Government that as they evidently did not mean 'business and their proposals were entirely unacceptable to His Majesty's Government he did not propose to postpone his leave any longer and the negotiations must now be regarded as at an end, and' he asked for a farewell interview with the Shah. I therefore concluded that there was no likelihood of the Residency being-2- beinp- 'transferred in ttie near fut/ure at any rate, and instructed Gazdar to inform tiie S^iaikli tlia•- •• • - - repcrt wvao unfounded. oweverj apparently Clive*s uXtimatum as 'brought the Persians to their senses more or less, negotiations have 'been re-opened and the transfer of the Residency has now- been offered to the Persians as a final make-weight, I have therefore wired for permission to inform the Shaikh of Bahrain and obtain his acquiescence to the location of the Residency at Bahrain. This sudden change in the situation however has put me in a very difficult position for though, as you will perceive, my denial of the report was sent in all good faith it will 'be very difficult to make the Shaikh realise it. I think the best thing would 'be for you to try and see Shaikh Hamed as soon as you get 'back and in the course of conversation explain to him that the question of the transfer of the Residency has Veen under consideration for the last two years, 'but that no definite decision has 'been arrived at in the matter and until a decision has 'been arrived at I saw no necessity for mentioning the matter to him; 'but si.ee he has raised it, 1 have asked you to let him know confidentially that it under consideration and of course should it be decided upon and should it be consider ed desirable to locate it at Bahrain, he will, of course, be informed at once and his concurrence sought, I leave you of course to put it into suitable phraseology but if you could ]et him know that the thing is in the air.but that as no decision had been arrived at I could not admit the accuracy of the newspaper report, it woulr pave the way for me and, if His Majesty's Government agreed to my informinginforming the Shaikh, I could do so when I visit Bahrain as to the apparent change of heart of the Persians and feel 'by no means certain that the Residency ever will 'be transfer- red; anyhow I fancy we shall know very shortly for if Minister does not come to terms v/ith them now negotiations will undoubtedly 'be definitely 'broken off. early in 'Movember. Personally, I am still slightly scepticalConfidential. D.O.No.562-3 of 1950. / N^' British. Residency, Bushire, the 13th October 1930. /■Caw m^rr P Please refer to n^'- demi-official letter No.533-S, dated 3rd October 1930, regarding the transfer of the Residency. Since I wrote that, further changes have occurred at Teheran and negotiations are apparently now being definitely broken off. The question of the transfer of the Residency is therefore again in abeyance. I am however getting somewhat wearied of being a pawn in the prolonged and futile negotiations. I have therefore sent a wire today asking whether His Majesty's Government propose to transfer the Residency or not, and pointing out that as the matter had been reopened it was highly probable that the Persians would redouble their pinpricks and try and make the Resident's position impossible. I therefore urged that His Majesty's Government should either show the Persians that we are not wholly devoid of means of retaliation or that they should agree to the transfer of the Residency without any quid pro quo, but should stipulate for the maintenance of the status quo until it goes. What the reply will be I do not know but I still think it wo ul jbe as well if you spoke to Shaikh Hamad in the sense that I indicated in my previous letter on this subject and told him that the matter .. Gapt. C.G.Prior,1 # A., Political Agent, Bahrain.-2- matter had been considered on and off for the last two years and that no decision had been come to. upon. I have 'been considering how we could retaliate on the Persians, and one thing that has occurred to me is to abolish the privileged position of Persian subjects in Bahrain and make them subject to the jurisdiction of the Bahrain courts. I am sure the Persians would not like this and I also think that the threat would suffice and that it would not be necessary to put it into execution# ^n the other hand suppose it were necessary to put it into execution, do you think there would be any practical difficulties in the way? In view of the fact that the Persians deny our special position in Bahrain I do not see how they could possibly contend that their subjects should be tried by the xoli^ical Agent and not by the Bahrain courts. Secondly, they have abolished capitulations in their own country and I see no reason why the Shaikh of Bahrain should not abolish capitula tions in his territory as far as Persian subjects are con cerned. Thirdly, Bahrain courts are presumably no worse than the Persian courts.

As regards making the Persians subject to Bah- TVo rain courts, I see ps objection to your using this as a threat but the results would be much more serious for ourselves than the Persians as trouble would inevitably ensue. In the first place, Belgrade has not a second to spare, and you would have whole to give him a second xii time mugistrate, who would have to be an Indian or En lishman vho knwte Persia^to do the work.

Their cases are often very complicated, anr no one in the Bahrain Coi rt knows -ny law constant references to the /gency would arise, even more than exist at present. The ersians are accustomed to ■ high standard of ifrork and woulc resent the home methods of the L hr lin Court. hen I came the community were somewhat out of hand, but our relations are of the best now, and it would be a poor reward for their coopera tion to hand them over to the Bahrain Government. * \ A more serious objection is that if they were haad- ed over, thp* Q,usaibis would im ediately press bin Saud to re- colnider his request thet we should protect their Interests, v and as he ^usaibis are all powerful. Has aw is and Nejdis would do as they liked and no one w uld say them nay. In fact the whole present system would collapse. I see, however, no reason why the threat should nou be used, and if your bluff was called authorise the Bah rain Government to issue warrants in cases where Persians werepa 0 e 2» involved, in other words give up their inviolability of domi- cile, and this would not injure our position anr yet seem* a great loss to them.

Please refer to the correspondence ending with your demi official letter 562-S dated the loth October 1930. I will explain matters to the Shaikh when an oppor tunity occur , but it will be difficult to get him to carry away the correct impression. I .see no objection to threatening the Persians with the loss of their priviled^ed position in Bahrain, but if the threat were put into execution the consequences would be more serious for us than lor them, End we should be cutting off our noses to spite the Persians f face f • In the first place, Belgrave has not a second to spare and as neither he or Prke nor any Al Khalifa know a word of Persian it would be necessary to find them a whole time magistrate, who would have to be either an Englishman or an Inaian to dothe work. For reasons unknown to me, Belgrave, who is a very sound on most subjects, detests all Persians and I doubt if he could deal with them impartially. When I was new to Bahrain, I found his advice regarding the Persians quite unreliable and I invariably regretted having takeh it. Iheir cases are oiten very complicated, ( you will have noticed the bankruptcy of Muhammad Sharif ) and as the Bahrain Court are sublimely ignorant of all formi of law, save lor a smattering ol the Shara'a, the Agency would be bothered by oven more references than they are now. The Persians are the most intelligent section of the Bahrain public, and are accustomed to a high standard of work and would raise a clamour if subjected to the arbitrary methods of The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel H.V.Biscoe, I.A«, Political Resiaent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. &lt;of the Bahrain Court. I doubt if the constant appeals to Persia that would ensue would benefit us, and it would only mean that Bahrain would be constantly before the Persian public. When I came, the Persian community were decidely out of hand, but our relations are now of the best ( the leading malcontents borrowed two of my ponies for the Muharrum pro cession I ) and it would a pity to disturb them. It must also be remembered that in times gone by they nave materially aided us in consolidating our position and whatever their fellow countrymen in Persia have done^ local Persians Lave a claim on us. A far more serious objection is that once Persia^ W were handed back, we could not justify a refusal to hand ove^ the Nejdis and Hasawis also. Our claim to protect them rests on Bin Saud's request, and the ^usaibis would very soon poini^ out to them what Kas to be gained by a return to the Bahrain Government. The Qusaibis are all powerful and when, as you have seen, their hangers on do not hesitate to assault ana imprison the Al Khalifa T s own servants, you can imagine how long Belgrave and the Bahrain Court would stand up to them. One must constantly bear in mind that Belgrave is in a very difficult position, that he holds his post at three months * notice, and that if he ceased to be a persona grata with the Shaikh it would be difficult to force his services on him. In fact, all the wok of the last seven years would be in the melting pot.

I //ill deal with the statements seriatim, 2. Soon after my arrival I received visits from Areb merchants, Hindu nerch nts and Persian merchants. T did not make to the latter any statement to the effect that those who f or more than 30 : c• irs had lived in ahrtin were in accordance with the rules in force considered to be Bahrain subjects. The interviews lasted about a quarter of an hoi r in each case and to the -est of my recollection the conversation was confined to the usu-1 polite enquiries about the state of trade, etc. 3. The next statement is to the effect that I inspected the Government departments in Bahrain on the 29th October and gave orders for the dismissal of the Persian staff. Firstly, I was not in Bahrain on the 29th October; I ... ■'.B.r* s Charge d* Affaires , British Legation, Tehran.I prrived there on the 8th N. vember and left on the 11th !

I gave no orders of any k. d that any Persian should be dismissed from any departments The whole story is a complete and entire fabrication from beginning to end, 4, I did not have a 1on_ private conversation with a Persian Mujtahid called Shaikh Aya. Several of the local priecthood called upon me and it is possible that Shaikh /.ya ray have been amo v ;_ them. I saw a very large number of people and do n^t remember their names. In view of the fact however that 1 was exceedingly busy, each interview was limited to about a. quarter of an hour and conversation was confined to the customary platitudes. The only interview that I can recall with any of the kazis was one with the chief Shia ka^i, who complained for 'he second time to me of the oppression suffered y his compatriots at LTohammerah at the hands of the Persxan authorities. 5. It seems hardly necessary to discuss the article in the 'Itilf 'at' 1 . It is a series of l^es from beginning to end. I have only been able to discover one accurate statement in it, and that is, that the quarantine building has been acquired by the Roy^l Air Force as a rest house. Every other f: t tement -ade in that article is untrue except, of cc rse, the fact that, as stated above, I did sec some of the ka^is and Shaikh Ali ( presumably this is the same man as is ref erred ..•referred to as Shaikh Aya by the Ministry for foreign Affaire) may have been among them. ^o '/xsit, hov/ever 1 -• c.&lt; ^lace in secrecy or lasted two and a half hours; on t-ne contrary they all took place, in the middle ! e morning and lasted about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.id) Translation* From the Persian Minister for 'Fore-^n Af r airs ,a'dresLed to His •'cjeBty 's Charge fi * 'ffaires.

To the Honourable Editor, Some days a^o Colonel Biscuit, the British Consul General in the Gulf, arrived in Bahrain from Bushire with two men of war which are generally anchored off Bushire. Shaikh Hamad, the so-called acting Governor of Bahrain went on board the ship to receive him ana ^.hey came ashore together and in accordance with the instructions issued, a salute of 11 guns was given 'by the Government of Bahrain, An hour lifter the arrival of the Obnsul General in Bahrain the merchants and guilds were invited to the Consulate and the Consul General received each guild in turn and talked to them. The Persian merchants were received privately and were tolc that those of them who had been in Bahrain more than 3C years were con sidered as subjects of Bahrain because in accordance with the rules and regulations persons who had inhabited a locality for ten years were accounted subjects of that place; the Persian merchants refuted the statement of the Consul Gexieral and said that they were Persians and subjects of lers^a and Bahrrin was their ^-.o^crty and that therefore they d-d not agree rith the statement made b^ the Consul Genera}- The Consul General then said^Yes, you are Bahrainis even if you are Persian subjects'. ?he -ersians were anxiour on hearing these words and kept silent and soon afte theythey dispersed. The Consul General thought that the people of Bahrain were without knowledge of events and imagined that as soon as he had said that they must give up Persian subjection and take out Bahrain passports they would im iec' lately r &lt;ccept and _ive up the honour of their Persian nationality. Verily British agents in Bahrain are trying as much as possible to force Persians to give up their nationality and are preparing the ground for depriving Persia of its rights over Bahrain, but the Persians are alive to this plan and are watching events with open eyes for they know ^ahr-.in and the Bahrain islands to be Persian and will hold out in the face of coveteousness and threats; pnly a number of Arabs and Shp.ikhs, for purposes of personal advantage, han w on to them ( the British). ''olonel Biscuit, the British Consul General, talks of the Government of Bahrain! But everybody knows that after the dismissal of Shaikh Issa bin 'li al Khalifeh there was nobody and there was no trace of any Government. .Vhy? Only rarely is the seal of Shaikh Hamad bin issa cl Chalifeh, the deputy Governor of Bahrain, seen beneath some decree. But really if you ask who is the Governor of Bahrr in, when was he elected and where is he actually, nobody will be able to answer ^ou -ecause this Governor is a marionette whom nobody recog nises officially. It was the 17th of Aban(November 8th) that Colonel Biscuit visited and inspected he Government offices in Bahrain and ordered that all Persian employees should be dismissed. If the British pray that we in no wise .,.0 ■ wise mix up in the Government of Bahrain and aver that the latter has a separate and independent Government which is run by the Shaikhs and sei^e hold of this pretext as an answer to Persia, what name can you give, pray, to £ c - a situation? What is the meaning of interfering in tne affairs of Bahrain? Yes. Colonel Biscuit came to ahrain with new orders and arranged affairs in accordance with the instructions he ha r i recriv-a. Yesterday there was a protracted meeting between Shaikh Ali Mujtehid, who inhaoits the village of Sinatinis (one of the villages of Bahrain) and Colonel Biscuit. Shaikh '11 Mujtehid is an old man who is also paralytic and of some influence. They sent a car for him and he came to the Consulate in the Consul -General's car. The meeting lasted in secrecy for ahout two and a half hours and nobody heard the secrets of this interviev; cut thing is sure and that is that they are starting flans to harm and destroy the rights of Persia an: Persians. It is rumoured that as in the year 1341. they wish with the help of Shaikh Ali Mujtehid to sow discord a^am between Bahrainis and Arabs and foster internal strife because the Arabs of Bahrain are strenously opposed to the present system of Government and do not recognise officially the Government institutions, 3nd th-^ opposition of the Arabs is to such an extent, that they refuse to send their children to the schools of this ■p TJ-rif-ioVi* for this reason they puppet Government of the Sri is. , ^ o- wish to rouse the Bahrainis against the ,.r ls . Another coSition which has aroused the hostility of » • • • i -M22) -4- of the Are Ids and in which they do not acquiesce is that regarding the law courts, for they dislike submitting to the law which is administered by ' ritish agents. During these days an Indian name Khan ahadur ;)eyed 3adiq, formerly assistant in the British Consulate at Bahrain, has arrived, and it is rumoured that the British wish to cancel their former judiciary and are now forming the oasis for a judiciary to function under the direction f the afore mentioned Seyed so that the whole of the inhabitants of Bahrain will i.e subject to the laws of his court. Briefly, s-nce the day that the Persian Government took certaxn steps regarding its claim to possess Bahrain and appealed to the League of Nations, the British have interfered more than before in the internal affairs there and are preparing plans and stratagems for furthering their objects, but at the same time they are tryin_ to do it in the name of the Government of Bahrain, Colonel Biscuit has lately I ought a large plot of ground near the Mahriq fort and is startin^ to erect an important building there, and it is rumoured that the centre of the British Consulate General will be transferred to Bahrain, Contrary to former times, nearly every day or every other day British Crovernment 'planes visit ahrain. The building known as Quarantine, which belongs to the deposed Shaikh Issa bin Ali al Khalifeh, has been bought by the British Govtrnment for Rupees 15,000 and it has been made the aeroplane centre. Finally, the fresh steps which the British Consul General is taking, both openly a -1 w». * * * •W m wm axid secretly, mark a new ciiapter in Bahrain anu all 3ahrainis, especially we Persians, are openin.^ our eyes and looking on with interest at hio actions to see how far they vvill ■jo. course oar honourable Ministers are paying attention to the situation and will not allow the ohvious rights of Persia in Bahrain to be trampled on.

From Captain C.G.Prior I.A. Political /gent, Bahrain. To The Hon'ble Lt.-Col.H.V.Liscoe, I.A. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to say that for some time past the Bahrain Government have viewed with increasing annoyance the attacks made on them in Egyptian and Syrian papers. These artciles generally describe the Ruler as a half witted nonentity, a pensioner of the British, and usually show that the patriotic inhabitants are manfully resisting our insidious penetration in spite of great personal danger and persecution. 2. The most pestilent of these periodicals ie the 1 / 1-Shourah * of Cairo, and a certain ^Qialid bin FerraJ who was found to be writing inflammatory articles for them was deported from Bahrain by Captain Alban. I enclose a sam ple of their handiwork, which shows how the most harmless of incif entf can be made a vehicle for their venom. Their present correspondent is unknown, and it is possible that the articles are posted from Kuwait or some other port. 3. The Bahrain Government have asked that the Imperial Post Office at Bahrain should be instrcuted to inter cept all copies of the 1 Al-Shourah • entering Bahrain, and that it should be declared a proscribed newspaper for these islands. I warmly recommend their suggestion, and would re quest that the necessary authority may be issued to the Post master. ' ost of these papers have a very limited circulation and when they find that they can be hit by a loss.of subscrip tions they will learn better manners.Page 2* 4. Further, the Bahrain Government have a sice d that all British Consular 'Officers in the middle East should be asiced not to issue visas for Bahrain to any person describing him or her self as an author or journalist, or to any person who 1 is known to he in any v .ay connected with the press, '^his re quest refers to Arabs# and is caused by the disgusting be haviour of this type of person. TvTost are connected with papers that are little more than organs for blackmail and scracely a week pa f ses without one or more dfscending on Tah- rain ai.d taking their toll of the Ruler's hospitality. In return, they write articles which have little or no foundation of fact and have no hesitation in referring to the Ruling family in terms of the grossest disrespect. 5. It may be argued that Shaikh Hamad is foolish to give anything to these itinerant Journalists, and th^t il he did not receive them co rteously they would not come to Bah rain. This is probably quite true, but when so magnificent a person as H.M.the King of the Hedjaz is well known to pay handsomely for promising propaganda, it would be difiicult for His Excellency to make a stand once these persons have actually arrived at Bahrain, an&lt;? by far the simplest method is to exclude them. 6. In British India it is a criminal offence to publish articles attacking the Rulers of Indian States, and I would be glad to know whether it would be possible to have any pressure brought to bear though the jovernments ol Syria and Egypt respectively to prevent these attacks, or at any rate by interception in the post or other means to discover who the authors of the articles are so that they may be dealt with from this end.

He says, after explaining that the amjority of the inhabitants were Persians, ' 'he director of the Municipality who was a Persian until a few years ago and who com manded strong influence owing to the enthusiastic support that he received from the Persian polupation and he Officer Commanding the Forces ( Internal Police ) who was also a Persian were both compelled to retire like all other Persians who were in office as a Result of the intrigues and machinations of the British. Regarding Y.E. he says: Shatkh Hamad is age about 59; He is a man of very strong physique optimistic, modes, of simple manner and credulous. Thile his father was rtill in Power, Major Daly in duced him to go with him to London where he was re- ^ ceived in audience My King George, and where he was entertained brilliantly. Hr was ta.cen to the military stores of the War Office and to other British insti tutions and was filled with awe and admiration of the great power of the British Government. On his return to Bahrain intrigues were set up for the suppression of his father and his nomination to the Sha^khdom. He was then encouraged to disband his Arab troops and a garrison of 500 Indians was quartered in Kaleh 'haikh nominally for his protection, and -here is another contingent oi kit 25 0 in the British Consulate. The garrison in Kaleh Shaikh is com manded by Captain Parke who is called the officer commanding the Kale h p haikh troops/ -A ■ - - ■All the properties of the brothers and cousins of Shaiich Isa al Kha- lifah were confiscated and pensions ranging from 2000 to 10,000 rupees were given to them. Shaikh Isa and Shaikh Hamad each receive a monthly stipend of'Rs 10^000. 'fter the revolt of the ersians, an individual named Dal- rymple elgrave a rvived at Bahrain and opened an office apart from the British Consulate which he called the office of the Counsellor to the Government of Bahrain. Shaikh Hamad had two seals prepared ei^xctly similar to each other with this inscription, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, and the oter is in the hands of the British Counsellor who uses it for sealing all orders letters and judgments which are then put into force. &lt;7/ A a-, A t— ^</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00035d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/126</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00035d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/126</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/11 Proscribed newspapers and seditious press articles'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1921/1930</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-08-02T00:00:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (130 folios)</extent><extent>Items within the file have been arranged in chronological order, from the earliest at the front to the latest at the end.</extent><extent>Foliation: The file is foliated from the front cover to the end of file.
