COllDITIOH OF Ghaikh Galira oin Sulainan bin Suwailim who figure Or TTTTI' Y under this heading in last year's report arrived in Muscat on BOth January. ~ T e wa^ summoned on account oi various complaints urged against Mm by British subjects resident at °&gt;ohar. He returned to ^ohar or the St^ April aro the rumour of his return war sufficient to or use trouble among the PaM TTmar. T^e hall namaged to patch up a peace but trouble broke out again between the Ba\ i TTmor and the Ha was ireh supported by the Yal 'aad early in 'Icy. T. .e Hawasineh suffered severely. This Wall Salim bin Sul \iman returned seriously ill to Muscat end died on tne oth .lure. He was replaced by his brotner Mozafar.There was 'the ubu&amp;I crop of inter tribal disputes curing tie year in the Oman district but the year began with a settlement effected between the Ban! Jabir and Al la'awal trices by Shaikos Saif bin Sulaiman of Thau of the Bani Jabir and Shajitikh Sulai.ian bin Nasir of the Al Ma'awal. This settlement was confirmed by T Tis highness the ^ultan. The whole trouble was very nerrly re- -opened at Mattra by high-handed action on the pert of a tribes- -man of Al Ma'awal assisted by a negro slave of the ^ali of Mattra but fortunately the w ali ar.d 'haikh 'laif bin Suleiman were in time to avert what would probably have been a serious affray by enforcing prompt restitution to the Bani Jabir su£fere^r In March from hur orme news of trouble among the Beni Su Massan who attacked the tower°Jir:ah but failed to take it . There was loss of life on both sides but the Arabs suffered severely. There was further serious fig vtirg about the same -time at Khaburah between the tribes of Mawasinah on the one side and Bani Khalid and Bani Zara on the other. The number of killed r»a reached nearly 200 and Mis Highness pent ~aiyid Badar bin -aif to make an enquiry and arrange terms of peace. On the 28th June, Miaikh Saif bin Bulaiman of the Bani Jabir of Thau '•'ied of aoute rheumatism. Ghalib bin Ali, ?T is Highness's w a li of Gwpdur,arrived at Muscpt | in the end of July and left again after a stay of about 0 weeks. At an interview in October,His Highness informed the Poli- -tioal Agent that the Bani Bu VhebrIk Ali were fighting with the Bani Bu Hassan and at TT is Highness's request,the Political Agent wrote warning British Indien subjects trading in lur and Ja'alan to keep away from the disturbed locality. ARMS TRAFFIC. The returns which usually accompany this report have been prepared this year and are attached as appendices. The most striking feature of these returns is to show that in spite the blockade,the arms trade has recovered from the various blows dealt to it and the import figures for the year 1911 are back again to the import figures for 1909. Another salient point&amp;( 2 ) Ip thft during the past two year? 1910 an' 1 1911 Gerrapn B’'ipping has profited over British shipping to a greater extent t ar appeared in 1909,though even in that year,the greater part of the imported arms end ammunition was carried In German bottoms. The large Afghan trade via the Makran coast has undoubt- _edly suffered severely. Ferheps the most evident proof of this was the settlement arrived at between the leading Muscat arms trader All Khan and the principal Afghan gun-runners in the man month of November which it is unnecessary to describe in deteil here. It showed clearly thet the principal Afghans were anxious to get out of the business. It seems clear that the principal activity in the arms trade has shifted up north and if arms in any quantity are carried by sea at all after they leave Muscat,they must be look -ed for mainly west of Has Musandum and probably ro far up as Qatar and Kuwait.The answer to the problem ”what becomes of t^e arms?' has not so far as the writer krows been ^isoovfred but it becomes at leant worth considering whether it should not be looked for in Centre 1 Arabia and Turkey in Asia rather than in Persia and Afghanistan. The actual figures for the steamer trade of 1911 are:- in Oerman bottoms Be.10,50,360 ; in British bottoms Rs.5,12,770 total Rs.1563130 as ageinst last year's totel of Rs.6,20,550. Prices do not seem to heve varied materially.A comparative statement for the years 1910 and 1911 will be found below, statement showing approyimete prices at the end of 1911. Local name. A R M : S .

I oame vmm 0W1 'mA &amp; Very different ac^ur.ts however oame from the districts of Cmen Cholera was reported no less than 5 times during the year: in the end of January a severe epidemic carried off about Sot of the Bar.i Bu Hassan and 150 of the Bari Bu All tribes in 'ur and Ja'alan. Among the victims of this epidemic were shaikh Sultan,grandson of Amir Abdulla bin Balim of Ja’alan and Shaikhs Rashid bin ta,mad and All bln Jumaiah of the Banl Bu Mi. The outbreak was stated later to have spread to Sharqiyah and was reported very virulent at Rostak and Bidiyah. In July, cholera was again reported from Ja'alan among the Bani Hassan villages and another slight outbreak of the di- -see'-e was reported from sur at the end of August. small-pox was reported In the beginning of February from Falaj and again in May from the Batina coast where Shaikh Bail bln Salim, His Highness the Sultan's Wall of Suwalq.with his 3 on fell a victim to the disease. His Highness wa* greatly attached to this official and felt his loos deeply. There was a slight reorudesoense of plague in Sab a. Kuryat in May when the disease had begun to die out in Muscat itself. ' CUSTOMS AMD LARDING Abdul Karim,a low class Poona Muhammadan ARRANGEJFKTS. oontinued t0 nonage His Ughness's Customs department for him. The issue of goods to consignees without production of delivery orders or Bills of Lading still oonti- -nues and leads to many difficulties and some oppression. Tn the end of August,His Highness the Sultan at last got tired of the slack business methods of his landing contractor Abdul Qadir and a particularly glaring theft by the latter s bortmen led to his down. fall. For some tine,the landing arrange- -ments were conducted by the Customs Superintendent,Abdul Karim and landing charges were Imre lately enhanced by oO. . There is no doubt that in the past they were too low to admit of profitable working wit out dishonesty.In the end of October 'Tis highness permitted the Landing arrangements to be under- -taken by a company of four men of whom the leader is Ali Khan the noted Baluch arms dealer. The other three are Zubrir, aolerk of His Highness; Haaian.an Arab subject and en®loy^ at the British post oflioe and Muhammad Kathurl.who was the late partner of the ex landing contractor, Abdul ®adlr,a:id enjoys an evil reputation. These appointments are a clear departure from time honoured custom in Muscat whereby Importers,of whom 7S*' are British In 'ian subjects .appoint their own agent subject to His -Ughness‘s approval. But British subjects, consignees, have only themselves to thank for the loss of this privilege. as they are hopelessly divided among themselves and have only one object in view the cutting down of landing rates. As soon as the natural result follows.badly paid employes and barefaced theft,they are full of complaint but cannot unite to put au end to the unsatisfactory rtate of affairs. At present then* is, so far as the Political Agent is aware, no landing contract of any kind but there has been a marked diminution of oomp la lilts and it is difficult to imagine any arrangement that could be worse than f^/t of Abdul Qadir. PTAVS TRAP/. Puring the year linger report 48 applications were received from s&lt;(laves for freedom of whom 71 were from Makran -and 17 from Zanzibar. Of the 48 applicants 24 were freed/and manumission granted. Pix more slaves whose cases were pending during 1910 were also freed during the year. ROYAL FAVY. T Ii8 Fxoellency the haval Commander-i:.-Chief paid two' visits during the year to Muscat. On the lirst occasion i:„ the month of January official visits were exchanged between MJs highness and His Excellency. His Excellency arrived again on the Frd ^fey but id not lan^ owing to quarantine and left after a day’s stay. All the other ships of the East Indies Squadron have been constantly in and out of the port in oonr.eotion with the arms treffic operations. FOITMcft r AVY.

The American mission has been active through- -out the year. ‘Or Garrison's hospital at !4attra,in the begin- -ning of the year charged no fees and became therefore very popular. Miss Tutton too opened a small dispensary in the Mission House at Muscat and paid frequent visits to the Gultans harem and others,sometimes as a private visitor and sometimes as medical adviser. Dr Tarrison accompanied by xoahwat liddin , a compounder, and an American colporteur left for the interior of Oman on the 24th January. He was reported beyond Rostak in the begin- -ning of April where cholera was prevalent and he gave so ie medical relief to the sufferers. He returned on the i ay but almost immediately left Mattra for Kuwait and the mission hospital at Mattra was closed for the summer until tne arrival of hr Thoms in October. / WDATHFR A &gt;T D R'H*FATH-.

Himilar hea^^ damage was reported from Owadur where TT aji Musa,brother of the Native Assistant was killed by the collapse oi his house. The rainfall for the year amounted to 3.98 inches. The hot weather was late in coming but the heat in Jufcp and July was intense. The heat in the latter month was also unduly prolonged and Muscat did not feel the benefit of the monsoon until the beginning of August. The highest temperature reoor'ed was 110.0° on the 21st Jure . ’Tie highest average day temperature was 101.6°in the month of July and the highest average night temperature was 89.4° in the north of July.

Agency Surgeon, Muscat• Ciiolera 'broke out in Muscat towards the end of September and continued till the end of November; during that time there was a period from the 1st till the 19th of October during which no case was heard of. The cases occurred almost entirely among the Faluchis and Seedies of the poorest classes who live outside the walls in miserable huts where the conditions are filthy in the extreme and where there is much crowding. Only about 10 cases occurred inside the town itself where the sanitary’ conditions are considerably better. The number of cases reported was 95 of these 81 died but as the great majoritj^ of cases were not reported till after death it may be assumed that many cases recovered which were not reported. However the general health and conditions of life of the class affected is poor which would help to account for a very high mortality. Males and fema3es were attached ir about equal proportion. About SO of the cases were children. The ca:‘es seen presented the ordinary symptoms of cholera. Very- few of the cases applied for medicines or if they did it was only when the disease was far advanced. The relations, etc. were advised to bum clothing and ether articles infected or at least to soak them well in antiseptics, which were supplied free for this purpose. These suggestions were carried out in almost every case, and they seem to have been fairly successful as generally not more than one case occurred in each dwelling. The infection was probably brought by dhows a large number of which come here. The first cases heard of however were among people who had been living in Muscat for some time. Cholera occurred in several otl about the same time. i --A note on the New Charitable 'ueott I.ftrrh Hosoitai by . t r in UN.C* •l/loVern t M.B* # I. . .

The Agency flagstaff as well as His Highness* forts,yacht and the Foreign Consulates were dressed for the occasion. The political Agent received congra— —tulatory visits from His Highness the sultan,the Foreign Consuls and the heads of the British Indian communities. The Ramadan Id was celebrated on the IIth September and on the 20th November the Bakri Id£ On both occasions the Agency flag- -staff was dressed. HIS HIGHNESS THE SULTAN The fiealth of His Highness the Sultan AND FAMILY. has been good. The temporary indisposition,referred to in last year 's report,in consequence of a fall from a camel,had noserious effects and His Highness returned to Muscat on the 13th January after an absence of 6 weeks from his capital• His Highness was however confined to his palace for some time and did not appear in public# The relations between His Highness and the Agency have been very cordial. His Highness has remained in Muscat throughout the year e-:c^pt for 2 short periods in September and December when he visited Sur and Sohar. His Highness engaged the services of one Mr Baiyanker, a Madrassi engineer,and contracted vith him for the supply of electric fans and lights in His Highness* palace and that of his son Saiyid Taimur*s and the surroundingsof the palace and the Customs at a cost of Rs.5,000. Muscat now boasts of elec- -tric lights# There was another proposal to light the towns of Muscat and Muttra but in this Mr Baiyanker did not succeed,as the necess- 4 -ary funds were not forthcoming. On the 11th August,Joakah bint Twain! bin Sa’id^an influential and an elderly member of the Sultan’s family^ died! The Politi- -cal Agent wrote a letter of condolence to His Highness which was suitably acknowledged# Owing to this event^His Highness did not celebrate the Rama ^an Id festival as usual. Sheikh Suleiman bin Abdur Rahim,Jamadar of the fort Jelali,St) died on t.he 2nd of May. On the 2nd of January Saiyid Taimur,who had been to Bombay to witness the reception of Their Imperial Majesties,returned to Muscat and immediately visited his father at sib^returning to Muscat on the 6th. In May,he made a short tour in the in- -terior of Oman and , again in August,he spent a fortnight on the Batina coast. Saiyid Nadir visited Sur in “Noor ul Bahr 1 * in May. On the 19th December he left again for Ismaili and remained in the inte rior till the close of the year. CONDITION OF The event of the year in Muscat tribal history the' country. - was the murder,in the month of March,of Sa 1 id bin Ibrahim, •u ruler of Rostak,by his cousins Ibrahim and Muhammad,vho were immediately afterwards killed by the soldiers of the Sultan. Rostak has always been a thorn in the side of the ruler of Oman but it does not appear that his influence has advanced there appreciably,as Ahmed,the younger brother of Sa*id bin Ibrahim, is ruling there undisturbed. Sheikh Buti bin Suhail,the late Sheikh of Debai,visited His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in the month of March and stay- -ed here some 10 days. Early in May,there were troubles between the Hawasineh,headed by Sheikhs Nasir and Saif bani Hamad and the Bani Oomar as a result of which the ’Hawasineh Sheikh commandeered 3 boxesof ammunition union he forced British nuhject.., *Chojuo of ;jiabura # to buy . ICioJus were however aubeeluently honestly repaid and the troubles subsided. Humours have been constutntly flying about Masfcat to the effect that a universal rising of the Bedouins o* the interior will tafce place as a protest against His Highness* arrangements for regulating the Arms traffic. His Highness has also received many threatening letters 9 noteably from Sheikh Isa bln -a e 9 Al Harathl, the 'stormy petrel' of Oman politics 9 rit lothlng else has come of all these manifestations and It does not seem that tribal politics this vear have been more disturbed than ( usual. The regulation of the arms traffic should indeed. If successful and wisely used, go along way towards restoring the Sultan’s authority over the unruly tribesmen of the interior. This problem has again absorbed the energies of the Agency Staff to the exclusion of more profitable occupation. The usual returns accompany this report. The actual figures for the steamer trade of JU12 are:- i i Grerman bottoms .Rs: d0 9 ^^f 050; in British, : : ~35 # total Re: 33 t 34 # 483 as against a total of Rs:l5.63.130 last year . A slight portion of this increase can be accounted for by a rise in the price of rifles and ammunition towards the closing half of the year. The rise in imports has been shared equally between British and Cerman shipping. Another reason to account for the increased imports was that, from the beginning of the year, the arms traffic fraternity were well aware that the British authorities, in clo® communication with His Highness the oultan , were plotting against their peace and profit and. on the 11th: June . these negotiations resulted in the issue of a proclamation by His Highness, establishing the Arms’ Warehouse and setting forth rules and regulations to govern the import and export of these dangerous goods. The date fixes for the enforcement of the above notification was the 1st: of September 1612 and the armsdealers very naturally endeavoured to avail themselves to the utmost of the period of grace that still remained to them . ?ot the moment,the success of these measures Is shown hy the fact that, since the close of October, Imports Into Masqat &amp;ave ceased entirely 9 while the returns for September and October are very materially less than those for the pre ceding seven months of the year. The arms traders, and es pecially the French, are reaping a temporary enormous profit by the surreptitious sale of rifles and ammunition in defiance of the rules and regulations at double the usual prices tait stoclcs are running low and must be exhausted before long, un less the negotiations, proceeding In Furope, anent the legal ity of the proclamations and the rules made thereunder turn In favour of the French pretentions. The Warehouse was duly established on the first of Septem ber . A superintendent from India, Syud Kasim bin Dffyud * Imam Kadrl, with a previous excellent record in Government service under the Sast Africa Protectorate , was appointed thereto by His Highness the Sultan with the approval of the Government of India . Syud Kasim has a difficult taslc to carry out and has shown marked ability,zeal and discretion therein. The building^ approprated to the ends of the Warehouse , are conveniently situated close to the Customs House,accommodation is adequate and records and accounts are In good order . At pres ent, the local Oman market is so glutted with arms that there is little opportunity for legitimate sale but, as the situat ion clears and the question of ^ench acquiescence in the rules and regulations , relating to the arms trade, adjusts itself, there seems no reason why the Warehouse should not pay its way. The opposition of the local tribesmen, already alludedt to In this report, does not seem serious. It may be Interesting to note here , as a sign of the commencement of confidence in Syud Kasim on the part of His Highness the Sultan that the latter has permitted Svud Kasim al to work, at small cost, some experiment lime-kilns , near Uaskfct Syud ^asIn believes that he will be able considerably to increaai 9- chid-fit h Md l*£* L Spfipty H'thli'd ILy fi£/*/Ldfi*,/o o'tnd t* Ka. .Pimi.TC HEAl-ffH , The quarantine arrangements, ^udor the HOSPITAL AND sup elision of the Agency Surgeon^have worked well during the year. Tlie Manm-ii public health has been good and^with the tXttfjZOL fiff-A- solitary plague case landed from one of the B.r.ships,which L fortunately got well,there were no epidemic diseases either I in Muscat or Muttra during the year. The Agency hospital was open to the public and the number of patients treated during the 12 months is 5180 daily average being 14.13. PILGRIMS ACT. With the previous apnroval f)l' His Majesty* s Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs,the (Indian) Pil- -grim Ships Act,1895(XIV of 1895) was made applicable to British ships within the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat with effect from 1st August 1912, Three pilgrim ships of the Bombay—Persia S, ;«. oy. ,Limited, vi sited Muscat during the year with pilgrims for Jeddah. One of them was found to be carrying more pilgrims than were shown on her certificate and,as her sanitary and accommodation arrangements were unsatisfactory,the ship detained and the excess 59 pilgrims were landed at Muscat and subsequently reshipped for Jeddah at the Coy s expense. CUSTOMS AND His Highness’ Customs remained in the manage- I AND IN G *management of Abdul Karim throughout the year and the Ian -ing arrangements with the company of the 4 Arabs referred to in last year’s report. Complaints of petty thefts and pil- -fering on board the ships have been fe^ and the landing arrangements seem to have worked satisfactorily, complaints | however of pilfering on the Customs* wharf are still oooa- -sionally received and would no^ doubt be still more frequent,| if there were any likelihood of redress^of^the punishment of offenders. To facilitate the landing of cargo^His Highness has begun building a jetty running out from his customs wharf 100 fe t out to sea. His Highness approached the Political Agent with a view to collecting ma’asharat (export duty) from British subjects in the Batinah ports. The question was placed before the leading British Indian merchants who objected to the proposal on the grounds that His Highness* authority in those parts was so weak that the result of any such orders would be that British merchants would pay the ma'asharat,whereas Arab mer- -chants,in those parts usually Bedouin Sheikhs,vould escape. They therefore thought that,in the Batinah ports,the ma'asha- -rat should be levied from the cultivators,who would be able to collect from merchants by charging a higher price for their goods. The proposal therefore fell through and His Highnesshas not raised it again. SLAVE TRADE. During the year under report,applications for free- -dom were received from 46 slaves of whom 3P; were freed. Of the 46,15 were from Mekran and the from Zanzibar. HDYAL. Sis Excellency the Hon’ble Sir Alexander .Bethel}-, K.CvM'.G, ,Rear Admiral and Naval Commander-in-Che if of the East Indies Scuadron,visited Muscat twice during the year on board the j H.M.S.'Highflyer”. His first visit was in April and the second lasted from soth September to 2nd December. This is the first time in Muscat history that an English Admiral has stayed at I Muscat for over two months. All the other ships of the East Indies Squadron have been cons- -tantly in and out of the port in connection with the arms traffic operations and,when the Admiral visited Muscat on the second occasion,6 men-of-war remained stationed in the port lor months. | FOREIGN NAVY . No Foreign man-of-war visited Muscat during the year under report. JU AMERICAN AND 'CARMELITE . R evd.Father Bernard of the Carmelite MISSIONS. — 4 Mission visited Muscat in May. The American Missionaries have been active as usual throughout the year, Dt*« Mordyke visited Muscat during the year. Dr.Thoms has remained in charge of the Mutura Hospital and has made him- -self very popular. The Mission has bought and rebuilt a room in the bazaar at Muscat wherein books are sold by a Baghdadi Christian.WEATHER AI'IU Daring the month oi January,a ro vei^ ouun RAINFALL. -wil',belonging to Shahin bin Ghanim,was reported wrecked and lost I with her cargo of dates in the vicinity of Muscat. Of the 44 souls j? on board, 7 had reached Sib and Barka. The rainfall for the year amounted to °.59 inches, he hot ^eatner though it lasted longer than usual, was not,for Muscat^severe. I The Highest temperature during the year recorded was 11 ■. on tae ■w. * 26th May. The highest average day temperature was 104.5 in the a month of June and the highest average night temperature was 90.1 in the month of July. The lowest day temperature recorded was 65.4°on the 27th January and the lowest night temperature was 57.4 on the 1st January. Tables of temperature and rainfall are appended. TOURS OF POLITICAL The political Agent made a short tour to Ofnan 'AGENT. ports during the month of January in the R. T. .S • ‘Minto 11 kindly placed at his disposal by the Senior Naval Officer. In the course of his tour^the Political Agent visited Kuriyaf,SurjMasna,Sohar and Shenas. VISITS OF DISTINGUISHED In the month of February^Mr J'CB'.'Wood,C. officials; I.E•,of the Foreign Department of the Government of India visited Muscat in connection with the introduction of economies in the working of the offices in the Persian Gulf. In fearch,Lord Lamington,the late Governor of Bombay,visited Muscat on his way to Persia and in December came Mr.A. A ^ounghusband, C* ^ .,C*S.To,late Commissioner in Sind. FOREIGN INTERESTS . The American Consul has visited Nis Highness and has received return visits. He has also paid officirl visits to Commanders and the Admiral of H.W’s Navy on various nsiono. r During August^the American Consul made a sho^fc walking tour in the interior,in the course of which he visited Wathaiya,Boshar and other neighbouring places. In the month of October, 2 Americans visited Muscat with the object of studying the date cultivation in Oman. They visited the interior in company with the American Consul and eventually left for Basra. Their visit to the interior is however connected with an incident which may be of some interest.* On their return journey, some Bedouins of the Thabi tribe fired on the party near Radda. Fortunately,no one was hurt and the explanation given is a plausible one that they were mistaken for a raiding party, / f Two lists of subjects and proteges of other Christian powers,re- -sident in Muscat,are appended M I5CELIANEO US. On the 25th November the interment of a sailor from HiM.S.'Highflyer' called attention to the crowded condition of the Sheikh Jabir European cemetery,south of Muscat, The matter was brought to the notice of His Highness the Sultan o who was graciously pleased to place another small strip of coast line also to the south of Muscat,at the disposal of the EuropeanNote on the Musoat-Mutrah Hospital for the year ending ^Ist December 1912 by Captain J, /.Little, . z. ,B.S. , ' • .y Surgeon Muscat, •oooo- The Total number of out-door patients treated was o,l iO, being nearly double that in 1911. There were 150 indoor patientsj accommodated^against 142 in the preceeding year. Of these in- -door patients 24 were Europeans and American,chiefly belonging to the Navy, The number of operations performed shows a marked / increase being 140,compared with 99 in preceeding year. 1 ni' satisfactory,all round increase is in a great measure due to the Patience and tact displayed by Sub-Assistant-Surgeon 4.1 , Mascarenhas who was in sub-medical charge throughout the year, carrying out his duties to my entire satisfaction. For nearly two months the Hospital was without a compounder, which entailed considerable inconvenience and extra work for the Sub-Assistant-Surgeon in charge. Eventually a youth,straii from school,was appointed as Compounder,who promises to turn out satisfactorily as he is intelligent and hardworking and has made considerable progress during the short time he has been in Muscat. The subordinate staff is inadequate, a vard—coolie or -rd servant is badly needed to help in the wards,to do the dusting of the hospital and cleaning of the operation room,where the&lt;4 presence of a sweeper is not desirable* The buildings are only in a fair state of repair c ing to want of funds* Im. / / MUSCAT. u ^ Captain,AD¥I:U3T«ATIGN itSPOiST GJ?

TITS NTCHNE33 THE SUIZTAN On the evening of the 4th October m the present 3 year^Nis lighnasa Sultan Sir Syud Faisal bin Turki.G. Sultan of Muscat and Oman,died of a dropsy. Though for some yeaf,hio health nad occasionally snown disquieting symptoms, Nis Higmess was actively attending to State alfairs during tne month® of August and the first .ialf of SepmemiLiQr.Ev en * as 28tn September,tne Agency Surgeon,wno was,with Major ^,uruuc ludson, I«M.S,,in constant attendance on '{is {ignness until tne very end, anticipated no immediate danger,though the Sultan’s condition gave cause for grave anxiety. Relation® between Mi® Highness and the Agency were exceedingly -ordial until the sad event recorded above took place. As the ^ Imam's rebellion gathered strengthens Highness came to rely more•« and taora on fie advice and aoslo-tance of tfie rirltied autio- -ritlee and it was remarked,in more direotiona than one,fiat fie rebellion bad shown His Highnena where his true interests lay and on whose friendship he - ould oonfidendtly rely. Syud Faisal bin Turk! be ane Sultan of Wus at in 1883,suooaiir- | -ing his father Syud Turk! bin 3a'id whose serond^he was. He was not however recognised as 3ultan of \lus and Onan by the British Cksvernaent until 1890. In 18 &gt;5,a ‘ -• •‘- e r1- -sing of the Hinawi tribesmen took place against him,when *&gt; rebels actually penetrated Muscat and Syud Faisal was turned temporarily out of his place and became a.refugee i &gt;« Eastern fort of Muscat, itfthe tine of nis death,ne was fa-ed with another serious rebelion,which is described later in this report.We nay alnost say fiat lis reign too narked tie ~ rise of the ams traffic which so frequently inpe.i ' .'.cr friendly relatione between his State and the British Oovernnen It nay be possible to hope that the Warehouse which he esta- -blished last year nay practically nark the close of this troublesome question so far as con-ems Mus-at. The other nain controversy whl-h troubled Musc at tranquillity during 3yud Faisal’s reign was the ' French flag* question, settled in favour of the views of one Sultan and 'one riro .iah Government by the Hague tribunal in 19C5, A mu h abused nan, while he lived,Syud Faisal bin Turk! has, tn nany quarters, been deeply regretted since his death. He was undoubtedly a weak ruler but his pleasant genial manners and accessibility won aim some popularity. He never wanoed. personal courage and was undoubtedly kindly and nonane. He could never,at least so far as the writer could observe,find it in his- leart to punish any body and the natural result, In a place like Muscat, was chaos in the adninintration. T le loud lamentations,that a-oompanied his corpse to its la'■ resting pla* e,were not altogether due to the hysteria of the -rowd.That Muse at declined greatly In prosperity during his reign was mot due so mu h to any action or negle t on thepart of faa ruler but to external oirouTantanoes over whiob be 'xad no ontrol • Wuob of tb© transport ^r^ r ie wbl 'h. Vus' at catered for to tbe snaller ‘Tersian and Arab porta, baa novr disappeared owiag to the direct vis its of ot earner e drom India and Surope to those porta. The tribes of Goan had never any Justification for their rebellious attitude towards a ruler who never troubled them with taxation nor oppressed them in any way. 9o far as his means admit- -ted,he was generous to tne tribesmen and it was probably ojily his weakness, coupled witn r'jmours as to tae posBicle effect of the new arms traffic regulations,ta*t tempted tnen to darken tie closing days of his existence. Gn the 23rd February,8yud Badar bin 3aif,of tna Ayal boo Said,who was known as the commander in ;hie^,died at Muscat T le was perhapw the most respectable member of the Sultan’s entourage but did not appear to enjoy much influence or exercise any authority. A member of the Sultan* s family who may &lt; ome into greater prominence later on is 3yud Dthiyab bin #ahad bin Turtci, who arrived at Muscat about June of the present year, e has been educated in England^talks English fluently, ie is a young man of piaaant manners and appearance; on State occasions he,witn Syuds Nadir and Muoammad,remains in attendance on Syud Taimur but does not bo far intenere^ to any great extent in tae administration. Ever since the death of dis late di gone so, Syud Mu-iaamad bin Turk! and his sons have been living in tne closest retirement and are never seen abroad. Syud Muiammad evi- -dently felt aggrieved at the recognition of Syud Taiiur ^ as Sultan and, although the present Sultan and his brothe-r Muhammad invariably visit their urvle and his family once a week,he shows no signs of being pa ified and continues to 'sulk** . Relations between the present Sultan and the Agon y have always remained friendly and even cordial,in spite of some differen es of opinion in the affair of the deport-deportation of All Uooaa of which aore horeafta*. Very ain^ ere efforts have undoubtedly been made in the flirect- -ion of reform,espe' ially in the matter of the 10 'al adminio- -tration of Juatire and of the customo,perhaps the two dire&lt;t- -iona in which it was chiefly needed• It would appear tofct the present sultan is too mu .h inclined to rely solely on tne ad- -vice of aubair and Anmed as Snubailie Taese men are both of Arab extraction but tne latter .aas acquired a British natio- -nality and is well known in Bombay, ie is a xaan of some ability and business knowledge. 2ubair seems to be little beyond a Buooessful courtfrer . Of Hie ^ig , ^ness , brotier8,Syud Muiammad bin Paioal seems to have some influence and has the general reputation of beihg the ' lever boy of the family.Syud Nadir seems to have some strength of character and the magisterial work of Vus at falls chiefly on his shoulders.Of 3yud Hamad,the 4th son, we hear little in these days.During the ' losing msndtiu months of his life,3yud Faisal showed him some favour and it is possible that he is now paying the penally. XNDITIGN OP THE The rising of the Oman tribes,under the HOUNTBY. leadership of the so called Imam of Tanuf, Salim bin Basnid al Kaaxusi,naa overshadowed all ot.ier/ events in Oman tribal nis- —tory for the year uiider report. This rising was due to the * i preachings of the principal Abbathi 3.iaikh,Abdulla bin iamad as Saliml. Us method has been to misrepresent tie Warehouse as a subtle device of the English for depriving the Oman tribes of modem weapons and especially of ammunition, so that they might reduce the tribes to impotence and then ride rough shod over them. The first results of these machinations were the alarmist re- -ports that reaehed Muscat in the 3rd week of May 1913 that Shaikh Abdulla as Salimi had set up his son-in-law,Salim bin Rashid,as ' Imam of the Muslmin H .The rebellion spread rapidly, Niswah fell about the beginning of June and the Wall,3alyld Saif bin Hammad,committed suicide,fearing to fall into ^he hands of tue rebels.

He relies too a good deal on a frieniiy feeding which appears to have existed,even in his father's time,between himself and Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harathi.Au ordingly,on . ie 18th Hovember,3haikn Hamdan bin iS'aid.aos orapanied by certain chief a of tae iawaaineh and Bani Bu iaBsan,lefx&lt; for Sib wnere they eventually met Sneika Isa bin Salen al .larat xi.-r ie rema-in- -ing rebels leader* refused to join tie conference,as did aleo the Bani Bu Ali,wno nad been aumioned to swell the following of the Abu Thabi 'Tiief,in order to make it olear to the rebels that the Sultan's forces represented both Hinawiya and Qiafiri* The only outcome so far of these negotiations has been that, on the 9th December,Shaikh Tsa bin Saleh and his bro'Gler All, wt r c paid a visit to Hie Highness at Muscat and treated wi i much honour and respect.This will,no doubt,serve to detach the Hinawiya rebels from the Imam but whether,as seems to be hoped,. His Highness will soon be able to raise a force t.ia^ will win. him back tne Samail valley,not to mention Izki, seems more than doubtful, ifor the present, a hollow truce to enable bo: : aides to tnink over matters has been arranged anu it nas been agreed tiat neither party snail break tua peace for a pe: x:d of two montns. J, The situation nad f lowever^become BO / relieved that tie presence of tie wing of the 2nd Rajput Light Infantry was no longer oondidered necessary at Bait al FalaJ and they were despatched to Bombay by the slow mail steamer which left Muscat on the 39th December. Shaikh Hamdan bin Z'aid al Khalifah of Abu Thabi remained in Muscat till the end of the year. The Amir of tTaalan, Abdul la bin Salim al Alawi,the influential Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali tribe,died in the beginning of che j year. The Political Agent re- eived a letter from the deceaseds son.

The figures of the German ateanshiojf returns ore moooi.vion- y T rfa»%y -ally much larger than those of British shipping but are nose the less roughly l/6th of laab year's imports. British shipping returnr have fallen so low as to be almost negligible, a beggarly He. 1 C,COG against the Rs. 12 , 94 ,A ?5 of the year 1912. Tne total value of the imports of arm* during the year amconte* to Ra.3,64,902 against last year's figures of Ro.3o,64,4bo, roughly l/9th. Even of the arms imported ,a very large proportion are still aeld up in the Arna' Ware- -aouee as a result of the rules of tais institution and, in all cates of arms imported, the Warehouse enables us to as- -certain with pe^rfeot accuracy, the primary destination,, after Muscat,, of the imported weapons. Of this year’s im- —porta, the orders of -{is Tighnaan the sultan and the Shaikh of Kuwait account for the larger portion. In the month of August, orders were re&lt; eived by the Political Agent and the Fran h ^onmil from their rasp©' tive Governments directing that an inventory of all Freiv h arms in private and the State Warehouses should be taken, that the arms c-on- -tained in the private Warenouses should be locked up therein and placed under the official seals of both consuls. These instructions were carried out and stocks to the approximate value of £59,624/- a ording to tne Frenv;a estimate and £43,937/- according to the Britian estimate were inventoried and placed under seal. The result of tnese measures was to withdraw from circulation, so to speak, arms to the value Of £33,000/- or over.Tho Prsti' h merohantB announoe that the negotiations regard! ig &lt; oapenoation for these nto-ks withdrawn have reached a success -ful on lusion but no official corroboration of this st-ate- —nent v ias been re eived* In the aonth of October,the ill-&lt; onsidered export ftrom the State Warehouse of a large vOnsigiuaent of c.aru icuec -i© Ban!

The banishment of this notorious arms trader has undoubtedly served to inspire all arms traders with a wholesome respect for the regulations of the State Warehouse and transactions, since hiw departure,with the Warehouse have praoti-ally ceased^ It seems certain that the returns of the Mus-at arms rafa will show an even greater diminution in the coming year and that the important e of Muse at as a distributing centre for this traffic will disappear. A comparative statement of prices for 1912-13 is at\»ai hed* ( It naturally shows an enormous increase in the price of allgoods of this description but the figures are to/ t-his extent fallacious thkt.with the Warehouse regulations,it would be difficult to find buyers and a seller who based is estlnaT.es on these prices,would undoubtedly,be disappointed.

His hostile preparations for an attack on Masqat w were on several occasions a source of considerable anxiety to His Highness. In April owing to the threatening attitude of the ’Oman tribes on the coast,where British interests are especial3y centered and where the rebels had col looted, the ports of Earka and Qaryat were bom- -barded by H.M.3. ,, Fox' and 'Dartmouth** respectively. This had a temporarily tranquil 1 sing effect and little was heard of actual activity on the part of the rebels until August when a hostile movement was again set or loot, which had the combined support7^ Arms Traffic of Shaikh Isa 13111 Sa3eli aJ Harit^i and Haiiiyar bin liaair^blr.Q Xiuaia'b obicf Liaubenart;©• Xn Hovauber tbe situation bac ? ara© sc serious that re- -inforcsuionts were sent to T aaqab.

Tie Masqat Arms Warehouse has worked well during the year and has fully Justified its establishment. There is no reason to suppose that Fis Highness has not loyally oo-operated in every way to make it a success. A glance at the usual returns,which are appended tc this report,will show that the import of arms ana ammunition into Masqat has ceased. The year's import amounts to the almost negligible sun of Rs.3,800 as against the Rs.3,84,90S of the year 1613 and Rs.33,64,486/- of £8*3 1912. Of the year's import,Rs.l ,600/- represents value of arms and ammunition imported in dorm an bottoms and the ba- -lance by British ships. The entire import rapre- -sentc St cases ammunition for His Highness• use and 6 rifles and 2600 rounds ammunition for the personal use of 3yud Yusuf as Zuwawi. 3 oases of machine guns and 62 oases ammunition and accessories imported by Fia Highness from a French firm in German bottoms do not however appearwmm mam SfV. in -tt-eae rotuma tteir value waa not declared.

A sxua of RB.4,300/-in ourrenoy notes and gold was found oor.oealed on tbeir persons together with oer- —tain papers wbiolj clearly showed that their real mission was the illicit purchase of arms.

The Resident,Aden,requested arrangamerts to be made through the Sultan for the protection and safety of the salvors. The matter was referred to His Highness the Sultan but no assistance could be sent firstly owing to there not being any of His Majesty's ships available at the time and secondly because no lives or property of British stibjects wore involved. The ship was given up as a total wreck.

During his absence on one months privilege leave and recess from the 12th October till the 30th November Captain J. M. Brickman 3rd Brahmans was in charge of current affairs. The post of Agency Surgeon continued vacant. The Medical Officer of the 108th infantry officiated as Agency Surgeon in addition to his other duties until 28th May when, on the departure of his regiment for Basra, he was relieved by the Medical Officer 3rd Brahmans. Sub-Assistant Surgeon J.P. Mascarenhas remained in charge of the Hospital and continued to do excellent work. It was intended that he should be relieved in the month of December but Muscat has such a bad name that it is difficult to find any one willing to take up the appointment. Monsieur A. Jeannier was Consul for Prance throughout the year. Abdulaziz al-luwahi continued as Dragoman. Monsieui Jeannier has now been Consul for over 7 years.up ( Ip l* Condition of tiie Country. At tho cloae of tho year 1916 the Sultan had been / unable to male© headway against the rebellion which origin ated In Ills father’s reign in 1 13 and which had deprived him of tho towns of Nizwa and Izki in the interior of Oman, the Walls ^eiaail and I&amp;awal, in which valleys he and nie family own considerable property t and of the town of Nakhl which Ilea near Burka and is about 25 ailea fron the coast. In the remainder of Oman proper tho rebel Shaikhs had thrown off all allegiance to the shadowy authority for merly posoofioed by the Salyyids or Sultana of Oman and Muscat. £i*gsx&amp;. The Port of Roataq v and the country dependent on lt f was still held by Salyyid Ahnad bin Ibrahim bin ^ais, a semi* Independent chief of tho Sultans own family of Abu A Said. The rebels,apparently determined to leave nothing to any member of tills family, decided in t;,© early months of tiie year to complete their conquests by taking this fort. The dealership of the rebellion had resolved itself into a triumvirate consisting of the Imam, Salim bin Rashid el Kharusi, representing the religious element and the tit ular head of the movement. Shaikh Isa bln Salih el iiarlthi leader of the JUnawi section and Shaikh Haoyar bin Naslr el Nabhani leader of the Ghafiri section of the Omani tribes. The attack on Rostaq had not the support of the Hlnawi leader, a fact which has had a considerable effect upon Omani politics. Of the three leaders Shaikh Isa lias by far the greatest influence outside of his tribe though Shaikh Harayar has the greater tribal following. The Chief of Rontaq had full notice of the impend ing attack and laid in aumunition and supplies. H# also wrote to his cousin,the Sultan, for assistance and His Highness sent additional stores and ammunition but the fort was in vested before they could reach their destination. His Highness having raisBdx obtained tne assistance of the Shaikh of Baralni raised a force of some 2000 or 3000 imen ani attempted to relieve Rostaq but he was 'leoerte^ his followers, the desorters being led by the Shaikh of Baralmi. As long as the question was one of drawing rations and coney the Sultan had a numerous and eager army but on the approach of fighting ho was left with only a hand ful of his own immediate adherents. lils Highness was thus obliged to give up all hope of relieving his cousin and the fort capitulated on tense after a ofeige of 5 months. It’s fall was a severe blow to the prestige of the Sultan who thus lost the last fortified place in the interior which was well disposed to him while | i it’s possession opened up a new spuere of influence to the rebel party. Halyyid Taimur had been anxious to obtain the assist ance of British troops in the autumn and had previously anxs asked whether, if he could raise a force of rone £Cn 0 or 3000 * en the Government would assist him in attacking his ©ne; y. Indeed he had not been anxious to move without such help but circumstances and the importunity of those around him had led him to take action which in its result showed his absolute helplessness to meet alone the situation in which he was x^laced. to the Deputy Pol.Resit In the month of May tae Political Agent forwarded a scheme for the better Government of Oman and for the provision of a force for the Sultan by means of which order could bo obtained. The main features of the present situation sure as follows: The rebels, who cay fairly claim to have caused a revolution rather than to have raised a rebellion,are in complete control of the interior of Oman and it is only the and the presence of His Majesty’s Ships existence of the Indian Regiment at Muttra which prevents them extending that control to Muscat and the rest of the coast line of Oman. They iiave never acknowledged the present Sultan whose di^ilty they consider to be,under .the rules of their religious constitution, an elective andV not a hereditary position* The movoaent, though partly due to tho objection of the Kinawie to the present branch of the Abu Said family is also due to 3 generations of bad and reak rule This condition of affairs the present Sultan has eh 'jvr. no sign of desiring to improve. Y7hile the Government of the Xaas ic making obvious efforts to rule well according to their lights and every attempt is cade to enforce Just ice.in his Highness* country tne complaints which are cade have only too much foundation as will be seen frora the notes on his Administration. The OL-anis and tue people of the coast hold the British Government responsible for his bad rule since,so they say t if it v;cre not for tills support they would not be ob liged to undergo it. The Sultan is now so absolutely dependent upon us that an unvarnished exposition of the situation to him would leave bin no alternative but to reform were that made a con dition of our continued support of hie. owing to txie lack of officials referred to elsewhere there would appear to be no alternative to the employment of British trained officials in the re-organisation of his system. Administration of His Highness.the Sultan. As stated above ms Highness administration leaves much to be desired though he has cade considerable improve ment in the disposal of cases of British subjects. Uhforjunatoly such improvement is only maintained under continual pressure for the whole system is at fault His Highness has no Wa^lr and no minister of any kind. It is obviously impossible for him to do all the work ! himself and he does not appear to understand that a stLte requires oor.ewi.at more organisation than that which is sufficient for the village of a small Arab Shaikh. For nany years trie Sultans have been obliged,owing to the to the ignorance and want of education of the native material at their disposal, to use Indians for the controlof the CuetodB ani for Secretarial work connected with finance and with India, and it is tills difficulty which makes it practically impossible to suggest any method of improvement from within the more ao since those who might assist him to rule on purely Arab lines are opposed to his very existence in any form of authority. His Walls in the districts, most of them members of tne ruling family,are unreliable and their rule Is bad. There has been some trouble at Khaburah owing to fch the fact that the Wall had been charging illegal lues and had misappropriated money which he had received on behalf of British subjects. The Sultan has righted the complaints for the moment and should they recur application will be made for the Wall to be removed.His Highness considers him.one of Ms best men. The outstanding question of His Highness administra tion is his indebtedness wMch amounts to at least 5 lakhs of Rupees. Saiyyid Taimur keeps no accounts and as his aaa receipts an:! expenditure are never balanced he has no idea of what he is spending. Thus Ms debts increase steadily and unless some reforms are made bankruptcy is the Inevitable result* indeed the terms upon wMch lie is now borrowing show that such a condition cannot be far off. His cheques are not accepted unless drawn upon or guarranteed by the Customs and they are usually only accepted at a discount of 40 per cent on their face value. Moharjaed Fuad, a Turk who was employed by Ms Mghn ness in the training of his Nizam and who nad been for some years been objected to was dismissed on the demand of the Political Agent. After failing to get permission to remain at at Basra or pi'oceed to Baghdad he was on Ms return to KaracM arrested and interned. Similarly one L'ohasimed Tahnoon His Highness Agent at Linga had been for some years the subject of adverse comment and txs of representations to His Hlgimess. At the requept^of the Political Agent he was dismissed and replaced C*9 *- » &lt; *v T^9 J ‘' --4^ Customs © The Customs Department in Muscat and Muttra continued throughout the year under the charge of the Superintendent Mr# Mahomed Reimoo an Aghakhani Khoja and a British Indian subject who has for many years done busViness in Gwadur, where he has amassed some fortune# He has also been, and is still, the farmer of the Gwadur Customs on behalf of His Highness# Mahomed Reiraoo has considerably improved the manage ment of the Customs Department in keeping definite records but the system by which the Customs is the Sultan*s Bank still continues with the result that the administration is steeped in debt and for the Spring and Monsoon months can only con tinue by borrowing money from local merchants in oi*der to pay the family pensions and other charges with which it is burdened The Customs Superintendent is able to make use of his position to benefit himself in his trade# Under the Treaty of 1891 with Great Britain only 5 per cent import tax can be charged but the charge is made in dollars at a fixed rateof exchange consequently with the appre -dated value of the dollar British s'ubjects have been paying in actual fact as much as 8 per cent though nominally paying but 5 per cent# The Sur Customs, which should give big returns to His Highness, has been brought under the Muscat control but owing to the system of exemption^ ^local fraud and limited authority of the Sultan over that part of the country a tithe IS only of the revenues which he should receive are ever paid into his coffers# The Customs at the smaller ports are still farmed# Arms, Traffic* No case of Arms Traffic of any importance was re ported during the year.

The crew of the Refrigerator consisting of 7 men were brought off by two friendly Arabs and after travelling for a week across co\mtry obtained a dhow and were finally landed at Muscat, but the barge and all it contained was looted by the Bedouins.

A certain number of children are brought over from Mekran and sold on the Batineh coast or in the interior of Oman* On no occasion has it been possible to prove a case or to catch an offender but the trade continuos. While it is reported that the children are kidnapped the Sultan states that it is the parents and guardians in Meitran who sell them and encourage the traffic, only individual cases continue to be heard of which makes the trade the more difficult to track but it is hoped that it will be possible to discover the persons who make a practice of bringing children and thus to put an end to their methods. Trade* Trade for the year was, as might be expected, bad* The imports in the normal year amount to Rb* 42,00,000 and the exports to He.40,00,000* The imports for this year totalled Rs.29,60,629 and the exports Rs.31,45,108. IJapanese goods continue to increase^in number in local market* Exports of dried and salted fish shark fins and ray for Colombo, Hongkong and Zanzibar showed a considerable increase as did local woven cotton goods puggries, shirts and shawls for Zanzibar and Adon* in September owing to the necessities of his revenues His Highness removed the prohibition of trade with tne interior and dates outward and rice etc inward moved without rostriotion. With the price of silver and the demand for dollars the price of the llaria Theresa rose to an extraordinary height ^ and caused considerable difficulties to merchants. At the opening I of the year the exchange rate was Rb. 170/- to the 100 dollars. In Hay it was Re.180/- and it was reported that with the date season it would touch Rs.200/- a rate which was considered prohi bitive. By July it was Rs.212/- and at the close of the year reached Re.255/- making living an imposeibility for those of the poorer classes paid in rupees. It wv? found necessary to give a compensation rate to the menial establishment of the political Menoy to enable them to exist. French Interests. The number of Sur dhows flying the French flag is now reduced to 6. There is but one French subject at Muscat an Algeri in Jew turned Mohammedan an ex arm dealer by name Ibrahim Elbaz or Guegyer. On the 16th July a Japanese ship the 'Yeifuke Maru' chartered by the French Government with 1200 Aamanese labour corps on board and some 30 French troops under a French Captain and Doctor bound from Saigon for Marseilles via Colombo and Djibouti arrived at Muscat. Ghe had been unable to make Djibouti in the mansoon and arrived at Muscat with no water and but a few tons of coal left. Owing to the sanitary conditions on the ship and fearing an epidemic the Political Agent decided to have the troops | landed. The French Consul agreed and a camp was pitched by the3rd B«ahmtm8 at Darsait 3 miles from kuscat where the French troops were accomodated till the arrival of a French ship •ka Loire' on the 28th July.

Trade. Trade for the year was, as night be expected, bad. The imports in the normal year amount to Ks.42,00,000 and the exports to he.40,00,000.

V/ith the price of silver and the demand for dollars the price of the Haria Theresa rose to an extr?iordinary height and caused considerable difficulties to merchants. At the opening of the year the exchange rate was He.170/- to the 100 dollars. In Hay it was Hs.lBO/- and it was reported that with the date season it would touch Es.300/- a rate which was considered prohi bitive.

The Senior Medical Officer Bait-el-Falaj officiated in charge of the Agency and Telegraph Staff. Mr. Siddiq Paean vacated the poet of Dragoman on appointment as Indian Assistant at Bahrein in April. He was relieved by Mr. JShtasham ed douleh. Sub-Ase ietant Surgeon J.P.Mascarenhas remain- £ -ed in charge of the Hospital. Owing to the difficfety of find- -ing any one willing to come to Muscat it was found impossible to relieve him during the year. Monsieur Jeannier who had been French Consul in Muscat for nearly 8 years died in September. Monsieur •vc Mateudi the Warrant Officer in charge of the French coal godow officiated as French Consul till the end of the year. Shaikh Abdul Aziz er Ruwahi continued as Dragoman. He was absent for some time on his properties in the Wadi luawal. CONDITION OF COUNTRY. At the close of the year 1917 the Omani national party under their elected Oman were in complete control of the whole of Oman proper Shaikh Masir bin Rashid brother of the Imam having been .made Wali of the newly cor- -quered Fort and area of Rostaq^the Sultan ruling on the Coast line where he could receive the protection of British support ji'v ■&gt; k. There were constant rumours of differences between the Omani leaders for which there was possibly ground but such differences do not affect their general policy or the stability of their alliance. Early in the war probably in 1914 the Imam Salim bin Rashid el Kharusi wrote to the Imam Yahya and to Said Pasha in Yemen asking them for assistance. In 1916 he agt- wrotewrote to Y«« n a^yirg that he had written the previoue letter but that as, accordirg to Oman custom the letter h«*d not been signed or sealed, it perhaps had not been taken as authentic. It is the Omani custom to state who is writing the letter but to put no seal.indeed seals are possessed by few people* In 1917 an answer w^s received by the Imam and he gave out that he was expecting the arrival of 10.000 pen from the Turks in Yemen, who it was stated wer* to come by sea. Three messengers,from Yemen apparently, in Oman travelled' by way of kokalla and bur. In liaroh it was reported that 3 Turkish Agents were travelling in Oman trying to stir up the Omanis to attack the British. It was stated that the leaders of Oman had no desire to come to ^t^ith^Briti^I^^ i« presumed ,these were the same people A it is certain that the arrival of their 10,000 men would be awaited. In the same month Syed fcadir in the absence of the Sultan at Bhofar arrested four men from the interior who had come down to Muscat. Two of these men were connec- -tions of Shaikh Isa bin Salih and constant efforts have been made to induce the Sultan to release them. The Political Agent was approached in this reference also but refused to intervene as Shaikh Isa had not agreed to meet him to dis- •cuss mutters* Shaikh lea bin Salih and four headmen of the Hurth ( tribe of el Harithi ) wrote to the Sultan letters which were extraordinary in tone considering the terms upon which they are. The letters might almost be described aw humble• An incident of Rome gravity occurred at Sur in April. One Hamad bin Salim el Arami a man of some importance in the interior and an adherent of the Imam el Kharusi came into the town under the Khafirat or tribal responsibility of Shaikh tfasir bin Ali of the Jennebehc The WaliWa.ll on hearing of hie arrival sent pome Aekarie to bring to him both the visitor and ' Xhafir • . The man refused to come and a fracas took place in which both Hamad bin Salim and hi* Xhufir were killed as well as the Akid ( oflioer ) of the Aekw.ris *.nd one or two rcen. The condition of Sur has generally been un- -8e*t is factory His highness was obliged to put fine of dollars 7,000 or. the place or. account of the disturbances between the ihhabitante. Ke can alw*y- recover such fines as long as he has our eupport since the people of Sur depend/ upon their dhows for a living and carrot tr*de without his passport• There have been continual rumours of attacks by the Imaro on Sur, Yarkal or rarairci. There is. no doubt that the Goverment of the Imam ,founded ae it is on Mohammedan - imperialistic ideas,wishes o bring all the country it can under its sway but its power for attack was, at any rate for the moment, used up in the taking of Rostaq and a further advance was impracticable during the yenr for financial reasons. His Richness* Administration . There is little to add and nothing to take away from last year? report. Condition^ h^.ve changed but little though there i? this difference that the administra tion oi the Sultan in the Capital and in Muttra is now undoubtedly better than that of his toalis in the districts. I His Highness has on the representations of the Political Agent made some economies with regard to guards and his financial position at the end of this ye«.r i* probably nofworse than it was last year. The Sultan has Walls in the places mention- -ed below in Oman. All these places are sea ports with the exception of Boshar which is about Ik miles inland from Muscat towards the wadi Semail.

S haiC a' v The tyazi for the trial of SHBRA cases is Saleh bij Aamir Al-Tewani. Cases in the BARZAH or Sultan’s law court are tried by the following brothers of His Highness &lt;3.' Syed Hamad bin Faisal Syed Hamud bin Faisal Syed Salim bin Faisal and occasionally by Syed Badir who however like His HighnesS|usually takes cases in his own house. His Highness left for Dhofar in his Yacht the Bur-el-3ahr ' on the 5th March returning to Muscat on the / 10th April. His Brother 3yed Badir acted for hi* . 8 u.ual duri ngduring hie absence His Highness• Yacht the ' Hur-el-Bah**' was used a few times for purposes of cargo and made runs between Bombay and Bunder Abbas or Lingah thereby earning weefwl money for His Highness who however has not continued that useful employment as he considers it is below his dignity to use his Yacht for rarely the purpose. As he xuriki* usee it for any other it is a mistake on his part not to turn her into a commercial vessel and give up the name of Yacht. As stated in last year’s Administration report in May 1917 the Political Agent submitted a report embodying a sceme for the better Government of Oman and for the pro- -vision of a force for the Sultan. The question was again taken up in July 1918 and^after a conference in Simla with Sir Percy Cox the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Sir Hamilton Grant Poreign Secretar^^proposals were submitted by the Political Agent by which in*%urn for a loan of 5-fc lakhs the Sultan should agree to make improvements in his administration by instituting a proper Customs service under the control of an official selected by His Majesty’s Government, by the pro- -vision of peoper Courts of justice, by the founding of schools on modern lines and by the formation of a levy corps under the training of Uative Officers lent from India and under the supervision of a British Officer. These proposals were sanctioned by the Secretary of State in December 1918 and were agreed to by the Sultan after the close of the year. The Acting Political Resident in Baghdad then intervened and the matter is at present under the further consideration at Baghdad and by the Government of India while a suitable person to undertake the duties of Director of Customs is being obtained. The necess1c/ies of education have also been discusseddiscussed and His Highness has agreed to open a school,of modern lines. It is as yet early to apeak of roads neither the administration nor the financial condition o: Oman 'being on present line equal to such a . After the close of the year al«o- the Chiefs of Oman have, after many abortive attempts, agreed .0 ^et 1/ Political Agent and it is hoped that clear issue* n ./ framed on which the thorny question of the uovernnent ox Oman and our intervention in the matter may be definitely determined. Customs. Mohammed Raimoo remained in charge of the Customs and has put them on a more business lik'. ioQtin&amp;&gt; than they have yet obtained. He is however unable to control the Sultan, who understands no finance, with the result that His Highness continues to draw cheques at rand or a:., oun- •sequently his financies are as embarrassed as ever. The Customs returns have been good considering and il Mr. Mohammed Raimoo had no other business and were in a position to sayW to the Sultan he would be, comparatively speak- -ing, a good Customs Director. He is however a rich man with large business interests at Gwadur and Karachi and only remains 4 months of the year at Muscat, by the nature of his aX' Ci-itjA.'b uv business 4 he could not put himself in opposition to the Sultan. Arms Traffic. There has been practically no Arms Traffic. Individual/ sales may hare occurred but nothing which could come under the heading traffic. Eo purchases were made from the Arms Warehouse. British Subjects and British Interests^ 45£ British Subjects registered during the ye*r of whom 135 reside in Gwadur. The majority of British Subjects consisting of KhojasKhojas live in Muttra. These Khojas have become a double community one h*lf of them being British subjects while the other half from failure of their fathers to register have become Arab subjects. A large number of these are in law British subjects as their grandfathers were such but it has not been customary in Muscat to register them. All or nearly all now desire to become British subjects and it is a question which will require consideration ©^favourable occasion. ** It is doubtful whether vit is legal to refuse to a man the right of registration when he possesses the necessary qualifiei -cations under the law of the country to which he can claim to belong. Locally it would be convenient if the bulk of the Khoja community were British subjects and I have several times been approached on the subject by those concerned. The question of British Poet Office at Muttra has several times been but has, owing to the war, been allowed to drop. The Muttra community are now anxious to take the question up once more. The Sultan’s consent having been obtained to the erection of a lighthouse the necessary arrangements were made by the Royal Indian Marine for its erection on Muscat Island. The site has been prepared and the lighthouse was completed after the close of the year but a pipe is awaited to put it in working order. In June red leading lights for ships were installed one on the Consular Flagstaff and one on the wall of the pass behind. These lights have a bearing of U‘7 S 25'k British Troops in Oman. The 3rd Brahmans remained at Bait-el-Falaj throughout the year. The old Port, in which the officers live, was considerably improved and a verandah sanctioned to keep the Summer sun from the walls. ElectricElectric light and fane have been sanctioned for thfc officers and for the hospital* Barracks for the men made of stone and mud v.ere also coia-uenced and should be ready for the next hot weather* The Inland VSater Transport Officer was transferred in November and the barge which had been used for supplying oil to paddle boats removed. b«.\al* A Marine Transport Officer was appointed to liusca the post being taken over on the 7th dune by Engineer Lieutenant G.«.Hollin«;9, B.l.K.

The imports which normally in peace times equal Fadi.00.000 and experts Ra40.00.000 fell respectively to P.3.24,99,7£5 and P*£3,5e,978. ^ The price of dollars continued high and have proved a severe handicap to merchants who are anxious to have a fi*.d coinage of rupees instead of the fl uc tua tinged ell «jrate. - The* prices ’for the year were as follows:- January* P.3.237 per 100 dollars.

He had resided in Muscat for nearly S years without going on leave and his health had consequently become very bad, indeed he rarely left hir houie. In the course of two years he was only known to go out on 4 occasions* There are now 0 Omani dhows remaining which are entitled to fly the French Flag* American Mission* Doctor ( Miss ) Hosmon left for America on 16th February.

Climate and Health* The rainfall for the year totalled only 1.96 ** about half the average* The highest temperature was 113*2 but the test of heat in Muscat is the state of the Wet Bulb rather than the actual highest recorded temperature. An epidemic of Small Pox broke out in the beginning of March and continued until the middle of June. 89 eases were reported in Muscat and Muttra and 48 deaths. At the end of October the universal scourge of S' influensa appeared andswept through the country. In the interior of Oman especially deaths were numerous and the Imam Salim bin Rashid el Kharusi appointed a special day of prayer in the country outside Rezwa to stop its ravages. Many thousands died of the disease. Lieutena Morgan Joseph I.W.T. of 8.45 was landed suffering with influenza and died on the 6th October. Major, Political Agent and H.B.M'e Consul,c Ho..

The total volume of trade therefore remains about the same* Trade is now almost entirely concentrated In British Indian hands, and the Arab merchants of Sur are now the sole survivors of the enterprising Omani traders of former days. Even the Arab merchants of the interior are not traders in the true sense of the term, as they only buy and sell from the banians and Khojas of Muscat and Muttra who absolutely control prices and supplies. The lack of rain affected the date crop slightly, and the supply of fodder, and locally grown cereals! seriously ■seriously# The price of camels has gone down 50 % due the lack of fodder and the poverty on the Trucial Coast, caused by the stagnation in the pearl market, which has greatly diminished the demand* The slump in prices at the end of the year resulted in merchants being left with considerable stocks of rice which they had bought in anticipation of the continuance of XK&amp; high prices# There is therefore a momentary cessation of imports, holders of stocks endeavour ins up prices by artificial scarcity and so to save as much as possible of their losses* This combined wit&gt; the decreased purchasing power of the dollar due to the fal- in the exchange has reacted somewhat hardly on the pocrei classes# There has been a remarkable decline in the trade and population of Muscat during the year, at the expense of the neighbouring port of Muttra# The trade of Muscat with the cessation of the arms traffic has been confined for some time to the supply of interior Oman and the Oman coast# For this purpose Muttra is far better adopted than Muscat as it is in direct communication by caravan road with the interior and more suitable for sailing vessels# Most of Muscat is now empty and in ruins and the value of house property has greatly decreased. while the reverse is the case in Muttra* y&lt; Ichabod may well be added to the numerous names that adorn its red hot rocks# Monsieur Yadala, French Consul at Bombay arrived here on 2nd December and left with Monsieur Yvoneou on 20th December for Bombay# FRENCH INTERESTS* The affairs of the French Consulate and Coal Depot have been wound up and the depot leased to H.B.M’s Government form 1st January 1921 for the period of a year# AmericanRev.

The agreement, is the events of the year showed, had jiven ^reat satisfaction to the tribes anu the tribi-1 leaders, the Imam and Sheikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi, who assured as last of non-int rference from the Sultan, and having attained in their ov/n eyes complete independence, occupied themselves entirely v/ith v their o-n affairs, Frredom of intercourse was reestablished, subjects of the Sultan who last , year would not have dared risk their lives in the interior travelled with safety in Oman, 'Onanis came down to the coast Either to ho on tire Kaj or to visit their properties in ■ W'' Zanzibar, and even the Politics! A^ent was able to make a short tour in the ladi Maawai v/here he wi.s received with the ^reatest liospi- -tality and cordiality, xXhfcxmlxxfitfxxiixxXx&amp;ai Oman is no ruled as was Arabia in the time of the Prophet, The iuam is the supreme temporal and reliyrns head, and the tribal leaders have sv;orn allegiance to him. In actuality however there is complete tribal autonomy, and the Imam never interferes except in a tximl dispute between t&gt;.o or more trices. Should any Important point of policy hive to be decided tne tribal chiefs are summoned in conclave by the Imam, and the latter win usually ^ive his final order in accordance with the views of the stronger party3. The only law is the religious law according tl the Ibadhi dogLia administered by the Qazis, Central government there is none, and though there are so called balls in several places on behalf of the Imam, they are usually the sneilih of tne tribes* The only form of taxation is the religious 'zaicat' payable to the imam, whidh is either collected by agents of the Imam in the date season or componnded for lump sums in advance. This and the Bait-al-mal, that is various properties belonging to tne state,as e the only sources of revenue. Expenditure consists in the payment of tribal levies when they are needed by the Imam for any specific purpose, and, by far the heaviestlxsx item, the obligatory eutei-uainmene ox sheikhs end their retinues. Politically tne Imam iu.s to steer a carexul course between the great tribal factions, t.uo Hinawi and the Ghafiri. Though for the moment comparative p ace prevails, largely through the astute policy of Sheikh Isa, t ,,re ere often small faction- 1 affc.irs which need careful -u ri llia ; t-&gt; prevent 'u ir ^velopaent into aii oas tribal v.-arfare, i’ne position of tne laam in such a constitution is botn delicate and s unsafe, of t..is, as ne cannot fail to be from the history oi hie predecessors, ne is perfectly well aware* a&lt;- tn era fore endeavours to please both parties, ~nd never .. ives a decision if he can possibly avoid doin d so.

To ain Ouan owes its inaopendence and t e i .an hi a. ejection. Though little is known of him, he is 'unquestionably i fone of tx.e uost rei.arnable figures in coiit^iaj Arabian history. In religion natters, in contradistinc- -tion to the rule of the late I.iam, toleration is tix-e policy, and the i.iutavnva jarty tnou^h still exercising jreat influence, has ueclined In pover. In txie ovvix^ient of the interior the chief event of the year sas the effort of the Imam and Sheikh Isa to brin^ to book the nurxerer ox the late Liam.

Stern threats of punishment were made against trie- and several ox sheikhs were imprisoned. *xs the murderer had by this time escaped to Trucial Gian, nothing however could be done, and the af„air died down. Oman opinion held that the I iam lx d mismanaged it, as much by the needless expense ho had incurred as by his failure. An attempt was made by the Imam in August go include txie Bani Bat t ash and tneir cuntry in his sphere of government, and a /ali and baxi *. ere despatched to the tribe.

The adhesion of the Sultan t,o the Arms Traffic Convention at the beginning of the year removed this final difficulty, and the disbandment of the Sistan levies provided a suitable moment and field for recruitment* ^ % On the/^ April a force of 250 men of all ranks, all recruited from the Sistan levies and under the command of Captain E.D.McCarthy, a former Sistan Levy officer arrived in Muscat from Sistan via Karachi* For the first two months of their stay they were cantonned in ..atayah, about four miles iron Bait-aiFalaj, and on x.he departure of the 2/35th Sikiis on the 28th June moved into the detachment’s quarters at the latter p^-ce. The Levy Corps has been the very greatest success. The men are . ell disciplined and adequately supplied with machine guns. They have adapted themselves to their 4 Surroundings and their health n. s on the whole been good* The . interior economy of the corps is admirable* During the last three months of tie year an attempt, which proved remarkably successful was made to recruit the local Arab or Baiuch as replacements* borne sixty h-ve now been enrolled, and so promising are they that it is hop d gradually to replace tne Sistanis by an entirely local force. The very greatest credit is due to?

They have proved exceedingly useful, amd have been put in charge of the Oo-.m.meant of the Levy Corps. Detaclnents of the Levy Corps visited Khasab and Masnaah, and this visible sign of the strength of the Muscat Government has been of great value. (dj Lisceilqneous The town of Lwadur, the bultan's possession on the ^ekran coast, and which had previously been administered by him as a private estate, was in harc?i brought under the control of the Council of Minister-* and its revenues credited to the central treasury at muscat* The Customs administration has been success^ —ful &gt; but there have been a considerable number of complaints from merchants as to tne aosence of security in tne town. The uawisssness of imekran and - the severe famine are probsbly more responsible for this state of affairs than tne i uscat administrationThe Council of Ministers were unfortunately unable to make arrangements during the year for taking over the direct administration of the province of Sohar, which continued to he administered semi-independently by Saiyiu Hamad bin Faisal^ It is to be hoped that they will be able to do this at an early date, as the revenue to be derived from Sohar is con siderable • The administration of justice in tho hands of Sheikh Zubeir continued satisfactory* No attempt was however made to advance education. The departure of Abdul Salam Fffendi Ghanem, the Directoi of Customs, for Egypt on the termination of his contract with the Muscat Government, had been a considerable blow to the administration. His great powers of organization and his re markable energy were invalu ble. It is very largely due to him directly tht the finances of the state have shown such improvement• His place has been taken by Saiyid Abu Salih, an Indian who has been long in the service of the state. ARMS TRAFFIC. There has been no arms traffic. No purchases were made from the Arms Warehouse. BRITISH SUBJECTS AND BRITISH INTERESTS, 090 British subjects were registered during the year of whom 133 were from Gwadur. The total amount of fees collected Including fines was Rs.39V'* BRITISH TROOP S. The l/HVth Mahr&amp;tt&amp;s were relieved by the 2/35th Sikhs from India on 20th January. The latter left for India on 2Sth $»» # wJtUi£*BU|H? 3 r« . June, since when there have been no British troops in Oman. SLAVE-TRADE. A somewhat alarming increase in the slave trade occurred during the year, in the form of the running of Baluchis in dhowsdh^ws from the Mekran coast to such places as Dibba and Kalba TRADE. to the north of the Batlnah coast, from whence they were taken by land to Trucial Oman and sold. The Sultan's Government, especially in Sohar, displayed considerable dillfcgence in hunting out the slaves and slave runners when they enbfered their Jurisdiction, and the Omani chiefs also cooperated. The slave runners made the country round Khor Fakkan which is out side the Sultan's territory their chief landing place, and there is no doubt that Baraimi and Trucial Oaan afce the chief markets. The general lawlessness in Mekran and the uncontrolled power of the sardars, combined with an unprecedented famine accounted for this state of affairs. The sardars make a large income by shipping slaves, and many Baluchis driven by the famine to the Arabian cost in search of work^jdecoyed into the interior. A contributory casae was the long absence of H.M* s ships from the Gulf of Oman. Their more frequent appearance in the latter half of the year had an excellent effect. 4^ slaves took refuge in the Consulate of whom 38 wrse manumitted. The price of dollars fell somewhat during the year due to the low price of silver. The average monthly rates were Rs. January February March April May June July August September October November December per 1^0 dollars 178.2 ' 182.4 ' 179 ' 180.5 ' 194 ' 194.9 ' 192.4 ' 189.3 ' 188 ' 183 « n n H If « M N W n n n n w H I ft ft n n n For the year ending 3»st March 1921 Imports, for Muscat 1and Muttra only, amounted to Rs.37,31,04c and exports to Rs. 44,95,423 as compared to Rs.39,11 ,280 and Rs.47,22,765 last year. The slump in trade and the fall in prices to which re ference was made in last year* s report were very severely felt during the year unfcer report. An effort was made by im porters to keep the price of rice artificially high to cover their losses. Prices on the whole showed a downward tendency Trade in Muscat itself is howewer decreasing as the port no longer exists as a distributing centre for anywhere except Oman. The date harvest was scarcely up to the average. FRENCH INTERESTS. The French Coal Depot was leased by His Majesty’s Go vernment throughout the year. Towards the end of the year the French Government renounced their rights in it to His Highness the Sultan who thereupon regranted the use of the site to the British Government. Monsieur Ibrahim Elbaz, the only French subject, who was supposed to have left Muscat for good, suddenly returned in June and Immediately became involved in a succession of dis putes with the Sultan’s government and with British subjects. The fact that French interests are in charge of the French Consul at Bombay, who alone therefore can deal with M.Elbaz, makes settlement a somewhat difficult matter. AMERICAN MISSION. The Rev.G. Van Peursem of the American Arabian Mission left for Sur, Dalhat, Daghmarand and Quryat and returned on t' 3 t 6 th January. i udss Lutton left for India en routg to Australia on 9th March. Dr. Kosman left for India on 19th May and returned on 29t | August. CLIMATEnr.T^ATE &amp; HEALTH. In the first half of the year malaria and bronchitis raged with unabated vigour and the season was universally spoken of as the most unhealthy within meniory# In September an epidemic of cholera broke out both at Muscat and Muttra and lasted till the middle of October. The total number of cases were 144 with 94 deaths. NAVY . The following ships visited the port during the year H.M.S.

His Britannic Majesty* a Consul and Political Agent remained in charge of French and American interests, RULING FAMILY. His highness the Sultan, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, C.S.I., was in residence at Muscat from the beginning of the year till 11th April when he left for Dhofar in ll.M. 8 . Triad. He remained there till the end of the year, Saiyid Said eldest non of His Highness and Heir Apparent of Muscat State who Joined the '.ayo Collegeat AJraereAjmer© in 1922 continued to fce well reported on by the College Authorities, Accompanied by his tutor Khan Bahadur Siddiq Hasan he paid short visits to iiuscat during the summer and winter vacations, TH ; C OUHCIL 0&gt;’ The composition of tvie Council of Ministers remained the same as last year. It functions with delatorinei and during the absence of His Highness to Dhofar found a new ■ excuse for procrastination by reserving decisions in import- -ant matters pending his return. Saiyid Nadir the President when remonstrated with averred that it was impossible for th&lt; Councl to arrive at a unanimous decision as the second member, the member for Finance, invariably opposed any suggestion he made and the third member, the Minister of Religion, was too old to do any work. The fourth member, the Minister of Justice, not being an Arab is treated by the other three as a nonent/ity, but has to be tolerated by them as he is the only one who can read or write. The Council cannot be said to be entirely satis -factory but is posnibly the best vehicle of Government for the time being, FINANCES. Captain E.D. McCarthy, I.A., was appointed by His Highness to be Financial Adviser to the Muscat Government from lot January in addition to his duties as Commandant of the Muscat Infantry, He was transferred to India in February and was succeeded by Lieut, 11. G. Alban, Indian Army who remained in charge till the end of the year. In spite of the efforts of the Financial Adviser it appeared as the year wore on that it would only 1 M a matter of time before the State went bankrupt unless Cu*t&lt; dues were raised or new sources of revenue found. The causes of the inability of the revenue to me&lt; the expenditure are briefly decline in trade, higher cost o: administrationadministration and in some cases peculation by offictfi^s. The last two have receded the serious attention of the Financial Adviser and much process has been made in economy and purification of the administration. The decline in trad, is a very different matter and appears almost inevitable in itB occurrence. Of course it must be remembered that the State now pays for its own protection in the form of a local Corps whe,, _ a « foim erly an Indian regiment maintained by the Government ^ of India was stationed at Beit-el-;'alaj. In order to meet the deficiency in revenue, temporarily at any rate, various new minor taxes have been | instituted and a change in the method of collecting the date j revenue (Zahat ) is contemplated but it is feared no real j financial security can be felt until the Customs duties, which after all are the main sources of revenue, are increas. .ed. The Financial Adviser is very active in the reform of « Customs Administration and has made several tours to the tutj .lying Customs Houses but it seems fairly clear that until a suitable sea-going vessel is procured by the State adequate supervision is a matter of extreme difficulty. Negotiations I are being opened for the purchase of a steam tug capable ef I putting to sea in almost any weather and it is hoped that this will boItc the difficulty. in the Autumn Abu Saleh the Indian Director-General. of Customs was found unsatisfactory and dismissed being repV -ed hy Mr. Sikander an Egyptian. ^ TRIBES The attitude of the B eni Bu All remained unchnged. | Although they were not actively hostile to the Muscat 5 Government, they lost no chance of pursuing their claim t. | independence and continued writing letters to the Agency on the subject. Their contentions were not treated seriously and it is hoped that in time they will settle down.remained peaceful and gare no trouble during the ye Tribal disputes resulting in murders occurred between the Bani Jawabir and the Ban! Wahaib at Kuwi and Wataiyah and threatened to develop into regular feuda- The Muscat Government were fortunately in a position to take strong action and put an end to the trouble by imprisoning the leaders of both aides* During the early part of the year 3ur was in a state of disturbance for some time, several tribal murders ^ having occurred among the Aramah and Mokhanna tribes and smuggling was on the increase. In June Sheikh Kaoliid, Minister of Religious Affairs, accompanied by Saiyid aiahab, brother of Uis highness, visited-Sur and endeavoured to settle the tribal disputes but their efforts wore in vain. In July Mr. Zuber one of the Ministers of the Council accompanied by Captain Alban Financial Adviser and 150 men of the Muscat Infantry with machine guns left for 3ur. They occupied the fort of Snnaiala and the tribal lenders were ; sucimoned. The dispute settled by the blood money being paid and the arrears*of Customs duty vis. $ 3400/- being surrend ered on the spot. The tribes were also fined 0 4000/- for their misbehaviour* a: . Mohomed bin Abdullah al Khallli continued in the position of Imam* Sheikh lea bin Saleh remained as the Chief oj th tribesmen. In July Sheikh Khalfan bftvSanaiyan, Sheikh of Nakhal was treacherously murdered and the Imam was alleged to have been concerned in it* The affair looked like producing serious complications in Oman but the situation was saved by the timely arrival at Nakhal of Sheikh Isa bil Saleh who was able to effect a settlement* Arms Traffic*(§)■&gt;' ahus thafvic.

T^e Jedouin sold them for Rs 820 and Rs 850 respectively. T^e Shaikh of Yunkul heard of their plight and money was advanced from the Muscat State Treasury to ransom them.

The ./all was perpetually asking the Council of M nisters to increase the nurader if his sepoys and made other heavy demands on the pudlic purse, alleging that the anarchy there was due to his weakness in armed men. - L 1 J 1 ^ W 1 O V The true cause was that he was a dad Governor and unpopular. fa* . „ . . • 4 . 4. Owing to the dscd government and the dapd handling of a civil suit detween some Arads and a Hindu firm over a transaction involving the sale if dates , the Arads concerned kidnapped a Irf^jwin cook delonging to the ^ -Ns , .

This master is still outstanding and the new Wali, Sayid 'Hamad din Hilal , has deen dirested to recover the money from the Arad concerned. It is however unlikely this can de done until His Highness’s authority is more firmly estadlished at Sur. • *j• r. v . • p - J- . -w * s In Septemder serious troudle arose detween the Wali at Suwaiq and ta tr izl ■ ■ local tride - the Yal Said. The Wali , Saiyid Hamad din Idrahim yirstiad earned a dad name for highhandedness in his dealings with .the tride. A climax was reached dy his doming the dhow of the Shaikh of the tride.\ This led to a fight and the Wall was forced to seek refuge in his Foi, k Shaikh Rashid Mn Jlzaiz , the Minister for Religion , was sent to settle • ■ ‘ &gt;N s the dispute , which he succeeded in doing , dut it was found necessary to S dismiss the Wall . Affairs inOman During last hot weather the Amir of Hassa , who is a deputy t Governor of Idn Saud , sent It representative to the laraimd r tract in Omano This representative collected ' Zakat H a Government ta fe. .l &lt; r y^ k from certain villages on dehalf of Ilin Saud. Eventually he found too Qianannl feeling antagonistical and he left the hinterland of the Trucial coast and returned to Hassa. This visit appears to have aroused the fears of the Trucial Coast chiefs ■,■»&gt;&gt; -frfrtrr of Adu Dhadi and Dudai , and the latter nephews Shaikh sent tv^o of his &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; to Kal^il in Sharkiyah ( south of Mus- - cat ) to get in touch with Isa Tiin Saleh , the most influential Shaikh af the M^jScat hinterland. &lt; ^ Tvi e danger threatening Oman from I'dn Saud was discussed^ and there is little ioulit that Sulaiman el Jar uni , the Tripoli agitator, who was spending the hot weather with Isa Jin Saleh,took aLading part in the deliberations. T^is Sulaiman el Jaruni has given doth the French and the Italians a great deal of troudle in past years , and was in fact detained as a political detenu by the French iyjparis until about 18 months ago. As he was not permitted by either of these Governments to go back to any place on the Mediateranean seaboard of Africa he came to Arabia, visited Mecca / and then came on to Muscat. He is a religious leader of the Adadi ^/fthich sect is strongest in 0„an. During his stay at lJuscat His Highness decorated hia with the Order of Sayidiya . T h e result of the deliberations was that it was decided to weld together the 0“ani tribes against Ibn Saud and to force those tribes suspected of Wahabi leanings ( and therefcr e of friendlin^y to Ibn Saud ; to coaply wi&gt;th the wishes of the majority of the Oman tribes. r Accordingly in November Isa bin Saleh in conjunction with the Imamof^&gt;*ian , who is in reality a mere figurehead and a puppet inthe hands of Isa din Saleh , collected their forces and marched northwards into the district of Oman known as the Dhahira. T^ere are two main political factions in Oman , the Hinawi and the (ihafiri , and the Ghafiri tribesmen were suspected of leanings towards Idn Saud . Isa bin Saleh section is Hinawi. Before he set out on his march Isa bin Saleh succeeded in attaching to i himself a powerful young Shaikh of the Ghafirm faction , one Sulaiman din Hamiyar , whose territory lies around Jadal Akhdar. AL^went well for some weeks with Isa din Saleh’s plans ; and several places in the Dhahira acknowledged the supremacy of the Imam , or ; in othr words, of Isa din Saleh. Leading Shaikhs , such as the Shaikh of Yunkul and of the A1 Naim tride of Dhank and south of Barairai were summoned to meet him and prepared to pay their respects. An important Shaikh , the Shaikh of Idri , surrendered his town and fort at the persuasion of his fellow Ghafiri Shaikh , Shaikh Sulaiman din Hamiyar. T*”e latter promised that the surrender should de^only for four days whe n the fort and town would de handed dack. As this was not done on the fixed period expiring , the Shaikh of Idri updraided Sulaiman din Hamiyar . T e latter went to Isa din Saleh and demanded that he^keep his'promise and hand back the fort. A quarrel ensued and Shaikh Sulaiman left Isa din Saleh , taking away his fighting men with him. This defection had an instantaneous effect on Isa din Saleh's schemes, beat which immediately collapsed . He wastorced to a hasty retreat dack to Kabil in Sharkhiya , and the Ghafiri Shaikhs who were on their way to 7&gt;? u- r to him , immediately returned to their homes. It is quite clear that if Idn Saud wishes to invade Oman there is no one who could make any stand against him. It is generally believed that Ibn Saud is pro- British , or rather that the British support ibn Saud. Hence Slairaan el Baruni's intrigues in this matter as he always takes the side of the anti- Europeans. El Baruni has been corresponding with Egyptian newspapers regularly since his entering the hinterland , and the burden of his reports is A to the effect that the British Government , Ibn Saud,and H. H. the Sultan of Muscat have made a secret treaty by which Idn Saud gets the hinterlandt of Oman , while the Sritish take the port of Dubai. It is not quite clear what h. H. the Sultan of M u scat is to get out of this secret pact. Arms Traffic As in draft. Slare trade. As in draft.

Major G.P.Murphy, I.A. held charge of the Political Agency and Consulate from the 1st January to 14th June when he was relieved by Major T.C.Fowle, C.B.ii., who con- tinned to hold charge of the Agency and Consulate till the end of the year. 2. The post of Agency Surgeon was held throughout the year by Captain D.L.Macicay, I.il.D. and that of Sub-Assistant | Surgeon by Mr. G.B.Yemkanmardi. 3. The post of Treasury Officer was held by the following officers during the years** Mr. M.A.Fernandez, M.B.E. from 1st January to 30th June. Mr. L.C.deSouza from 1st July to 4th November. Mr. T.M.Nicholas from 5th to 16th November. Mr. M.J.Gazdar, M.2.X. from 17th November till the end of the year. AGENCY HOSPITAL. 4. The Hospital grows in popularity despite the fact that there are two hospitals maintained by the American issionaries. In addition to the local inhabitants of .lUscat and &amp;atrah the hospital is much used by Arabs from the interior. During the year 8311 outdoor and 125 indoor patients were treated, shoeing an increase of 897 outdoor and 41 indoor patients over 1929, and 21 major and 683 minor operations were performed. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SANITATION. 5. There were no fpidemios during the year. Local sanitation is bad. Tanks for the storage of drinking water drawn from wells afford ample breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Mosquito larvae are conveyed into2 y\ the town and continue their cycle of breeding in open \ earthernware pots v,here water is stored for domestic use. It is hoped that in the course of time by educating the public in anti^mosquito measures, and in sanitation, the Council of Ministers will be able to improve the general health of the town. FCaSIGN CONSULATES. 6 . The French Consulate remained closed during the year but a watchman remains in charge. 7. The political Agent remained in charge of American interests. RULING FAMILY. 8 . His Highness the Sultan accompanied by ?£r. B.S. Thomas left for Dhofar on 2nd January in the State gunboat H A1 Saidi' and returned to Muscat on 4th March also on board 'A1 Saidi*. 9. His Highness left for Dehra Dun on 2ist March and remained absent till the end of the year. 10. His Highness has informed the Hon’ble the Political Resident of his intention not to return to Muscat. The matter has been referred to the Government of India and remained under consideration at the end of the year. !!• Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal (his Highness* brother) tooi no active part in the state affairs throughout the year, but as noted in the xast year’s report has been present on official occasions. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. 12. The composition of the Council throughout the year was as follows:* P resi dent. Said Saiyld. the eldest son of/Highness the Sultan, occupied the post of President throughout the year.The other members werei- 13 , finance Minister * Mr. B.S.Thomas, from Ist^ ^* January to 27th December. Mr. Thomas left Muscat for Dhofar on 5th October on 6 weeks leave. The N Al Said!' left Muscat for Dhofar on the 30th November to take the Wall of Dhofar back to his post, and to bring Mr. Thomas back to his. The *A1 Saidl' returned to Muscat on the 16th December without Mr. Thomas, but with an application from him to the Council asking for one month's further leave without pay. As there is no regular communication with Dhofar which is some 600 fciles from Muscat no reply could be sent, more especially as Mr. Thomas had left Dhefar for an unknown destination. It is believed that he may be trying to cross the Ruba-al~Khali. No further news had been received from Mr.Thomas up to the end of the year. Said Saiyid performed Mr.Thofflas' duties until the 27th December until the arrival of Mr. S.B.Hedgcock, the new financial Adviser. 14. Minister of Juatioe . This post was held throughout the year by Sheikh Zubair. — * glNANCB . 15. The financial situation of the State at the close of the year, as appraised by Mr. Hedgcook, was serious, as can can be seen from the following figuresi~Due to local merchants and others •••••• Due to officials and others as Ks« pay for December •••• 43,470 Cash in hand 29,168 Net deficit Total outstanding on 31st December 1930 Various measures to deal with the financial crisis are under consideration* DISTRICTS* S u Affairs at Sur gave cause for some anxiety throughout the year until the Winter. Sur is one of the most prosperous ports in Oman and the State should derive a large revenue from it in the shape of Customs dues* (By far the largest source of State revenue is derived from such dues)* The local tribes, however, chief of whom are the Jenebeh, actually occupying the port, and the Bani Bu All - further inland • are of a somewhat truculent disposi-* tion, particularly the latter, who in the early part of the year asserted their independence of the State, and hoisted their own • or as some asserted Bin Saud*s • flag, in a small quarter of the town • Alqa - which certain of their elements occupy* Dissension amongst the Jenebeh which reduced Sur to a state of anarchy, enabled the Bani Bu All to taice sides with certain sections of the Jenebeh against others, and to interfere with the internal administration of the town* A general policy was adopted, in conjunction with the Council of Minister*, of composing the differences of the Jenebeh, so that they might form a blocJc against the intrigues of the Bani Bu All, and of inducing the latter at any rate to lower their flag in Aiqa as a mark of obedience to the State* The Hon'ble the Political Resident visited the town in August and interviewed the Jenebeh Sheikhs as well a* All bin Abdullah, the chief Sheikh of the Bani Bu All* As a result of his visit the Jenebeh promised to settle their differences and the Bani Bu All 1,16,577 19,302 1,35,879\ 5. hauled down their flag and flew that of the State. In September Said Saiyld also paid a sucoessful risit to the town during which he composed • at least temporarily - the differences of the Jenebeh # and in November the Political &lt;v^cnt xixewiae visited Sur. As a result of these personal attentions the town, , which at the beginning of the year had been in a state of anarchy, outbursts of firing being frequent, with the various quarters formed into armed and hostile camps, at the close of 1930 was entirely peaceful, a state of affairs greatly appreciated by the local inhabitants, including the British Indian Banias. It is too much to expect that this state of affairs will last indefinitely, and further steps are in contemplation towards making law, order and security in Sur a permanent, instead of an occasional, blessing. * The B atinah . The Batinah coast remained quiet during the year. 1Q * ftuug-al-Jabal. In Ifiarch surveying parties from H.JI.S. 'Ormonde M were prevented from landing at Khasab by the jneikh of that place^ Sheikh Hassan^who further refused to obey the orders of the Muscat State on the subject, cut eff supplies from the Wall of Khasab - the representative of the State - and generally adopted an openly rebellious attitude. Both in view of the local situation at Khasab itself, and still more of the general effect which the Sheikhh attitude was having on the rest of Oman, and on the Trucial Coast where something like a hostile league of Sheikhs appeared imminent, the Political Resident applied for permission to His Majesty's Government for Royal Navy sloops to assist the State in bringing the Sheikh to submission. Permission was granted and H.M.S.'Lupin' and 'Cyclamen' in company with the state gunboat 'Al Saidi', commenced operations on the 20th April. Khasab was bombarded, and later the Muscat State declared the port closed to dhow traffic. On the 5th May the Sheikh surrendered and was made a State prisoner at Muscat. A6 * new Sheikh was appointed and since then all has been quiet at Khaaab* The sucoess of the operations had an excellent effect through the rest of the State. The more satisfactory situation at Sur towards the end of the year can certainly be attributed in part to the action taJcen at Khasab. 19. Gwadur. Affairs remained normal throughout the year except for the defilement of a Khoja graveyard outside the town during the night of 4th August, which naturally caused not a little resentment amongst the local Khoja community, who are on bad terms with the local Baluchis. Representations were at once made to the Muscat State who instituted vigorous enquiries, sending over a member of the Council of Ministers to assist the mli in his investigations. The graveyard is situated some miles outside the Town in an isolated spot, the outrage might have been committed by any mischief maicer, and as was only to be expected the perpetrator was not discovered. In spite of this the Council of Ministers took drastic actions imposing a collective fine on the Baluch community and expelling one Isa Dilmurad, a local bud character -ho had been implicated in a disturbance in March 1929, (for which he had served a term of imprisonment), and who the Khojas feared would stir up further trouble against them. No further incidents occurred. In October the Political /qjent on his return from recess in Karachi too^ the opportunity to visit Gwadur where he fqunti everything tW* K vi quiet. Excluding past grievances all^they now complained of in their treatment by the Baluchis was that the latter were sometimes uncivil to them. 20. Imam's Territory . The treaty made in 1920, with the assistance of the Political Agent of that time, between the Imam and his adviser Sheikh Isa bin Saleh on the one hand and the Muscat Government on the other, still works well and friendly relations have continued between the two parties throughout the year.MISSIOKAHY flORK, 21* MisBionary activity was represented throughout the year in Muscat hy membara of the Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America i.e. Rev, Van Peursem and family* Dr.(Miss) Bosnian and Dr. Harrison and family* the last named was succeeded by Dr.Storm and family. 22. The Mission has acquired from the Muscat State on 99 years lease a large plot of ground in Matrah on which to build a hospital. There is already a woman v a hospital in Muscat under the charge of Dr. Hosmon. 23. A Mohammedan family consisting of husband and wife who were alleged to have been converted to Christianity was the subject of controversy between the Missionaries and the Muscat State during the month of December, ^hen the man died there was the question ^ of his burial but ultimately Moslem rites were performed Then arose the question of the adu (prescribed mourning) by the widow* the missionaries contending that its performance would imply renunciation of Christianity. This thorny question was finally solved by the woman returning her personal property to her late husband’s brothei^ and going into M purdah M for the prescribed period in the house of Miss Hosmon. Thisv affair was a source of some anxiety to the Political Agent who * as already noted - is also in charge of American interests* and vho had j to act as the friend and adviser of both sides who both applied to him for support. It was mainly due to the sensible attitude adopted by Sr&gt;,id Said, the President of the Council of Ministers, that the matter was amicably settled.AVIATION 31# Flying Boat* Tisited Muscat on the folio\’dnfc datesi- 1st-2nd January# 31st March-1st April. 11 th-12th April. 7th-9th, 12-15th September. 17th-20th October. 12th-16th November.

Twenty slaves took refuge at the Agency during^—i the year all of whom were manumitted after enquiry* 37. It should be noted that there is no question of the slaves - while with their masters - being kept in durance» shackled with chains etc. On the contrary they are generally used for work far removed from the houses of their masters in date gardens* pearling and so forth. This means that the great majority of the slaves have ample opportunity for leaving their masters should they wish to* and for seeking manumission at this Agency* and the fact that such manumission can be obtained is now widely known throughout the State. ^ iU^or, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul* Muscat.CONFI DE NTIAL , $ ■ £jSPin&gt; ilo. 26- S of 19S2o British Residency Sc Consulate-General, Bushire, the 20th January 1952 From The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Political Agent, Muscat, I am directed to request that you will kindly submit in triplicate your Administration Report for the year 1931 as soon as possible, and in any event to reach Bushire not later than the 1st of March to enable the Hon*ble the Political Resident to submit the full report for the sphere of the Residency before the 31st March.
