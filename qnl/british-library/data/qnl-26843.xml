THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S March Sect [E 1019/448/93] Copy No., j Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received March 6.) (No. 86.) My Lord, Bagdad, February 27, 1940. IN addition to the telegraphic reports sent at the time, I have the honour to submit to your Lordship the following general account of the Cabinet crisis which recently occurred in this country. 2. During the afternoon of Saturday, the 17th February, Nuri Said called unexpectedly at the embassy and told me that he had just come from the Regent to inform me of his intention to resign in order that the prosecution of those charged with the murder of Rustam Haidar should take place under some other Prime Minister. His difficulties of late had been considerable, but he might have carried on had it not been for their aggravation by the death of Rustam Haidar and the problem of meting out justice to those who were guilty. He would be succeeded by Rashid Ali-al-Gilani, and he gave me to understand that arrange ments for the new Cabinet were cut and dried. He himself would become Minister for Foreign Affairs aud three of the old Ministers would be dropped. Their successors had not then been finally chosen, but he forecast two with some confidence. 3. On the 18th or 19th February Nuri Said tendered his resignation (a translation of his letter to the Regent and of His Royal Highness’s reply is enclosed herein( l )); but subsequent events did not develop according to plan. 4. On the afternoon of Monday, the 19th February, I met Rashid Ali, and it was soon evident from his talk that his Cabinet^cas not so ready as Nuri Said had suggested. He spoke of one or two prominent men who, for one reason or another, would or could not join, and he was evidently still perplexed how to fill several important posts. His suggestion that Taha might occupy some other post than that of Minister of Defence seemed to me curious, and I was surprised to learn that he was not sure whether he would be ready to announce his new Cabinet by Wednesday. The resignation of the previous Cabinet was to be published on the Tuesday, and Nuri Pasha had evidently contemplated the almost simultaneous announcement of its successor. 5. The next day, Tuesday, complications developed rapidly. It is difficult to establish the precise sequence of events, but it seems that General Husain Fauzi. the Chief of the General Staff, and General Amin-al-Umari, the Officer Commanding the First Division, had begun in collaboration to interfere in the formation of the new Cabinet. They had meetings with a number of officers, represented their views to men with whom Rashid Ali was in touch concerning their joining the new Cabinet, and expressed to Rashid Ali their objections to a Cabinet m which either Taha-al-Hashimi or Nuri Said was included Husain Fauzi refused to serve any longer under Taha on the ground that this Minister, in usurpation of the functions of the Chief of Staff and for political motives, saw too much of the subordinate officers; Amin-al-Umari no doubt realised that his days under Nuri were numbered, and wished, therefore, to eliminate Nuri. Rashid Ali thereupon threw in his hand. The Chief of Staff on behalf of Amin-al-Umari and himself, then repeated his intervention with the Regent at a time when Nun happened also to he in the Palace Probably on Nun’s advice, though it may also have been on that of his own aide-de-camp the Regent thereupon summoned a number of other officers to the Palace and spent most of that night in eliciting their views. They all repudiated the two generals and declared their loyalty to the Regent as Head of the State U the same time they expressed the fear that they would be victimised if certain persons P) Not printed. [3—60]were included in the new Cabinet. The Regent asked them to send him privately a list of these persons, which, when received later, was found to include the two Suwaidis and Jamil Madfai. Shortly afterwards the Regent informed the two generals that they had been relieved of their appointments and placed on pension. Husain Fauzi seems to have accepted the situation and returned to bis^^ private house, but there are circumstantial stories that Amin-al-Umari endeavoured to collect troops in the Washash cantonment on the right bank of the river, quite near the Regent’s Palace, for a movement against the Government. 6. Nuri Said meanwhile proceeded to another large military camp at A1 Rashid (formerly known as Hinaidi), and any mutinous intentions that officers in the Washash barracks may have entertained seem to have been abandoned when it was known that the Regent had dismissed Amin-al-Umari and the Chief of Staff. The Prime Minister has told me since that there was never real danger of serious mutiny, but in that event it is difficult to explain the condition of hysterical anxiety of his nephew (Tariq-al-Askari, eldest son of the late Jafar Pasha) when he rushed into the counsellor’s house early on the 21st February to tell an incoherent story of a night of alarums, excursions and impending coups. Troop movements and elaborate military precautions were also evident, while Nuri's own whereabouts was left shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless, whatever may be the facts of the situation in the Washash barracks during the night of the 20th—21st February, it seems clear that the rest of the army remained unaffected and that the commanders of the provincial garrisons, on receiving news of the situation in Bagdad, at once informed the Regent of their unconditional loyalty. 7. The Regent spent the morning of the 21st February in vain endeavours to find a Prime Minister. The President of the Senate, Saiyid Muhammad-al- Sadr, declined the honour, and consultations with other leading public men also failed to produce a solution of the problem. In the afternoon His Royal Highness informed me with confidence that he expected to be able to form a Cabinet of senior officials having no close connexion with any of the established political groups. The men whom he had in mind included Abdul Aziz-al-Qassab, Comptroller-General of Accounts; Ali Mumtaz, Director-General of Revenue; Musa Shabandar, Assistant Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and others holding similar positions. They could obviously have done little more than tide over the crisis, but this temporary solution was dismissed a few hours later as impracticable, amongst other reasons because Aziz-al-Qassab would have been quite inacceptable to the Shiahs. 8. An appeal was then made to Nuri. who consented to resume office as Prime Minister, and soon succeeded in forming a new Cabinet. It is very much the same as the Cabinet that Rashid Ali was expected to form, but without Rashid Ali, who remains at the Palace with much diminished prestige. Although the crisis passed without a military coup, it is apparent that the army played”a dominant part. Nevertheless, the Regent’s firmness with the two generals is encouraging, and it may be hoped that his handling of the situation will increase his political influence and strengthen his confidence in himself and his judgment. 9. The Prime Minister also emerges with an enhanced reputation, and though his difficulties have not been solved and his opponents have been neither conciliated nor dispersed, their weakness has been exposed, and Nuri’s own position is by comparison stronger and his personal popularity greater than before his resignation. He entertains the thought of filling the vacant seats in his Cabinet with men from one or other of the groups not at present represented, but it is early yet to appraise his chances of success. There are three Ministers of the last Cabinet who do not return. Of these Jalal Baban and Subhi-al- Daftan are no great loss, but I regret the absence of Ali Jaudat. He has always shown himself to be frank, helpful, and reasonable in all the dealings that I haVe had with him. and, though he has no outstanding intellectual gifts or influence he has sound common sense and little of that personal vanity that has so often tempted Iraqi Foreign Ministers to act unwisely. It is to his credit that the reason given to me by Nun for his omission was that Ali Jaudat had compromised himself by prejudging the case of Sabih Najib and Ibrahim Kemal in favour of the accused and advocating too openly their release. 10. In the new Cabinet Amin Zaki returns to his old Ministry after four years m the wilderness, and Rauf Rahrani comes back to the post which he filled for a year without distinction in Yasin-al-Hashimi’s last administration. Thetransfer of Dr. Sami Shaukat from Social Affairs to Education will probably lead to an increase of military training in the schools. He made his first appearance at the Ministry in uniform. 11. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s ^nbassador at Cairo, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, His Majesty’s High ^^mmissioner at Jerusalem, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, to the Governor- General of India, and to the combined Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo.

Court consisted of three :..ilitary Officers, one judge of Appeal and one judge of First Instance. The trial continued on March 4th and 5th and may last a week. Proceedings are being fully reported in the press. Popular opinion on the published evidence ranges from gratified conviction that it shows accused to be guilty beyond all doubt, to gleeful satisfaction that it exposes the utter absurdity of charges brought against them. Same may be said of such more enlightened opinions as have been expressed to me too. [ J R T ends].

I took the opportunity of a tete-a-tete conversation to encourage Regent in the assertion of his authority. I pointed out that the objection to effective Parliamentary control there, was obviously the danger of intervention by the army or even the tribes, such as had occurred in the past, unless he him self could intervene with authority when changes of Government became necessary. If border interventions developed, the consequences for the stability of the country might obviously be serious. I said I was very glad therefore that he had resisted this intervention in the present case and felt that, while he must be pleased, he need not be at all surprised at the expressions of loyalty and confidence which his actions had evoked. I also expressed the hope to the Regent that he would be able to take ill feeling, rancour and any tendencies to violence out of the atmosphere; and afford protection to those vacating office against unfair treatment by incomers, who would after all themselves be out- goers in due course. At the same time I informed His Royal Highness / 0 (,*r of the tenour of your telegram No. 32 and read to him the greater part /' of paragraph 4. The Regent, who had been occupied with the crisis during most of th the previous night, was tired* but evidentlv pleased with the loyalty shown to him. Actually of course the army has again inter vened and with considerable effect, seeing that in order to strengthen his hand in dealing with the initiative taken by the Chief of Staff, the Regent at Nuri Pasha's suggestion brought in other army representa tives. Moreover most of his actions were probably prompted by Nuri Pasha* I thought it well however to congratulate His Royal Highness on the result of his efforts; and I hope that one good result of the crisis may be to nromote his self-confidence and influence.

This might help him later on, if he so desired, to secure the adhesion of some of his present opponents to the Suwaidis. 2. The Prime Minister assured me that such was his intentio The Cabinet would probably remain in its present form until the L4=rcabinetj'murder case had been settled but in about three or four weeks time one of two vacancies which he had kept in the cabinet would perhaps be offered to Naji Suwaidi. Ke himself while remaining as Minister for Foreign Affairs might then be replaced as Prime Minister by Rashid or someone else. By continuing too long as Prime Minister he did not wish to give the impression of clinging to that office or having ambitions as Dictator. His subsequent remarks about Suwaidi and [? feifai-] were, however, not very flattering so I do not feel too confident that inclusion of one of them will be realized. Nor evidently did he think that Rashid had enhanced his political reputation by his timid behaviour.3-3 2, 5. I pointed the moral of conciliation by referring to your telegram No.52 and reading to Kuri Pasha the message contained in paragraph 4. He assured me of his intention to secure complete justice and impartiality for the accused and said that as the ohiahs now had more confiaence in him he was better able to withstand their demands. Trial would have to take place before IP a military court at A1 Acc-rhir camp but it would be open to public and accused would have proper legal representation. The case would take place as soon as possible and its disposal should do much to clear the atmosphere. 4. In Nuri Pasha's opinion the position of the Regent had been greatly strengthened by the crisis [grp.undec.] army had shown its complete loyalty. The Prime Minister denied circumstantial reports which have reached me that military camp at v»ashash just outside Bagdad had been on the verge of making a coup . I believe nevertheless that the situation was at one time serious.

After being informed by Hussein Fawzi Shabatz of the objection felt by him and General Amin al Umari to the inclusion of Taha or Nuri Pasha in the new Cabinet Regent on the advice of Nuri Pasha consulted other representative officers. By them His Highness was assured that the Army would loyally accept the Cabinet appointed by him v/hether it included Nuri Pasha and Taha or not. As however these officers expressed fears of being victimised if certain unspecified appointments were made Regent asked them for a list of those whom they feared and this included the Suwaidi family and Madfai. After ascertaining that Nuri Pasha and Taha were quite willing either to serve in the new Cabinet or to be omitted at his discretion Regent now proposes to leave them out and appoint a neutral Cabinet omitting most prominent politicians on either side. He had hoped that the President of Senate would be Prime Minister. The latter has declined but Meeting will take place tonight at which final appointment of the new Government may be made. Course proposed looks like a demonstration of impartiality and a stoppage-of-the-gap measure.

Fortunately/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC IRAQ. CONFIDENTIAL. MAJESTY/5 GO Febr wr 1036 iary 3, 1940. v 1540 Secwom r 4.v — j [E 498/4t8/93] Copy No. Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received February 3.) (No. 24. Confidential.) My Lord, Bay dad, January 17, 1940. IN my despatch No. 717 o f the 8th December, 1939, I described the character and strength of the Opposition which had crystaliised against the Cabinet of Nuri Said. In the concluding paragraph I said that, if he were faced with the dilemma of continuing in office or of resigning and exposing himself to the prob ability of victimisation, Nuri Said would be inclined to cling to office unduly, and his opponents, having no effective constitutional means of removing him owing to the proved inability of Parliament to upset the Government by which it had been packed, might attempt to organise yet another change of Government by force. 2. This situation appears to me to warrant an examination of how it has come about, what its essential features are and what it betokens for the future of Iraq and British imperial interests in this country. As your Lordship is aware, Iraqi politics are to an especial degree an affair of personalities and pro fessionalism. From the first the sweets of office have been the perquisite of a group of politicians, too numerous to share out Cabinet portfolios amongst them selves by agreement, yet too similar in their general political outlook to be really divided by anything save jealousy of those of their number who for the moment have secured better and more remunerative positions than the rest, and the deter mination that no particular group within their group shall enjoy a monopoly of office. The question in Iraqi politics has always been how to sort out and adjust these conflicting claims, and to ensure that all the various politicians shall have their turn in office with the minimum of inconvenience and damage to the State. It was one of the chief merits of King Feisal I that he developed a peculiar and effective technique for dealing with this problem. He kept his hand on the political pulse of the nation by maintaining contact with the various politicians, consulting them and listening to their views and making the necessary adjust ments to his Cabinets before the discontent of those out of office had time to come to a head. Inevitably there were frequent changes of Government, and the average life of Cabinets in Iraq has been no longer than nine months. But King Feisal, by his authority and his technique, was able to ensure that the changes did not take place by violent methods. With his son matters were otherwise. King Ghazi had neither the authority, personality nor capacity to do what his father had done, and he became, not the controller of political currents, but their instrument. The rival politicians began to have recourse to external factors for furthering their aims. In 1935 the Opposition fomented a revolt among the Euphrates tribes which brought down two successive Cabinets in that year. In 1936 a general staged a coup d’Ftat with the assistance of the army; in 1937 the army itself eliminated the general and removed his adherents from office. And in 1938 Nuri Said, who had remained outside the Government ever since he had been obliged to flee the country as a result of the 1936 coup d’fitat, used the army to re-establish himself in power. 3. The position, therefore, in which Iraq now finds herself is that Parlia ment as a means of effecting a smooth transition from one Government to another, has failed. The politicians have developed the habit of furthering their ambitions by extra-parliamentary methods. The army has been introduced into politics, and politics have introduced themselves into the army. There is a tendency for the various politicians to court different army cliques, and for high officers, in their turn, to develop political ambitions. It cannot with any certitude be fore seen where these tendencies will lead, but the possibility cannot be excluded that the antagonisms of the various groups, within as well as without the army, will one day sharpen, even to the point where something very much like civil war may result. [2—67]■■■■I 2 4. In this situation much, clearly, turns upon the actions and personality of the Regent. The Emir Abdul Illah starts, evidently, with certain dis advantages. He is young, comparatively inexperienced politically, and technically (as the son of the late King Ali of the Hejaz) a foreigner. But m another way, his previous detachment from Iraqi political life may be an he has ^ taken his responsibilities seriously and has a good personality. \\ hether he wil commence, or, indeed, has commenced, to take an active pa it in innueiicing faqi politics from the particular point of view of sorting out and conciliating the i iva political ambitions is not yet clear. Unless he does so it is difficult to see how the problem of effecting changes of government without force can be solved. But if he does so, he may before long place himself, or find himself placed, in the position of a virtual dictator. In such an event he may come to depend, as most dictators do, on some political or military or other faction or influence in order to maintain himself in power. And one quarter, or one of many quarters, to which he may turn for advice or assistance may well be, in view of Britain’s past association with Iraq, His Majesty’s Embassy. 5. The extent to' which, in such a contingency, the embassy should support or advise the Regent, and, generally speaking, intervene in the internal political life of Iraq, is clearly a question which cannot be answered at present, if only because it envisages a hypothetical situation, and it is not the intention of this despatch to invite your Lordship to come to a decision upon it. My intention is at present merely to present to you possibilities which underly the existing situation in order that we may turn them over in our minds and not be caught altogether unprepared should they, in fact, materialise. It will be necessary, for instance, to consider whether the trend of events is likely ultimately to place His Majesty’s Government before the alternative either of intervening in Iraq s internal affairs or of liquidating their position and commitments in Iiaq altogether, when British influence would, no doubt, in due course be replaced by that of some other foreign country, perhaps Turkey. If the political developments which I have described earlier in this despatch were to continue, they would raise the question whether, in the long run, Iraq is really capable of governing herself, and whether, if British support were removed, she would not descend a vicious spiral into an abyss of internal chaos, when she would become an easy prey to external aggression. 6. Fortunately, the issue is not immediate and may never become so. The Arabs have a fund of common sense dn the regulation of their tribal life on patriarchal rather than dictatorial lines, and if deterioration at the centre went too far this tradition might stand them in good stead and enable them to keep their political aircraft from getting into a disastrous spin. On the other hand, it may be prudent to bear these potential dangers in mind when considering our attitude towards internal political developments in Iraq and the extent of our possible intervention. The Regent, being young and inexperienced and having been placed in his present position by the Government now in power, might be well advised not to assert himself too strongly in any political crisis in the immediate future. On the other hand, should he fail to do so at some stage, perhaps after the next crisis, the situation might continue to deteriorate qptil it got out of control. 7.

Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received December 18.) (No. 717.) My Lord, Bagdad, December 8, 1939. IN my telegram No. 431 of the 23rd November, 1 reported that there were renewed signs that the present Cabinet were in difficulties. So far as can be judged at the moment of writing, these difficulties appear to have subsided and the tension to have left the atmosphere. But a crisis, and even a cony, may at any time develop, for, as an Iraqi informant who may be more impartial than most remarked to me, a change of Government may be considered due after nine months or so. and the position of the Nuri Cabinet has deteriorated since he came into power, although it is impossible to say how far it has deteriorated. It may, therefore, be useful to your Lordship to be furnished with the following broad outline of the internal political situation. 2. Opposition to the Prime Minister is apparently being conducted by two main groups. The first and perhaps the more influential is what might be called the parliamentary Opposition. It is led by Jamil Madfai and embraces the other members of the last Cabinet, several ex-Ministefs wTthliopes of office if there is a change, and the few remaining adherents of Hikmat Sulaiman. The motives of the parliamentary Opposition are a desire to hit back at Nuri Said for his coup against them last December, their natural wish to taste once more the sweets of office, and their dislike of the activities of the courts martial set up by Nuri’s regime. They seem to have no serious difference in principle with the general policy of the Government, but indict them with the familiar charges of inefficiency and corruption which are customarily cited in this country against Governments in office. Among the public this group is supported by a considerable number of officials, whose interests have been harmed by what is alleged to have been Nuri Pasha’s pursuit of personal vengeance against all who worked for his enemies and his unfair favouring of his own dependents and friends. 3. The second group is that of the Arab extremists who would like to exploit the war to obtain an amendment of the white paper policy in favour of the Arabs of Palestine and the Nationalists of Syria. This group has a number of supporters in the army and among the young intelligentsia and student classes. It works largely through the Nationalist clubs and is a profitable field for German propaganda. 4. It is difficult to say what measure of co-operation there may be between these two elements. The record of the leaders of the first group does not suggest that they really share the extreme views of the second, nor that, if they were to return to office, they would less readily fulfil the obligations of the alliance with Great Britain or be more intractable concerning Arab nationalism than Nuri Pasha and his colleagues. Nevertheless, the common opposition of these two groups to Nuri Said may possibly bring about an uneasy and ephemeral coalition to defeat the Government. There is also a danger that Jamil Madfai and his friends may be tempted to sue for the support of the extremists with pledges which it would embarrass them to have to fulfil in office. 5. The second group, the Arab extremists, lacks men of standing and seems to be looking for leaders. At one time it appeared that Sami Shaukat would fill this role, but latterly there has been an inclination for the rank and file to pin their hopes upon Taha-al-Hashimi. concerning whose differences with Nuri Said rumours have from time to time been in circulation. It will be recalled that before becoming Minister of Defence Taha-al-Hashimi was president of the Palestine Defence League. General Taha’s own attitude is uncertain. Some say that he aims at the premiership, but others, including both the Prime Minister himself and Taufiq Suwaidi of the Opposition, are emphatic that he realises that he is unfitted to form and lead a Cabinet. Possibly his purpose is limited to securing [780 s—1],2 a certain degree of support both in the army and among the political public in ol der to maintain his own position through the shifts and changes of political life. 6. Others who must be taken into account are Rashid Ali, Muhammad-al- Sadr and Maulud Mukhlis. 7. Of the first, it is said on all sides that he is ambitious to become Prime Minister. He apparently enjoys the Regent’s confidence, but would find it difficult to form a Cabinet, for few of the parliamentary Opposition would take ^ office under him. Nevertheless, as principal political adviser in the Palace, he is - in a favourable position to seize any opportunity which may occur to make a bid for power. Muhammad-al-Sadr, the President of the Senate, is believed to aspire one day to head a predominantly Shia Cabinet, but, though his name has been mentioned recently in political circles as a possible Prime Minister, the Suni effendi element is unlikely ever to accept a Shiah ’alim as Prime Minister. It is also doubtful whether Muhammad-al-Sadr could ever succeed in consolidating Shiah opinion behind him. 8. Maulud Mukhlis, the President of the Chamber, is a passionate Arab Nationalist, and though his political ineptitude and addiction to the bottle are well known, it is suggested in some quarters that the extremists are considering whether, with the support of abler and younger men, he could not be made the figure-head of a pan-Arab Government. Such a scheme is not, however, likely to appeal to many of the personalities normally counted as eligible for ministerial office. 9. Nuri Said's efforts to placate his critics have not met with much success. He has so far failed to persuade Jamil Madfai or any of his group to join the Cabinet and, in spite of his efforts on behalf of the Arabs in Palestine and the welcome given to the Mufti in Bagdad, the extremists continue to accuse him of having failed to do all that might have been done to further the Arab cause and of being too amenable to British influence. He is not, however, without supporters and, according to recent reports, his position with the army has lately improved. 10. His son Saba said recently, with some distress, that Nuri Said was showing signs of weariness. Although he was naturally tired when he dined with me on the day of his journey back from Egypt, and on other occasions he has seemed less cheerful and resilient than usual, I do not feel able from personal experience to confirm Saba’s statement. It is possible that Nuifi would willingly relinquish office for a rest if he were not afraid that he would be victimised by his enemies so soon as he ceased to be in authority. One ex-Minister who discussed the matter with a member of my staff even went so far as to say that, if Nuri Said resigned, he would be unable to stay in the country. If really faced with such a dilemma, he would, of course, be inclined to cling unduly to office, and his opponents, having no effective constitutional means of removing him owing to the proved inability of Parliament in Iraq to upset the Government, by which it has been packed, may attempt to organise yet another change of Government by force. 11.

BASIL NEWTON■ w^m f i' British Embassy, (E 8078/4342/93), . .56 l Bagdad, 1I2j:—| 13th December, 1939&lt; (164/12/39) My Lord, I With reference to my telegram No, 223 of June 16th ^ reporting the award of the Habbaniya Escape contract to Messrs, Balfour Beatty and Company, I have the honour to i^^orm Your Lordship that the contract was not actually signed until December 4th. 2, The delay was caused by the United Kingdom firm 1 s request for the insertion of a war clause, which rather surprisingly had not been included in the conditions stipulated in their tender. The Iraqi Government at first refused this request, and they maintained this attitude for more than three months. Eventually they agreed to enter into negotiations with Messrs. Balfour Beatty and Company and invited Mr. McTaggart of this firm, to come out from London and discuss the question. On two occasions the negotiations all but broke down, but the United Kingdom firn^s persistence and patience were rewarded, for they eventually obtained the protection against war risks which they desired. 3. The agreement reached provides for the signature of the contract on the understanding that if, as a result of the European war, such difficulties arise as make it impossible for the company to continue the work without undue hardship, the Iraqi Government, if satisfied after consultation/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K. G. , G. C, S. I., G. C. I. E., etc., etc., etc.consultation with the Consulting Engineers that such is the case, will consent to the suspension of the work for such time as may appear necessary. in that event the government will pay for the work done, but will be under no obligation to take over the plant and materials, and the contractors will not be liable to any penalty for the delay occasioned by the suspension* 4. The government also undertake to give sympathetic consideration to any other proposals which the contractors may make with a view to facilitating the execution of the work. The majority of the Cabinet insisted on this vague formula, although precise concessions were proposed by the contractors, as also by the British irrigation officials in order to avoid difficulties in the future. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, etc., (for the Ambassador) (Signed) W,E. Houstoun-Boswall.r / THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 644 of the 3rd November, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that the^Iebate on the Speech from the Throne, which took place on the 9th November, was mainly devoted to the situation in Palestine and Syria, and I enclose herein a report taken from the Iraq Times. 2. It will be seen that, as the result of speeches made by a number of Deputies, who raised the question of the position of Iraq in relation to the affairs of Palestine, the Prime Minister was obliged to define the attitude of his Government. 3. He based his statement on the white paper, and stressed the point that this document had the great merit of having finally banished the fear that there would ever be a dominant Zionist majority in Palestine. He then referred to the second gain for the Arabs contained in the white paper; the undertaking to set up a National Government in Palestine. He explained that there were certain points concerning this undertaking which required further elucidation, and suggested that it should not be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to meet Arab wishes in this regard. 4. After the debate Parliament was adjourned for two months, with effect from the 15th November. 5. The same evening the Prime Minister told me that a similar debate had taken place in the Senate. There he had been heavily attacked by several members of the late Cabinet. They had generally criticised the policy of the Government including what they alleged to be the extravagance of the new Ministry of Social Affairs, but had reserved their heaviest artillery for the bombardment of the Government’s policy regarding Palestine. The Prime Minister told me that he had answered his critics in the Senate with the same arguments that he had employed in the Chamber, and said that he was satisfied that he had convinced both Houses that there was more merit in the white paper than they had hitherto perceived. The difficulty, he explained to me, was that, although it had been widely published in Arabic, few had ever taken the trouble to read it, and of those few only one or two had understood its significance. 6. I asked his Excellency whether there was any particular reason why the question of Palestine should have come up for discussion at the present time when conditions there were so steadily improving. He said that the people of Iraq, as Arabs and Moslems, were naturally profoundly interested at all times in the political aspirations of their brother Arabs and Moslems in Palestine, and that in consequence the affairs of Palestine and. in recent years, the attitude of the Iraqi Government towards the struggle of the Palestinian Arabs against the menace of Jewish domination, had frequently become a subject for discussion when a general debate, such as that on the Speech from the Throne, took place in Parliament. He added that several speakers emphasised that they were not seeking to exploit the present situation, and your Lordship will observe that this point is brought out in the report on the debate which is enclosed herein. 7.

At the close, the Minister of Justice announced tnat he ha a message to deliver in the form of an Iradah. The Deputies then rose, and the Minister read an Iradah postponing the meetings of Parliament for two months from the 15th November. , . The debate began when the President announced that the day s discussions would be concerned with the draft address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. A number of well-known Deputies, including Sayid Abdul Mahdi (an ex-Mmister who represents the Muntafiq), spoke at length on Iraq s foreign relations, more particularly her position vis-a-vis the present war. Sayid Abdul Mahdi stressed that Iraq was co-operating sincerely with her ally, Great Britain, in the lulnl- ment of promises made to Britain. He went on to point out that the Allies had obligations of equal importance towards the Arabs of Syria and I alestme. Sayid Abdul Mahdi was followed by a number of Deputies, who spoke in more or less the same strain, suggesting that an end should be put to the difficulties besetting the Arabs of Palestine. Some of the speakers pointed out that the demand was not being made at the present time in an effort to take ad\ antage of the present international situation : Iraq had always been seeking a just settlement of the Palestine question in the interests of the continuance of the strong friendly relations between Iraq and Britain. His Excellency the Prime Minister (Sayid Nuri-as-Said) made an important statement in reply'to the points raised by earlier speakers. His Excellency said that what Iraq wanted was the setting up of independent States in the Arab countries, on lines similar to the independence enjoyed by Iraq herself. ^ “ We have repeatedly put our point of view before the British and French Govern ments,” he said, “and we are still doing our best for the fulfilment of our wishes.” His Excellency then gave a resume of the recent history of the Palestine negotiations. He referred to the Round Table Conference in London, and said : “ The results of our endeavours have not been wholly unsatisfactory, and we no longer fear that Palestine will become Zionist. We have now no doubt that the Arab majority in Palestine will continue to remain in control of their country.” His Excellency went on to refer to the second point raised by the previous speakers, who'had maintained that an Arab national State should be set up in Palestine. “This point,” said Sayid Nuri, “has not been made clear in the white paper, and we are now endeavouring to have it clarified, and to have the period mentioned in the white paper shortened. It is probable that certain state ments may be made which will elucidate this point and eliminate the doubts in the minds of some of us. It would not be difficult for our ally, Great Britain, after the settlement of the first problem— i.e., that of Jewish immigration—in a manner acceptable to the Arabs, to reassure them as to her intentions and then set up an independent State in Palestine.” The Prime Minister was followed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who made a statement on Iraq’s position in the present war and the sincerity with which she was fulfilling her obligations towards Great Britain and the Powers who were signatories of the Sa’adabad Pact. His Excellency expressed the gratification with which he had heard of the signing of the pacts between Turkey and Britain and Turkey and France, which would, he said, be a stabilising factor in the Near and Middle East. In the later stages of the debate a statement was made by the Minister of Finance on economic questions. He requested the Majlis to pass a draft law for the payment of 6,000 dinars by the Government of Iraq for the relief of the Arabs in Palestine. This proposal was carried, and the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne was then approved by a unanimous vote.J (240/63/39).

His Majesty’s Consul at Basra) with a view to affording me an opportunity to meet the British community. 3. The following day I visited the Royal Air Force air base for flying boats at 8aara and afterwards spent over two hours with Sir John Vard discussing many matters connected with the Port. After luncheon with him I spent another two hours in seeing the port and some of the many services connected with it. I had heard much of the efficiency with which the Port and Air Port are managed and of the up-to-date buildings and equipment which have been provided for the convenience of the shipping and aircraft calling at j^asra: what 1 saw fully equalled and in fact surpassed my expectations.

They are self- supporting and ample provision is aaue, as I was informed by Sir John Ward, for their up*«ep aud development. 4. That evening Ur. and Mrs. uriekeil gave a reception at the Consulate at which I made the acquaintance of the Consular Corps and of many Iraqi notables and senior officials. There were also present a number of compatriots with wnom 1 was able to continue the acquaintanceship begun on the previous evening at the Overseas Club. 5. On November 6th, I flew tc loweit in the morning and back to Basra in the evening In an aircraft kindly put at my disposal by the Air Officer Commanding at 3haiba. On both the outward and return journey I was thus enabled lo view from a low altitude the site of the proposed new port on the Xhor Abdullah. It lies in a wide low-lying mud bank cut up by channels formed by a long area of the sea, and the site as seen from the air suggested tc me that Port Said which I have also only seen from the air may have originally looked rather similar. In koweit, where I exchanged cal-s with His Highness the Huler, I was the guest of Major Galloway, the Political Agent, and I was also fortunate to find Colonel Prior, the newly appointed Meaident in tne Persian uuif, who was staying ht ^ the Agency.6.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 436 of the 8 th August, I have the honour to report that the parliamentary session which began on the 13th June was prorogued on the 30th October. Meetings had been resumed on the 8 th October after the adjournment on the 7th August, but the work was restricted in the main to the formal acceptance of the emergency ordinances which had been passed during the recess. 2. On the 1st November a new session was opened by the Regent with customary ceremony. The speech from the Throne (a translation of which is enclosed herein^)) opened with a reference to the declaration of war by Great Britain and France against Germany, and to Iraq’s decision to fulfil her under takings to Great Britain as an ally under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The speech went on to refer to the pleasure given in Iraq by the tripartite treaty recently concluded between Great Britain, France and Turkey, and to the wisdom of the stand made by the Arab countries in support of the principles of the liberty and independence of nations. There was no direct mention of Palestine, but the hope was expressed that the attitude adopted by the Arab States would “ constitute a strong factor in the realisation of their national ideals.” The three main points of that part of the speech which dealt with home affairs were that the strengthening of the defence forces would be continued, that measures would be taken to deal with the financial difficulties caused by the war, and that one of the tasks of the new Ministry of Social Affairs would be to make provision for the better care of the children of the country. 3 . At the first meeting of the Senate and Chamber which followed the opening of the session, the old Presidents were re-elected in both Houses, in the Senate Saiyid Muhammad-al-Sadr, and in the Chamber Saiydi Maulud Mukhlis. 4.

During the debate on the speech from the throne on November 9th, Nuri’s administration was vigorously attacked in the Senate by several members of the Cabinet which he displaced last December and their feelings towards him have been embittered by Government orders under discussion with the Press not to publish the debate. Rashid Ali is said to be trying to enlist Taha against Nuri and also m'embers of the Madfai-Taufiq Suwaidi group. Although the latter may be reluctant to co-operate with Rashid Ali, they are very hostile to Nuri. The Cabinet is not in a good position to resist an attack if made. Apart from the doubtful loyalty of Taha, Jalal Baban is disgruntled, and Nuri himself is said by his own son to have lost his grip on affairs, and to be in a nervous condition. The sense of greater security resulting from the British- French-Turkish pact will remove a restraining influence on internal political changes. The Mufti seems to have been behaving with foresight, and interest in his person to have diminished, but his arrival and the renewal or talk about Palestine are of course factors liable to enliven political movement and to encourage pan-Arabs who, in the army and elsewhere, criticised Nuri for being too pro-British. The Minister for Foreign Affairs whom I tried to draw the other day professed confidence in the stability of the Government.

October 6 , 1939. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 6827/72/93] Copy No. Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received October 6 .) (No. 561.) My Lord, Bagdad, September 28, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 118, Saving, of the 22nd September, I have the honour to submit to your Lordship the following further information concerning the Cabinet changes which were announced on the 21 st September. 2 . The Prime Minister, whom I saw on the day the changes took place, was reticent and had little to say about his new colleagues except that one was a member of the Shaukat family, one was a Shia (Sadiq Bassam) and one a Kurd (Jalal Baban), and that the latter was an honest man. This last encomium surprised me, as from many others I had heard that in May 1938 Jalal Baban had been forced to resign from Jamil Madfai’s Cabinet because of his more than dubious dealings with a Government contractor. 3. I asked about the fate of earlier plans for broadening the basis of the Government by including several ex-Prime Ministers. Nuri Pasha said that this had not been his idea but Jamil Madfai's. His own view was that such a Cabinet could not work harmoniously or be stable. Moreover, Jamil Madfai had made conditions which it had seemed to the Prime Minister to be unwise, or at least premature, to accept. On the other hand, he had arranged that either the Regent or he himself should consult Jamil Madfai on matters of importance, and he hoped, therefore, to obtain Jamil Madfai's general support. 4. Taufiq Suwaidi, who dined with me alone on the 27th September, told me a different story. He said that during the summer Nuri Pasha had sent an intermediary to the Lebanon to visit his brother Naji Suwaidi, Jamil Madfai and himself and to suggest that they and Rashid Ali Gailani and Naji Shaukat should all join the Cabinet. The Suwaidis and Jamil Madfai had accepted this proposal, and Taufiq Suwaidi had undertaken to bring the others into line. Their one condition was that the Prime Minister and his whole Cabinet should first resign, and that they should enter an entirely new Cabinet and not merely join Nuri Pasha’s existing Administration. Their reason for this condition was that they did not wish it to appear that they approved of the policy which had been followed by the present Cabinet, many of whose actions were, in their opinion, wrong. When they returned to Bagdad early in September the matter had been reopened with the Prime Minister, but he had told them that he was unable to proceed with the plan as the Regent did not approve of it. He was satisfied, however, that this was only an excuse. I would here interpolate that from other sources I have heard that the plan would have involved the entry of Rashid Ali as one of the ex-Prime Ministers into the new Cabinet, in order that one of the Suwaidis brothers could take his place at the Palace, since there would not be room for both brothers in the Cabinet. As the post at the Palace gives special opportunities for exercising influence not only with the Regent but with his numerous important visitors, it is thought unlikely that Rashid Ali would care to vacate it except to become Prime Minister. He may there fore have inspired the Regent to discourage General Nuri from tendering his resignation, or himself have warned Nuri against the dangers of being double- crossed if he once resigned. Without any warning, however, these dangers may in any case have occurred to General Nuri and his friends. 5 . Taufiq Suwaidi went on to say that the additions which had, in fact, been made to the Cabinet by the Prime Minister were all men of the third rank and would bring no strength to the Prime Minister, an opinion with which I am disposed to agree. He added that Nuri Pasha was becoming increasingly unpopular, because of his persecution of all those who had anything to do with Hikmat Sulaiman and Bekr Sidqi, and because he was filling important [730 f—1]posts everywhere with incompetent personal adherents. It seemed to him that in these circumstances a change of Government would probably occur before long. 6 . I observed that for Iraq's own sake and for the sake of her reputation abroad, I sincerely hoped that if a change occurred it would be effected constitu tionally, for in these critical days any violent upheaval would be disastrous. What was wanted was a strong Government with a united country behind it, determined, in alliance with Great Britain, to see the war through to a success ful conclusion. Taufiq Suwaidi said that he entirely agreed with me, and he and the others were all avoiding any activity likely to embarrass the Govern ment. On the other hand, it was difficult for them to give real support to Nuri Pasha so long as he persisted in his pursuit of personal vengeance. Here he mentioned Hikmat Sulaiman, and said that he was convinced that the charges brought against him were fabricated, and the evidence on which he had been convicted was false. I asked Taufiq Suwaidi what he thought of Taha-al- Hashimi, the Minister of Defence, and his position in the Cabinet. He said that Taha was an honest, well-intentioned man, but better suited to be Chief of the General Staff than a Minister. The idea that Taha was ambitious and aimed at becoming Prime Minister was dismissed summarily by Taufiq Suwaidi, who said that Taha-al-Hashimi knew well enough that he was not fit to hold such a position. 7. This conversation left me with the impression that the Suwaidis, Jamil Madfai and Naji Shaukat, though possibly they were doing nothing to under mine Nuri Pasha’s position, would do nothing to support him, and, in fact, would be glad to see him forced to resign. Rashid’s Ali's position is uncertain, but he is most probably playing for his own hand and he may not have forgiven Jamil Madfai and his colleagues for having banished him from Bagdad last December, although his quarrel with them is said to have been composed. 8 .

UNDER articles 81, 82 and 83 of the Iraqi Constitution, it is provided inter alia that, if any question arises necessitating an interpretation of a Constitution, it shall be examined by a High Court specially convoked for the purpose. 2. Such a court has recently been sitting under the chairmanship pi the President of the Senate, in order to decide whether, for the purpose of article 64 of the Constitution, which lays down that the number of Ministers of State shall not exceed nine or be less than six, the Prime Minister shall rank as one of the Council of Ministers. This development, which at first sight appears somewhat Gilbertian, has, in fact, a practical aspect, which arises from the present composition of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister now holds the additional portfolio of Minister of the Interior, and the other Ministers are those of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice, Communications and education. the ministerial portfolios at present held are, therefore, seven in numbei, oi eight if the Prime Minister were to be regarded as holding one apart from his portfolio of Minister of the Interior. If he were so regarded, there would be only one vacancy under article 64 of the Constitution, namely, the portfolio of the newU- created Ministry of Economics. The question which I have described as having been at issue, as also the question whether Ministers without portfolio may be created, is clearly of some importance in the event of the Prime Minister desiring to enlarge, or broaden the basis of, the Government. 3 . The high court’s investigations seem, in fact, to have been undertaken with a view to carrying a stage further negotiations which have been in progress for some time for the purpose of appointing Ministers of the Interioi and Economics, and of creating, if the Constitution permits, a Ministry of Health. A further consideration is that, while there are at present two Shia members of the Cabinet (the Minister of Finance, Rustam Haidar—Personalities, No. 73—and the Minister of Education, Salih Jabr—Personalities, No. 79), there is only one Kurd (the Minister of Communications, Umar Nazmi—Personalities No. 87), and the question of bringing in a second Kurd to balance a possible third Shia may well have been under examination. 4. The court has now decided that the Prime Minister does not rank as one of the nine Ministers laid down in article 64 of the Constitution; that a ninth portfolio can therefore be created under the Constitution; but that Ministers without portfolio” are not permitted. The Prime Minister, in confirming to me on the 11th September that he now had altogether three portfolios at his disposal, said that he had been discussing with the Cabinet whether they should be filled from the ranks of those who were more or less opposed to the Government or from the Government’s supporters. In the former event, offers might be made to Jamil Madfai (Personalities, No. 41), Taufiq or Naji Suwaidi (Personalities Nos. 85 and 64). and Naji Shaukat (Personalities, No. 63). The latter (who it will be remembered resigned from the Ministership of the Intel 101 eail)/ this summei) had however General Nuri said, been trying to cause discontent by alleging that the ’army had been kept short of arms. If, General Nuri observed, new members of the Cabinet chosen from among the Opposition would not co-operate loyally with the rest, the Government would be weakened instead of stlengthened, and in that case it would be better to select the new recruits from among their present supporters. The Prime Minister seemed at that moment to be inclined towards this latter course, but said that the question would be discussed further in the Cabinet. ^ ^ sen( H n g copies of this despatch to the Government of India and to the Combined Middle East Intelligence Centre.

Rumour has been actively circulated that a reconstruction of the government was likely for the purpose of eliminating Minister of Defence, General Tahao It was suggested that he would be replaced by Sahib Najib, who is an excellent man but not popular with the \rmy, that Ali Jaudat would become Prime Minister and General Nuri Foreign Minister. Such changes could only weaken the Government, as General Taha would be more dangerous outside the Government than in it. Moreover, while he is Pan-Arab and strongly nationalist, he is probably neither pro-German nor anti-British. Although rumour seemed to me either irresponsible or mischievous I thought prudent to mention it to Minister for Foreign Affairs, who assured me that it was without foundation. He suspected German sources. This I am the more inclined to credit, because the departing German Minister himself brought it to the notice of my American colleague, as I told Ali Jaudat. While expressing m}'' relief that there would be no such weakening of the Government at this juncture, I took the opportunity to enquire whether a broadening of its basis was likely/Si f likely to be considered. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that additions were under consideration and might include Jamil Madfai and possibly also Taufiq Suwaidi. A quarrel between the former and Rashid Ali (who would be dangerous in opposition) has been composed, and if proposed additions (particularly that of Madfai) eventuate they should be a source of strength.

I HA'S/ E the honour to inform your Lordship that the Iraqi Parliament was adjourned on the 7th August. The session will be continued early in October. In the meantime most of the Ministers intend to take a holiday, and the Prime Minister is planning a tour in the north with the Regent. The session began on the 12th June after a general election, and a great deal of business has been dealt with m two months’ work. 2 . Over forty laws have been passed through all the necessary stages, in cluding the budget for 1939-40 and the Liwa Administration Law, a measure of nrst-class importance which aims at widespread decentralisation in the adminis tration of the provinces. The law amending the Constitution, the present Government s principal scheme, will not be ready until Parliament meets again m October. The other chief laws enacted are set out in the enclosed schedule^). 3. The Ministers seem confident of a quiet recess, and although one hears the usual stories of unrest here and there no indications of any impending political change are apparent. A revival of political activity may be expected when the out-of-office leaders return from summering in the Lebanon. Some distrust is telt at the role of Rashid Ali, the chief official at the court, who is an ambitious intriguer. 4-. Apart from the usual whirlpools set up by personal enmities and ambitions, thn mam current in the political stream still flows from agitation about Palestine. The Prime Minister stands squarely for help and support for the Arabs of Palestine within the bounds imposed by his adherence to a policy of close friendship with His Majesty’s Government.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5620/474/931 n -, 1957 August 10. 1939. Section 1. Copy No. Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received August 10.) (No. 418.) NIy Lord, Bagdad, July 29, 1939. WITH reference to my despatch No. 417 of the 29th July on the subject of opportunity ^ ^ frankly and at some length on a matter which may be of considerable ultimate importance, that is, the persistent poisoning of the mind of the youth of this country with hostile ideas about Great Britain. 2. 1 told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it had caused me surprise and anxiety for the future of his country to discover that in the press and in the schools the history of the British association with Iraq was deliberately distorted. Young people were taught that Iraq had gained her freedom in a triumphant struggle against British oppression, and that only British imperialism now stood in the way of the rapid progress and development of the new Iraqi State. Nothing was said of the fact that it was Great Britain that had created Iraq out of three obscure provinces of the Ottoman Empire, given her national cohesion and set her up in the short space of ten years as an independent State member of the League of Nations. Nor was it ever made clear to the youth of the country that, but for the alliance with Great Britain, the liberty and independence newly gained by Iraq with our help might prove short-lived. The very existence of Iraq depended on Anglo-Iraqi friendship and co-operation, and yet the youth of the country (who would be its rulers in a few years) were being taught to believe that the essence of patriotism was enmity towards the one country which assured their independence. These young men, I said, would grow up and come into power with an utterly false understanding of their country’s international position, and there was a grave danger that they would make political blunders that would jeopardise the whole future of the country. National education was an essential factor of national unity, but it was vital that a sound and not a false national doctrine should be taught in the schools, and that the fundamental importance of friendship and co-operation with Great Britain should be impressed upon the minds of Iraqi children and students. 3. The minister was rather taken aback by the emphasis and gravity of my remarks, but did not attempt to dispute the accuracy of what I had said concerning the nature of the ideas generally given to Iraqi children about Great Britain, or to deny the complete dependence of Iraq on the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. He endeavoured, however, to argue that I was overstating the extent to which there was public ignorance of the facts of Iraq’s international position, and claimed that all thinking people appreciated how much their country owed to Great Britain. I replied that I did not doubt that the facts were understood by his Excellency and his colleagues and men like them, with whom we were happy to maintain such excellent relations, but we must all have regard to our responsibilities for the future, and my point was that the realities of Iraq's history and of her future were being deliberately concealed from the youth, who being filled during their most susceptible years with dangerously false doctrines. 4 . I went on to speak of the need for care in sending students abroad for higher education. Students sent to the United Kingdom were never subjected to political influence by the British Government, but this was not the position in many countries. For example, in Germany it was part of the policy of the Government to subject all foreign students, and especially those from Arab countries, to intensive Nazi propaganda. For some time the Iraqi Governmentf k 2 persuaded to join political societies organised by the Nazis, and were encouraged to take part in political activities which, though nominally inspired by the ideals of Arab nationalism, were in fact aimed entirely at furthering German interests, and were in no way concerned with the cultural or moral development of the students themselves. Moreover, the leaders, who were employed to direct these activities among the Arab students, were, it seemed, often men of low character, whose influence could only be bad. I instanced the notorious Yunis Bahry (the Arabic announcer at the Berlin Radio Station), and said that I had drawn the attention of the Prime Minister to his activities among Arab students in Berlin. The Prime Minister had told me that, to the best of his knowledge, no new students were being sent to Berlin this year, and I sincerely hoped that his Excellency’s information on this point was accurate. 5. The upshot of our talk was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs undertook to discuss my observations with the Minister of Education, but, although Ali Jaudat seemed impressed, I doubt whether much result will accrue. If your Lordship approves, I propose therefore to take such further opportunities as may occur from time to time to speak on similar lines. I hope, furthermore, that the propaganda which is now being developed by His Majesty’s Government may find means of remedying in some measure the deficiencies of those responsible in Iraq for the education in foreign affairs of the youth of the country. 6 .

My Lord, I have the honour to report that during the course of* a visit ^hich he naid to the Embassy on July 26th the Minister for Foreign Affairs sooke to me about a certain Akram Zuaiter. He said that this man, who was of Palestinian origin and was no r employed as a teacher in Iraq, had orepared a text book for use in the Irac[i schools and ’ ished to go to Pyria to arrange for its publication. The French authorities would not, however, give him a visa because of his active association with Arab nationalism. The Minister said that Akram Zu'iiter had given assurances that while in Syria he would abstain from all nolitical work and asked me ■’•hether I would say a word in the right quarter with a view to persuading the French authorities to grant the necessary visa to enable him to remain there for about a month. 2. I told His Excellency that he knew as well as I did that Akram Zuaiter had carried on a relentless campaign of hostile propaganda against His Majesty’s Government and only quite recently had distinguished himself by the violence of the attack hich he had made on the British Government in the speech which he delivered at the public gathering held to mark the end of official mourning for the late King Ghazi. I felt, in consequence, in no way disposed to intervene on his behalf. The Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted the force of my remarks and did not press his point.

This proclamation in its present form does not, I understand, mean that the civil administration in these qadhas is suspended but only that offences committed within their boundaries can now, presumably at the discretion of the Officer Commanding, be tried by the Military Court set up in Mosul last April at the time of the murder of Mr. Monck-Mason. 2.

FOREIGN OFFICE, G.W.l 4th May, 1939 IMMEDIATE, Sir / I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith conies of a despatch of April 13th and a telegram of April 20th from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad on the subject of credits for the Iraqi Government. 2. It will be seen that in these two paners Mr. Houstoun-Boswall sets forth the credit facilities for which the Iraqi Government have asked, which amount to 03,250,000 for military credits (including however some 0650,000 in respect of arms factories, v/hich might possibly be counted as civil expenditure), and 02,000,000 for civil credits (including some £500,000 in respect of orders for railway material which have already been placed in this country, but excluding the amount that would be required for the execution of the Habbaniyah scheme and for the provision of a number of buses for the Bagdad Municipality). He also states that the Iraqi Government have proposed that this sura of £5,250,000 should be repaid from oil royalties at the rate of £500,000 per annum , and that he regards it as most desirable that everything possible should be done to meet their requirements. He further asks that consideration should/ The Secretary Export Credits Guarantee Department. \r should be given to two suggestions which have occurred to him? (1) that an immediate loan night be made of, say, £1,000,000 to meet the most pressing cash requirements of the Iraqi Government, and (ii) that the second-hand guns and ammunition which are to be supplied from 'Var Office stocks, might be transferred immediately to the Iraqi Government gratis . 3. 'Vith regard to these two suggestions. His Majesty's Government have no powers at present either to make a direct loan to a foreign Government, or to present war material, even to an ally, without payment. Although, therefore, Lord Halifax finds himself in entire agreement with the principles urged by Mr. Houstoun-Boswall in his despatch and telegram, His Lordship considers that the meet practical method of giving financial assistance to the Iraqi Government is on the lines hitherto followed, i.e. through the grant of credits for the export both of non-military and military material from the United Kingdom, where necessary under the special facilities orovided in Article 4 of the recent Export Guarantees Act. 4. His Majesty's Government are at present making serious efforts, partly at any rate because of the international situation, to satisfy the Arab States as to the policy to be adooted in Palestine. it would be paradoxical if His Majesty's Government were to fail to gain the full benefit of these efforts by not doing everything in their power to meet these States in other directions. m particular, the considerations brought forward by Mr. Houstoun-Boswall appear to Lord Halifax to make it essential for/for His Majesty’s Government to make a serious and an early effort to meet the financial needs of Iraq at this juncture. Quite apart from any other reason, the importance of ensuring that Iraq shall he not merely an ally, but a friendly and willing ally, cannot be over-estimated. The armed help of Iraq in time of war is no doubt of small importance, but her geographical position is vital* 5* Moreover it appears to Lord Halifax that, to the Iraqi Government, the proposition which they have put forward must seem a fair one. The period of redemption, though perhaps longer than might be wished, is, as they must know, considerably shorter than that granted in the case of the Turkish credit, some of which is not to be repaid until 1962, while the amount of the oil royalties to be ear-marked for repayment is covered more than three times by the minimum annual payments from the Iraq Petroleum Company. The security which Iraq can offer is, in fact, strong by comparison with that of most of the countries whom His Majesty's Government are constrained to help on political grounds. Failure to meet the Iraqi Government's requirements in full is likely in these circumstances to be regarded as a sign of indifference, if not of ill-will, on the part of His Majesty's Government. 6* If His Majesty's Government were to refuse the Iraqi Government the full credits for which they ask, the latter would indeed still be under a treaty obligation not to accept the offer of C4,000,000 credits for military purchases which they are known to have received from the German/r m3 German Government. In practice, however, it might be extremely difficult to induce them to reject this offer, and if His Majesty’s Government were to declare themselves unable to help the Iraqi Government to carry out their military programme - a programme vhich, as they have themselves oointed out, has been drawn up with the advice of the British Military Mission in Iraq - and were then to stand on the letter of the Treaty provisions, the effect might destroy entirely the future value of the Anglo-Iraqi alliance. 7. Po far as military credits are concerned, Lord Halifax is aware that, while 'U,000,000 has already been ear-marked for the Iraqi Government out of the total of £10,000,000 at nresent available under Clause IV of the Export Guarantees Act, it will not be possible materially to increase this amount under the powers at present possessed by His Majesty’s Government. A reply to the Iraqi Government based on this fact is not one which will seem to them at all convincing. Consideration is however already being given to the possibility of taking powers to increase the amount available under Clause IV of the Act, and, if this can be done, His Lordship considers it essential to provide a sum sufficient to cover inter alia the whole military requirements of the Iraqi Government as now stated. 8. In view, moreover, of the great interest taken by the Service Departments in the Habbaniyah scheme in connexion with the overland route from Basra to the Mediterranean, His Lordship would also urge that the figure/figure of £2,000,000, v/hich he 'believes to have 'been taken hitherto as the maximum for the civil credits to be granted to Iraq, should be sufficiently increased to allo^ for the execution of this scheme, ^hich has the additional advantage of being ultimately a source of further revenue to the Iraqi Government. it is also for consideration whether a credit should not be provided for the relatively small amount required in connexion with the provision of busbs for the Bagdad Municipality, the contract for which win be placed in this country if credit facilities can be arranged. If these additional facilities were provided, it would, no doubt, be possible to arrange with the Ireqi Government for an increase in the amount of the annual payments to be made by them in liquidation of the credits. 9. It will be seen that the time factor is an important one. Sir Basil Newton is due to arrive at Bagdad on about May 20th and even if it has not proved possible by that date to reach decisions which will make any further statement on the subject of the credits possible, Lord Halifax considers it most desirable that he should be able on his arrival at least to tell the Iraqi Government: (1) That His Majesty’s Government will give the Iraqi Government a credit for £1,000,000 for their immediate military needs, v/ithout prejudice to the possibility of a substantial increase in military credits as soon as the question has been fully explored. (2) That His Majesty's Government will by one method or another give the Iraqi Government a credit sufficient to cover their immediate commitments in the matter of railway material, without prejudice to the possibility'9 MS of a substantial increase in non-military credits as soon as the question has been fully explored. 10. Lord Halifax would be glad if he might receive a reply to this letter at a very early date. Copies of this letter are being sent to all Departments represented on the Special Credits Allocation Committee and on the Middle East Sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, rCrf ' C. BAXTFffCOPY (E 2821/374/93) No - T86, No 158/E« V 26/39) . British Embassy, Bagdad 0 13th April, l939o My Lord, Y/ith reference to your telegram No* 53_of March 13th on the subject of credits for the Iraqi Government, I have the honour to enclose a copy of the aide memoire (Enclosure NOol; in which the observations in that telegram were conveyed to the Iraqi Government* I also enclose a copy of a memorandum (Enclosure No*. 2) containing their views thereon, which was handed to me on April 10th by the Prime Minister in the presence of the Minister of Finance* 2. Rustam Haidar Beg made a frank statement regarding the Iraqi Government’s financial difficulties and requirements,, Their embarrassment was, he said, solely attributable to injudicious railway expenditure as was fully explained in the memorandum. By way of illustration of the position he mentioned that at the end of the financial year on March 3lst last the Government were faced v/ith an overdraft of I.D.360,000, which had been covered by an issue of six-month Treasury Bills for I.D.200,000 and by a draft on the Iraq Petroleum Company to the extent of I.D.250,000 in respect of oil royalties for the first quarter of 1939. The overdraft was more than accounted for by railway expenditure on capital works, which had reached I.D.1,060,000 whereas provision had been The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc*, etc*, etc*,been made for only I.D.650,000o He added, by way of emphasising that the financial position was inherently sound and that the present stringency had arisen owing to peculiar circumstances which were most unlikely to recur, that the 1938/9 ordinary budget would again show a surplus almost equal to the average obtained in previous years. 3. The Minister of Finance also laid stress on his determination to cut his coat according to his cloth. He was prepared to curtail public works to the bare minimum imposed by the shortage of funds; he was, nevertheless, confronted with the urgent necessity of (a) purchasing essential defence requirements and (b) meeting commitments undertaken by the railways. As regards (a), in view of the colossal expenditure on armaments undertaken by His Majesty 1 s Government he and his colleagues were at a loss to understand why it should not be possible for facilities to be accorded for most, if not all, of Iraq’s comparatively modest needs, which he pointed out had been determined by the British Military Mission. 4. The Iraqi Government find the attitude of His Majesty’s Government all the more difficult to appreciate in view of the fact that the Germans, despite their financial difficultie and accelerated armament programme, have offered to supply on extended terms even more munitions than are considered to be essential for the defence of this country, (See my telegram I No. 80). Inevitably doubts arise in the Iraqi mind as to whether it pays to be an ally of Great Britain, for it is the material advantage to be obtained from an alliance that counts with the Iraqis in the final analysis. They still are incapable of understanding how it is that, even on grounds of highhigh strategical considerations, facilities are granted, for instance, to Turkey (the case most often referred to here) which are made so difficult for Iraq.* I consider it highly desirable, therefore, that the Iraqi request for assistance in the purchase of armaments should be dealt with as i sympathetically and as expeditiously as possible, and I hope that the Export Credits Guarantee Department will see their way to increase substantially in that respect the total amount of the credits which have been so far envisaged* 5. The total requirements of the Ministry of Defence are placed at £3,250,000, of which £646,000 is for machinery and materials not regarded as munitions of war* Included in the latter figure is the cost of plant for shell factories and extensions to the small arms factory. The priority of the respective requirements is indicated in the enclosed statement (Enclosure No* 3) dealing specifically with them. 6. The Iraqi Government have repeatedly impressed upon me their urgent need for the early delivery of the 18-pounder guns and 4.5 howitzers, together with the ammunition required for this artillery* The cost of these particular stores amounts in round figures to £700,000 and the Iraqi Government are unable to find the money to pay for them on the customary terms. They urge that as the guns and howitzers are to be supplied from stocks of obsolescent weapons withdrawn from army use and that as they are willing to accept shells from War Office stocks, it would be possible to solve this part of their financial problem if His Majesty’s Government could arrange to supply these stores on special terms - by accepting, for example, the usual lC$ with the indent and spreadingAspreading the payment of the balance over a period of several years. I should be glad to be informed as soon as possible whether His Majesty’s Government are willing to make a proposal on these lines. 7. In amplification of the statement made on page 9 of the Iraqi Government’s memorandum regarding security in respect of the proposed credits, the Minister of Finance explained that he was prepared to consider giving any reasonable guarantee that the Export Credits Guarantee Department might require and that he left it to them to suggest the form in which the credits should be recognised, whether by Treasury bills or other documents. It will be seen that the Minister proposes to allocate £500,000 a year from oil royalties for the liquidation of the credits. As regards safeguards against uncontrolled expenditure upon public works, he said that he could not answer for future Governments, but that any steps that were possible would be taken to prevent over spending again. I am of the opinion that the best safeguard His Majesty’s Government could have would be the appointment of an Adviser to the Ministry of Finance who would effectively watch over the interests both of His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government. In this connexion I was disappointed to learn from Mr. Baggallay’s letter of April 4th (E2458/l889 / 93) that the Treasury are unable to second one of their officials for this post. In view of the proposed credits, apart from other considerations, I trust that it will be possible for the Treasury to reconsider the matter. 8. The Minister of Finance referred to the Bagdad Passenger Transport Service. He stated that this servicehad no funds with which to purchase the 100 buses they required and were hoping that the Government would help them to finance the transaction. The Government, however, could not do so without assistance from the Export Credits Guarantee Department. As this seemed to be a case which could conveniently be treated on its merits, it was suggested to the Minister that he should propose a basis of payment. He undertook to find an early opportunity of discussing the matter with his colleagues with a view to formulating a concrete proposal. Vvhile buses were under discussion, the Prime Minister remarked ’’Always buses - yes, you can finance buses - but you aren’t the same about arms”. I made the usual reply about commercial credits, etc., but he was not impressed, and reminded me of the international situation. 9. Mr. Hogg intends to leave Bagdad for London on April x6t&amp; by air. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been requested by the Minister of Finance to inform the Iraqi Minister in London that Mr. Hogg will discuss the credits question with the Export Credits Guarantee Department and the other departments concerned. 10.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have been actively considering the request which was recently addressed to them by the Iraqi Government for the extension of credit facilities for the purchase of materials connected with their public works programme and of munitions of war. In this connexion the details of the Iraqi Government’s needs which have been supplied to Sir Maurice Peterson orally from time to time by members of the Iraqi Government have been most useful to His Majesty’s Government in their endeavour to arrive at an estimate of the Iraqi Government’s requirements. The Iraqi Government will, however, appreciate that in a matter of this sort it is of the first importance that His Majesty’s Government shall be placed in possession of a complete, authoritative and official statement of the Iraqi Government’s financial policy and requirements in relation/ to the desired credits. 2. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government would be glad if the Iraqi Government would furnish them as soon as possible with a statement containing the following information;- (l) A general description of the Iraqi budgetary position, ? the position regarding Iraq s balance of payments and otherother matters bearing upon the capacity of the Iraqi Government to discharge their financial obligations; (2) a list showing precisely the nature of the schemes for which credits are required and a statement of how far such projects are related to any larger programme of public works: (3) a list of projects or materials which may properly be described as being for purposes of defence and in regard to which credits are desired, together with an indication of the items on such a list which must definitely be considered to be munitions of war# In this connexion the Embassy is to explain that the Export Credits Guarantee Department is, in the course of its ordinary business, precluded from giving guarantees for the export of munitions. Under the Export Guarantees Act, which has now become law, additional guarantees are, indeed, authorised and these may be for munitions, but such guarantees are limited in the aggregate. A portion of the sum available will be allocated to Iraq (subject of course to agreement being reached as to terms and to the availability of the material v/hich the Iraqi Government desire to purchase) if the Iraqi Government submit detailed applications* At the same time the Embassy feels bound to make it clear to the Iraqi Government at the outset that, owing to the fact that a number of different governments are anxious to purchase arms in the United Kingdom on credit, it will not be feasible for Iraq f s quota under this head to attain anything likethe figure of £3,000,000; (4) a list of the purchases which are to be made in the United Kingdom under any credits that may be arranged. The guarantees of the Export Credits Guarantee Department are intended to cover the export of goods from the United Kingdom, but only a strictly limited amount of the related expenditure in the country of the buyer, such as local installation costs; (5) a statement as to whether the Basra grain silo, the Automatic Telephone Exchange for Bagdad and the omnibuses for the Bagdad Passenger Transport Service (in regard to which the Export Credits Guarantee Department have already been approached by United Kingdom firms) are included among the projects for which credits are now required, or whether they form part of some other plan of capital expenditure; (6) the circumstances in which the Iraqi Government’s present financial difficulties have arisen and, in particular, the reasons for the heavy over-expenditure by the Railway Administration, which is understood to be a principal factor in the situation. (7) in view of the fact that, as it is understood, it is proposed that security for the credits shall be constituted by the royalties which the Iraqi Government receive from the production of oil in Iraq, a statement as to what charges already exist upon those royalties and how such charges rank. In this connexion the Iraqi Government will realize that it is essential that His Majesty’s Government should be satisfied that security in respect of the credits shallshall not be endangered by uncontrolled expenditure upon public works or by the issue of short-dated bills on the Iraq Petroleum Company 0 3. It is realised that the most satisfactory way of handling the matter would be for the Minister of Finance or some other well-qualified Iraqi representative to proceed to London and discuss the questions with the competent departments of His Majesty’s Government. The object of such a visit would in the first place be the providing of His Majesty’s Government with the necessary information on the points described above: and should the Iraqi Government desire to follow this course, the Embassy is sure that such a visit would be welcomed.COPY ENCLOSURE NO 8 2 IN BAGDAD DESPATCH NO. L58/E OP 13/4/39. Memorandum in reply to the Aide Memoire recently handed to the Iraqi Minister of Finance. 1 • A gene ral description of the Iraqi Budgetary position, the position regar ding Iraq's balance of payments, and other matters hearing upo n the capacity of the Iraqi Government to discharge their financial obligations . Reference para 2 (l) of the Aide-Memoire. (a) The Budgetary position down to 31.3.38. If the capitalised payment made in 1929/30, in discharge of the major part of Iraq’s obligations in respect of the Ottoman Public Debt, is omitted, the series of ordinary Budgets from 1921—22 to 1937-38 have left surpluses amounting to 3.567.000 ID., that is to say an average of more than 200.000 ID. per annum over these seventeen years. Over the same period, the Iraqi Government has received by way of Capital Receipts, principally constituted by Oil Royalties, a sum of 4,872,000 ID. making, with the surpluses on the Ordinary Budget, a total of 8,439,000 ID. Out of these funds, the Iraqi Government has discharged the Capitalised Debt Payment referred to above amounting to 1,437,000 ID. and has expended 7,699,000 ID. on Capital Works, leaving a deficit on 31*3.38 of 696,000 ID; but in the expenditure of 7,699,000 ID. is included a sum of 493,875 ID. for the acquisition of the Iraq Railways and the writing off of earlier loans made to the Railway Administration and a sum of 292,727 ID. being recoverable advances made to Municipalities, assets which more than cover the deficit. NOTE. The proceeds of the Loan issued in 1937 were handed over to the Railway Administration and no expenditure in respect/respect of the Baiji-Tel Kotchek Extension was shewn in the Government Accounts for that year, (h) The financial years 1938-39 and 39-40, The Ordinary Budget of 1938-39 was estimated to produce a surplus of 195,677 IDo On 31st January 1939 the realised surplus was 364,000 ID; and although expenditure in February and March normally exceeds the revenue received in these months, the surplus on 31st March should be realised 0 Capital receipts up to 31.1.39 totalled 2.037.000 ID. and no more are estimated to be received during the remainder of the financial year. Capital expenditure at that date totalled 1,724,000 ID, including 700,000 ID« advances to the Railway Administration for the Baiji-Tel Kotchek line. It is anticipated that further Capital expenditure to 31st March will not exceed 600 ,000 ID; and if so the total accumulated deficit on 31st March 1939 will have increased from about 696,000 to 800,000 ID. The draft Budget of 1939-40 has not yet been passed by Parliament. The estimates as they stand at present provide for an expenditure of 5,771,900, being an increase of 302,100 ID. over the estimates for the current year. Of this, approximately 100.000 ID. is for Defence, 100,000 ID. for Education, 15,000 for and the balance for Land Settlement, Public Works and Irrigation. The Revenue ■ n the existing basis is estimated to produce 5,712,000, and proposals will oe made to Parliament for making some adjustments in taxations which will more than cover the difference. In fact the estimates of the Iraqi Government are prepared with caution as is shewn by a comparison of the original estimates/ raT estimates and actual results of the past three completed years: Revenue Expenditure Estimated Actual (l) Estimated Actual in thousands. Iraqi Dinars» 1935-36. 4496 4759 4494 4413 1936-37. 4729 5427 4 727 4756 1937-38. 5322 6186 5319 5169 (l) Excluding supplementary estimates« In conclusion, it will be seen that the position of the Ordinary Budget is one of great strength, and that apart from Railway Capital Expenditure, the Government's resources have been more than adequate to meet its Capital Expenditure. (c) Balance o f payments and other matters bearing upon the gg-paoity of the Iraqi_Governme nt to discharge their financial obligations . The Statements annually forwarded to the League of Nations are available for reference (see League of Nations Publications, Balance of Payments, 1937, p.123); but the Iraqi Government does not place excessive reliance upon them. The British Government will be aware of the difficulty of producing an accurate balance of this nature in a country like Iraq. But it is pertinent to observe that the situation of the currency is exceptionally strong, that there are no restrictions on foreign payments and no restrictions on trade other than the regulation limiting the value of imports into Iraq from Japan and certain other countries, whose trade with Iraq was markedly unbalanced, to a figure not exceeding four times the value of their exports from Iraq, 2 ' £ilg dit s required , Ref. para 2 (3) of the Aide-Memoire&lt;, The Ministry of Defence has formulated its requirements and a memorandum on the subject is being forwarded under separate cover; the items which must definitely be considered to be munitions of war are therein made clear. The// The Iraqi Government notes with disappointment the concluding words of the sub-paragraph under reference, which appear to intimate that the total facilities which could b© afforded in this respect would amount to very much less than £3,000 ,000. The requirements of the Ministry of Defence amount to about £3,250,000; of which £646,000 is for Machinery and Material not to be classified as munitions of war; they have been formulated as the result of careful study in consultation with the Military Mission, and in the considered opinion of the Iraqi Government they are essential to the safety of the countryo of priority of these demands and one total period over which supply could be spread; buu it is the earnest hope of the Iraqi Government that an arrangement will be found to be possible, since it would be extremely reluctant at all times, and more especially so in the present state of international relations, to place orders elsewhere than in the United Kingdom. 3. Railway Credits . Reference para 2 (6) of the Aide-Memoire. Mention has already been made of the fact that a sum of 493,575 ID. is included in the Capital Expenditure referred to in para 1 (a) above; this sum represented the contribution of 150,000 ID, made by the Iraqi Treasury to the purchase price of the Railways, and the writing off of past loans amounting to 343,875 ID.; tne balance of the purchase price, 250,000 ID., was met from Railway Funds* Work on the extension began in November 1936 a The Capital Works Programme of the Railv/ay Administration for 1937-38 provided for the Baiji-Tel Kotchek Extension 1,687,000 ID* to The Ministry of Defence is prepared to indicate the orde be spread over the years 1937-38 and 1938-39; the amount to be spent in 1937-38 was estimated at 1,028,000 ID. These figures were/were included in ihe S'bnt s Budge c for 19o7 -i58 under the heading of Capital Works. The credit for 1937-38 v/as not in fact utilised, since the proceeds of the Iraq State Loan were handed over to the Railway Administration, which undertook, vis-a-vis the Treasury, to meet the service of the Loan. Actual expenditure on the extension in 1937-38 was 942,330 ID. The Capital Works Programme for the years 1938-42 provided among other allotments for 1*000,000 ID. for the line extension to meet the total further cost, after allowing for expenditure in 1937-38 of 1,250 ,000 ID. the balance would, it was hoped, 'be met from R&amp;ilwsv Puv.ds Finally on 4th February 1939. the Ministry of Finance - received an estimate placing the total cost of the line (exclusive of preliminary expenses of the Loan) at a figure of 3,262,600 ID. The reasons for the growth in the total estimated cost, as submitted on different occasions to the Ministry of Finance , are the haste with which the project was undertaken and the speed with which the Railway Administration was instructed to carry it out, and the fact that when the project was undertaken there was no survey of the route; the survey was not in fact completed till shortly before the submission of the final estimate referred to above, which was in fact the first estimate of the cost of construction based upon knowledge. The Iraqi Government is conscious that the procedure adopted is open to criticism and was not in harmony with the financial traditions of the country. The present position is that the Treasury assigned to the Railways the first tranche of the Iraq State Loan, one Million Dinars, advanced to it a further million in its Capital Works Programme, covering the years 1938-39 - 1942-43 inclusive, and anticipated that any further expenditure required could bemet from surplus railway receipts; this expectation has been uisappointed by the serious fall in prices which has greatly restricted exports, and consequently Railway Traffic, in the current year. Up to 31st March 1939 the Government had paid over to the Railways the whole of the sums which it had legal warrant to pay, and has further advanced to that Administration during the current month 60,000 ID. on Current Account* The Railways have expended the proceeds of the Loan and the Million provided by Government and the sums advanced in Current Account; they have orders outstanding with the Crown Agents amounting to 652,000 ID. apart from engagements in Iraq for local contracts and labour. The Railways have in fact undertaken obligations not covered by existing legislation and in excess of what their own resources allowed. This is the explanation of the present embarrassment. The Railways are still in need of a sum of 1,469,670 ID. to complete the Extension on the existing programme; the Government is however anxious to cut down this outstanding commitment and hopes to show a real financial saving on the figure as estimated. Of the amounts expended up to date (estimated to amount to 1,795,000 ID. on the 31st March, about 1,000,000 ID. represents orders placed in the United Kingdom, to which must be added the 652,000 ID. for which orders have been placed through the Crown Agents. The Cabinet is confident that it may rely on the assistance of the British Government in reaching an arrangemont by which Railway engagements can be met without undue hardship.■HI4. Further Schemes for which credits are desired. Reference paras 2 (2) (4) and (5) of Aide-Memoire. (a) The credits which the Iraqi Government desires to arrange are, in the first instance, those covering (a) The Defence requirements mentioned in para 2 above totalling 3-t millions. It is earnest desire of the Iraqi Government that these credits should be made available in order of priority; (b) the extension of Railway to Tel-Kotchek. The Government is prepared to make economies in the estimate referred to in para 3 and to extend the period of completion. The sum required will be communicated as soon as possible and will be spread over 1939-40 and 1940-41. (c) In regard to further schemes, these depend upon the amount of funds which can be made available after providing for the credits mentioned in (a) and (b). The existing commitments for works in hand, other than Defence and Railway requirements, will require about 800,000 ID. in 1939-40 and 150,000 ID. in 1941-42. The figure of 800,000 includes 272,000 for Irrigation, 120,000 for Roads, 272,000 ID for Bridges, 44,000 ID for the Automatic Exchange and Cable and 70,000 for Buildings. If this amount could be added to the sum required for completing the extension to Tel-Kotchek, the total requirements including Defence would then be in the neighbourhood of 5^: millions. The Iraqi Government hopes that terms of re payment could be arranged which would not involve a greater annual charge than 500,000 ID. commencing in 1940-41. If an arrangement could be reached covering this total the Iraqi Government would then be in a position to fix a /furtherfurther programme the size and composition of which can only he settled when the arrangements referred to above have been agreed upon. Among the schemes to he considered would he Irrigation:- The Hahhaniya Scheme: tenders have heen received, the cost of that now under consideration being 805,000 ID. Works on the Shamiya Canal to deal with the 'Naqqara' problem. Canalisation of the area served by the Shatt-el-Gharaf. Hoads: Construction of an all-weather system of Trunk roads. Industrial Buildings and Plant Construction of a Silo at Basra. u ' an..Oil Refinery and the provision of the necessary Tank Wagons. Marshalling Yards and New Warehouses in Bagdad. No reliable estimate of the cost of any of these schemes is yet available apart from the Habbaniya Scheme. As regards the Bagdad Bus Service, this will be a charge upon Municipal Funds, though the Iraqi Government would be prepared to guarantee any advances made to cover the cost of this scheme. No decision has yet been taken on the placing of a contract for this purpose. Its Capital Receipts being about 2,000,000 ID. a year (the service of the Baring Loan being born by the Railway Administration), a charge of 500,000 ID. annually in respect of the financial arrangement which it desires to conclude would leave a sum of 1,500,000 available. Of this the Government must reserve in its own hands, free of charge, a large proportion to meet the requirement of the country in connection with its capital works. The extent to which these projects can be put into execution depends upon the arrangements which can be made to finance them.( *2 A statement as to what charges already exist upon the Oil Royalties receivable by the Iraq Government and how such charges rank . The payments annually receivable by Iraq from Oil Companies are 1. A Royalty of 4/- per ton (gold) on oil won and saved by the Iraq Petroleum Company. The present export is slightly in excess of four million tons at present, and the Royalty therefore exceeds 800,000 pounds (gold). 2. A Dead Rent of 200,000 pounds (gold) payable by the British Oil Development Company until the beginning of regular export, and a similar Dead Rent payable by the Basra Oil Company until the beginning of regular export. Payments received from the Iraq Petroleum Company and the British Oil Development Company are subject to a prior charge of 10^ payable to the Turkish Government. After payment of this charge the amount received in the current year amounted to 1,977,000 ID. The only charge upon the royalties receivable by Iraq is that created by the General Bond securing the Iraq State Loan, the amount of which is £95,000 per annum and is recoverable from Railways. There is therefore available at least a net sum of 1,882,000 ID. or say 1,800,000. The sub-paragraph of the Aide-Memoire under consideration contains the words 'In this connexion the Iraqi Government will realise that it is essential that His Majesty’s Government should be satisfied that security in respect of the Credits should not be endangered by uncontrolled expenditure upon public works or by the issue of short dated bills on the Iraq Petroleum Company.' The/The intention of this passage is not wholly clear to the Iraqi Government. The Iraqi Government proposes to allocate from its oil revenue a yearly sum not exceeding £500,000 and to agree with the British Government as to the form in which the credits granted are to he recovered. The Iraqi Government welcomes the invitation of the British Government that the Minister of Finance should come to London for the purpose of concluding an arrangement. It will however he well understood that, in existing circumstances, it would he extremely difficult for the Minister to he absent from Iraq for a longer period than was required to sign an arrangement already agreed upon in all its main lines; and it is hoped that all but the concluding stage may be reached without the Minister's presence being necessary.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and, with reference to the explanatory note handed by H.E. the Acting Foreign Minister to Monsieur le Charg6 d’Affaires of His Britannic Majesty's Embassy, on the evening of the 10th April, 1939, dealing with the extension of credit facilities for the purchase of material and stores for the Public Works Programme and war munitions, have the honour to forward the enclosed statements showing the requirements r of the Ministry of Defence in respect of arms, ammunition, war materials and factory machinery and tools. These statements were prepared on the following bases:- (a) Indents for the second-hand guns and arms to be supplied by the British War Office. (b) Arms,ammunition and other war materials to be supplied by the British War Office and British firms. (c) Non-destructive war materials. (d) Factory machinery and tools and raw materials required for factories. Statement 'A” shows the requirements of second-hand and ammunition to be supplied by the British War Office from their own stocks, the cost of which amounts to I.D. 632,400, without commission, and I.D. 693,400 including commission at the rate of 12$. These requirements are shown in a separate statement, the Ministry of Defence foreseeing the possibility that they would not be covered by export credit facilities. It is hoped, however, that it 2 . guns /may\*T may Tdq possible to arrange for them to he delivered within a short period and paid for in instalments under special arrangements to he agreed upon between the British Government and the Iraqi Government 3 3. Statement M B' contains indents for new arms and ammunition and war materials to he supplied hy the British War Office and British firms, and covers destructive war materials the cost of which might he regarded as falling within the scope of the political credits which the Export Credits Department have heen authorised to grant» The value of these indents amount to IDo 1,470,000, without commission, and ID. 1,589,050 including commission. 4. Statement '0' contains a list of non-destructive war materials the cost of which amounts to IDo324,000, without commission, and the supply of which will it is hoped he regarded as a proper object for normal commercial credits* 5. Statement 'D' shows the government requirements for factory machinery and tools and raw materials required for factories, the total cost of which amounts to ID. 646,000 the purchase of these items could it is presumed also he dealt with under the heading of commercial credits* 6. The esteemed Embassy will find from the contents of these statements that the Ministry of Defence needs for Defence purpose sums totalling ID* 3,252,490 for the purchase of second-hand guns and ammunition, new arms and ammunition and other war materials and factories and their requirements of raw materials* The Ministry of Defence are in urgent need of the above war stores in order to enable them to remedy within a short period, the deficiencies in their establishments. They also intend setting up factories for the manufacture of gun ammunition at as early a date as possible. The firm of Messrs. Greenwood and Batley have submitted their final /quotationsquotations for the cost of the establishment of such factories and are only av/aiting the final approval of the Ministry of Defence in order to proceed with the fulfilment of the orders. The Ministry request the esteemed Embassy to be so good as to cause His Britannic Majesty’s Government to be acquainted with these requirements. The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad. 13th April, 1939. AnmMHH ^ I*f2- STRICTLY SECRST.

P No* 41 Saving. 0i0:0:0:0:0:0 You will have seen from my despatch No. 158/E that Ira^i Government’s credit requirements cover not only current expenditure and future development hut also past commitments. I realise that even with all possible despatch it may take a little time for His Majesty’s Government to decide what facilities they can offer and meanwhile Iraq’s financial difficulties (not, as the correspondence shows, entirely through her own fault) grow daily more acute* I hope Sir Basil Newton will be able to see Mr, Hogg (who is now in London) and discuss the matter with him* More is at stake than mere finance. We are fighting to retain Iraq's faith in our capacity and willingness as an ally to lend her assistance when as now she is in need of it, and as I explained in paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 133 p fche Germans are dangling tempting offers before her which they ^ould doubtless be able to implement without delay if they were accented. (Ree also General Waterhouse’s reply to your telegram No. 151, contained in my telegram No. 155). Critical international situation has engendered here a natural feeling of impatience and nerviness at weakness of/of Iraq’s position both as regards finance and armaments. This feeling v/ill not, I fear, be much relieved by the knowledge that in the event of war the United Kingdom may lend Iraq certain material assistance (your despatch No. 150). Iraqis will feel that once war has broken out such assistance, although useful, will have difficulty in catching up with the rapid march of events. Nor from our own point of view (though this may be a secondary consideration) will assistance in that form have the political and moral value that it would have if extended in time of peace. In these circumstances I have been wondering whether, pending His Majesty’s Government ’ s'-ieeci si on on the credit question and the outbreak (which one naturally hopes will not oc'cur) of war, some gesture is not desirable that would at the same time tend to relieve Iraqis’ doubts and fears, as well as their material difficulties, and serve our mutual interests. Two suggestions occur to me (1) an immediate loan of say £1,000,000 ( not issued by Barings, who are as you are aware suspect to the Iraqis) to meet the Iraqi Government’s most pressing cash requirements, especially local contractors’ accounts, and (2) the immediate transfer, g ratis , to the Iraqi Government of the seven hundred thousand pounds’ worth of second-hand guns and ammunition to be supplied from obsolescent War Office stocks (see paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 158/E and Statement ’’A' attached to the Chancery’s letter to the Eastern Department of April l5th^ With regard to (1) it should be borne in mind that local commitments in respect of public works (mainly railway construction) which are not normally covered by export credits, are expected anyhow to exceed/' 'MAM - &lt; ■ . '.\A0*r+' exceed revenue from oil royalties during the current year. With regard to (2), such a transfer % ,T ould serve our mutual interests since Iraqi Government are anxious to obtain this material without delay and are strongly supported in this respect by the Military Mission who are much disturbed by the deficiencies, particularly in ammunition, with which the Iraqi Army would be faced if they were involved in war in the near future. I am the more attracted by these suggestions in view of my desire, which I feel sure you share, that the new Ambassador should take up his position here in the most favourable atmosphere. You will have realised from my telegram No. 133 that he comes at a difficult time. Iraq has for one reason or another been led away from the path of sane and sober progress and requires steadying, and it is principally through a sympathetic and helpful response to her requests to us for assistance that we can best assist in that process and at the same time restore her faith (sadly shaken by recent events) in our material as opposed to purely moral value as an ally. If Sir Basil Newton can bring with him some indication or promise of immediate assistance in the matter of finance and war material it will, I feel sure lend weight to his influence here. If he bears no such message his contacts with the Iraqi Government cannot but begin in an atmosphere which, though doubtless friendly, will nevertheless reflect their disillusionment.Register No. P.

Without 29b 1000 5.31 British/British support its independence was threatened from 3 quarters; from the great Tribes, Turkey and Iran. If Iraqi policy was not to bring about its own Kemesis, Great Britain should take more effective steps to strengthen the conservative pro-British elements in Iraq which, without British support^aSe powerless in the face of Representative Bagdad observes that Abdul Kader Gaylani himself belongs to those elements which he urges the British Government to support, and questions whether his pro-British sympathies would remain once those elements were returned to power. The growing hostility among the youth of Iraq to Great Britain is unfortunately not to be denied. What remains^howeve^the fundamental obstacle to an improvement in Anglo-Iraqi relations is not youthful extremism or foreign propaganda so much as the situation in Palestine. Submitted for inf o mat ion. foreign propaganda and youthfulCopy (E 4564/474/93) No. 731. ^529/13/39) VERY CONFIDENTIAL. (Tsl) f f BRITISH EMBASSY, CAIRO, 16th June, 1939. My Lord, I have the honour to report that Saiyid ALdul Kader Gaylani, who is about to leave Cairo after having been Chargd d f Affaires of Iraq here for over seven years, called on the Oriental Secretary on the 16th June and expounded with great earnestness his views on the situation in Iraq. 2, He said that he viewed with the utmost anxiety the situation there* Nuri Pasha was practically dominated by a committee of five not very senior officers in the Iraq Army, and the present rdgime was really only another form of that instituted by Bakr Sidky, namely the rdgime of Army juntas. The Minister of Defence and the Chief of the Staff were puppets in the hands of this committee. Nuri Pasha held on by distributing posts right and left to keep people quiet and by taking up his present demagogic attitude regarding Palestine and Syria. Had it not been for his insistence on refusing the White Paper policy, Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha would, according to Abdel Kader Gaylani, have been prepared to accept it. The result of...ft / of the policy of Nuri and preceding Iraq Governments was disastrous. They played up for popular support by espousing anti-British or anti-French movements in Iraq regarding Palestine and Syria. A continuance of this sort of thing was exceedingly dangerous owing to its effect on the youth of the country who would gradually be growing up in an atmosphere which made it seem normal for Iraqis to regard Great Britain as the enemy. German propaganda no doubt took advantage of this situation to promote this anti-British tendency. The day might well come when this political demagogy would get the better of the common sense still restraining the leaders and involve Iraq in an anti-British movement which must end in disaster. 3, It was absolutely necessary, he said, to explain to the people that Britain*s need of Iraq was slight compared with that of Iraq for Great Britain. It was quite obvious to anyone that the great tribes of Iraq only obeyed the Iraq Government because they thought that the latter enjoyed the support of the British ally. The moment Great Britain disinterested herself in the Iraq Government the tribal situation would get completely out of hand. Moreover, it was equally evident that Turkey was waiting to get possession•of Mosul, which she had not ceased to covet, and Iran to lay her hands on Southern Mesopotamia, which for centuries had been the object of her desire as the country which contained the seat of the SassanidUPPI mm Sassanid Empire and the Holy Cities of Shiism* A carefully adapted propaganda should be able to bring this situation home to the Iraqis and make them realise that their precarious national existence depended solely on British goodwill. 4. What was necessary, he said, was that Great Britain should cease to play such an effaced r61e in Iraq. The difference in this respect, he observed, between Iraq and Egyp^ had struck him very greatly. In Egypt no Egyptian believed that England was not the real steadying force in the country and the power behind any Government. It was true that since the Treaty Great Britain did not intervene in internal political affairs and insist on appointments and transfers of certain officials, etc., etc. Nevertheless all Egyptians believed that the Government of the day took the advice of the British on all major questions affecting the security of the country. This, however, he said, was far from the case in Iraq. Iraqis had got it into their heads that Great Britain no longer counted in the internal situation and that they could now play recklessly without fear of British hindrance. 5. Mr. Smart suggested that perhaps the situation in Egypt was due to the fact that the Egyptians were faced v/ith an obvious danger on their frontier and were therefore better disposed to co-operate v/ith Great Britain in their immediate interest. But Abdel Kader Gaylani argued that Iraq’s need of England, as described above, was • • •was far greater than Egypt's. Moreover, the danger of England’s abandoning Iraq was much greater than that of her abandoning Egypt, v/hich, owing to the buez Canal, must always be a fundamental British preoccupation. 6. Abdel Kader Gaylani said that there were in Iraq a number of moderate conservative elements amongst families long established in Iraq, such as his own and that of Abdel Mohsin, who had co-operated with Great Britain during the 1921-1928 period and made possible an Iraq in close friendship with Great Britain. If only these elements could feel that they had the support of Great Britain,they would be prepared to work for a sounder and more frieridly rdgime in Iraq. Unsupported they could do nothing. They were always in danger of being dragged before military tribunals or even being assassinated if they took up an attitude of frank co operation with Great Britain. If, however, the anti- British anddemagogic agitators realised that Great Britain was really behind these elements, the former would be afraid to take such action against them. 7. Mr. Smart emphasised the obvious difficulties in the way of adopting the attitude suggested after the conclusion of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, Saiyed Abdul Kader Gaylani, however, refused to be convinced and again pointed to the Egyptian parallel. 8. Saiyid Abdel Kader Gaylani was anxious to remain here and is disgruntled at his supersession by Sabih Nejib, who has just been appointed Iraq Minister in Cairo...Cairo. No doubt he is displeased with Nuri Pasha on this account, and his remarks about the conservative families in Iraq may be dictated by a natural desire to promote the interests of his own family and caste. Nevertheless he has been unfailingly friendly to us during his sojourn in Egypt and, in the Palestinian affair particularly, has gone out of his way to try and bring the Palestinians to reason. Prom our long experience of him here I believe that he is sincerely convinced that the only hope of stability and national survival for Iraq is in close co-operation with Great Britain. There is no doubt also that for some time he has been seriously troubled by the developments of the internal situation in Iraq which he sees drifting towards anarchy and foreign encroachment, 9. The Oriental Secretary refrained carefully from any expressions of opinion and suggested that he had better talk over such matters with His Majesty 1 s Ambassador in Bagdad. Maybe Abdel Kader Gaylani does not realise fully that the Iraqis are a more turbulent people than the Egyptians, and therefore are not so amenable to being influenced by indirect methods• 10. He has applied for leave and proposes to proceed to Greece for a rest. He states that he was offered the post of Counsellor at Angora or of Iraq Consul at Jerusalem, but that he refused both. He proposes.,•- mam proposes to return to Iraq, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hut may, he said, retire from the Diplomatic Service and remain as a private individual in Bagdad* Judging by the general tenour of his remarks he may he contemplating the possibility of playing a political rdle in his own country.

O, British Embassy, Bagdad. 5th July, 1939. * My Lord, In his despatch No. 731 (529/13/39) of June 16th, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo reported to Your Lordship certain views on the situation in Iraq which the Iraqi Charge d*Affaires had recently expounded to the Oriental Secretary. I think it may be of value to comment on one or two of Saiyid Abdul Kadir Gailani’s principal observations. 2. In the first place I am inclined to wonder whether Abdul Kadir Gailani would have spoken in the way he did if he had not received orders transferring him from his post at Cairo. His criticisms of the Government in Iraq are, I am told, of a kind which is frequently voiced by prominent men who have personal reasons for dissatisfaction with the contemporary administration. They are very much the sort of thing that General Nuri Said used to say to his English friends when he was? in exile in Cairo. It is noteworthy, however, that men who, when out of office, show such a keen desire for the strengthening of British control in Iraq seldom do anything effective to give expression to this desire when in power. Nor have those who in private constantly urge Great Britain to play a more active r61e in the internal affairs oi Iraq ever publicly advocated/advocated that His Majesty’s Government should he invited to act in such a manner or openly opposed the activities of those who would see British influence in this country still further reduced. Men of this kind would, it seems, like to have British influence on tap to turn on to help them personally whenever they get into difficulties with their own people, hut would he the first to denounce it whenever it came into conflict with their own plans or ambitions. 3* One of Abdul Kadir’s remarks to which, whatever the immediate occasion for it, I attach importance is that the youth of the country were growing up in an atmosphere in which it seemed normal for Great Britain to he regarded as the enemy of Iraq. This, I fear, is to a large extent true. It is, however, a state of affairs which must he attributed to the prolonged struggle of the Arabs in Palestine against the policy of His Majesty’s Government and the sympathy which that struggle has aroused in this country, rather than to the ’political ’demagogy’ of General Nuri who has, I believe, on the contrary, done much to damp down agitation about Palestine in Iraq and to check the activities of the Palestine Defence League. 4. The fundamental fact is that, on account of the situation in Palestine* people here read and hear far more of Great Britain as the oppressor of the Arabs and the enemy of Arab liberties than they do of Britain as the creator and preserver of independent Iraq. The fact that, without British support and protection, Iraq would certainly be parcelled out among her neighbours is all too little understood. The moral may be, as Abdul Kadir Gailani suggests, that more propaganda is required to make the Iraqis realise the true position of their country/country. I shall certainly use every opportunity to impress the facts on those with whom I come into personal contact* 5* I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo.

The Amir was Iraqi Minister in Berlin when I was Counsellor there and seems to remember that fact to my advantage. 2. Whether or not he has forgiven, forgotten or never known the strictures passed on him and his wife by General Nuri reported in Mr. Houstoun-Boswall*s telegram No. 122 of 6th April, 1939, His Royal Highness spoke well of the present Cabinet saying that its members constituted the best Government available and that it would be a pity if they were overthrown. Madfai was personally not bad but as Prime Minister had been too weak. The Amir said he warned those with whom he spoke of the bad effect likely to be produced, especially abroad, by too many changes. 3. His Royal Highness seemed a little uneasy as to the prospects. He was not at all explicit but I gathered he shared the common view that a Government in Iraq is always weaker after an election, since the number of the disappointed exceeds that of the satisfied. He explained further that while the people as a whole were praiseworthy, they talked too much politics in the coffee-shops and were inclined to be restless/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.,restless. It was one of the reasons for Hitler's success that he kept the youth and indeed the whole population of Germany, including now the women, 'busy with every kind of distraction and occupation, so that they had no surplus time or energy for politics. The Youth Movement in Iraq (Tutua) was, he thought, good, as it gave the youth healthy occupation and discipline. On the other hand, the young officers were much too inclined to political discussions in which they engaged daily in their club in Bagdad. The Amir said he had drawn the attention of the Minister of Defence to this danger and suggested that the club should be transferred out of the town where young officers would only get into bad habits, whether of political or other forms of dissipation. I was the more struck by his reference to the behaviour of the junior officers, as I had heard from another source in Bagdad that army intrigues emanated from the younger officers paragraph 2 of Sir Miles Lampson's despatch No. 731 of 16th June. 4. In a previous conversation the Amir referred to his experiences during his recent visit to Germany. He had apparently not been very favourably impressed and said that a good deal of discontent and uneasiness had been expressed to him when his informants had discovered that they could safely unbosom themselves to him as a foreigner. I have etc., (Sd) Basil Newton. i —i ! i yTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ■ EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4476/72/93] June 22, 1939. Section 1. Copy No. Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—(Received June 22.) (No. 299.) My Lord. Bagdad, June 16, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 75, Saving, of the 9th June, I have the honour to inform you that the new Parliament was opened by the Regent on the 12th June. 2. A translation of the Speech from the Throne is given in the enclosed cutting from the Iraq Times.(') Apart from the friendly reference to the friendship and alliance between our two countries, it contained two interesting points. The first was the statement that the recently concluded Anglo-Turkish Agreement had increased stability in the Near East, and had furthered co-opera tion against any aggression which might endanger peace in this part of the world. The second concerned Palestine. This was of considerable importance and, as the translation given in the Iraq Times is not altogether adequate, I quote the full text of this part of the speech below :— Our Government continue to give their closest and most sympathetic consideration to the questions which are engaging the attention of our neigh bours. The work of our delegation, and that of other Arab delegations, at London resulted, as you know, in the publication of the white paper about Palestine. In our opinion, if that paper had contained a clear and positive statement which would have helped to an understanding of the intentions of the British Government concerning the creation of national govern ment in Palestine and the suppression of the political aspirations of zionism, those doubts and fears would have been diminished which, to our regret, continue to create unrest and to cause the most regrettable incidents in that dear land which is the centre of the hopes of all Arabs and Moslems ! ” 3. These words confirm the line taken by the Prime Minister and others, including the Regent, with whom I have spoken, that the cool reception given to the policy of the white paper is, in the main, due to the fact that the Arabs fear that it will not be carried out. In other words, if it had been possible for the white paper in some way to have dispelled Arab fears that the Jews will find a means to defeat its provisions, it would have been far more acceptable to the Arab world. The rest of the speech was devoted to somewhat colourless observations on home affairs and calls for no comment. 4. On the day of the opening of Parliament, the local press published a statement by the Prime Minister on the recent general election. He said that as the Electoral Law had not yet been amended, there had been no alterna tive but to conduct the election in the usual manner. He hoped, however, that this would be the last time that such elections would be held. The present Parliament would amend the Electoral Law to meet the desire of the people for free elections. Having done this, Parliament would again be dissolved and elections would be held under the new law. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India. 1 99 _L ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 153 of the 11th April, I have the honour to submit the following report on the ceTemonies organised in Bagdad on the occasion of the fortieth and final day of mourning for the late King Ghazi, which fell on Sunday, the 14th May. 2. Delegations representing Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt and Transjordan began to arrive on the 12th May, and by the appointed day about 150 men, of whom many were well-known public figures, had gathered in Bagdad. They included Abdul Rahman Bey Azzam (the Egyptian Minister here, who has just resumed his duties after a year’s absence), Hamad Pasha-al-Basil, and Ali Bey-al-Jarim from Egypt; Lutfi Haffar, Fakhri Barudi, Sa’dullah Jabari, Sulaiman Ahmad (the poet Badawi-al-Jabal) and Maruf Arhauti from Syria; Shibli Mallat and Yusuf Khazan from the Lebanon; Abdullah-al-Saqqaf and Mithqal Pasha-al-Faiz from Transjordan; and Jemal Hussaini, Husain Khalidi, Alfred Rock and Akram Zuaitar from Palestine. All the delegates were treated as guests of the Government and comfortably accommodated in the best hotels in Bagdad. 3. The principal gathering, that of the Ta’bin (or lamentation and praising of the dead) was held in the Town Hall at 3-30 o’clock in the afternoon of the 14th May. Certain members of the Diplomatic Corps were invited and I attended, together with the oriental secretary and the acting consul. The proceedings consisted of an opening speech by the Prime Minister, followed by fourteen alternated speeches and poems delivered by members of the foreign delegations. The Prime Minister’s speech was proper and pertinent to the occasion, but most of the other speakers and poets soon changed their pseans of praise of the late King Ghazi for strident chords in the pan-Arab key. Some went further and indulged in dramatic grief for the sufferings of Palestine. Akram Zuaitar, the well-known Palestinian Arab agitator (who has recently been given an appointment under the Iraqi Ministry of Education), was the worst offender, and I enclose herein a translation of his oration^ 1 ) which the audience had the good taste to receive in silence. I was given the gist of it by Captain Holt, and so was in a position to tell the Prime Minister in the evening, when we met at a party, in unmistakable language precisely what I thought of these proceedings cc in honour of the late King,” to whose memory only a bare half-hour had been devoted out of a solid two and a half hours of oratorical effort; and when he talked of cc safety-valves ” and Hyde Park, reminded him that it was not my Government’s habit to invite foreign diplomats to go there on Sunday afternoon, 4. The following morning, when I handed to him a copy of the main points of the white paper on Palestine, I used the opportunity officially to express my surprise that he should have allowed such a speech to have been delivered at a gathering to which the Diplomatic Corps had been invited to honour the memory of the late King Ghazi. I reminded him, moreover, that, before accepting the invitation to attend, I had asked for and obtained from the Director of Ceremonies in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs an assurance that no political or nationalist speeches would be delivered. The Prime Minister looked sheepish and mingled mumbled apologies with remarks to the effect that he did not think that Zuaitar’s speech was so objectionable as I had evidently been told it was. Nevertheless, he had, he said, reprimanded the convening committee; that Nuri Pasha had been shocked by what had been said was confirmed to me by the Regent. EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL.

The Ta'bin speeches, &amp;c., were broadcast and listened to eagerly by large crowds in the coffee shops, where a radio receiving set has now become an indispensable equipment. Akram Zuaitar’s speech, I am told, was followed with tense interest and stirred listeners to loud expressions of enthusiastic approval. 6. In the evening the delegates were entertained by the Prime Minister and the next afternoon they attended a garden-party given in their honour by His Highness the Regent. On the 16th May the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave another garden-party for the delegates, to which the Diplomatic Corps were again invited. 7. Throughout the stay of the delegates in Bagdad everything was clearly done to make the most of the occasion to foster among those present the ideal of Arab unity and to develop the prestige of Iraq and the Hashimite House in the Arab world. Speaker after speaker at the various gatherings glorified the achievements of Kings Hussain, Faisal and Ghazi, and declared that Arab hopes for the future were centred on the infant King Faisal II. No mention was at any time made of King Abdul Aziz, and I wonder what my Saudi Arabian colleague must be thinking of these panegyrics of the Royal House which His Majesty had so summarily ejected from their kingdom. 8.

My Lord, With reference to the comments on the growth of the School cadet movement which I have made in several recent despatches, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that new School Cadet Regulations were published in the Iraqi Gazette on May 15th, 2. The first article declares that the object of the Cadet organisation is to accustom the boys to hardship and hard work and to develop among them manly and martial ideals through military training in all its branches. 3. The regulations then go on to stipulate that all intermediate and secondary schools shall be included in the Cadet organisation and that all primary schools shall be covered by regulations for scouts which will be published later. 4. The style of the Minister of Education is in translation M The Prince of Chivalry' and that of the Director- General is 'Protector of Chivalry' ! All school teachers are to be incorporated in the Cadets as officers. Those receiving salaries of £42 a month and upwards will be called Superintendents and, according to senority, will wear one, two or three gold braids with a crossed sword and pen on their shoulder-straps. Teachers receiving from £18 to £36 a month will be called Knights (1st, 2nd and 3rd class) and their badge of rank will be one, two or three gold braids without the crossed sword and pen. Teachers earning/ 1© earning £15 and less a month will be called Helpers and will have as badges of rank gold braids narrower in width than those worn by the Knights. 5. The number of hours to be devoted weekly to military training and the uniform to be worn by masters and cadets are left to the decision of the Ministry of Education, but the Regulations provide that the Ministry shall arrange for all cadets to attend a summer training camp for not more than one month each year. 6. It is also stipulated that no boy shall be considered to have passed the annual school examination if he fails to satisfy the examiners in the prescribed military subjects. I have , etc., (signed) W.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3014/72/93] April 25, 1939. Section Mr. Houstoun-Boswall to Viscount Halifax.—(Received April 25.) (No. 176.) My Lord, Bagdad, April 19, 1939. Uo WITH reference to my despatch No. 131 of the 30th March, with which I transmitted to your Lordship a copy of the programme of the present Iraqi Cabinet, I have the honour to submit the following report on certain administra tive measures recently adopted by the Government. 2. In the Ministry of the Interior the plan of subjecting senior officials to an examination in general knowledge, which was mentioned in Sir Maurice Peterson’s despatch No. 70 of the 14th February, has apparently been dropped and another scheme for weeding out inefficient and unwanted officials has been substituted. _ m • i 3. Bv an ordinance issued on the 28th March, amending the State Officials Discipline Law of 1936, the Government have taken powers to suspend officials for any period up to five years by resolution of the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the minister concerned. Committees have been set up in each ministry to examine the service records of senior officials and to make recommendations for action under this ordinance. 4. Instructions have also been issued to all ministries carefully to prepare lists of officials who have reached the age limit with a view to their being placed on pension. 5. In the Ministry of Education, Saiyid Sami Shaukat (a brother of the Minister of the Interior) has been appointed Director-General (he previously held the post of Director-General of Health). He is fostering in the schools, with Nazi methods, an enthusiasm for pan-Arab ideals. The number of hours devoted to military drill in the secondary schools has been increased, and the boys are being encouraged to wear uniform as often as possible. The teachers are also being brought into the school cadet movement and uniforms and rank have been provided for them. As an additional stimulus to militant patriotism, Saiyid Sami Shaukat has himself delivered a number of impassioned speeches to gatherings of school boys in which he has exhorted them to be ready to give their lives in the Arab cause. 6. He aims also at attracting scholars to Iraq from other Arab countries. With this end in view, the regulations of the medical college have been amended to permit the admission of non-Iraqi Arab students up to a total of one-sixth of the number of new students admitted each year. 7. The new director-general has also encouraged all students and school-boys to take an organised part in public demonstrations. Columns of school-boys in uniform, marching through the streets with banners bearing political slogans, have been a prominent feature in recent demonstrations, and school-boys were the leaders of the attack on the Mosul Consulate on the 4th April. 8. I have pointed out to the Prime Minister the dangerous absurdity of encouraging school-boys to believe that their military training has a political object just at the time when responsible Iraqi statesmen are doing their utmost to keep the army out of politics. He agreed with me, but as good as admitted that the Shaukats (Naji Shaukat, Minister of the Interior, Sami Shaukat, Director- General of Education, and Saib Shaukat, Director of the Bagdad Hospital and leader of the Muthanna Club) were too strong for him. 9. In the army the purge begun with the arrests made under martial law in March (see Sir Maurice Peterson’s telegram No. 81 of the 17th March) has been completed by the enforced retirement on pension of twenty-seven officers of the army and air force. These officers include Akram Mushtaq, the Officer Commanding the Iraqi Air Force, who is still Director of Civil Aviation, and two army colonels. [580 bb—1]2 10. The Iraqi air force was reorganised early in April on lines approved by the British Military Mission. v 11. A recent order that officers below field rank should wear unilotm when off duty is a sign of the influence of £&lt; Shaukatism in the arnyy. . „ 12. The Bagdad wireless station has been taken over from the Ministry ot Education by the Ministry of the Interior and placed under the conti ol of the Director of Public Press Publicity. This is a medium-wave station with a very limited range. The powerful short-wave station at Qasar-al-Zuhur has been presented to the Government by the Regent, but it is not yet being operated. 13.

My Lord, Uitft reference to say despatch So. 176 of Atril 19th, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a summary of a speech broadcast by the rime Minister from the Bagdad station on the evening of *pril 29th. 2. The speech opened with a reference to two measures which the government had prepared for early submission to Parliament; a iwa Administration Law and a Law Azaending the Electoral Law. His excellency stated that the purpose of the first would be to decentralize the control of the principal public services, particularly education and public health, ana that of the second to ensure to the electorate freeaoa to choose their representatives without official or other interference. X should mention that these laws were in fact conceived by Jamil Madfai’s Cabinet as reported to Your Lordship in Sir aurice Peterson’s despatch Ho. 70 of February 14th. The rime Minister also promised that the government would purge the public services of inefficient and corru t officials. He no doubt had in mind the ordinance* mentioned in paragraph 3 of my despatch under reference• The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax,3* His Excellency went on f in the manner ijndicated in tjie 1 19 enclose; press Kurcmery , to make a bittei* indi$e elements which he alleged were continually working against the real interests of Iraq. During this part of the speech (which lasted for nearly half-an-hour) the rime Minister seemed to be doing his best to imitate the declamatory style of Herr Hitler, to whose Heiohatag speech it may be assumed he had listened the day before. The .natter of hie speech however offered little excuse for such treatment and his passionate denunciation of the faults of the long forgotten Committee of Union and regress was heard with surprise by listeners* His emotion when speaking of events connected with the ciurdar of Jafar-el- Askari in 1936 was more understandable, but private commentators have pointed out that though Jafar asha’s death was no doubt a deeply felt personal tragedy for Nuri-al-Said, it has never been regarded as a great national disaster. 4 . Generally, it seems that people are disposed to shrug their shoulders doubtfully about the speech and to hint that it reveals that the Prime Minister is likely to find a stronger inspiration for his policy in his private feelings than in considerations based uoon the public interest. 5 .

My Lord, With reference to my despatch No . 218 of the 28th April reporting the visit of Naji Shaukat, Iraqi Minister of the Interior, to Angora, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that, in the course of a talk with the Counsellor of this Embassy, the Minister said that the President of the Turkish Republic had given him a solemn assurance that Turkey had no designs on Syria, or any intention of attacking Syria. 2. The Minister expressed to Mr. Morgan his concern about Syria. Arabs, as a whole, he said, had hoped that Turkey would have agreed to a partition of the Hatay between Turkey and Syria, leaving Antioch to Syria, but Atatilrk had firmly veto-ed the notion, and the Arabs accepted his verdict. It now appeared to Naji Shaukat that Prance was ready to acquiesce in the union of Hatay to Turkey, on condition that the sea and bind frontiers of Syria were jointly guaranteed by Turkey and Prance, and his view was that Iraqi opinion would strongly resent a Turco-French guarantee of the Syro-Iraq frontier. Passing to the Syro- Prench treaty of 1936, Naji Shaukat emphasised that an early ratification of this treaty by Prance was essential. it . would be indifferent to Syria if France maintained military forces/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G.,G.C.S.1.,G.C.1.E., ©t C • ^ ©”bc»j G C C oJ forces in Syria after the ratification, for Syria would have obtained the great boon of its b dependence• If France did not ratify the treaty, and continued to keep Syria split up into small States, with priestly influence dominating her attitude towards Syria, there would be, according, to Naji Shaukat, trouble in Syria far exceeding any in Palestine, with consequent free play for German and Italian intrigue, and with harmful results on the attitude of the whole Arab world* Ratification, on the other hand, would rally all Arabs to the French and British cause.

My Lord, Bagdad, April 4, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 86 of the 23rd March, I have the honour to report that, during a visit which I paicT to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 28th March, General Nuri-al-Said informed me that he had received a telegram from the Iraqi Minister in London reporting a conversation with your Lordship. Rauf Chadirji had stated that you had discussed with him recent events in Europe and had enquired about the attitude of the Iraqi Govern ment towards their obligations under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. Nuri- al-Said added that when Rauf Beg's report was received he had decided to refer the whole matter to the Cabinet so that, with the agreement of his colleagues, instructions might be sent to the Iraqi Minister indicating in what manner he should reply to the oral communication which you had made to him. He had accordingly prepared a memorandum for the Cabinet, to which he had attached the Minister's report, and he handed me a copy of this memorandum, together with a copy of the instructions which the Cabinet, after a special meeting, had decided to send to Rauf Beg. I enclose a translation of each of these documents. 2. The first part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' memorandum sets out the considerations which led King Ghazi to hold the meeting at the palace on the 23rd March, which I reported in my telegram under reference. The memorandum then refers to the report from the Iraqi Minister in London on his conversation with your Lordship, and proposes that the Minister should be instructed to speak to you in the same manner in wdiich King Ghazi and his Ministers had spoken to me concerning the attitude of Iraq towards the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. 3. The text of the instructions actually drawn up by the Cabinet is, I consider, not unsatisfactory. Nuri Pasha was at pains to impress on me that it was intended that the statement with which they commence should be absolutely unequivocal, and he did not wish it to be thought that the determination of the Iraqi Government to fulfil their treaty obligations was in any way conditional upon the further observations which Rauf Beg had been instructed to make. The anxiety of the Iraqi Government regarding the situation in Syria and Palestine arose not only from their deep fellow-feeling for the Arabs in those two countries, but also from their sure knowledge that until tranquillity had been restored in Syria and Palestine it would be impossible for any Govern ment in Iraq to bring the country wholeheartedly into line with Great Britain in an international crisis. 4. I had not at that time received the instructions contained in your tele gram No. 92 of the 29th March (with which I have since complied). I did not, therefore, discuss the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Syrian situation, but confined my remarks to an expression of my satisfaction that the Iraqi Government had once more so readily and so clearly declared their fidelity to the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. 5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then turned to the second and third paragraphs of his memorandum to the Cabinet. He said that in the last reports received from Taufiq Suwaidi the latter had seemed most hopeful that His Majesty’s Government would satisfy the Arab desires in the few outstanding matters regarding Palestine, and Nuri Pasha said that he felt happier than he had done for some time about the situation in that country. 6. As regards the third paragraph of the memorandum, the Minister for Foreign Affairs quite frankly told me that he and his colleagues had come to the conclusion that they could not advise their Syrian friends (who were constantly f 580 m —3] b2 asking them for guidance) how to act until they had found out whether Turkey was nursing ambitions in regard to Syria. What they feared was that if the Syrians boldly resisted French efforts to scrap the treaty of 1936, the Turks might well find an opportunity to take another Syrian province for themselves. It had therefore been decided to depute a member of the Government to to Angora in order to sound the Turkish Government on this subject. He sa£3^ that he himself had much wanted to go, but he recalled that some days earlier, when he had spoken of going on a mission to Turkey, I had urged him not to leave Iraq at the resent juncture, and he paid me the compliment of claiming that it was in deference to my advice that he had decided to send Naji Shaukat, the Minister of the Interior, instead. He was finding it most difficult to deal with the Shaukat family and their extreme pan-Arab and pro-German views and would be quite pleased to be rid of Naji Shaukat for a while; he might even send him to Tehran for the royal wedding as well. The Prime Minister, however, does not feel that he will be able to place much reliance on Naji Shaukat as an observer in Turkey as, for all his pan-arabism, he is such an admirer of the Turks that the latter might well throw dust in his eyes as they did when he was Minister at Angora. 7. It was interesting to me, m view of the conversation recorded in your despatch No. 107 of the 24th February, to know that the Iraqi Government were still so apprehensive about Turkish designs on Syria, but I left Nuri Pasha in no doubt that, whatever reactions there might be to Naji Shaukat’s mission to Angora, it would be the gravest mistake for the Iraqi Government to encourage the Syrians to embark on a bitter struggle with the French. I have no hope, however, of having made any impression on his mind. The conviction that the failure of the Syrian Government to make good is due entirely to French trickerv is so deeply rooted in the Iraqi mind that it is useless to attempt to dislodge it with any argument. The delay of the French Government in ratifying the treaty signed in 1936 is regarded here as a final proof of French bad faith, and I fear that, if the Iraqi Government obtain in Angora the desired assurance that Turkey will not exploit disturbances in Syria for her own purposes, no advice will dissuade the leaders of the Arab movement in Iraq from encouraging the Syrians to fight for their liberty. 8 . During the last ten days I have have a good many informal visits from Nuri Pasha, in the course of which he has indulged in a great deal of thinking aloud about the internal situation. I do not propose to trouble your Lordship at present with all that the Prime Minister has said in the course of these long conversations, but it may be of interest to record that he is verv far from satisfied with the*present Minister of the Interior. He recalled that at one time, a good many years ago, he had had to work hard to kindle even a dim flame of enthusiasm for the Arab cause in Naji Shaukat’s Turkish-trained mind. Now he had become positively rabid, and carried his narrow fanatical views into every branch of his official work. “He is far more of a Nationalist now even than I am,” said the Prime Minister. Nuri claimed that, nevertheless, in his heart Nuji Shaukat knew he was wrong in maintaining, for example, that all British officials could be dispensed with, but that he felt this excessive nationalism was an easy path to cheap popularity and ignored what he did not wish to see; his characteristic method of dealing with all serious difficulties was to refuse to admit their existence. The Prime Minister said that he would be happy to be rid of him from the Cabinet, but he could not at present risk a quarrel with the Shaukat family. 9. I shall be grateful if Nuri Pasha’s reference to the internal situation may be treated as strictly confidential. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Angora, and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda] and also to the Government of India. I Y\f\ VP fvP W. E.

Memorandum by Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers. : ^*(Strictly Secret.) IT is requested that the following facts may be laid before the Council of Ministers for a decision thereon : — The increasingly disturbed general international situation in Europe tends to weaken the hope that the crises which have been succeeding one another would end without a world catastrophe involving all Powers. It is true that the clash may be put off for a few months or even for a couple of years, but signs exist which indicate with certainty that it is bound ultimately to occur. As Iraq is bound up with Great Britain by means of an alliance imposing upon her, should Britain become engaged in war, certain obligations laid down in paragraph 4 of the annexure to the Treaty of Alliance, and. as at the same time Iraq also has obligations, of a nature not less important than those devolving upon her under the said treaty, towards neighbouring Arab countries who are still awaiting the attainment of the independence promised them long ago by mandatory Powers, by which we mean the promises of France and Great Britain with reference, respectively, to Syria and Palestine (in which two countries it is to be deeply regretted conditions have so considerably worsened as to arouse deep public anxiety in Iraq), His Majesty the King felt compelled to hold a special meeting with his ministers on the 23rd March, 1939, at which it was decided to invite the attention of the allied Government of Britain to the following questions :— (a) The necessity of mediation on the part of the British Government with the French Government to secure the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, and the necessity of an understanding with the leaders of the National Block party. (b) The necessity of expediting the settlement of the remaining outstanding matters concerning the Palestine question, and of exerting efforts for the restoration of stable conditions and peace in Palestine, the removal of causes of complaint and estrangement and the cessation of the continuous acts of destruction which arise from the ambiguous policy at present pursued in that country. (c) The establishment of a friendly atmosphere to replace the misunder standing in regard to Koweit, and the removal of the influence of Iranian immigrants, as suggested by His Majesty the King to the British Ambassador before the latter’s departure from Bagdad. Following on the above decision, the Charge d’Affaires at the British Embassy was summoned to the Boyal Court, where, in my presence and that of the Ministers of Defence and Finance, His Majesty brought up before the charge d affaires the above three questions with a view to a satisfactory agreement being reached regarding them before the crisis in Europe had assumed a more serious phase such as might involve the British Government in a war, whereupon Iraq would be bound to fulfil her obligations towards her ally as provided for in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance alluded to above. The charge d’affaires promised immediately to communicate these representations to His Britannic Majestv and his Government. In view of the nature of the contents of a telegram received from the Iraqi Minister in London, of which a copy is attached, it is suggested that our minister in London should reply to the observations of the British Foreign Minister in accordance with the principles enumerated above, and that he should also make further endeavours in London to achieve the acceptance of these principles emphasising at the same time the harmful results which are bound to ensue from delay m the settlement of the above-mentioned questions. , 2- A . s regards the Palestine question, we got in touch with the Government of Saudi Arabia, informing them of the efforts exerted by us and asking them to exert similar efforts and inform us of the results. We have also received from the representatives of Iraq at the Palestine Conference a telegram communicating the text of certain proposals which have been agreed to by the Arab delegation? including, of course, the Palestine delegation, as it has'been the policy^of the [580 m—3] b ’ 2— ^ ^ SmHHI Vi delegations of the Arab Governments not to accept any P 1 P rlplpcrntions Palestinian delegation are unable to agree. Until recen \ a ^ n tlv maintained touch one with the other. It would appear tons, i W . 1V to received from London prove true, that the Palestine problem is oil solution, to be reached within the next few days, satisfactoi\ 0 1 ' ' of Palestine as well as to Arab Governments. 3. As to the Syrian question, there are two issues to this question, first issue is that relating to Alexandretta. The Syrians are now willing not to raise any question in regard to that territory and to leave the matter as one toi settlement between the Turkish Government and the French Repu it. second issue relates to the ratification of the treaty of 1936. and m this connexion we consider it highly necessary that the rights of the Syrians as laid down m that treaty, which ensures the unity of Syria, should be upheld, and that e partition, which is advocated by the new French policy, should be rejected. Having regard to the critical nature of the situation and to the need tor the expeditious determination of a sound line of action, we suggest that his Excellency the Minister of the Interior should be sent out on deputation to Turkey, at the earliest possible opportunity, there to interview the President of the Turkish Republic and get in touch with members of the Turkish Government with a view to ascertaining the exact nature of the intentions and attitude of the Turkish Republic in regard to the present situation in Syria. It is our opinion that the Syrians should not be encouraged to embark upon any definite action before the views of the 1 urks have been ascertained. If after studying the situation his Excellency the Minister of the Interior is fully satisfied that the Turks share our own views on this question, the Iraqi Government would then be able openly to support the Syrian cause in a more effective manner, whether before the British Government or before the French Government. We are also of opinion that Iraq should not plunge headlong in a policy the precipitate adoption of which might have for consequence the dismemberment of Syria. Actinq Minister for Foreign Affairs. Annex to Enclosure 1. Telegram from Iraqi Minister in London. March 25, 1939. LORD HALIFAX, the Foreign Minister, called for me to-day to discuss the international situation in Central Europe and the attitude of Russia and that of Roumania, and the circumstances under which the latter was impelled to declare her policy towards that situation. He told me that Great Britain’s policy in those circumstances was determined; he did not, however, state its nature. Great Britain had prepared the way for the settlement of Franco-1 tali an differences and the matter was mainly dependent on the speech to be made by Mussolini. He had interviewed the ambassadors of Turkey and Bulgaria and was satisfied with the position maintained by the Balkan Powers in connexion with the present crisis. Endeavours were being exerted for the settlement of the differences between Hungary and Roumania. He had devoted himself last week to an exploration of the situation in Central Europe and of the position of States directly affected by that situation. He now wished to be informed of the views of Arab Governments in treaty relations with Great Britain. Taking up the question of Palestine, he told me that the Egyptian Ambassador had informed him yesterday that it was possible to achieve peace in Palestine through the mediation of Arab States, provided the trifling points remaining unsettled at the conference negotiations were settled. I replied that I shared the Egyptian Ambassador’s opinion that it would be unfortunate to allow these points to remain unsettled, and that I would communicate to my Government his statements at the interview. Lord Flalifax professed ignorance of the results of yesterday’s talks which were communicated to you by A1 Suwaidi. I request your instructions. IRAQIYAH.IS# 5 Enclosure 2. histructions sent to Rauf Beg. I THE Iraqi Government desire that there should be no doubt left as to their determination to carry out their obligations in accordance with the Treaty of Alliance of 1930 between them and Great Britain. They consider, however, that, having regard to the disturbed international situation, the utmost endeavours should be exerted for the consolidation of peace and the tranquillisation of public opinion in neighbouring Arab countries, with the greatest possible expedition. They also consider it to be their unavoidable duty to invite the attention of their ally to the following questions which have been discussed already by His Majesty the King with the charge d’affaires of the British Embassy, Bagdad, in the presence of the Foreign Minister, and concerning which His Majesty has asked the charge d’affaires to communicate with his Government. The Iraqi Govern ment further consider it essential (a) that the British Government should at once use their good offices with the Government of the French Republic with a view to expediting the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty of 1936 and bringing about an understanding with leaders of the (Syrian) National Block Party; (b) that the remaining outstanding matters relating to the Palestine question should be rapidly settled; and (c) that the present misunderstandings in regard to the question of Koweit should be removed and that the influence of Iranian immigrants should be restricted. Please emphasise harmful consequences of delay.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GO^ERNIVtE^T^- EASTERN (Iraq). (CONFIDENTIAL. [E 2820/72/93] ■O' April 18, 2851 1939. Section T7 Copy No. 11 Mr. Houstoun-Bosuall to Viscount Halifax. — {Received A'pril 18.) (No. 153.) My Lord, Bagdad, A'pril 11, 1939. WITH reference to my unnumbered telegram of the 4th April despatched by wireless through the courtesy of the Air Officer Commanding, I have the honour to submit the following report on the death of the late King Ghazi I and the events which followed it. 2. The news of the accident which caused King Ghazi’s death first reached me through Dr. Sinderson, the late King’s physician, with whom I was talking in my house on the evening of the 3rd April when he was summoned urgently to the Palace. 3. Some hours later he returned and told me that while King Ghazi was himself driving from his private radio station to the Qasr-al-Zahur his car had collided with an electric light standard and that His Majesty had sustained in the collision injuries so serious that he had died about an hour afterwards. 4. The next morning the Government issued three communiques (of which I enclose copies taken from the Iraq Times of the 4th April). The first announced the death of King Ghazi, and the second contained a medical report on His Majesty’s death. The third proclaimed the accession to the throne of the young Crown Prince as Faisal II, the appointment of His Royal Highness the Amir Abdul Illah as Regent and the summoning of the recently-dissolved Parliament to reach a final decision upon the question of the Regency in accordance with article 22 of the Constitution. 5. King Ghazi’s body was removed to the Royal Court during the early hours of the morning of the 4th April, and throughout the afternoon and evening crowds of mourners marched slowly past the coffin. From early morning until late at night the main thoroughfares and squares of the town were crowded with mourners, wailing, beating their breasts and tearing their hair in the intensity of their grief. There were as many women and children as men among the crowds, and hundreds lay sobbing in the streets. 6. Malicious persons at once began to exploit the public emotion for their own ends, and tendentious rumours of all kinds were soon in circulation. One that was persistently repeated was the story that the English had killed the King. During the morning several young men were arrested while they were distributing typewritten handbills to this effect or making excited speeches to groups of mourners in which they wildly accused the British of the murder of the “ Arabs’ hero King.” 7. I am reporting separately the tragic results to which this criminal agitation led in Mosul, and in another despatch I am acquainting your Lordship with the information which I have gathered concerning the sources from whicti this agitation was inspired. 8. Another story sedulously fostered by unscrupulous mischief-makers was that Nuri-al-Said had murdered King Ghazi, and several groups of mourners were heard chanting the slogan : “ Thou shalt answer for the blood of Ghazi, O Nuri.” 9. The Royal funeral took place on the morning of the 5th April. The procession, admirably marshalled by Saiyid Tahsin-al-Qadri, the head of the Protocol Department, who with the help of a small inter-departmental committee had made all arrangements within only twenty-four hours, left the Royal Court punctually at 8 o'clock in the morning and proceeded slowly along the 2-mile route to the mausoleum near Adhamiyah. where King Ghazi was interred by the side of King Faisal I and King Ali of the Hejaz. I was accompanied by Captain Holt, and the Air Officer Commanding, attended by two staff officers, was also present. 10. The route was lined by thousands of people. Some stood and watched silently with tears streaming down their faces; others, mostly women, abandoned themselves to hysterical grief, rending their garments and covering their heads [580 s-1] ^ B2 and breasts with mud from the gutters. It was strange to see and hear soldiers and even policemen sobbing like children. At several points there was a danger that the pressure of the surging crowds would break down the police and military cordon, but reinforcements in motor cars were always at hand to save the situa tion, and the commandant of police and his officers worked indefatigably Uu maintain order. I was particularly impressed by the efficiency of the police 1 on motor cycles, who handled their vehicles with the greatest skill and were far more effective than their horse-mounted colleagues. 11. After the short burial service the Diplomatic Corps and other privileged mourners were escorted in their cars along a specially cleared route back to the town, the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department personally escorting my car and that of Air Vice-Marshal Tyssen as far as the gates of the embassy. 12. I had not before seen an Arab crowd in such a fever of hysteria. The scenes which I witnessed as I walked in the procession gave me a vivid impres sion of how the tragedy of Mosul must have been enacted the day before. What I saw also made me more than ever determined to impress upon the Prime Minister how dangerous this frenzied mourning would become unless it was checked and controlled. I accordingly sent that evening a short letter to his house urging him to hasten to restore calm and to suppress the false rumours which were still everywhere in circulation, and which had begun to be echoed even in Beirut and Damascus. (I have heard since that they were repeated in German broadcasts.) Reports from Basra and other provincial centres indicated that public excitement was dangerously high and was being worked up to an artificial pitch by official or semi-official encouragement. The following morning I sent the oriental secretary to give the Prime Minister a similar message orally and to enquire what measures were in fact being taken to calm public excitement. The results of the oriental secretary's interview with the Prime Minister were reported to your Lordship in my telegram No. 120. 13. On the 6th April the Senate and the dissolved Chamber of Deputies held a joint meeting to appoint a Regent in accordance with article 22 of the Constitution. The meeting took place at 3 o’clock in the afternoon and the proceedings were broadcast. The voting on the proposal that the Amir Abdul Illah should be appointed Regent during the young King Faisal’s minority was public, each Senator and Deputy standing up to declare himself for or against it. The result was an unanimous approval of the Amir’s appointment. His Royal Highness thereupon took the oath in the prescribed form, and the meeting was adjourned. I enclose a copy of the official communique (No. 7) issued on the proceedings. 14. Immediately after the meeting of Parliament the Prime Minister submitted the resignation of his Cabinet to the Regent and was requested to remain in office and to form a new Government. Nuri-al-Said thereupon reformed the same Cabinet and the necessary Irada was signed by the Regent. This was the last of the constitutional acts necessitated by King Ghazi’s death. 15. Article 22 of the Constitution provides that in the event of the throne passing to a minor the King’s prerogatives shall be exercised by a Regent chosen by the former King and approved by Parliament. King Ghazi himself, though he lived for over an hour after the fatal accident, never recovered consciousness and was therefore unable to express his wishes. After his death the Queen, who had at that time not recovered from the shock, was asked whether His Majesty had ever made a will. She affirmed that he had frequently declared his wish that if he should die before his son became of age the Amir Abdul Illah should become Regent, and she said that she thought that His Majestv might possibly have left something in writing to this effect. A few hours later the Queen Mother and the Princess Rajiha, the late King’s sister, repeated this statement on oath before the whole Cabinet, the Rais of the Royal Diwan and the Chief of the General Staff. The Amir Abdul Illah was thereupon declared Regent. A translation of the statement of the Queen Mother and the Princess is enclosed herein. I have heard nothing more of the document which the Queen Mother thought she might be able to find. As your telegram No. 112 did not reach me until the 5th April, the day after the appointment of the Amir Abdul Illah had been notified to me by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and published in the press, it would have been too late for me to have spoken to the Prime Ministerms ,C( ( 3 on the lines of your instructions, even if it had been possible to find an opportunity to do so in the midst of his overwhelming preoccupation with the highly dangerous situation created by the death of King Ghazi and the murder of His Majesty’s Consul at Mosul. s 16. Moreover, I had reason to believe that he and the Government had, in :act, considered the matter on its merits. He was aware that the Queen Mother had a special reason for preferring that her brother, the Amir Abdul Illah, should become Regent rather than the Amir Zeid, and he was quick to see that, for this reason, she might be tempted to be more positive in her assertions about the late King’s wishes than may have been justified by anything which His Majesty had in fact said. His personal inclination was, I suspect, towards the Amir Zeid, but he could foresee the dangers of a dispute and knew that a quick decision was vital. 17. Apart from these considerations, the factor which finally told against the Amir Zeid was, as I reported in my telegram No. 122, his wife. On analysis everyone seemed convinced that her defects (including her somewhat disreputable past) more than outweighed the advantages of age, experience and personality which the Amir Zeid may perhaps be said to have over the Amir Abdul Illah. At the meeting of former Prime Ministers and the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber, which the Prime Minister summoned to deliberate on the Regency question, only Jamil-al-Madfai urged the Amir Zeid’s claim with any ardour, but in the end he yielded to the opinion of the majority and the next day cast his own vote in Parliament for the Amir Abdul Illah. 18.

[E 2749/72/93] Co Py N(K Mr. Houstoun-Boswall to Viscount Halifax.—(Received April 14.) My Lord, Bagdad, March 30, 1939. WITH reference to my telegram No. 32, Saving , of the 22nd March, I think it may be well for me to give your Lordship” th^ following connected account ot the army plot which General Nuri recently discovered and suppressed in typical ^ energetic fashion. , . 2. It was at the beginning of March that he informed^ Sir Maurice 1 eterson that an army plot had been discovered to dethrone King Ghazi and replace him by His Majesty’s cousin, the Amir Abdul Illah. The latter, according to General Nuri’s account, had immediately revealed the conspiracy to the King s uncle, the Amir Zeid, who had in turn informed Taha-al-Hashimi, the Minister of Defence. Some dozen arrests were made, including that of Hikmat Sulaiman, who, as your Lordship is aware, participated in Bakr Sidqi’s coup d’Etat in 1936 and was Prime Minister in the Government which came into power as a result of it. Apart from Hikmat, the accused men consisted mainly of active or retired army officers who had in one way or another been associated with Bakr Sidqi s many acts of violence. A special military court, on which two of the five judges were civilians, was established at the Hinaidi (A1 Rashid) Camp on the 6th March; the press was placed under a military censorship; and the trials of the accused men commenced forthwith. 3. From the first it was evident that General Nuri was, in all these pro ceedings, concerned quite as much, if not more, with the past as with the present, and that he was seizing the opportunity of the plot to repay Hikmat (against whom he admitted that only the slightest evidence of complicity in the plot existed) for the latter’s part in the coup d’Etat of 1936, in which Nuri Pasha’s brother-in-law, Ja’far Pasha, had lost his life and Nuri himself had been obliged to flee the country. This fact lent a disturbing feature to the Government’s action with regard to the plot, since it was understood that General Nuri, on taking office at the end of last year, had assured Hikmat that the latter was in no danger, and it was therefore legitimate to hope that a term might be put at any rate to this aspect of the personal feuds and vendettas which have so long made for instability and weakness in the internal political structure of Iraq. Sir Maurice Peterson accordingly took this aspect of the matter up with General Nuri and pressed him strongly with a view to ensuring that there should be no victimisation of Hikmat or any other politicians; and the general’s assurances to Sir Maurice seemed to indicate that Hikmat (whose offence, accord ing to the Prime Minister, seemed to be no greater than that of having main tained contact with disaffected officers and other suspect individuals) would, in fact, be treated leniently. 4. It was therefore with some perturbation that the Ambassador learnt, on the 17th March, that the trials had been concluded, and that, of eight men found guilty, seven, including Hikmat, had been sentenced to death. Your Lordship had already authorised the Ambassador in such an event to inform General Nuri that Sir Maurice’s advice that he should show forbearance in the case of Hikmat was offered with your full knowledge and consent, and to add that the help which His Majesty’s Government were able and happy to give General Nuri personally in 1936 (when the general was afforded shelter in the Embassy immediately after Bakr Sidqi’s coup d’Etat) entitled your Lordship to say that he should show forbearance now. Sir Maurice accordinglv conveyed this message to General Nuri, who replied that he was advising King Ghazi to commute Hikmat’s sentence to one of five years’ imprisonment, and that even this reduced sentence might later be curtailed. [580 o—l] April 11, 183 2734 Sect ! 0N 1: -9dy4 2 5. The sentences, as originally passed and subsequently commuted, which show that Nuri was as good as his word, were as follows :— Hikmat Sulaiman. Hilmi Abdul Karim. Ismail Abbawi. Yunis Abbawi. Jawad Hussain. Abdul Hadi Kamil. Ali Ghalib. Original Sentence. Death. Death. Death. Death. Death. Seven years’ hard labour. Eight years’ hard labour and two years’ police sur veillance Commuted to — Five years’ imprisonment. Penal servitude for life. Penal servitude for life. Penal servitude for life.

In internal affairs, the undertaking to encourage marriage in order to secure a higher birth rate is a novelty, and it is significant that the idea of converting part of the pqlice force into a gendarmerie is revived. In finance, attention is promised to the establishment of equilibrium in trade with individual countries and a drive to increase exports of dates, grain and tobacco is foreshadowed. 3. As regards foreign policy, the reaffirmation of the Government’s desire to foster friendly relations with Great Britain is satisfactory, but it is clear that this desire is to be subordinated to continued vigorous endeavours to achieve closer political, economic and cultural unity between all The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc. &amp;u vV it British Embassy, Bagdad. 30th March, 1939.

The Prime Minister, H,E 0 Sayid Nuri as-Said, 'broadcast an important speech from the Baghdad 'broadcasting station at 8 p 0 mo last nighto The Premier outlined the policy of his Cabinet in the light of the Ministerial programme v'hich was published last Tuesday. His Excellency began by saying that v/hen he was entrusted by his Majesty the King with the task of forming a new Government he made a statement to the public on the events that had occurred during recent years, and suggestea the measures that should be taken to bring about an improvement in the situation. He went on to say that he had chosen as his Ministerial colleagues statesmen who were well known for their independence of thought. He was sure, therefore, that steps that might be contemplated by them would not arouse any difference of opinion. 'Now that the Cabinet’s programme of policy has been announced', said his Excellency, 'and as I believe in the necessity of personal contact with the people from time to time in order that they may be acquainted with the intentions of the Cabinet, I consider it advisable to speak to them again, giving them further enlightenment on the points raised in the programme. The nation as a whole is unanimous on the need of our reverting to normal conditions, and this can be effected only by increasing the authority of the Constitution. To ensure that this will be carried out it is of the utmost importance that the personnel of the defencedefence forces should not he allowed to contemplate any renewal of the unhappy events of the past e It is possible that some of those who were dismissed from the Army are men of good will and men who, in the past, may have rendered valuable service to the State,, It is not intended to lose the services of such men, and the State will no doubt be able to utilize them in other branches of the Administrationo The unfortunate events of the past seriously affected the machinery of State causing many public complaints as to the manner in which certain officials were carrying out their duties. This led the Cabinet to obtain legal powers to enable the Government to eliminate the causes of these complaints, and to ensure that State officials will carry out their duties in the best manner possible,' Sayid Nuri as-Said then turned to the financial situation of the country, saying: 'The unfortunate events of the past also seriously affected the financial position of the country,. The State has been unable to carry out any important development schemes since 1936, with the exception of the projects which were provided for in that year„ In 1936 the Treasury had a reserve of I.D. 700,000, To-day the State is indebted to the extent of about one million dinars, and the revenues from the oil royalties, which amount to about two million dinars annually, have been pledged as security. All who are aware of the former sound financial position of Iraq will agree that such a state of affairs is very hard on the country. Not only have we no reserve at present but there is an actual deficiency of about I 0 D 0 800,000, in addition to a further sum of I.D, 652,000 which we are bound to pay although no authority has ever beenobtained for the expenditure of this amouh't,These facts make it incumhent on us to take immediate steps to rectify the financial situation. Furthermore,, it is essential that a number of urgent productive schemes should be carried out without any delay in the Middle Euphrates and in other parts of the country. These schemes were mentioned in our programme of policy&gt; and I assure you that we are now doing our best to find the funds required to carry them out without imposing additional burdens on the tax-payers. M Lastly, HoE 0 Sayid Nuri as-Said turned to the foreign policy of Iraq, saying: 'Our foreign policy is based on the following two principles lo The policy of alliance with neighbouring independent Arab States and sincere friendship with ow? two neighbours, Turkey and Iran, in the spirit of the Saadabad Pact; 2 0 The policy of our alliance with Great Britain. These two principles will be followed on parallel paths. Our relations with other Arab countries, and our feeling that they should attain their freedom and independence, do not clash with these two principles. As regards our policy towards other foreign States, it is based on friendship and mutual interest, and it is therefore in the interests of Iraq that this country should not be made the centre of any activities, whatever their origin may be, which may prejudice the two principles to which I have referred.'T , i In any further communication on this subject, please 4 ’ N »- 1 - 2484 I [XY^JigggNHOENl L © anu address —not to any fkrson by name, but to—/ The U^xler-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his _ compliments to ~1V* U (vrf and, by direction of the Secretary of State, \i transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

Meanwhile following is my appreciation of Syrian situation as it affects Iraq. It is becoming clear here that public interest in the situation in Syria is likely soon to develop into serious agitation. Newspapers are publishing violent articles. In Nationalist circles feeling is strong and there is much talk of organizing active support for Syrian Arabs. Ties of public sympathy and personal contacts of leaders are much closer between Iraq and Syria than between Iraq and Palestine and I fear that if, as seems likely, serious disturbances break out in Syria, agitation which will be aroused here will be even stronger than that which has been excited by troubles in Palestine. Probable results will be : (a) Persistent pressure on His Majesty's Government to persuade French Government to ratify Franco-Syrian Treaty of 1936. (b) Surreptitious despatch of men and arms to Syria.(It?) ^ 3. Both developments would he embarrassing. A bitter campaign of propaganda will also be waged against France in^which Great Britain as France’s close associate and erstwhile ally will certainly become involved. 4. Apart therefore from wider considerations put forward by King G-hazi and his Ministers* continued deterioration of the situation in byria is likely to complicate our relations with IraqiGovernment.

R., 9-SO a„ra, 10th April, 1939. i\o. 3.32 mmxTAm, I feel that the time has come to invite your most serious attention to the situation regarding British interests in Iraq both as they are affected by internal politics and general world affairs. It is not a reassuring one* To give a true picture a certain ba leg round is necessary. On a purely nationalist people, to whom we have granted independence impinged the Palestine problem. For better or worse we admitted their interests in this problem, let our special position as adviser arid ally precluded our Palestinian policy being judged on its merit here Iraq has always felt aggrieved that a nation so closely associated wiih her has not definitely favoured the Arab case* This attitude may be illogical but it is a fact and we have to deal with it as such* This difference of opinion has for seme years still fully been exploited by anti-British elements first by Italy and then to much greater effect by Germany.-, And the task of those elements has been much lightened by the policy of France in Syria with which Iraq feels even closer sympathy than she does with the Arabs of Palestine* (It is true that Iraq re cognises that in recent months Great Britain has to some extent come round a. the Arab view of Palestine). Meanwhile Iraqi attention had been directed also to Koweit and King Ghazi , ‘ s propaganda was all the more difficult to deal I Nfwith ab he .’jade it fris own personal hobby and as the Monarch resio^ec e&lt;.»u..- u-^ial &lt;-oni.roi. Moreover here eoo Genian influences and the effect of the success achieved by German methods in 1 Antral Europe did all in their power to make mischief. Fina-tlj Syiua came on tno scene and the combination of agitation O' this subject with that, about Palestine and Xoweit worked Iraqi press and wireless into a symphony of extreme nationalist anti-British and anti-French complications. To press and wireless vere added street demonstrations passively and some times accively encouraged by official quarters and in which khaki clad school cadets were wont to take part, German Minister has also been inclined to exploit to his advantage Iraqi disappoint ment over the difficulties which they have experienced in obtain ing arms from His Majesty's Government. He has for example been able to contrast his own offer of credit of four million pounds with apparent unwillingness of His Majesty's Government to help. In suoi circumstances the effect of the King's death can well be imagined, T.t -ms easy for German and other interested circles to spreae rumours that this tragedy had been caused by the English 103 . v-„ 0 :a ms disappearance seemed to come at such a con venient moment. I have had many indications of this suggestion and of the reactions to it; suffice it to say that apart from the Mosul crime an attempt on the life of the legal adviser was, the Ministry oi. l*of©iQ'n jvP'Ppj j-»o /-v-p o-p+i j -^r ^ CJ .~ on o C0u ciubiior.c iy .1 riiorruS hi© narrowly frustrated some days ago (this may be admittedly be due to mis taken identity) and I myself have been provided with a personal detective. It is true that immediate tension of Royal funeral has passed and that the Mosul murder has impressed the Government most forcibly wita the necessity of taking more stringent measures to maintain public order. But none can never be sure what effect G-erman. *, 8 .German money and propaganda will have at any given moment on a people who like Iranians are credulous, highly impressionable and highly nationalist. Another disquieting feature of the situation is the lack of homogeneity in the Cabinet. The members of the present Govern ment so hurriedly brought together when their predecessors were driven from office last December have little in common and for this reason are not well adapted to deal firmly with the critical situation. The Prime Minister must therefore watch his step most carefully if he is not to trip over the forest of obstacles which [grp.undec:] nationalists or German propaganda have placed in the way of Anglo-Iraqian friendship and he knows it. He is clearly alarmed and now asks for our help both in enabling him to trace and counter pro-vGerman-and anti-British, machinations in._Iraq, and through an agreement with the Arabs about Palestine to prevent his own position being undermined by the extreme nationalists (it has been put about that even he had a hand in the King’s death). Your telegram No. 274 to Cairo seems to show that a solution acceptable to the Arabs in general is not impossible: but so far as Iraq is concerned it is important that this should be brought about quickly. Situation in this country would look grave were European war to break out with Palestine still unsolved in a manner acceptable to the Arabs. At the best we could expect but half-hearted co-operation from Iraq; at the worst (and it is by no means to be discounted) we might be faced v/ith popular opposition to the declared deterraination of the present Iraqi Government to implement alliance. Prime Minister is I know full of genuine admiration for the patience and resource with which the Secretary of State for the Colonies....;'4, 220) 2-*^ v Colonies has conducted these difficult and prolonged negotiations. It would I feel be a thousand pities if the present negotiations if^re to be so protracted that the effect of the ultimate solution would be lost owing to the atmosphere having in the meanwhile been vitiated by the forces described above. I am doing my best to strengthen the Prime Minister’s hand and on April 8th I told him that in my opinion [grp.undec;] Arab opposition to the policy of His Majesty’s Government ^ould, if it continued, make all settlement impossible 6 I recalled that in Iraq both treaty of 1922 and that of 1930 were declared to be unaccept able and were the subject of hostile demonstrations of most savage kind. Yet they had been worked out well and served as a model envied by other countries. The moral was obvious and the Prime Minister was quick to take it reminding the Oriental Secretary who was present of how fighting ceased here as soon as a provisional government was installed. I vail when I communicate to him today or on April 11th substance of your telegram No. 274 to Cairo urge him, in the light of Iraq’s own experience, to take the lead in support ing His Majesty’s Government’s policy. I apologise for inflicting on you this long telegram at a moment of grave preoccupation but it is my duty to make plain not only the delicacy of the position here but the importance of an early agreed Palestine solution as a means of stabilising at vital point of our Imperial communications a situation which is far from secure. French Minister is similarly anxious and is impressing on his Government the urgency of giving satisfaction in Syria.

I am satisfied, however, that the Iraqi Government did not come to their conclusion regarding appointment of Abdul Illah without most careful consideration. Apart from constitutional provision that the Regent shall be Z'? selected by former ruler J and indication that this was done in the present case (my telegram No. 108) Prime Minister has assured me that although he had excellent qualities Amir Seid would have been most unsuitable on account of his wife who completely controls him. She is, he said, ambitious, venal, susceptible to German influence and in touch with all sorts of undesirable circles in the Middle East. If Zeid were Regent it would, according to the Prime Minister, have unfavourable effect in oth^r Arab countries. Asmmmh As regards Iraq, it would be optimistic to hope that German influence (already at work in his household although Zeid is admittedly aware of them) would not obtain a stronghold at Court and an ascendency over the King if indeed latter did not suffer a worse illness. Moreover General Nuri’s predecessor Jamil Nadfai pressed Zeid’s candidature up to the last and as General Nuri was already committed (my telegram No. 114) to sponsor Abdul Illah (who he believes will develop into a good Regent) he could not be expected*to accept Jamil Nadfai’s view. In fact he warned Jamil Nadfai that if he was determined to support Seid he had better stay away from Parliament today and I understand that ultimately Jamil Nadfai voted for Abdul Illah whose appointment was unanimously confirmed. -i. ■Obi any further communication on_this subject, please quote No. ^ and address— no/ to any terson ion on this subject, please quote ^ 'rson by name, bin to— *■ 1 0 l / / ' 9 '• “/ &gt; , “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. r.

The resolution and the debate which followed its introduction aroused much public interest. A summary of some of the principal speeches is contained in the enclosed cutting from the Iraq Times .It will be seen that Daud-al-Saadi received no support for his resolution and that many of the speakers maintained that the action which had been taken by Jamil-al-Madfai’s Cabinet under the Harmful Propaganda Law had been fully justified. 3. Before the debate took place the present Cabinet had decided that, as they were not directly concerned, they would not themselves take part and that the fate of the resolution should be left to the free vote of the Chamber. During the debate several speakers (whose speeches are not fully reported by the Iraq Times) passed from a defence of Jamil Madfai’s use of the Harmful Propaganda Law against those who had encouraged bomb-throwing in public places to praise of his past services to the country and, when the voting took place, the result had the character, not so much of a defeat of Daud-al-Saadi’s resolution, as of a unanimous declaration of the Chamber’s approval of the work of Jamil Madfai and his colleagues. The present Cabinet had not foreseen such a development and have been made to feel very uneasy by this demonstration of the Chamber’s loyalty to the late Government. 4.

I was summoned this afternoon to the Palace where the Cabinet was meeting under the Presidency of King Ghazi. On my arrival the Cabinet suspended the sitting and I was received by King Ghazi who was attended by the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance. It was explained that the Cabinet had in the course of review of the woild situation and the possibility of war and had reached the conclusion that three points involving British and Iraoi interests required attention. 1. Syria. His Majesty asked me to convey to the King an expression of his earnest hope that the opportunity of the French State visit would be taken to urge on the announcement at this stage in the present international situation of the ratification of the treaty with Syria of 1936. Deplorable effects of the present French policy were emphasised and it was pointed out that if war broke out Iraqi Government would find themselves in an unenviable position of supporting the British Empire v/hose French allies would very likely be engaged in repressive measures against the Arabs of Syria. 2, Palestine. Prime Minister explained that the Arabs had accepted all the proposals except that for undefined transitional period. Before he left London he had seen drafts fixing the period atat five years (the Arabs he said had suggested three years but five years would be better than no limit) and had not since heard what arguments had induced His Majesty’s Government to change their mind. King G-hazi interjected that the Prime Minister had shown him that draft. The Arabs were most anxious to co-operate but goodwill must come from both parties not the Arabs alone. I made use of the arguments in paragraph 3 in your telegram No* 198 to Cairo but King Ghazi and his Ministers were not convinced and the Prime Minister maintained that it was unjust to penalise a majority in order to placate a small minority. His Majesty’s Government would know [Grp, undec] the opposition to the passage and could surely devise means of dealing with it. King Ghazi and Prime Minister indicated that failure to settle the Palestine problem would inevitably affect the degree of popular support for the fulfilment of alliance obligations by the Iraqi Government (who had no intention of avoiding obligations) and urged that His Majesty’s Government should consider this one point and so secure whole hearted Arab goodwill. 3. Koweit. The hope was expressed that the Sheik would be encouraged to respond to projected friendly overtures (see Sir M. Peterson's telegram No. 66). I received this stiffly and energetically protested against the incidents on March 9th, March 15th and March 20th reported to India Office by Resident at Bushire. Report follows by telegram later.

Peterson to Viscount ialifax.—(Received February 28.) (No. 70.) My Lord, Bagdad, February 14, 1939. I HAVE the honour to report that the Iraqi Parliament reassembled on the 0th February, after the adjournment, which began on the 1st December last. 2. The Government have several important laws under preparation which, it is expected, will soon be submitted to the Chamber. Among these are :— (1) A law to amend the Organic Law of March 1925. (2) A law to amend the Electoral Law of October 1924. (3) A law to amend the Liwa Administration Law of April 1927. (4) A law concerning the efficiency of administrative officials (mutessarifs, kaimakams and mudirs). (5) A law providing for the division into two ministries of the present Ministry of Economics and Communications. 3. Numbers (1), (2), (3) and (5) are being prepared in the light of the recommendations made by a special committee set up by Jamil Madfai’s Government last December. The president of the committee was Naji Pasha Suwaidi and the members Mr. Drower, the adviser to the Ministry of Justice, Mr. Edmonds, the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, and Abdul Aziz Qassah, the Comptroller and Auditor-General. 4. The main purpose of the proposed amendments to the Organic Law and the Electoral Law was outlined in the public speech made by Nuri Pasha on the 4th January, the text of which was given in the enclosure to my despatch No. 3 of the 7th January, and some details of the recommendations made by the Naji Suwaidi Committee have now reached me. 5. It does not appear that any far-reaching change in the principles of the Constitution have been suggested or will be attempted. The amendments recommended deal rather with points of detail and aim at eliminating the defects which experience has revealed in the original law. There is, however, I under stand, a recommendation concerning the dissolution of Parliament which, if adopted, may have important results. Paragraph 2 of article 26 of the Organic Law provides that the King dissolves Parliament. The committee has advised that this should be amended in such a way as to make a dissolution dependent on a resolution passed by three-fifths of the Senate. At the same time, it is recommended that article 31 should be amended to define more precisely the past services to the State which are a necessary qualification for nomination to membership of the Senate. 6. The effect of the first of these two amendments would be to curtail very considerably the power of Cabinets to bring about a dissolution of Parliament at will and it would thereby strengthen the control of Parliament over the Cabinet. The second amendment is clearly intended to increase the fitness of the Senate to discharge the new function with which it will be entrusted by the first. 7. Other amendments to the Organic Law which, I understand, have been recommended by the Naji Suwaidi Committee are :— That the last sentence of article 18 concerning foreigners who must be employed in accordance with treaties and agreements shall be deleted as no longer necessary; that Senators and Deputies shall be paid a monthly salary throughout the year, and not a fixed salary for each session; that ordinary sessions shall begin on the 1st January, instead of the 1st November; that the High Court provided for in articles 81 and 82 shall be appointed each year, and not ad hoc by Royal Irade; that articles 114, 115, 116 and 117 shall be deleted from the Organic Law; and that arrangements should be made in some other legal manner to give effect to their provisions. [530 ee—1]■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 2 8. I have not yet received much information concerning the committee s report on the amendment of the Electoral Law, but I understand that one of its most interesting features is a recommendation that all candidates for election to the Chamber should obtain a public nomination and make a cash deposit, w *^ch would be forfeited by those who fail to obtain a specified number of votes. I he idea is to modify the existing practice whereby all candidates are secret Govern ment nominees by compelling all who seek election openly to present themselves to their constituencies. The committee have also recommended that the constituencies should be redistributed and that trades and crafts should have direct representation equal to one-fifth of the total number of Deputies. 9. The third task of the Naji Suwaidi Committee was to make proposals for the improvement of the provincial administration, by amending the existing Liwa Administration Law. This law (in article 23) lays on the mutessarif of each liwa a wide diversity of administrative responsibilities without, at the same time, providing him with powers to enable him to discharge these obligations. For example, he is required to spread education, without having control of any funds for this purpose; to protect public health, without exercising authority over the medical institution set up in his liwa, and so on. The amendments proposed by the committee aim at giving powers to mutessarifs to direct the spending of certain grants made for public service in the State budget and provide that they shall be assisted in this work by an elected council. This council will be separate from the existing Majlis Idara, or Administrative Council, whose functions are restricted. It is hoped by these means to stimulate local interest in public welfare and progress and to check the dangerous tendency which has been noticeable in recent years to devote to Bagdad too great a proportion of the budgets of the public services. 10. The proposal to make two Ministries of the Ministry of Economics and Communications was, as your Lordship is aware, already under consideration by Jamil Madfai’s Government before their resignation on the 25th December. The division of the departments concerned has not yet been finally settled and I understand that the views of Mr. Loggin (the new adviser) are being carefully considered. 11. The fourth of the laws listed in paragraph 2 above was devised originally about six years ago by Naji Shaukat, then Minister of the Interior, and has now been recovered from the archives of the ministry. Naji Shaukat’s plan is that all mutessarifs and kaimakams and mudirs should be obliged to undergo an examination and that those who fail to obtain the necessary number of marks should be dismissed. Marks in the examination would be given partly for personality and record, and partly for answers to questions set in papers on geography, history and general knowledge. To pass, it would be necessary to obtain a fixed minimum in each subject. It may well come to pass, therefore, that an excellent official may be dismissed because he is unable to give a list of the principal rivers of China, or to explain the origins of the Reformation. The whole idea is typical of Naji Shaukat’s rigid and doctrinaire approach to administrative problems; nor does it appear that Naji Shaukat has any idea how he will obtain better men to replace those who fail to pass his egregious examination. 12. In the meanwhile, a general post of senior officials has left Sulaimani, Mosul and Kirkuk without a mutessarif, and the rumour that a superannuated staff officer whom the army have long wished to be rid of is to be made mutessarif of Sulaimani does not suggest that the Government have any good men in mind to fill these vacancies. 13. The administration and public order of the Sulaimani liwa at present both leave much to be desired, and it is unfortunate that no mutessarif of character and experience can be found to be sent there. 14.

I told General Nuri this morning that I was greatly disappointed and concerned at the arrest of Hikmat (who is actually in prison). Such a step was bound to [grp. undec.] gravest doubt on impartiality and good faith of General Null's own administration. It was only admissible on the strongest [? grp. omtd.] and so far as he had been able to find out there was no evidenceo General Nuri admitted that evidence against Hikmat was at present confined to [? grp, undec.] that a nephew of his was known to associate with one of two officers who had approached Emir V^oO Abdul. XU la (my telegram No. 50). He assured me that he intended to be impartial and that the Court before which Hikmat would appear would contain two civilian judges as well as military officers. He had every intention of dealing with the matter speedily as well as impartially and there was no question of Hikmat being treated on the same footing as other persons arrested who were criminals. I said I v/as convinced of GenemL Nuri’s own impartiality but not so of other members of his Government. I knew that His Majesty's Government would regard matter with serious concern and I hoped I might speedily have news of Hikmat's release. General Nurim~r f (vg, r\ L 1 495 1 ^Nuri had indicated that the Court referred to above was to be maintained for some time and I could only say that in that case it seemed to me to be assuming the character of a revolutionary tribunal. I hoped that no further arrests of politicians were contemplated. General Nuri said he thought not. Arrests now number about 8 ? of whom 3 or 4 are civilians. With the exception of Hikmat other arrests are Bekr Sidki’s gangsters and have to their discredit inter alia complicity in Assyrian massacre of 1933, the murder of Bekr Sidki’s mistress in order to pave the way for his marriage with an Austrian, and , u ■■■■ the attempt on the life of MaulphrJ Mukhlis in 1937. General Nuri maintains that the offence for which they are to be tried is that referred to in my telegram 50 namely an army conspiracy to replace the King by the Emir Abdul Illah (the latter confirmed to me yesterday that his part had been as stated by General Nuri). But it was clear from General Nuri's conversation and his frequent reference to '’murderers 0 that his mind was in the past and I -thought it well (at the risk of annoying him, which I did) to enquire whether the offences were in the future or in the past, and whether he was not departing from the wise impartiality of Jamil Madfai f s Government. I left him in no doubt that I intended to watch further proceedings very carefully. I am hopeful that there is no real danger to Hikmat and on present information I do not think we need concern ourselves very much about the others who have so far been arrested.FILE COPY \ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 16 o f the 16th January, I have the honour to state that the situation with regard to the Palace seems to me to have been modified by the action of the Government in appointing Rashid Ali-al-Gilani to be Rais of the Diwan and private secretary to His Majesty. 2. Rashid-al-Khoja, the previous occupant of the post, has been appointed Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a position for which he is quite unsuited but which, I am informed, he may occupy only temporarily. As I reported in my despatch No. 288 of the 28th June last, I have always regarded Rashid-al-Khoja as the least harmful element in the Palace entourage : but it is undoubtedly a matter for satisfaction that the new appointment should have caused Doctor Damluji, the Chamberlain, who is an old enemy of Rashid Ali's to accept protracted leave of absence from his duties, to which he is not expected to return. 3. Rashid Ali's career is summed up in the Personalities Report. He has been Prime Minister and was Minister of the Interior, and therefore a colleague of Nuri Pasha, in Yasin’s Government which was upset by the Bakr SidqP coup of 1936. Your Lordship will recollect that it was the action of Jamil-al-Madfai's Government in banishing Rashid Ali from the capital which led to the military movement of Christmas Eve last. He passes for being unscrupulous without being actually corrupt, an arch-intriguer and in politics a “wild man.” Taufiq-as- Suwaidi, who could not perhaps be expected to record a favourable verdict, told me recently that he regarded Rashid Ali “as a desequilibre.'’' From the same source I learn that when Rashid Ali's banishment was ordered King Ghazi sent for Taufiq-as-Suwaidi and enquired: “Why have you sent him to Anah ? It is far too good a place for him.'' It might therefore be supposed that the new appointment was unwelcome to His Majesty and I had some hopes of ascertaining his point of view when I went to see him this morning. However, with the per versity which characterises him and which makes His Majesty so difficult a man to help, the King brought Rashid Ali in with him to present to me and insisted on his remaining throughout our conversation. 4. Welcome as is the disappearance of Doctor Damluji my own feeling is that Pasha has committed a grave blunder in introducing into the Palace a man who, judging by his previous record, can be relied upon to pursue the customary oriental tactics and to secure control of His Majesty in the controller's own interests. My second conclusion is that in placing, as he has done and without consulting me in any way, an ex-Prime Minister in the Palace entourage, Nuri Said has relieved me of any responsibility which I might otherwise have been disposed to undertake in the matter of persuading the King to accept the Emir Zeid, or anyone else, as Palace Counsellor. Rashid Ali is an undoubted person ality, although a not very reassuring one; and there can hardly be room in the Palace for another. 5 I must add that, according to Taufiq-as-Suwaidi, it was only after he had tried unsuccessfully to induce his colleagues of Justice, Finance and Interior successively to resign in Rashid Ali's favour that Nuri decided to appoint the latter to his present post. The ex-Foreign Minister adds that Nuri’s insistence on creating a post for Rashid Ali is due, not only to the Prime Minister’s well- known inability to resist helping anyone who has formerly been his friend, but to the ominous demands of a certain clique in the armv which describes itself as “Rashid Ali's Camp (Washash).” 6. I take this opportunity to correct an error in paragraph 12 of my despatch under reference, in which I stated that the Emir Zeid had no children. He has a son of about 2 years old. 7.

(E 1023/474/93) c ')' FOREIGN OPPICE, S.W. 1. «O/ g 24th February, 1939. '53 £ir, The Prime Minister of Iraq called on 21st February to see me before leaving London to return to Bagdad. 2. After some general observations regarding the Palestine Conference and the evils of political Zionism, General Nuri al Said turned to the position in Syria. He had been asked some weeks ago to convey a message from the Turkish President to the Syrian Government, but he had not hitherto passed on this message: It was to the effect that the Syrian Government should accept the present position as regards the Hatay and cease from making anti-Turkish propaganda in this connexion; the Turkish Government further desired to make it clear that, apart from the Hatay, Turkey had no wish to change her existing frontier with Syria; the message proceeded to affirm that Turkey entertained friendly feelings towards the Syrian Government, and sympathised with them in their present difficulties. It appeared that General Nuri did not now intend to take any action with regard to this Turkish message, since the Syrian Government had resigned in the course of the last few days. The General declared, however, that he was very anxious regarding the position in Syria and thought that the refusal of the French Government to ratify the Franco-Syrian Treaty of His Excellency Sir Maurice Peterson, K.C.M.G., etc. , etc. , Bagdad. etc. ,H© believed of 1936 would have very serious consequences, that the anti-French feeling in Syria was incited by foreign powers, and he wondered whether, if complete confusion were to prevail in Syria as a result of trouble between the Syrians and the French, the Turks might not see.^: to take advantage of the situation. The French were, in his opinion, pursuing a very dangerous policy in Syria and it was partly due to the French that the Damascus Government had so little influence in various outlying districts, such as the Jezireh. 3. I suggested to His Excellency that the Syrian Government would do well in their own interests to keep on the best possible terms with both the French and the Turks, and I understood him to express his general agreement with this view. 4. I then referred to the Iraqi Government’s recent request for credit facilities and said that I understood that he had in the course of the last few days had a full discussion with Mr. Nixon, the General Manager of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, and that as a result he was arranging for Mr. Hogg, the British financial adviser to the Iraqi Government, to pay a flying visit to London to engage in further financial discussions. General Nuri confirmed this and stated that he had also discussed the situation with a representative of Messrs. Baring. ihe position briefly was that there were three courses which might be open to the Iraqi Government in this matter; if» as they hoped, they could obtain financial credits fromHis Majesty’s Government, the resulting contracts would of course he placed with British firms; failing such credits they might decide on a loan, in which case the contracts would he placed with whatever firm offered to supply their requirements on the most advantageous terms, and the orders might well go to other than British manufacturers; lastly the Iraqi Government might decide simply to cancel their public works programme, in which case also the contracts would he lost to British industry. 5. General Nuri then said that he had received telegrams from Bagdad, including one from King Ghazi, referring to a dispute which had arisen in Xoweit between the Sheikh of Koweit and his Council, and expressing the hope that the Sheikh would not take drastic action against that body. 6. In conclusion General Nuri asked for my views on his Government's idea of negotiating a Treaty of Alliance with Egypt. I informed him that there would he no objection whatever, so far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, to his undertaking such negotiations, hut I would ask to he kept informed of their progress, and to he given an opportunity to study the draft text of any new treaty, if the negotiations reached that stage, in order to have an opportunity of offering comments. General Nuri agreed to this, and explained that his intention was to suggest that the new treaty should he on rather different lines from the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, for he thought it should provide that each country should send troops to the other to assistassist in case of needo The Iraqi Government would be prepared in certain circumstances to send troops to help Egypt if attacked. He hoped that an undertaking from Egypt similarly to assist Iraq would have a steadying and very beneficial effect upon Iraq’s relations with Persia.

CAXTER.wwwmmwmmm THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 756/72/93] 1002 ! I959 J January 30, 1939. Section 1. Copy No. 77 Sir M. Peterson to Viscount Halifax.—{Received January 30.) (No. 16.) My Lord, * Baydad, January 16, 1939. WITH reference to my despatch No. 631^ of the 27th December last, I have the honour to report that recent conversationsT which I have had with Nuri baid, have given me some further insight into the political ideas which are uppermost in his mind—a mind which is undoubtedly quick, while I am not yet convinced of its stability of purpose. 2. Nuri has explained that all public men in Iraq are concerned about the manner in which, during the past four years, Governments have been overthrown one after the other by secretly contrived unconstitutional action, and that he is determined to make an effort to put an end to this state of affairs, even though conscious that he himself owes to it his accession to office. 3. His appreciation of the elements of the situation is not new, and I need only summarise it in the briefest terms. While King Faisal was alive he kept his finger on the pulse of public opinion and changed Cabinets as soon as their popularity had waned or their unpopularity had reached a dangerous point. 4. Since his death there has been no constitutional instrument responsive to public feeling and capable of acting in this manner. King Ghazi, through his youth, inexperience, and hitherto unstable temperament has been unable to employ his father’s methods, and Parliament, packed as it has always been with the nominees of each successive Cabinet, has in no way reflected the changes of public feeling. In consequence. Governments, once established, have endeavoured to remain in office regardless of public feeling and have sought to repress, instead of to satisfy, criticism and opposition. In so doing they have often indulged in abuses of their special powers such as those derived from the Malicious Propaganda Law. Public resentment has thereupon rapidly increased and has found ^expression in the disturbing tribal or military demonstrations against the Government of the day which have become an almost annual event in recent years. 5. The remedy, Nuri Said concludes, is to restore to the Constitution, in working order, this necessary instrument which, reacting to public opinion, will dismiss Cabinets when they have outlived their utility. In his speech to the Muthannah Club, a copv of which I communicated to your Lordship with my despatch No. 3 of the 7th January, the Prime Minister indicated his wish so to reform the Electoral Law that the Chamber would become the natural instrument for changes of Government, and a committee, actually set up by Jamil Madfai’s Cabinet, is at present drafting proposals with this end in view. 6. Nuri has, however, made it clear to me that he has little hope that constitutional or electoral reforms can give the desired results. He feels that the people are politically too backward to be able to work a free Constitution effectively, and that, whereas a quick remedy is evidently needed, the education of the country in the art of democratic government will take many years. His personal inclination, therefore, is to seek somehow to restore to the Palace the influence which it enjoyed when King Faisal was on the throne. This expose of his views supplies, I think, the answer to the question contained in the first paragraph of your telegram No. 14 of the 13th January, which reached me after this despatch had been drafted. 7. The. hope that King Ghazi himself, as he grew into maturity, would be able to take his father’s place must now. Nuri feels, be deferred even if not finally set aside and he is evidently searching for a plan whereby the Emir Zeid [505 gg—1] j /can be used to replace the King, in fact if not in name. It is by this process of thought that he has come to evolve the idea of making Zeid a kind of Royal Counsellor in the Palace. Or, alternatively, of making him Prime Minister in a Government pledged to eliminate the army from politics and to restore constitutional checks and balances (please see my telegrams No. 9 of the and No. 5, Saving, of the 11th January, 1939). 8. Both plans offer considerable difficulties, and this probably explains Nuri’s vacillation between the two. In my last talk with him he seemed disposed to abandon altogether the idea of making Zeid Prime Minister and to be concentrating instead on devising means to introduce the Emir into the Palace. He is clearly puzzled, however, to know how to overcome King Ghazi’s suspicions, and as I reported in my telegram No. 5, Saving, of the 11th January, he has asked me to help him to explain the position to His Majesty. 9. For the reasons given in my despatch No. 631 of the 27th December last there are grounds for believing that Nuri’s plans for the better government of the kingdom may not be altogether free from personal hostility to King Ghazi. and that was why I asked him to tell me frankly whether or not he was aiming at placing the Emir Zeid on the throne instead of King Ghazi. He assured me that this was not so, and that his sole purpose was to find a remedy for the deplorable political situation which he had already discussed with me. 10. As I see it the defects which the constitutional machinery of the country have revealed since the death of King Faisal are very real, and though, having regard to the manner in which he himself has come into office, it may be hypo critical of Nuri to shed tears over the wickedness of military plots to overthrow Cabinets, it is I think clearly his duty as Prime Minister to try to prevent a repetition of such plots and in our interests to help him to do so. I also see force in his argument that much time is likely to be required to develop in Parliament the power effectively to direct the government of the country. As your Lordship knows, several plans for strengthening the influence of the Palace by means of a Privy Council have been discussed by Nuri’s predecessors, but to form such a council would be to give power to a number of men without responsibility and to diminish the authority of the responsible Ministers to a degree which might make it impossible for them to govern. 11. Nuri’s plan has the merit of offering the possibility of a speedy remedy for the country’s constitutional ills without the defects inherent in the creation of a Privy Council. At the same time there is the evident risk that his assurances that he is not aiming at getting rid of King Ghazi may not be altogether honest, and if this plan is adopted it will be necessary to be constantly on the watch for any attempt to allow the appointment of the Emir Zeid to the Palace as a counsellor to King Ghazi to develop into a movement to place him on his nephew’s throne. 12. I he stability of Iraq would. I am convinced, be impaired by any change of this nature which would enable all discontented elements to rally round a legitimist cause. Since Zeid has no children, the succession would also be brought into question. 13. In the meanwhile Nuri has wisely decided to break with the practice of his predecessors and not to dissolve Parliament, which is due to reassemble on the 1st February. On this point also he has changed his mind since I spoke to him on the 27th December (please see my telegram No. 218 of that date). 14. Outside the constitutional problem with which they are endeavouring to deal the new Government’s chief preoccupation is finance, and in my telegrams No. 3, Saving, of the 7th January, No. 12 of the 11th January and No. 'iS of the 14th January, I have reported to your Lordship the form of the problem with which they are confronted and the appeal which they are making to His Majesty’s Government for help to deal with it. 15. Publication of the Government’s general administrative programme has been delayed to enable consultation to take place with Naji Shaukat, the Minister of the Interior, who arrived from Angora on the 10th January. There has been some shuffling of officials, and it is expected that more will occur when Naji Shaukat has had time to take control of his department. The Prime Minister is doing his best to win popularity among the Euphrates sheikhs and has sent his son Saba as a peacemaker to Hikmat Sulaiman. The visit was returned when Saba was in hospital after an accident, and I am told that Nuri and Hikmat have since then themselves met.1002 2&lt;o 16. Nuri tells me that Naji Shaukat reports that the change of Xioveiv. has made an excellent impression in Angora, and that he has receivedHLFe mosT cordial messages fi-om the President Ismet Indnti. He proposes to return from the London Conference on Palestine via Angora where he will have some Jfccussions with the Turkish Government. 17.

Needs of Modern Democracy Political Parties and an Effective Opposition. The Amanah Hall was packed last night by a distinguished gathering on the occasion of the first public speech delivered by H.E. Sayid Nuri as-Said since he assumed the premiership. The speech was broadcast, and was hearu in all parts of Iraq. His Excellency received an enthusiastic reception when he rose to address the gathering. Taking as the subject of his speech ’'The Problems of Iraq and How They Should Be Solved,' his Excellency took his audience back to 1920, when, he said, a new democratic, constitutional State was set up in this country unuer his late Majesty King Faisal. EARLY OBSTACLES He continued: 'All our energies at that time were directed towards a gradual taking over of responsibilities from the British authorities in order to attain our complete independence. 'We had in mind, also, a desire to secure the most suitable laws for the country's needs, but the partnership of the British authorities in the Administration was/was an obstacle in the fulfilment of this desire. For example, the most important of such laws were the Iraq Constitution, the election laws, and the administrative laws. All these laws were influenced by the spirit of the mixed Administration. The Iraqi Constitution of 1922, for instance, was drafted outside Iraq. Though it was amended, nevertheless many gaps remain; and the same applies to the other laws, which are in the main out of date. DEMOCRATIC NEEDS. H We all hoped that by our joining the League of Nations the whole position would undergo a radical change and that we could then set up a really stable, progressive, and democratic State. H His Excellency then gave an outline of some of the differences between democratic and totalitarian States, saying that no true democratic State could be worthy of the name unless it permitted the establishment of political parties a parliamentary Opposition, freedom of the press, all of which were prohibited under the so-called dictatorships. 'These gaps,' his Excellency said, 'are the real causes of the disadvantages under which we labour to-day, and it is the duty of us all to co-operate and work together to fill these gaps if we intend to have a constitutional and democratic country. FOUR AIMS. 'In my opinion, therefore, we should work together to ensure the attainment of the following objectives:- '1. The establishment of political parties with sound national principles. '2. The acceptance of the principle of the existence of an Opposition and the necessity of ensuring co-operation between the Oprjosition and the Government in general policy. '3. The fostering of an intelligent, enlightened press, with/HUwith the freedom necessary to enable it to perform a valuable service for the country’s welfare. ,, 4. The strengthening of the parliamentary system by reforming the election laws in order to ensure the election of parliaments truly representative of the people and able effectively to control the activities of the Administration • His Excellency then said that he was not at present in a position to publish his Cabinet’s programme of policy as he was still awaiting the arrival of the newly appointed Minister of Interior, H.E. Sayid Naji Showkat. He hoped, however, that his new programme would outline reforms which would fill the present gaps and ameliorate the position. In conclusion his speech His Excellency read the fatiha for the souls of all who had lost their lives in the service of their country, whether soldiers, politicians, or official.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). January 4. 1939. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 72/72/93] Copy No. Sir M. Peterson to Viscount Halifax.—(Received January 4. 1939.) (No. 631.) My Lord, Bagdad, December 27. 1938. WITH reference to my telegram No^ljLiif. the 25th December, I have the honour to submit the following report on the events, so far as I have been able to ascertain them, which led to the resignation of Jamil Madfai’s Cabinet:— 2. About 7 o’clock on the evening of the 24th December a strong detachment of armoured cars and cavalry was moved from the military cantonment on the right bank of the Tigris at Washash and concentrated at Hinaidi, where it came under the direct control of the Chief of the General Staff. Shortly afterwards small parties of these troops were sent to the houses of Nuri Said and Taha-al-Hashimi to protect them, and at the same time a deputation of officers, headed by the Chief of the General Staff, sought and obtained an audience with King Ghazi, to whom they represented the dissatisfaction of the army with Jamil Madfai’s Administration. They begged His Majesty to call upon the Cabinet to resign and to replace it by another, which should include men who had faithfully served his father, such as Nuri Said and Taha-al-Hashimi. King Ghazi thereupon sent for the Prime Minister and his principal colleagues. I do not know precisely what passed between the Prime Minister and the King, but, according to the story told to me by the late Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom I paid a farewell visit on the 26t'h December, His Majesty gave his Government no support and was, indeed, in no condition even to discuss the situation. Taken as they were completely by surprise, the Government were left with no alternative but to resign. 3. It is said in many quarters that, after obtaining the resignation of Jamil Madfai, King Ghazi at first summoned Hikma t Su laiman, and that it was only after Hikmat had declared his inability to form a Government that the premier ship was offered to Nuri. The latter at once set about gathering his colleagues, and a Royal irada appointing the following Cabinet was read out with the customary ceremony in the Serai at 2 o’clock the following afternoon (the 25th December) :— Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs: Nuri Said (“ Personalities,” 66). Finance : Rustam Haidar (“ Personalities,” 72). Defence and Acting Minister of the Interior : Taha-al-Hashimi ( £t Personalities,” 81). Justice : Mahmud Subhi-al-Daftari (‘ £ Personalities,” 46). Education : Salih Jabr (“ Personalities,” 78). Economics and Communications : Umar Nazmi. At the same time a unanimous invitation from the entire Cabinet was despatched to Naji Shawkat ( k ‘ Personalities,” 62), the Iraqi Minister at Angora, to join them as Minister for the Interior. To-day I learn that he has accepted this invitation and is hastening to Bagdad. 4. With the exception of Umar Nazmi, all the colleagues chosen by Nuri Said are well known in public life. Umar Nazmi is a senior official who has an excellent reputation and whom the late Prime Minister several times endeavoured, without success, to persuade to accept the portfolio of the Interior. 5. Judging from their past record, the new ministers appear as competent and reasonable as can be expected in this country, but I confess to misgivings concerning Taha-al-Hashimi. He has for some time taken a leading part in the work of the Palestine Defence League, about whose objectionable activities I have had on several occasions to make strong representations to the Iraqi Govern ment. It is to be feared, therefore, that he may endeavour to influence the new' [505 d—1]§ 2 Government to adopt towards the Palestinian question an attitude less con- ^ ciliatory than that of their predecessors. As reported in my telegram No._218_ of to-day’s date. I have already given Nuri a strong hint on this subject. 6. As regards the Prime Minister himself, I have already reported in paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 563 of the 16th November that, according to the ^ f J impression I have formed, he is no Tonger the man he was. It is possible that the lack of balance and instability of temperament which he has shown since his last term of office are largely attributable to chagrin at his humiliation at the time of the couf d'i'Aat of October 1936. and that a return to power will bring out again some of the valuable qualities which he has shown in the past. I hope that this may be so. but his readiness to participate in yet another military couf (although this time a bloodless one) to overthrow a well-intentioned and successful Administration which had given him no personal or public justification for such a course does not inspire confidence. As your Lordship will be aware from my despatch No. 563, and as Nuri himself reminded me to-day, he gave me warning of the intended couf, and I, on my part, while frankly disbelieving its imminence, took such action as lay within my power to dissuade him from the course which he has now adopted. 7. The immediate reasons for this military revolt are seemingly trivial, but its root causes lie deep in the graver events of recent history. Superficially, it was the result of the irritation caused to the General Staff by the tactless and over-forceful behaviour of the recently-appointed Minister of Defence, Sabih Najib, whose service in the army as a junior officer was too recent for such behaviour to be acceptable. Fundamentally, it was the breaking into flame of the smouldering resentment of the officers who had been displaced and humiliated by j those who had won preferment and influence as the friends of Bakr Sidqi. Of these, Taha-al-Hashimi, the Chief of the General Staff, whom Bakr deposed and whose brother Yasin he drove from office, was the natural leader, and it is to him that the chief part in the movement must be attributed. Nuri’s share was probably much the same as Hikmat Sulaiman’s in the military revolt led by Bakr Sidqi, but it is doubtful whether any of the other members of the new Cabinet were in the plot. They were gathered together later just as Hikmat Sulaiman gathered his colleagues after Yasin-al-Hasnimi’s Cabinet had been driven out by the army in October 1936. 8. ' It is as yet too soon to determine what general policy the new Government may be expected to adopt. From the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, their attitude towards the question of Palestine is perhaps the most important consideration, and I have telegraphed to your Lordship separately (my telegram No. 217 of the 27th December) reporting the conversation which I have to-day had with Nuri Said on this subject. I may add that Nuri told me he was not worrying about world affairs, serious as they were, since 1 ‘ our course is already set by the side of Great Britain.’’ 9. As regards internal affairs, Nuri has, I am credibly informed, declared his determination to eschew all idea of avenging either the murder of Jafar Pasha A1 Askari or his own expulsion in October 1936, and he has already written to Hikmat Sulaiman assuring him that he has nothing to fear. He may, indeed, endeavour to hold to this principle, but he has also to reward those who regard themselves as having been his friends in need, and he will find it difficult to do this without displacing many who owe their present positions to his enemies. Already a number of army officers have been transferred from their commands and others have been given leave while their future is considered. 10. In matters of internal administration, the line taken by the new ministers is not likely to differ widely from the general policy of their pre decessors. There is, however, one important matter concerning which the policy of the Prime Minister will need particularly to be watched : I refer to the position of King Ghazi. 11. Although Nuri Said in our talk to-day employed conventional phrases about the King’s youth and inexperience, it is doubtful whether he has ever forgiven him for what he regards as His Majesty’s base and cowardly abandon ment of a loyal and faithful servant when Bakr Sidqi marched on Bagdad. c 0 Quite recently, as I reported in my despatch N o. 563 jM the 16th November, he ^ was freely speaking of His Majesty in the most contemptuous terms. I have 2&gt; reported in my telegram N o, 218 o f to-day’s date the plan which Nuri outlined to me to install the Emir Zeid in the palace, and this arrangement, admirable in fso far as it may lead to a purge of the palace entourage, may well betray an underlying intention eventually to place the Emir Zeid on the throne instead of King Ghazi. His Majesty is already acutely jealous of any attention shown to either the Emir Zeid or to the Emir Abdul lllan, and, if the new Prime Minister ^cts on his plan, His Majesty’s suspicions will certainly be aroused. He will probably react by plotting against the new Government and will naturally look for conspirators in the army. The prospect is disturbing, and little imagination is needed to foresee to what calamities for the country such developments might lead. 12. I happened to visit the King on the morning of the 24th December, when Nuri’s return to Bagdad came, among other subjects, under discussion. I do not think that His Majesty had any more idea of what the day held in store than I had myself. Since the cony, I am told, on reliable authority, that His Majesty is taking credit for having t£ once again saved the country.” 13. I am sending copies of tnis despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Governor-General of India. I have, &amp;c.

Peterson to Viscount Halifax.—(Received December 19.) (No. 606.) My Lord, Bagdad, December 14, 1938. THE Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this morning that the Cabinet had yesterday considered reports prepared by the Director-General of Police concerning the political activities of a number of people in Bagdad, and had decided to issue orders under article 4 of the Law Prohibiting Malicious Propaganda, No. 20 of 1938, compelling six individuals to reside in provincial towns well removed from Bagdad. These orders had been carried out imme diately. The Minister gave me the following names of the banished men :— 1. Colonel (retired) Ismail Haqqi Ibrahim. 2. Colonel (retired) Shakir-al-Wadi. 3. Captain Ali Ghalib. 4. Daud-al-Sa’di. 5. Ali Mahmud-al-Shaikh Ali. 6. Jamil Abdul Wahab. No. 1 was one of Bakr Sidqi’s favourites, and was appointed military attache in London in October 1937. About the middle of 1938 he was recalled to Iraq and placed on pension. No. 2 (“ Personality,” No. 80) was also one of Bakr Sidqi’s right-hand men, and after a very brief tenure of the post of Iraqi Military Attache in London in September 1937 he, too, was retired from the army. No. 3 was one of the officers suspected of the murder of Jafar Pasha-al- Askari in October 1936. No. 4 (” Personality,” No. 25) is a well-known Bagdad lawyer, who for many years has been mixed up in every sort of political trouble. He is a Deputy in the present Parliament and has a special spite against the Government for having suspended him last December for the whole session as the result of an insulting attack which he made on the Ministers during a debate on the very law under which he is now banished from the capital. No. 5 (“ Personality,” No. 13), like No. 4, is a lawyer who is seldom out of political trouble, though his general reputation is less disagreeable. No. 6 is a minor lawyer who, at one time, was one of Nuri Said’s political tools. 2. Taufiq Suwaidi said that the police reports had satisfied the Cabinet that these men were actively engaged in intrigues against the Government and that they were, moreover, implicated in the several bomb-throwing incidents which had recently occurred in Bagdad. One of these incidents happened on the 18th November when a bomb was thrown into a crowded coffee-shop (please see my Saving telegram No. 96). Another took place early in December about 10 o’clock at night in the street outside the Ministry of Defence. Other attempts to throw bombs are also reported to have been made but thwarted by the police and several men have been arrested for being in possession of material for making primitive bombs. 3. Taufiq Suwaidi did not give me details of the political intrigues in which the men now banished from Bagdad had been engaged, but from other sources I learn that they have been giving their help to any dissatisfied elements with which they could establish contact with a view to bringing about the fall of the Govern ment. In particular, they have been collaborating with the moving spirits in the Palestine Defence League so that they may give to their intrigues the appearance of an agitation in support of the cause of the Palestinian Arabs. There are also indications, though nothing amounting to proof, that these people have been in close touch with the German Legation. The German Minister, Dr. Grobba, is [480 t—21well known to dislike the present Government for their declaration of solidarity with His Majesty’s Government during the recent crisis in Europe and he is quite capable of fostering any activities likely to embarrass them. 4. The Minister appeared confident that the Government’s action would be salutary in its effect, but he explained that if subversive activities continued the Cabinet intended to take further measures to maintain order. They had thought it well to begin by dealing with the leading persons concerned; if that was not enough, they would take action against a number of smaller men whom they had under observation. 5. This morning the Bagdad lawyers endeavoured to organise a demonstra tion of law' students to protest against the banishments ordered yesterday. Several of the ringleaders were arrested and the attempt failed. Rashid Ali-al- Gilani seems to have encouraged the movement and I am told that the mutessarif sent for him and warned him that he too would be ordered out of Bagdad unless he mended his ways. 6. The most satisfactory feature in the situation is that the Government now appear to be convinced that the extremist Palestine agitation in Iraq is directed at the Government themselves even more than at the Jews or at His Majesty’s Government. The Minister assured me that adequate steps were now being taken to suppress the special evening news-sheets reporting Palestinian “ atrocities ” (please see my despatch No. 604 of the 13th December) and that the Government were also determined to close down King Ghazi's private trans mitting station (please see my telegram No. 201 of the 7th December). This does ( not mean that Iraq’s essential sympathy with the Arab cause in Palestine has been modified; but it does, I hope, mean that the Government will henceforward deal with breaches of public order, and incitements thereto, wdth a clearer realisa tion of the issues at stake and of the extent to which their own interests are involved. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Governor-General of India. I have, &amp;c. M.

But I would myself draw the conclusion that, since the two principal pretenders to the premiership dislike each otner infinitely more than they do the present incumbent, it is quite on the cards that the present government may continue much longer than anyone would expect. At the same time I ought to add that this is not Edmonds* view since, in his opinion, the government cannot last more than tnree or four months longer. I am myself most anxious not to sec any change until Palestine is settled, since the nature of that settlement will have a profound bearing on our relations with this country and therefore on the kind of government which we shall want to see in power. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Sir Maurice Peterson G. V/. BAXTER, ESQ., M.C1G7 COPY THE POLITICAL C ITU AT ION aIUKIL 1 The following is a note of information and impression gathered from a conversation on July 1st with an old friend whom I had not met for some time. My own comments, or contri bution to the general picture into which his statements fit, are shown in parenthesis (paras. 1 end, 4, 9, 10). The views of a single individual must of course be corroborated from other sources before they can be accepted as correct; but rny friend’s presentation of the situation seems so clear and logical that orima facie it deserves the greatest respect. 1. Until the coup d’etat of Bekir Sidqi the army had hardly concerned itself with internal politics: man^ officers did not know and did not care who was Minister of Defence or G.G.S. Now, not only officers, but N.C.Os and men are ardently inter ested. (I myself date this deplorable development from the Assyrian affair of 1933, the triumphal returns organized for the army, and the glorification of the supreme act of politi cally-inspired indiscipline, the butchery of Simel; the seeds were sown even earlier when the Intelligence Department was organized)• 2. Since the second (Mosul) coup of August 1937 and the expulsion from the Army of fifteen to twenty officers closely associated with Bekir Sidqi, many differences which had previously tended to divide the officers into cliques have disappeared. Officers to-day are almost unanimous; there is an extraordinary degree of mutual confidence; they tell each other their thoughts openly, without fear. The desire of almost all is to see Nuri Pasha/r m (}&amp;% IXI Nuri Pasha and Taha Pacha al Hashimi back in two of the three key posts: Prime Minister or Minister of Jefence or C.G.S 3. The announcement of the appointment of General Water- house, whose attitude towards the Bekir Sidqi coup is well known, has jiven the greatest pleasure. 4 . (The people of Iraq, as they themselves admit, are notoriously, indeed proverbially, fickle. A favourite story that has recently been going round is that of the Caliph Mu 1 awiya, whose last dying injunction to his son Yazid was to keep the people of Iraq quiet by giving theiTi a new Governor every time they wanted one, however frequently. In recent months any non-official civilian (and many officials), asked about the internal situation, would reply: 'There is universal disgustj the Prime Minister is flaoby, tne Minister of Finance insolent and overbearing; the Minister of the Interior is corrupt, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has a similar reputation, though perhaps from the past rather than from the present, the Minister of Justice is a cipher; administrative incompetence is the rule and nobody can get anything done; corruption is rife; the police have gone to the dogs; and so on. These complaints are, however, general rather than specific and vary in intensity as the spokesman has or has not a personal grievance.,. 5. The feeling of the officers regarding the Cabinet and the internal situation is not much different from that of the general public described above, except that the animus against the Minister of the Interior, Mustafa al Umari, is somewhat neutralized by the recollection that he served, so to speax, as a bridge between the Hikmat (Bekir Sidqi) and tne Jamil Madfai (Amin al Umari) regimes. The/6. The interest of the officers in the internal situa tion v/as brought to a head by the Cabinet crisis in the first half of May when Jalal Baban resigned. There was some talk of the appointment in his place of Muhammad Ali Mahmud (as a pseudo-Kurd like Jalal). A deputation of some 30 officers went to Amin al Umari and called upon him to visit the Prime Minister at once to explain tnat the Army objected to the selection of a colleague of Hikmat Suleiman*s (for the tolerance of Mustafa al Umari see previous paragraph) he was further to say that the Army wanted Nuri back. That night all army units were standing by, not on the order of any supreme commander but by agreement between the unit commanders themselves. The appointment of Muhammad Ali was then prevented but Jamil Madfai was elusive regarding Nuri. Since that evening the Prime Minister has been a regular visitor to the Military Club, seeking to cultivate closer relations with the officers. 7. The immediate problem, then, of internal politics, as they see it, is to ensure that when the present Cabinet falls the successor shall be one that inspires confidence, in othgr words that it shall include Nuri and Tana al Sashimi (the latter as Minister or C.G.3.), and on no account Hikmat. S. As regards the King, his personal failings are well known. He favoured Bekir and has seen a great deal of Hikmat lately. Kitmat’s obvious cue is to frighten the King with stories that Nuri would dethrone him if he could. There was some excitement among the officers a week or two back when it was rumoured that the King wanted to put Amin al Umari on pension. It is believed that during the last two years the King has tended to see the British Ambassador, that/that stabilizing influence, less and less# There is thus a danger that the King might try to bring in Hikmat when the present Cabinet falls. That would precipitate a crisis and force the army to intervene. 9. (it is generally believed that Hikmat is politically active at the present time. This activity, in my opinion, is probably defensive rather than offensive. He must keep Nuri out at all costs. If the only way of keeping Nuri out is to come in himself he Yi/ill try to do so. But he will not work for office for its own sake). 10. (Recent happenings at Alexandretta, The Anglo-Turkish ♦ Trade-Credits Agreement, and articles in the English press (in particular one published in the ’Daily Mirror’ is referred to) have given rise to much searching of heart among the politicians. If Great Britain had not stood aside, as a dis interested spectator, they argue, Turkey could not have achieved what she has at Alexandretta. Iraq, an ally, has been trying for months to obtain munitions from Britain cash-down, without success; Turkey, the enemy of yesterday, is to get large quantities on credit. They have convinced themselves that there has been a change in British policy towards the Arabs and ask what is at the bottom of it). 11. It will be convenient to interpolate at this point a reference to sundry vague and detacned remarks of my friend which do not fit into the general picture of the situation as here presented but 'which it may be useful to have on record in case other events later throw light on them. Much money is being spent on propaganda, but its source (German, Italian or Turkish) and the immediate concrete object.are not specified./specified. The Italians continue to work to sell munitions to Iraq. Hikmat is notoriously pro-Turk and frequently sees tne Turkish Minister. The Turkish Consul (? Secretary) is an active propagandist on behalf of Turkey. 12. Returning to Foreign Affairs, the officers share the preoccupations of the politicians as described in para. 10. They conclude that Iraqi foreign policy, particularly towards Great Britain, has failed and requires re-orientation. Perhaps in the past the Army, as a nationalistic creation, was anti rather than pro-British. But Iraq is now independent ana nothing prevents a policy of real frank co-operation in implementation of the Alliance. Apart from the rapprocnement in the domain of higher policy the contact between the Military Mission and the officers and units of the Army could be made more intimate. Under the present system the contacts aro largely formal or of a routine nature - office work at the Ministry, inspections, reports. Sven so the work of the Mission loses much of any galvanic qualities it can develop in such unfavourable circumstances by passing through the respectable but negative personality of tne present C.G.3. 13. Here then, they argue, is an additional and decisive argument for the return of Nuri, supported by Taha. Nuri alone, for all Iraqi statesmen, is qualified by his personal prestige, by his knowledge of Europe and in particular of England, by his experience of collaboration with the British in concrete constructive work (including the negotiation of the Alliance) and by his hold on the affection of the Army here, to put through this change in high foreign policy and its internal military applications. Conclusion . 14. The position, as revealed in this conversation, may be summarized as follows: The officers of the army are profoundly/profoundly dissatisfied with the present situation of Iraq, internal and external. There has, indeed, been some loose talk in a limited circle of provoking tribal risings in the south and then refusing to maro.h, thereby precipitating the fall of the Cabinet - stories that there have been intrigues with the Kurds are denied. But the instinct of the officers as a whole is against taking any political initiative; they want a certain thing done but are unwilling to force it through as a military movement. Positively, they would act to prevent a return to power of Hikmat Sulaiman. negatively, but none the less ardently for that, they wish to see the return to power of Nuri, accompanied for the particular purpose of the Army, by Taha. Today, that is on July 1st, there is no specific intention to bring off a coup d’etat , but all the elements of one are present. A false move, particularly at a moment of Cabinet crisis, might provoke it without notice.

I paid my first call on Nnri Pasha this morning. I told him that glad as I was to see him in office I could not but regret the method by which he had arrived there. It seemed a great pity that the army had again been brought into politics. Nuri Pasha said that there were only two instruments by which the army could be controlled - Parliament and the King. The previous Government had neglected both of these instruments. Pressed to define his meaning he could only, as regards Parliament, promise a General Election (which his English advisers have told him to be unnecessary): but as regards the Palace he intended to place Amir Zeid in close attendance on King Ghazi with the position of [? actual] Comptroller of the Household and with a large measure of authority. The Amir would serve as a channel of communication between the King and the Government and the King and myself. Since Nuri Pasha explained that he regarded it as essential for the future of Iraq, that His Majesty's representative should be able to bring influence to bear upon the King, I told him that I entirely shared this view but I was already in close touch with His Majesty and that if I was not conscious of having offered advice within the last few weeks it was because things had seemed to me to be going pretty well. The last Government had indeed, in my view, been making satisfactory progress which I was sorry to see interrupted. The only accusations which Nuri Pasha could bring against the last Government were that they had not been sufficiently constructive and2 . and that they bad gone too far in banishing an ex-Prime Minister (Rashid Ali ]) he later made a vague reierence to trioal discontent which is understood to be one of his main planhs although both the disease and the remedy are extremely hard to define. Ifaji Shaukat has accepted the Ministry of the Interior which makes the Government already stronger in personnel than its predecessor.

My Lord, i With reference.to my despatch No, 546 of November 4th, I have the honour to report the following recent political developments. 2, Nurl Pasha, on his return to Iraq, on October 22nd, soon became the focus of the usual political rumours, and it must be assumed that he began once more to take stock of his chances of returning to active public life. He met the Counsellor at a small dinner party a week after his return and spoke to him about the situation in this country in the same gloomy terms as he used in conversation with Lord Cranborne last January (please see Mr. Eden*s despatch No, 65 (E 492/45/93) of February 2nd). Nuri Pasha even went so far as to indicate that discontent with the present state of affairs had reached a point at which another violent upheaval was likely to take place, and that if it did, his sympathies would be given to the movement for which, however, he disclaimed responsibility. The Counsellor reserved fuller comment but pointed out at once the mistake of resorting to violence as a remedy for the ills of which Nuri had been speaking, and said that it was evident that what was needed was steady administrative improvement and not political revolution. /Some The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I.y G.C.1.E., etc., etc ., etc.,Some days later, Mr. Houstoun-Boswall, on my instructions, told Nuri Pasha how disturbed I had been to hear that he thought another coup d^tat was possible and again laid emphasis on the folly of attempting by such means to improve the administration of the country. About the same time it was learnt from outside sources that Nuri had a few days earlier, been received by King Ghazi but had been kept standing and dismissed after only a few minutes talk about the weather: the Pasha was much annoyed by this ungracious reception and had been talking freely and disparagingly about His Majesty. 3. Although more is now seen of Nuri in Cairo and London than in Bagdad, I may here record my regretful conviction that this former comrade-in-arms of Lawrence who, at his best, was in a different category from the ordinary run of Iraqi politicians, has greatly deteriorated both in character and judgment, with the passage of years. I have heard this deterioration ascribed to various causes which I forbear to mention since there is no evidence available. But, whatever the cause, my feeling is that Nuri is now entirely dominated by a restless longing for a return t 0 power and influence: and I believe that his reputation has declined considerably in this country who re it is asked: ’’v/ho is this man who will not live in Iraq unless he is a Minister?”• 4. Soon after the opening of Parliament three of the deputies for Diwaniyah resigned their seats. All were important tribal shaikhs and the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior informed me that their resignation was intended to be a gesture of dissatisfaction with the /generalgeneral corruption and incompetence of the provincial officials and with the conscription of tribesmen under the National Defence Lawc Mr 0 Edmonds said that it seemed that the movement was to some extent infectious and that a number of tribal deputies were trying to form a combination strong enough to bring pressure to bear on the Government to redress their grievances. Politicians in Bagdad were not, he thought&gt; behind the tribal shaikhs, but some of them were watching to see how they could exploit the movement to their advantage. From other sources, however, it is reported that Rashid Ali al Gilani has been corresponding with some of his old allies in Diwaniyah, and the possibility that he has encouraged the tribal deputies cannot be excludedo Moreover, during his three weeks visit Nuri Said may have given at least his blessing to the idea of a concerted action by the tribal deputies to embarrass the Government in Parliament. But, I understand, the three deputies have now been induced to withdraw their resignations. 5. The Arab extremists have also been complaining against the Government for their failure to support more actively and openly the cause of the Arabs in Palestine. Indeed, the demonstration of students which quickly degenerated into a riot, as reported in my telegram No. 171 of November 10th, may have been directed as much against the present Cabinet as against Zionism. The Prime Minister, who, as Minister of the Interior, was responsible for dealing with the demonstration, showed lamentable weakness in consenting to the holding of the demonstration on the strength of guarantees which were obviously unlikely to be implemented. This lack of leadership /quicklyloo ) 3(34 quickly infected the police, \/ho did nothing to prevent the moh from wantonly destroying some of the hest shop fronts in the main thoroughfare of Bagdad. The pointless stupidity of the rioting is shown hy the fact that several motor-cars Belonging to Arab teachers in the Secondary School were destroyed and that Muhammedan shop-keepers suffered extensively at the hands of the mot). I spoke strongly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday about these riots and I shall have the honour to address Your Lordship again on the subject so soon as the estimate of damage done to British-owned shops has been completed, 6. The statement of policy made by His Majesty^s Government concerning Palestine on November 9th has for T -he moment quietened agitation concerning the future of that country and thereby strengthened the hand of the Government which appears at present to be maintaining its position. The new oil concession for the south of Iraq recently concluded with the Iraq Petroleum Company was passed in the Chamber on November 12th by 67 votes to 8, in spite of heavy attacks by Rustam Haidar and Taha al Hashimi. Nevertheless, the Cabinet, who have survived now for over a year, will have to show considerable skill and courage if they are to last through the present session, 7* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty ’s Minister at Tehran and to the Governor-General of India.

His Majesty, for the first time since my arrival in Iraq, received me in the presence of the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am inclined to resent this innovation (though I understand it is only a reversion to a previous practice) and I propose, as soon as Taufiq Suwaidi returns, to inform His Excellency accordingly, making it plain that I cannot be expected, e.g., to speak to His Majesty in the sense which Taufiq Suwaidi himself recently desired (please see my despatch No. 213 of the 11th May) in the presence of any of His Majesty’s Ministers. Should this argument prove insufficient, I propose, unless your Lordship thinks it inexpedient, to reserve my right to ask for a private audience of His Majesty whenever I may deem it necessary. 3. At this morning’s audience and after I had -arranged for the King to receive the new Air Officer Commanding and for the Queen to receive my wife, I saw no reason to refrain from raising the chief topic which I wished to discuss—viz., the abuse of the King’s private wireless transmitting station for the broadcasting of provocative news from Damascus. This abuse was recently brought to my notice by an anonymous letter and last night the oriental secretary and I ourselves listened in to a tendentious and objection able broadcast which accused the Palestinian administration of arming the Jews against the Arabs and which cited with satisfaction the day’s list of casualties inflicted on the Jews. I told the King what I had heard and expressed my surprise that news of this kind should be broadcast from His Majesty’s private station. I hoped, I said, that His Majesty would immediately impose some kind of censorship on the messages which were broadcast. The King said that Damascus news was always more or less of a provocative type, to which I retorted that that made it all the more desirable that it should not be relayed from His Majesty’s private station. I mentioned that there had been two cases of kidnapping of Jews in Bagdad recently (the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs intervened to assert that these had been due to personal feuds and not to political or racial motives) and pointed out that outrages of this kind might well derive encouragement from the news sent out from the King’s station. The King agreed that it was most necessary that Iraq should be spared the development of racial feuds and undertook to look into the matter. 4. Doubtless spurred on by my attack and perhaps emboldened by the presence of the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Majesty took me to task on what he termed the delay in supplying Iraq with shells and small-arms ammunition. Alarmed by what he termed the Turkish incursion in the north, the King said that he had recently asked his Chief of the General Staff to what extent Iraq was able to protect herself and was told that there was only a week’s supply of ammunition in the country. I said that I thought complete agreement, save for some minor details of expenditure, had been reached between our two Governments on the question of the supply of munitions and that, if there was any delay in carrying out what we had agreed in regard to any particular item, I should be only too glad to do what I could to remove it. As regards the Turks, 1 reminded His Majesty that my Government had expressed their confidence that the Turks entertained no territorial ambitions south of the Sandjak; and I added that His Majesty’s Ambassador in Turkey, whom I had recently seen while passing through Istanbul, had re-affirmed to me that this was indeed the case. [430 hh—2j2 5. The King seemed to accept these assurances but murmured sotto voce to the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs: “The German stud that we asked for has actually been sent off.” 6. His Majesty then raised the question of the presence of Italian air force officers (he stressed the fact that they were officers since Iraq herself employs certain Italian non-commissioned officers) with the Saudi-Arabian forces. He regarded this infiltration across the Red Sea as fraught with danger for Iraq and he invoked the assistance of Abbas Mahdi to maintain that they looked to Great Britain to stop it. I suggested that Iraq had her own treaty with Saudi- Arabia and could very well speak for herself; but I reminded His Majesty that there were indications that the time may be approaching when the Anglo-Italian Agreement of this spring, which the Iraqi Government had at first professed to regard with some apprehension, might be put into effect and that this would constitute an additional guarantee against the loan of an officer or two being converted into a political foothold. I had, I said, heard rumours that the Saudi-Arabian Government were asking Iraq to supply a military adviser of some kind. Had any such request been received ? The King replied with some heat: “ That was all lies.” 7. I find that His Majesty has spent the entire summer in Bagdad, his projected trip to the north having been abandoned. While I have every reason to know that his Government are unanimous in deprecating any visits to foreign countries on His Majesty’s part, I had heard that they were trying to persuade him to allow them to create a summer residence in the north of Iraq. I thought the opportunity a suitable one, seeing that His Majesty had confronted me with his Minister, to suggest to them both that it was high time that the Govern ment provided their King with a residence outside the capital. I may mention that the Prime Minister told me recently that His Majesty had had serious heart trouble during the summer and had been warned by his doctors of the absolute necessity for a carefully regulated mode of life. 8.

His Majesty the King, in yesterday’s Speech from the Throne at the opening of Parliament, expressed his gratification with the peaceful solution of the recent international crisis which hsid threatened the peace of the world. He expressed his satisfaction with Iraq’s existing relations with foreign Powers and the manner in which she was carrying out her obligations as a member of the League of Nations and an ally of Great Britain. His Majesty went on to refer to Iraq’s relations with neighbouring States, more particu larly Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, and expressed his appreciation of the friendly co-operation which was now being shown between Iraq and these countries. In the course of a brief reference to Syria, the King expressed the hope that she would soon take her place among the other independent Arab States. * * * * * * • His Majesty’s reference to Palestine was as follows: “The endeavours recently made by our Government to express with the utmost clarity the Arab point of view on the question of Palestine have given rise to satisfaction and to the belief that a settlement ensuring the rights of the Arabs in Palestine can be reached. It is hoped that our ally Great Britain will be able to restore peace and tranquillity in that country by achieving such a settlement.” * * • * • .* Iraq’s relations with the Turkish Bepublic and with Iran, said the King, were cordial. The growing friendship between the members of the Four-Power Pact— Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan —was clearly demonstrated at the recent meeting of representatives of the four countries at Geneva. His Majesty went on to express his complete approval of the commer cial treaty which will shortly be • concluded between Iraq and Egypt. This, he said, would be of mutual advantage to both countries. • * * * W - It was a source of much grati fication to the King that the country was enjoying peace. This had enabled the State to turn its attention to the improvement of communications, the require ments of public health, educational reforms, and the settlement of nomadic tribes in areas where irrigational projects had been com pleted. In this connection his Majesty said that important irriga tion schemes were now in course of construction, and steps were being taken to carry out the plans for an oil refinery and the Habba- niyah escape. Great progress had been made towards the completion of the new railway from Baiji to Tel Kutchuk, and with the con struction of the two Baghdad bridges. He foreshadowed the construction of a third bridge across the Tigris for the Iraqi State Railways. His Majesty closed his economic survey with a reference ^er^a-wc^ineolumn-d) Continued frem column 1 to the conclusion of a new agree ment for the exploitation of oil in Southern Iraq. c * * • * * Turning to the defences of the country, King Ghazi said that great efforts would continue to be made to raise the efficiency of the Iraq Army.

THE recent crisis in Central Europe having provided the first occasion of its kind for consultation with the Iraqi Government in view of possible action under article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, it may be useful for me to give your Lordship a more connected account of this consultation and its results than that contained in the various telegrams which have passed between your Department and this embassy on the subject. 2. Before the crisis became acute, I had already received, semi-officially, the views of your Department with regard to certain matters affecting the question of mutual consultation under the treaty; and I had been asked for the views of myself and of the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, as to how far His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would require the assistance of Iraq in case they were involved in war, either with Germany alone or with Germany and Italy together. I accordingly consulted the air officer commanding and, as I had the honour to inform you in my telegram No. 134 of the 25th September, our conclusions were that the minimum of co-operation wRich the Iraqi Government should provide in accordance with the treaty to enable the air officer commanding to carry out the movements for which he would probably become responsible in the contingencies envisaged were as follows. The Iraqi Government should— (a) Take forthwith certain preliminary precautions, such as reinforcemept of existing police guards on bridges and the locating and keeping track of potential enemy nationals in Iraq, and (b) On the outbreak of war in Europe, remove the enemy diplomatic and consular officers from Iraq and intern or deport all enemy nationals; provide military guards for all essential communications; and strictly supervise the frontiers in order to prevent the entry into the country of enemy agents. I informed your Lordship that, unless I was instructed to the contrary, I proposed to request the Iraqi Government to take the preliminary precautions forthwith; and you were good enough, in your telegram No. 140 of the 26th September, to signify your concurrence in this course. You pointed out, however, that any new system for controlling the movements of foreigners in Iraq would have, for the moment at least, to be nominally applicable to all foreign nationals, and that it would not do to discriminate against the nationals of certain countries in peace time on the grounds that they were potential enemies. 3. Your Lordship had already been good enough to send me, in your telegram of the 13th September (No. 404 to Cairo) and certain later telegrams, summaries of the development of events''Tft Central Europe and the part played by His Majesty’s Government therein, for the confidential information of the Iraqi Prime Minister. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs was therefore not unprepared when, on the 27th September, I approached him in the agreed manner with regard to the preliminary precautions which it was desirable that the Iraqi Government should take. As reported in my telegram No. 137 of that date, Saiyid Abbas Mahdi undertook to take the precautions suggested, and promised orally the full co-operation of the Iraqi Government in the event of war. I expressed to him my appreciation; and I added an expression of the keen appreciation of his statement by His Majesty’s Government also when, on the following day, in accordance with the instructions contained in your Lordship’s telegram No. 143.jjf the 27th September, I apprised him formally that, with [430 aa—1]2 reference to the second sentence of article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, His Majesty’s Government were likely at any time to need the facilities specified in the last sentence of that article for the movement of reinforcements. 4. On the same evening—The 28th September—the Prime Minister, as I reported in my telegram No. 143 of the 29th September, asked me to go to his house. On arrival there I found fljat the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were also present. Saiyid Jamil-al-Madfai said that, in the first place, he wished to tell me that the German Minister had that morning asked what would be the attitude of the Iraqi Govern ment in the event of war. The Prime Minister had reminded him of the obliga tions of Iraq under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which the Iraqi Government had naturally no intention of evading. Dr. Grobba had then suggested that, if the procedure under the Covenant of the League of Nations had not been complied with, it might not be necessary for the Iraqi Government to participate in any war if it came. Saiyid Jamil-al-Madfai briefly dismissed this objection and told Dr. Grobba that, in the event of war, he could not have German nationals at liberty on Iraqi territory. 5. The Prime Minister continued that he wished to confirm to me in the most formal manner the assurance of Iraqi co-operation with His Majesty’s Government; and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs handed me a note (the text of which I had the honour to transmit to your Lordship in my despatch No. 479 o f the 28th September) to that effect. I expressed appreciation. Saiyid Jamil-ai-Madfai then expressed the earnest hope that, should the financial position of Iraq suffer from war through, for example, the closure of the Mediterranean to merchant vessels (which would mean that no oil would go from Kirkuk, with the consequent loss of oil royalties to the Iraqi Government), or if the economic position of the population should become such that Government assistance should be necessary, the Iraqi Government could look to their allies for aid. 6. As stated in my telegram No. 143, I was much struck by the complete spontaneity with which the Iraqi Government had offered to meet their treaty obligations. In all my conversations with them on this subject it was mutually assumed, as a matter of course, that they would be on our side. They evinced no tendency whatever to bargain about anything, and in this respect the subject of Palestine was conspicuous by its absence. I therefore felt it well to suggest to your Lordship the desirability of a personal message of appreciation being sent to Saiyid Jamal-al-Madfai, either by yourself or by Mr. Chamberlain, together with an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would give their most sympathetic consideration to any request for financial assistance which the Iraqi Government might feel^ obliged to make in the event of the difficulties to which they had referred materialising. 7. The passing of the erisis^vm^^i’eeted in this country with very great relief, and it was not long beforem^iraqi Government, as I reported in my telegram No. 147 of the 2nd October, asked me how long the preliminary precautions which they had taken were likely to be necessary since they entailed expense. I replied that I thought they would be necessary for at least ten days longer; in view, however, of the fact that the air officer commanding, on the 4th October, had informed me that he had that day received orders authorising him to revert to normal conditions, I thought it well, as reported in my telegram No. 150 of the 4th October, to pass this information on to the Iraqi Government, in order~'hat they should not be put to trouble and expense for longer than was necessary in connexion with the special precautions which they had taken.

This law supersedes the ordinance forwarded Uu in Mr. Bateman’s despatch No l 312 of the 25th June, 1936. 2. The provisions of the law are not very different to those of the ordinance. The main point is the omission of article 8 of the latter which permitted the Privy Council to redistribute, or withhold, the allowances granted to members of the Royal family under the Iraqi budget. 3.

CONFIDENTIAL. [ 19 oil j Section 2. E 4504/1982/93] Copy No. Sir M. Peterson to Viscount Halifax.—(Received Jidy 29.') (No. 315. Confidential.) My Lord, Bagdad, July 12, 1938. IN your telegram N o. 85 o f the 18th June you instructed me to make repre sentations to the Iraqi Government regarding the misuse of funds collected ostensibly for charitable purposes in Palestine, while in your telegrams Nos. 91 an d 95 of the 28th June and the 4th July you have likewise instructed me to let 8'7 * '• the Iraqi Government know that they are not expected to offer the Mufti asylum in this country. 2. In the difficult and dangerous circumstances created in all Arab countries by the long-continued troubles and uncertainty in Palestine, these instructions place, to my way of thinking, a very heavy strain on the alliance between the United Kingdom and Iraq. 3. I am thereby led to consider whether, in fact, everything possible is being done by His Majesty’s Government, on the other side of the picture, to lead the Iraqis to realise the value of the alliance with Great Britain and thus to ease the strain. I regret to say I feel no hesitation at all in answering this question in the negative or in reaching the conclusion, to which I venture to draw your Lordship’s earnest attention, that a certain lack of imagination leads us to' put the Iraqi alliance, as it were, into cold storage, in the fond, but probably quite mistaken, belief that when the time comes it will be possible to take it out in a condition fit for use. 4. I am aware that every possible opportunity is taken in Parliament to include the Iraqi alliance amongst the commitments of His Majesty’s Government and to proffer full assurance that this particular commitment will be observed, if and when the time comes. But what I am now referring to is not the question of the assistance which we shall offer Iraq in the event of war, but the peace-time measures and menagements by which the vitality of the alliance is, or ought to be, maintained. Such measures are needed, not only to strengthen the alliance to withstand the strain imposed by events in Palestine, but also to enable it to contend with the competitive struggle for influence which is now an outstanding feature of international policy in the Middle East. 5. From this point of view it is unfortunate that the healthy growth and development of a real friendship between the two countries on the basis of the alliance has been retarded by the experiences which, in recent years, have often led Iraq to believe that His Majesty’s Government, though zealous in safe guarding the rights acquired under the treaty of 1930, are not always equally mindful of their own obligations under that instrument. 6. I need hardly say that the most damaging of these experiences has been the difficulties encountered in obtaining for the army the military stores (particularly artillery) which the Iraqi General Staff have felt to be so urgently needed to give the Government the strength to maintain internal order and to defend their frontiers. These difficulties with the concurrent—but I admit quite necessary—insistence of His Majesty’s Government on the proper observance of the last paragraph of article 6 of the annexure to the treaty of 1930, continue to be a cause of telling criticism of the alliance. Added strength has, moreover, been given to these criticisms by the popular misconceptions which are current about the large credits recently arranged by His Majesty’s Government for Turkey. Even in the highest political quarters damaging contrasts have been drawn between the grant to Turkey of credits amounting 'to £6 million for war material and the cash-down terms which rule the purchases of munitions made in Great Britain by the Iraqi Government. The emphasis which I have placed lyiVj , upon the consideration advanced in your Lordship’s telegram No. 88 of the 27th June, viz., that Turkey is not being assisted to buy arms which are withheld from Iraq, cannot be expected wholly to remove this feeling. [355 ff—2]2 /w A TV, ^r ^' 7. The Turkish credits have also revived some of the bitterness of the disappointment which was felt in Iraq at the unsatisfactory outcome of the loan negotiations which took place last year. The seemingly immense difference in t le results achieved by Turkey compared with those obtained by Iraq has inevitably suggested that Iraq did not receive the same good offices from His Majesky s Government as did Turkey. . 8. Another treaty arrangement which has not worked w r ell is that Y\nich concerns foreign officials. The Iraqi Government have more than once been reminded of the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to securing that all foreign officials engaged on Government service are British subjects. But at the same time, as in the instance of the nomination of an adviser to the Ministry of Economics and Communications, it is often revealed that his Majesty's Government have the greatest difficulty in finding suitable candidates for posts which are vacant. That this difficulty arises, not from lack of goodwill but from lack of organisation, does nothing to lessen the irritation which is caused by the long delays which so often follow a request for a British official and the feeling that, in this regard, the treaty is irksome rather than helpful is strengthened by the easy assurances (spurious though they may be) given by my diplomatic colleagues that other countries could at once provide eminent specialists at much lower salaries than any British subject of a similar standing would ever accept. 9. I am not unmindful of the fact that, both in the manner in which they seek to engage British officials and in their treatment of those who enter their service, the Iraqi Government are frequently at fault. But it is only to be expected that they should see the mote in our eye more clearly than the beam in their own. Or, as an Iraqi would put it, it is only natural that they should judge His Majesty’s Government by a higher standard than they would apply to themselves. 10. Other matters which have fostered criticism of Iraq’s special relations with Great Britain are the difficulties which stand in the way of arranging full staff training for Iraqi officers in British staff colleges and the cold reception which is given to Iraqi efforts to enter into staff discussions of defence plans for their own country. The first is not perhaps a serious grievance, but the second has, I fear, often exacerbated feeling here. The Iraqi General Staff officers feel that, under article 4 of the treaty, Great Britain has positive advantages of the greatest value, whereas what Iraq is to receive in return, by vcay of aid from Ereat Britain in the capacity of an ally, is unsatisfactorily vague and ill-defined. I believe that much could be done to dispel this feeling if more sympathy were shown toward Iraqi overtures for discussions on this point, and it seems to me that it should be possible to do this without incurring undesirable commitments. 11. In the field of foreign policy, too, the Iraqis have found reason for disappointment with the fruits of the alliance. For example, in connexion with the recent conclusion by His Majesty’s Government of their tentative agreement with Italy, the stipulation in the Iraqi treaty that t£ there shall be full and frank consultation between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests ” was interpreted by His Majesty’s Government as being covered by notification to the Iraqi Government only five days in advance of what they intended to do (please see your Lordship’s telegram No. 53 of the 11th April). The agreements themselves were afterwards found to contain a number of matters which are of very considerable importance to Iraq and which in effect drew from her a formidable questionnaire (please see my despatch No. gQ^ of the 4th May). 12. Then there is Palestine. Although His Majesty’s Government have accepted and given careful consideration to communications sent through the diplomatic channel, there has been little or no visible response to the Iraqi Government’s representations on this subject. In consequence, the impression has been given that the spirit of the alliance has not received all the consideration that it should. Developments in Palestine cannot be said to be of no concern to the Iraqi Government, and, though it is true that in consultation there is a risk of raising false hopes, the seemingly unapproachable aloofness of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards friendly Arab opinion in this country where Palestine is concerned has inflamed feeling in this country. 13. The only way to strengthen our position so that it may bear the strains to which I have referred at the beginning of this despatch lies, I submit, in aSi e&gt; \y m 3 studied endeavour to ensure that in the future the alliance shall produce benefits which shall be a constant reminder of its advantages to the Iraqi Government and people. 14. I therefore venture to offer some general suggestions as to the manner in which this object might be achieved :— (ft) Firstly, it is, above all, essential that everything possible should be done to make a favourable, sympathetic and early response to the Iraqi request for munitions which I communicated to your Lordship in my despatch No. 215 of the 13th May. I gladly recognise the promising beginning which has been made in dealing with rifles and 3-,7-inch howitzers. (5) Secondly, I feel that His Majesty’s Government should volunteer to consider ways and means to help Iraq carry out her five-year plan. I am satisfied that it will soon be found that this cannot be done without credit facilities of some kind, and I am convinced that a happy impression would be made if His Majesty’s Government were to offer their help. Perhaps the best plan would be for an invitation to be extended to the Iraqi Government to send a small mission to London to discuss ways and means. (c) Thirdly, I recommend that we should try to make a greater show of close consultation with the Iraqi Government on matters of foreign policy of common interest to both countries. Occasions for doing this should not be difficult to find and, in general, a little confidence will go a long way. The annual autumn meetings of the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, which are often attended by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, afford an opportunity for easy contacts, and I am informed that, on all occasions in the past on which your Lordship’s predecessors have got into touch at Geneva with an Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, the results have well repaid the trouble taken. Other opportunities would have to be sought through the diplomatic channel and I am sure that even a small increase in the intimacy and confidence shown by His Majesty’s Government towards Iraq, through this medium, would have a gratifying influence on mutual relations. {d) Fourthly’ there is the question of advice on matters other than those connected with foreign affairs. I have stressed the need for improve ment in the arrangements made for furnishing Iraq with British technical officials, and I should like now to go a step further and to suggest that our position as guide and mentor to Iraq would be greatly strengthened if, from time to time, His Majesty’s Government were to volunteer to furnish authoritative advice on current internal, economic and technical problems without cost to the Iraqi Government. The success of the work of the British Council is an example of the big return obtained for a comparatively small expenditure. But it is not only in the realm of culture that it is desirable to consolidate British influence, and methods similar to those employed by the British Council could be well applied with even greater material gain to the economic field. 15. It is appropriate here to refer to the great success of the arrangements made earlier in the year for the visit to the United Kingdom of the Director- General of Training and Instruction in the Ministry of Education. It is not top much to say that that visit and its satisfactory results have profoundly changed the attitude of the Ministry of Education. Trust has largely replaced suspicion, and an appreciation of an eagerness for British education has grown up where American theories once held the field. I think the moral is that the same methods could with much advantage be applied to other departments. I should like, for example, to be able to arrange for a, selected Iraqi irrigation engineer to visit India to see some of the major irrigation works which have been constructed there and the immense areas which through them have been brought under cultivation and colonised. More frequent visits to the United Kingdom by the Iraqi army chiefs might also do much to improve the temper of the Ministry of Defence.2 mmm 7. The Turkish credits have also revived some of the bitterness of the disappointment which was felt in Iraq at the unsatisfactory outcome of the loan negotiations which took place last year. The seemingly immense difference in the results achieved by Turkey compared with those obtained by Iraq has inevitably suggested that Iraq did not receive the same good offices from His Majesty s Government as did Turkey. 8. Another treaty arrangement which has not worked well is that which concerns foreign officials. The Iraqi Government have more than once been reminded of the importance which His Majesty's Government attach to securing that all foreign officials engaged on Government service are British subjects. But at the same time, as in the instance of the nomination of an adviser to the Ministry of Economics and Communications, it is often revealed that His Majesty's Government have the greatest difficulty in finding suitable candidates for posts which are vacant. That this difficulty arises, not from lack of goodwill but from lack of organisation, does nothing to lessen the irritation which is caused by the long delays which so often follow a request for a British official and the feeling that, in this regard, the treaty is irksome rather than helpful is strengthened by the easy assurances (spurious though they may be) given by my diplomatic colleagues that other countries could at once provide eminent specialists at much lower salaries than any British subject of a similar standing would ever accept. 9. I am not unmindful of the fact that, both in the manner in which they seek to engage British officials and in their treatment of those who enter their service, the Iraqi Government are frequently at fault. But it is only to be expected that they should see the mote in our eye more clearly than the beam in their ow r n. Or, as an Iraqi would put it, it is only natural that they should judge His Majesty’s Government by a higher standard than they would apply to themselves. 10. Other matters which have fostered criticism of Iraq's special relations with Great Britain are the difficulties which stand in the way of arranging full staff training for Iraqi officers in British staff colleges and the cold reception which is given to Iraqi efforts to enter into staff discussions of defence plans for their own country. The first is not perhaps a serious grievance, but the second has, I fear, often exacerbated feeling here. The Iraqi General Staff officers feel that, under article 4 of the treaty, Great Britain has positive advantages of the greatest value, whereas what Iraq is to receive in return, by way of aid from Great Britain in the capacity of an ally, is unsatisfactorily vague and ill-defined. I believe that much could be done to dispel this feeling if more sympathy were shown toward Iraqi overtures for discussions on this point, and it seems to me that it should be possible to do this without incurring undesirable commitments. 11. In the field of foreign policy, too, the Iraqis have found reason for disappointment with the fruits of the alliance. For example, in connexion with the recent conclusion by His Majesty’s Government of their tentative agreement with Italy, the stipulation in the Iraqi treaty that “ there shall be full and frank consultation between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests ' was interpreted by His Majesty’s Government as being covered by notification to the Iraqi Government only five days in advance of what they intended to do (please see your Lordship’s telegram No. 53 of the 11th April). The agreements themselves were afterwards found to contain a number of matters which are of very considerable importance to Iraq and which in effect drew from her a formidable questionnaire (please see my despatch ^ , No. 20i,of the 4th May). 12. Then there is Palestine. Although His Majesty’s Government have accepted and given careful consideration to communications sent through the diplomatic channel, there has been little or no visible response to the Iraqi Government's representations on this subject. In consequence, the impression has been given that the spirit of the alliance has not received all the consideration that it should. Developments in Palestine cannot be said to be of no concern to the Iraqi Government, and, though it is true that in consultation there is a risk of raising false hopes, the seemingly unapproachable aloofness of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards friendly Arab opinion in this country where Palestine is concerned has inflamed feeling in this country. 13.

IT occurs to me that some account of the latest Cabinet crisis anything so essentially trivial can be so described—may be of interest as showing conditions in this country. 2. The black sheep in the present Cabinet is possibly Jalal Baban, the Minister of Economics and Communications. So far as I have been able to discover, this gentleman's sole qualification for ministerial office lies in a somewhat nebulous claim to represent the Kurdish part of the population. His defects are more obvious and consist, in part at least, of the usual vices of nepotism and corruption. In particular, he recently cancelled the contract of a British official in his department, who had repeatedly protested against the Minister’s authorisation of money advances to the contractor—apparently some kind of a relative of his—engaged in the construction of the road from Ramadi towards Syria. (I hasten to add that proper compensation was paid to the British official concerned, Mr. Rover, that the latter did not appeal to this Embassy and that he had, I believe, left the country before I heard of the affair at all.) ' Jalal Baban, however, carried his championship of the contractor into the meetings of the Cabinet. Having advocated that the latter should be paid at a higher rate than that authorised in the contract, on the ground that he found himself compelled to employ more expensive materials than he had expected, the Minister appears to have been taken sharply to task by his colleague of Finance, and heated words were exchanged. My authority for this last incident is Taufiq Suwaidi, the Foreign Minister. 3. Jalal Baban thereupon presented his resignation, which would, I think, have been accepted had it not been that the Finance Minister took the opportunity to demand a thorough Cabinet reconstruction. To this the Prime Minister, who is essentially conservative, was most reluctant to agree, preferring apparently to consider resigning himself. Efforts were accordingly made, and have now proved successful, to induce Jalal Baban to withdraw his resignation. 4. The Foreign Minister, at my weekly meeting with him yesterday, spoke of these efforts and assured me that any danger of the Cabinet’s resignation was then over, whatever might be the fate of the Minister of Communications. I remarked that it might be a mistake to apply too much pressure on this particular Minister to reconsider his decision, but that, while I did not feel called upon to pronounce whether the existing Cabinet was, in fact, a good or a bad one, it did appear to me very necessary that the Iraqis should break away from their habit of short-lived Ministries, since continual change gave a feeling of instability in the country and conveyed a sense of weakness abroad. 5. The Foreign Minister thereupon hinted in unmistakable terms that the danger of the Cabinet falling, such as it had been, had been due to the King and thaC in fact, if His Majesty had had his way, there would have been two or three changes of Government in the last few months. His Excellency had heard that I was to pay my fortnightly visit to King Ghazi to-day and expressed his anxiety that I should speak to His Majesty on exactly the same lines as I had spoken 6. I gave this promise all the more readily in that I had already decided to do what the Minister asked. i i tt- 7. At my audience with King Ghazi this morning I therefore told His Majesty that i assumed he would be delighted that the crisis was over since it was only two or three weeks ago that His Majesty had expressed to me his great confidence in his present Prime Minister and his anxiety that the Government should continue in office. I went on to speak of the inconveniences and dangers [305 z—2]wmmmmmmmmmrnK 2 /\ of these continual changes. The King assured me that he was indeed delighted that matters were back where they were before, but added that he thought the Prime Minister had made a mistake in not getting rid of the Minister of Communications. In this I felt obliged to agree. 8. I have in recent despatches attempted to show that His Majesty is now making serious efforts to play a role in the government of the country. It must, ' I fear, be added that the King is too much under the influence of whomever he may have last spoken to to be trusted not to confuse the proper exercise of his influence with mere purposeless changes of his Government.

WITH reference to Mr. Morgan’s despatch No, 84 of the 9th March, I have the honour to report the following developments in the internal political situation :— 116 2. After wdiat they regarded as their successful handling of the agitation against the ratification of the Persian Frontier Treaty, the present Iraqi Govern ment seemed to be settling down again comfortably in the saddle and to be looking ahead with renewed confidence. During the last few days, however, events have occurred which have once more disturbed their equanimity. 3. At a debate on the Bill to indemnify those who took part in the events which followed the murder of Bakr Sidqi last August (referred to in Mr. Morgan’s despatch N o. 53 of the 8th February), which took place in the Senate on the 17th March, Rashid Ali-al-Gilani attacked Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government, and, with much sanctimoniousness, deplored the methods which they had adopted to overthrow Yasin Pasha’s last Cabinet (in which Rashid Ali had been Minister for the Interior). This was too much for the Prime Minister (who had himself been turned out of office in 1935 by a tribal insurrection engineered by Rashid Ali and Yasin), and, rounding on Rashid Ali, he upbraided him with unparliamentary frankness for his own political past. This wordy quarrel in the Senate was taken up gleefully in the newspapers, whose editors had for some while been busily engaged in mutual recriminations concerning the inconsistency of their respective attitudes towards Yasin’s Government, firstly, while Hikmat Sulaiman was in office and, later, since the recent apotheosis of Yasin as a national hero. 4. Some outspoken attacks on the work of Yasin’s Cabinet developed in this manner, and the surviving members thereof felt obliged to take action to defend their reputation. They accordingly submitted a joint petition asking that Parliament should order a judicial enquiry into the charges which were being made against them. 5. When this petition came before the Chamber there was a good deal of public washing of dirty linen, and Rashid Ali was the particular target of some of the tribal Deputies’ sallies. The Prime Minister appealed to the Chamber to bury the past, and the majority of Deputies were evidently in favour of that course. The result was a resolution passing the petition to the Legal Committee, from which it will probably never return. 6. As often happens in this country, however, the consequences of events of this kind are felt much more outside than within Parliament, The ex-Ministers of Yasin Pasha’s last Cabinet are now saying that the Prime Minister has broken his pledge to hold the balance between them and their enemies, and that, while preaching forgiveness and forbearance, he has allowed their detractors to drag their names in the mud. The conclusion which they are said to draw is that they are no longer under any obligation to abstain from intriguing against the Prime Minister. In addition, Rashid Ali has, the story goes, sworn revenge for his humiliation in the Senate (which made the coffee-shop public hug themselves with glee), and has inspired an attack on the most vulnerable member of the present Government, the Minister of the Interior. Mr. Morgan has already reported that this Minister, Mustafa-al-Umari, has for some time been much criticised for corruption, and small leaflets have now been put into circulation giving a short account of some ten instances in which it is alleged that he has accepted laro-e , bribes. r s 7. The Prime Minister is upset and has begun to think of reorganising his Cabinet. He has tentatively offered the Ministry of the Interior to Umar Nazmi [280 1—1](a former Mutessarif of Mosul and now Director-General of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance), but Umar Nazmi has shown his unwillingness to join the Cabinet unless other changes are also made. He would like Nuri Said to be included at Defence or the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and he advises that Nasratal Farisi (until recently permanent Iraqi delegate at Geneva) should be put into Finance or Justice. The Prime Minister is pondering these things in his mind, but he is also, it is said, thinking of the advantages or resigning altogether. In that event, he has confided to a friend, he would recommend King Ghazi to invite Naji Shaukat or Taufiq Suwaidi to form a Government. Of the two, I think the former would be the better choice. But while it may be true that Jamil Madfai is thinking over these ideas, it is not, of course, at all certain that he will put any of them into effect, and there is an almost equal probability that he will decide to let things go on as they are. 8.

[E 172/45/93] Copy No. Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—{Received January 10, 1938.) (No. 508. Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, December 25, 1937. THE dumbshow of the Iraqi elections took place some days ago and, as was to be expected, all the Prime Minister’s nominees, by no means a bad lot, secured their seats in Parliament. It cannot be said that they won them, for, in this country, the unhappy elector has no choice but to vote for the name that is put before him, and outside the Prime Minister’s list there were no names. And so Jamil Madfai may be said to have assured himself of a robust majority. But I much doubt whether he has thus girt himself with any new strength. Indeed, it is more probable that from now onwards fresh difficulties will begin to gather about him. I mean the kind of difficulty that will sooner or later bring about his fall, for the pleasant calm that always goes before elections is over and the time has come for malcontents to sniff the air for trouble. 2. Jamil Madfai came into office in admittedly uncomfortable circumstances. That he has given his country four months of unbroken calm is something which calls for praise. At the same time, it should be remembered that he has been helped by the very circumstances that brought him to power—the impact of the murder of Bakr Sidqi upon the Iraqi mind and, with the deep relief at his disappearance, a general determination that lessons must be learned and that such things must never be allowed to happen again; and, from all this, a genuine and widespread desire for a spell of political peace. But Iraqi memories are short and this heyday is now probably touching its end. The quiet of the past few months and what the Prime Minister has contributed towards it will soon be forgotten, all the more so because his Government have little else to their credit. They have been much the same as any other Government. No freshness has, in fact, blown through Iraqi affairs with the coming of Jamil Madfai. It is to be foreseen, therefore, that the volatile Iraqis will soon be asking themselves why he should remain in office. By the law of averages, his term should be about nine months. Four have already run, and I am disposed to doubt whether he will survive to complete the remaining five. 3. Most of his present difficulties are a legacy from his predecessors. They are by no means inconsiderable—King Ghazi’s failure to play his part in the affairs of State, the army, the problem of the murders of Jafar and Bakr Sidqi and, most portentous, the homing of the exiles, who have all in their time tasted power and are now excluded from it. Of these, Nuri Said has been the most notable and the most disquieting. 4. The question of King Ghazi is no new one. It has often been my duty to report that His Majesty continues to shirk the part required of a Sovereign in a polity which depends for its usefulness upon the proper balance of the Crown, the Executive and the Legislature. He seems to draw but little profit from the several lessons he has had in his short reign. His heart still leans towards internal-combustion engines and his own private pleasures and away from the affairs of his country; and he leaves empty the place of the head of the State which his father so amply filled. Thus the equilibrium is upset. This emptiness has long preoccupied Iraqi statesmen of all parties. In his day Yasin-al-Hashimi felt it and turned over in his mind a project for the creation of a Crown Council to advise King Ghazi. But circumstances obliged him to be harsh with His Majesty and, perhaps for this reason, he never saw his way to put the project into effect. Hikmat Sulaiman, in his turn, glanced at it only to reject it as inexpedient for the moment. Now Jamil Madfai has taken it up again and seems bent upon pushing it through. He claims to have secured the assent of King Ghazi and the support of all Iraqi politicians of account. His Majesty’s acquiescence looks like an admission of failure, or can it be that he has learned [205 k—2] 120one thing—that his throne is at best but a precarious affair ? When I sstw him on my return from leave, he told me that amongst the papers left behind by Bakr Sidqi was a plan for the setting up of a dictatorship which left no room for a King. I gathered that he had been somewhat shaken by this uncomfortable discovery. 5. As now foreseen, the Crown Council would be under the chairmanship of the head of the Senate and would include the President of the Chamber, ex officio, and two ex-Prime Ministers chosen Pope-wise from amongst the other ex-Prime Ministers. The function of the council would be to advise King Ghazi upon certain specific matters. I do not propose to describe the plan now. That may be reserved for another despatch. Neither the Prime Minister nor anyone else with whom I have discussed it regards the council as a solution of the problem. They have all taken refuge in the view that it is at any rate better than the present state of nothingness and must be given a trial. This is probably the best that can be said for it, since it will, I think, take the Iraqis a couple of generations to produce a handful of elder statesmen who may be counted upon to have the wisdom and the courage to set aside their personal and political ambitions and give disinterested advice. 6. With the army Jamil Madfai claims to be working with determination, but he is moving with characteristic slowness. He assures me that, if given time, he will be able to convince the corps of officers that politics do not pay. It has been for this very purpose that he has kept for himself the portfolio of Defence. It may be worth while to note in passing that Amin-al-Umari, who was, it seems, sharply checked, now abstains from any overt attempt to exercise political influence. Nevertheless, there are many, and Nuri is amongst them, who scoff at the Prime Minister’s optimism and predict that more trouble is to be expected from the army so soon as time has deadened the shock of recent events. For myself I have no means of testing the result of the Prime Minister’s efforts, nor are the members of the British military mission able to help me. But at present I tend to agree with those who think that the recent military intrusion upon politics will prove to be no passing one. 7. In the matter of the murders of Jafar and Bakr Sidqi, Jamil Madfai is moving with great caution. As I see it, his inclination is to let the one murder cancel out the other, and in this, I should say, he is probably wise. In order, however, to placate one school of thought, he is trying some of the assassins of Jafar for the attempt on the life of Maulad Nukhlis and for the murder of Dhia Yunis, the courts having ruled that the actual killing of Jafar is covered by Hikmat Sulaiman’s Act of Indemnity. But so far the evidence has been slight and a conviction seems doubtful. Meanwhile, as we know, the officer responsible for the murder of Bakr Sidqi has been exonerated and is now on holiday in England. Pressure to bring him to justice will have been much less strong than that which is being brought to bear upon the Prime Minister by friends of Jafar. Whether Jamil Madfai will be able to resist them I cannot say. But it may be taken as certain that Nuri will not rest until Jafar’s death is avenged. Indeed, he talks of the necessity of a purge of all “criminals,” which is to go as far back as Simel, for it is only thus that the body of Iraq can be cleansed. When next he comes to power, therefore, it may be foreseen that many Iraqis will be well advised to leave the country. 8. The list of returned exiles is not unimpressive—Nuri Said, Rashid Ali, Ali Jaudat (three ex-Prime Ministers), Maulad Mukhlis, Taha-al-Hashimi and Rustam Haidar, not to speak of many of the lesser breed that suffered with them. Of these, Rashid Ali and Ali Jaudat are now living in retirement, from which, it is to be hoped, they will never re-emerge. Taha, on the other hand, is showing signs of activity. On his return he demanded, as a matter of prestige, to be reinstated as Chief of the General Staff, but he has had to content himself with a seat in Parliament, as has also Rustam Haidar. 9. Jamil Madfai’s main preoccupation has, of course, been with Nuri. With what hopes Nuri came back to this country it would be idle to guess. But there is little doubt that he thought that a place would be found for him in the Cabinet and that his return would be the sign of a quick and joyous rallying of old supporters. But he was left out in the cold and supporters tended to hang back. Nevertheless, the restless presence of so formidable a personage was disturbing to the Prime Minister and his colleagues; and it soon became clear to Jamil Madfai, who needed none of the frightened promptings of King Ghazi,3 that, so long as Nuri remained in Iraq, the Government’s declared policy of appeasement had only a meagre chance of success. As you are aware, his first move was to offer Nuri the Legation in London. This Nuri refused, but not in such a way as to dash all hope that he might end by accepting. Some few days after my return from leave the Prime Minister came to see me and asked me to use my influence in one of two directions : First, to persuade Nuri to go to London, and, failing that, to seek your assent to a plan, put forward by Nuri himself, to the effect that he should be sent on a mission of mediation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Jews. Jamil Madfai explained that he had no reason to think that it was Nuri’s wish to upset the Government, but that if Nuri stayed in Bagdad and kept his house open, there would inevitably gather about him all the disaffected elements in the country, who, sooner or later, would force him, willy-nilly, to make a bid for power. In the best interests of Iraq, therefore, it was essential that Nuri should leave the country for a time and the Prime Minister was anxious that his departure should be brought about in a way that would not be unpleasing to Nuri himself. If I failed to induce Nuri to become Iraqi Minister in London, would I put the alternative plan before you ? Nuri had many friends amongst the British, the Jews and the Arabs and seemed peculiarly fitted for the task of mediation. I told the Prime Minister that I shared his opinion that in the general interests of peace and quiet in Iraq it was best that Nuri should take a long holiday. If the Iraqi Government wished to appoint him to London, I was sure that he would find a welcome there, but I could hold out no hope that you would take a favourable view of the suggested mediation, which could only have the effect of complicating still further a difficult and painful situation. I consented, however, to see Nuri, and I did so on the evening of the same day. 10. I found him more than disinclined to accept the offer of London and, inasmuch as I knew that you were well enough contented with Raouf Chadirji, I did not feel justified in putting any pressure upon him. To my surprise, however, Nuri himself said that he felt his presence in Iraq to be embarrassing to the Government and professed to be quite willing to go away. He lost no time in putting forward his scheme for mediation between the Arabs and the Jews, and I was obliged to tell him that I saw no chance of its being accepted. He then said that in these circumstances he thought that he would go to Fgypt, where, in a quiet way, he might be able to use his influence for peace in Palestine, but he would do nothing without consulting me. 11. About a week later he called upon me and reverted to the proposal that he should become Iraqi Minister in London. He said that, upon reflection, he was now ready to accept the post if I could give him an assurance that, in the event of another political upheaval such, for instance, as that of October 1936, His Majesty’s Government would not remain aloof in face of the anarchy that was bound to follow. He said that, without some such guarantee as this, he would be unable to accept from the Iraqi Government any appointment which might stand in the way of his speedy return to Iraq if his country needed him. For rather more than two hours he pressed me hard on this point, without, however, being able to give any clear answer to the questions I put to him upon what he meant by His Majesty’s Government’s not remaining aloof. In the end I said that, with the best will in the world, it was impossible for me to give him the assurance he asked for. His Majesty’s Government, as he knew, were deeply interested in the welfare of Iraq and, for this reason, I would give all the help and support in my power to the present Government in their efforts to restore stability and tranquillity after the disturbing events of the last two years. If more help were asked for than had been needed in the past, it would not be refused. But, as he was well aware, His Majesty’s Government would not in principle wish to impose their advice upon any Iraqi Government. It was hard to say precisely what they would do if there were any violent change of government, but I could at any rate tell him that their influence and help would always be upon the side of law, order and good government. After another unsuccessful attempt to engage my sympathies in his scheme to mediate in Palestine, Nuri left me with the impression that he would now give his favourable consideration to the proposal that he should go to London. But, some days later, he came to see me again, in order to tell me that he had finally decided against it and was leaving Bagdad on a visit to Syria, the Lebanon, Egypt and, finally, England, where he expected to arrive in the middle of January. To the great relief of the Iraqi Government, he left for Damascus on the 15th December.12. It would be profitless to speculate upon what is passing in Nuri s uneasy and wayward mind, but we may, I think, take it that he means to keep a close watch upon events in this country from some point whence he may be able to reappear at a moment’s notice, when he thinks that his time has come. We may also assume that he is aiming at an early return to office. He has, indeed, hinted more than once at what he will do in this event. I am inclined to think that the time at which he will try is not far off and that his stay abroad will be a brief one. With this in my mind, I ventured to advise him, before going away, to do all he could to make his reconciliation with King Ghazi more convincing. He acted upon my advice to the extent of seeking an audience with His Majesty, which seems to have passed off agreeably enough. 13. Although he is an old and tried friend, I should not like to see Nuri return to upset the Government of Jamil Madfai, who, humdrum and common place as they are, seem to be what Iraq now most needs and have shown themselves to be readier to co-operate with us than many of their predecessors. But we must, I think, be prepared for some attempt on Nuri’s part to take the lead in Iraqi affairs, and, if he is successful, the sum of old scores still to be paid off will make his reign a troublous one. 14. It would be inappropriate to end this despatch without some mention of Hikmat Sulaiman. I have seen him more than once. He has assured me that he is taking long leave from politics and devoting himself to the tilling of his land. He is on friendly terms with Jamil Madfai and unlikely to do anything to embarrass the present Government. The breach between him and his former colleagues, Jafar Abu Timman and Kamil Chadirji, remains unmended. 15.

The Speech from the Throne, of which I enclose a summary taken from the Iraq Times, contained nothing unexpected. His Majesty, after an opening reference to the exceptional circumstances in which the Government had been formed and to their special task of restoring tranquillity and stability, spoke of the satisfactory state of Iraq's foreign relations and of the desire of the Govern ment to do their best to strengthen the ties of friendship and alliance with Great Britain. He also referred to the policy which would be continued of cultivating the closest relations with brother Arab countries. 3. On the subject of internal affairs, His Majesty spoke of the vital importance of the army and of the efforts which would be made to increase the number of units and to equip them with modern weapons. Education would also, His Majesty announced, received full attention and great endeavours would be made to raise the general standard of education throughout the country. 4. At the first meetings of the two Houses, Saiyid Muhammad-al-Sadr was elected President of the Senate and Saiyid Maulad Mukhlis President of the Chamber. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR. Enclosure. Extract from the Iraq Times of December 24. 1937. THE opening of Parliament yesterday by His Majesty King Ghazi was a spectacular pageant conducted in accordance with the usual procedure. At 10 o’clock in the morning His Majesty arrived at Parliament House, where the following Speech from the Throne was delivered to the assembled Senators and Deputies : — “ In the name of Almighty God I open your Majlis and welcome you, wishing you success. The new Cabinet was formed in somewhat difficult circum stances which made it necessary that steps should be taken to maintain peace in order that the reconstruction of the country, morally and materially, should continue. It was considered advisable that the nation should be consulted and asked to give their verdict on the programme and policy of the new Cabinet. Now that you have been successful in the general election, I have no doubt that you will do your best to serve your country's interests. “It is a source of great satisfaction to us,' continued His Majesty, “ that our relations with foreign States are very friendly, more particularly with neigh bouring States. The Government are doing their best to strengthen the ties of our friendship and alliance with Great Britain. The Government are also continuing the policy of strengthening the friendship and brotherhood between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The visit paid us by the Saudi Crown Prince did a great deal to cement the cordiality existing between us. The fact that the Kingdom of the Yamen has joined the Treaty of Alliance recently concluded between Iraq and [205 d—1]Saudi Arabia has given us great satisfaction. The Government are now trying to strengthen our brotherly relations with the new Syrian State and the other Arab States. Our relations with the Turkish Republic are highly satisfactory, being based on a policy of mutual co-operation. Similarly, our relations with Iran are based on friendship and co-operation, and they have been further improved lately by the conclusion of the Frontier Treaty and other agreements. In order to preserve peace in the Near East the Sa'adabad Pact between Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan was lately signed in Tehran. These treaties will be submitted to you for examination.” His Majesty concluded : “ Our Government are now engaged on the prepara tion of the new budget in a manner that will show a balance between income and expenditure. It is hoped that this aim will be realised chiefly by reducing the expenditure of the State. Development schemes are receiving great attention. These schemes have been provided for in the Five-Year Plan, for which the revenue from the tax on petrol has been set aside. New legislation regarding financial affairs, land settlement, and banks is now being prepared and will be submitted to you in due course. The Government will do their best to preserve from any interference the independence of the judicial machinery, and a new law to ensure this will be submitted to you. The strengthening of the army being of vital importance for the defence of the country, the Government are doubling their efforts to increase the number of units and provide them with modern weapons. The importance of education for Iraq's continued progress being fully recognised, gre^-t endeavours are being made to raise the general standard, and the Government have sent many students to foreign countries to complete their studies.”THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ^ —rf-f-r- EASTERN (Iraq). Q ° ! 19 6 8 J_ December 29, 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [E 7585/14/93] Copy No. (No Sir, 501.) Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received December 29.) Bagdad, December 20, 1937. I HAVE the honour to report that the general election finished on the 18th December and the results were announced on the following day. 2. As you well know there are no organised political parties in Iraq and the election results cannot be analysed on party lines. It may, however, be said that on this occasion the Government chose their candidates carefully with a view to making the new Chamber as fully representative as possible and to including in it all those most likely to devote themselves ably and honestly to the service of their country. It is also satisfactory to record that the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior was closely consulted about the preparation of the lists of official candidates. Three Ministers, Taufiq-al-Suwaidi, Ibrahim Kamal and Abbas Mahdi, have been returned for Bagdad (the remainder sit in the Senate) and Taha-al-Hashimi, the brother of the late Yasin-al-Hashimi and former Chief of the General Staff, has been elected by the same constitu ency. Two former Ministers, Rustam Haidar and Amin Zaki, have been elected, but with the exception of Abbas Mahdi, the present Minister of Justice, and Muhammad Ali Mahmud, the former Minister for Finance, no member of Hikmat Sulaiman’s Administration has been returned and many Deputies who sat in the last Parliament are now absent. 3. Among the new Deputies is Sheikh Khawwam-al-Abbas of Rumaitha, who, it will be remembered, took a prominent part in the Euphrates disturb ances of 1936. 4. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that the Government have under consideration amendments to the electoral law, which will aim at putting an end to the present system whereby the Deputies are virtually nominated by the Cabinet and substituting a more genuine form of election. This is to be done in the main by reverting to the system of special tribal representatives in each constituency which was adopted for the election of the Constituent Assembly in 1924. 5. It is interesting to recall that at that time Iraqi opinion was very much opposed to special tribal representation and that provision for it was only retained in the electoral law for the Constituent Assembly under pressure from the High Commissioner.

IN the last paragraph of my despatch N o. 397 o f the 25th September, I had the honour to inform you of the misgivings inspired in the Iraqi Government by their uncertainty as to the intentions of Nuri-al-Said. Nuri, as reported in my telegram N o. 242. returned to Bagdad on the 25th October, and was met at the airport by the Prime Minister with every outward demonstration of affection. qafj In my teiegram N o. 119, Saving, I had the honour to inform you of the plans which the Iraqi Government were making for finding a satisfactory outlet for Nuri’s energy, which would carry with it a justifiable method of keeping him in funds. On the 31st October 1 paid a visit to Nuri in his house, and found him busy setting his garden in order after a year of neglect. We discussed gardens and houses—he is very proud of his new house—and other neutral topics, with one incursion into local politics, when he made a disparaging remark about His Majesty King Ghazi, with which I felt bound to disagree. He had had an hour’s audience of His Majesty on the previous day. The conversation then turned to Palestine, and he once more advocated the Faisal-Weizmann proposals referred Usfocf- to in paragraph 7 of my despatch, N o. 396 of the 23rd September, which he himself had sponsored. Like most other responsible Iraqis with whom I have spoken, he was ready to contemplate any solution other than partition, which would ensure Arab numerical predominance in Palestine. 2. Yesterday I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my visit to Nuri— I assume that he already knew of it for there was a police guard at Nuri’s residence and I gained the impression that Nuri’s visitors were controlled—and he told me that while Nuri was not likely to do anything at present which might cause disturbance, he was also determined for the present not to leave Bagdad; this, I said, seemed quite natural in view of the interest he clearly took in his new house and garden, &amp;c., hut perhaps in a while shortage of funds might make him more disposed to fall in with the Government’s plans for his—and their— welfare. Whatever may be in store for the Iraqi Government it is undoubtedly all to the good that the unsettling effect which endured so long as Nuri hovered in Syria is ended, and that his return should have been marked by due, but not excessive, manifestations of enthusiasm. 3. Jamil Madfai appears to be going steadily on his way, finances have been straightened out; the army appears to be getting on with its work, though General Amin-al-Umari, the General Officer Commanding the Bagdad garrison, does not yet walk quite sedately at his master’s heel, and some progress is being made with education and social services. In the north, I am told the Shammar are deriving benefit from work being carried out on the extensions of the railway, and are showing some inclination to settle down in places to cultivation. That part of the Dulaim which is within working range of Haditha can improve its conditions by working for the Iraq Petroleum Company, but the southern sections in the neighbourhood of Hit and Ramadi are having so bad a time that many have come in to Bagdad to try to find a living. Conditions among the tribes south of Bagdad, are, I am told, fairly satisfactory, though this term can only be relative in a country where a labourer has to keep himself and his family on less than a shilling a day, and where a desert Arab may not see as much as £1 in cash in a year. The Middle Euphrates tribes remain subdued but not pacified. Their problems still await solution, and those leaders of unrest who were recently ipqxq . released (see my despatch No^379 of the 7th September), have not been allowed to return to their tribes. 4. Tranquillity is above all what Iraq needs. So long as Jamil Madfai retains control there is a chance she may enjoy it, for he is not the man to pursue paths of adventure, either political or economic. [E 6729/14/93] EASTERN (Iraq).

I HAVE the honour to report that, among distinguished political exiles who have recently returned to Iraq are General Taha-al-Hashimi (Personalities, No. 79) and Saiyid Kamil Chadirji (Personalities, No. 39). 2. General Taha, who was Chief of the General Staff under the regime of his brother Yasin, and who, it will be remembered, was on his way back from England at the time of Bakr Sidqi’s coup d'Etat, has been in exile ever since; while Kamil Chadirji, formerly Minister of Economics in the Hikmat Cabinet, resigned last summer with three other Ministers and thought it more prudent to leave the country as his relations with Bakr Sidqi were far from cordial. 3. Nuri-al-Said is stated to have arrived in the Lebanon from Egypt on the 14th September, but it is uncertain when he will arrive in Iraq. Neither King nor Cabinet would appear to be anxious for his presence, but it would not seem possible, in view of the present state of feeling in the country, for them to prevent him from coming back whenever he chooses. I have, &amp;c. OSWALD SCOTT.—THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5656/14/93 September 28, 1937. Section 1. Copy No. Mr. Scott to Mr. Eden—(Received September 28.) (No. 397.) ^ gj r Bagdad, September 25, 1937. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a summary of the political programme issued on the 23rd September by the Jamil-aTMadfai Cabinet and broadcast from the Bagdad radio station. 2. In a statement which served as preface to the programme, the Cabinet, after emphasising the fact that they came into power in “delicate circumstances,’ said that—strong in the confidence reposed in them by Ivmg and people—they would proceed to re-establish stability and to work for the peace and progress of Iraq. . . . 3. True to precedent, the programme is as vague as it is comprehensive. A point of some interest is that, although expression is given to the desire to co-operate with “ allied countries,’’ no specific allusion is made to Iraq s alliance with Great Britain, while special emphasis is laid on the Government’s desire to strengthen this country’s “ brotherly relations ” with the other Arab States. 4. Other points deserving special mention are : the proposed steps to secure an increase in the standard of efficiency required of Iraqi civil servants; the intention of the Government to balance the budget henceforth without the aid of foreign loans; their determination, already expressed on more than one occasion, to keep the army out of politics ; the inclusion in the programme of a number of ambitious projects for judicial reform; and the allusion it makes to the need for pressing on with the railway extension to Mosul and 1 el ivotchek. 5. It will be observed that the Lake Habbaniyah irrigation scheme is among the economic measures advocated in the programme, thereby furnishing a curious example of Iraqi inconsequence, for as recently as the 21st August (cf. my semi official letter to Mr. Baggallay of that date), Abbas Mahdi included among the objections to allowing Imperial Airways to use this lake the danger that the Government would be accused—if they gave the desired permission—of trying to reintroduce bv a back door this very same irrigation scheme. 6. I have the general impression that in spite of professions to the contrary, the Government, who have some of the citizenly virtues of John Gilpin, do not feel very secure in the saddle and are apprehensive that Nuri-al-Said, by a too sudden appearance, may startle their steed and unhorse them. By the interest with which the Acting^ Minister for Foreign Affairs and others enquire of me whether I have news of Nuri, it is evident that they think His Majesty’s Govern ment are in close touch with, if not in actual control of, his movements. I have, &amp;c. OSWALD SCOTT. Enclosure. Iraqi Cabinet’s Statement of Policy. 1. Foreign Affairs.

The reply given by the Iraqi Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to the aide-mdmoire which you left with him does n/t appear to me altogether to be satisfactory since it fails to cover the points raised in my telegram No. _ 136 of the idnd Septe her. It is important that His Majesty's Government should know to what extent Fawzi is being I;ept under supervision and precisely what is meant by the statement made to you by the Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Fawzi is 'still 'regarded as interned' (please see your telegram No&gt;100 Saving of the 26th August.) 2. Unless therefore you have received some further reply to your aide-mdmoix^e covering these points you should renew your enquiry to the Iraqi Government emphasising that His Majesty's Government attach great importance to a close watch being kept on Fawzi's movements. You should add t at an undertaking given by Fawzi himself to refrain from intrigue can, for obvious reasons, hardly be considered as of much, or indeed of any, value aud you should in this connexion draw the Iraqi Government's particular attention to the letter reported by His Majesty's Consul at Damascus to have been sent by Fawzi to the meeting of Arabs at Bludan, in which he declared his readiness to proceed at once to Palestine whenever he was asked to do so by the Arab Higher Committee. This letter was read out at the meeting.3. Finally, if upon consideration you consider it desirable, you are authorised to suggest to the Iraqi Government that it might he a wise precaution, in addition to whatever measures are already being ta&gt;en to control Fawzi's movements, to require him to furnish a substantial surety that he will remain in Iraq for at least twelve months.

NO. 375. (100/74/37) British Embassy, Bagdad. 9th September, 1937. Sir, As I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 353 of August 25th, General Amin al Umari, shortly after restoring to the civil authorities at Mosul the powers which he had temporarily usurped from them on patriotic grounds, arrived in Bagdad - presumably in order to report to the new government on the events in which he had played so prominent a part. 2. This enterprising officer, who many had thought would have become Chief of the General Staff has instead received the Military Command of the Bagdad district, and his name, together with that of the Chief of the General Staff, Hussain Pawzi, figures prominently in the honours list issued on the anniversary of King Ghazi’s accession (September 8 th). There can be little doubt that, in view of the part which he played in recent events, Amin al Umari is now one of the most influential men in Iraq; and the new prime Minister gave outward expression to the feelings of friendship (or gratitude) which he entertains towards him by attending a banquet the other day at the Bagdad Amy Headquarters, in the course of which the General emphasised the/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C. , M.P. , etc., etc., etc.the loyalty of the Army to the nation, the Throne and the (new) Government, I learn, by the way, that, in spite of the apparent popularity of the change of regime, Amin al Umari goes about everywhere closely guarded. He realises no doubt, like the late Bekr, who was usually surrounded by a small army of detectives, that the game of political assassination is one at which two, and even more can play, 3. No news has been received as yet of the date of arrival of Nuri as Said, who is stated in the press to have been attending an Arab conference at Bludan in Syria, but Maulud Mukhlis (personalities No. 48) arrived three days ago and was received by the Prime Minister with every mark of friendship. Jamil Madfai told me on September 7th, i.e. the day after Maulud 1 s return, that things were now settling down so well in the Ministry of Defence that he began to contemplate handing it over to some person of proved experience. Maulud, if not Nuri, may have been in his mind. I understand that King Ghazi, who is in a highly nervous state as a result of the dislike felt for him by Nuri, has made one attempt at propitiation by sending Nuri a telegram of congratulation on the birth of his first grandson which occurred recently. 4. The Assistant Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior informs me that an enquiry is being held into the circumstances of Jafar al Askeri's death; but I do not know whether the results will be published or whether any action will be taken to punish the murderers. The press publishes extracts from an interview given to a Syrian newspaper by Ismail Tohalla, a former Aide-de-Camp to Bekr Sidki, who is popularly supposed to have done the deed. I enclose a translation/translation of one of these extracts from which it will he seen that Tohalla, while admitting the responsibility of his chief, denies that he himself played any part in the crime. The only appropriate comment would seem to he; 'Qui s f excuse s’accuse' . Incidentally, two of this morning’s papers announce that Jafar's hody, of which the burial place was unknown, had been discovered after diligent search and is being brought to Bagdad for burial in the Royal Cemetery at the side of the late King Faisal. 5 . On the fourth anniversary of his Accession, King Ghazi made his first broadcast address to his people. The speech contained little of note, but His Majesty expressed appreciation of the spirit of loyal attachment to the Throne of which his people had given proof 'on many occasions and notably at various times of emergency’’. He added an expression of his confidence in the new national government. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Oswald Scott.ENCLOSURE IN BAGDAD DESPATCH NO. 375 OP 9.9.37. Extract from interview with Ismail Tohalla. Questioned regarding the murder of Sayid Jafar al-Askari, Rais Tohall replied: ’’When the Army carried out the coup d’etat I was General Bekir Sidqi’s aide-de-camp. Jafar al-Askari came to the Army Headquarters, where he met several officers and showed them H.M. King Ghazi’s letter. General Bekir Sidqi heard of Jafar al-Askari’s activities which he considered a great danger to the new movement, and when Jafar later came to visit General Bekir Sidqi the latter ordered his officers to kill him. Sayid Jafar was then removed by car to a place some distance away where he was killed and immediately buried.” Rais Tohalla added that he had nothing to do with the murder, but he knew that owing to his connection with General Bekir Sidqi many people thought that he was responsible for the death of Sayid Jafar al-Askari.if THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 6FffllS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT the death of General Bekr Sidki and Major Muhammad All Jawad. 2. On the evening of the 10th August, General Bekr Sidki left for Mosul by train en route for Turkey, where he was to attend the autumn manoeuvres. For some unknown reason, although Mosul was full of his enemies, Bekr Sidki had elected to spend over twenty-four hours there. Like Caesar before the Ides of March, Bekr Sidki is said to have received numerous warnings, chiefly from women, but he seems to have entered full of confidence on the fatal 11th August, which, strange to say, was the fourth anniversary of the day on which, by his direct orders, over 300 Assyrians were done to death in the village of Simel. 3. On the morning of the 11th August, Muhammad Ali Jawad, the Officer Commanding the Royal Iraqi Air Force, flew up to Mosul and joined Bekr Sidki. who eventually accompanied him to the Air Officers’ Mess inside the aerodrome for luncheon and a siesta. It seems clear that the late Chief of the General Staff placed implicit trust in the air force, although they proved, in fact, the prime movers in the plot against his life. 4. At about five o’clock, while Bekr Sidki and Ali Jawad were still at rest in the rooms allotted to them, a Flight Commander was observed to leave the officers’ mess in a Ford car and drive towards the army lines nearby. There he picked up a corporal and a private who were awaiting him. With these two men he returned to the officers’ mess and himself remained at the wheel, while the two entered the enclosed courtyard of the mess, which contained a central lawn wher e seats and tables were set out in the shade. The corporal took up his stand m the verandah overlooking the lawn, while the private, who was apparently there to identify the general for his companion, placed himself in the doorwav nearby. At about 5-30, when it was beginning to get cool, Bekr Sidki came from his room and, crossing the verandah, sank into one of the seats on the lawn without noticing the two figures lurking in the background. A few minutes later Ah Jawad emerged from his room, and, observing the corporal hanging about in the verandah, asked him peremptorily what he was doing there. For all answei the coipoial, urged on by the private in his doorway, drew a Browning revolver, advanced on Bekr Sidki and, as the general half turned in his chair, shot him through the head. He was killed instantaneously. Ali Jawad rushed at the assassin, only to fall dead in his turn with a bullet through the chest. The corporal then emptied the remaining shots into the general’s dead body. 5. At the sound of the shots several officers rushed out of their rooms and the assailant was seized and placed under arrest. The private escaped for a time, and the officer outside the mess drove away. Those last two were subsequently apprehended. Neither they nor the corporal were sent to Bagdad. The latter is now stated to have been a relative of the late Dhia Yunis, who was murdered last January at the instigation of Bekr Sidki (see Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s despatch No. 70 of the 14th February). 6. As soon as the crime was reported to military headquarters at Mosul a cordon was drawn round the camp and the military assumed control of the town, t he bodies were taken to the Military Hospital, whence they were transferred bv air to Bagdad early next morning, aiid Hikmat Sulaiman was informed curtlv bv telephone of what had occurred. J 7. The funeral took place at the capital at 9-30 on the 12th August with imposing military ceremonial; and most citizens first heard of the murder when they saw the troops lining the streets and enquired the cause. I had mvself been EASTERN (Iraq). t- August 30, 1937. I .. ~7 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 . [E 5071/14/93] Copy No. 1 3 3 Mr. Scott to Mr. Eden.—(Received August 30.) (No. 342.) Sir, Bagdad, August 18, 1937. WITH reference to my telegram No. 188 of the 12th August, it may perhaps u p re f eren ce to my telegram No. 188 of the 12th August, it may perhaps be of interest to have an outline of the events which accompanied and followed [80 gg—1]informed at an early hour by the acting doyen of the Diplomatic Corps of what had occurred and was present with my diplomatic colleagues at the funeral, which was also, of course, attended by the members of the Cabinet and all the civil and military notabilities of Bagdad. 8. No details regarding the crime appeared in the Bagdad press. The newspapers of the 12th August merely reproduced a brief Government flb communique, announcing, “ with regret,” that the two officers had been murdered at Mosul by a soldier; and those of the 13th, while printing obituary notices, did not, with the exception of Bekr Sidki’s own organ, Al Difa, which has since ceased publication, express any admiration for the deceased officers or any regret at their death. Messages of condolence were received by the Government from members of the Persian and Turkish Governments. 9. It was at once realised by Hikmat Sulaiman and his colleagues that the murder had been no isolated act of revenge, but the outcome of a conspiracy against Bekr Sidki’s life. The organiser of the crime is understood to have been Captain Hindi of the Royal Iraqi Air Force, who probably acted with the tacit approval of the military commander at Mosul, General Amin-al-Umari, who proceeded to play an important, perhaps a decisive, part in the events of the next few days. As already stated, he had assumed control at Mosul immediately after the murder, and it soon became clear that his attitude was one of revolt against the Government. Thus he declined to obey the orders which reached him from Bagdad to send the persons arrested in connexion with the murder to the capital, refused to apprehend others whose arrest Hikmat Sulaiman demanded, and indicated that the Mosul garrison would resist by force any action taken by the Government to enforce their instructions. 10. Hikmat Sulaiman, in spite of the consternation which he must have felt at the death of the man to whom he owed his position as Prime Minister, does not appear to have realised at first the insecurity of his Government. He under estimated the hatred felt for the late general, and seems to have thought that only a minority of the army would support the Mosul garrison, and that, with the aid of a loyal majority, he would be able to remain in power and quell the revolt in the north. The Bagdad garrison were at first divided in sympathy, and Hikmat Sulaiman, with great courage, went personally to the citadel and harangued them, with some temporary effect. He also despatched troops to Mosul, with a view to enforce the Government’s will. In order to restore confidence he appointed Abdul Latif Nuri, a mild and inoffensive man, to succeed Bekr Sidki as Chief of the General Staff, and offered the Ministry of Defence to Jamil-al-Madfai. He also announced that the murderers would be brought to justice, and even, splendide menda.%, added that all rumours of disaffection were unfounded. 11. These efforts were, however, worse than useless. General Amin-al- Umari, who was coming to be regarded as the champion of the Arab element in the army, who had felt themselves slighted by Bekr Sidki, was still in complete control in the north and his influence was growing. On the 14th he issued a manifesto, of which I enclose a translation, justifying his attitude in refusing to obey the Government. At the same time, he had established communication with other commanders at Kirkuk and Bagdad, who received his overtures with sympathy; and a series of conditions appear to have been placed before Hikmat by the three garrisons, these including, it is said, demands for— (a) The banishment of all officers who supported the coup d'Etat-, (b) The return of the political exiles; (c) The removal of Bekr Sidki’s friends from high positions; (d) The formation of a military court, under the presidency of a close friend of Jafar Pasha, to investigate the events at Mosul; and (e) The passing of legislation forbidding participation in politics by army leaders. 12. On the 16th August Saiyid Jamal-al-Madfai arrived by air from Syria, and Hikmat Sulaiman, realising that the situation was beyond his control, tendered his resignation to the King and recommended that Madfai be asked to form a Government. Madfai’s return and the formation of his Cabinet is reported in a separate despatch. It is enough to mention here that when Hikmat Sulaiman resigned on the 16th August, General Amin-al-Umari handed back control to the Civil Governor at Mosul, and normal conditions were re-established throughout the country.370 3 13. It is too early perhaps to estimate the cause of the intense hatred felt for Bekr Sidki by the army. A member of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs explained it yesterday by saying that the Arabs have an ingrained hatred of anything resembling a military tyranny. It had been proved, he said, again and again, under the Turks that all attempts to rule Arabs by such means were bound •to end in disaster. Other reasons which may explain the hatred felt for Bekr Sidki were the favour shown by him to the Kurds, his pro-Turkish leanings, and the profligacy of his private life. 14. The general feeling throughout Iraq on the death of Bekr Sidki seems to have been one of relief. Hated and feared by nearly all, the general appears to have been loved by few. At any rate, no one has been heard to express a word of personal sorrow at his loss; even the German Minister, who was supposed to be one of his best friends, and who. it now appears, had for months been planning with the general an important deal in armaments, confined himself to the remark that Bekr Sidki had been an excellent soldier. The night after the murder, a house on the outskirts of Bagdad, usually dark and silent, was gaily illuminated; streams of people came in and out, and there were sounds of revelry and song. Mme. Jafar was celebrating the death of her husband’s murderer. I have, &amp;c. OSWALD SCOTT. . Enclosure. Manifesto to the People of Iraq. FOLLOWING on the murder of the late Bekr Sidki and Muhammad Ali Jawad, the necessary investigations were undertaken, and the murderer, together with those who instigated his action, were arrested. The scope of the investigations was at first confined to the actions of these persons. Subsequently, however, the Cabinet in Bagdad and other prejudiced circles demanded the arrest of a considerable number of officers who had nothing to do with the affair. Notwithstanding the advice tendered by us to the Cabinet not to exploit the murder as a means of obtaining revenge against innocent persons, they persisted in that course and demanded the despatch to Bagdad of a number of innocent officers as well as those persons who had already been placed under arrest. This demand led to a mutiny on the part of the army units here, who desired to save the lives of their innocent commanders and officers. Taking responsibility upon ourselves, we have withheld the despatch of the innocent officers and have severed our connexion with Bagdad. The inhabitants are called upon to preserve complete calm and to refrain from any act calculated to disturb public security. MUHAMMAD AMIN-AL-UMARI, Amir Liwa, District Commander, Mosul.- ^ 373 N «• Copy (S 5222/14/93) No. 353 . (l0C^70/37) 6164 7 British Embassy, Bagdad, 25th August, 1937, Sir, With reference to my despatch No, 349 of August 23rd, I have the honour to inform you that the Iraqi press of the 22nd August published an account of two telephonic conversations stated to have taken place on the 19th August between the new Prime Minister and representatives of two Cairo newspapers, ♦ »A1 Ahram' and ’’Al Masri' respectively. 2. The following are summaries of the two conversations in question: I. Asked by the M A1 Ah ram' representative about condi tions in Iraq following upon recent events, Jamil al Madfai is reported to have said that all was quiet. 'We went', he added, 'through a hurricane lasting a few hours after which the atmosphere cleared, and conditions returned to normal'. Asked what was the direct cause of the recent changes, the Prime Minister replied: 'The changes were natural, having regard to what had gone before. Those who know Iraq will understand this.' In the course of a long statement regarding the policy he intended to pursue, Jamil al Madfai said that he would follow the lines laid down by the late King Faisal and the men who co-operated with him in building up the State of Iraq. Among his objects he mentioned the final divorce of the army from politics. Foreign policy/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc.IW8K fr§) 3&gt;t policy, he added, would be based on collaboration with Eastern countries in general and Arab countries in particular; and, as in the time of King Faisal, Iraq, would maintain good relations of mutual confidence with her British Ally* In connexion with Palestine, the Prime Minister is reported to have spoken as follows: ’’Palestine is a part of Arabia and we cannot agree to its being detached therefrom# We shall make every effort to see that the rights of our Palestinian brethren are upheld.” He added that his government were sending a large delegation to Geneva to defend the cause of Palestine which was also that of all Arabs and Moslems, and he said that Iraq, would find many supporters. As regards the three tribal chiefs interned by the former Cabinet, he said that their case would be considered shortly. He also stated that Fawzi Kawokji had been released from his internment and would arrive in Bagdad on the following day. II. In reply to an enquiry from the representative of ”A1 Masri” as to the whereabouts of Hikmat Sulaiman, the Prime Minister denied that he had left for Turkey. ”He is a much respected man”, Jamil added, ”and no restrictions have been placed on his movements.” Asked whether Nuri as Said could return to Iraq, Jamil al Madfai answered ”Yes; at any time he likes.” 3. It is stated in the press that King Ghazi has received a telegram of congratulation on the formation of the new Cabinet from the Amir Abdullah, who describes Jamil al Madfai as ”a loyal champion of the Arab cause”. 4. The papers of the 23rd August announced that Brigadier- General Amin al Umari, the Military Commander at Mosul, had arrived in Bagdad. It had been generally expected that he would become Chief of the General Staff, but it is now officially announced/announced that General Husain Pauzi (Personalities No. 30) has 'been appointed to this position. In view of the prominent part played by Amin al Umari in recent events, the above decision is one to be welcomed and may be taken as an earnest of Jamil Madfai's sincerity in wishing to keep the Army out of politics. Husain Fauzi was to have accompanied Bekr Sidki to the Turkish manoeuvres and, on the latter's murder, took charge of the Iraqi military delegation which attended the manoeuvres. 5. Apart from the allusion in Jamil al Madfai's remarks reported above, nothing has been said since the new government came into power of any steps being taken to punish those responsible for the recent murders. The mother of the late Dhia Yunis is however stated to have petitioned the government to make investigations into the murder of her son (see Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's despatch No. 70 of February 14th), which is generally believed to have been carried out at Bekr Sidki*s instigation. 6 . It is announced that the former Minister of Defence, Abdul Latif Nuri, whom Hikmat Sulaiman had appointed Chief of the General Staff, has been placed on the retired list and that Fawzi Kawokji, who is described by ’'Al Bilad” 'as the famous Arab warrior', duly arrived in Bagdad and is staying in the house of a friend, a Syrian nationalist doctor called Amin Ruwaiha. 7.

N——— (10 3/69/37) r ■•T' • f —J 6162 British Embassy ,^ ? Bagdad, 23rd August, 1937 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that to-day I was received for the first time by the Prime Minister, Jamil al Madfai. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was present and acted as interpreter. 2. I congratulated the Prime Minister on the warmth of the reception accorded to him and his government, both by the people and in the press. Having thanked me for my congratulations and good wishes, Jamil Madfai assured me that it was his intention to maintain the most cordial relations with His Majesty’s Government, with whom Iraq was already so closely associated. 3. A reference to his acquaintanceship with General Bruce Hay, and their respective efforts to learn each other’s language, gave me an opportunity to say that when General Watson returned from his convalescence in Palestine the Prime Minister, I felt sure, would find in him a nan determined to co-operate with him in the fullest measure in all the problems relating to the further development of the efficiency of the Iraqi Army. I should not forget, I added, the impression made upon me by the fine bearing of the troops at the review held in honour of the Amir Saud; the advance achieved in twenty years had been striking and I had felt proud at the thought that the British Army and British Military Missions » had/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc, , etc., etc.had had some part in achieving those results. Should any differences of opinion arise - the task of adviser and critic was admittedly not an easy one - the Prime Minister could count on the good offices of His i,iajesty's Embassy to do their best to smooth out the difficulty. 4. The Prime Minister then touched upon the question of armaments saying that though the late gouvernrnent had been compelled to acquire in other countries certain equipment which His Majesty’s Government could not supply, he hoped that all future requirements could be met from the United Pingdom. I replied, laughingly, that the Prime Minister was getting on to rather delicate ground; that there had been cases in which perfectly serviceable equipment had been rejected because it was not brand new and that this had appeared to us to be more a pretext than a reason for placing the order in a foreign country; that by limiting their orders to the United } ingdom the Iraqi Government could rest assured that they would never receive an unserviceable weapon and could feel certain that for every £100,000 spent they were receiving £100,000 worth of equipment. 5. The conversation then drifted to Palestine, the x^rime Minister saying that he had no wish and no intention that differences of opinion as to the future of that Country should be allowed to prejudice our good relations. At the same time he would not conceal the fact that he was deeply interested in seeing that the Arabs in that country secured fair treatment. That, I said, was our interest too and it was oecause we tried so hard to be impartial that an equal number of stones were thrown at His Majesty’s Government by both/both parties. He suggested that we should leave the parties to throw stones at each other. This, I countered, would never do for three Arabs would be stoning one Jew, and His Majesty’s Government had always been disposed to help the weaker side. One day perhaps the Arabs and Jews in Palestine would be as wise and as unaggressive respectively as the Arabs and Jews in Bagdad, but for the present there was, I feared, little hope of our being able to allow them to compose their differences unaided. 6. It will be interesting to see whether the Prime Minister’s action give substance to the frank cordiality which prevailed throughout our interview.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No« 345 of August 18th regarding the formation of the Jamil Ivladfai Cabinet, I have the honour to report that the new Prime Minister, in the course of a short speech which he delivered at the installation ceremony, said that he would make every effort to ensure the conduct of affairs in accordance with the Constitution and v/ould restore political life to its normal channels* 2. The new Cabinet has been well received by the press. , A1 Istiqlal 1 said that the stability promised by Jamil Kadfai was what Iraq most needed after the series of violent crises through which she had recently passed; while ’A1 Zaman , quoted with approval a courageous utterance said to have been made by the new Prime Minister to the Senate a few weeks ago to the effect that the Army should not meddle in politics* 3* In connexion with the announcement that Itfuri Pasha has sent a message of congratulation to Jamil Kadfai, T A1 Istiqlal* refers with approval to the restraint which he has shewn since his 'tragic departure' proving thereby the nobility of his character and winning the admiration of the Iraqis who are now anxious once more to hear his voice in politics* In a subsequent article in the same newspaper/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C*, M.P., etc*, etc*, etc*newspaper, Nuri and his companions in exile are referred to as 'our Liberal leaders”• Time, says the paper, has not affected Iraq 1 s feelings of loyalty towards these men, although circumstances may have prevented its free expression and, now that conditions have returned to normal and the reins of government are once more in the hands of n our brethren in race” (an allusion to Hikmat Suleiman*s Turco- Kurdish connections), it is in the x^Llic interest that they should return to Iraq. 4. It is stated that, in addition to the message from Nuri Pasha mentioned above, telegrams of congratulation have been received by the Prime Minister from inter alios . the Amir of Transjordan, the Higher Arab Committee, the Prime Minister of Syria, and Rashid Ali al Gailani (Minister of the Interior under the last Yasin Government). 5. There have been but few comments on the departed Cabinet, out *A1 Istiqlal* says that on account of their praiseworthy attitude in regard to Palestine, and their measures against communist propaganda, it does not grudge them a sincere Godspeed.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4112/14/93] July 19. 1937. Section 1 . Copy No. 121 Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received July 19.) (No. 274.) Bagdad, July 3, 1937. THE political crisis upon which I have had the honour to report to you in some recent telegrams is now past, and Hikmat Sulaiman has begun again with a set of five new Ministers, Naji-al-Asil and General Abdul Latif Nuri being the only two who have remained at their posts. 2. The resignation of his four colleagues was a heavy buffet to the Prime Minister. He seems to have had no idea that Jafar Abu Timmun was out of sympathy with him. and although he knew that Salih Jabr and Kamil Chadirchi had been restless for some time, the concerted revolt of four members of his Cabinet took him wholly by surprise. He was actually in the Embassy talking to me confidently of the future of his Government when the blow fell. 3. It seems that the Minister of Finance, who had been put out of temper by opposition in Parliament to his Income Tax Bill, was shocked by reports of the heavy losses of his fellow Shiahs in the tribal attack on Samawa, and by exaggerated stories of the severities of the Mutessarif of Diwaniyah (see my telegram No. 123). He acted in a hot gush of indignation, and is now. I am told, repenting his haste in the quiet of retirement. Kamil Chadirchi joined him because he foresaw that in any case he would soon be turned out of office. Yusuf Iz-al-Din followed Kamil as a loyal friend, and Salih Jabr was perhaps really glad to withdraw in good company from a position in which he had never been happy. 4. It was Jafar and Kamil who led the revolt, hoping, I gather, by a remonstrance against the spilling of blood, to win a large measure of popular support. What they did was to distribute widely in the Holy Cities and on the Euphrates copies of their letter of resignation, in which they accused the Prime Minister of unwarranted harshness in dealing with the troubles in Diwaniyah, and declared that they were unable any longer to be associated with such tyranny. 5. Hikmat Sulaiman did not much mind the loss of Kamil Chadirchi, Yusuf Iz-al-Din or Salih Jabr. For many reasons, however, including a real personal affection for Jafar Abu Timmun. the Prime Minister wanted to keep his Minister of Finance. But the distribution of the letter of resignation made a wide breach, and his efforts to bridge it had to be given up when it was discovered that Jafar and Kamil had made a determined attempt to provoke a general strike in the capital the day after their resignation. This attempt, which happily failed, made reconciliation clearly impossible. 6. The Prime Minister then asked Naji Shaukat (who had come from Angora with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs), Jamil Madfai and Nasiat-al-Farisi to join him. l^&amp;ji Shaukat has told me that all three would have agreed to do so if the Prime Minister had been willing to put Jamil Madfai into the Ministry of Defence. He explained that they had been impressed by what they had heard of the interference of the Chief of the General Staff in matters of policy outside his proper sphere, and that they felt unable to enter the Cabinet unless a check were placed upon him. They had thought that this would best be done if Jamil Madfai became Minister of Defence. According to Naji Shaukat, the Prime Minister said that he could not assent to this suggestion bee arise it would mean disloyalty to General Abdul Latif Nuri, who was now on sick leave in Europe. But Naji Shaukat maintained that the real reason was that Bekr Sidqi had threatened to resign if this plan were put into effect. 7. lam inclined to think that Naji Shaukat was right, but I find it difficult to guess what, beyond common gossip, led him and the others to think it essential to put a check upon Bekr Sidqi. The Minister for Foreign Affairs in discussing [55 t—1]2 recent events, assured me, with every appearance of sincerity, that the current stories of Bekr Sidqi's interference in matters which were not his concern were unfounded. He said that since the Government had come into office the Chief of the General Staff had not once attempted to impose his will upon the Ministers. Naji Shaukat, on the other hand, told me that he was satisfied that Bekr Sidqi’s influence upon policy was greater than that of the Prime Minister himself. Possibly these two appreciations are not so conflicting as they seem at first to be. The truth may be that Bekr Sidqi uses his influence by stealth. In any case, there is little doubt that he was strong enough to upset the plan made by Naji Shaukat and Jamil Madfai to curb him. You will remember that it has always been his claim that his only interest dwelt in the Iraqi army. Some justification for this is perhaps to be found in a story which I had from Dr. Bu§tii Aras, who in his turn had it from the King of Iraq. When Hikmat Sulaiman was trying to form his new Cabinet, King Ghazi let it be known to Bekr Sidqi that he would be willing to accept him as Prime Minister. Bekr Sidqi excused himself on the plea that he was both happy and fully occupied in his present post. 8. When the Prime Minister failed to persuade the three men of his choice to join him. he had to give up the idea of a Cabinet of personages, and to fall back upon men of second rank. In such a position it was perhaps wise to choose in the main experienced officials rather than untried politicians. And though, as Lf 3 I reported in my telegram No. 1 29, the new team are unimpressive and offer little prospect of permanence, they may do well enough until some men of greater weight can be persuaded to replace them. The inclusion of Mustafa-al-Umari has certainly brought valuable administrative experience to a department where it is much needed, after seven months of Hikmat Sulaiman’s fitful and wayward control. 9. As it now stands, the Cabinet consists of— Prime Minister : Hikmat Sulaiman. Interior : Mustafa-al-Umari. Finance : Mohamad Ali Mahmud. Foreign Affairs : Naji-al-Asil. Economics and Communications : Abbas Mahdi. Justice : Ali Mahmud-al-Sheikh Ali. Defence : Abdul Latif Nuri. Education : Jafar Hamandi. The newcomers are, with the exception of the Minister of Justice, dependable if undistinguished men, and Ali Mahmud-al-Sheikh Ali, though in the past an extreme and often violent nationalist, has, I am told, mellowed with time, and, like so many others, he may be tamed by office. His British colleagues in the Ministry speak well of his natural ability. 10. It is not easy to assess the effect upon the public mind of the events which I have related. There is naturally some fear lest the tribes on the Euphrates may be heartened by the resignation of the four Ministers ostensibly on their account, but it is too early to say. For the present, all ground movements in Rumaitha and Samawa, the worst danger points, seem to be over, and the aircraft which have been operating there have been withdrawn. The new Minister of the Interior may be able to prescribe a fresh treatment for the chronic disorders of Diwaniyah, and I think the Prime Minister will be willing enough to let him try. In Bagdad, I gather, Jafar Abu Timmun has lost rather than gained in reputation by the manner of his resignation, and there are few who regret the departure of Kamil Chadirchi. They and their two colleagues have had a bad press, and have been much blamed for trying to embarrass the Prime Minister during the visit of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. What forces they may be able to gather if they care to go into active opposition it is hard as yet to say. 11. ^ I saw three of them at an evening party the day after their resignation, and I found them well pleased with themselves and cherishing the mistaken belief that public opinion would be with them. Each one had his own slant in his criticism of Hikmat Sulaiman. but all were agreed that the Prime Minister was in the hands of the Chief of the General Staff, and all declared that this was intolerable. None seemed to care who knew that such was his opinion.12. It is not unnatural that I should at all times be alert for signs of the waning of Bekr Sidqi’s strength, which lies mainly in the fear that is felt of him, and I like to see the beginnings of such signs in this—that these three men should make no secret of their dislike of his influence upon the affairs of the country, and that three more, Naji Shaukat, Jamil Madfai and Nasrat-al-Farisi, should let it be known that they refrained from taking office on its account. Some months ago such open dissent might well have seemed to mean at best a holiday abroad or at worst a bullet in the back. That it can be expressed to-day with impunity is, to my mind, both interesting and significant. At the same time, I have heard of late of a good deal of discontent in the army with the rule of Bekr Sidqi, and this might become dangerous if a rival leader were found. Brigadier Husain Fauzi, the officer commanding the Bagdad district (who took no part in the coup d’ fitat), is one of the influential officers who are said to be out of accord with the Chief of the General Staff. 13. In the north and in Basra, although there has been much gossip, little real interest seems to have been taken in the Cabinet crisis. 14. At the last sitting of the Chamber before Parliament rose for the summer recess, the Prime Minister made a significant speech about the resigna tion of his four colleagues. He said that his Government stood for patriotic nationalism, and was resolutely opposed to all destructive social ideas. They were determined to govern in accordance with democratic principles and to resist all attempts to destroy the Constitution. From the nation as a whole they demanded, first and foremost, peace and tranquillity, and they would not hesitate to punish those who sought to disturb public order. He left it to history to judge whether the Ministers who had resigned had acted rightly, but, as the one most responsible for the security of the country, he was at all times prepared to do what was necessary to discharge this responsibility, and he would watch attentively how these resigning Ministers behaved. 15.

CONFIDENTIAL July 5, 1937. Section 1. Copy No. j j (No. 237.) Sir, Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received July 5.) Bagdad, June 12, 1937. IT is now some six months since the events of the 29th October brought Hikmat Sulaiman to power and the time has come to attempt an estimate of the present position of his Government. 2. A few days ago I had a talk with him and I put to him some questions wliich had been in my mind for some little time. He professed to be in good cafe and more than at ease about the present state of things in the country. He claimed that by his timely arrest of three of four of the most troublesome sheikhs on the Euphrates he had gone a long way to bring quiet to a district were disquiet was endemic and, although we had given him no guns with which to make a show and no shells for the few he had, he had managed to impose his authority where the Government’s writ had long ceased to run. In doing so he had gathered much strength. Indeed, he now felt so strong that he believed that, if he would, he could smash the clan system for good and all. He could break the power of the tribal chiefs which had been the source of so much embarrassment to his pre decessors. He could split up the large estates from which they drew that power and distribute the land amongst the tribesmen. He would not flinch from doing his country so precious a service if only the administrative machine were fit to take over the fresh burden that would be thrown upon it. Unhappily he could not say that is was. He must therefore hold his hand and make it his business to forge the instrument that was needed. So much for the Euphrates, where trouble had always lain in the past. As for the north, it was quiet and he had in mind a far-reaching plan to make it quieter still. 3. Parliament was giving him but little trouble, akhough he was bound to confess that now and then a few of its members were a nuisance with their talk of communism in Iraq. He had had recently to call them somewhat roughly to order. They were now in hand. As I well knew, the charge that his Government were susceptible to Communist influences was fantastic. All that he wanted to do was to better the lot of the poor and to give land to landless peasants. He was not going to let a handful of well-to-do Members of Parliament turn him from his purpose. 4. Outside Parliament the Opposition was equally slight. Who was left but Jamil-al-Madfai and the two Suwaidis ? Jamil, he thought, was now friendly enough and content to be the figure-head of the pan-Arab movement and to sun himself in the applause that had been given him since his homecoming from the Yemen. The Suwaidis were, it was true, disgruntled and might well turn nasty. But, if they did, it would be easy to put them away by showing up their long history of corruption and peculation. On such an issue he would be sure to carry public opinion with him. 5. On the whole his Cabinet had worked well enough, but when Parliament rose he would probably make a few changes. He meant to split the Ministry of Economics and Communications into two and to find someone to take over his own portfolio of the Interior. Whatever rumour might suggest to the contrary he was working in harmony with the Chief of the General Staff, who was in full sympathy with the policy that he was trying to pursue. But here again his task would have been much eased if circumstances had not prevented His Majesty’s Government from letting him have the arms for which he had begged so earnestly. 6. I see no reason to contest Hikmat Sulaiman’s claim to gathered strength. It cannot be denied that his bold stroke on the Euphrates has compelled ^the respect of those (and they were not a few) who had begun to see in his policy of gentleness and suasion a weakness which no Iraqi Prime Minister can long afford to suggest. Indeed, his unexpected show of force seems everywhere to have restored the flagging confidence in the Government’s ability to' rule. At the same time I am disposed to doubt that he is yet strong enough to break the clan [55 e—1]2 system and I think that it is perhaps as well that at present circumstances deter him from making an attempt to do so. The process of averting an outbreak on the Euphrates has not been entirely bloodless, for there has been some resistance on the part of the Samawa tribesmen to the building of blockhouses in their country. This has ended in some bombing from the air and in some slight ground operations by the police. 7. Hikmat Sulaiman has probably measured aright his hold over Parlia- • ment and the weakness of the forces arrayed against him outside it. Jamil-al- Madfai is at first glance the only man in civil life in Iraq who might take Hikmat Sulaiman’s place, but he does not seem at present to wish to play any part in politics. The day may, however, come when his support of the pan-Arab cause may make him the natural successor of a man who had held the movement at an arm’s length. I have in mind the possibility of fresh trouble in Palestine, when Hikmat Sulaiman may perhaps find it distasteful either to lend himself to the emotions that it would provoke here or to take steps to check them. As for the Suwaidi brothers, as time goes on they tend, I am glad to say, to become more and more fly-blown and discredited. It is no unhappy thing to see these two hardbitten old knaves dropping into the background. Better still if they were brought to justice. 8. But the opposition to Hikmat Sulaiman does not end there. As was to be foreseen, his programme in itself did much to disturb those (landowners, merchants and the like) who saw in it a possible threat to property. These may be said to represent a not unformidable body of opinion which, although now quiescent, would be ready enough to rally to anyone who seemed likely to shake the position of the Prime Minister. To them should be added the men who were driven from lucrative posts when he first came to power. 9. With the general public, I should say, Hikmat Sulaiman still stands well. The first fine glow of brotherhood that warmed the hearts of the wayward and fickle Iraqis on his coming into office is long since spent. So much was to be done and so quickly and yet there is little or nothing to show. There is no denying that many feel disillusioned. Nevertheless there is, I think, a wide, deep belief in the integrity of the Prime Minister which stands him in good stead and may in itself prove lo be enough to carry him over the months that must still pass before the first effects of his policy are to be seen. This is, I think, the secret of his strength and for this reason much, if not all, depends upon him himself—a lonely figure, bearing on his shoulders not only the whole burden of the country’s affairs, but also what appears to many to be an old man of the sea in the shape of the Chief of the General Staff. 10. Whatever he may say about it, with his Cabinet Hikmat Sulaiman has had no easy time. At best they were a scratch lot, mustered in haste. But he has shown skill in handling them and in bringing their divergent and often conflicting aims into line. With his Minister for Foreign Affairs he has been, I should say, content enough, for Naji-al-Asil has shown more than adequate wisdom and judgment in the conduct of his department. The main weakness has lain with the Ministers of Finance(') and EconomicsQ. While with time Jafar-abu-Timan has tended to mellow, to find more balance and to turn a readier ear to the voice of his adviser, Kamil Chadirchi has, in his turn, been more and more out of tune with his colleagues and has made several efforts to resign. The Minister of Justice,^) too, has tried more than once to scuttle back to the mutessarifiya of Kerbela and Najaf, where he left his heart when he joined Hikmat Sulaiman last October. But he and the rest are of no particular shape and certainly of no account. The Cabinet indeed would have much to gain by some changes, but it is hard to see where the Prime Minister can turn for men who will bring him the support and the strength he lacks. For the Interior he has his eye on Naji Shaukat,( 2 ) who has held that office more than once. It is to be hoped that he will succeed in persuading Naji Shaukat to leave his post at Angora, for his presence in the Cabinet would give it some of the body it now needs. For Economics or Communications his choice has fallen upon Mohammed-el-Hadid, a notable from Mosul, who is a Member of Parlia- ment( 3 ). f 1 ) (These Ministers have since resigned.—Eastern Department note.) ( 2 ) Iraqi Personalities, No. 64. (He has not in fact entered the new Cabinet.—Eastern Department note.) ( 3 ) He was returned at the last general election. Before then he was a senior official in the Ministry of Finance. (He has not in fact entered the new Cabinet.—Eastern Department note.)■m T'; 4&lt;3 3 11. For some time past it has been said that few of the Ministers share the confidence that the Prime Minister professes to repose in the Chief of the General Staff. Notably the Minister of Finance, who is seldom on good terms with Bekr Sidqi and is believed, in common with some of his colleagues, to reproach the Prime Minister with being blinded by the general’s show of discre tion into a mistaken belief in his loyalty. There can be no question about the discretion of Bekr Sidqi. All that he has said and done until now gives force to his assertion that his only interest lies in the Iraqi army. His public utter ances have been few and have been marked by a disarming modesty which may be genuine or may be designed to catch the popular fancy. It would not be unnatural in a man of his kind to wish to be liked as well as feared. And if he has meant to ingratiate himself, he has not been unsuccessful, for a number of Members of Parliament, notables and tribal chiefs have tried to group them selves about him. So far, however, in public at any rate, he has given them no encouragement. The truth is that he remains an enigma and probably, when having him in mind, it is safest to assume that his ambitions are what they seemed to be when he brought about the coup cT Etat, and that, when he conceives that the time has come, he will try to make himself the head of the State. 12. There is another factor in the situation which cannot be ignored. I refer to the King of Iraq. The disappearance of Yasin was clearly a relief to him, and the slackening of the fetters which the late Prime Minister had put upon him left His Majesty some freedom to indulge his own caprices. To these Hikmat Sulaiman has so far shut a prudent eye and the relations of the two men have been untroubled. But it has been whispered of late, with a persist ence that cannot be disregarded, that King Ghazi is becoming suspicious of both his Prime Minister and Bekr Sidqi and that he is in touch with Nuri-al- Said. It is not improbable that he may have inherited King Feisal’s instinctive fear of the emergence of a strong Government which would make the monarchy superfluous, and that he may be looking to Nuri as the man to thwart the present Cabinet’s bid for long life and stability. 13. It will be seen from the above that, although Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government are faced with many problems which they may find it difficult to overcome, their position is at bottom no weaker than that of most of their pre decessors and that they enjoy the uncommon advantage of widespread trust in the honesty of their purpose.

In this connexion it is appropriate to report that, a few days ago, a group of deputies put forward in parliament a resolution that, in recognition of his great services to the country, the government should set up a statue to General Bekr Sidqi and present him with a new house. The General asked the Prime Minister to explain that credit for the national movement of October 29th belonged to the whole army and not to him alone, and that those who desired to perpetuate the memory of that great day should realise that the beat gift to the army was arms. The deputies should there fore think of increasing the money voted for the fighting forces rather than of putting up statues to their leaders.

Shaikh Abdul fahid, made a state ment on reeent events in the blwaaiy&amp;h province. 2. He said that on coming into office his government had considered it to be one of their first and most impor tant duties to improve the general conditions of this province, which had suffered so much from the disorders of the summer of 1936. They had striven not only to restore peace and order but also to revive prosperity. Their first act had been to issue a general amnesty for all political offenders and then to order the restoration of all immovable property confiscated during the disturb ances of laat year. After this the government had spent more than fISO,000 on public works which had given employ ment to about 10,000 men. In addition they had opened a number of now schools and health institutions. . 3. nevertheless the government had proof that, in conspiracy with others, the two senators and the deputy named, had distributed over 3,000 rifles among the tribesmei ofSafe-- (Cm&gt;) of this provine® during the iaat eix month© and hud incited the tribe© to ri®« s;gainat the authority of the government. It was the first and foremost duty of the government to maintain order and he therefore asked the Chamber to give them the authority which they required to deal fittingly with those who were threatening to disturb the peace of the realm. 4. ^he Prime Minister made a similar statement in the Senate, and in both chambers the resolution was passed without opposition. 6 . The three men in question were thereupon removed separately to Kirkuk, Mosul and Arbil, where they are being kept under surveillance. The Prime Minister toid me that he intends to try them in the criminal courts, but he may find it more convenient to deal with them under the Tribal Criminal and Civil disputes xiegulatlons. In Diw&amp;niyah itself a number of other preventive arrests have already been made under this law.« 6 . Up to the present the results of the govern ment's action have been good. No disturbances have broken out and the authority and prestige of the government have been enhanced. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant , 'Sgd.)

So far as can be seen at present the authority of the Government has been strengthened and confidence restored in their ability to rule. The Mutasarrif of Diwaniyah, v/ho is now in Bagdad, reports that the situation in that province is much improved and recommends that the occasion should be taken to dispose oi the outstanding land disputes which the three sheikhs were exploiting in order to embarrass the Government. It seems that sheikhs were first oifered restricted liberty against a security of £7,000 and 5,000 rifles for their good behaviour and that when it proved that they were unable to give trie required security they were sentenced, under Tribal Regulations, to three years’ imprisonment. onanshut, the rival oi Khawwam al Abbas, (see paragraphs 2 and 5 oi my despatch Fo. 127 or the 51st of March) has been similarly dealt with and the Government may now be able to give eiiect to their wish to restore to Khawwam the lands confiscated by the Yasin government in 1955.

This young officer belongs to an undistinguished middle-class Bagdad family, but hie sisters have been close friends of the orincese from childhood. 2. In some quarters, especially, I am told, among the tribes, the orineeaa’s marriage to a commoner has been talked of as yet another disgrace for the T oyel ’’amily; in others, particularly among the younger generation in the towns, it is regarded as showing a commendable democratic solrit in the Palace. 6 . The ^rime Unieter himself was at one time opposed to the match, but, when he learned that the affections of the princess were deeply engaged, he gave way, fearing that she might be driven to desperation if permission for the marriage was refused. In this I think he van right, for it is certainly better that the princess should be married decently, even to a young man of no great social position, that that she should be left to take matters into her own hands and oerhaos to follow the example of her elder sister’s elopement last year.

Vj j COPY (E 1967/14/93) * No. 127» (100/27/37) j British Enihassy, Bagdad. 31st March, 1937 Sir, The brief reference made in my telegrams Nos. 50 and 51 of March 22nd to the Prime Minister’s anxiety concerning the situation in the Diwaniyah province probably calls for some slight elaboration. 2. For this purpose a general background may best be provided by the memorandum prepared by Mr. Edmonds for the enlightenment of Yasin al Hashimi in June 1936 (a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No.277 of June 4th last). What stands out most sharply from this background is the banishment of Shaikh Khawwam al Abbas of the Bani Zuraij in 1935, the confiscation of all his immovable property and the transfer of the greater part of it to his rival Shanshui, and the efforts of Khawwam 1 s son, Mahmud, to recover this property, which brought about the disturbances at Rumaitha in April and May of last year. 3. And now on top of this has come the pardoning of Khawwam soon after the change of government last October. Khawwam is at present in Bagdad and the government have been doing their best, by means of tribal arbitration, to secure the peaceful restoration to him of the property handed over to Shanshui by the Yasin government. But Shanshui refuses to give up the land and the old trouble-makers, Abdul Wahid and Saiyid Muhsin abu Tabikh, are encouraging him to be obstinate. In these circumstances the tribal elements opposed to Abdul Wahid and Saiyid Muhsin have tried to keep the balance of power in Diwaniyah by rallying round Khawwam, and/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, K.C., M.P., etc. , etc. , etc.‘tsr and once more the hukomis and the mutamarrids (the law- abiding and the turbulent) are gathering in opposing factions. 4. This is the main feature of the present situation, but it is not the Prime Minister 1 s only difficulty. A host of minor shaikhs and tribal leaders are taking advantage of the weakness of the government’s authority in ohe Middle Euphrates to revive old disputes, to extort favours and to busy themselves with intrigue of every kind in the manner so characteristic of that part of the country. 5. The Prime Minister is working with resourcefulness and patience, but is not making the progress which his good intentions deserve. At first he was full of hope, but now he is beginning sadly to realise that, in dealing with these people, a sense of fairness is not enough and that firmness and authority are also necessary. That is why he is feeling so acutely the need of a stronger army. 6. It would serve no good purpose to point out to him that much of the new armament for which the army is asking, such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns and fighter aeroplanes, would be of no service in operations against the tribes. Ke is not the man to study detail and moreover those in control of the army want these things and are not to be gainsaid. Nor is he likely to listen to the argument that the forces already at his disposal are quite strong enough to deal with the Diwaniyah tribes. One of his chief charges against his predecessors is their shedding of Arab blood, and he is naturally in no hurry to resort to force himself to deal with the situation. He therefore goes on trying to bring about a peaceful settlement and hoping that before he exhausts his stock of palliative expedients the army will have been so strengthened as to frighten everyone into submission without his having to strike a blow. 7./Hix 7. It may be possible for some time to avert troubles by some such means as this, but it can produce no lasting solution, and I fear that sooner or later, whatever government may be in office, further military operations will be necessary on the Euphrates before atiy real progress may be made tov/ards the final pacification of this turbulent area. 8. If he ever stops to reflect upon the past, the Prime Minister must now bitterly regret the part he played in the disastrous intrigues of the early months of 1935 which brought the Euphrates tribes into the political arena. 9.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 83 o f the 23rd February, I have the honour to report that King Ghazi opened the new Parliament on the 27th February. 2. A translation of the Speech from the Throne, taken from the Iraq Times of the 1st March, is enclosed herein^ 1 ) After referring briefly to the events which had led to a change of Government, the dissolution of the last Parliament and to the steps which had been taken to restore tranquillity, King Ghazi spoke of Iraq’s relations with her neighbours. He mentioned with satisfaction the progress which was being made towards a settlement of the dispute with Persia and to the Government’s efforts to hasten the signature of the Four-Power Pact of Non-Aggression between Iraq, Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan. His Majesty then alluded to the Government’s plans for modernising the arms and equipment of the army. 3. The speech went on to summarise the Government’s economic programme, the extension of the railway to Mosul, the financing of capital works, and the distribution of State lands, and concluded with a reference to the schemes which had been prepared for the expansion of the principal public services, including education, health and justice. 4. After King Ghazi’s departure the Senate and the Chamber elected their presidents. In the Upper House, Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi was chosen, and in the Lower, Fakhri Jamil obtained 99 out of the 101 votes cast. 5. Muhammad Ridha-al-Shabibi is a Shiah with a reputation for learning, who was Minister for Education in the Cabinet formed by Yasin-al-Hashimi in March 1935, and Fakhri Jamil is the head of a wealthy Bagdad Sunni family, who for many years has played a continuous but minor part in public life. 6.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the general election finished on Saturday, the 20th February. 2. In all 115 candidates were elected to the Chamber, an increase of seven over the number returned at the last election in August 1935. Of these, two were added to the Muntafiq Province, two to Arbil, one to Hillah, and two to Diwaniyah. Thirty-four of those elected sat in the last Parliament, and of the balance about a third have been Deputies before. All the Ministers have found seats, and the principal organisers of the recently dissolved Popular Reform League (see my despatch No. 26 of the 13th January) have also been elected. Tribal interests are in general well represented, and in the troublesome Diwaniyah Province the Government have apparently held the balance carefully between the local factions.

ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR, [956 c—1]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 1057/14/93 Sir A. Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden. — {Received. February 20.) (No. 51.) Si rj Bagdad, January 30, 1937. THE death of Yasin-al-Hashimi has been the source of much embarrassment to the Iraqi Government. When Taha-al-Hashimi, who had been called to Beirut from Istanbul, asked the Iraqi Government for permission to bring his brother’s body to Bagdad for burial, the Prime Minister replied that there was no objection to the body being sent to Bagdad, but that it was not desirable that I aha himself should accompany it. . , . , 2. In some quarters, especially, I am told, in the army, Hikmat Sulaiman s action was much resented, and there were many who maintained that Yasin should not be buried in Iiaq at all. Others, however, supported the Prime Minister and felt strongly that Yasin could not decently be refused a grave in his own country. 3. Meanwhile, in Beirut and Damascus official honours were being given to Yasin’s body, and a delegation of public men and a detachment of the Iron Shirt organisation were chosen to go with it to Bagdad. But the Iraqi Govern ment. who had not been consulted, decided that, in view of the conflict of opinion in this country, the arrival of such a delegation would cause further undesirable complications. The Iraqi consul-general at Beirut was therefore instructed to make this decision known to the Syrian Government at Damascus, and to explain that suitable arrangements would be made to receive the coffin at the frontier and to convey it to Bagdad. The Government’s refusal to allow the Syrian delegations to come to Iraq deeply offended many of Yasin’s old friends, who were also dissatisfied with the arrangements which were being made to bury Yasin without public honours. Some of them even went so far as to talk of organising demonstra tions, and the Government, fearing a clash between these groups and the other elements which were opposed to any public tribute to Yasin’s memory, took the precaution of shutting up several of Yasin’s friends. Among these were Sadiq Bassam, the Minister for Education in Yasin’s last Cabinet, and Daud-al-Sadi, a well-known Nationalist lawyer who had for long been one of the late Prime Minister’s close friends. 4. At this stage, one of Yasin’s relations telegraphed from Bagdad to Taha in Damascus recommending that Yasin should be buried there, and the Syrians, who appear to have taken much amiss the Iraqi Government’s refusal to receive theii* delegation, welcomed this proposal and, as you already know, buried Yasin by the side of Saladin. 5. In many ways the burial of Yasin in Damascus relieved the tension in Bagdad, but the Iraqi Government have not come well out of the events which preceded it. By their imprisonment 'of those whose loyalty to an old friend had impelled them to urge that public honours should be given to him at his funeral, the Government have added not a few to the already dangerously large number of their enemies in Iraq and, by their treatment of the Syrians, they have provoked much criticism in the press of Cairo and Damascus. 6. It is unfortunate that the Government should have incurred this ill- feeling at a time when they are already faced with embarrassments enough. From the beginning the Prime Minister wanted to give Yasin an honourable funeral, but he could not ignore the risks involved in a public funeral procession, which would have been much enhanced if a deputation of Syrian notables had come to Bagdad for the occasion. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that, if the Government had handled the situation with greater tact, they might have avoided giving such widespread offence, and it will, I fear, be some time before the unhappy ghost of Yasin is laid. 7. It is perhaps fitting here to report that, a few days after Yasin’s death, Mohammed Zaki died in Bagdad of a disease of the liver from which be had [931 u—1] 1819 I February 20, 1937. 1957 j Section l - Copy No.long been suffering, lie was the President of the last Chamber of Deputies, and the coincidence of his death with that of Yasin, of whom he was an old and close friend, has given birth to the sinister joke that Izrael (the Mahometan Angel of Death) is a member of Hikmat's Cabinet. As though to make amends for the bungling of Yasin’s funeral, Mohammed Zaki was buried with full public honours, and a representative of King Ghazi and all the members of the Cabinet followed his coffin to the grave. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo, to His Majesty's consul-general at Beirut and to His Majesty’s consul at Damascus. 1 I ha ve, Ac. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTYjEULHX&amp;JEU&amp;XAN-N-IC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT f ~ mi i— 1 HAVE the honour to report that two incidents have occurred recently which I cannot but regard as disquieting. 2. On the evening of the 20th January, Dhia Yunis was assassinated in the street, close to his house in one of the near suburbs of Bagdad. The murdered man, who was a native of Mosul, had often been a Deputy, and had occupied the important post of secretary to the Cabinet during the latter part of Yasin-al- Hashimrs tenure of office. He was relieved of this post a few days after Hikmat Sulaiman’s Government came into power, and appointed to the drafting depart ment of the Ministry of Justice. The story of the murder is that two men drove up behind him in a motor car and shot him several times at close range and then decamped. The bullets found in the body were of a pattern which can only be used in the latest type of British service revolver, of which, I am told on good authority, only very few have so far been issued. This fact suggests that the murderers were probably Iraqi officers, who had obtained their weapons from the ordnance department, and it is significant that no steps, so far as I am aware, have been taken to follow up this clue and no arrests have been made. 3. It is difficult to say what motive there was for the crime, but it is commonly believed that Dhia Yunis had been in correspondence with Yasin-al- Hashimi and that he paid for this indiscretion with his life. 4. Public excitement over this affair had scarcely begun to subside when, on the night of the 9th February, a determined attempt was made to kill Maulud-al-Mukhlis, a Senator, whose exploits in the Arab revolt against the Turks have been related in the books of T. E. Lawrence. Here again circumstances pointed to political motives. A few days earlier Maulud, who is a heavy drinker, had come uninvited to a small party of friends and members of the Government and had abused them all for being a pack of miserable Bolsheviks and for having deserted the Arab cause, for which he had spilled his blood. An altercation and a scuffle had followed in which one of those present got a black eye. The story soon went round the town, but Dr. Naji, to whom I spoke about it, told me that Maulud had afterwards been very ashamed of himself and had apologised for his misbehaviour. A short time afterwards he seems, however, to have acted again in a similar manner, and a few days later five shots were fired at his motor car while it was passing through an unfrequented street at about 11 o’clock at night. Fortunately, neither Maulud nor his driver were hit. but the bullets left their marks on the car. 5. These two events, which suggest that the murder gang of the army is still active, have shocked the better elements of public opinion. 6. It would be useless to speculate about the extent to which the Chief of the General Staff is privy to these crimes, but it is hard to escape the conviction that he could put a stop to this terrorism if he wished to do so. In the general political life of the country, Bekr Sidqi appears of late to be taking a somewhat more active part than hitherto. There are signs that he is being friendly to the Kurds, who, as there is no Kurdish Minister in the Cabinet, are tending to resort to him when they come to Bagdad, and that his influence over the policy of the Cabinet is still strong. I have heard of a recent meeting of the Railway Board at which Bekr Sidqi brusquely overruled the objections of the Minister of Finance to a proposal made by Colonel Ward. It is only fair, however, to add that I have no reason to believe that the general’s influence on policy is either harmful or unwise. 7. On the brighter side of the political picture I am able to report that the Prime Minister has recently made a tour of the Diwaniyah Province, where his evident interest in the welfare of the people and his attention to their EASTERN (Iraq).

He called on me the day before he left Bagdad and convinced me that he sincerely wished to end tribal quarrels and to put a stop to the division of the tribes into those for and those against the Government in Bagdad. I hope that his visit will do lasting good, although the Euphrates tribes will, 1 fear, inevitably continue to be the danger point of southern Iraq for many years to come. 8. In the meanwhile, the elections have been going on quietly in the usual way and the final polling for the new Chamber of Deputies is expected to take place before the end of the month. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT the honour to inform you that the Popular Reform League has been receiving very little support in spite of its advanced programme and the backing of two daily newspapers. The Prime Minister has held himself aloof and this has discouraged many from joining. Others are alarmed by the rumours which have been current that some of its organisers were Communists at heart. 2. A few days ago the committee of the league represented their difficulties to the Prime Minister and urged him to help them by becoming a member. Hikmat Sulaiman refused, but suggested that the league should be absorbed into a political party with a less radical creed. It could then become the official party of the present Government. 3. This project was discussed at a meeting held on the 9th January at the house of the Minister for Finance. Cabinet Ministers, politicians and journalists attended. It was decided that the new party should take the name of the Popular Reform party and that the members of the Cabinet should themselves form its Executive Committee. Five of those present were elected to co-operate with the Ministers in drawing up the party’s creed and regulations. 4. The league thus disappears and its place will be taken by a Government party formed in the manner customary for organisations of this kind in Iraq. 5 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

Saiyid Asirn-al-Gilani, in his stead. ‘2. The posts of naqib and trustee are thus again joined and popular opinion will, I believe, approve of this return to precedent. Rashid Ali’s assumption of the trusteeship was generally regarded as something of a scandal and his abuse of his authority as Minister of the Interior to extort rents and other dues from the tenants on the Qadiriyah estates brought discredit upon the Government of which he was a member. 3.
