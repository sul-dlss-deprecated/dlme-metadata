A.AiDRAFT LETTER I.A.D.Wilson-Young, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W. 1. 2 APR me Dear Wilson-Young, . • I have now looked tq) the papers about Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah who formed the subject of your letter of the 22nd March (F.i^/l/Sl) • I find that his activities in South America have already been brought to the notice of the South American Department by Vereker (see his letter dated 23rd January which was copied to us under No. U-' 0 % / / 6 ^ 2 . &amp; Htu+'L,!' kr&gt;n ' Cc H f * c - V ASmQ62/b27/b6). Subsequently to Gibson's letter to Ferowne of the 19th February, No.Pol.(3)213/4^* further enquiries were made here and we discovered that his visit to South America is sponsored by the Ministry of Food with the approval of the War Office and the Government of India, and that the arrangements were made through the Foreign Office by the Army Requirements Branch of this Office. The object of the visit is to examine the possibilities of obtaining /CannedCanned Meat prepared in accordance with Mohammedan religious requirements for the use of Moslem Troopo of the Indian ^rmy. I understand that his tasK ls practically complete and that he should be back in this country soon. As he is accompanied only by his son, who acts as his Secretary, he is hardly entitled to call himself the Head of a Mission, and although it is true that the arrangements for his visit were made by this Office, he is not in South America as a representative of the Office and we are not pleased that he has been so describing himself. Ikbal Ali Shah is an Indian Moslem of Afghan extraction who is in receipt of a small, political pension from the Government of India by virtue of services rendered to the Crown by an ancestor of his. We have known him over a l ^g period as a free lance journalist and writer of books of a popular type on Muslim questions arising in India and Afghanistan. In 193k he was given a post in the Information Section of the League of Nations in a temporary capacity; and in 19W it was decided to make© use of aim in this country by giving him employment in the Ministry of Information and he gave some broadcasts in Urdu. Although as you will see from this brief account, we have on occasion found it useful to give employment to Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, we certainly do not regard him as a representative of 2 «£oslem India and we consider that he would be a most unsuitable person to entrust with a mission to Java of the character proposed. Yours sincerely, U D M. CLEARrAt the end of last week Count Bentinck, Counsellor at the Netherlands Embassy, mentioned to me that the Netherlands Minister at Montevideo had reported to The Hague a conversation which he had had quite recently with Sir DaJikbal\ Ali Sjah who was apparently Head of an IndiJ Office Mission in South America. According to the Minister’s report Sir Darikbal had broached the subject of Indonesia and had suggested that an approach to the Moslem element in Java might prove fruitful, possibly through leading Indian co-religionists. Sir Darkkbal indicated that he might be prepared to go to Javt himself, if the Netherlands Government though he could help. Count Bentinck askeu me whether we aould let him know what the exact status was of Sir DarfLkbal. Could you please let me know, therefore, Anything about Sir Daijikbal’s background and his suitability or otherwise tor offering his services in the Indonesian dispute.

No*36(I&gt;IY-1936, dated May 14, 1938, I oil airected to say that the Government of India’s re^ly in regard to the devolution of pensions in the Sardnajaa family has since been received in their letter No •144/36-Public, dated June ^a co^y of which v;as forwarded to you under Government endorsement No.C-137-IV.1937, dated July 21, 1938. The view has been taken by tiie Provincial Government ana accepted by the Government of India that on the death of a member of the Sardnana family receiving a pension, his pension, or, if a portion of it has been commuted during his lifetime, the residue I 0 i miu pension, should descend to his legitimate male issue, and where there is no legitimate male issue, to all the lineal male descendants of the original grantee, liawab Jan Fishan Khan Bahadur. The position is the same in the case of the Bulandshahr family, tue descendants of .Agha Syed Mir Khan, Sardar Bahadur of Ehanpur, whose pensions are enjoyed on the same terms, viz. that they shall be continued in ^er^etuity to the lineal heirs mle, lawfully begotten, of the original grantee, on condition of loyal behaviour and active service in times of trouble or disomer. 3« The policy of Governmen t in regard to the commutation of tneae Bardhana and Bulanasnanr pensions has been reviewed on this basis and I am to communicate the following orders for your information and guidance and tuat of the Collectors of Meerut and Bulandshahr • These pensions should as far as possible remain intact, or at any rate, stand at a reasonable figure for the benefit of succeeding generations* Commutation should accordingly be discouraged e^ce^t when a pension is reduced by sub-division2 . to aii aLiOurjt below Ra. 5 p.m. ir|wLich case trie question of couinuting it compulsorily should be considered. Every application for co/amatation received by the district autiicrities Si.oula be carefully examined with due re 0 ard to the provisions of para. &lt;18S of the Lanual of Oovernment Orders and to the fact that the pensioner has, or is without, any legitimate male issue to whom tne residue of his pension .vcula ordinarily descend. In view of tiie principle accepted by the Grovernment of Inuia regarding the inheritance of these pensions, the present practice of taking the consent of the pensioner's heirs in the person of his nearest relatives assumes greater importance. A strict application of the principle will require that an applicant for commutation who has no legitimate male issue should first obtain the consent of all the other living male lineal descendants of the original grantee. The Provincial Government consider tnat this requirement should be insisted upon as it will tend to discourage tue frequent applications for commutation that have been maae in trie past by pensioners who are without imle issue. The knowledge that their pensions cannot readily be commuted will, it is hoped, further reduce the number cf applicants for commutation and act as a check on prodigality. The substance of these orders should therefore be communicated to the heads of the Sardhana and Bulandsmaiir families and, through them, to the other members of the families who are in receipt of pensions.

Ikbal Ali Shah f s request on that occasion was refused, his father refusing to agree. It now appears that with the death of his father Ikbal Ali Shah becomes entitled to the pension previously paid to his father, amounting to Rs.18 per month.

A day ka^tieQJigQ jjb/ received a visit from the Sirdar Ikhal Ali Shah, who brought a letter of introduction to the Secretary of State from Sir Mohamed Zafrullah Khan, and I enclose a record y/hich l made of the conversation which I had with the Sirdar. Before we consider whether it would be possible for either the Vansittart committee or the British Council to make any use of the Sirdar’s services, we should be very grateful for any information you might be able to obtain for us about his past activities with the Bureau of Public Information in India. Yours sincerely. W.u^qJJUIT M.J. Clauson, EsqCOPY Secretary of State. The Sirdar Ikbal All Shah (who had a letter of introduction to you from Sir Mohamed Zafrullah Khan) called here this afternoon. He stated that he was a British subject born of Afghan parents and that he had worked in the past for the Bureau of Public Information in India. The Sirdar is now resident in this country, writing books, articles and letters to newspapers in which he tries to explain the Moslem world to the people of this country. He is anxious to be put into touch with the Vansittart Committee with a view to serving also as an interpreter of Western thought and activities to the countries of the East. The Sirdar said that he did not wish to approach the India Office or the Colonial Office, partly because he did not want to conflict with the activities of the Cxovernment of India and partly because his aim was to cover all Moslem countries and not merely India. He said that he makes a living by his books and does not wish for paid employment. Nor does he wish to be commissioned to write articles for the Moslem world so much as to be taken on as an unofficial adviser on the Oriental mentality to the Vansittart Committee, and if possible to the British Council. As an example of what he wanted the sirdar mentioned certain English films such as ’'Bengal Lancer” which circulated in Eastern countries and which could, if account were taken of Oriental mentality, both avoid offending opinion in the East and also serve as much better British propaganda. Similarly in broadcasting the Sirdar thought that he might be of value. The Sirdar said that he has spoken to Lord Lloyd who had givan him to understand that neither the scope nor • • •nor the funds of the British Council were such as to enable them to make use of his services. He therefore wanted to be put into touch with the Vansittart Committee. He would also, if any use were made of his services, like an introduction to Sir John Anderson whose recommendation would, he said, carry great weight among Indian Moslems. I thanked the sirdar for his offer and told him that I could not say whether there was any s cope for activities such as he suggested within the sphere of the Vansittart Committee but promised to pass on what he had said to the Secretary of the Committee and let him know the result.

He has written a good deal about Afghanistan and represents himself to be a subject of that country where, in fact, I believe he has never been. About five years ago he was on the London staff of two English newspapers published in India, the “Civil and Military Gazette” and the 'Pioneer’' , and in this capacity came in contact a certain amount with the India Office. We found him well disposed, but a bit of a romancer. He now does work for the Afghan Minister, but I do not know v/hat his position is in the Legation. His project for an Anglo-Islamic or Anglo-Oriental Society is characteristically vaguett looks as if* 1 *fc cover much the same ground as some existing organizations. In any case it is doubtful whether he has the influence to carry it through. It might, however, be useful, subject to the views of the Foreign Office, for you to see him, if you have time, and ascertain in more detail what his scheme is and how far he is able to implement it. But you will presumably not wish to give the project/■ project the support of the British Council unless it is pretty clear from other evidence than v/hat Ikhal Ali Shah says that it is likely to come to something.

X should be glad to have an opportunity of meeting you to discuss as to what can be done in this regard, Indeed, X had already spoken to your Mr. Adis on the subject last autumn, and the matter might have been mentioned to you, for all X know. Xn replying to this, perhaps you would oblige me by writing to me at ay above address, and not at the Afghan Legation, because X keep my private activities separate from official ones. ilth compliments, Yours Very Truly, (Sgd) Xkbal All Shar.

I !&lt;) My dear Walton, I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from Macgregor of the 3.B.G. about a suggested broadcast on Arabic Movements of the Present Time by Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah. I have told Macgregor that at first sight we didn’t much like the idea, but that I would communicate with him again after con sulting the India Office and the Foreign Office. Perhaps you would kindly ring me up and tell me how the suggestion strikes you. I am writing similarly to Rendel at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely,Copy. 1INSIDE ARABIA TO-DAY'. The following are rough outlines about a talk on what is happening in Arabia now. What is suggested below might form the basis of a final idea; and a successful skeleton can be made by addition of other ideas Irom yoxip or oy modification of these to your own purpose* which could be evolved by a conversation between us at your convenience one afternoon - after six* almost any day* except Saturday next: and* I await your observations on this subject. Meantime, here is my idea: 'In the beginning of the Talk* social* economic and political developments amongst the Arabs to be described very briefly as a contemporary background. The controversial aspects of Palestine and Syria to be strictly omitted* only a passing reference to them to be made. Then* the all important Arab Nationalism Hovement to be fully described. Its real meaning and purpose to be laid bare. Various shapes that that movement is taking in the several Arab regions to be shown. The personalities behind this ’progress of Arabia’ to be lightly touched upon, veil to be lifted from off the domestic rivalries and to show some ’human-side-lights* in the evolution of this coming together of the Arab races, as seen in the current news from those parts of the world. In short to give an OBJECT IVE bird’s eye view to an average listener so that he may know in simple words as to what is happening in Arabia to-day, and the reason of those happenings.'———.
