In the letter Ahmud ben Khautoom, Sheikh of Congoon [Kangān], acknowledges the receipt of the recipient's letter. He refers to the seizure of two boats which were carrying letters addressed to Samuel Manesty (see f 41v 2). Ahmud ben Khautoom (spelled Ahmed ben Khartoom in f 41v 2) claims that the letters belonging to Manesty were opened by his people without his knowledge. He discusses the return of the two boats and promises to defer his dispute with the people of Bussora [Basra].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023598787.0x000065#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
