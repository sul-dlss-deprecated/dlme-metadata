Scott told me voluntarily in an unofficial talk the other day that he understood that the Gulf Company had some little time ago been on the Transatlantic telephone to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company about going half shares on a new effort for the Neutral Zone i.e. as the Kuwait Oil Company. Sc ott says that Lord Cadman replied in vaguely polite terms and subsequently having, gone into the matter, the Angl o-Ir anlan Oil Company turned it aown definitely. The next thing they knew was that Davis was unusually anxious to come here at once. Neither Davis, Scott or Dickson mentioned this approach of Davis* to the Sheikh. I got on to it through a hint from Holmes, and on my skirting the subject with the Sheikh, he then told me. 3. The meeting at which the suggestion was made took place in Dickson's house, and he told Scott soon afterwards. ('I was very pleased with him’’ said Scott).It was rather a peculiar story how they all three came to be there in Dickson's house and is ''fishy'. My impression is that tne Kuwait Oil Company knew that Davis was going to have a shot at the Neutral Zone, washed their hands of it but wished him luck. It may be that it was arranged and not accidental that the meeting should be at a call by the Sheikh A.C.Galloway, I.A., ‘etary to the Political Resident • the Persian Gulf, Bushire.*1 - 2 - on Mrs Dickson (a call that has never been made before by the Sheikh) so as to avoid the look of an official approach involving the Kuwait Oil Company, I presume, if anything came out of it,there would in fact be some arrangement behind the scenes between the Anglo- 1rani an Oil Company and the Gulf. With regards to the points you raise in Para 3 (a) I cannot find any record that the Gulf Company have been instructed by His Majesty’s Government to keep us informed with regard to approaching the Sheikh about the Neutral Zone (b) I cannot find any record that a similar request has been made even to the Kuwait Oil Company will you please confirm that it is correct.

The Residency, Bushire, the 6 th December, 19 38. D.O.NQ* 673-S. de Gaury reports the following which I pass on for your information* In November Major Davis, one of the American representatives of the Gulf Oil Company element in the Kuwait Oil Company, visited Kuwait in that capacity, at any rate ostensibly. During his visit he took the opportunity to approach the Shaikh through Dickson on behalf of the Gulf Oil Company in connection with obtaining a concession in the Neutral Zone. The Shaikh replied, as he had done to Holmes who approached him a year or so ago on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Limited, that there was nothing doing. The Shaikh quite correctly informed de Gaury of this approach. 2* The Kuwait Oil Company, whose employee Dickson of course is, made no objection to his being made use of as an intermediary and so I presume Davis*s approach to the Shaikh had their blessing. Petroleum Concessions Limited have received instructions - vide India Office telegram No.1166 of 24th June - that they must keep us informed of any approach they make to the Shaikh, but I cannot find on my files that either the Kuwait Oil Company or the Gulf Oil Company have received similar communications* I do not think that it is worth while at present for His Majesty’s Government to address such a communication to them, so long as we can rely on the A Shaikh letting us know as t o any approach which may be made to / .T.Peel Bsquire, M.C., The India Office, London*to him. Should, however, these Companies at any time in the future enter into negotiations with the Shaikh for the Neutral Zone, we can inform them that we must be kept informed of their progress. 3. In the meantime I am as King de G&amp;ury to convey verbally to the Shaikh my thanks for his having informed de Saury of Davis*s approach, and of my appreciation of the Shaikh’s under standing of the desirability of passing on to de Gaury news of any further approaches from whomsoever they may come concerning the Neutral Zone. * 4.

Kuwait. cL-Z- S* - v Major Holmes, the Oil Concessionaire, employed by P.C.L. returned here yesterday from Bahrein, after seeing Skliros in Bagdad. The Sheikh atonce called upon him, and Holmes then came here. 2 . Skliros, he says, is leaving for England on the 15th December, and will not now be coming to xvuwait. Holmes told me that he had just informed the Sheikh that his Company were still interested in the Neutral Zone, and that they had already had some conversation with the Saudi Arabs about it. The Sheikh had made no co.jment. What he said he had not told the Sheikh was that the Emir Saud had made advances to P.C.L. about a concession to cover not only the Neutral Zone, but all the other remaining unalloted territory of Saudi Arabia. The Emir Saud had said that Saudi Arabia was now free of its commitment to the Standard Oil Company in regard to the Kuwait Neutral Zone. Holmes had no details as to how this had been achieved, but suggested that any monetary commitment might have been dissipated by an agreement as to deductions, over a period, from future royalties on the paying wells in the existing concession area. In any case the Saudis had gone as far as offering financial and definite terms to P.C.L. ^he size I’ble Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Sical Resident, Persian G-ulf, BUS H 1 RE- 2 - ® 05) |5 of these, said Holmes, had made Skliros T, spar for wind a bit', but Skliros proposed, as soon as sufficient time had elapsed, which he considered it would have by the time he had returned to London, reopening talks about the proposal with the Saudi Arabian G-overnment, through their Legation. 4 # According to Holmes, Skliros, and therefore his Company is not any longer on good terras with the Standard Oil Company, owing, he thought, to their 'putting a spoke in the recent negotiations in Iraq. I am not quite sure of the significance, if any, of this remark, which Holmes did not seem prepared, or able, to enlarge upon, out I incline it, as he made it, and in case it is found to have any beaming on the latest moves, or alternatively, on what it is desired should be thought about them. As to the Neutral ^one, Holmes said, very confidently, that he believed that both sides would agree upon the appointment of a single neutral Governor, and that the administrative problem therefore could be overcome. Ibn Saud was anxious to come to terms witr them, and so the Sheikh might already have received private letters about it from him. His impression was that the Sheikh did already know something about what had been going on. and is waiting with impatience for instructions from Skliros, which he expects after the latter’s return to London and discussion with His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Legation. 6 -He seems genuinely anxious to get something done, (copy sent to I.O.&amp; G.of I.under P.L.No.716-3 of 15/12/38, copy of bare P.L.to Kt.-Hef.P.R.♦a letter No.673-3 of 6/12/38).Confidential.

I said that Hia Majesty’s Goyernment could not put pressure on t he Shaikh# to induce him to grant a concession which he did not want to give. He seemed to think that direct talks between Ibn Saud and the Shaikh might have a good effect, but His Majesty’s Government might not approve ot that, though it would have the advantage that we should no longer appear as the villain. I know how difficult this matter is, but we ought to keep in mind the King’s close interest in the matter, now that we are casting about for means to keep him contented in case of trouble elsewhere.

Dear Baggallay, Under cover of India Office letter of the 25th^ A'oril, No. P.f .2058/39, we sent you a copy of a letter dated Iv'th April from Longrigg asking whether Petroleum Concessions Limited, who were restricted three years ago t to ao lying for an option over the Kowe it share in.the Neutral Zone, might now have permission to try for a c onc e ssion . 2. Early in 1936 the Company sought permission to apply for a concession and the matter was discussed in Foreign Office despatch to Jedda No.67 of the 12t::i March 1936 (E. 1063/260/91) . On 'die one hand it was felt that to grant the Company’s request might cause political difficulties with Ton Baud, since the California Arabian Standard Oil Company already had certain rights of option in respect of the Saudi share oi the Neutral Zone, and if petroleum Concessions Limited obtained a full concession from the Sheikh the effect might well be to/ gallay, Esq. , i Office,s. 5, to perpetuate the present deadlock and .to render even more remote the prospects of any agreed concession being granted to a single company by both rulers' 1 which would conduce to f exploitation of oil in the neutral zone and so benefit Ibn Baud’s exchequer. On the other hand the advantages of preventing”a further potentially important area in Arabia from falling under the exclusive comrnerical control of an entirely non-British company” were appreciated 3 and as it was felt that this end might be achieved if the Sheikh were to : give a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited the despatch expressed a sympathetic attitude to the Company’s request. Ryan stated his views with some diffidence in lute- t&gt;*So Jedda telegram No.46 of the 14th April, 1936, but on the whole thought that a concession would only complicate the situation further and that an option would be adequate to safeguard Petroleum Concessions Limited’s position. Pucther consideration was rendered unnecessary when the Company themselves decided to apply only for an option. 3. In essentials the position today is very much what it was three years ago. Petroleum Concessions Limited failed to secure an option from the Sheikh, who as recently as last December (Political Agent's letter C.395 of 8th December, enclosure to India Office letter P.Z.8448/38 of the 3rd January ) reaffirmed his intention not to cede any oil rights in/3. n the Neutral Zone or even to discuss the matter with any il Company. Nor have they succeeded in obtaining a Dncession from the Saudis? who are asking a high price and re probably engaged in forcing up the amount to be paid by ne Standard Oil Company who have every intention of securing ne Neutral Zone for themselves if they can. 4. The question is therefore whether the political ifficulties believed in 1936 to arise if the Sheikh were to ive a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited are still d be apprehended, Pe are inclined to think they are less srious now that Ibn Saud is assured of an income from the asa Oil royalties, ^ Moreover it is not clear that Ibn aud could reasonably object to our allowing Petroleum Concessions Lmited to seek a concession from the Sheikh, and if the )mpany succeed in v/inning over the Sheikh it is probable aat they would do more to remove than to accentuate the padlock which was feared in 19 36 and is now partly due to the ieikh f s refusal to do business. Apart from this, we lagine that the petroleum Department would be anxious to )e Petroleum Concessions Limited’s request granted if it &gt;uld be of benefit to a Company that is not wholly foreign. 5. We should be glad to have your views on the matter. If/4. Ilf' the Company’s request is granted they v/ould oe reminded W ? __ uni iinn 11 Ji^at any concession given hy the Sheikh in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone uould he suoject go Cxie conclusion of such an agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company as His Majesty’s Government may think necessary for the protection oi their own inuereoto in the event of the concession becoming operative. 6.

I am v/riting to say that, if you think that the moment is opportune from the political point of view, we should support an attempt by the company to obtain a concession from the Sheikh of Koweit. 7e should certainly prefer to sec a Company in which there is a substantial British interest operating in this area, although we realise that even if Petroleum Concessions Limited secure the concession f from the Sheikh of Koweit they will still have to come to terms with the Saudi Arabian Government, 3.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 1st June, 1939. ,3534/68/91). My dear Peel, Would you please refer to your letter I' - b* Vo P.Z. 2458/39 of the 11th May regarding the wish of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for a concession over the Koweit share in the Neutral Zone? t 11 jjlJ&gt;or&gt; „ ,,111 u Ijj!!. , [jnqourju. inxi-ww m i D ^ ^ f 2. I enclose a copy of a letter of the 15th’April from Bullard to Baxter, from which you will see that the Saudi Government are very anxious that the Neutral Zone should he developed and are inclined to think that \ the American and British interests concerned are obstructive. 3. We feel therefore that it might be a good thing if Petroleum Concessions Limited could induce the Sheikh to give them a concession in respect of his own rights in the Neutral Zone, An approach by the Company to the Sheikh, even if unsuccessful, might make Ibn Saud think ■chat we are as anxious as he to exploit the oil in the Neutral Zone. In these circumstances, we feel that the political difficulties which existed in 1936 have to a large extent lost their force and that it does not really make much difference whether Petroleum Concessions Limited seek, or ootain, an option or a concession from the Sheikh. In lack, owing to the way Ibn Saud has tied himself up with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (as we now know) the grant of. a concession by the Sheikh seems an essential preliminary to the working of the Neutral Zone. °* ^ ^ le same time it seems that even if the Sheikh does grant a concession there will still be a lot fence 0 to jump. The next move would presumably be that Ibn Saud would ,T * Esq., m.C. grant a concession in respect of his2. ovm rights, either to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company if they were willing to cap the terms obtained by the Sheikh, or to some other company if they were unwilling. 6. If, as a result of all this, the Sheikh and Ibn Saud had given concessions to different companies, the next step would presumably have to be for the two companies to agree between themselves how the actual exploration and exploitation of the Neutral Zone was to be carried out. They might or might not decide to divide the area up between them territorially or, alternatively, to work through some joint organisation. But whatever they decided, they would probably have to arrange for the Sheikh and Ibn Saud to receive equal royalties and other profits, for it is, I suppose, improbable that these two rulers would agree to any territorial division which affected either their sovereignty or their financial prospects i«e. neither would be likely to agree to depend for his profits on a certain portion only of the Zone, which might prove better than the portion taken by his rival, but which might also prove worse. ^• It is, however, conceivable that the concessions might be obtained by the same company and this could happen in the following two ways, among others: (a) the Sheikh might grant his concession to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company who would presumably be willing to cap their own terms in order to obtain Ibn Baud’s concession. (ft) California Arabian Standard Oil Company might be unwilling to cap terms granted by the Sheikh to Petroleum Concessions limited and Petroleum Concessions Limited might/might then succeed in securing the concession from Ton Saud. It is also possible, at least in theory, that the Sheikh and Ibn Saud might grant concessions to companies quite different from Petroleum Concessions Limited and California Arabian Standard Oil Company, 8. The Foreign Office have in the past held the view, and still do so, that it is most important to get Ibn Saud every additional source of revenue we can. We therefore much hope that the Sheikh will be persuaded by Petroleum Concessions Limited to grant them a concession. We realise, however, that he may still refuse to do so. If we thought he would be any more likely to grant California Arabian Standard Oil Company a concession we should not, from the point of view of Ibn Saud's interests, be sorry if he did so. But we know that, to other departments concerned, this possibility is most unwelcome and we have in the circumstances no intention of suggesting that the Sheikh should be encouraged along these lines. We also refrain, out of deference to the views of the other departments, from pressing for the direct discussions between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh, which Ibn Saud has suggested, to be encouraged In fact, it may be best to try to ignore this request, as it might only lead to the two of them agreeing to give California Arabian Standard Oil Company a joint concession Equally, as we realise, it might merely confirm the oheikh in his determination to sit tight in the hope that the whole of the Neutral Zone will one day come into his sole possession. I am ©ending copies of this letter to Starling and Jarrett, Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay.&amp; ® 9. INDIA OFFICE, 7HITEHALL, j4ch June, 1939. My dear Baggallay, I .[any thanks for your letter of the 1st June (E.3534/ 63/91) about the desire of Petroleum Concessions Limited _ -i-r o r&gt;n-npor ;r i nn •pnt.hr-*r i than an ontion over the and of Starling’s letter of the 25th Hay (P.D.V'4-5 Part 3), we are informing Longrigg that His Majesty’s Government wi have no objection if the Company wish to try for a full —-———•——-—■————- - -■—* ~ concession. that the Sheikh, who cherishes the ambition to secure I for himself the whole of the Neutral Zone, will respond to any overtures from Petroleum Concessions Limited or any other Company. de Gaury, whom we have just seen here, confirms this view. *7e cannot undertake to try to move the Sheikh from this position. If there were any hope of progress it would more probably lie in Ibn Saud and the Sheikh evolving some arrangement between them. ;allay, Esq, , 2 From his past attitude it seems very unlikely Foreign Office Prima facie, and subject/4 ./ &amp;) ® UM* o • subject to the views of the Gulf authorities, we ourselves should have no objection to Ibn Saud and the Sheikh getting together informally on this question on the clear understanding that any arrangements resulting from their talks would not be binding without our approval, ■ but as you suggest in paragraph 8 or your letter, it is doubtful whether we should encourage such a move. Possibly Ibn Saud, if he is really keen, will, without any intervention on our part, take advantage of the Sheik’s visit to Riyadh this month to sound him in the matter. If he did so, we would consult the Political Resident as to the attitude to be adopted in the matter. For strategical reasons it v/ould seem expedient that any sources of oil that may exist in the Gulf area more or less under our control should be exploited and we should welcome the development of any oil there may be in the Neutral Zone on this account as well as for the strengthening of Ibn Saud’s resources. But if the Sheikh were willing to give a concession at all, the position as between Petroleum Concessions Limited and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company if it were a question of a single company acquiring rights over the whole area, would require consideration.India Office, ’''hitehall, London, 14th June, 1939. ’ Dear Mr. Longrigg, ^ In reply to your letter of the Ifth April (reference P.C.35/27), in the matter of oil rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone, I am desired to inform you that His Majesty's Government, in modification of the views expressed in 1936, will not raise any objection if your Company shoulu wish to apply to the Sheihh of Koweit for a concession and not an option only in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone. You will understand of course that any concession given by the Sheikh would be subject to the conclusion of such an agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government as might be thought necessary to safeguard the latter's political interests.

Subject. x ransmits text of new agreement between Gaudi , ‘ L rahian G yernment and California Arabian Standard u il Company dated ^ay31st*,1939.♦THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ‘ I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the agreement which was signed at Riyadh on the 31st May last by representatives of the Saudi Arabian Government and of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. The procedure of ratification by both parties will be understood from the terms of articles 15 and 16 of the agreement: the ratification of the Saudi Arabian Government was published in the Mecca paper Umm-al-Qura on the 7th July, 1939; the agreement itself was not published in the local press until the 21st July, which, under article 15, becomes the ‘ ‘ effective date ’ ’ on which the agreement 3 nters 5 into force. It is evident that the San Francisco office of the company must have forwarded its ratification, though no formal notice to that effect has ^et appeared. 2. The text of the agreement will no doubt be studied by the competent departments of His Majesty’s Government, and I propose to confine myself in this despatch to a few comments on some points, which, on a first reading, appear to me worthy of notice. 3^ The references in this agreement to the previous one signed in 1933 accord oerfectly with the text of the latter instrument, which was printed as an enclosure ;o Foreign Office Print (Confidential) No. 15474 of the 22nd September, 1938.(') There is, however, no mention of any document dated the 27th May, 1933; the new agreement refers to the original 1933 agreement as “ the Saudi Arab Concession,” and says that it was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the same day as that on which Mr. L. N. Hamilton addressed to the Saudi Minister of Finance his letter con taining four paragraphs and now called the “ Second Principal Agreement.” 4. The areas to which the new agreement, or rather the three agreements aken together, applies are set forth in the terminal schedule. Not only is the previous concessionary area in Eastern Arabia included, but a northern area, a iouthern area, and the two neutral zones are now allotted to the company for exploitation. I learn from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that His Majesty turned over in lis mind for a long time the question of the boundaries of the northern and iouthern areas : he is unwilling to have any oil prospecting in the centre of the eountry, and he knows that there is considerable doubt as to where its frontiers •eally are. The new areas cannot be traced on a map unless the position of such )oints as “ the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana,” the “ southern nd of the westerly edge of the Dahana,” “ the north-east corner of the boundary ine between Yemen and Saudi Arabia,” and of the northern edge of the Great ^efud are first determined. I have not yet been able to fix these places with any Accuracy on any map. 5. No mention is made in the new agreement of the “ contact line between he sedimentary and the igneous formations ’ ’ which probably does not coincide Gth the eastern edge of the Red Sea Concession. But it is clear from article 12 hat whatever preference rights the company possessed under the previous agree- nents over areas not yet assigned to them still persist. 6. The company has the right, under section (c) of article 6, to promote a ompany or companies of a nationality acceptable to the Government to exploit he oil in either of the neutral zones; it also possesses various rights of transport n and access to those zones. 7. Article 9 gives the company certain rights over the area assigned in 1936 o Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in the Red Sea area. EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. iVugust 10, 1939.

The consideration paid and to be paid for these extensions of the company’s area of operations appears very liberal. £140,000 gold is payable at once; thereafter an annual rental of £20,000 is to be paid; and whenever oil in commercial quantities is discovered in the additional areas a further sum of £100.000 gold will be paid. From July 1940 onwards, until oil is discovered in the new areas, 1,300.000 gallons of gasoline and 100,000 gallons of kerosene will be presented to the Saudi Arabian Government, and after such a discovery is made the amount of gasoline will be increased by 1 million gallons. I have not heard what actual sum in cash has passed; it is clear from the last words of article! that the rental due under the 1933 agreements had been overpaid, and I should not be surprised to learn that advances have been made on account of the increased sums which will be payable in future. 9.

We have for a long time past been endeavouring to acquire the Shaikh of Kuwait’s rights over the territory. You instructed us in April, 1936 that our efforts must be limited to an oution: but by your letter of June 14th, 1939 to me you intimated that no objection now existed to our applying to the Shaikh for a Concession. The acquisition of this concession would normally have iound a place in our 1939/40 winter programme. As it is, you will appreciate that war conditions restrict our activities considerably and make it less easy to despatch a senior representative to the spot. Nevertheless, we are far from willing to let our candidature for this territory fail by default, and we have in the past been encouraged to consider ourselves as candidates acceptable to H.M.G. In these circumstances, we should be very grateful for your advice. If you can assure us that you would not concur m the grant of the rights concerned to any other party without our having been given prior notice and a fair chance to make our own offers, then we will gladly leave the matter as it now Cinas# you cannot give such an assurance, do you think it Kuwait. The rights over the other half, belonging to H.M.Ibn should. MJjj&amp;Ee a .forward move, in’ n! the near future? ' i No. 46 17 NOV 1939 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL DEPT. We/ INDIA OFFICEsoon or ultimately to obtain would be in practice unworkable unless we can agree a practicable scheme of joint operation with the California Company; initial overtures for the framing of such a scheme were, in fact, considered some months ago, and could be followed up. It might take the form of a joint company to be formed ad hoc as soon as the Shaikh has granted us his half-rights, the concession document containing provision for this. Alternatively - and a tempting alternative in view of] the great difficulty anticipated in v/orking in territory under divided sovereignty - the Foreign Office and your own department might agree to recommend to the two rulers a physical division of the Zone into two parts, to be attached to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia respectively in full sovereignty. An unofficial conversation with H.M 1 s.Minister in Jeddah early this year did not seem to reveal any objection to this idea. These, obviously, are matters in which we depend on the policy and views of H.M.G. 'he shall be grateful for any indication of these which you can give us, more particularly as they apply to our immediate problem of obtaining the Kuwait rights. Yours sincerely, Stephen K.Longrigg. 3-T.Peel Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.'o, II'IDIA OFFICE ,977/39 15th November 1939 Pear Mr.Longrigg, y Would you please refer to your letter of the 6th November (P.C.35) regarding the acquisition of oil rights over the Kov/eit Neutral Zone* of an oil concession in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone.

Holmes appears to have given Company to understand that he is free of obligations to other interests or persons who may wish to acquire these rights.

You will recollect that on your last visit I gave you further details of the drilling operations that C.A.S.O.C. were engaged in at Abrag al Kabrit, some 25 miles S.W. of Arq wells on the southern border (centre) of the Kuwait Neutral Zone (see also this office News Letters for week ending 23-4-43, 30-4-43 and 7-5-43 respectively). I mentioned also that ii 1 could get time to spare I pro posed running down anyt paying a visit to the drilling camp in question as I was particularly anxious to bring back samples of water from the new water well which supplied the camp and which I understood lay 3 miles west of same. On 6.5.43 I enquired from the General Manager Dhahran if I might visit Abraq Kabrit camp. On 8.5.43 Mr. Ohliger telegraphed a cordial invita- ation to visit not only Kabrit but to continue on to Dhahran. As the season was too far advanced for such an undertaking and as car difficulties had to be considered, I replied by wire that 1 could only visit Kabrit. The 1.A. who was kept informed by me of my proposed Journey was very helpful ana the Saudi Arabian Government’s local representative gave his approval and furnished me with an ofiicial letter to the Saudi Arabian representative on the spot. On 12-5-43(p.m,) I proceeded to Abraq Kabrit via the Neutral Zone route, spent the night en route and reached my destination at 7.30 a.m. on 13-5-43. I received a most cordial and kindly welcome from the Supdt in charge of the camp and all the C.A.S.O.C. st&amp;ff, alter spending the whole of the 13-5-43 and the following night with them, returned at dawn on 14-5-43 via the west ern Garaa route lying approx. 15 miles west of the Shaqq oepression). I entered Kuwait territory via Minaqish. The outward journey took 5 running hours, ana the homeward journey b| running hours. Distances were approximately as iollows; outward 110 miles; homeward 125 miles. Y/hilst at Kabrit camp (which incidentally is called 'Jauf' by C.A.S.O.C. folk), I was shown everything, ncluding the rig and the water well and was taken over the KhaliJa 'Sink', some 6 miles distant which local 3adawin claim to be the site where a meteorite &lt;£el 1 many years agol I I purposely asked no questions about oil drilling oper- ations as this would have been in baa taste, but I gathered that drilling had been going on for a ronth, anc that sand** ailficulties haa been encountered. 1 emphasised that I was onry interested in the Con^any’s water well, hhd at my request the Supdt. in charge gave me a drum of- 2 - ts‘' sent to you y t&gt; gimiiar aaiaples were given to H.H. tomorrow (17-b-4i) and r ao resent at ive Abaitl Aziz the ShaiK'n and tlie local Saudi Represenvaix al Nafiai who aa^ed for aaine. when being ah own over the 'ater well, X ^ t °^ ower . that the depth to water * 6 ° “ ^n^pumpel it ful centrifugal pump brough p „ Tl water well contained through a 6* pipe to the camp area.

Rhoades said he did not propose to use Dickson as an interpreter when discussing the .Neutral Zone 'because (a) he was a servant of the Kuwait Oil Company, (h) he would find difficulty in translating technical terms, and (c) for reasons diich he did not clearly specify. I imagine that Abdulla mill a will prove more pliable than Jickson and that Rhoades* decision to bide his time before approaching the Shaikh is to enable him to pave the way gently and not as he would have me believe because he did not wish to shock His Highness, whose health he under stood was not as satisfactory as it might be, by too abrupt an approach.

Prel iminary . rr. .Rhoades accompanied hy *r. L.D. Scott, N.C. , the General Superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company Limited arrived from Ahadan in an Anglo -Iranian Oil Company.aircraft on the 16th of Lone. They paid a courtesy call on His Highness on the same * day and later called at the Agency, imo business was discussed with His Highness or with the Political Agent. Mr. Rhoades stated that he had come to Kuwait for two purposes ^hich were (a) to approach the Shaikh with regard to acquiring his rights in the .Neutral Zone, and (b) to prepare for certain preliminary operations in connection with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited’s Sulphur Concession. (a) Tith regard to the Neutral Zone Ir. Hhoades expressed surprise that the Shaikh had obtained such early information of the purpose of his visit. He would undoubtedly have been interested to learn the source of His Highness* information but care was taken not to satisfy his not unnatural curiosity. 2. Mr. Rhoades stated that he had been informed of the Shaikh’s attitude by the India Office when he was in London, but that the instructions he had received from his principals were clear and he had no option but to make an approach to His Highness. I informed Mr. 'Rhoades that His Highness had made it plain to me that he was not prepared to discuss this Question r ith him or with any other individual at the present time. Mr. Rhoades said he quite realised the position but he must carry out his instructions. If however the .Shaikh informed him that he would not discuss the matter then there would be no more to fe said for the time 'being. He does not propose to raise the question with His Highness for three or four weeks. Mr. Rhoades indicated that his Company (the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited) had had preliminary discussions with the California Arabia Standard Oil Company, who have already acquiredItm Gaud’s rights in the Neutral 4one, and that there tfas reason to believe that in the event of these negotiations with His Highness being successfully concluded the two companies would be able to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement for the development of the area. 4. :tr. Hhoades stated that he would keep hr. G-.N. Jackson (who will act as Political igent when I am in India) fully informed of the progress of the negotiations and that he proposed to utilise the services of Abdulla hulla Galeh, His Highness* Secretary, as interpreter when he discussed matters with the Shaikh. With regard to the Sulphur Concession Mr. Rhoades stated that it had been indicated to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited by the appropriate Department of the United States Govern lent that personnel and equipment not required by the Defence Services could be made available for the preliminary investigation which was necessary to determine accurately if the Tuvait sulphur deposits were sufficiently concentrated to make development on a co nercial scale practicable. If the result of this investigation was satisfactory then Mr. Rhoades understood that material for the immediate development of the field and the erection of the necessary refinery would be made available from the united States. (He anticipated that within two years production would be possible). 2. Hr. Rhoades proposes to examine the equipment remaining here belonging to the Kuwait Oil Company Limited and to draw up lists of further equipment that will have to be sent from America for the preliminary work and he expects that this will take him three or four weeks. He will then return to the United States after visiting the California irabia Standard Oil Company’s installation at Charan and the \n w lo-Iranian Oil Company’s at Ibadan. 3- The preliminary work will consist of sinking a numberr r -3- &lt;S) °\% of shafts in close proximity to each other to a depth of 1,500 feet in the neighbourhood of the Kuwait Oil Company's ho. 1 well and examining the resulting cores. ’ ,r r. Khoades thought that the equipment necessary for the operations would arrive from the United States in time for 7 oric to he commenced in October. Fe considered that the work would take from four to five months and that some six to ten drillers etc, presumably from tme limited States, rould be employed. 4. T understood from “ T r. bhoades that the production of sulphur was very necessary for war purposes especially in this part of the world and it as ^or this reason that the necessary eouipment rould be made available. 5. Kr. Uhoades proposed to inform the Shaikn of his intention tomorrow and assured ne that he mould keep 'r.

URGENT Dear Sir, f .9z With reference to your letter of May 5th, reference A.E./\/S.G. , regarding the intention of Mr,R,0,Rhoades to visit Xoweit to discuss the question of the Neutral Zone with His Highness the Sheikh, I think I should let you know that the Political authorities in the Gulf have now informed us that His Highness has stated that he will not discuss this subject with Mr. Rhoades or anyone else. It appears that when His Highness previously stated that he had no objection to Kr.Rhoades* visit, he was under the impression that it would be in connection with your Company’s Sulphur Concession, As you are no doubt aware, the Sheikh’s present refusal^ to discuss the question of the Neutral Zone is in accordance wit the attitude which he has consistently maintained for a number of years You will no doubt wish to infonn Mr, Rhoades at once of this development, in case in the circumstances he may decide to cancel the arrangements for his visit.

May, 1943. r Bridgeman, I promised to let you know what passed, at ; Interview with Rhoades and Angus of the Eastern '| ? Oil Company. Rhoades emphasised at the outset that his^ posed visit to Koweit had other objects besides that of otiating with the Sheikh about the neutral zone. His ipany’ s sulphur concession in Koweit obliged them to ertake a certain amount of drilling before December 1944 he wished to make arrangements for this on tne spot, did not know how the Sheikh had heard that he wished in lition to discuss the neutral zone, but he had no desire make a secret of his intentions in this respect. I said that the Sheikh had not got his formation from us or from the local Political authorities had told the latter that he would not discuss the sstion of the neutral zone with anyone, and they had &amp;sed this on to us with the suggestion that we should form Rhoades accordingly. We would not be prepared to t pressure on the Sheikh in a matter of this kind, or attempt to influence him one way or another. Rhoades id that he appreciated this and did not suspect the dftical authorities of having inf liiejJjQed the.. Sheikh* s ,e sent attitude. He agreed with me that the Sheikh had, ' r reasons of his own, maintained this attitude over a ^der of years, and that he had refused to depart from it : the time of his (Rhoades’) visit to Koweit in 1940. • I felt bound to tell Rhoades that Petroleum ^cessions Ltd. had also heard - but not from us - of his r °posed visit, tn Trnwp.it. and had said that if he was going/nnMTH' I'gPJTTAL .

Smelli ’’Hamilton suggests Rhoades oroceeds home vdiichever quickest and most convenient route.” This was nassed on to Rhoades at the Air Port Hotel, Basra. Dickson received a letter from Rhoades saying he was flvinm direct to the TJ.S.A. August 18th. Abdul Aziz al Nafisi, the Saudi Government Agent (auirox.) complained to DicKSon that aoparently Rhoades had gone to Dharan without nroper permission having been obtained as he had now received a letter of complaint from the Amir of Khabbar upbraiding him, Nafisi, for not having let him Know that '^hoades was coming and saying he had no information from other sources. 3. Rhoades flys out from the United States to discuss a subject he has been informed on the best authority that the Shaikh will not even consider and to make arrangements for extensive winter exploration by the Sulphur Company. The result of his talks with the Shaikh was a foregone conclusion. The work he did here about the forthcoming (?) operations of the Sulphur Company could have been done equally w'ell by telegram and in no way warranted the despatch of a person of Rhoades calibre. Some one must have wanted that Neutral pretty badly to have nulled sufficient strings Zone concession to get Rhoades’ transport/M OOOTIDSNTIAL . Political Agency, Kuwait 29th August 1943 ^lease refer to ray demi-official letter No.631 dated the 28th August 1943. 1 am enclosing copies of five letters from Holmes and a copy of a telegram to him from His Highness. I have recently been informed by the Shaikh that he has agreed to Holmes f suggestion of visiting Kuwait in the autumn^and I have seen a telegram from Holmes v/hich announced his intention of arriving here in October or November if he coild obtain the necessary passage. ^he first letter written on the 23rd of February contains a suggestion for the sub-division of the Neutral Zone should the Shaikh be prepared to negotiate. The first of ^he letters of the 4th 5f June indicates clearly where Holmes 1 sympathies lie and where he thinks the Shaikh T s should, even suggesting a possible loss of money, a very potent arguement with His Highness,should he inclined to favour American interests. The letter is interesting but is not factually correct. The second letter of the 4th of June is an intimation that P.G.L. propose to enter the arena if the games are held. The letter of the 12th of June deals more fully v/ith the transit of Basra Oil to Kuwait and forecasts the developement of Kuwait harbour. I have no record of this transit suggestion previously having been put forward. The last letter suggests that the old warrior may possibly try his hand again at the old game. Honourable Sir Geoffrey Prior, KCIE, itical Resident in the Persian O-ulf,C 0 P V, 23rd February, 1943. MILLHILL SANSON, CHS ,? rc 5FOPD, ESSST. mQ Ris Hi^bness Shaikh Sir Ahmad al -Tahir As-Subah, KCTE. C-T. Kuvait. Your Hierhness, Greetings. It is with a certain amount of diffidence that I address Your Highness on uhe subject; of the remaining Territory not allocated - of Your Highness 1 dominions outside the area'acquired by your Oil Company. I must first maKe it clear to v our Highness that I have not mentioned the subject matter of this letter to any person or 'persons in England or elsewhere. Therefore, may I suggest that no mention be made in regard to the contents herein to any of the local non-subjects. As v our Highness T representative here, I feel that it is my duty to lay before ^our Highness’ certain suggestions and views which I trust may later be of some help to 'Ypur Highness when Your Highness deems the time appropriate to deal with the area discussed below. I wish, also, to inform Your Highness that I have no intention of being an agent for any company or person desiring to acquire a concession for oil or other ineral from Your Highness. My one desire is to work for and on behalf of the interests of ^our Flighness so long as Your Highness wishes me to do so. ^he area to which this letter refers is that section of territory situated to the south of Your highness’ boundarv and which is held in joint ownership by ^our Highness and the Ruler of the adjoining Kingdom. Hereinafter referred to as the Joint Area. '^he Joint Area embraces a section of territory of~aT)proxinatelv 1,861 souare miles (English). ^he custom - in the past, when dealing with an unproved area, has been for Rulers to grant larger areas of prospective oil bearing territory to Companies v/hich are prepared to risk a considerable amount bf money to prove if it be oil bearing or not. It would be entirely inappropriate in the case of the Joint Area to grant the whole area in one concession, because the Joint Area is to^all intent and purpose proved as being oil bearing. Oil has been discovered in highly payable Quantities both on the North and South of the Joint Area. . . Th e oil bearing structures, of which there are two, in my opinion run through the Joint Area from north to south. n here is no sign - on the Joint Area - of any disturbance of tne earth’s structure, the formation of the rocks being in conformity with those to the north and south. It is well to point out to Your Highness that large areas re not necessary to success, for instance, the Bahrain concession has 156 square miles, this restricted area has proved to be Fa ^ Clent to cevelope a large yielding and prosperous oil company. 1 her, all oil won on Bahrain has come from an area of about 10 square miles. position of and the fact that the Joint Area is a proved brin’ uhere , can be no doubt as to its rich oil bearing potentialities, to kh® question as to how the Joint Area should be presented ™ applicants for the oil rights. that u- J,!? ave Prepared a map of the ”Joint Area” on a large scale so V 111 be more facile to read and to judge how best to divide the ce for developing the oil resources. joint a Should ' our Highness agree to the idea of partitioning the embacp ^ea, do 30 into four eoual parts, each of which will approximately an area of 465 square miles, and for convenience will/- 2 - will refer to the four divisions of approximately 465 souare miles as Blocics. The lon^ side of each of the Blocks being across the direction of the oil bearing structure - as marked aut on the Map - and runs east and west. ^he reason for dividing the Blocks in such manner is to ensure that each block will include an equal part across the course of the oil bearing structure which runs north and south. I would like to impress Your Highness that in the Joint Area we are discussing an area which cannot - in my opinion - fail to produce oil in large quantities. Assuming Your Highness agrees the idea of partitioning the Joint Area int»o four equal blocks, ib becomes necessary to put a price on each Block commensurate with the great prospective value of the area under discussion. I will now indicate what I consider the terms for each Block which may be reasonably demanded. The initial payment of Rupees 450,000 on each Block, to become payable within 90 days upon the signature of the concession agreement. /Is there is nothing to chose bebween the prospects and value of each individual ^lock, there is no reason why each of the four concessions should not be drawn up in identical terms. If and when the four Blocks are disposed of, the total initial payments v/ill addj/ up to P upees 1,800,000/- approximately £.135,000, not an unreasonable figure when the prospecus of the Joint Area'ane* considered. There is one point to which I wish to draw Your Highness» particular attention: v our Highness will observe that the 'map shows that all four Blocks are as near as possible of the same superficial area. In my opinion, any small difference in the superficial area of the Blocks does not affect the oil bearing portion as all Blocks are similar in this respect. If the joint awners wished to divide the Joint Area into two bnual parts and each joint owner to become full and entire owner I of one hal. o± the Joint Area, this could be done by each taking the two blocks adjacent to their respective boundaries. If such an agreement were consummated it would simplify the development and working of the oil resources, also provide complete freedom lor each to dispose of his half as desired by each Ruler. [ would be much pleased if Your Highness would let me Know when this letter reaches you. /hile the suggestions contained herein are not in any way limmediately urgent, I would lij£e Your Highness* ideas on them. I • I trust that all is well with Your Highness and Your family icrrcle. We are all well but overloaded with farm work and short of lon o for the day when we can again visit Your Highness. With good wishes, I remain, Your Highness* sincere friend and faithful servant, Sgd. Frank Holmes.Copy of letter dated the 4th June 1943 from Major Frank HolmesT Millhill,Sandon, Chelmsford. Essex, to His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabar as Subah,K.C.I.E.,C.S.I.,Kuwait. In considering to whom the Oil Concession, covering Your Highness' interest in the Neutral Zone, should eventually be granted, there are several points which it is necessary to ta^e into account apart from those pertaining to the Neutral Zone I will, with Your Highness' permission, lay before your Highness my ideas which I hope will be welcome. The first is the final designation of the Oil v/on from the Area under discussion. If the concession be given to the Gulf Oil Company ( represented by Mr. Rhoades ) in partnership with the Standard Oil Coy - the latter having the rights of His Majesty's interest tk in the Neutral Zone - there is the prospect ,as the Standard Oil Coy has a refinery near Has Tanura ( Xatif ), it follows that oil recovered from the Neutral Zone will be diverted to that refinery and Your Highness' interest - in the Oil obtained from the Neutral Zone - will be confined solely to the Royalty payable per ton on Oil won. In these circumstances it appears to me that there will certainly be a loss of control by Your Highness if the oil be pumped to Has Tanura refinery. The question of labour control in a joint company may present difficulties and divort certain charges , difficult to enumerate off-hand, but deal principally with local labour employment conditions. Your Highness may remember a discussion I had - at Hr. Skliros' instigation - with Your Highness, when last in Kuwait , dealing with the Transit Dues payable to Your Highness upon Oil brought from Basra for shipment through Kuwait Harbour. The Transit Dues payable upon such Oil would eventually provide a large sum of money each year and would continue to increase as the Oilfields of Basra Vilayet developed. In fact, the revenue from Oil in transit is without cost to Your Highness except perhaps for the salaries of two or three local men for checking , on behalf of Your Highness, the amount of Oil arriving through the pipe line at Kuwait end. In addition the Oil won from Your Highness' half of nhe Neutral Zone will no doubt pass through Kuwait Harbour. After close study of the whole position in Kuwait - in respect^of the oil development within Your Highness' Sheikhdom and tailing the rich prosoect of a constant and large revenue from transit oil from Basra - I feel confident that greater gain would ensue to Your Highness if your half interest in the Neutral Zone were placed with Mr. Skliros to develop and would give Your Highness fuller control and yield richer results than can be provided by any other applicant. tifike this statement with much confidence as no other applicant can make a 'transit dues' offer as all the Iraq Oilfields, including Basra Vilayet, are under the control of Hr. Skliros' Companies. I I have no personal interest in anyway as to who secures ^ne oil rights of territory under Your Highness' control except ^o point out what I consider would be most advantageous to the interest of Your Highness and Your people.4th Tune 1943. SANDON,CHELMSFORD. ESSEX. To His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Tabar as Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., KIT'/AIT • Your Highness Greetings. have not had the pleasure of receiving any communication from Your Highness recently. I hope that all is well with v our Highness and your people. Mr. Rhoades is now in London, he informed me that it was his intention to visit Your Highness so soon as he could secure a passage by one of the Overseas Airv/ay aeroplanes. From Mr. Rhoades’ talK I gathered that he honed to be able to discuss with you a concession agreement covering M 0 ur Highness’ nortion of the Neutral Zone, but he v;ishes, in the first niece, to conclude with Vour Highness some business with the Sulnhur Comnany. Ft. Skliros - with Your Highness’ kind permission - will also wish to renew his application for an Oil concession covering Your Highness’ half of -&amp;he Neutral 7one whenever you deem it wise to enter into such negotiations. It is very gratifying to know that I shall not - in the future - be in the oosition of a negotiator and having to reouest something from Tour Highness instead of being free to assist Your Highness and so repay, in small degree, the manifold kindnesses I have always received from Your Highness, for which I am most grateful. I an looking forward to visiting Kuwait and to forget entirely all the worries of war-time farming; although I cannot complain as our wheat ,oats and bean crops look very promising. 7ith good wishes , I remain, v our Highness’ sincere friend and grateful servant, Frank Holmes.r% 0 P Y. 12th June, 1943. MILLHILL, SANDON, CHPTJ/SFOHD. ESSEX. His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabur-As-Subah, KOIE., GSI., Kuwait. your Highness Greetings. I wrote two letters to Your Highness both of which were dated 4th ^'iine. The reason for this letter is to make clear to Your Highness the potential value - in revenue to the State of Kuwait - of ,f Transit Dues”. During my last visit to Kuwait I discussed with Your Highness the nuestion of Your Hirhness granting a transit remit right to Petroleum Concessions for conveying the oil won from the Basra concession to Kuwait; this v/ould also^call for the right to build a pipe-line to convey the oil from the Basra - Kuwait boundary to the Kuwait Harbour. '.lien I wrote on June 4th to Your Highness I was unable to give the amount of the 'Transit Dues” per ton of oil delivered to the Kuwait end of the pipe-line as I had forgotten and had to refer to Fr. Skliros, v/hich I have now done. The 'transit Dues” - -payable to Your Highness by the icompany - would be at the rate of Annas 2 (two) per ton of oil imported through Kuwait Territory from the Basra concession area. Tn order to give Your Highness some idea of the importance of such 'Transit Dues” the revenue from each one million tons of Basra Concession Oil - delivered adjacent to the Kuwait Harbour - would amount to Rupees 125,000/-(One hundred and twenty five thousand rupees). As the development of the Basra Oil Concession Area progresses it is reasonable to assume that the yearly output of oil from the rich Basra Concession Area - will increase to several million tons per annum, with a corresponding increase of Revenue to the State of Kuwait. The Transit of oil scheme from Basra is a business that must be secured for the State of Kuwait, as it presents no difficulties nor will it cause any expense to Your Highness beyond the salaries of two or three men to check - on Your Highness 1 behalf - the quantity of oil arriving at the Kuwait terminus of the pipe-line on v/hich 'transit Dues” is payable. Your Highness may have heard that the Americans have built a new river port near ^ao on the Shatt-al-Arab. T am not altogether happy about these activities on the Shatt-al-Arab, so am anxious to hear Your Highness’ ideas on the transit of oil scheme across Kuwait territory. Yhere is one thing I do not wish to wake up one morning to be told that the Basra oil is to be pumped to a Shatt-al-Arab port and thus lose to Kuwait an exceptionally fine source of revenue. Your Highness need not have any doubts that the amenities of the town of Kuwait or its surroundings shall be affected detriment ally. The pipe-line will most nrobably deliver the oil on the north shore of the Kuwait Harbour, a few miles east of Jarrah. ^here is much space to develop the necessary facilities for handling the shxnKffinfc shipment and even refining of the oil, and that area being so remote no inconvenience will be experienced by the people of Kuwait town. The Harbour of Kuwait is certainly a very rich possession and its development in the years to come will exceed expectations. T trust that Your Highness will not weary of the ideas put before Your Highness from time to time. Hy excuse is that I have only one thought in my mind and that is T desire nothing but to help, to the extent of my abilities, ann always having a deep regard for the welfare of the person of our Highness and of your oeople. One of my greatest possessions and most dear to me is the friendship/9 XII/X - 2 - friendship of Your Highness granted me during many years I am always grateful. ^ • ^ ars * u c ' V ci:- / 1)9 llC rfoim .

I am in full agreement and feel that Your Highness has made a wise decision. the Oil world are all endeavouring to secure rights over territory which gives signs of being productive. These sudden activities of oil interests - outside the British Empire - caused quite a liotle consternation among the British Oil interests in London, as such a move was entirely unexpected especially from the quarter from which the intense activities developed. In my ooinion, Your Highness acted with wisdom and vision when you decided' to postpone consideration of all such applications. Personally I was much pleased to hear of Your Highness f ideas , but it is well for me to confess to Your Highness that I hope that Your Highness’ old and tried English friends will be given an opportunity in developing whatever resources Your Highness eventually decides upon. I would much like to visit Kuwait in October or November of this year; I have no business to discuss with you and would come^purely to see Your Highness and have one or two months of Kuwait air and relaxation. So if Your Highness is agreeable to my visiting Kuwait, I would be much pleased if Your Highness , upon receipt of this letter, would Kindly send me a telegram agreeing the visit. Ye are in the midst of both our hay and grain harvest, with labour so scarce the work of garnering the corn and hay looks like an impossible feat, but no doubt we will manage it somehow or other. My wife wishes to convey, through Your Highness, her respectful greetings to Lady Ahmed. # I trust that all is well with Your Highness and your family circle and people. 7ith good wishes.&amp; \A Copy of telegram dated the 9th of July 1943 from His Highness Sir Ahmad al Jahir as Suhah, K.C•I.E*, C.S.I., Shaikh of Kuwait to Major Erank Holmes.

My dear Bridgeman, Kuwait - Ileatral Zone., I am informed that the, failure of certain recent negotiations | has not “been received with good grace by the Principals concerned, and that it is proposed to approach the matter afJresh from a different angle; the idea is that Ibn Saud should be induced to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh of Kuwait to hurry up and do something about it&lt; That is not likely to take place; there are differences between those two Rulers, but Ibn Saud is of good Arab stock, and I doubt whether, during his lifetime, whatever be the appearances, Saudi Arabia will be allayed to do much coercion on one whose father feu and shelterec Ibn Saud for many years before he carved out for himself a throne 01 nis own. v ' But be that as it may , it looks as if one must continue to watch the position with vigilance. I do not prorjose to move P.C.L. in the raatter, for the present; ai^r such premature approach could only be met by the same old interim reply that the time is not yet propitious. The Sheikh still fancies his chance for a mutually satisfactory partitioning of that Zone, he retaining tlie Hortliem half and, as tliut is probably the better half, I am content to wait until he is in full possession. In the last letter which you transmitted, from IIoltoB to tlie Siieikh, the former said that he would like to visit Kuwait if the Sheikh considered it advisable, and the latter has cabled that Holaee would be very welcome. My own deferred lino of action would be quite well served by Holmes visiting the Sheikh in his capacity of Advietr bo him in oil matters; there is no question of ny employ in olmes 05 P.C.L. negotiator, and for the present I am not aslcing for a.\vthiiv ♦ The projected visit calls for an air passage, and tlmt is where yen*you pom© in. Holmes would like to leave cad October or oarfy Itoromber, returning by tlie * end of the year. If such a thing were obtainable - assuming there is no 1.0* objection to his * wisit on political or my other ground - I think he could do wy case a bit of good by going out. to the a for the edification of rival hunters, when they isiportune hii for ot'Ji conoossions. &gt; ' Tours &lt;f:c., (3d) J.sixmos./ oi, 8 ./ x/ x • ^^ (Heceived under India office frinted Letter No.BXT.310/44 dated the 20th January 1944).

We have no objection to his visiting Kuwait and have ascertained that the Political Resident is agreeable, but we still feel it would be difficult to justify support for an application for an air passage on his btfialf.

In any case they would like to know in the first place whether the India office would be likely to favour or to object to the visit, and if the former whether there would be ary chance of an air passage. Holmes is bow an elderly man and I understand that it is doubtful whether he would be willing to travel by a less direct route.

My dear Sir Geoffrey, Please refer to your printed letter Bo.C/4 dated the 9th of April 1944 in which I am desired to give my comments on External Affairs department demi-official letter No.2431- 3/44 dated the 34th March 1944. 2. Sir Olaf Caroe's demi-official letter under reference raises two important questions. The first of these Is whether it is advisable, in view of the U.3. Government's active interest at the present time in the Persian Gulf as an oil producing area, to reopen the Saudi Arabian boundary question and endeavour to negotiate a settlement of the south-eastern frontier of that country. Such a settlement would have to preserve the terri torial rights of the Aden Protectorate chiefs, the Sultan of Muscat, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the Shaikh of ^atar, and the concession rights of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited and at the sa&amp;e time be acceptable to the Saudi Arabian Government. The second question only arises should the answer to the first be in the affirmative. It is, what would be the best method of arriving at a solution of the complex problems which have to be dealt with before a satisfactory frontier settlement could be achieved. 3. It is in my opinion correct to assume that if the United States do endeavour to bring pressure to bear to acquire additional oil concession rights on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf they will do so in those areas where the terri- torfcl sovereignty is in doubt, for any proposals on their part to obtain a footing in areas within undisputed international boundaries and for which we have already approved concessions could be and should be immediately rejected. It is also true that from the westerly base of the i^atar peninsula to the * rl -* 1unction the frontiers of the Aden Protectorate, Saudi iLwt 8lr 0# ® ffr «y Prior, K.C.I.S., oiitical Kesldent in the Persian Gulf, /Arabia Bushire.AraMa, and the lemen the actual geographical boundaries have not been determined and it is here that American pressure should be most expected. Therefore I consider that it is desirable to endeavour in the near future to reach an agreesient with the Saudi Arabian Government on this portion of their frontier. I am not altogether in accord with Sir Qlaf Caroe^ statement that the Kuwait •neutral zone*, Jebel Naksh, and the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and Muscat are political vacua. Far from it. Our difficulty has been in the past and will be in the future not a lack of political interests in these areas but a supor-abundanee of claimants desirous of including them within the territories over which they exercise control, however nebulous that control may be. Having agreed that it is necessary to reopen this very complex and controversial subject an answer must be found if possible to the second question referred to in paragraph 2 of this letter. 4 « total,t tom When dealing with this subject I must claim indulgence should I make mistakes in fact for I am writing without access to records and relying solely on memory. In 19*13 the Shaikh of Kuwait declined to negotiate with any oil company in respect o* his rights in the •neutral xone* and gave as his reason that 80 it *fas undesirable to dc^Whlle the war was In progress as any agreement which might be entered Into could not possibly be implemented until peace time conditions once again prevailed. In my epinion his real reason for refusing to negotiate was that he still hoped to be able to assert at some future date his claim to exclusive rights in the area in qucstlcn. In common with many other people he considers that on the demise of Ibn Saud Saudi Arabia will become a scene of strife between numerous aspirants to the throne of the great king and that by some political means much as assisting the ultimately /successful&amp; ^ I successful candidate he may fce able to persuade the then Saudi Arabian Government to relinquish their rights in the •neutral sone 1 in his favour. Therefore I think that it would require political support in the widest sense to influence the Shaikh to agree to grant a concession for the f neutral sone* at the present time. It will be recalled that the Arabian American Oil Company already hold a very comprehensive concession fro© Ibn Gaud for his interests in this area. (For the exact details of the agreement between the Arabian American Oil Company and Ibn Saud a reference may be made to the printed correspondence forming an enclosure to your printed letter Ho*254-2 dated the 17th ilareh 19^4 — Jedda despatch Ho.96 dated th© 25th Hovembor 1943). I believe that the Arabian American Oil Company have already come to an agreement with the Eastern Gulf Company who have a half share in the Kuwait Oil Company with regard to the joint exploration of the 'neutral son© 1 . This being so it would of course be very satisfactory for the two companies concerned* the Arabian American Oil Company and the Kuwait Oil Company* if the latter acquired the ‘neutral son © 1 concession, but I believe that we have already given an undertaking to Messrs* Petroleum Concessions Limited that should the question of the •neutral tone 1 become a subject for negotiations they will be kept informed snd be given an opportunity to negotiate. If this is indeed so it will be necessary for Hessrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited to withdraw their right to negotiate before His Majesty^ Government could authorise political support being given to the Kuwait Oil Company to obtain the concession. Whether they would do so willingly I am not In a position to say. At th© same time we are responsible that the Shaikh’s interests are safeguarded and that being so should be justified in eliminating competition by securing the withdrawal of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited? /I4. I would advlsw that we make no move whatsoever with regard to the Kuwait •neutral zone 1 for the time being for I think it unlikely* in view of the failure of the Arabian American Oil Company* after drilling 10,400 feet, to find oil at Abrak-al-Kabrit immediately south of the ’neutral zone', that the American interests will make any determined effort to secure the Shaikh of Kuwait’s interest. Should they do so however I consider we should leave the field open to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions limited and the Kuwait Oil Company, discourage all foreign competitors, and encourac® the dhaikh to give up his dreams of the future and to come to a settlement with either of them. i*ven in 1908 when our policy of appeasement was at its height and th© Foreign Office wished to acquire Khor-el-Gdeid with a view to making a present of it to Ibn S&amp;ud for some* what negative political benefits His Majesty’s Government never had the slightest doubt that Jebel Naksh belonged to the Shaikh of :atar. Th© area has been Included in Messrs. Petro leum Concessions Limited’s agreement for the ^atar peninsula, and we have on more than on© occasion clearly stated to the Saudi Arabian Government that we considered it as part of the 3h&amp;ikh of Qatar's territory. The Government of India thenselves took a very firm iru over zhe Khor-el-Odeid question, an area which in certain circles was not considered as important as Jebel flaksh, and it would be impossible for them to make any suggestion of the nature of that now put forward without indicating their willingness to acknowledge that Ibn Sand’s dale* to sovereign rights in the area was at least as good as that of the Shaikh of qatar. Such an admission on our part would amount to a rt treat from a strong position in the face of an inferior foe alter betraying our ally. /ThatThat Ilin Sand might to Inclined from a sense of gratitude for assistance rendered to him during this ear and financial assistance to to rendered to hi® In the future to relinquish his claim to Khor-el-Odeid is possible, and it is equally possible that he might to prepared to relinquish his vague claim to Jetol ft&amp;ksh. fthen dealing with Ibn Baud it Is tost to take a strong line for strength is what he understands and has used throughout his life with very considerable effect, and it should to made perfectly clear to the Saudi Arabian Government that we will never agree to acknowledge their claim to Jetol Jiaksh* I believe that sufficient pressure, possibly financial, can now be brought to bear upon Xbn Sand to obtain a settlement of the south-eastern frontier without our being forced to make any territorial concession anywhere. 6* 2M ILml&amp;l yfrftSt The statement that the whole area from Khor-el-Gdeld to dhofar, east, south-east, and south of what will be acknowledged Saudi territory is covered by concessions already granted to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited by the Sultan of Muscat and the Truclal Shaikhs is not altogether correct for the Shaikh of Fujairah has not been included in any concession agreement, and for the matter of that is not in treaty relation with ills Majesty's Government. This shaikhdoia could at one time have been considered to to linked to His Majesty's Govern ment through agreements with the Jawasim shaikhs but for many years now it has in fact toon independent of the Jawaaim. At the present time it is doubtful if either the Sultan of Muscat or the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ess-al-Khalmah, or Kalba could rightfully assert a claim to this hilly tract ruled over by a stout-hearted rogue. Fujairah is the backdoor to the Tracial Coast and should to closed with some form of simple agreement at the earliest possible moment. Once Ihn Baud has swallowed the Jebl Kaksh pill little difficulty will to experienced in persuading him to agree to a irentier line at a very considerable distance from the6 Buraiiai oasis and any dan* ©r to Abu DhaM will ba avoiiod. I doubt whothor Ibn Saud has exJUbited intarast in Duraiiai for nany yaars # if avar, it is rather that the inhabitants of the oasis have from tloe to tiae used the power of his rmaa to extract concessions from their overlords and have paid personal court to him in the hope of pecuniary reward. In the near future #e shall be called upon to give our views on and possibly to delineate the frontiers of the Iruci&amp;l Sheikhdoms. It will be a complicated and tedious business necessitating an officer on special duty with wide powers and much tacit and experience. I have no coiament to offer on Sir Olaf Caroe 1 * views with regard to the Bultanate of Muscat. V. To su Jtaarise, it is my opinion that the south-east frontier of Saudi Arabia should be agreed upon without further delay; tliafc in certain circumstances the Shaikh of Kuwait should be persuaded to agree to the openi/ig of negotiations for his rights in the ‘neutral sone* and that Messrs. Petroleum concessions Limited should be given an opportunity to compete with the nuwait Oil Company but it should be made clear to the uhaikh of Kuwait that we would not permit any other concern to taxe part in the negotiations and would expect him to reach agreement with either of the two companies named within a reasonable period of time; that we should in no way relax st-ei&amp;i we have made with regard to Jebel tfaksh or Khor-el- dheidf that agreement should be reached with the Shaikh of ~ u UrfcUij and that I agree with the views expressed regarding the Sultanate of Muscat.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence resting with my memorandum No.C/224 of the 13th April, 1946 and to say that Major Holmes informed me in conversation the other day tnat General Pyron had, during his recent visit to Kuwait, broached the question to His Highness of a concession in the Neutral Zone and also of one to cover the subsoil adjacent to the coast of Kuwait territory. 2. I asked His Highness later whether General Pyron had made any proposals with regard to the Neutral Zone and the Ruler told me that he had refused to discuss the question. I also mentioned to His Highness that I had heard that General Pyron had some experience of oil production from sea areas (in the Los Angeles - Catalina island area I believe) and asked him whether he had mentioned the possibility of boring in the subsoil beneath the sea. I did not distinguish between territorial waters or those outside territorial limits. His Highness replied, intention ally I think; vaguely that there had been some talk of the sea areas and waived it aside as of no consequence. 3. General Pyron will, I believe, be returning in the autumn and I think we should be correct in assuming that the Gulf Oil Corporation is definitely interested in the possibility of operations in the subsoil area adjacent to Kuwait territory. His Highness was, quite clearly, not anxious to discuss details of General Pyron f s conversations and I regret I was unable to obtain more detailed information of what did transpire at his meetings with the Ruler. Major Holmes informed me, for what it is worth, that he was not working for General Pyron or Mr. Hamilton but volunteered the information that they had asked him to meet them en route to Kuwait.

I know from conversations with the Shaikh that he regards a break-up of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom as a not improbable sequel to Bin Saud’s death, and I do not think it unlikely that he hopes, in that event, to establish his sovereignty over the whole of the Neutral Zone. He would then, of course, be in a position to grant a much more valuable concession. 4* If he regards the present boundaries as permanent, it is difficult to see why he has consistently refused to grant a concession although Bin Saud has done so in respect of his share of the Zone. Heines has dangled the bait before him more than once (vide his letter of 23rd February, 1943 to His Highness) and the profits ^ T in-' would The Hon’ble Lt. Col. W.R.

He may, of course, have had the idea I have suggested in the past and now be modifying it as he feels himself grov/ing older and Bin Saud still amongst the living. Hov/ever that nay be, I do not believe he would give a concession to an American concern behind on backs in view of the cor respondence that has passed. 5. In case you have not the relevant files^'with you the passage referred to in my telegram Ho.C.A.5 sent to-day reads as follows: rt Meanwhile there is no reason to apprehend that your interests may go by default.

We wish to assure you that we have not opened discussions with nor made a promise to any persen or pers ons or company or companies in connection with this subject. Certain persons had requested us to permit them to discuss the Neutral Zone,but we refused not wishing that any discussions should take place without the consent of His Majesty^ Government. In this connection we inform you that His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia has promised to grant a concession of his share of the Neutral Zone, and in view of this promise we consider it advisable to negotiajbe with any company or companies wishing to take up a concession for our share of the Neutral Zone. For the above reason we request you to be so kind a_s to inform His Majesty’s Government about this matter and to obtain their consent to enable us to open discussions with anyone coming forward, and we hope to receive a speedy and favourable reply.

Dated the Ifth October 194G Hay's telegrar ' T, 0.1057 September ££th 2. Shaikh wrote to Tandy September 25th reiterating that he has not opened discussions in spite of requests from 'certain persons' as he did not wish that any discussions should take place without consent of H.k.G. but now that he has heard that Ibn Saud 'has promised to grant a concession of his share of the Neutral Zone', he 'considers it advisable to negotiate with any Company or Companies wishing to*take up a Concession for our share of the Neutral Zone.' He has therefore asked for H.r .G 1 s consent to 'open discussions with anyone coming forward'. 3. There is some doubt in my mind* as to the actual meaning of the Shaikh's words wrhen he alleges that Ibn Saud 'has promised to grant a concession'. Read literally they do not amount to much. I suggest that Minister Jedda might be asked for any information he has on the subject. 4.

Reference paragraph 3 of your telegram. Ibn Saud in 1939 conceded to ARAMCO his oil rights in Neutral Zone (see paragraph 71 of Survey of Oil Resources of Middle East, copy forwarded under Ext.2699/45) and Sheikh must have been aware of this for a long time. 6.

He added to open discussions in such way was like trying to drive a car without first making a road for it. 3.

While you were away from Bahrain we had a telegram from our ■ .anaging Director instructing us to send Lermitte to Kuweit as early as possible, with the object of indicating Petroleum Concessions Ltd. continued interest in Kuweit’s share of the oil rights in the Neutral Zone. The Sheikh of Kuweit has been notified accordingly from London. The Managing Director directs that Lermitte should obtain early interviews with the Political Agent, Kuweit and with the Sheikh, with a view to obtaining the Sheikh 1 s conception of the value of his rights and the obliga tions he would wish to impose on the concessionaire. Lermitte is also instructed to establish a P.C.L. headquarters with the knowledge and approval of the Political urgent and the Sheikh. 2* The Managing Director ( xr. Skliros) expects to be in Iraq about the middle of November and will be contacting Lermitte and providing guidance. In this connection it will be necessary to withdraw Lermitte from Dubai where he is functioning as Liaison Officer between the Residency Agent, the Sheikhs and the Geophysicist Party on the Trucial Coast. A Mr. Jackson (of British nationality) who, it is understood, speaks Arabic fluently, is being sent to Dubai immediately to replace Lermitte. 4.

Kuwait Neutral Zone. ukliros and ,/heatXey of P.C.r. left United Kingdom on Kovenber 12th to open negotiations with bhaikh for his oil rights. Z. &lt;le understand as a result of consultations between *uiglo Iranian Oil Company and Gulf oil Corporation the partners in Kuwait Oil Company, it has been mutally agreea between the two groups that if either of them should obtain oil rights from Shaikh of Kuwait in Neutral Zone it would share them equally with the other, .uiglo Iranian Oil Company for their part however do not feel able to compete in their own name in Neutral Zone until it is definitely established whether they are still bound by red line agree ment or not. lending clarification of this point which may take some time they feel bound to confine themselves to participation in offer to be made by P.2.1. of which they are one of the member groups. Incidentally we do not repeat not feel we can rely too much on above mentioned understand ing between ^.I.C.C. and Gulf proving effective if occasion \ arises as United States Government might have contrary views. J • His Majesty’s Government attaches great importance to British interests obtaining a share of any Oil concession granted in respect of Neutral Zone and as / indicated2 , \ux indicated in my telegram Wo.18672 the apolication of P,C ' L ' as a British Company in which bhnikh and Anglo Iranian Oil Company hold substantial siiar£ is .supported on this account. It appears possible however that Company's bia will not be successful since they may well be reluctant to accept royalty terms in this area which are substantially higher than in other iiiddle East areas over which P.C.L./I.P.c. group already holds concessions. Moreover there are some indications that American groups in P.C.L. may decide to press view that red line agreement lapsed owing to war time circumstances affecting french group. We understand Standard Oil Company of New Jersey have reserved right to apply independently for rights in Keutral Zone and if they were to proceed on this line Socony Vacuum might follow suit. 4. It is therefore possible that in addition to Caltex who already hold Saudi Arabian rights in Neutral ^one Standard Oil Company of Kevi Jersey and possibly Socony Vacuum may enter field as individual American competitors of P.C.L. Gulf Oil Corporations may well also compete although they (and likewise A.I.O.C.) are likely to be restrained by consideration that success in Neutral Zone would inevitably carry with it a high royalty rate which in all probability^tht^ also have to be accepted by K.O.C. in Kuwait proper. 5. In view of possibility that P.C.L. may be unsuccessful in obtaining a share of Neutral Zone rights an informal suggestion of which Hay is aware recently made by Burma Oil Company has been encouraged by H.M.G. • They are a British concern of international repute and well equipped both financially $nd technically. They are independent of A.I.O.C. and bhaikh in their production and marketing policy outside India and Burma and are in no way(iTi) - 3 - no way involved in the I.P.C. group or red line agree- ment.

Mjb: rjLt.S h^ to Ihe struggle for an oil concession in the Kuwait Neutral Zone has been going on for over ten years between three groups, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (now Aramco) the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (owning the American interest in the Kuwait Oil Company) and P.C.L. Aramco have secured all concessionary rights in the Zone that the Government of Saudi Arabia is entitled to grant vide Articles 5, 9 and 11 of the Supplemental Agreement^ to the Saudi Arabian Concession, and as far back as 1938, indicated their wish (vide Vol. D-142,p*186) to secure a concession in the Neutral Zone in association with British interests .other than the Iraq Petroleum Company (of whom P.C.L. are a subsidiary). The Gulf Oil Corporation have made some attempts - ^ to obtain a concession, vide e.g. Sir T. Fowle*s d.o. letter N0.673-S, dated the 6th December 1938, but without success,’ owing to the Shaikh's attitude (see para. 5^ below). They Jjl too appeared to have realised that the best chance of success was by merger with British interests - the A.I.O.C. (86/13-11 p.6 para. 1). The A.I.O.C., however, apparently turned down the proposal. P.C.L. have also attempted to obtain first a concession (Vol.D-142 slip A) then a five year option (ibid p.44 ff.), also without success owing to the Shaikh'sattitude. -^hey also approached the Saudi Government in 1937 in an attempt to buy out what was then the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's option on the Neutral Zone (ibid. p. 104) but this was found impracticable (ibid, p.131) The Shaikh of Kuwaiti attitude is that as he con- siders himself entitled to all the rights in the Neutral Zone, and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies, he will not grant a concession (or option), in respect of his share of the oil rights in the Zone (Vol. D-142 p. 180 para. 7). He has consistently maintained this attitude and H.M.G. are reluctant to press him to grant any rights (86/13-ii, v p.43) P.C.L. an undertaking (*fei*. p. 67) that should he desire to reopen the negotiations he will first inform P.C.L.

This situation continues until 1946 when the Shaikh decides to begin considering offers for a neutral zone concession and invites various companies including Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, ARAMCO and the Burmah Oil Company to compete for the concession.Other matters discussed in the volume include:a proposed visit by Harold and Violet Dickson to Ibn Saud December 1938 which was eventually cancelled;a report from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda regarding discussions held between Stephen Hemsley Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Minister of Finance to the Saudi Arabian Government regarding concessions for the unalloted areas of Saudi Arabia, after which PCL concluded they were not prepared to bid for owing to the preference rights given by the Government to the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company;a visit paid by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin [Yūsuf Yāsīn] of the Saudi Arabian Government to Sir Reader Bullard, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda regarding a possible oil concession for the Kuwait-Saudi neutral zone in which the Saudi Arabian Government’s growing need for money was noted along with concerns that the Saudi Government seemed to think British and American Oil interests were conspiring against them to keep offers low.confirmation that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC) had taken up their right to a concession for all unalloted areas of Saudi Arabia, including the Saudi Arabian share of the neutral zone. The concession agreement was ratified in July 1939 and published in the Umm-al-Qura newspaper.a report of a visit made by Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson of the Kuwait Oil Company to Abraq al Kabrit [Abraq al Kibrīt] to see CASOC’s drilling operations and obtain water samples.Correspondence between Major Frank Holmes, Adviser to the Shaikh of Kuwait on Oil Matters and the Shaikh of Kuwait in which oil in the neutral zone is discussed along with possible arrangements for transit oil from Basra to pass through Kuwait and the likely financial benefits to the Shaikh of such an arrangement.discussion between the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Political Resident regarding the outstanding Saudi Arabia boundary questions and the appropriate time to address the issues. The boundary questions being discussed included the Kuwait Neutral Zone; Jebel Naksh [Nakhsh] and Khor-el-Odeid [Khawr al ‘Udayd] which Saudi Arabia had made claims to but which the British Government considered to belong to Qatar and Abu Dhabi respecitively; and the boundaries between Trucial Coast States, Muscat and Saudi Arabia and how best to draw boundary lines between them, including Saudi Arabian claims to the Baraimi [Al Buraymī] Oasis, and the British Government’s opinion that any boundary settlement needed to ensure the Baraimi Oasis remained part of Abu Dhabi territory.rumours of an intended meeting between Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait at Gaisun [Al Qayşūmah]; and further reports that the Shaikh of Kuwait, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah [ʻAbd Allāh bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah] [(brother of the Shaikh of Bahrain) and Mohammad Tabriz bin Abdul Aziz bin Saud [Muḥammad bin ʻAbd al-ʻAzīz Āl Sa‘ūd] (a son of Ibn Saud) had all been in the Gaisun area and had corresponded but that Ibn Saud had not travelled there.a request by the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) to undertake a hydrographic survey of the coast of the neutral zone in order to locate a harbour site suitable for unloading heavy equipment for the trans-Arabian pipeline, and the granting of permission by both the Saudi Arabian Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait for the work to be undertaken.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 244-263.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait-Nejd Neutral Zone</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000294#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
