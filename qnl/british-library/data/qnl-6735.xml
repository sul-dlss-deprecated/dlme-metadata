It did not * appear likely that any surplus would he available in the near future unless the ceded revenues were augmented by an increase of the Turkish customs, nor was it probable that the Turkish Government would he induced without the greatest difficulty to pledge other revenues for the benefit of the railway. The Turkish Ambassador in London had in November 1908 intimated to His Majesty’s Government the Porte’s desire to raise the Turkish [216] B2 customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent., and he had been informed that the assent of His Majesty’s Government to that course would only be given if they received an undertaking that the proceeds of the increase were not devoted to any existing enterprise. This undertaking, Itifaat Rifasrt Pasha, Pasha said, his Government was prepared to 1908 . give. The questions of the customs increase and of the Bagdad Bailway had become indissolubly bound up together owing to the lien on the surplus of the ceded revenues secured by the Bagdad Bailway Company. When, therefore, it became evident that the Turkish Government would shortly apply officially for the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the increase of the duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent., and as there appeared to be no intention on the part of Germany to invite British participation in any form in the railway, it became a question whether it would not be necessary to use the customs increase as a lever with which, if possible, to bring about a solution of the Bagdad Bailway question satisfactory to His Majesty’s Govern ment. The first idea was that failing the attain ment of a satisfactory solution, such as partici- Tigris Valley Kailwav pation in the Bagdad Bailway Concession by securing in British hands the construction and management of the Gulf section of the railway, His Majesty’s Government should only accept the proposed customs increase if they should receive a Concession for a railway from the Persian Gulf to Bussorah and Bagdad along the valley of the Tigris, with the option to prolong it along the valley of the Euphrates to Tripoli or some other port on the Mediterranean; the construction of such a line to be carried out without any Turkish kilometric guarantee. This condition was, of course, to be additional to that already formulated, that the proceeds of the increase should pass to the Turkish Exchequer, and be kept free from any existing lien. At the end of May an official request was Djavad Bej, received from the Turkish Government for 27,1909 ‘ His Majesty’s Government’s assent to the increase by 4 per cent, of the Turkish customs duties. The Turkish Charge d’Affaires’ note alluded to the financial difficulties of his Government, from which relief could only be found by the proposed measure; alluded to the undertaking already3 Euphrates Valley Railway. Sir G. Lowther, No. 375, May 25, 1909. given by the Turkish Ambassador that the proceeds of the increase would he kept free from any existing lien ; and stated that the German and Austrian Governments had already assented to the increase. * At the same time a despatch was received from Sir G. Lowther, enclosing a report from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad, in which the latter advocated, as the most important desideratum of British policy in Mesopotamia and the adjacent regions, tbe acquisition of a Concession for a railway directly connecting: Bagdad with the Mediterranean at xYlexandretta via the Euphrates Valley and Aleppo. Colonel Ramsay pointed out that the financial regenera tion of Turkey is dependent on the development of Mesopotamia; that the progress of that region is held hack by the deficient means of communi cation ; and that irrigation in Mesopotamia and development of railways must go hand in hand together. Assuming that the Bagdad Railway would some day he built along the trace of 1903, and viewing the matter from the purely commercial point of view, Colonel Ramsay argued that a railway in British hands up the Euphrates Valley from Bagrdad to the Mediterranean through Aleppo would furnish the best means of protecting British interests in Mesopotamia against foreign competition. The railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf he regarded as important, but less important than the line to the Mediterranean. He regarded it as most urgent that the Turkish Government should retain freedom of action and equality of rates for all parties on the Aleppo- Alexandretta section, pointing out that if the German Bagdad Railway Company were to secure control of this section they could, by imposing maximum rates on goods reaching Aleppo via the Euphrates line, nullify all the advantage the latter would obtain over the Bagdad line by means of its shorter length. On this point Sir G. Lowther in his covering despatch, wrote :— “ I am not convinced that this apprehension is well grounded. The German Company possesses its preference for the line con necting Aleppo with the sea only on con dition that the prior similar rights of the Damascus-Hamah-Biredjik Railway are respected (see Young’s “ Corps de Droit4 Ottoman,” vol. iv, pp. 166-7 and 228). Now, supposing the French Company is willing to cede its right, it seems to me certain that whatever other conditions they may attach to the Agreement, they would certainly stipulate for favourable treatment in tariff matters for themselves, and in such case it is hard to conceive that the Turkish Government would not insist on equally favourable treatment for any railway starting from Aleppo for which they might grant a Concession. Thus, though no doubt serious, I doubt whether the competition of the Bagdad Railway would be as formidable as Colonel Ramsay anticipates, especially when the advantage w r hich the Euphrates Valley line would possess in its shorter route is taken into account.” Sir G. Lowther, however, recognized how desir able it was that the Aleppo-Alexandretta section should be in more friendly hands than those of the Bagdad Railway Company, and he also pointed to the fact that the French houses interested in Turkish railways do not always adopt the policy advocated by the French Government. There were thus three alternative schemes towards the attainments of which His Majesty’s Government might turn their endeavours :— 1. Participation in the existing Concession in such a manner as to secure to Great Britain the construction and control of the Gulf section of the railway up to Bagdad, and if possible further north to Mosul. 2. The construction of a railway from the Persian Gulf to Bagdad via the Tigris, if neces sary in competition with the German line; with the option of extending the railway up the Euphrates Valley to the Mediterranean Sea. 3. The scheme advocated bv Colonel Ramsav, which w'as really an inversion of 2, viz., the construction of a railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo, and by the Euphrates River to Bagdad ; with the possibility of extending it southwards to the Persian Gulf as a matter of less urgent importance. The Mesopotamian Railways Committee was Mesopotamian assembled to consider these alternative proposals, mitt^fteport and their Report, dated the 24th July, is annexed July 24,1909.to this Memorandum. The following extract shows the procedure which they recommended:— “ After careful consideration, we recommend that the Turkish Government should be approached for— “ (i-) A Concession for a railway between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorak and the Tigris Valley, in competition, should that be found necessary, witli the present German Concession ; the British Concession to be without any financial guarantee from the Turkish Government, and the concessionnaires to have the first option of prolonging the railway subse quently along the Euphrates Valley to the Mediterranean, should the development of irrigation and trade render such a course desirable. . “ (ii.) An undertaking that, in the event of a group of British financiers, formed wdth Government approval, being able to come to terms with the present German conces sionnaires for participation in the existing Concession by the construction and control of the Bussorah - Bagdad section, the Turkish Government would abrogate in their favour Article 29 of the Concession, which prohibits any construction or working of the section southward of Bagdad until the railway has reached that city from the north. The Turkish Govern ment should be requested to undertake, at the same time, not to abrogate Article 29 under any circumstances other than those specified above. “ We recommend that these proposals should he put before the Turkish Government as soon as possible, and before any reply is given as to the desired increase of customs duties: but that the two matters should be kept distinct, a favourable reply from the Turkish Government in regard to the railway proposals not being made pre requisite to the sanction by His Majesty’s Government of the increase of duties.” The proposal to dissociate the. question of Railway Concessions from that of the customs increase could not be accepted without careful consideration. It w r as not easy to see how the [216] % C6 construction of the Bagdad Railway without British participation could be guarded against unless advantage were taken of such oppor tunities as the increase of the customs duties might offer for making conditions. Even if the proceeds of the increase were not devoted to kilometric guarantees, might they not serve merely to release other revenues for that purpose ? In favour of the proposal it could be urged that to connect the customs increase with the demand for a Rail wav Concession would be dangerous unless His Majesty’s Government were prepared to insist to the last upon the Concession being granted. By such insistence His Majesty’s Government might be placed in an invidious position, and be made to bear the odium of refusing to the new regime in Turkey, for selfish reasons, the means by which the country hoped to regenerate the national finances. On the other hand, if His Majesty’s Government were to dissociate the two matters, and while accepting the customs increase on easy terms, were to offer to build the Bagdad-Gulf Railway without any guarantee, if necessary in com petition with the German line, such action would incite the Porte to make endeavours to obtain relief from the onerous conditions of the Railway Convention of 1903, and might at the same time predispose the German Company to admit British participation in their Concession. It was decided to separate the two questions of customs increase and Railway Concessions, and Sir G. Lowther was instructed to apply to the Turkish Government for a Concession for a railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf via Bussorah and the Tigris Valley, the Con cession to be without any financial guarantee from the Turkish Government, and the conces- sionnaires to have the first option of prolonging the railway along the valley of the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, should the development of irrigation and trade render such a course desirable. After some delay caused by Cabinet changes in Turkey, Sir G. Lowther carried out his instructions in conversation with the Grand Vizier. His Highness expressed himself as per sonally favourable to the proposal, and said he would confidentially consult his colleagues He pointed out that the grant of such a Concession To Sir G. Lowther, No. 245, August 18, 1909. Sir G. Lowther, No. 746, Secret, September 14, 1909.7 Tewfik Pasha, September 14, 1909. To Tewfik Pasha, September 23, 1909. Customs increase. Conditions of His Majesty’s Government’s assent. would be deeply resented by Germany, and that Turkey would have to rely more than ever on Great Britain to help her out of such difficulties. On the same day the Turkish Ambassador in London communicated to the Secretary of State a Memorandum again pressing His Majesty’s Government to assent to the proposed increase of the customs duties. The Memorandum described the urgent necessity under which the Turkish Government found themselves of in creasing their revenues and the various schemes of reforms to which those revenues were to be devoted. It also contained the following as- surance:— “ II est bien entendu que les sommes provenant de cette maj oration ne seront point affectees a des entreprises dans lesquelles le Gouvernement Imperial se trouve deja engage, et nommement au Chemin de Ter de Bagdad.” The Memorandum handed to Tewfik Pasha, in reply, stated clearly the terms on which His Majesty’s Government would consent to the proposed increase. These were:— 1. Removal of restrictions on the borrowing O powers of Egypt. 2. With respect to the Bagdad Railway, the following statement was made :— “His Majesty’s Government take note of the undertaking given by the Ottoman Government that, in the event of their assent being given to the levy of an additional 4 per cent, import duty on British trade, the proceeds of this surtax will not be devoted to the Bagdad Rail way. They are, however, of opinion that, in order to render this pledge effective, it will be necessary that the Sublime Porte should obtain from the German Government an assurance of their willing ness to waive their right to any of the proceeds from the customs increase for the sections of the Bagdad Railway now in course of construction or to be con structed in the future. A confidential communication to His Majesty’s Govern ment, that an assurance in this sense had been given by the German Government, would remove one of the principal objec ts8 tions of His Majesty’s Government to the proposed increase, and make it clear that the political promise given by the Porte would not subsequently embarrass rela tions with Germany.” 3. If a loan were raised on the proceeds of the increase, at least one-third of it should be placed on the London market, the conditions being equally favourable with those offered elsewhere. The Secretary of State at the same time made some remarks to the Ambassador on the subject of Concessions in Turkey :— “ I said at the same time that I was anxious to draw his ^Excellency’s serious attention to some other points of considerable im portance, in addition to those mentioned in the Memorandum. His Excellency would recognize that under the old regime British trade and enterprise in Turkey had met with marked hostility on the part of the Palace. Since the institution of the new regime requests for Concessions for railways, for navigation, and for working petroleum had been submitted to the Sublime Porte by His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople without the imposition of terms which could in any way be regarded as onerous or disadvantageous to Turkey. The Ottoman Government had in this manner an opportunity of repairing the injustice inflicted on British trade in the past, and, in view of the support which His Majesty's Government had given to the new regime from the very first, and especially during the crisis of the past winter, they hoped that this opportunity would not be lost, and that the Ottoman Government would now be able to grant some reciprocity of treatment. I added that the adoption bv the Porte of i. %/ a favourable attitude towards these matters would have considerable influence with His Majesty’s Government in their eventual decision on the question of the 4 per cent, increase.” To Sir G. Lowther, No. 298, September 23, 1909. Sir G. Lowther was authorized to discuss the question of the customs duties on the lines ofSir A. Nicolson, No. 610, November 16. 1909. Sir G. Lowther, No. 849, October 15, 1909. the Memorandum and of the verbal statement made to the Turkish Ambassador. Meanwhile there were signs that the Turkish Government had been impressed by the British application to build an independent railway from the Persian Gulf to Bagdad. The Grand Vizier complained of the expense of the Bagdad Bailway to the Turkish Exchequer, and talked of having only a narrow-gauge line built. He expressed himself in favour of an arrangement being come to between the Germans and the English for the construction of the remaining sections, and said he had instructed Mahmoud Shefket Pasha to approach the German Ambassador on the subject. M. Isvolsky at a later date communicated to Sir A. Nicolson some information he had received, to the effect that Hilmi Pasha had really not been favourably impressed by the British project, though he admitt- d that it would probably he pleasing to the Turkish Parliament, in view of the fact that no guarantees were required. He had, in order to block an exclusively British project, suggested to the German Ambassador whether the German Railway Company would not be disposed to form a combination for the last section of the railway with French and English concessionnaires. Baron Marschall said that he had no objection to such a combination, provided that no further difficulties were raised in regard to the Boulgourlou-Hilif section. He would be prepared in such circumstances to recommend the combination which ITilmi Pasha suggested. In October Sir W. Willcoeks arrived in Con stantinople-from Mesopotamia, and, in an official report to the Minister of Public Works, advocated in the strongest terms the construction of a railway from Bagdad to Hit, Damascus, and * Tripoli as the best means of developing Meso potamia. On reaching London later on he explained his views and reasons for advocating the Hit line to Sir C. Hardinge, and, though 11 is Majesty’s Government saw no reason to alter the attitude they had adopted in the matter two months earlier, it is possible that Sir W. Willcocks’ strong support of this project may have disposed the Bagdad Railway Company to British participation by presenting to them the possibility that His Majesty’s Government might be compelled to throw their whole weight into the Hit line. [216] D ,3 ?\ 10 While in Constantinople, Sir W. Willcocks informed the Turkish Government in writing that the irrigation works proposed in Mesopotamia might in five or ten years’ time have the result of making the Euphrates and Tigris rivers non- navigable. This statement had a serious effect on the Lynch negotiations then pending, and the possibility contemplated made it the more urgent for His Majesty’s Government to secure adequate participation in the railway schemes of Meso potamia. On the 31st October the Grand Vizier informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that the Germans were willing to admit British participation “on the basis of equality of representation on the Board,” and a week later Dr. Gwinner approached Sir H. Babington Smith, stating that his Company would welcome British co-operation on the basis of British control, and construction of the Gulf section. At Dr. Gwinner’s request, Mr. Whittall pro ceeded to London to try to induce Sir E. Cassel to come to some arrangement with the German Company, and Sir H. Babington Smith had a con versation with Dr. Gwinner, in which the latter stated that he was prepared to agree that the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section of the railway should be under British control. The precise nature of Dr. Gwinner’s offer was not known to His Majesty’s Government till the end of the year, when Sir E. Cassel, after interviews with him at Berlin, communicated a Memorandum stating the conditions on which the Bagdad Railway Company would admit of British participation in the enterprise. Dr. Gwinner’s proposals w r ere essentially as follows :— 1. That the provisions of the existing Bagdad Railway should be maintained practically unaltered. 2. That a new Company, in which Great Britain should have a 50 per cent, interest, should be formed for the construction and working of the Gulf section. An interest of 30 per cent, was reserved for the Bagdad Railway Company, 10 per cent, for the Anatolian Railway Company, and 10 per cent, for the Turkish Government. 3.

Dr. Gwinner stated that it was the wish of the Grand Vizier that British participation should not exceed 50 per cent., and that the Bagdad Railway Company would not object to Great Britain having a preponderating influence. He also said that he had verbally informed the Turkish Government that his Company would not insist on the application of the proceeds of the 4 per cent, increase to kilometric guarantees beyond series 2 and 3 (i.e., as far as Hilif). Negotiations with Germany, Russia, and France. Germany. No negotiations have taken place with the German Government during ]909 about British participation in the Bagdad Railway ; but in a discussion of the general relations of Germany and England the Secretary of State took the opportunity of explaining to the German Ambassador why His Majesty’s Government were unable to assent to the increase of the Turkish customs duties without a promise that the proceeds would not be devoted to the Bagdad Rail wav. “ About one-third of the increase of the duties would fall on British commerce, and this in itself would be much disliked. But if the money thus secured at the expense of British trade was to be used to make a new through-route to the East and to establish means of communication which would supersede all others in carrying trade from the Persian Gulf into Mesopotamia, and all this under the exclusive control of one foreign Power, then the position of a British Government which had agreed to this would become untenable. It was therefore impossible for us to agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties unless we had proper safeguards against the use of the additional revenue for the purpose of12 displacing British trade in Mesopotamia. We felt that we must either have a part in the Bagdad Railway itself, or else we must have a Concession which would enable us to establish other means of communication bv which we could trade with Mesopotamia on equal terms. * * “ I told Count Metternich that my object in giving these explanations to the German Government was to prove to them that our action was not dictated by ill-will to Germany, but by the necessities of the case, and that the attitude we were obliged to take up with regard to the increase of the Turkish customs duties was not an attitude taken up behind the back of the German Government in a wav to cause irritation and introduce friction into what we hoped would be a friendly discussion.” The Secretary of State pointed out that one of the difficulties in the way of a settlement, w r as that Russian as well as French co-operation must be invited. “ As regards Russia, the position was this: We had on previous occasions been instrumental, or been supposed to be instrumental, in defeating the Russian plans for securing outlets on the sea, first in the case of the Mediterranean, and then in the case of the Far East; this had caused much ill-will in Russia towards us. Now we had succeeded in over coming this ill-will, and I was very anxious not to revive it as regards the one remaining outlet which Russia was thought to desire—the Persian Gulf— by participating in the Bagdad Railway, when Russia was opposed to it and excluded from it. I had told the Russian Government more than once that I thought they ought not to oppose, in principle, the construction of the Bagdad Railway, but ought instead to make up their minds as to the terms on which they could join in the project. I did not think it would be impossible for the German Government to overcome this difficulty of04 Sir E. Goschen, December 15, 1909. Russian opposition ; indeed, I knew that before the visit of the German Emperor to this country Herr von Schoen had spoken to the Russian Government on the subject. ,, During Sir E. Cassel’s visit to Berlin to meet Dr. Gwinner and discuss a scheme of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, Herr von Schoen referred to the question in conversation with Sir E. Goschen. “ He said that he would speak to me quite frankly and loyally upon this subject. It was quite possible that Sir E. Cassel and Herr Gwinner might come to a satisfactory agreement, as far as the commercial interests involved in the question was concerned, hut, as he would have me to understand, it did not follow that the Imperial Government would see their way to confirming such an Agree ment, at all events at once. He did not wish me to think that the Government had any objection to British participation, because that was by no means the case. But public opinion in Germany would be up in arms and make things very un pleasant for the Imperial Government unless the latter could show that there was some return tor what they would certainly regard as a Concession. The so- called Lynch monopoly wculd add fuel to the flame, and there would certainly be a universal cry that German interests were being sacrificed with nothing to show on the credit side of the account.” To Sir E. ^ In replying to this despatch, His Majesty’s January' 10,° 19i 0 . Government took strong exception to some of the views expressed by Herr von Schoen. Sir E. Goschen was instructed to point out that the advances in the matter of British participation had proceeded from the German side, and that— “ the suggestion that the German Government regard British participation in the light of a Concession, and that some quid pro quo will he required from the British Govern ment in return, in order to make the arrangement acceptable to the German people, is one which His Majesty’s Government cannot entertain. [216] E14 “ His Majesty’s Government consider that any advantages which may accrue to them from participation in the railway will be more than equally shared by Germany, especially when it is remembered that the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the increase of the Turkish customs duties by 4 per cent, would follow upon the conclusion of an Agreement, thus imposing for the advantage of the Bagdad Railway, which has a lien upon the customs revenue, an additional burden upon the foreign trade of Turkey, of which such a large proportion is British. * # # “ It is also to be observed that the contem plated participation of British interests in the Bagdad Railway is not an advantage additional to the Lynch Concession, but may possibly impair that Concession, and at any rate will be in the same region. Even if the new T Lynch Concession were granted and a participation of British interests in the Bagdad Railway admitted, Great Britain w r ould only have a con trolling interest in means of communi cation in which this countrv has for a long time had a vested interest through the Lynch steamers. Nothing more wil] have been accomplished than what will have been essential to prevent that long- established interest from being crushed out by new r developments.” Russia. On the 15th November the Report of Sir H. Babington Smith’s conversation wuth Dr. Gwinner was received in London,and on the 18th November His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh was instructed by telegraph to communicate its substance to the Russian Government, and to ascertain their views as to participation in the Bagdad Railway. In the telegraphic corre spondence which now ensued the action and view r s of His Majesty’s Government were made clear to M. Isvolsky. He w r as informed that no negotiations had as yet proceeded wdth r To Sir A. Nicolson, No. 1334, Telegraphic, November 18, 1909.15 To Sir A. Nicoi- aon, No. 1340, Telegraphic, November 23; No. 1343, Telegraphic, November 26, 1909. Sir A. Nicolson, No. 494, Telegraphic, November 19; No. 495.

M. Isvolsky was informed that the British group had pressed to have control of the Khanikin branch as well, but that His Majesty’s Government had con sidered Russian interests involved, and had refrained from supporting the proposal. It was obvious that the Bagdad Kail way would be built, with or without British and Ptussian co-operation, and a decision was urgent ; meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government were in ignorance of Russia’s views as to participation. Though His Majesty’s Government would certainly raise no objection to negotiations between Russia and Germany as to participation in the railway north of Bagdad, they trusted the Russian Government would keep them informed of their progress, and they could not remain indifferent if any Concessions were made by Russia to Germany in the neutral zone of Persia. M. Isvolsky’s first impression was distinctly unfavourable, but he was brought to recognize the loyalty of His Majesty’s Government in the matter, and to view the matter in a calmer and more rational spirit. On the 28th November Sir A. Nicolson wrote as follows:— “ His present attitude may be summarized as follows : He considers that the proposals of M. Gwinner constitute |an entirely new departure; he does not question the right of the British group or of His Majesty’s Government to accept them, and he expects that eventually they will do so ; he fully appreciates the loyalty of His Majesty’s Government in so promptly informing him of the proposals, and of abstaining from accepting immediately proposals which are so eminently satis- factory to British interests. He regards16 an arrangement between England and Germany on the basis of the proposals of M. Gwinner as dispelling any expectation that the Bagdad Railway wdll be discussed between Germany, England, France, and Russia. It will necessarily amount to an arrangement between Germany and England, by which the latter will secure for herself the southern section, and in return abandon all interest in the line to the north of Bagdad. In these circum stances he considers that Russia will be left alone to discuss matters with Germany so far as Russian interests are concerned. These interests he regards, from the political, strategical, and economical points of view, as of great importance ; and he is of opinion that Russia will enter into negotiations with her hands much weakened. Had he been able to have the continuation of British co operation in these negotiations he would be more hopeful of their success. France, he considers, is already in a sense a partner in the Bagdad Railway, and, moreover, her interests in the project are small in comparison with those of Russia. He has at present, so far as I have been able to ascertain, no definite views as to the basis on which he would endeavour to obtain a Russian participation in the railway. I do not think that he so much desires an actual participation in the railway ; he rather wishes to assure himself that Germany will not endeavour to push railway enterprise in those portions of Persia in which Russia possesses direct and immediate interests. In w r hat manner he may secure such assurances he is not at present very clear, but he is w^ell aware that in order to do so he wdll probably be obliged to offer Germany a quid pro quo. Of what character such a quid pro quo will be he does not know, nor is he decided as to the quarter in which he could find it. I do not think that he w 7 ould consider himself precluded from seeking it in the neutral zone of Persia, but he will keep His Majesty’s Government informed of the progress of his negotiations with Germany whenever they may be com-Sir A. Nicolson, No. 677, December 27, 1909. Sir A. Nicolson, No. 632, December 1,1909. To Sir F. Bertie, No. 743, Telegraphic, December 30, 1909. menced. Personally, I doubt if M. Isvolsky would be inclined to admit Germany into the neutral zone of Persia.” M. Isvolsky’s policy with regard to the Bagdad Railway has always been a negative one ; and it is easy to understand how difficult it must be for him to state in what manner the Bussian Govern ment would partieipate in a railway the con struction of which they would prefer to see indefinitely postponed. The reply of the Russian Government to Sir A. Nicolson’s inquiries as to their views brought matters no further forward. It did, however, contain assurances that His Majesty’s Government would be kept informed of the course of negotiations with Germany, and that the Anglo-Russian Convention with regard to Persia would be strictly observed. Unable to formulate any scheme providing for Russian participation in the railway, and fearing that a settlement of the Bagdad Railwav question in which Russia received nothing would react unfavourably on the national prestige, on his own position, and on the Anglo-Russian entente, M. Isvolsky expressed the desire to come to some understanding with His Majesty’s Government over railways in Persia, providing for the possibility of linking up the Russian and Indian railway systems, or at any rate, for earmarking Concessions for railways with that object. His views on this point, however, have not yet been fully developed, and tiie idea is still being examined by the British and Indian Governments. The position at the end of the year, and the course of action which His Majesty's Government contemplated adopting was stated in telegrams to Sir F. Bertie and Sir A. Nicolson as follows : — “As far as we are concerned, position is as follows : Gwinner’s overtures led to negotiations with Cassel, which may result, but have not yet resulted definitely, in an offer to British financiers of assured control of construction and working of railway from Bagdad to Gulf. “ When financiers agree, His Majesty’s Govern ment will have to consider whether arrangement proposed would justify them in agreeing to increase of Turkish customs dues without condition. I should then let French and Russian Governments [ 216 ] F18 know what the agreement between financiers was and what was our opinion of it before taking any step. It would then be for French and Russian Govern ments to let us know what conditions as regards Bagdad Railway would ensure their consent to increase of Turkish customs dues, so that we may all act • together. “ Questions of internationalization and of any Concession of parts of railway north of Bagdad have not come at all into negotiations between British and German financiers, and we should await views of French and Russian Governments as to how these points should be dealt with before raising them. Essential point for us is to ensure that railway from Bagdad to Gulf does not pass into foreign hands, though British financiers had expressed to me desire to secure interest in Khanikin branch also. “ Assuming that terms agreed between Cassel and Gwinner are found satisfactory by His Majesty’s Government on this point, it would still remain to be ascertained whether German and Turkish Govern ments would agree about them. No negotiations have as yet taken place between us and German Government about Gwinner’s proposals, and we assume only that German Government know of them.” France. The French Government were kept fully in formed of all the negotiations which passed with Russia, and the views and intentions of His Majesty’s Government as explained to M. Isvol- sky, were all communicated to them. From the first M. Pichon expressed himself as well satisfied at the prospects of a settlement which Hr. Gwin- ner’s action presented. He informed Sir F. Bertie that he fully recognized the necessity for Great Britain to secure her political and commercial interests in the Persian Gulf by acquiring control of the southern section of the railway, but that French public opinion would certainly require that France should receive some quid pro quo for her consent to such an arrangement, and that Sir F. Bertie, No. 455, November 20, 1909. Sir F. Bertie, No. 470, December 1,1909.“ Times,” December 29, 1909 [47321]. To Sir F. Bertie, No. 38, January 22, 1910. he would study what form of compensation would be most suitable. On the 27th December M. Pichon took an opportunity to explain to the Drench Chamber the attitude of the French Government. A deputy (M. Constant) quoted the words of M. Del- easse in 1902 : “ If a solution had been found in virtue of which the Russian element would be at complete liberty to participate in the enterprise, and by virtue of which the French element would possess, as regards the construction, working, and general direction of the line, a share in all respects equal to that of the most favoured nation, I ask the House whether a solution of this kind would Dot be one upon which we should have reason to congratulate ourselves.” Asked by M. Con stant whether he would associate himself with this statement, M. Pichon immediately replied, &lt;( Certainly ; I make these declarations my own, and I include the British as well as the Russians.” He went on to say that the French Government always had been and still were in favour of inter nationalizing the Bagdad Railway; that the recent formation of a syndicate in Switzerland to continue the construction of the railway beyond Boulgourlou, as well as the participation of the Ottoman Bank in the enterprise was without the sanction of the French Government, who looked for a settlement of the whole question on the basis of an equitable co-operation of the various States concerned. On the 13th January the French Ambassador, who had had conversations with M. Pichon in Paris, communicated the views of the French Government as to participation. M. Pichon fore saw that there would be great difficulty in obtaining Turkish assent to British control of the Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway, and was therefore in favour of internationalization of the whole line. He realized, however, that this scheme offered but few attractions to His Majesty’s Government, and in the event of their adhering to the present project, he had decided that the French Government would demand— 1. Facilities for the junction of the Syrian Railway with the Bagdad Railway. 2. The restitution to the French Syrian Rail ways of certain rights abandoned by them to the Bagdad Railway Company. 3. A Concession for the railway from Bagdad20 to Homs and the Mediterranean ; this demand to be absolutely essential. The Ambassador also said that an Anglo-French group, including Sir E. Cassel, was being formed to finance irrigation in Mesopotamia, and that it was proposed that British and French capital should finance the Bagdad-Homs line. Foreign Office, January 28, 1910.' 4 ^ 21 ANNEX. Report of the Mesopotamian Raihvays Committee. Sir, Foreign Office, July 24, 1909. WE were directed by you— “ To reconsider the answer to be given to the Turkish Government to their request for an increase of the customs dues from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, in the light of further information received from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad in connection with a proposed concession for a railway from the Mediterranean to Bagdad and Bussorah.’ In addition to the draft despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and his despatch of the 25th May, 1909, covering the despatch of the 10th March. 1909, from Mr. Consul-General Ramsay, in which the proposal for a Euphrates valley railway is put forward, we have had the advantage of seeing two unofficial letters addressed to Sir C. Hardinge, the first from Sir G. Lowther, containing some observations on the draft despatch, and the second from Sir Adam Block. In the draft despatch to Sir G. Lowther it was proposed (a) to insist upon the point that, whilst His Majesty’s Government have every desire to see an improvement in Turkish administration, and realise that this can be attained only if increased revenues are procured, the proposed increase in the customs duties would be borne in greater part by British trade ; and (b) to inform the Turkish Government that His Majesty’s Government would therefore agree to the proposed increase only on condition either of participation in the Bagdad-Bussorah section of the Bagdad Railway, or alternatively of a concession for a separate line between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorah and the Tigris valley, with the option of prolonging it along the Euphrates valley to Tripoli or some other port upon the Mediterranean, the construction of such a line to be carried out without any kilometric guarantee from the Turkish Government. In view of the despatch already mentioned from Sir G. Lowther, and the despatch from Mr. Consul-General Ramsay which it covered, it has been suggested that the order of the alternative condition to be imposed by His Majesty’s Government should be inverted ; that is to say, that the condition should be a concession for a line from Alexandretta to Bagdad, with either participation in the present German concession from Bagdad to Bussorah or the continuation of the line by an independent route to the Persian Gulf. . * The financial and commercial prospects of the three alternative railway proposals, and their relative importance to British and Indian trade, are examined in a memorandum prepared by the representatives of the Board of Trade upon the Committee and appended to this report; and we are in entire agreement with the conclusions reached in that memorandum. In our opinion, a railway from Alexandretta to Bagdad by way of the Euphrates valley, though of some use to British (but not to Indianj trade, must for a considerable number of years be of value chiefly for political and strategical purposes, the advantages of which will accrue mainly to the lurkish Government, although the construction and management of the line may to some extent serve to maintain the prestige of the British Government in the Turkish Empire. M e have grave doubt whether such a railway would be financially remunerative for many years to come ; and if it were continued to the sea, either by the route ol the German concession or by an alternative route, the section between Alexandretta and Bagdad would, we think, be likely to be for a long time a drag upon the prosperity of the undertaking. , i v .• On the other hand, all the available evidence goes to show that a line irom Bussorah to Bagdad would in all probability speedily become financially remunerative, and would certainly be at once of great use to the trade of both the United Kingdom and India. The success of tiro competing lines between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad is more problematical, and we believe that, should the present German concession be * See Appendix, p. 23. [ 216 ] G 143 *22 maintained, a British line might be gravely handicapped—first, by the fact that it would have to pass through districts in which less traffic would be available ; and, secondly, by the absence of any independent continuations northwards of Bagdad, and into Persia. Nevertheless it seems probable that a concession, even if a competitive one, from Bussorah to Bagdad would be of more value than a concession from Alexandretta to Bagdad—the latter, it must also be remembered, might be handicapped by the claims of the German concessionnaires in virtue of their reversionary rights, under article 12 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, in regard to the con struction of a branch line to the Mediterranean between Mersina and Tripoli. We are therefore of opinion that, from every point of view (1) a concession for a railway between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorah would be more desirable, and, so far as relates to the enlistment of capital, more practicable than a concession loi a line starting from Aleppo or Alexandretta ; and (2) so far as the Bussorah—Bagdad region is concerned, participation in the existing German concession would be more valuable than a concession for the construction of an independent line. To this extent, then, we are strongly inclined to favour the proposals contained in the original draft despatch to bir G. Lowther, in preference to the alternative suggested as the result of Mr. Consul-General Ramsay’s scheme. Your Committee observe that both Sir G. Lowther and Sir Adam Block are of opinion that it would be undesirable to connect—at least, formally—any demand for railway facilities with the approval by His Majesty’s Government of the proposed increase of the iurkish customs duties. It is not within our province to consider what other conditions, if any, might be imposed ; but we are disposed to think that it would, on the whole, be inadvisable for His Majesty’s Government to make their consent to the increase of the customs duties conditional upon the grant of any railway concession unless they are prepared to insist upon that condition being fulfilled. After careful consideration, we recommend that the Turkish Government should be approached for— (i.) A concession for a railway between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad via Bussorah and the ligris valley, in competition, should that he found necessary, with the present German concession ; the British concession to be without any financial guarantee from the Turkish Government, and the concessionnaires to have the first option of prolonging the railway subsequently along the Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, should the development of irrigation and trade render such a course desirable. • un( ^ erta ^ n S in the event of a group of British financiers, formed with Government approval, being able to come to terms with the present German concessionaires for participation in the existing concession by the construction and control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section, the Turkish Government would abrogate in their favour article 29 of the concession, which prohibits any construction or working of the section southward of Bagdad until the railway has reached that city from the north. The Turkish Government should be requested to undertake, at the same time, not to abrogate article 29 under any circumstances other than those specified above. We recommend that these proposals should be put before the Turkish Government as soon as possible, and before any reply is given as to the desired increase of customs duties ; but that the two matters should be kept distinct, a favourable reply from the Turkish Government in regard to the railway proposals not being made pre-requisite to the sanction by His Majesty’s Government of the increase of duties. \\ e understand that His Majesty’s Government would be willing to guarantee a reasonable rate of interest on the capital invested by any British syndicate which might be formed ; and, as we have already indicated, we do not think that the guarantee would long be necessary. We have reason to believe that, under these circumstances, no serious difficulty would be encountered in the formation of a British syndicate. We believe that the prospect of a rapid completion of the railway, with the additional prosperity wdiich would follow, would be a strong inducement to the Turkish Government to accede to the British requests. On the other hand, the possibility of a competitive line southward of Bagdad, together with the knowledge that, should an arrangement be made with an English financial group, article 29 would be abrogated, and the completion of the whole railway and its full earning power thereby expedited, wxmld, we think, render the German concessionnaires willing to listen to proposals for British participation. It may perhaps be desirable that, before any negotiations on the subject are undertaken, consideration should be given to the financial clauses of the present con vention with a view to ascertaining whether, and if so to what extent, it may be\ 23 advisable to offer to the lurkish Governnieiit or to the German concessionnaires, or to both, a participation in the proceeds of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section. We have, &amp;c. R. P. MAXWELL. R. RITCHIE. GEO. J. STANLEY. W. TYRRELL. PERCY ASHLEY. R. C. LINDSAY. Appendix. Memorandum on Railway Proposals in regard to Mesopotamia. THE following memorandum is concerned solely with the commercial possibilities of the three alternative railway proposals which have been placed before the committee. These are :— (i.) An attempt to participate in the existing Bagdad Railway Concession, by an arrangement with the present concessionnaires to undertake the construction of the section from Bussorah by the right bank of the Euphrates to Bagdad (via Kerbela) and, if possible, northward still to Mosul; with these would go also, if obtainable, a line from Bagdad via Khanikin to Kermanshak. (ii.) The construction of a railway from Bussorah to Bagdad, either to the east of the Tigris or between the Tigris and the Euphrates, with a branch to Kerbela : this is to be in competition with the Bagdad Railway as already planned. (iii.) The construction of a railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo, thence to Meskene, and thence by the valley of the Euphrates, on the right bank, to Hit, and then across the river eastward to Bagdad, with the possibility of continuing the line to the Gulf. As regards the section Alexandretta-Aleppo, it is to be remembered that should the Turkish Government itself not build such a line a French company has the first right to a concession, and, should they not desire to exercise it, the right appears to revert to the German company. The length of the railway from Alexandretta to Aleppo would be about 92 miles ; from Aleppo to Hit about 380 miles ; and from Hit to Bagdad about 100 miles—or say 600 miles in all. The railway distance from Bagdad to Bussorah (as contemplated by the German concession) is 350 miles ; the distance would be about the same by a railway on the east of the Tigris ; by a route across the plains between the rivers the distance would be about 280 to 300 miles. In the almost total absence of any satisfactory statistical data, the considerations to be taken into account must necessarily be of a very general character ; and in the first place it may be convenient to take the first two schemes, which may be called the “ Gulf ” schemes, together, and compare them with the third, or “ Mediterranean ” scheme. In both cases what is desired is to increase British hold upon the trade of Mesopotamia, in view both of its present importance and of the probable expansion as the result of irrigation. At present the main route of trade into and from Mesopotamia is by the Persian Gulf and the Tigris River ; there is a large transit trade with Persia via Khanikin; some small amount of goods comes in from the north, via Erzeroum, Kbarput, and Diarbekir, and there is a considerable traffic between Syria and Mesopotamia, via Aleppo, Maskene, and the valley of the Euphrates, to Bagdad (bv caravans and boats), or via Beirout, Damascus, Karyatain, Mayadim, and the Euphrates valley (by caravans and boats also). No statistics are available of the amount and value of the trade which passes by these last three routes, but it appears to be quite small, relatively, to the traffic into and from Mesopotamia by the Gulf and Persian routes. The Gulf railway schemes are based upon existing and well-ascertained conditions, and the speculative elements are very slight. Either of the lines from Bussorah to Bagdad would pass through a tract of country which by reason of the alluvial deposit is already very fertile, producing wheat, barley, and other cereals, rice, dates, and24 • liquorice in great quantities, and with possibilities for silk and cotton; there is a con siderable amount of sheep and cattle-rearing ; there are large and important towns and a population growing with some rapidity ; one part of the region (that around Kerbela) is a very important pilgrim resort—80,000 to 100,000 pilgrims, mainly from Persia, are estimated to visit Kerbela annually; a steady stream of trade, both for Mesopotamia and Persia, already passes through the country, and it seems to be well established that the present traffic facilities are totally inadequate ; and finally, there is a fully-developed trade organisation ready to take full and immediate advantage of the economic expansion which is likely to follow upon the execution of the irrigation schemes, the improvement of agricultural methods, and administrative reforms. The value of the imports into Bagdad from Europe amounted in 1907 to 1,784,9817., and from India, China, and the Persian Gulf to 527,3997.; the value of the exports to Europe and America amounted to 557,0857., and to India and China to 153,2037. In addition to this there were large shipments of grain by native craft, of which no details are available. So far as construction is concerned, neither of the Gulf schemes presents any engineering difficulties, and accordingly, in view of the economic conditions and possibilities of the Bussorah-Bagdad region, there seems no reason to doubt that a railway there would speedily become remunerative, if it were not so from the first. Whether two competing railways would be likely to be financially successful, and if not, which of the two alternative schemes it would be desirable to adopt, are questions which will be considered later. Turning now to the proposed Mediterranean route, it must be pointed out that the proposal is far from being a new one, that no new facts have so far been advanced in its support, and that it rests largely upon anticipations as to future possibilities, instead of upon present conditions. (a.) Almost from the very commencement of railway enterprise the possibility of the construction of a railway from Alexandretta along the Euphrates valley was con templated, mainly as an overland route to India. Various surveys Avere made, and finally, as Major Ramsay has pointed out, the matter Avas considered very fully in 1871, after the opening of the Suez Canal, by a Committee of the House of Commons, which took voluminous evidence, and received also, through the Foreign Office, a number of reports from consular officers and others acquainted with the country. The Committee considered an alternative proposal for a line to folloAv a route closely resembling that of the present Bagdad Railway concession. Though they reported in favour of the Euphrates Valley line, it is not apparent that, as Major Ramsay appears to suppose, they had any great confidence in the commercial possibilities of the scheme; they favoured it because it Avould be considerably the shorter and cheaper to construct, and afford quicker passage for persons, troops, or mails, but they expressly stated that the Tigris route might attract the larger amount of traffic. General Chesney, Avho had long before surveyed the route, expressed the opinion that heavy goods would continue to go (to India) by the canal, “leaving the light valuable goods, mails, passengers, troops, and treasure to go by rail.” The decision of the Committee seems to have been determined largely by strategical considerations. In the early discussions of routes for the present Bagdad Railway concession the Germans made a preliminary survey of the Euphrates Valley route, but abandoned the idea of utilising it. (b.) The evidence given before the Committee of 1871 shoAved that from Meskene, where the proposed line Avould strike the Euphrates, to Hit, Avhich is the head of the fertile districts, the course of the river is through a valley of a few miles in Avidth, Avith a slight alluvial deposit, and fairly generally cultivated ; beyond that there is on both sides arid prairie, Ayhich is covered in the spring months with a prolific growth of rank grasses. In 1871 it was stated that the prairie undulates greatly, and' at every few miles forms gaps or Avide ravines, which are flooded in the rainy season. There are scarcely any toAvns of any degree of importance, and the country as a Avhole is very sparsely populated. There is a considerable amount of sheep-rearing under difficulties. Between Aleppo and the Euphrates there is a gently undulating plain, mostfy devoid of trees and Avith SAA r ampy valleys. Major Ramsay quotes, in Appendix No. 1 to his despatch, some opinions as to the prospects of the raihvay, only one of which (that of Sir Henry Rawlinson) is antagonistic. He does not, hoAvever, refer to the Consular opinions collected by the Foreign Office, and a reference to these shoAvs that there Avas a much stronger body of hostile opinion (represented by Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert, Consul-General at Bagdad, Mr. Consul Holmes, Mr. Vice-Consul Rassam at Mosul, Mr. W. G. Palgrave, Mr. Consul-GeneralJSi 25 Wood, and Mr. Consul Taylor) than would appear from the list of opinions cited by Major Ramsay. There was, in fact, a very marked divergence of opinion. It should be stated, however, that some of the advocates of the line, including members of Sir George Chesney’s mission, based their case upon the possibility of reclaiming land, developing agriculture, and creating a population, and also upon the establishment and maintenance of order. Major Ramsay's notes, in Appendix No. 2 to his despatch, do not add much to the information contained in the Report and evidence of the Committee of 1871, and apparently his observations relate almost solely to the country immediately on the banks of the river. The report by Sir William Willcocks is lacking in exact details, and it is not always clear to what part of the Euphrates valley he refers ; nor is there any evidence in his memorandum that he has himself visited the country between Meskene and Hit. (c.) The proposal,.so far as the line from Aleppo to Hit is concerned, is then based on assumptions as to the probable economic developments which would be likely to follow upon the organisation of irrigation works, the growth of population, promotion of systematic agriculture, and the development of transport facilities. All the factors for the speedy success of a railway which are present in the district Bussorah-Bagdad are absent from the region of the middle Euphrates, and it must inevitably take a very considerable time to call them into being. The line presents no engineering difficulties of any kind, and the estimate made in 1871, of 6,500?. per mile from Aleppo to the Euphrates, and of 8,000?. a mile along the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf, is scarcely likely to be exceeded at the present day. This would make the total cost of construction from Aleppo to Bagdad about 4,000,000?. A recent advocate of this line (Mr. George Lloyd) remarks that “ it is not suggested that it would be likely to do more than pay expenses, if as much, for several years after it was built.” The German Bagdad line, tapping the Diarbekir-Mosul region, has, from the point of view of immediate commercial success in regard to local traffic, a very great advantage. Much of the earning capacity of the line would depend on the extent to which goods which at present go to or from Europe via the Persian Gulf would be diverted to the new route. This again is a problem for the solution of which there are no adequate data. But it may be pointed out — (L.) That, so far as India’s trade is concerned, she has nothing to gain by the construction of a railway from the Mediterranean to Bagdad. The values of her imports into and exports from Bagdad have already been stated; with the economic development of Mesopotamia a considerable expansion of her trade there may confidently be anticipated ; there is the important Persian trade; and it must also be remembered that, with the increase of grain production in Mesopotamia, she may be able, in times of famine, to draw from that country greatly enlarged supplies. The construction of railways in the Bussorah-Bagdad region is therefore likely to be of immediate and practical interest to Indian trade ; but, on the other hand, it is not apparent that any direct benefit would result to her trade from the Euphrates route from Bagdad to the Mediterranean, since it is at best very doubtful if railway carriage for goods can ever compete successfully with water carriage to India ; (2.) That, whilst the existing trade routes on the whole markedly favour British and Indian trade with Mesopotamia, the construction of the new route would help foreign competitors quite as much, if not more, than British traders ; (3.) That any diversion of traffic might have a disadvantageous effect upon the finances of the Suez Canal; (4.) That so long as the Alexandretta-Aleppo section, the lines northward from Bagdad and from Bagdad into Persia, and the line from Bagdad to the Gulf were not in British hands, it would be possible for the companies working those lines to cripple, if not by differential rates then by methods of working, the utility of the Euphrates line to British traders. The conclusion to be derived from the considerations which have now r been set out appears to be that the construction of the Euphrates line from the Mediterranean to Bagdad would by itself be an enterprise from which little, if any, financial profit or any substantial benefit to British trade would be likely to be derived for a considerable period, whereas the Bussorah-Bagdad line maybe expected to be profitable from the outset and advantageous to the trade alike of the United Kingdom and India. [ 216 ] H26 The foregoing remarks have been directed to the consideration of the relative merits of the railways to Bagdad from Aleppo and Bussorah respectively, and to the support of the contention that if a choice has to be made between the two, the advantage of the Bussorah route is very pronounced. There is, however, the possibility of a through line from Aleppo via Bagdad to Bussorah, much shorter than the line to be built under the present German concession. But it may be pointed out that in such a line the commercial advantages of the Bagdad-Bussorah section might be counter balanced by the unprofitableness of the Bagdad-Aleppo section, and if the former section were competitive with the German line through the same region, its earning power would undoubtedly be much reduced. At an average cost of 8,000/. a-mile, the total cost of construction of such a line would be from about 7,500,000/. to about 8 , 000 , 000 /. Considerable as the trade of Southern Mesopotamia is at present, and large as are the possibilities of the future, it scarcely appears probable that there is room for two competing lines. The line to the east of the Tigris would be less competitive than that between the two rivers, but would have little, if any, advantage over the German route in point of length. The route secured for the German line to the west of the Euphrates has the very substantial advantage that it will draw to itself the large pilgrim traffic from Persia to Kerbela and the considerable trade which is growing up at that town ; by either of the proposed British routes the railway would touch no considerable town, and would be largely dependent on through traffic. Moreover, there would clearly be difficulties in relation to traffic northwards of Bagdad. It is only in the country there through which the German line is to pass that there is, or is likely to be for a number of years, any large market, and it is fairly certain that goods destined for any points beyond Bagdad would be sent wherever possible right through from Bussorah on one and the same—that is, the German—line. Similarly all goods coming for export from north of Bagdad would preferably go through to Bussorah without transference from one line to another at Bagdad. And it is not clear that the British lines such as are proposed would be able effectively to compete by reduction of rates with a line which passes through a better part of Southern Mesopotamia, and also forms part of a larger system, drawing on a larger and more profitable area. The cost of construction of a line from Bagdad to Bussorah has been estimated at .about 8,000/. a-mile, which would mean a total of about 3,000,000/. if the route followed were the proposed German route to the west of the Euphrates, or the proposed British route east of the Tigris. At the same rate a line over the plains between the rivers would cost about 2,250,000/. to 2,500,000/. to construct. 0 It may be observed that the difference in cost between the German concession line and the shorter competing line is probably not much more than 500,000/., and that the earning capacity of either of the two competing lines, and particularly of the English line, would be very much less than that of the German line by itself. On the whole, then, if it be decided, as appears advisable, to concentrate attention on the Bussorah-Bagdad region, it would be desirable that an attempt should be made to obtain participation in the German scheme; and if, failing that, efforts be made to obtain a concession for an alternative route, it should be on the distinct under standing that such a concession is sought because it is deemed necessary that British trade should possess an independent route into the heart of Mesopotamia, whether it be immediately remunerative or not. Commercial Department, Board of Trade, June 1909. * The estimate of an average cost of 8,000/. a-mile was made originally in 1871, and was adopted again by the Inter-Departmental Committee of 1907. Though wages and salaries have risen considerably since 1871, prices have fallen, freights have decreased, and engineering science has progressed; and consequently it appears reasonable to accept the figure which was carefully calculated in 1871.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001de_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B172</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001de</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B172</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum respecting the Bagdad Railway, 1909'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1910/1910</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-19T00:07:44</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>bound in volume with other documents (17 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this description commences at f.139, and terminates at f.155, since it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
