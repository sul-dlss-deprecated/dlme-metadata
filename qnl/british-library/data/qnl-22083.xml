No. C/151 lated the 6 th March 1939. I gather there was a good deal of objection this year on the part of the Shias to the large congregation of foreigners, mostly Americans and Europeans, who came down to photograph the somewhat unpleasant ecstasies of the Muharram processions 5 and that as a result the ^hias decided at the last minute to change their route and to avoid the main square. T hear also that several Europeans and Americans pursued the processions into the side streets and that one or two minor scuffles ensued, though in point of fact no official complaints have been made either to myself or to the Oil Company by the people involved. 2. Though the cessation of these gory spectacles would be admirable from every point of view, it is obvious that this is not the way to put an end to them; and it seems to me fortunate that none of the European or American camera fiends got badly hurt this year. I think it would be rather tooA C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.- 2 - © i v too optimistic to expect similar lucky results in future and, if you agree with me, X propose to write to the Oil Company saying that the numbers of Europeans and Americans watching and photographing the processions must be very strictly limited (I have the number 25 in mind): and that they must go direct to the central square by a fixed route, stay there until the processions are over — whether or not they enter the square and return by the same fixed route* It would be unreasonable, I think, to prevent people going about their business on the tenth day of Muhurram in the main streets, but I should like also to restrict them to certain specified streets and roads# 3# Ail this may saem a little harsh, but it is of the utmost importance to obviate the possibility of serious incidents involving the local and Persian Shias on the one hand and Europeans or Americans on the other# 4 .

Bahrain, March 16, 1939. / \ Dear Weightman, I agree with the views expressed in your C/151 a dated 6th March 1939 on the subject of the Muharram procession. 2. The objection was almost entirely to the taking of photographs although the Shias also spoke of people laughing at the procession which is, of course, from their point of view, unsuitable. 3. As for the possibility of the procession ceasing, I think it is more likely to increase as it has become larger every year for the last five or six years. This year, for the first time, there were processions outside Manamah^on the llth^and the village Bahama began to do the sword business. 4. from what I have heard since the event, I understand that nobody would object to Europeans and Americans looking on - in any number - provided that no cameras were used and that the spectators behaved suitably. 5. It is dangerous for Europeans and Americans to mix with the procession in the narrow lanes, people are liable to get struck by swords accidentally and if they appear to be laughing at the procession they are likely to be hit deliberately. I entirely agree that this might lead to serious incidents. H. leightman, Esquire, I.C.S., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Yours sincerely, . OiliClJLJL J JulOv^U.J.a.w^ Political Agent,Confidential br B.O. No. C/180-12/18 Dated the 21st March 1939. t Seme days ago I mentioned to the Managers of the Com pany the matter of the !/uharram processions. As you know the Shias this year abandoned their normal processional route into the main square on account of their objection to the large battery of cameras brought by British, American and Indian sight-seers. Some of these sight-seers pursued the processions into side streets where, to be frank, they * ere in considerable danger of receiving serious injuries. In point of fact no one was hurt this year though there were one or two minor scuffles. 2. It is clear enough that we cannot take chances like this again in future. The consequences of a possible riot in which Europeans or Americans were injured would be extremely serious, and I do not consider that the somewhat unpleasant ecstasies of the Uuharram processions are of sufficient interest or value to foreign spectators to justify such a risk being taken. I had originally intended to propose that the numbers of European, American and Indian spectators from Manama, Awali and Arabia alike/- The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain Black, Esouirei alike should be very strictly limited^ but I understand now that the Shias object not so much to the numbers of spectators as to their cameras and to the unsuitable behaviour of many of them in laughing at the (admittedly absurd) contortions in which the Shias indulge. On one or two points I am quite definite; i.e. spectators can only be allowed to assemble in the central square, which they must approach or leave by certain specified routes; no one must carry a camera: and no one must follow the processions into the side streets; if cameras are brought they will be taken by the Police, and similarly any one following the processions into the side streets will be liable to instant arrest. Subject to these desiderata I am prepared to fall in with any suggestions that the Company may themselves wish to make in regard to the numbers of passes which they would issue for spectators. I hope it will be possible to restrict the numbers coming across from Saudi /rabia since after all there is no particular reason why they should come here for the processions, but otherwise I do not feel very strongly on this point -- except that I trust that the Managers will make their proposals with due reference to the fact that the more spectators come down from the Camp the more difficult it is to ensure that none of them have cameras. Incidentally I should perhaps say here that I will take identical/- j i sI (D - 3 - j Identical steps so far as residents in Manama are concerned for the prevention of photographing and of unseemly behaviour# 3# There is one other point to be considered# Naturally one does not wish to impose any interference on people going about their legitimate business on the tenth day of Muharram f but it is clearly desirable that Europeans} Americans and Indians should be required to use certain roads only in Manama on that day in fact only the main streets, 4# Would you be good enough to let me have the views of your Company on this matter as soon as possible ?

As P.A is aware Muharram in Bahrain is an occasion for a somewhat disgusting exhibition by the processionists from the various mahtams who cut them selves about the heads with swords and knives and generally work themselves up into a state of frenzy and excitement. So far as I am aware Muharram pro fessions are not allowed to take place in this way in any other jbart of the Moslem World and even in Iraq in the towns of Nejaf and Kerbala where the main Shia* shrines are situated I am told that pro cessions are controlled and that generally speaking those who take part in the Muharram proceedings are not allowed to leave their mahtams. It seems to me that it is time that some effort was made to exercise similar control in Bahrain. Bach year Muharaam pro cessionists become more excited and there are always unpleasant incidents. Excitement reaches fever pitch and it only requires some small incident to cause very unpleasant developments with which in my view the Police would be totally unable to deal. During last Muharram I was present to watch the Police arrangements in the central square in Manama where most of the blood .flows. These arrangements consist principally of a large number of men on duty with each procession and a body of armed police on the roof of a building in the square. These armed police could in no circumstances open fire in such a situation as to do so with .303 rifles would mean killing many innocent spectators. 2. I made some enquiries and I learn that this exhibitionism has the disapproval of many of the leading Shias /-Confidential D.O.

C/932 dated 1st December 1940 Thank you for sending me Hallows's note on Muharram processions. “'1' The Shias taking part in it and most of the spectators look upon it as a religious demonstra tion, many of them are intensely affected by the sight. I quite agree that to our eyes it is an unpleasant and senseless exhibition* I suppose I have seen it about 14 times and I always go down at night as well, and I have never seen any serious incident take place. The procession is controlled by the police and the route is decided by them* $hat actually happens is that each of the Matems is visited in turn by the bands of men who belong to the Matems. Most Sunnis and some of the leading Shias pro fess to disapprove of the procession but His Highness has always shown his religious toleration by allow ing the procession and by lending his own horses and camels to the performers* Many of his relations attend as spectators. I personally would be loath openly to advocate restricting the procession because it is regarded by the Bahrain Shias, among them men of reasonable intelligence and education, as a sort of religious duty which earns them credit in the future. lor a Ll.- 2 - a non-Moslem or even a Sunni to try to confine this demonstration to inside the Matems might well be deliberately misinterpreted by mischief makers as interference in religious observances. The people who might be able to effect some change are the Shia ^adis but I doubt whether they would be willing to incur the odium of the public. Some of the Bahrain Matems do not join the pro cession in the day time though they process at night. The majority of the performers on the 10th Muharram are Persians and they are organised by the leading Persian merchants of Manamah, almost all of them foreign subjects. I do not know whether you would consider speaking to them about the matter. If the Persians were not in the procession I am sure our own people would be discouraged. Yours sincerely Major R. G. E. W. nlban, O.3.E., H.B.M ! s Political Agent, Bahrain. 5Confidential. D.O. No. k'H./SF. Bahrain, Feby. 1, 1943. f c I enclose a note on the recent disturbance during the Muharram procession. We are dealing with the case in the Bahrain Court, and I expect for to be hearing it/several days. E. B. Wakefield, Esquire, I.C.S., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.During the first ten days of the month of Muharram the Shias in Bahrain who constitute over half of the population hold readings in their Matems every evening. In Manamah there are about a dozen large matems^capable of holding several hundred men and smaller matems exist in every village, A matem is a building which resembles a church hall in an English village. It is partly a religious build ing and is maintained by religious endowments but it is used on secular occasions and eating and smoking is permitted inside it. Separate matems exist for women and for children. The matems are managed by one or more of the leading men of the neighbourhood frequently by members of the man who originally built and endowed the matem. Each matem has its own patrons who fre quent it in the same way as members frequent a club. There has always been, in Manamah, a certain amount of rivalry between the matems. During the first seven days of Muharram all the Shias congregate in the matems at night listening to the preachers who usually succeed in stirring their audiences into a state of great excitement and emotion. On the eighth and ninth nights of Muharram the men from each matem after the reading go out into the town in procession, each matem having its own procession. They carry banners, torches, effigies and many hundreds of them beat their chests, others flog themselves with chains and on the last night they brandish the swords which they use on the tenth in the day time procession when they cut their heads open. The largest matem is the Persian matem which- 2 - er which produces the most elaborate procession. Each procession carries out a kind of 'follow my leader' visiting all the other matems in turn. The men enter the matem and circle round several times and then pour out into the street. This practice seems to have existed for about 25 years, before then processions were not allowed by the Khalifah Shaikhs either at night or by day. His Highness Shaikh Hamad, although a Sunni, is very broadminded and averse to interfering in any way with the religious liberty of his people. Every year he lends some of his horses and camels to take part in the procession. The band of the State Police has taken part in the procession for several years. Although many of the incidents and the figures repre sented in the procession must be objectionable to the Sunnis no complaint has been made on their grounds an^Umany of the leading Arabs look on at the proces sions which they regard merely as a spectacle. During the ten days as many police as are avail able are on duty in the Bahama (Shia) quarter of Manamah where the matems are situated. On the last two nights when processions take place and on the 10th during the final day time procession the police acco.m- pany and direct the processions and organise them through the heads of the matems, so that no procession comes in contact with the other. This part of the town consists for the most part of narrow streets and lanes which are not lit, some of the matems are close together. In the last 20 years no serious incidents have taken place during the night processions.On the eighth night of Muharram, this month, the usual processions started out from the matems accompanied by the police most of whom were armed with lathis * A reserve party of police with rifles were stationed in a lorry on the edge of the matem neighbourhood. It appears, though there is as yet no definite proof of this, that the headmen of 'matem bin Rejab' were on bad terms with one of the leaders of the Persian matem. The police had no knowledge of this at the time# At the time when the disturbance took place the Bin Rejab procession was accompanied by Sub- Inspector ^Abdulkarim, himself a Shia. Fearing that the Bin Rejab procession would enter one of the lanes where the Persian procession was still passing Sub Inspector Abdulkarim diverted the head of the procession in another direction. This annoyed the Bahama and they tried to force their way down a narrow alley to the lane where the Persians were marching# A number of them succeeded in doing this, Abdulkarim and one or two policemen were caught be tween the two processions, who began fighting with each other and were roughly handled. Sub Inspector Abdulkarim fired a shot in the air in order to summon more men# More police arrived and eventually sepa rated the Persians and the Bahama each party retiring to its own matem with the police following them# Persians in the neighbourhood of the Persian matem flung stones, chairs and cooking pots onto the crowd below indiscri minately injuring some of the police and some of the men in the processions. A Persian, by name Kawesh, appears to have incited the Persians by shouting to4- to them that Mahmood bin Abdulnabi had been killed by the Bin Rejab people* During the fighting the torches and lamps were hurled to the ground, oil spilt and caught fire and this added to the general confusion. The whole incident however only lasted a few minutes and when I arrived, at midnight, every thing was quiet but the two matems were full of men who had shut themselves in. They were told to go back to their homes quietly which they did. About 20 arrests were made and the case is now being dealt with by the Bahrain Court. Three men are in hospital with broken heads and a number of people are said to have received superficial injuries. Several of the police were injured but none seriously. There are no grounds whatever for supposing that the quarrel was a political onej* between Persians and Bahama. These communities, in Manamah, are on good terms. The headman of the Bin Re jab matem is the father-in-law of Mahmood bin Abdulnabi, one of the leaders of the Persian matem and many of the members of the two matems are related to each other. On the following morning I reported the matter to His Highness Shaikh Hamad and asked his permission to forbid any processions on the last night of the ten days n Leilat Ashur'. His Highness, with consi derable reluctance, agreed to my suggestion. The heads of matems whose members usually take part in the processions were informed that no night processions would be permitted. At the same time they were told that the day time procession on the morning of the 10 th would be allowed provided that the heads of each matem gave personal guarantees that they would obey-5- obey all directions given to them by the police, that they would be responsible if any trouble took place and that no weapons would be carried. Three of the Bahama matems agreed to these conditions and appeared on the 10th as usual. The heads of the Persian matem and the Bin Rejab matems refused the conditions and took no part in the procession. Proceedings against 19 persons, Bahrain subjects, are now proceeding in the Bahrain Court but the case is difficult to deal with as owing to the darkness and the general confusion it was difficult at the time for the police to recognise the men who were most aggressive. Several people seem to have taken the opportunity to get their own back on others with whom they were on bad terms and the evidence is diffi cult to disentangle. Shaikhs Mohomed Abdullah and Sulman have discussed the matter with me and they would like to persuade His Highness to obtain a 'fatwah' from the Shia Ulema in Iraq as to the undesirability of Muharram proces sions. Armed with this they would forbid all such processions in future. The leading Bahama however are seriously disturbed at the prospect of the Sunni government interfering in what they regard as a reli gious rite. It is being suggested that the whole affair was staged in order to give the government an opportunity of curtailing the activities of t'he Shias, this is of course entirely untrue. I consider personally that processions at night through the narrow lanes and alleys in the middle of the town are liable to lead to trouble but that th&lt; S day time procession under supervision is not; liabl e i- 0 — —— m- - - —to cause a disturbance* In the day time people who misbehave can be «e recognised but at night this is difficult and the cover of darkness pro vides a good opportunity for people who wish to cause mischief*\ Confidential D»0* No. C/147 Dated the 3rd February 1942. / / Many thanks for the note on the recent Muharram disturbance which you sent with your demi-official letter No. 82/SF dated the 1st February 1942.
