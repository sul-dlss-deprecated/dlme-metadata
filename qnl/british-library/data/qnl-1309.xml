To Thb Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., Bis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Dated Coronation Durbar, the 7th December 1911. My Lord Marquis, With reference to Your Lordship’s Despatch No. 22 (Secret), dated the 11th August 1911, on the subject of buoys and beacons in the Persian Gulf, we have the honour to inform you that we agree to the settlement of the claim of the British India Steam Navigation Company for the cost of the lighted buoy, laid in the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. As desired by Your Lordship in paragraph 2 of the Despatch, we enclose for your information a copy of the valuation statement of buoys* eliminating those which were never taken over from the Company and showing the amount by which the sum of £1,000 paid to the Company is to be reduced. 3 3. In connection with the question of the adjustment of the expenditure on account of the buoys and the beacon in the Persian Gulf, the cost of which is to be borne in equal shares between the Home and Indian Governments, the Indian moiety being debited to the Royal Indian Marine estimates, a doubt has arisen in regard to the adjustment of the recurring expenditure on account of the maintenance of the buoys. As reported in our telegram dated the 5th February 1910, this expenditure was estimated by the Director, Royal Indian Marine, at Rs. 2,030 per annum. To this figure must be added Rs. 600 (£10), the estimated recurring cost of maintenance of the acetylene gas buoy obtained from the British India Steam Navigation Company, thus raising the total annual cost to Rs. 2,630. We shall be glad to be informed whether it is intend ed that debits should be raised by the Indian Government against the Home Government in respect of a moiety of the recurrent expenditure actuallyincurred from time to time in India, or whether the moiety payable by the Home Government will be a fixed amount based on the above estimate and adjusted by the India Office. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, Y (\AsX n1911 . COBONATION DURBAR. FOREIGN EEFA.RTMENT. SECRET. External.

Secret, No. 22. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, I transmit for the information of Your Excellency’s Government, T . , . 7 7 , 7 copy of a letter from the British Liqktmq and buoyaqe of the T c, at • ✓-&lt; Persian Gulf Indian bteam Navigation Company, enclosing a claim for 616L 8,s. 10d., for the cost of the lighted buoy, with a supply of carbide, that was laid in the Shatt-el-Arab in accordance with the suggestion originally put forward in Your Excellency’s telegram of the 16th July 1910. With a deduction in respect of the carbide, which properly falls under the head of maintenance, the amount is within the figure of 600L stated in the letter addressed to the Company on the 26th August 1910, of which copy is enclosed, and I propose to settle the account on learning from Your Excellency’s Government (as I hope to do at an early date) that you have no observations to offer thereon. The amount will be divided between British and Indian revenues. 2. A further matter for final settlement with the Company is the charge for the buoys and beacon in the Persian Gulf transferred by them to Government. It was originally agreed that the sum of 1,000Z. should be paid for the buoys (15) and beacon (1) named in the enclosed list, the value of which to the Company was Rs. 32,380. 3. 10, as stated in the last column but one. Certain of the buoys, however, were afterwards found to be missing, and the sum of 1,000L is to be reduced in the proportion borne by their value to the total sum of Rs. 32,380. I request that I may receive precise information as to the buoys that were never, in fact, transferred, and the amount by which the sum of 1,000L should accordingly be reduced. The necessary adjustment will then be made with the Company, to whom the sum of 1,000L was paid, in advance, in February last. The information would be most conveni ently supplied by noting on one of the copies of the statement now forwarded.

The Carbide for lighting the buoy will be despatched to Busreh from Marseilles within the next few days. As it may be the desire of the Government of India to place this buoy themselves instead of having it placed by the Company, seeing that the other buoys in the Persian Gulf and in the Shat-a1-Arab are being taken over by the Government of India, I am directed to enquire what your wishes are on the point. In event of the Government of India deciding to place the gas buoy themselves, the Agents of the Company in Bombay will be directed to hand the Bill of Lading over to the Director of Indian Marine, and to leave him to take delivery of the buoy.

I agree, provided cost of 1,000Z. is proportionally reduced. In any case, if the British Indian Company replace missing buoys, cost of 1,000Z. should be reduced as Lawrence buoy will not be replaced.

British India Company report one at Bahrein recently replaced, and Com mander “Negra” instructed to report regarding others, which may be submerged. Please explain reasons for replacement by Government if any should be finally missing, with estimates. From Viceroy, tith December 1910. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 28th November. Persian Gulf buoys. Director, Royal Indian Marine, reports that present buoys are of various sizes, similarly anchors and chains, the former being also too heavy to be weighed or laid by Royal Indian Marine Steamer “ Lawrence’s ” cutter in shallow water, the water being too shallow for the “Lawrence” to weigh and lay them herself. (It has been proposed that the “Lawrence” should undertake care and maintenance of buoys and beacon. Please see letter to Director, Rfljjal Indian Marine, forwarded with Secretary’s letter No. 34 M, dated 1st September.) To obviate difficulty Director proposes replacing missing buoys now and other buoys as occasion arises by buoys of uniform shape and size which could be made sufficiently distinctive by being painted differently. He con siders that future replacements of any missing buoys could thus also be done far more economically as it will only be necessary to maintain reserve of two spare buoys of uniform size instead of spare buy of each of the different shapes and sizes of present buoys. He estimates buoy of proposed pattern complete with moorings to cost Rs. G40. Present buoys and their com ponents as replaced would be utilised as far as possible in dockyard or sold if necessary and the proceeds credited. The reason for proposing that “ Lawrence’s ” buoy should not be replaced, vide my telegram of 9th ultimo, is that channel has shifted./ I am instructed by the Directors of the British India Steam Navigation Company to inform you that they have ordered and despatched to Busreh via Bombay, to be fixed in position on the Outer Bar of the Shatt-al-Arab, an Automatic Acetylene Gas Buoy, with a Lantern of 305 candle power, which will give a light of nine miles radius. Arrangements are also being made to ship from here, as soon as we can find a steamer which will carry Calcium Carbide, two tons of that material for generating acetylene gas for lighting the Buoy, and it is expected that shipment of this Carbide can be effected by a steamer sailing from here in December or January next for Busreh. I am also instructed to advise you, for the information of the Secretary of State, that the estimated cost of the Buoy, Lantern and Lighting Material delivered at Busreh is as follows Buoy £468-15-0 Lantern 124-15-0 Two tons Carbide ... 35- 0-0 ) Total £628-10-0 /vi'\ /??'■' 'tL. *|/ .3') 'A-i jA A 'f*. . , ) U ==== = ====: to which will be added the cost of moorings, the cost of fitting the whole plant in position, and any Customs Duty which may be charged by the Turkish Customs, and which, under present regulations, may amount to 11 $ of the invoice value. 6^i ;i ( 2 ) ¥e shall arrange, if possible, to have the moorings fixed and ready before the Buoy is sent up, so that the Buoy may be dropped at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab, and importation into Busreh and consequent duty avoided.

Meetings of the imtive end foreign mer chants of Basrah have been summoned to which the Commo dore has submitted a very comprehensive scheme of im provements. At the second of these meetings the Ger man Representatives strongly supported the Turkish pro posals, observing that they would prefer to pay for the laying down of buoys themselves rather than be under ob ligation to the British India Steam Navigation Company. The Commodore stated that he would put lights at Pao and the outer buoy without levying dues at present, while the Acting Vali, who was also present, said that the matter was one which concerned the Turkish Government. he Secretary to the Treasury, There■r*'' ^w-S There is thus every prospect that, if no measures are taken hy His Majesty’s Government in regard to the matter, a start will he made hy the local authorities with operations which, if permitted to proceed and if subsequently promoted and extended by the Ottoman Gov ernment, might very conceivably clash with the Persian Gulf system of lighting and buoying and so seriously affect British interests in that region. Moreover in view of its proximity, Moharamerah, where it is particu larly desirable that British influence should be main tained and strengthened, will necessarily be affected by the improvements contemplated in the neighbourhood v of Basrah, and it is most undesirable, for the reasons set forth in the letters from this Office of January 5th 1909, May 12th, 1910, and June 3rd. 1910, that the lighting and buoying of these regions should be in other than British hands. It is held by His Majesty's Consul General at Bushire that the unexpected activity of the Turkish Commodore could probably be countered by the immediate placing of a light-ship or lighted buoy at the outer bar of the river. This measure is the one which appearsto be the meet urgent of those proposed by the Commodore and It is hoped that, if carried out promptly, it will have the effect of putting an end to the larger scheme of harbour improvements, which, from whatever source it was originally inspired, certainly does not appear to recezve any support from the commercial community at Basrah as a whole in the present conditions that port 0 of trade at The Report of the Committee on the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf, to which reference was made in the letter from this Office of May 12th last, re garded the lighting of the Shat-el-Arab as 'the most im portant item in the whole lighting scheme for the Gulf', and they recommended the stationing of a light vessel an eleven mile range and the lighting of the bar channel buoys. The cost of the fomer was estimated by the Representative of Trinity House on the Committee £9,500 initial and £650 recurring, and of the latter £600 initial and £40 recurring for each buoy. The light vessel contemplated need not be so ex pensive, but Sir E. Grey is not prepared to ask Iheir Lordships to sanction so considerable an expenditure as thatthat involved in the first proposal. He trusts, how ever, that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will be prepared to sanction the lighting of at least one buoy, half the cost of which will be provided from In dian revenues, leaving £300 initial and £20 recurring expenditure to be provided out of Imperial funds. I am to add that it is understood that the British India Steam Navigation Company would be willing to put down a lighted buoy at the outer bar without delay. His Majesty's Government subsequently taking it over at cost price with the others which have been the subject of previous correspondence. in view of the urgency of the matter. Sir E. Grey would be glad if he might be favoured with a reply at an early date. I am &amp;c.. (Signed)n n TREASURY CHAMBERS, 6th. August, 1910. Sir:- In the clrcumetances represented by Secretary Sir E.

I told him I understood from masters of British vessels navigating these waters, that it would he more useful to place the vessel at the outer buoy, in order to enable ships to pick up more easily than they can at present. I do not think the Commodore is likely to give effect to my suggestion but, if, as Colonel Cox points out, such a measure would not meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, I should be glad to be informed. I conveyed a summary of Captain Shakespear’s statementI o &lt; # statement regarding the Koweit light to the Commodore but, so far, the 'Kilid Bahar' has merely been towed to Abul Khassib and anchored off the Customs House there for the protection of sailing vessels from river attack.

His Majesty's Consul, Baarah to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs London. Telegraphic. June 24, 1910. In reply to Foreign Office telegram dated June 23. On the 21st of June a meeting of the principal natire and foreign merchants interested in shipping was called by the Commodore, hikmet Pasha, at his house in order to hear certain proposals put forward by the Commodore for the improvement of navigation and to discuss them. The Commodore's proposals were to dredge the bar and buoy the channel of the bar; to place a lightship s t the outer buoy and place on board it * suitable supply of experienced pilots to navigate ships to Basrah to place a lightship or a light house at F a o; to buoy the river road- stead for the better mooring of ships. The Commodore gere the meeting to understand that he thought the merchants interested in shipping at this port should contribute funds for carrying out these improyements and said they ought to do something to improre the port. The British merchants present at the meeting, which was1 1 1 &gt; fully representstlTe of the local shipping interest, offered no remarks on these suggestions heyond obserTing that the matter required consideration. The general opinion among British merchants is that present trade requirements are amply provided for by exist- ing facilities and that their oommeroe will not bear the cost of these expensive imprOTements. The merchants were asked to attend again on June 28th. I hare given instructions to British merchants confidentially to discourage the Commodore’s suggestions as much as possible and to do nothing to assist him in carrying out his proposals. It seems that Hazim Pasha the new Vali at Baghdad, and the Commodore have been laying their heads together and that this meeting is the outcome of their recent deliberations at Baghdad* I was not asked to attend meeting.

(19555) Sir:- The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury have had before Them Mr. Mallet's letter of the 12th instant, respecting the lighting and buoying of the Per sian Gulf, in which Secretary Sir E. Grey requests Their sanction to the purchase of the beacon and the fifteen buoys owned by the British India Company, for the sum of £1,000, and the charge of one half this amount as well as one half of the annual cost of upkeep (estimat ed at £135.6.8) against the Vote for Diplomatic and Consular Services. Their Lordships gather that the beacon and buoys in question are at present maintained at the sole cost of the British India Company, and They direct me to say that in these circumstances it is not clear to Them why His Majesty's Government should be required to pay the large sum of £1,000 down for the privilege of relieving the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.the Company of all future expense in the matter. Nor is it clear to Their Lordships, on the informa tion before Them, that the double purpose of keeping . the service entirely in British hands and of proving His Majesty's Government's interest in the matter could not be secured by some course short of the acquisition and maintenance of the buoys by Government, e.g. by offering, if necessary, to the British India Company a suitable contribution towards the cost of maintenance on condition of their undertaking not to accept any con tributions or assistance towards such maintenance from any but British firms or persons. W Lords desire not to commit Themselves at present even to this alternative, but before coming to a decision on the question of contribution as a matter of general policy. They would be glad to have further explanations of the proposal with reference to the fore going observations. I am, &amp;c.. (Signed) T. L. Heath.Draft. Treasury. Secret. Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir E.Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 9460/10 of the 31st ultimo respecting the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. I am to state that one of the princi pal objects which it is desired to attain by means of the modest scheme which has been put before the Lords Commissioners is that His Majesty/*s Government should, in face of the German overtures which are known to have been made, be able to point to some definite sign that they are iden tifying themselves with the security and convenience of navigation in the waters of the Gulf, and I am to point out that the alternative scheme suggested by Their Lordships would involve the disbursement of money for the benefit of the British (19,112.Wt.26,830—21. 1500. 12/09.

Slr:- I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to advert to your letter of January 27th, 1909 ^nc to previous correspondence relative to the visit of the Lighting and Buoyage Committee to the Persian Gulf. I am to state that a report has been drawn up em bodying the results of the investigations conducted by the Committee in the Persian Gulf and that it has been carefully considered by Sir E. Grey in consultation with the Secretary of State for India in Council, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Board of Traae. In this Report two alternative schemes were put forward for improving the lighting and buoying of the Gulf waters. The lees comprehensive of these schemes involves an initial outlay ol One hundred and twenty thousand five hundred and fifty pounds and an annual recurring The Secretary to the Treasury.£8,515. recurring axpeiuilture of Eight thousuio five hunorec and fifteen pounds. Viecount Morley is not prepared to undertake, on behalf of the Government of India, to defray a moiety of these sum. at the precont time, nor is Sir E. Grey at present disposed to uek the Lords CoraalseionerB of .His Majesty's Treasury to sanction so heavy an expenditure from the Diplomatic ana Consular Vote. Sir E. Grey is, however, of opinion that, in view of the considerations put forward in the letter from this Department of January 5th, 1909, especially having regard to the aesire of the Iiumburg*America Line to contribute to the upkeep of the buoys ownea the British India Company, that the time has come when His Majesty's Government should assume complete control over these buoys and the beacon, at present the pro perty of the latter Company, in order to preclude any possibility of participation by a subsidized German firm in the buoyage of these waters. It Is also, in Sir E. Grey's opinion. Important that His ajesty's Government should from time to time X taice135. 6. S take Borne measures, on however small a scale, which will have the effect of making it clear that they have not ceasaa to interest themselves in a special degree in the question of maintaining security for navigation in the Persian Oulf, that they are in no way remiss in fulfilling the duties imposed upon them by the special position which they occupy there, and that consequently there is no possible call for the intervention of on„ other Power in the matter. It has been ascertained that the British India Company would be willing to mke over to His Majesty’s Government the fifteen buoys and one beacon which ore at present owned unu maintained by the Company for the sum of One thousand pounds, ano that the upkeep of these is estimated to cost One hundred and thirty-five pounds six shillings and eightpence par annum. Pir E. Grey is of opinion that the taking over of theta buoys and the beacon by His Majesty’s Government, while effectually preventing the creation of vested interests by Germany and the encroachment of the Ham burg- America Line on a a here which has hitherto been exclusively\ \ exclusively British, would, at the saute time, fulfil, to a certain extent, the second general desideratum set fort! above. In these circumstances Sir E. Grey earnestly hopes that the Lords Commissioners will assent to the inclusion in the Diplomatic and Consular Vote of a moiety of the £500. two charges specified, vis: the suras of Five hundred £67. 13. 4. pounds Initial ana Sixty-seven pounds thirteen shillings and fourpenee recurring expenditure. I am to add that Viecount Morley concurs with Sir E. Grey's views on this question ana that His Lordship is prepared to aefray from Inuiun Government funes the other moiety of these charges. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,FOREIGN OFFICE, January 5th 1909. Secret and Immediate. (44856) tv Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state that he has recently had under consideration the question of British Shipping interests in the Persian Gulf and the increasingly severe competition which is being brought to bear on them. It has come to Sir E. Grey's notice that the German Hamburg-Merika Line are anxious to participate with the British India Steam Navigation Company in the up-keep of the buoys hitherto maintained by the latter Company in the Gulf. Sir E. Grey attaches great importance to the retention in British hands of the entire system of buoys in those waters,, and has been in communication with the Secretary of State for India and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the subject. The lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf are also considered to be of great importance by the Govern ment of India, and have formed the subject of careful con sideration by an interdepartmental conference recently held at The Secretary to the Treasury.at the Admiralty. It is thoughtdesirable that the general question of the better lighting of the Gulf should be examined locally by an officer experienced in light-house construction, in conjunction with the Political Resident in the Persian .rulf, the Senior Naval Officer on duty in the Gulf, and the officer in charge of the Marine Survey of India, but it is to be clearly understood that His Majesty’s Government are not pledged by sanctioning a Committee of Inquiry to any defin- II i i • ite action on the report of these Cfi'icers. It has been ascertained that the Trinity House would be willing to lend the services of a competent member of their Engineering Staff at a fee, exclusive oi iravellinu, and personal allowances, of 500 guineas, on the assumption that his services would be required for a period of not less than five months, the fee to be increased proportionately if the period were extended. In view of the importance attached to this question by Sir E. Grey as well as the Government of India, Lord Morley is pre pared to issue orders to the Government of India to bear half the cost of the expedition provided the British Exchequer will bear the other half, and I am to request therefore that you will submit ■H the matter to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and express thethe hope of Sir E. Grey that they will authorise an arrangement on this basis, in view of the important Imperial interests in volved. The British share in the expenditure could be met in the adjustment of accounts between the two Governments. As far as can be foreseen no extraordinary expenditure is likely to be in- v. cur red beyond that entailed by the employment of the Trinity House I expert. 1 Sir E. Grey would be glad if the Lords Gomniissioners could take the matter into consideration at an early date so that, in the event ol their concurrence, the work of the enquiry may not be unduly prolonged into the hot weather. It is thought that the question of ouoying could convenient ly be dealt with by the Officers commissioned to enquire into the matter of lighting the Gulf. I am &amp;c., (Signed) W.

Sir:- Foreign Office October 4 U?, 1909. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state that he has had under consideration your letter of the f 1st instant stating that Viscount Morley is not at present prepared to consider the question of giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee of En- quiry on the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf on the ground of the heavy expense which would thereby be involved. Sir E. Grey concurs in Lord Moriay 1 s view as re gards the impossibility at the present moment of car rying into effect the full scheme recommended by the Committee. He feels, however, that a beginning should be made as soon as possible with a project which should ultimately have the effect of strength- ening the position of this country in the Gulf and of precluding any suggestion from foreign Powers that His Majesty's The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(35709/09) Majesty's Government were not fulfilling adequately the special functions upon the exercise of which that position largely rests. Such a beginning could be made by the acceptance of the offer which was made by Sir J. Mackay, on be half of the British India Steam Navigation Corapany, in February 1907 and which, as will be seen from the enclosed copy of correspondence between this Office and Sir J. Mackay, has now been renewed. The cost in volved in taking over the buoys at present belonging to the Company and of their subsequent maintenance could not. Sir E. Grey imagines, be very great. It will be remembered that the Report of the Interdepart mental Committee which was held in July 1908 recom mended that all the existing buoys and the one exist ing beacon should be taken over from the British In dia Company, that the Indian Government should ar range for their maintenance and that the cost should be divided equally between the British and Indian re- venues. If Viscount Morley should concur in the above proposal. Sir E. Grey would be glad if he might be(35709/09) be informed at an early date what is likely to he the cost of the proposed service in order that the requi site application may he made to the Treasury at an early date. As will he seen from the Report of the Inter departmental Committee, eight of the sixteen buoys at present maintained by the British India Company are situated in the Shat-el-Arab. Practically all the shipping in the Gulf goes up to Basrah and Sir E. Grey understands that there is a real need in the in terests of British Shipping of an improvement of the present arrangements in the Shat-el-Arab. I am.

Dear Sir James Mackay:- I wrote to you on June 4th of last year ask ing you whether the British India Steam Navigation Company would still be willing to make over to His NaJ&amp;sty's Government the buoys belonging to the Com pany in the Gulf, on the terms mentioned in your letter to Mr. Maxwell of February 15th, 1907; that is to say for a nominal consideration, the Company continuing to maintain them free of cost to the Government. You are probably aware that a Committee of Enquiry have recently been deputed to go out to the Persian Gulf and to report on the requirements of the Gulfaulf waters In the matter of lights and buoys. We have now received the report of this Committee which, I see, contains some further correspondence on tills subject, including a letter from your Agents in Bombay to Mr. Armour, dated 31st July, 1908. In this communication they assess the value of the Company's buoys at their original cost, while making no mention of their maintenance free of charge to the Government in the event of their being transferred to them. We should be glad to know whether we are to under- s .and from this that the Company are not now prepared to carry out the offer which you were good enough to make in your letter to Mr. Maxwell, or whether they are in fact still prepared to maintain it?Iif any further communica tion on this subject, please quote M.0746. and address letter to— The Secretary, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W. Sir ~ C ONFIDENTS, - A dmiralty, 7th August 190 9. f I have laid before my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your letter dated 29th June, forwarding a copy of the Report of the Committee of Enquiry on the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf, and I am to request that you will lay before the Secretary of State for India in Council tiiu following observations on the recommendations contained therein. (1) It is noted that four additional lights are recommended, one of these being a port light at Debai, and the other three to be placed at intervals of about 100 miles between Kishm and Bushire, and I am to state that the desirability of these lights is concurred in, and that the positions proposed for them appear to be Judiciously selected with a view to future development, as well as to me et present needs. (2) The proposals stated in the report are concurred in, subject to the following remarks (a) BUNDER ABBAS .- The proposed light buoy to mark the shoals extending off Kishm point would be a very desirable addition. In the event of its becoming necessary to adopt the alternative proposal of a light, vessel of small type, it is possible that an acetylene gas buoy might be less expensive and equally efficient. (b) BUSHIRE .- The necessity for a light vessel in the Outer Anchorage is not concurred in, unless political considera tions should render the establishment of a shore light Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE. undesirableundesirable. There are no detached-off lying dangers, and the soundings shoa] gradually from the 30 fathom line up to the beach. An unwatched 15 mile light at Ras al Shaghet would appear therefore to meet navigational requirements, in view of the fact that the lignt would be little over two miles inside the 5 fathom line. A gas buoy in the outer anchorage in connection with the light on shore would be desirable, and in their Lordships* opinion would meet the case. (c) KQWETT .- It is considered that a 15 mile light at Kubbar Island would suffice, and that the advantage of the greater range of 20 miles would not justify the additional cost involved in the height of the structure. The present chart of the approaches to Kubbar Island should be replaced by modern surveys before the establishment of a light, (d) BAHREIN .- A re-survey of the approaches to this port is very much required to enable the most suitable position for lights to be definitely determined. If it should be impracticable to place a 20 mile light on Fasht al Dibal, the proposal to place a lightship in the position named is concurred in. In their Lordships* opinion a floating light near the present outer buoy would be preferable to a light on Muharrak. An acetylene gas buoy might prove to be suitablefor this position. The question should be considered in the light of information on the new form of buoy which it is anticipated that Trinity House will shortly be in a position to furnish. (e) The order of importance of the proposed lights is concurred in, and also the proposals for improving buoyage. I am to add that my Lords will be glad to be informed to what extent it is proposed to carry out the recommendations of the Committee. Copy of this letter has been sent to tb 3 Foreign Office. I am.

In consideimg tlie establishment of lighthouses, hg’ht vessels, buoj’s, an cl other sea marks in the Persian Gulf, I propose to approach the subject mainly from the point of view of construction and maintenance ; and, while fully hi agreement with the order of importance attributed to the proposed lights in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry, I have, for the time being, set aside all claims to priority in navigational importance in favour of tho?e offering the greatest facilities, and consequent economy, from an engineering standpoint. Finally, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to reconcile the navigational and constructional requirements. In some cases alternative proposals to those recommended by the Committee are put forward, as the result of further personal investigation since I left the Persian Gulf, or are suggested by the probable expenditure after the preparation of the estimates. In regard to the scheme generally as prepared and advocated by the Committee of Enquiry, I would draw attention to the abstract statement of lights proposed by the British India officers at the beginning of the Report, and would state that, since the Committee dispersed, I have had numerous opportunities of confidentially discussing the lighting of the Persian Gulf with masters of vessels engaged in navigating these waters, including some of those whose opinions had previously been submitted to us, and discovered, without divulging the recommendations of the Committee, that the scheme proposed would meet with, practically, universal favour. In submitting estimates for each of the proposed lighthouses, it has been assumed that all materials which require to be imported into the Gulf will be carried by regular trading steamers to the nearest port, and be taken thence, landed, and delivered on the site by the proposed lighthouse tender and her crew, as the services of an attendant steamship are considered essential in the interests of works on sites of such isolation and inaccessi bility. No allowance has, therefore, been made in the estimates for freight on material after it leaves the trading steamer, except the hire of native craft for barge work where necessary. Where portions of any works demand fresh water for building construction or other purposes, it has been assumed that such water will be delivered on the site by the steamer if it cannot be procured locally. Nor has allowance been made for the purchase of land for lighthouses or other works. In Paper No. 189, dated 5th November 1908, embodying the official correspondence in regard to the construction of a lighthouse at Ras al Arz,r it is recommended (page 11 ) that the work be executed by experienced lighthouse constructors from England. I have, therefore, assumed that all lighthouses &amp;c. in the Persian Gulf will be erected by a Superintendent of Works of ’the Constructive Staff of Trinity House, and by lighthouse mechanics where necessary, all skilled labour being procured from India, and unskilled labour from the locality m which the work is being executed, and that none of the lighthouses will be erected by contract. O Lighthouse Tender. necessity for tlie provision of a steamship to serve exclusively m the caoacitv of lighthouse tender has been pointed out by the Committee of EnouirV The cost of construction and maintenance of this steamer would form very considerable items in any scheme for establishing lights m the Persian Gulf Possibly, however, the Royal India Marine have at their disnosal an existing vessel which, if possible to release from other duties, could at comparatively small cost be fitted and adapted for use as a lighthouse ten sL f shouid d hav 1 e t a good hold and good deck accommodation for the conveyance of stores and buoys, be fitted with storage gas receivers and compressor for charging buoys or light vessels, and have a powerful winch and derrick for dealing easily with weights up to 8 tons at sea. Her capacity for water storage or distilling, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should not be overlooked. 1 , , ^ Should a suitable vessel of the Royal India Marine not be available, and it becomes necessary to build a new ship, with proper appliances and permanent living accommodation for officers and crew, she would m all probability require a displacement of approximately 800 tons I estimate her cost delivered in the Persian Gulf after construction m England, at 30,0001 The'Indian Government, from their own experience, will be able to estimate what her annual maintenance would^ be in the East, but it would probably amount to about 5 , 000 Z. per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, coal, stores, The Committee of Enquiry recommend that one of the officers of the skip should be a qualified surveyor, and 1 would further suggest that her Com mander hold the appointment of Superintendent of Lighthouses, and be responsible for the proper maintenance of all lighthouses, light vessels, and buoys. The engineer of the ship should be fully trained to overhaul and adjust all working parts of all lights, including clocks, rollers, buoy flashers, &amp;c., and be thoroughly grounded in the management and adjustment of modern lighthouse burners. Lighthouses. As already stated, the order of navigational importance as tabulated m the report of the Committee of Enquiry should, for constructional expediency, be departed from to a slight degree. ,. , , . , In the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, the first lighthouse m the Gulf should be established at Little Quoin, Musandam. The establishment of a lighthouse on Little Quoin, however, would be dependent on the attendance of the lighthouse steamer ; and, if it is the intention of the Government of India to proceed forthwith with a lighting scheme, I would point out that, as the services of the steam tender are not required for the construction and maintenance of the proposed works at Muscat, Linga, and Debai, the establishment of these lights could be undertaken during the period in which the proposed lighthouse tender is under construction or adaptation. Then, on the arrival of the steam tender m the Gulf, the construction of the Little Quoin lighthouse could be proceeded with ; and considerable economy would be effected if Little Quoin and Tanb Island lighthouses were built simultaneously, as they are close together and could both be attended to easily and conveniently by the ship, while allowing her ample time to attend periodically to the requirements of any floating or othei lights that may meantime have been established in the Gull.al Arz , Bl,shire &gt; Kubbar - Ras undertaken separately and in any reauireT ° f the strHct . ures ' could be?

I he cost of establishing gasworks, erecting a small workshop oil storage tanks store houses, offices, forming buoy yard, and boundary walls woutd piobably entail an expenditure of about complete with spare lioht vessel, gas buoys, unlit buoys, moorings, and general equipment, but noth'fim ms been allowed m this estimate for the purchase of land, or any proportion of the cost of the proposed pier. y P ro P oruon On the assumption that the work already contemplated by the Govern ment at JXoweit will be commenced immediately, matters would be considerably simplified if the establishment of the lighthouse depot formed a pait of the Admiralty scheme, and if the work could be carried out bv their constructive staff. J 0 It is assumed that Koweit will shortly he placed in telegraphic communication with Bushire. ' 8 pmc Ihe cost of maintaining the depot is covered by the corresponding amounts given for each of the proposed lights. Light Vessels. Simultaneously with the building or adaptation of the steam tender the construction of one or more light vessels could he undertaken. They should be modelled, both as regards hull and lighting apparatus, on the most recent rmity House practice; and I would suggest that thev he copper-sheathed composite ships, about 85 feet in length. Each ship should he fitted with storage gas holders for the maintenance of a dioptric light, similar to those on this principle established successfully in France and England. ^ Ihe dioptric apparatus should consist of large fourth order panels of 375 m/m. focal distance, and each ship should be arranged to show a sino-le flashing white light, so that she could be removed from, or placed on, any station without alteration. This can be done without any possible confusion of lights. They should be fitted with 2-wick capillary stand-by lamps. In England the crew of such a vessel consists of six men, i.e., four on hoard and two on relief; but in the Persian Gulf I would suggest ’ that the crew consist of six men on board and two on relief. I estimate the cost of such a vessel, complete, with moorings on her station in the Gulf, at approximately 9,500L, and the maintenance at about 650b per annum, inclusive of wages, stores, periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against the ship for the maintenance of the 'depot at Koweit.4 I am of opinion that the construction of these ships should not be undertaken in India. A dioptric ship is of special form, and should be unuertaKen rid; have ller lenses balanced, the swing of the vessel determined, and the period of the pendulum finally adjusted to it under the ^re'rstlhlp^omptted^ight be towed to the Gulf by the new light house tender, and the others could be sailed to Port Said and towed from there to the Gulf by the tender sent round specially for that purpose. AH proposals as to lightships and lighted buoys are put forward nrovisionally as the illumination of all descriptions of floating lights is on the eve of very important, and, I confidentally anticipate successful development. The estimates of first cost and maintenance may, however, be Qppprtted as covering figures in any case. Muscat (see Appendix L). The summit of Has Muscat is at present practically inaccessible and a zig-zag path with occasional steps would require to be made to the top The 'flat P reef below the headland, and on which a landing can easily be effected requires making up with concrete, and considerable excavation would be necessary on the summit of the headland to form a shel or plateau on which the necessary buildings could be erected. Pl The tower and dwellings should be constructed of masonry the former being only about 12 feet b inches high, floor to floor this would place the for*Tire of the light at an elevation of about 2 o 0 feet above high water, OT sufficient for a geographical range of about 22 miles. The necessary Hving and storage accommodation should consist of living room sleeping ronm oil store fuel store, general store-room, and watei storage tanks. iCprTvSon of a low retaining wall around the plateau might be found necessary as the surface rock on the summit is very loose. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of about ' 34 second duration every 5 seconds. The intensity wuhl fee about 100,000 candles with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle ol oo m/r in the focus of the lens. . ,. i yuot- I estimate approximately, from the information at my disposal, that t cost oi establishing such a lighthouse, complete with lantern, lighting apparatus, dwelling and stores, and inclusive of forming a landing place, approaches to the summit, temporary stores, and living quarters for supen - tendents and workmen, would be about, 8 , 000 L, and the annual maintenance inclusive of oil, stores, wages and repairs, at about ooOL, an amount that would cover the sum annually chargeable against Muscat for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. . . • • i- I consider that the establishment necessary ior maintaining this hgiit should consist of six men (natives of Muscat), who should be chosen y e Superintendent of Works and the erecting mechanic, m consultation with me British Political Resident at Muscat, from amongst the labourers employ eci on the works, and who will have been under observation for a considerable time by these officers. It would then be the duty of the erecting niec amc to instruct them in the management of the burners and everything in. eir if would be necessary for Muscat lighthouse to be maintained as a lock station,” i.e., the men only residing at the lighthouse and their lamilies m the town. Four men would, therefore, always be on duty at the lighthouse, with two on relief. Little Quoin (see Appendices II. and III.). On the completion of Muscat lighthouse, the workmen s hving^ qnaiteis, cement store and plant should be conveyed to the Little Quoin by lighthouse tender, and the construction of the lighthouse on the island The most convenient landing place is at the north-west point, hut to face up the rock so as to render the landing of men stores ^sy and execute the necessary protective work to the cliff over the landing place,r5ndiUire gh PreSeiUin 8 little constructional difficulty, entail considerable site^rfeft^W^fgh water.

A site for a lighthouse was selected near a small gully just bevond the extreme water tank to the southward of Kishm Town the site being ablut 100 yards from the sea. ° Good building materials except for concrete work, are not available locally and I would suggest that the tower be a braced cast-iron structure about 65 feet high from ground to gallery. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 86 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of lo miles as recommended by the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry. ^ The light should, I consider, be Third Order occulting, and show red between the bearings of about S. 14° E. and S. 66 ° E. over Larak Island, its charactei should be one occultation every 20 seconds. With an incun descent oil burner, having a mantle of 55 m/m diameter in the focus of tbe lens, the intensity would be about 9,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the lighthouse, inclusive of tower ' lantern, lighting apparatus, stores, dwellings, &amp;c., complete at 7 5001 and ^annual maintenance, inclusive of wages, stores, repairs, and p’aintino- at 4001., which sum would cover all amounts chargeable against Kishm for°the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. Kishrn lighthouse would rank as a shore station, the establishment con sistmg of four men, who should live with their families in dwellings erected near the tower. With regard to the proposed lighted buoy off Kishm Point, I estimate its cost, with lantern and moorings complete on its station, at 600Z and its annual maintenance at 40L, inclusive of gas, cleaning, periodical overhaul and depot charges. c ’6 In regard to . altern^ire proposalto establkh ^a small^pe o! ^ight S^cuCg light of about 500 candle power, at 6,0001. complete boat, Ulth an occ = ? &amp;c The maintenance of such a vessel would on her station, u it ,“’2501 per annum, inclusive of gas, stores, ^SalCrhaul, and all sums chargeable against her by the depot at PP •, i nnrl freniient attention by a local man.

The site is about 105 feet above high water, b ut a s there are several points on the island nearly as high as the proposed she f would suggest that, in order to reduce the shadows cast seaward by them the towerbe 30 feet high.

Its maintenance would only require the partial time of one man for extinguishing and cleaning purposes in the morning and for lighting up and hoisting into position at night. Shaikh Shuaib (see Appendix VI.). I he best position for a lighthouse is, as indicated by the Committee of Enquiry, near the S.W. point of the island. ^ ^-he_ towei should, I consider, be a braced cast-iron structure about 85 feet in height from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 120 feet above high water. The resultant geographical range would be about 17 miles, or rather more than is recom mended by the Committee; but the slight additional height allowed for in the tower is to obtain a satisfactory bearing of the light over the higher land to the eastward. From this elevation the light would, in all probability show from N. through W. and S. to E. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows :— Flash _ _ _ _ Eclipse _ _ _ Flash - - Eclipse - - '34 second. - 1'5 - ‘34 „ - 7'82 seconds. Total period - lO'OO The intensity would be about 100,000 candles.

The four keepers should, I consider, be natives of the island, and reside with their families in quarters erected near the tower. Shaikh Shuaib would, therefore, be a shore station, and require no regular relief. Ras al Mutaf. The type of floating light proposed for establishment at Ras al Mutaf is described provisionally under light vessels, where it is also estimated that her first cost would be about 9,500b and her annual maintenance about 650b The light should show one flash every 10 seconds, and the intensity would be approximately 40,000 candles. Bushire. As suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, the most efficient means of lighting the approach to Bushire is by means of a light vessel placed near the outer anchorage.

[Summary op Proposals and Alternatives.Any further communication on this subject should be addressed to THE SECRETARY, TRINITY HOUSE, TOWER HILL, LONDON, E.C., and the following letter and number '‘'‘'Ndd be quoted: B. 2536/1909 Telegraphic Address — DIOPTRIC, LONDON. With Chart ©nutty fmtsr, lunfton, 30th June 1909. v &gt;. ;r'' Sir, 6061 in, X X^03aT3&gt; With reference to the demi-official correspondence whicn nas recently passed between the India Office and this House on the subject of the proposed better lighting of the Persian Gulf, I am now directed to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying supplementary report by Mr. Hood, which deals with the question of first cost, maintenance r and other details in respect of the proposed scheme for improving the ligating, &amp;c. of the Persian Gulf as prepared by the Committee of Inquiry vshich recently visited the locality. I am to add that Mr. Hood states that he is in possession^n nearly every case referred to in his report y of suf j. icient information/(although it is not so detailed as it would have been had more time been available), to enable any of the woris referred to to be proceeded with if required. The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S. W. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,r\ REPORT by TO ^ of a Committee of Enquiry on the LIGHTING and 6U0YAGL of the PERSIAN GDLP. In considering the establishment of Lighthouses, Light Vessels, Buoys, and other sea marks in the Persian Gulf, I propose to approach the subject mainly from the point of view of construction and maintenance; and, while fully in agreement with the order of importance attributed to the proposed lights in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry, I have, for the time being, set aside all claims to priority in navigational importance in favour of those offering the greatest facilities, and consequent economy, from an engineering standpoint. Finally I have endeavoured as far as possible to reconcile the navigational and constructional requirements* recommended by the Committee are put forward, as the result of further personal investigation since I left the Persian Gulf, or are suggested by the probable expenditure after the preparation of the estimates. In regard to the scheme generally as prepared and advocated by the Committee of Enquiry, I would draw attention to In some cases alternative proposals to those thethe Abstract Statement of Lights proposed by the B.I. officers at the beginning of the report, and would state that, since the committee dispersed, I have had numerous opportunities of confidentially discussing the lighting of the Persian Gulf with * * ^ masters of vessels engaged in navigating these waters, including some of those whose opinions had previously been submitted to us, and discovered,—without divulging the recommendations of the Committee,—that the scheme proposed would meet with, practically, universal favour. In submitting estimates for each of the proposed lighthouses, it has been assumed that all materials which require to be imported into the Gulf will be carried by regular trading steamers to the nearest port, and be taken thence, landed, and delivered on the site by the proposed lighthouse tender and her crew, as the services of an attendant steamship are considered essential in the interests of works on sites of such isolation and inaccessibility. No allowance has, therefore, been made.in the estimates for freight on material after it leaves the trading steamer, except the hire of native craft for barge work where necessary. Where portions of any works demand fresh water for building-Construction or other purposes, it has been assumed that such water will be delivered on the site by the steamer if it cannot be procured locally.' Nor has allowance been made for the tmbc&amp;ase3 purchase of land for lighthouses or other irorks. In t'aper Ko. Iby, dated 5th NoveiDber 1^08, embodying the official correspondence in regard to the construction of a lighthouse at Ras al Arz, it is recommended (page 11) that the work be executed by experienced lighthouse constructors from England* I have, therefore, assumed that all lighthouses etc, in the Persian Gulf will be erected by a Superintendent of Works of the oonstructive Staff of Trinity House, and by lighthouse mechanics where necessary, all skilled labour being procured from India, and unskilled labour from the locality in which the work is being executed, and that none of the lighthouses will be erected by contract. Lighthouse Tender, c. Ihs necessity for the provision of a steamship to serve exclusively in the capacity of Lighthouse Tender has been pointed out by the Committee of Enquiry. The cost of construction and maintenance of this steamer nould form very considerable items in any scheme for establishing lights in the Persian Gulf. Possibly, hoifever, the fioyal India Marine have at their disposal an existing vessel which, if possible to release from other duties, could at comparatively small cost be fitted and adapted for use as a lighthouse tender for the district. SheShe should bare a good hold and good desk aooo M oda- tion for the oonreyanoe of stores and buoys, be fitted with storage gas receivers and compressor for charging buoys or light vessels, and hare a powerful winch and derrick for dea^ffcth weights up to 8 tons at sea. Her capacity for water storage or distilling, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should not be overlooked. Should a suitable vessel of the H.I.M, not be available, and it becomes necessary to build a new ship, with proper appliances and permanent living accommodation for officers and crew, she would in all probability require a displacement of approximately 800 tons. I estimate her cost, delivered in the Persian Gulf after construction in England, at £30,000. The Indian Government, from their own experience, will be able to estimate what her annual maintenance would be in the East, but it would probably amount to about £5,000 per annum, inclusive of - wages, repairs, coal, stores, and all charges. Committee of Enquiry recommend that one of the ficero of the ship should be a qualified surveyor, and I would _ - further suggest that her Commander hold the appointment of Superintendent of Lighthouses, and be responsible for the proper maint^nan^.. of all lighthouses, light vessels, and buoys. The Engineer of the ship should be fully trained to overhaul and adjust5. all working parts of all lights, including clocks, rollers, buoy flashars eto*, and be thoroughly grounded in the management and adjustment of modern lighthouse burners. Lighthouses. \ c As already stated, the order of navigational importance as tabulated in the report of the Committee of inquiry should, for constructional expediency, be departed from to a slight degree. In the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, the first lighthouse in the Gulf should be established at Little Quoin, Musandam, The establishment of a lighthouse on Little Quoin, however, would be dependent on the attendance of the lighthouse steamer; and, if it is the intention of the Government of India to proceed forthwith with a lighting scheme, I would point out that, as the services of the steam tender are not required for the construction and maintenance of the proposed works at Muscat, Linga, and Debai, the establishment of these lights could be undertaken during the period in which the proposed lighthouse tender is under construction or adaptation. Then, on the arrival of the steam tender in the Gulf, the construction of the Little Quoin Lighthouse could be proceeded with; and considerable economy would be effected if Little Quoin and Tanb Island Light- , _ . ^ *i as arQ olose together, houses #ere built simultaneouslyand oould both be atteuded to easilyeasily and oonvaniently by tha ship, while allowing her ample time to attend periodically to the requirements of any floating or other lights that may meantime have been established in the Gulf. The construction of lighthouses at Shaikh Shuaib, Bushire, Kubbar, Ras al Arz, and Kishin, from the different nature of the structures, could be undertaken separately and in any required sequence, as in these cases continual attention by the ship would not be so essential. In all cases I would recommend that the illuminant adopted for lighthouses in the Persian Gulf be ordinary lighthouse paraffin. As incandescen^urners of the M Chanee M type are already installed on the coast of India, I would suggest that the same system be adopted for the lights now under discussion, as the lighthouse officials appointed to the Gulf will in all probability have had some experience of these burners in Burma, Madras, and other portions of the Indian Coast. In regard to machinery and the working parts of each lighthouse, only mechanism of the simplest nature is recommended, in view of its maintenance by local keepers. Depdt. ^ * While the earliest works are in progress in the Gulf, the establishment of the gas works should be completed. The site fw*for the Depot and Gas Sorks which appeared to me to offer the * greatest advantages in the Persian Gulf was the shore of the Sweikh Channel at Koweit, when it transpired that a portion of the adjoining land had already been secured by the British Government. I subsequently inferred, and have assumed, that the construction of a pier or jetty at this point is in contemplation, and that part of this British land will be placed at the disposal of the lighthouse authorities for the establish ment of a buoy yard, gas works, etc., and that the pier or jetty will be available for the use of the lighthouse service. Ihe cost of establishing gas works, erecting a small workshop, oil storage tanks, store houses, offices, forming buoy yard, ana boundary walls, would probably entail an expenditure of about £22,000, complete with spare light vessel, gas buoys, unlit buoys, moorings, and general equipment, but nothing has been allowed in this estimate for the purchase of land, or any proportion of the cost of the proposed pier. On the assumption that the work already contemplated by the bovernment at Koweit will be commenced immediately, matters would be considerably simplified if the establishment of the lighthouse DepSt formed a part of the Admiralty scheme, and if the work could be carried out by their constructive staff. It is assumed that Koweit will shortly be placed in telegraphic communication with Bushire. f h©I Ihe oost of maintaining the Depot is covered by the corresponding amounts given for each of the proposed lights. Light Vessels. ^ Simultaneously with the building or adaptation of the steam tender, the construction of one or more light vessels could be undertaken. They should be modelled, both as regards hull and lighting apparatus, on the most recent Trinity Douse practice; and I would suggest that they be copper-sheathed composite ships about 85 feet in length. Each ship should be fitted with storage gas holders for the maintenance of a dioptric light, similar t,o those on this principle established successfully in France and England. The dioptric apparatus should consist of large Fourth Order panels of 375 m/m focal distance, and each ship should be arranged to show a single-flashing white light, so that she could be removed from, or placed on, any station without alteration. This can be done without any possible confusion of lights. They should be fitted with 2-wick capillary stand-by lamps. In England the crew of such a vessel consists of 6 men, i.e,, four on board and two on relief; but in the Persian Gulf I would suggest that the crew consist of six men on board and two on relief.I estimate the cost of such a vessel, complete with moorings on her station in the Gulf, at approximately £9,500, and the maintenance at about £650 per annum, inclusive of wages, stores, periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against the ship for the maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. I am of opinion that the construction of these ships should not be undertaken in India* A dioptric ship is of special form, and should be trimmed for proper riding, have her lenses balanced, the swing of the vessel determined, and the period of the pendulum finally adjusted to it under the supervision of experts at home. The first ship completed might be towed to the Gulf by the new lighthouse tender, and the others could be sailed to Port Said and towed from there to the Gulf by the tender sent round specially for that purpose. All proposals as to lightships and lighted buoys are put forward provisionally, as the illumination of all descriptions of floating lights is on the eve of very important and, I confident ly anticipate, successful development. The estimates of first cost and maintenance may, however, be accepted as covering figures in any case. Muscat. ^JL- Ihe summit of Ras Muscat is at present practically inaccessible10 . inaccessible, and a zig-zag path with occasional steps would require to be made to the top. The flat reef below the headland. ana on which a landing can easily be effected, requires making up with concrete, and considerable excavation would be necessary on the summit of the headland to form a shelf or plateau on which the necessary buildings could be erected. C' The tower and dwellings should be constructed of masonry, the former being only about 12 feet 6 inches high, floor to floor. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 250 feet above High Sfater, or sufficient for a geographical range of about 22 miles. The necessary living and storage accommodation should consist of living room, sleeping room, oil store, fuel store, general store-room, and water storage tanks. The provision of a low retaining wall around the plateau might be found necessary, as the surface rock on the summit is very loose. Ihe light should, 1 consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of about .34 second duration every 5 seconds. The intensity would be about 100,000 candles with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m in the focus of the lens. 1 estimate approximately, from the information at my A disposal, that the cost of establishing such a lighthouse, complete with lantern, lighting apparatus, dwelling and stores, and11 . and inclusive of forcing a landing place, approaches to the su.ait temporary stores, and living quarters for superintendents and workmen, would be about £ 8 , 000 , and the annual maintenance, inclusive of oil, stores, wages and repairs, at about £350, an amount that would cover the sum annually chargeable against Muscat for the maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. 1 consider that the establishment necessary for maintaining this light should consist of six men (natives of Muscat), who should be chosen by the Superintendent of Works and the erecting mechanic, in consultation with the British Political Resident at Muscat, from amongst the labourers employed on the works, and who will have been under observation for a considerable time by these officers. It would then be the duty of the erecting mechanic to instruct them in the management of the burners and everything in their charge. It would be necessary for Muscat Lighthouse to be maintained as a 'rock station', i.e. the men only residing at the lighthouse and their families in the town. four men would, therefore, always be on duty at the lighthouse, with two on relief. Little Quoin. ^~... / ' ~ , ///.. . On the completion of Muscat Lighthouse, the workmen's living quarters, cement store and plant should be conveyed to the Little—12 . Littls Quoin by the lighthouse tender, and the construction of the lighthouse on the island begun. The most convenient landing place is at the N.S. point; but to face np the rock so as to render the landing of men and stores easy, and execute the necessary protective work to the cliff over the landing place, *ould, though presenting little construction difficulty, entail considerable expenditure. ^The edge of the cliff at the south end is 154 feet high, and the proposed site 134 feet above High Water. ihe toner should be of masonry, 30 feet high from base to gallery, nhich would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 175 feet above High Water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. 'this light—one of the most important in the Gulf,. should, I consider, be of the Second Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows: B'lash .23 second i&amp;lipse 1.54 0 Flash .23 “ C -'T Ficlipse 8.00 seconds Total Period 10.00 ” Ihe intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/ffi in the focus of the lens, would be about 200,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the light, inclusive of landing place, cliff protective work, tower, dwellings. stores.13 . stores, lantern and lighting apparatus complete at £12,500, and the annual maintenance at £400, inclusive of all stores, wages, structural repairs, and charges against the Little Quoin Light house for the maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. The lighthouse should be maintained as a rock station, 5 keepers only living on the island. The establishment should ssist of six men, four on duty and two on relief. Probably a vety frequent relief of the Little Quoin lighthouse would be necessary in the Summer months, as it is characterised climatically as the worst place in the Gulf. Bundar Abbas are suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, viz:- 1- A Lighthouse near KishmTown, in conjunction with a lighted buoy at the seaward extreme of the shoals off Kishm Point, or 2. A small light vessel or gas boat alone in the latter position. A site for a lighthouse was selected near a small gully just beyond the extreme water tank to the southward of Kishm lown, the site being about 100 yards from the sea. Good building materials, except for concrete work, are Bundar Abbas Alternative proposals for lighting the approaches to not14 . &amp;&gt; not available locally, and I would suggest that the tower be a braced cast-iron structure about 65 feet high from ground to gallery. This would place the focal plane of the light at an ^Iwvation of about 86 feet above High Water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 15 miles as recommended by the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry. ihe light should, I consider, be Third Order occulting, and show red between the bearings of about S. 14°E and S. 66° E. over Larak Island. Its character should be one occultation every 20 seconds. With an incandescent oil burner, having a mantle of 55 m/m diameter in the focus of the lens, the intensity would be about 9,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the lighthouse, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, stores.dwellings etc. complete at £7,500, and its annual maintenance, inclusive of wages, stores, repairs and painting at £400, which sum would cover all amounts chargeable against Kishm for the maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. Kishm Lighthouse would rank as a shore station, the establishment consisting of four men, who should live with their families in dwellings erected near the tower. ■&lt;ith regard to the proposed lighted buoy off Kishm I estimate its cost, with lantern and moorings complete on its15 . its station, at £600, and its annual maintenance at £40, inclusive of gas, cleaning, periodical overhaul and Depot charges. In regard to the alternative proposal to establish a small type of light vessel off Kishm Point, I estimate the cost of placing an unattended gas boat, with an occulting light of about 500 candle power, at £6,000 complete on her station, with moorings etc. The maintenance of such a vessel would probably amount to about £250 per annum, inclusive of gas, stores, periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against her by the ^epot at Koweit, and periodical and frequent attention by a local man. Either of these schemes for lighting the approaches to Bundar Abbas involves considerable expense both in first cost and annual maintenance, to obviate which a third and possible alternative suggests itself, viz. to establish a small outer light on the Hast end of Larak Island, and a lighted buoy at the Euphrates Patch $est of Hormuz* As already stated, the first cost and annual main tenance of the buoy souId be £600 and £40 respectively, inclusive of all Depot charges. A navigator coula ascertain his position in approaching the port from any direction by the Little Quoin light, and all that would be necessary to guide him safely past Larak is a small light of16. iltf of short range to mark the end of the island. If this were a standard semi-watched port light, it could be attended to by a native of the adjoining village. No provision would be necessary for living quarters, as would probably be the case if the light were established on the $est end of the island. A light of only 5 miles range on the East end of Larak would, it appears to me, be as efficient as a 15-mile light Kishm Point, if the lighting of the approaches to Bundar Abbas be restricted to one channel only. In addition to the cost of the proposed buoy at the Euphrates Patch, the establishment of a port light on Larak Island would involve an expenditure of £450, inclusive of a small corrugated iron oil store etc., and would, I consider, be maintained at an annual cost of about £ 35 , inclusive of all Depdt charges. The estimate of first cost of this port light provides for an erecting mechanic being already employed in the Gulf, as ! no provision has been made for sending a man specially from India or England to erect the light. Ihe best site for a lighthouse on Tanb is the summit of the island, a flat tableland near the O. side. Good building stone is available, and I would suggest that17 . that the premises be constructed of masonry. The site is about 1 16^ feet above High ftater; but, as there are several points on ) the island nearly as high as the proposed site, I would suggest that, in order to reduce the shadows cast seaward by them, the tower be SO feet high. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 200 feet above High Water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. Ibe light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, V and show one flash of .34 second duration every 5 seconds, the intensity being about 100,000 candles. 1 estimate the cost of establishing this light, complete with tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus, at about £7,500, and its maintenance at £850 per annum, which would cover all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. lanb Lighthouse should rank as a shore station, the establishment consisting of four keepers, who should live with their families in dwellings erected beside the tower. These men should, if possible, be natives of the island. Debai. The site selected for the proposed light at Debai is on the sea front. The structure should be a column 20 feet high. and18 . and the light (fixed red, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry) should be shown from a Fourth Order port light. It would be of about 200 candle power, which would probably give an effective range of 5 miles, and often more in very clear weather. The light could, I estimate, be maintained for about \ £35 per annum, and I estimate the first cost, inclusive of column, lantern, stores, and corrugated iron oil store at approximately £450 if carried out at a time when other work was in hand in the locality, and an expert erector was available. Linga. The site selected for a light at Linga is the centre of the courtyard of the new offices of the B. I. Company, in which position I would suggest that a high column, with four stays, be erected. The light, fixed red as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should be so arranged that the lantern is hoisted nightly on the mast or column. It should be a Fourth Order port *■ light, the establishment of which would not, I estimate, exceed £600 if carried out at a time when other work was in hand in the locality. Such a light would probably be maintained at an annual cost of £3o, inclusive of all Depot charges. Its maintenance would only require the partial time of oneone man for extinguishing and cleaning purposes in the morning, and for lighting up and hoisting into position at night. Shaikh Shuaib. ( Ihe best position for a lighthouse is, as indicated by the Committee of Enquiry, near the S.W, point of the island. Ihe tower should, I consider, be a braced cast-iron structure about 85 feet in height from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 120 feet above High A 1 a ter. The resultant geographical range would be about 17 miles, or rather more than is recommended by the Committee; but the slight additional height allowed for in the tower is to obtain a satisfactory bearing of the light over would, in all probability, show from N. through W. and S. to E. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows: M' Flash - .34 second Eclipse 1.5 Flash .34 0 Eclipse 7.82 seconds 4 Total Period 10.00 the higher land to the eastward. From this elevation the light The intensity would be about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing such a light, inclusiveinclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores,^etc. complete at £ 8 , 000 , and its maintenance at £400 per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for tne maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. The four keepers should, 1 consider, be natives of the island, and reside with their families in quarters erected near the tower. Shaikh Shuaib would, therefore, be a shore station, and require no regular relief. Ras al Mutaf. Ihe type of floating light proposed for establishment at Ras al Mutaf is described provisionally under light vessels, where it is also estimated that her first cost would be about £9,500 and her annual maintenance about £650. The light should show one flash every 10 seconds, and the intensity would be approximately 40,000 candles. Bushire. As suggested by the Committee of Enquiry,- the most efficient means of lighting the approach to Bushire is by means of a light vessel placed near the outer anchorage. The cost of establishing a suitable ship would be about £9,500, and her annual maintenance approximately £650, as already stated for Ras al Mutaf. ihe light could be single flashing every 10 seconds, with an intensityintensity of about 40,000 candles. The alternative scheme, as indicated by the Committee, is a lighthouse on shore. I he first cost and maintenance of a light vessel as compared with a lighthouse would be, of course, considerably greater, though the difference would probably not be so marked in this instance as in England; still, the establishment and maintenance of a large floating light would be heavy items of expenditure for a port like Bushire. To obviate this, I would suggest yet another scheme, which is in effect a simple combination of the recommendations of the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry, viz: a lighthouse on Ras as Shaghab and a gas buoy with a large lantern and a high and conspicuous top- mark outside the 5-fathom line, so that in hazy weather even in daytime a vessel would not over-run the anchorage. A lighthouse on Kas as Shaghab should be a braced cast-iron structure as recommended for Shaikh Shuaib; and I estimate its cost, complete with tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, oil store etc. complete, at £ 8 , 000 , and its annual maintenance at £400, inclusive of all Depot charges. The light on shore should show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds, and be a duplicate of that proposed for Shaikh Shuaib.Ihe establishment should consist of four keepers, who would reside with their families in quarters beside the tower. I estimate the cost of establishing a large gas buoy in the outer* anchorage at £750, and its maintenance at £45 per annum, inclusive of all Dep 6 t charges. The light should be single occulting. The gas buoy proposed by the Committee of Enquiry for the inner anchorage at Ras al Marg would, I estimate, cost £600 complete on its station, and £40 for annual maintenance, inclusive of all Depot charges. % 1 refrain from stating the candle-power of proposed lighted buoys, in which connection I would draw attention to the last paragraph of my remarks under Light Vessels. Shat al Arab. The light vessel proposed to be established outside the Shat al Arab Bar should be in all respects similar to that described for Ras al Mutaf. The first cost would also be about £8,500, and the estimated annual maintenance £650. The light should be single flashing every 10 seconds, and the intensity about 40,000 candles. i* The crew is estimated to consist of eight men, viz. .f ' .1- six on board and two on relief.The advantages to be derived from this ship as a day mark cannot be over-estimated. Each of the lighted buoys proposed by the Committee of Enquiry for the Bar would, I estimate, cost about £600 complete in place, and involve an annual expenditure of £40 for maintenance, or a total first cost of aj2,400 and an aggregate maintenance of £160, inclusive of Dep 6 t charges. The characters of the lights could be: Outer Buoy No. 1 , Ditto No. 2 Ditto No. 3 Inner Buoy No. 4 one occultation every 10 seconds; two flashes ^ 10 ' ; one flash 10 * ; one occultation '10 M : The colour of all these lights should be white. Kubbar Island. M // All ships approaching Koweit from any direction make this island the landfall; and, as it is very low and flat,it is most difficult to pick up even in very clear weather, so that a lighthouse on Kubbar Island would be found almost as great a benefit as a daymark as the light by night. The proposed site is only about 6 feet above High •iiater. A cast-iron braced tower, similar to that recommended for shaikh Shuaib, would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 100 feet, or sufficient for the geographical rangerange of 15 miles recommended by the Committee of Enquiry. It would, I consider, be necessary to maintain this lighthouse as a rock station, the reliefs being effected from Koweit, living quarters for men only being provided on the island. I estimate the cost of the establishment of the light, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores etc^at 6 £6,500, and its maintenance at £400 per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the Depot at Koweit. ihe light should be of the Third Order, and show four flashes in quick succession every 15 seconds as follows’ u Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse .26 second 2.00 seconds .26 second 2.00 seconds .26 second 2.00 seconds .26 second 7.96 seconds Total Period 15.00 seconds. Ihe intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of oo rn/rn diameter in the focus of the lens, would be about 85,000 candles. Has al Arz. - - J'; v Ine most convenient and best site for a lighthouse at Kas al Arz is immediately in rear of the existing beacon, and nothing25. nothing is to be gained by placing the structure on the higher ground inland of this position, as suggested in paragraph 4 of a letter from Major Knox dated 21 st May 1907, and printed on Page 2 of Paper No. 189 dated 5th November 1908. The site there is of blown sand; and, though a lower tower would suffice, the foundations would be a very expensive item. The tower should be a braced cast-iron structure about 40 feet high, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 45 feet above High Water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 12 miles as recommended by the Committee of inquiry. It should, I consider, be of the Fourth Order, and show one white flash every 5 seconds. This light could be of a semi- watched nature, the luminary being a 2 -wick capillary lamp. A watchman is already maintained to guard the beacon, ana the provision of another keeper would complete the establish ment necessary for the requirements of such a light. With the proposed semi-watched system, the driving clock is arranged to maintain the light in action all night without re-winding, and the lamp to burn without attention. I estimate the cost of such a light, with tower, lantern and lighting apparatus, oil store, lighthouse store etc. complete, at £3,000, and its maintenance at £100 per annum, inclusive of all Depot charges. It26. It is noteworthy that the present watchman, a Bedouin, although provided with a house of two rooms of the usual native oonstruotion, does not occupy it, preferring to live with his family in a tent of native matting. Local opinion is against the provision of further permanent living quarters, as Bedouin prefer the tents. An oil store and lighthouse storeroom have, however, been provided for in the above estimate. The type of light provided for in the estimates embodied in pages 9 and 10 of Paper No. 189 of 1908 is, I consider, unsuitable for the position, and would not fulfil the conditions laid down by the Committee of Enquiry. The estimate for its establishment on the lines proposed is also inadequate. In estimating the cost of erecting the iron tower etc. it has been assumed that a foreman of works to supervise the construction of the foundations, and an erecting mechanic, are already engaged in the Persian Gulf, as no allowance has been made for the sea passages of skilled workmen from England, the employment of whom is recommended on Page 11 of Paper 189 dated 5th November 1908.

In view of the heavy cost anticipated by the Committee of inquiry entailed in erecting a lighthouse on Fasht ad Dibai, they suggest the alternative of placing a light vessel about 5 miles nortn of the reef. The cost of a suitable vessel complete on her station would be about £9,500, and her annual maintenance about £650. ine light from the light vessel should be single flashing28. fl8S “'‘ eW 10 S * 00 “' ls - “ a tte .bo»t 40,000 cote. ror. „f M „ llm ror „ rklIg the to babretn b s adopted, the Co-lttee of 6 a,„i P , p roposs , tet floating light be established near the present outer buoy to .ark the entrance to the channel.

Faeh of the gas buoys proposed for Kaseifa and iSest Spit would, I estimate, cost about £600 complete on its station, and involve an annual outlay of about £40.

If this argument be admitted, all that is necessary to render egress from the harbour is a gas buoy at, Kaseifa, and another gas buoy with a high and conspicuous superstructure for a day-mark near the present outer buoy* it is a matter for very serious consideration, however, whether the establishment of these two lights would not tend to induce men to use them for entering Bahrein, as it might involve considerable risk. I estimate the aggregate cost of these two gas buoys &amp;t £1,^50 complete on their stations, and their combined main tenance at £85 per annum, inclusive of all Depot charges. Beacon.

Dear Sir Richmond Ritchie, Please refer to your letter dated the 25th June 1909, advising the despatch of 6 printed copies of the Report of the Committee on the lighting and huoying of the Persian Gulf. Cox sent an advance copy of the Report to us and it has been printed here, so no further copies are required, thank you. Yours very truly, To Sir Richmond Ritchie, K.C.3., Secretary, Political Department, India Office.TRINITY BOOSE, LONDON, E.C 1st Jane 1908 Sir, I beg to inform you that I returned to London on the 30th ultimo, after visiting the Persian Gulf, and have the honour to enclose for your information a copy of the Report on Lighthouses drawn up by the Commission on the subject. The Chart, referred to in their Report is in course of preparation, and will be forwarded to you in a few days. I regret that, owing to the politically disturbed state of Persia, the work of the Commission was more hurriedly done than had been anticipated; so that, instead of estimates of first cost and maintenance being embodied in their Report, they will be shortly submitted in a supplementary Report which I have now in course of preparation. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant. J. L. Ferrard, Esq.B. 168* SECRET. 1909. ^This Document is the property^ of^ His Brkannie Majesty^s Gove rnment.] REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY ON THE LIGHTING AND BUOYAGE OF THE PERSIAN GULF. Members : Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. D. W. Hood, A.M.Inst.C.E., Trinity House. Commander S. Litchfield, R.N., H.M.S. “Sphinx.” Commander W. G. Beauchamp, R.I.M., in charge of the Marine Survey of India. 1. The object of this Committee was to gather information and examine locally the general question of the proposed lighting of the Persian Gulf and improvement of the buoyage. The subjects for examination were to include the number of lights and buoys required, the best sites for the erection of the former, with class of light most suitable in each case, and cost of erection, maintenance, &amp;c. 2. Major Cox was unable to leave Bushire owing to the state of affairs in Persia, but the other members of the Committee, accompanied by Captain Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident, commenced their investigations at Muscat ^ on 3rd April, when they embarked in the R.I.M.S. Lawrence.” Major Cox was subsequently able to join in the deliberations of the Committee at Bushire and is a party to the recommendations contained in this report. 3. The Committee were furnished with a copy of the report of an Admiralty conference on this question, and previous to the conclusion of their labours had the great advantage of meeting and conferring with Rear-Admiral E. J. Slade, M.Y.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, who was a member of that conference. The proposals contained in that report have been carefully examined on the spot, and some modifications and additions are recommended in view of local conditions and experience. Cost has also been taken into consideration. The Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who was confidentially consulted by the Committee at Bombay, furnished suggestions for lighting the Gulf obtained from six captains of Gulf mail steamers s. n. Ai 4. Abstract statement of the lights proposed by six officers in command of British India Steam Navigation Company’s mail steamers in Persian Gulf :— Place. Muscat Jask Has al Kuh Musandam Bunder Abbas Tanb Island Lingab Abu Musa Farur Island Nabiyu Farur Kais Island Proposed by Number of Officers indicated. Place. Proposed by Number of Officers indicated. 6 11 Shah All urn Shoal 2 11 Has al Mutaf 2 i/11 Bushire 6 11 Karag Island 1 I Shatt al Arab Bar 1 I Has al Arz 1 11 Kubbar Island 1 11 Farsi 2 11 Rennie Shoal X % 11 Bahrein 2 2 5 4 1 3 4 2 1 1 1 The above suggestions were, of necessity, rather hurriedly given, and would have been of greater value had they been put forward collectively instead of individually, and considerable divergence of opinion is apparent. The suggestions, however, include every place in the Gulf at which the establishment of a light could be reasonably entertained. Lights at Muscat, Musandam (Quoin), Bunder Abbas, Tanb, Lmgah, Ras al Mutaf, Bushire, Shatt al Arab Bar, Ras al Arz, Kubbar, and Bahrein are included in the recommendations of the Committee. The lighting of Kais received special consideration, but Shaikh bhuaib is recommended in preference. . „ . e Shah Allum and Rennie Shoals are undoubted dangers m the fairway ot ships making for Bahrein from the east and north respectively, but the lighting of these shoals is not considered to be warranted at present. ” The lighting of Farsi Island will be desirable in the event of material development of trade between the north of the Gulf and Bahrein. It is not recommended at present. . . . A light on Ras al Kuh would be useful to navigation, but is not recommended. It would be necessary to maintain an armed guard for its P It is not considered that lights are required at any of the other places mentioned. Existing Lights. 5 The only lights regularly exhibited in the Gulf at the P iese “* tl ' ue are those at Koweit and Fao. The former is a fixed red light visible five miles, recently installed by the Government of India at the British gencj . The Fao lights are maintained by the Turkish authorities and are too feeble to be of much service. i a.o O , K1 Tlle i Agen ‘' S ° f the British India Steam Navigation Company, at Bunder Abbas Lingah, Debai, and Koweit are in the habit of exhibiting a light on tneir premises when their steamers are expected. His Majesty’s ships sometimes arrange with officials of the Indo-European elegraph Stations at Bushire, Henjam, and Jask for a light to be hoisted when they expect to arrive at night. Proposed Scheme. 6. A comprehensive scheme of lighting the Gulf and its approach will necessitate the establishment of lights at the following places taken in geographical order :— Muscat. Musandam (Quoin). Bunder Abbas. Tanb. Lingah. Shaikh Shuaib. Pas al Mutaf. Bushire. Shatt al Arab Bar. Koweit. Bahrein. Debai. T he above hst includes the lighting at all places recommended by the Admnalty Conference with certain modifications (hereinafter detailed) for pk-Pn Ko '’ elt ’ aild Bunder Abbas &gt; and additional lights at Tanb Shaikh Shuaib, Pas al Mutaf, and Debai. g L ’ The object in view has been to provide lights at the most important salient points and outlying dangers for general guidance in the navigation of the Gulf and at the principal ports. Ihe lights at Tanb, Shaikh Shuaib, and Has al Mutaf are considered to be very necessary. They have an incidental advantage in completing an approximately equi-distant chain of lights. 8 Muscat. 240^”? ^ ° f ^ MuSCat&gt; Which has 311 e Wion oi 240 feet above high-water, is recommended as combining efficiency with greatesteconomy. This proposal is made after consideration of the folwTng 1. The entrance to Muscat harbour is remarkably blind, but the coast in the vicinity is bold and free from outlying dano-ers 2. The requirements of the port would be fulfilled by a'low-placed light o moderate power to indicate the entrance of the harbour 3. From a navigational point of view Fisher’s Rock offers an ideal site ut the cost of a safe structure, even for a small light, in such an exposed position would be very heavy. The alternative site on Ras Muscat is therefore recommended Com pared with Fisher’s Rock a light on Ras Muscat is less favourably placed n thick weather, which, however, is not frequent, and it is 1* cables inside the ymg danger; on the other hand it would serve the double purpose of a4 land fall and harbour light and has this additional advantage that ships bound from the Red Sea to the Gulf would pass well withm the range of the political difficulty with regard to the site is anticipated at Muscat The blue light shown on the chart of the harbour and referred to on page 41 of Gulf Pilot no longer exists, it was never very use u . Musakdam (Quoin). The Little Quoin provides a practical site for a light off Musandam and is strongly recommended in preference to Musandam Island or Lachal Island, tlie alternative sites considered. i i The Quoin is already accessible on its northern end, and landing arrangements can be made comparatively easy. . v Owing to the severity of the climate and scarcity of sweet water m this nart of the Gulf the establishment of an unwatched light was considered, but a li At of that description of sufficient power is rmpracticable. I 20-mile watched light is recommended. The site selected is 134 feet above high-water. Arrangements can be made for storage of water and for its supply in common with other isolated lights. Bunder Abbas. The Admiralty Conference proposed a 15-mile light on Kishm A suitable site, about one mile south of Kishm town ^ chart) was examined, a light at this position would guide a ship approa g Ttunrler Abbas through the western channel between Larak Island and Kishm but it is considered to be unfavourably situated without *6 addition “ buoy for rou^ U- •&gt;»'• “ ”1“ 1 point A red sector over Larak would be advisable, as o island are low In case political difficulties should arise in connection uitl the establishment of a light on Kishm Island it is recommended as an alternative that a light vessel of small type with range o should be moored on the outer extreme of the shoals off Kis p ■ It is considered that the adoption of the alternative proposal wh st largely overcoming any political difficulty, will effectively mark the shoal be of sufficient range to afford guidance through the western channe The establishment of a light on the Quoin to a large extent discounts urgency of an important light at Kishm. Ships approaching from the south will have a good departure from that light to pass east of Larak Ships approaching from the westward can, without greatly increasing their distance make the Quoin light and pass east of Larak if the weather is unfavourable for the passage of the western channel. A1 i t p e The present buoy marking the anchorage at urn ei property of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and should replaced by a buoy with a distinctive top mark. Kais, Tanb, and Shaikh Shuaib. The navigation of the gulf between Musandam and Shaikh Shum presents many dangers at night, notably the flat shoal .-^h o£ ^ Island, Tanb Island (in hazy weather), Farur Shoal, Kais Island, and Shuaib Island. p„if ;= regarded as important The efficient lighting of this portion of the Gulf is le^a and it will be convenient to consider it as a whole.0 invite “ Shaikh v «7 »!»»* &lt;* high land are paslTshai^rSWr 0 ' 8 t0 * ^ ^ ^ A ship bound west can obtain an approximate position to enable her to clear Ivars when passing Farur Island which is always risible on a clear dark night. Shaikh Shuaib is most dangerous to a ship hauling up to the northward after passmg lvais. A light on Kais would obviate the danger which that . pre ® ents and « lve a departure point for clearing Shaikh Shuaib south W T t eaVe , Slaikh Sll , Uaib an unma:r ked danger to ships bound Stlritem ' n0 ‘ t0 any fUtOTe deVel ° Pment 0f A light on Shaikh Shuaib will eliminate the danger of that island, and give a departure point for clearing Kais on an easterly course. Taking advantage of Farur Island as a night mark east of Kais, the lighting of Shaikh Shuaib in preference to Kais is indicated as the best means of eliminating the danger presented by both islands. A 15-mile light on the south-west corner of Shaikh Shuaib is therefore recommended. The lighting of Tanb is also recommended. Course is altered off this island winch cannot be always clearly seen at night. A light on Tanb will give a departure point to pass close to the north of Farur Island and clear of Farur Shoal, and serve as a clearing mark for the ilat shoal oft Kishm when making Lmgah. The site selected is on the summit of the island 165 feet above high water and near the north-west point. ’ A 20-mile light is proposed. 1 ifhrAA fj® 0111 , 47 is ailtici P a ted with regard to Tanb, which belongs to the Shaikh of Shargah. Persi y Government would have to be approached with reference to Shaikh Shuaib or Kais. Kais and Farur were also visited. Lingah. The establishment of a port light to facilitate the approach to Lingah is recommended. It should be situated at a height of 30 to 40 feet above the ground m order to be conspicuous by its elevation above the lower lights in the town, and could be placed in the courtyard or in front of the new offices of the British India Steam Navigation Company. Local arrangements for the efficient maintenance of this light can be made. Ras al Mutaf. A light at Ras al Mutaf is considered necessary. All traffic from Koweit Shaft al Arab, and Bushire, converges on, and rounds this point, and thi establishment of an 11-mile light vessel near the 10-fathom patch south west of the shoals is recommended. A shore light is clearly unsuitable owing to the extent of the shoal off the shore, s. 11 . BBushire. The erection of a 15-mile lighthouse on shore as proposed by the Admiralty Conference was considered. It is possible that the Persian Government may place obstacles in the way of the establishment of a light on shore. This difficulty can be avoided and the requirements of navigation better provided for by the establishment of an 11-mile light vessel moored in the outer anchorage, especially in hazy weather when, owing to the distance of the shore inside the 5-fathom line, the efficiency of a lighthouse on shore, both as a night and day mark, would be considerably reduced. A light vessel is therefore recommended. _ . . There is a beacon on Ras al Margh marking western limit of Lakia Sands which is a useful mark for the inner anchorage. There are no buoys. . t ^ The beacon and two buoys were established by the Belgian Customs officials at Bushire about four years ago. The buoys have disappeared, and the beacon is at present practically demolished. A gas buoy to mark the position of the inner anchorage off Ras al Marg is recommended, in which case the reconstruction of the beacon will be unnecessary, and both anchorages will be accessible at night. Shatt al Arab Bar. A light vessel with an 11-mile range, to mark the approach to the Bar is required. An approximate position four miles south-east of the outer buoy, as proposed by the Admiralty Conference, is concurred in. The total number of buoys at present maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company is seven, one of which, the “ Lawrence,” is m the old channel, now disused, and serves no useful purpose. It is considered that, in addition to the light vessel, the lighting of the Bar channel buoys is necessary. There is no great difficulty m navigating the river between Basra and Fao at night, and it is frequently done. It is not proposed to deal with the lighting or buoyage of the river above Fao in this report, but it may be a matter for future consideration m the event of development of trade at Mohammerah and Basra. The passage o the Bar at night offers considerable risk and difficulty. Ships which arrive at Fao or the outer buoy at night, and wish to avail themselves of a hig night tide, attempt the crossing of the Bar at night, and stranding is not infrequent. , British India mail steamers very often have to cross at night, bu generally make arrangements for the buoys to be lit temporarily by a boat sent out from Fao. , . , . , As for six months of the year the night tides are considerably higher than the day tides, the safe passage of the Bar by night may be an important matter for a large steamer, as a deeper draught is permissible t lan u ou the case if choice is restricted to a day tide. A night passage might also, in some cases, obviate the necessity for completing with cargo outside the Bar, and would at all times of the year be of great advantage to the mail steamers which have to keep time. -vr *-1) 7 It is recommended that immediately before the light vessel is established a careful re-survey of the Bar should be carried out by a surveying ship, and ie channel marked by a series of lighted buoys laid in accordance with the resul of the new survey. This may also affect the position of the light v esse . It is anticipated that four buoys will be required. The British India oteam Navigation Company’s mail steamers have ceased use of the Admiralty charts, and rely on a recent survey (1907) of the Bar made by one of their o cers, Mr. Burgess. Until a new and official survey has been made, it is no considered practicable to put forward proposals for rearranging and relaying the existing buoys. It is quite possible that a new survey may disclose the fact that the eastern channel is the better. This is indicated by the latest Admiralty survey. J The channel buoyed as proposed will require periodical examination to verity soundings, and it may be necessary to occasionally shift the buoys to suit variations m the channel. It is suggested that one of the officers of the vessel which will be required as a lighthouse tender should be a qualified surveyor. The Fao lights maintained by the Turkish Authorities are feeble and unreliable, but navigation would be rendered practically independent of them if a five-mile gas buoy were placed on the inner Bar. . Tlle llghtmg of tlle Shatt-al-Arab is regarded as the most important item m the whole lighting scheme for the Gulf. It is pointed out that certain of these buoys will fall, as do the present ones, within the territorial waters of Turkey or Persia. Hitherto this fact has been ignored in practice, and it is believed that the Local Authorities have never interested themselves or raised objections in connection with the British India Steam Navigation Company’s arrangements for buoying the Bar. J s It does not appear to be the province of this Committee to do more than draw attention to this aspect of the case. KoWElT. The Admiralty Conference proposed a 20-mile light on Kubbar Island, and a 10-mile light on Has al Arz. There can he no doubt that from a navigational point of view the approach to the port would thus be effectively lighted, but it must be pointed out that the height of the tower required for a 20-mile light on Kubbar would be approximately twice that necessary for a 15-mile light. I he height of the site on Kubbar Island is only 5 feet above high water. In view of the heavy cost involved in the erection of a tower for a 20-mile light, a light of only 15-mile range is recommended, in which case the range of the light proposed for Ras al Arz should be increased to 12 miles, which would involve little extra cost. Although the range of a 15-mile light will not extend to the island and shoals south-east of Failaka Island, a ship bound from the Shatt al Arab Bar to Koweit should have no difficulty in clearing those dangers, as a run of about 20 miles after losing sight of the Bar light will bring a 15-mile light on Kubbar within range. Even a 20-mile light on Kubbar Island would not effectively guard the Madura shoal. The suggestion with regard to Kubbar is only put forward provisionally m view of the incomplete survey of this locality. It is recommended that the8 neighbourhood be re-surveyed, the position and extent of the Madura shoal verified and the absence of other dangers placed beyond doubt. The result of this survey may conceivably indicate the necessity for modifications in the position and type of the outer light proposed for this port. , . . With, regard to the proposal to place an nnwatched light on the existing beacon at Ras al Arz, it is found that the beacon is not suitably constructed for supporting a light. _ n , A 12-mile light on a new structure adjacent to the site of the existing beacon is recommended. n r n i /\s it is necessary to maintain a watchman to guard the day mark at Has al Arz from depredation by Bedouin, it would be inadvisable to place an unwatched light at this point. ^ . . The Political Agent anticipates no danger of interference if local light keepers are employed. . Sheikh Mobarak of Koweit appears to be much interested m the proposal to light the port, and is unlikely to place any difficulty in the way. Good water is available within a mile of the Ras al Arz site, but arrangements for storage of water would be necessary on Kubbar. There are three buoys marking the anchorage, maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company. No additional buoyage is required as far as the anchorage is concerned. The Political Agent desired that the question of the channel into Shweikh should be gone into in view of possible future developments. It is considered that two small mark buoys will suffice, and that these should be preferably provided and maintained by local arrangement, as this Khor is only used as an anchorage lor the Political Agent s launch, the Sheikh’s steam yacht, and other small craft. The light, fixed red, visible five miles, recently established at the Agency by the Indian Government, meets all requirements as a harbour light. Bahrein. The Admiralty Conference propose the erection of— (1) a 20-mile light on Fasht ad Dibal, and (2) a 12-mile light on Muharrak. While the usefulness of the former is apparent, the proposed light on Muharrak is considered to be situated too far from the navigable channel to offer complete facilities for entering the port by night. It is possible that the establishment of a light on that island would not be altogether palatable to the Sheikh, but, in the Resident’s opinion, his objection could be overcome. In any case it is recommended that, instead of this lighthouse, a small light vessel, or gas boat, be established half a mi e outside the shoal near the present outer buoy, and that the existing Rasei a and West Spit buoys be replaced by lighted buoys, the Jadum buoy being retained in its present position. A 10-mile floating light at the entrance to the channel as above suggested would actually illuminate a more useful area than a 12-mile light on Muharrak, while it would indicate, without doubt, the entrance to the channel, which is necessary, if any scheme is to be effective. A making light for the port from the east and north is necessary, and a light having a range of about 20 miles on the north side of the reef at Faslit ad Dibal would be in the best position.e X po-ed°S ^ tha ‘ the C ° St ° f buildi ^ a suitable structure on an expooed site, such as the reef, may be considered prohibitive no other position offers equal advantages from a navigational point of view ’ east oniie ree ternatiV t iS t0 “h &amp; ™ SSel ab -t b miles north- tha of h T SU 3 P ° Sltl0n that the raD g e of visibility will overlap ensure th^t eth^ VeSS61 3t entrmCe t0 the channel &gt; to the north ° ne ° r ° ther b&lt;5 by a sbi P a PProaching from There are numerous dangers in the approaches to this port The tides unexpected sit T Str ° ng ’ UnCertain “ dire0ti ° n - A lar « e and totally that when tb! b bb Un ~ 0n and it is regarded as essential a wholp 16 ^ ^tb b ^ b ^ n ^ ° P hjahrem is undertaken it should be carried out as %ht anVbuo; J ^ ^ e3tabliShed 3t ^ — dme aS tbe “ bormJftm h 15 ^' 1 Sh ° al T S 7 i8ited 3nd eXamined ’ but a detailed survey and borings will be necessary before any work is undertaken on the reef.

The port lights proposed for Lingah and Debai bein/;, . are recommended for early establishment in any case e ^ ensive cBuoys and Beacons. 8. The following is a correct list of the buoys and beacons now in the Persian Gulf: Bunder Abbas Bahrein Bu shire Koweit - Shatt al Arab Bar - Buoys 1 4 Beacons. 1 1 1 Total All the above, with the exception of the beacons at Bushire and Koweit, are the property of, and are maintained by, the British India Steam Isav^gation Compa ^ at Bush i re , was erected about four years ago bv the Belgian Customs officials, and is the property of their department. Two buoys were laid at the same time, but they have disappearec. The spar buoys shown on plan of Bushire anchorage no longer exist. The beacon is in a bad state of repair. Koweit beacon was erected, and is maintained, on Ras al Arz by the ^^TL^rffinteacon is liable to be washed away, and needs reconstructing. The Lawrence buoy on Shatt al Arab Bar marks the old channel which is now silted up, and serves no useful purpose. . The spar buoys shown on the chart of Shatt al Arab Bar east of inner Bar channel no longer exist. Proposals for improving Buoyage : Jask —A small unlit buoy on the tail of the shoal extending two miles ' north-west of Jask Point would be of great convenience to ships entering the anchorage. Bunder Abbas.-A buoy with a distinctive top-mark in lieu of the existing anchorage buoy is recommended. If a lighthouse is erected at Kishm a lighted buoy in addition to that marking t le anc orage will be required outside the shoals off Kishm Point. Bushire —A gas buoy to mark the inner anchorage is proposed. It should be moored off Ras al Marg and will render the re-construction of the beacon unnecessary and enable ships to enter the inner anchorage at night. Shatt al Arab Bar.-Four gas buoys to replace the fisting buoys have been provisionally recommended m the proposals for g g Bar. A re-survey of the Bar will be required before they are laid. Koweit .—The present system of buoying the anchorage is ^tisfactorjo The retention of the beacon will be unnecessary when the Ras al Ar light is erected. Bahrein -In dealing with the scheme for lighting Bahrein it has been proposed that a gas boat should replace the present outer buoy and that gas buoys should be moored off Ras Ivaseifa and e The existing buoy off Jadum should be retained. The beacon neec , reconstructing.The foregoing proposals, if adopted, will involve the removal of the whole of the existing buoys on the Shatt al Arab Bar, the buoy at Bunder Abbas and three buoys at Bahrein. Ihe only remaining buoys of the present system will be three at Koweit and one at Bahrein. In the opinion of the Committee the British India Steam Navigation ompany assess the value of their buoys at a figure which is not justified by their apparent condition. Nothing is known as to the condition of the moorings. A copy of correspondence with the Company on this subject is attached. In Preference to taking over any buoys from the British India Steam Navigation Company it is suggested that a more satisfactory course will be to .lay new buoys on the uniform system in those positions where it is pioposed in this report that buoys should be retained or established. 9.

The question of fog signals has been considered, but though hazy weather is not uncommon, fog is of rare occurrence and short duration in the Gulf, and fog signals are not considered necessary. Lightkeepers. 11 From inquiries made it is considered that the Gulf Arab could be trained into a reasonably good lightkeeper, and there are obvious advantages in the employment of local men, but in the case of the light vessels the lightsmen might with advantage be recruited from India. In any case the crews of light vessels and lighthouses in isolated positions should be armed. Lighthouse Tender. 12. The whole of the Persian Gulf would form a large lighthouse district in itself, and it would be imperative that a specially constructed steamer, to act as the lighthouse tender, be built and kept in Commission solely for this duty which would occupy the whole of her time. A distilling plant and storage for the supply of drinking water to isolated lighthouses and hg vessels should he special features of her equipment. The construction of this vessel should be undertaken before, or concurrently with, the establishment of the earlier lights. f Water. 13 One of the principal difficulties in connection with the maintenance of lighthouses and vessels in the Persian Gulf is obtaining and supplying them with fresh water. The only place in the Gulf where drinking wa er in any quantity can be procured conveniently is the Shatt al Arab iver above Fao. n . „ , , • This would necessitate the lighthouse tender making mpien P the river and the provision of a large storage capacity which space could be more usefully devoted to other purposes. In view of these considerations a distilling plant on board the tender has been recommended. Repairs, &amp;c. 14 . With the exception of Basra the Gulf offers practically no facilities for repair or constructional work.• ■ f or ^ s a ‘ Ij y ncl1 ati Basra were, however, visited, and the opinion formed that that firm would be capable of executing most general ropciirs. Depot. ’o. Hie establishment of a Depot at Basra offers advantages, but there are po itical objections to that course, and the distance up the river is a considerable inconvenience. Other places were considered and examined in this connection, notably howeit, which is the only port in the Gulf where a vessel of even moderate draught can approach near the shore. Land could be obtained there on the mainland opposite Jezirat Knrein.

The scheme proposed concentrates practically all the gas buoys at one end of the Gulf, which is an important consideration in view of their maintenance by the lighthouse tender. Maintenance. 17. From the point of view of practical convenience and expedience, apart rom any question of the incidence of cost, it appears to the Committee that the Government of India are clearly in the best position to undertake the arrangements necessary for the up-keep of the lights and buoys decided upon and for the administration of the lighting system generally, assuming that no international complications arise to interfere with such a course.

It was, of course no c isadvantage to us that other steamers should use the buoys, and we had never thought of asking them to contribute. I cannot help fancyino-, as I mentioned to you at our meeting the other day, that there is a political move e md this proposal of the Hamburg-American Company, the object being to give Germany a vested interest in the Persian Gulf. It has occurred to me that it might be a good thing politically for us to make over the ownership of these buoys to His .Majesty’s Government. I may say at once that I do not make tbe suggestion in order that the British ndia Company may benefit pecuniarily, either in the way of being repaid the cost of buoys or in escaping from the charge for their maintenance In fact, to avoid any idea of this sort, we should be quite prepared to hand the uoys over to the Government for a nominal consideration, and we would still maintain them free of cost in return for their use.

From a navigational point of view Fisher*s Bock offers an ideal site, but the cost of/safe structure, even for a small light, in such am exposed position would be very heavy. The alternative site on has Muscat is therefore recommended.

A 15 mile light on the soutn-west corner of Sfc&amp;SkA Shuaib is therefore recommended. The lighting of Tanb is also recommended, Course is altered off this island which cannot be always clearly seen at night. A light on Tanb will give a depar ure point to pass close to the north of Farur Island and clear of Farur shoal, and serrv as a clearing mark for the Flat Shoal off Eishm when making Lingah. The site selected is on the summit of the island 165 feet above H.W. rnd near the north-west point. A' : ’$0 ’ li 1 e 1 i pht (v ropo s ed.H No political difficulty is anticipated with regard to Tanb which belongs to the Shaikh of Shargah. The Persian (Government would have to be approach ed with reference no Shaikh Shuaib or Kais. Kais and Farur were ,lso visited* LINGAH. The establishment of a port light to facilitate the approach to Lingaii is reco-m.ended. It should be situated at a height of oG to 40 feet above the ground in order to be conspicuous by its elevation above the lower lights in the town end could be placed in the courtyard, or in front, of the new offices of the British India S.P'.Oo. Local arrar?n’clients for the ef ficient maintenance of this light can. be made. MS AL MUTAF, A light at Ras ul JIutaf is considered necessary. All traffic from Xoweit, Shatt al Arab and Rusnire converges on, and rounds, this point and the establish ment of an 11 mile light vessel near the 10 fatiibm natch south west of the snoals is recommended. A shore light is clearly unsuitable owing to the extent of the shoal off the shore. BUBHIRB. The erection of a 15 rile light-house on shore as proposed by the Admiralty Conference was considered. x It is possible that the Persian government may place obstacles in the way of the establishment of a li &gt;re. This difficulty can b,e avoided and the requirements of navigation better provided for by the establishment of an 11 mile L.V. moored in the outer / A anchoragedistance of the shore inside the 5 fathom line the efficiency of a liyht-house on shore, both as a night and clay mark, would be considerably reduced• A light vessel is therefore recomiaended. dhere is a beacon on Eas al Margh marking western limit of Lakfa Bands which is a useful mark for the inner anchorage * (There are no buoys. The beacon and two buoys were established by the Belgian Customs Officials at Bushire about 4 years ago. The buoys have disappeared and the beacon is at x&gt;resent* practically demolished. A gas buoy to mark the position of the inner an chorage off Eas al Harg is recommended, in whi&amp;h case the reconstruction of the be anon will be unnecessary and both anchorages will be accessibly at night* A SiylTT AL Ab^3 BAB. A light vessel with an 11 mile range, to mark the a»ek©9?^»e approach to the Bar is required. An approximate position 4 voiles south east of the outer bu# as pronosed by the Admiralty Conference is concurred in. The total number of buoys at present maintained — _ .# by tlie B.I.S.J.Co., is 7, one of which, the 'Lawrence' is in the old channel, now disused, and serves no use ful ourpose. It is considered that, in addition to the litnt vessel, the lighting of the Bar channel buoys is ne cessary. There is no rrreat difficulty in navigating the river between Basra and Fao at night find it is frequently done. It is not proposed to deal vith the lighting ot buoyage of the river above Pao in -iw is &gt;ort but it nay toe a matter for future consideration in the event of development of trade at J.fohauimerah and Basra. The passage of the Bar at night offers consi derable( 11 ) considerable risk and difficulty. Ships which arrive at J-ao or the outer buoy at night and wish to avail themselves of a high night tide, attempt the cross ing of the Bar at night, and stranding is not infffe- quent. -rtritisn India fell Steamers very often have to cross at night but generally make arrangements for the buoys to be lit temporarily by a boat sent out from Fao* As for six months of the year the night tides are considerably higher thai|the day tides the safe passage o* the Bar by night my be an. important matter for a large steamer, as a deeper draught is permissablt Id be the case if ohoi*e is restricted to a day tide. A night passage might also, in some cases, obvi ate the necessity for completing with cargo outside the Bar and would at all tines of the year be of great advantage to t ail steamers which have to keep time. It is recommended that immediately before the li'*.t vessel is established a careful re-survey of the Bar should be carried out by a surveying ship and the channel marked by a series of lighted buoys laid in accordance with the resuit of the new survey. This w.iy also afxect the position of the light vessel. It is anticipated that 4 buoys will be required. The B.I.b.p.Jo's mail steamers have ceased use of the .ad miralty Charts and rely on a recent survey (1907) of tiie Bar made by one of their officers. Hr Burgess. Until a new and official survey has been made it is not oonsi ered practicable to put forward proposals for re-arranging and re-laying the existing buoys. It is quite possible that a new survey may dis close tne fact that the Eastern channel is the better, .Ohs is indicated by the latest Admiralty survey.( 1 £) The on nnel buoyed as proposed will require perio ioal examination to verify soundings and it may 'be ne cessary to occasionally shift the buoys to suit varia tions in the channel. It is suggested that one of the officers of the vessel which will be required as a light—house tender should be a qualified surveyor* The fs® lights maintained by the Iqkish Authori ties are feeble and unreliable but navigation would be rendered practically independent of them if a 5 mile gas buoy wbre placed on the inner Bar. The lighting of the Shatt al Arab is regarded as the most important item in the whole lighting system scheme for the Gulf. It is pointed but that certain of ee buoys will fall, as do the present ones, within tht territorial waters of Turkey or Persia. Hitxierto this fact has been, ignored in practice and it is believed that the local authorities have never interested 'themselves or raised objections in connection with the B.I.S.II.Oo 1 s arrangements for buoying the Bar. It does not appear to be the province of this Committee to do more than draw attention to this as pect of the case. X01EIT. The Admiralty Conference proposedaA 20 mile light on Kwbb&amp;r Island and a 10 mile light on has al Ara. There can be no doubt that from a navigational point s , ... ; \ of view the approach to the port would bnus be effect ively lighted but it must be pointed out -that the height of ‘biie tower required for a 20 mile light on Kubbar would be approximately twice that necessary for a 15 mile light. The height of the site on Kubbar Island is only 5 feet above HightWater. In view of the /heavy cost f - , : „ involved in the erection of a tower for a BO mile a ' ; -- . / lightlinrht a li^ht of only 15 mile range i£ recoi?iended in which case the rang® of flight proposed for Bm al Arz should be increased to IS miles wnich would in volve little extra cost. Although the m . [iS light id, 11 not extend to the island and shoals south east of Failaka Island a ship bound from the Shatt al Arab Bar to howe-it should have no difficulty in clear ing those dangers as a run of losing sight of the Bar light light on hub oar within range, on Kubbar Island would not ef; about 20 miles after will bring a 15 mile Bven a 20 mile light rbively guard the Madura shoal. f ST^Pteatlon with regard to Kulfcar is only put foward provisionally in view of the incomplete survey of this locality. It is recommended that the neigh bourhood be re-surveyed, the position and extent of the Madura shoal verified and the absence of other dangers placed beyond doubt. The result of this sur- rft vey may conoievably indicate(necessity for modifica tions in the position and type of the outer light pro posed for this port. ^itii regard to the proposal to place an unwatched light on the existin' beacon at has al Arz it is .ound that the Deacon is not suitably constructed for sup porting a light. A 12 mile light on a new structure adjacent to the site of the existing beacon is recommended. As it is necessary to maintain a watchman to vuar# the day mark at Has al Ars from depredation by Bedouin it would be inadvisable bo place an. unwatcried light at this point. ’The political Agent antici$|ites no danger of in terference if local light keepers are employed* Sneikh Mobarak of 'v.oweit appears to be much in terested in the proposal to light the port and is un likely to place any difficulty in the way. GoodI ^ (14) Good '-rater is available v/itiiin a mile of tile kas al Atz site but arrantements for storage of water would be necessary on Kubbar. ^here are three buoys, marking fix. an olio rage, maintained by the Ho additional buoyage is required as far as the anahorage is concerned. ^he Political Agent desired that the question of the channel Into Bhweikh should be uone into in. view of possible future developments. It is considered that two small mark buoys will suffice and that these should be preferably provided and maintained by local arrangement as this Khor is only used as an anchorage for the Political Agent’s launch, ;; 3 steam yacht and other email craft * The light. Fixed red, visible 6 miles, recently. established at the Agency by the Indian, Govern exit meets all requirements as a harbour light. BAHHF'TH • The Admiralty Conference Dropose the erection of (1) A 20 mile light on Fasht ad bibal y and (S) A 12 -He light on l-hhaarrak. Phile the usefulness of the former is apparent, the proposed light on Muharrak is considered ”to be situated too far fvo^ the navigable channel to offer complete facilities for entering tlie port by night. It is possible that the establishment of a light on th-'t island ’ •orld not be altoger^/.er palatable to the &gt;heikh but in the resident’ s opinion his objection could be overcome. In any case it is reoo: imsnded that insteadtills lip'ht-house, a small li-mt vessel, or gas boat, be established | b mile outside the ihoal near -tbe present outer buoy and tlmt the existing Ka~ mt buoys be re l&amp;Oftd by lighted buoys, the Jadur buoy being retained in its present position* A 10 mile floating light at the entrance to the /6' Channel(16) channel eb h-oovq /would act#'ua.lly 11 luiiiinsi't© a -ioT , e useful area t»iian a 12 mile light* on Muharrak, while it would indicate, without doubt, the entrance north is necessary and a li ht having a range of about 20 miles on the north side of the reef at Fasirb Ed Dioal would be in the best position. Although it is feared that the cost of building a suitable structure on an. exposed site, such as the reef, m y be considered prohibitive, no other position offers equal advantages from a navigational noint of view. H'he only alternative is to establish a liwht vessel about 5 miles north-e^t of the reef in such a position that the ran-e of visibility will overlap that ot the : ?as boat or smaller vessel at the entrance to :*he channel, to ensure that either one or the other wd. 1.1 oe seen by a ship approaching from the north. ri htre are numerous dangers in the approaches to this port. f? ’he tides in the locality are strong, and uncertain in ' lirection. A large and totally unexpect— ed set is no unoomraon experience and it is regarded as essential tha,t when tne lighting of Bahrein is un.cler— taken it should be carried out as a whole i.e. the maxin^ lipht be established at the same tiiAe as the channel light and buoys. Fasht bA Dibal shoal was visited and exa lined, but a detailed survey and borings will be necessary before any worh is undertaken on the reef. There has recently been a considerable increase to still xurther develope. hail and other steamers DBBAI call(Id) call there regularly and it is recommended that a port lisht similar to that already proposed for Lingan be established on the sea front# Local arrangements for efficient maintenance of this limbt can be made. OEDEH OF D-iPORTANOR. Xt is considered that the lights proposed should be arranged in th- following order of importance (1) • Snatt al Arab . : 3ar, L, V. and 4 buoys (2) .

Debai (lb). Bunder Abbas. T’he l irst se^en lights being those most urgently required are su-nested as a convenient first instal- mant of the general scheme. The position assigned to Hubbar Island or its alternative in the above list has been determined unon be M '.'.'rit -mpear •p/the claims of Phe port fro tne navigational point of view under oxisting conditions. Should there be grounds for taking specific account o,. tb.i probability of Koweit increasing quickly in importance in connection with the building of the Barb. dad Railway, its relative position in the list would be materially advanced. rn he port lights proposed for Linaah and Lebai(17) being inexpensive items are recommended for early establishment in any case.

Koweit The present system of buoying the anchorage is sati s facto ry. The retention of the beacon will be unnecessary when the Has al Arz light is erected. Bahrein In dealing with the scheme for lighting Bahrein it has been proposed that a gas b oat should replace the present outer buoy end that gas buoys should be moored off has Kaseifa and the West Spit. The exist ing buoy off Jadum should be retained. The beacon nee needs reconstructing. The foregjinp proposals, if adopted, will involve the re moval of the whole of the existing buoys on the Shatt al Arab Bar, the buoy at .'Sunder Abbas and b buoys at Bahrein.

The aonstruotion of this vessel should be under taken before, or concurrently with, the establishment of the earlier lights.

Present: Rear-Adm tr al A. M. Field, F.R.S., Hydrographer, Admiralty. Captain E. J. W. Sla.de, M.V.O., Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiralty. Mr. J. E. Ferard, Assistant Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. 1. The questions to be discussed at the Conference were as follows :— (а) Which, if any, of the present lights and buoys are to be taken over from the British India Company who now maintain them ? (б) How far is the present system to be extended ? (c) Who is to equip and maintain the system of the lights and buoys decided upon ? (d) How is the cost to be apportioned ? It is proposed to set out our recommendations on each of these points in order. 2. (a) Existing Lights and Buoys—It is understood from the information supplied to us that there are 1G buoys and one white stone beacon maintained in the Persian Gulf by the British India Company, viz. :— Buoys. Beacons. At Koweit _ - 3 x In the Shat-el-Arab - - 8 — At Bandar Abbas - - 1 At Bahrein - - 4 1 Total - - 16 1 We recommend that all the buoys maintained by the Company together with the beacon should be taken over by the British Government. There are also two buoys and a beacon at Bushire, as to the ownership and maintenance of which no information has so far been forthcoming. On the assumption that the necessary arrangements can be made, we recommend that these also should be taken over. 3. (h) Extension of the Present System .—It will be convenient for the moment to set aside consideration of the question of cost or of diplomatic difficulties, and to consider solely from the navigational point of view what would be the most effective scheme for the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. Such a scheme appears to necessitate the adoption of the following proposals :— Maskat. The provision of an unwatched light with low tower. s. 11 .Entrance to the Gulf. The choice lies between a light on the Persian Coast near Tarn, or one on an island off the Musandim Peninsula. The former is preferable from a navigational point of view, but the danger of interference with the light would necessitate the provision of a guard. It is considered, therefore, impracticable to place the light on the Persian Coast. Of the islands off the Musandim Peninsula the best appears to be that of Little Quoin, provided that the site is practicable ; this will have to be investigated. Failing the Little Quoin, Kachalu islet, on the eastern entrance of Musandim Island, might possibly be suitable. Bandar Abbas. ^ A 15-mile light on Kishm is necessary. This might be unwatched. One buoy is maintained by the British India Company, and this appears to be sufficient. Linga. An unwatched light is recommended to replace the present temporary light. Bahrein. (i) At Fasht-ad-Dibal a 20-mile light is considered essential on the reef, (ii) At Muharrach a 12-mile light (unwatched) is considered necessary. There are at present four buoys and one white stone beacon m Bahrein Harbour maintained by the British India Company. These are considered sufficient for the present. Bushire. An unwatched light is required on the cliff at Bushire, sufficiently elevated to show on a south bearing over the tops of trees on the low land to the southward. This should be a 15-mile light. There are already two buoys and a beacon which are considered sufficient for all practical purposes. Koweit Barbour. (i.) On Jezirat Kubbar a 20-mile light is required. (ii.) At Eas-al-Arz an unwatched 10-mile light is required on the present beacon. Three buoys are at present maintained at Koweit by the British India Company. No others are required at present. Bhat-el-Arab. A light vessel is required to be placed about 4 miles to the south-east of the outer buoy. Eight buoys are maintained in the river by the British India Company, and these are considered sufficient. 4. It has been explained above (paragraph 3) that in framing the foregoing scheme consideration of the question of cost or of diplomatic difficulties has been set aside.As regards the cost of the scheme it is not possible to form a reliable estimate owing to the fact that the amount of both the initial and recurring charges depends largely on the local circumstances and can only be estimated on the spot. It should be explained, however, that the establish- ment of lights involves the provision of a small vessel fitted as a lighthouse tender, besides the necessary plant for the manufacture of the gas lor supplying the unwatched lights. As regards diplomatic difficulties, we note that our proposals will presumably involve arrangement with the Persian authorities, the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, or any others who may be interested. J It seems desirable, therefore, to arrange in order of their importance the ights required for the navigation of the Persian Gulf. This order is considered to be as follows :— (1.) Musandim. (2.) Maskat. (3.) Bushire. (4.) Shat-el-Arab (a light vessel). (5.) Muharrack (Bahrein). (6.) Fasht-ad-Dibal (Bahrein). (7.) Jezirat Kubbar (Koweit). (8.) Bandar Abbas, l-t • . (9.) Ras-al-Arz (Koweit). (10.) Linga. 5. (c) Maintenance of Lights and Buoys.—h is suggested that the Government of India should be invited to arrange for the maintenance of the buoys and lighthouses in the Persian Gulf by the Royal Indian Marine, or in whatever manner they should think lit. . 6 - ® Apportionment of Cost.—It is suggested that the cost should be divided equally between British and Indian revenues, this being the principle usually followed 'with regard to Persian expenditure. As to the amount, it has been already explained (paragraph 4) that no reliable estimate can be at present furnished. A. Mostyn Field. Edmond J. W. Slade, D.N.I. J. E.

Hood, their Civil Constructive Assistant Engineer, who is an Associate Member ol the Institute of Civil Engineers, and has been for many years in the Trinity House Service, and who is, in the opinion of the Elder Brethren,fully competent to carry out the work required of him in connection with the proposed local enquiry on the subject. Mr. Hood has expressed his willingness to undertake this duty on the terms stated in the second paragraph of your letter under reply, and he will be ready to proceed at The Under Secretary of State, once India Office,once on -being informed of the date on which t is des red he should start, and of the place at wh ch he is to joLn the other Off cers taking part in the enquiry, &amp;c. I am to add that the Corporation note the concluding, paragraph of your letter under reply, in regard to which I am to state that Mr. Hood has had the advantage of dis cuss jng the question of the proposed Lighting and Buoyage with those of the Elder Brethren who are personally acquainted with the Persian Gulf; and to request that you will assure Viscount Morley that the Corporation will, if his Lordship so desires, he very ready to consider, and furnsh their views on the report of the Commission of Enquiry, or to further assist the India Office in any way that may he desired, should it he ultimately decided to prepare a definite scheme for the better Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf. It is assumed hy the Trinity House that the Officer-in- Charge of the Marine Survey of India will provide any necessary instruments, &amp;c. which may he required in ponnectioh with the investigations. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your obedient Servant,No. 189 or 1908. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. POREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. General. To ^ k l7±tZ (&lt;« 7s kb'i The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MO RLE V op BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India * Simla, the 5 th November 1908. My Lord, We hare the honour to forward herewith a copy of the correspondence on the subject of a proposal to construct a lighthouse at Ras-ul-Arz near Koweit in the Persian Gulf, together with a site plan and diagram of the masonry tower as proposed by the Government of Bombay, and to request that the papers may be laid before the Elder Brethren at Trinity House with a view to obtaining their advice. 2 . Prom paragraph 3 of the letter No. 18 M„ dated 2nd January 1908, to the address of the Bombay Government, it will be observed that we hive considered the alternative of constructing a steel tower in place of the masonry structure ; and we would add that, while the former would be preferable for the reasons there stated, namely, that the design could be furnished complete and ready for erection, it would probably be cheaper to construct either a composite masonry and steel structure or one entirely of masonry. A lighthouse of masonry without reinforcement has been estimated to cost Rs. 6,500, and we would ask that we may be furnished with separate approximate Estimates of the cost, delivered at Koweit of— («) the cheapest steel structure to suit the site and the circumstances explained above, and ( 6 ) the lantern complete. 3 As the erection of the lighthouse will require expert supervision which the Government of Bombay are unable to provide, we have considered the advisability of obtaining an expert from England for the purpose. It is %■%1 feared, however, that this may prove very costly for such a small structure, and we desire, in the first instance, to be informed of the probable extra cost which such expert supervision will entail. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants. . / r *ire, r •&gt; L I list of enclosures in Secret despatch No. 189 (General), dated the 5 th November 1908, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

I am not in a position to say whether provision has been made in the flagstaff estimate for a lightning conductor. 'With the recollection fresh in my mind of the unfortunate accident to the Russian Consulate-General at Bushire, this provision would seem essential. Possibly the point could be cleared up by a telegraphic enquiry from the Director, Royal Indian Marine. 7. The question of recurring expenditure has already been gone into in my letter No. 65, dated the 31st January 1907, and I see no reason for altering the estimates then submitted. No. 240, dated Koweit, the 21nt May 1907. From—M ajor S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Boshire. I have the honour to submit, herewith, in reply to your office endorsement No. 2418, dated the 14th October 1900, an estimate for the probable cost of lighting the Ras-el-Arz. 2 . I regret that, in spite of diligent enquiries on an unfamiliar subject, the estimates I am able to furnish, are still imperfect and would strongly recom mend that they should be submitted to expert opinion. 3. Statement A, which accompanies this letter, shows the amount of initial expenditure involved ; but in carrying out the work, there are bound to be material alterations for the reasons which I now proceed to give. I trust, however, that, on the whole, it will be found possible to erect the building with out exceeding the estimates. 4. Item 1 has been carefully calculated by me in the light of the assistance afforded me by letter P. T. No. 65—4815, dated the 15th February 1907, from Messrs. Richardson and Cruddas, Bombay, to my address, a copy of which is forwarded for perusal. There is, however, one material alteration in the design since that letter was written. By removing the light-house inland from the present site of the beacon to about 200 paces west, we gain an elevation of 12 feet which will materially reduce expense. Thus from actual ground level on the new site, the summit of the masonry will only need to be 35 feet as against 46 calculated formerly, and shown in the sketch accompanying Messrs. Richardson and Cruddas’ letter. 5. The stonework calculations are attached to the abstract estimates, and it is necessary to note that there has been no expert examination of the founda tion. I trust, however, that a stone circular platform diameter 16 feet and depth below ground level of 8 feet, will be ample for a structure practically only 35 feet high. 6 . Item No. 2. Labour, water and mortar has been contracted for by a local mason, but on the assumption that the tower will be 46 feet high, not 35 feet high. There should be some reduction here; but I have allowed the ori ginal estimate to stand, as I anticipate that item No. 7 will prove more costly than estimated for. 7. Item No. 3 will also, it is to he hoped, show some reduction in expendi ture in consequence of the reduction in the length of the iron spiral staircase from 38 feet to 27 feet. I have allowed the original estimate to stand, as the alteration is a trifling one and, as already stated, more money will be required for item No. 7. 8 . For items Nos. 4, 5 and 6 please refer to Messrs. Richardson and Cruddas’ letter. There has been no alteration in these three items. This firm has been most obliging in assisting me with advice, and I have found work3 done by them to be both ?ood and reliable, so that I hope, if mv pronosals be ,t»” .it, 1 aar -* “'™ i ^ !*» - ” 1 *» contained in the correspondence that formei/tbe e V 1 ' ^ aiI ' e &gt; bomtiiy, and dated the 19th May 1907.

Care would have to be exercised in their selection, as there are as many slack and careless men among them as there are smart and careful. Two at least of my Nejdi camelmen, though at some inconvenience, I could confidently promote to these posts and they could, I think, manage the light between them, so that an Arab scheme, so worked, 17.

From— Messrs Richardson and Cruddas, Bombay, To—The Political Agent, Koweit. We are in receipt of your letters Nos. 48, 55 and 57 of the 23rd, 28th and 30th ultimo respectively, referring to a lantern top and spiral staircase for a light-house. First as regards your query re the masonry shaft and foundations, we have looked into the matter, taking the following figures as our data :— Wind pressure = 60 lbs. per ft. super; Weight of masonry = 112 lbs. per ft. cube, and we find that, to confirm to the usually established rule of so proportioning the walls, and consequently the dead weight, so as to cause the line of the resultant between the wind and the dead load (in a circular tower) to fall with in the middle 3 rd of the base, the bearing area of the shaft will have to be con siderably enlarged as compared with that proposed by your master mason. We enclose a diagramatic sketch of the lighthouse, shewing the enlarged base and also, in red, the line of pressure above referred to, and from this you will see the necessity of the modification which we propose. As regards depth and area of foundations, we fear that without knowledge of the site on which the structure is to he erected, it is not possible for us to offer any opinion further than to point out that the concrete base must of course he of sufficient size to extend somewhat beyond the lowest courses of stonework, and also, if in such a position that the sea may wash same, the concrete should he either built up to a height sufficient to keep the lowest courses of masonry dry except in stormy weather, or else old rails or other holdfasts should be embedded in the concrete and masonry so as to strongly and intrically connect the base and superstructure and form same into one whole. We may point out that the bearing area of the concrete base is governed not so much by the need of providing a sufficient number of square feet to spread the weight of the superstructure, but more by the need of obtaining the necessary resistance to overturning through wind pressure. As regards the spiral staircase, we note that you specify a staircase 46' 0' high, and though we have no specific details of lanterns such as you describe, we are of opinion that to permit of a person ascending to, and descending from, a lantern house of such restricted dimensions without difficulty it will be well to stop the spiral staircase off say 38' 0' from the bottom of tower and there provide a landing and a vertical step ladder, supported against the masonry wall, to complete the remaining 8 ' O' of height, this will allow of a person pass ing the lantern framing and gearing without difficulty and also will permit a covered in chequer plate floor over the whole area of the lantern house with a moveable trap door at head of step ladder. For the spiral staircase, 38' 0' high and step ladder 8 ' 0' high with land ing and all attachments our price f. o. b. Bombay would be Rs. 630.

No. 401, dated Koweit, the 29th July 1907. From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to my letter No. 240, dated the 21st May 1907, on the subject of the estimates of the Ras-ul-Arz light-house. 2. The Assistant Engineer is now engaged, at my request, in checking the estimates therewith submitted, and it would appear that the foundation (the site for which is to be examined closely) will prove far more costly than I anticipated. 3 . He has promised me amended estimates of the construction and a report on the site. 4 . Sheikh Mubarak paid me a visit on the 26th instant, and I mentioned that I proposed that the Assistant Engineer should inspect the site for the proposed light-house of which I have made no secret. The Sheikh showed some curiosity as to the site which I thought implied suspicions of our intention. I at once asked him whether he had any objections to urge against the proposal, and he replied that he would like to inspect the site with me later on wdien the project was riper. The opportunity was not a favourable one for a lengthened discussion, as the Assistant Engineer w T as present and had just been introduced to the Sheikh, but as it appeared to me that the Sheikh s attitude was likely to lead to difficulties in the future, I resolved to take it up again as soon as possible. 5 . I returned the Sheikh’s visit on the 28th instant, and asked him what his wishes were. The Sheikh replied that he had no wish to raise difficulties in the matter of the site, but he was anxious that his right to the land should be clearly recognized, and provided he received a pepper-corn rent to indicate his ownership, he would be satisfied. 6 . I replied that I quite realized the Sheikh’s wishes and thought that, provided the construction of the light-house was sanctioned, no objection would be made to the payment of such a rent. I proposed 1 rupee per month subject to the sanction of Government. The Sheikh agreed. 7. It is, therefore, necessary before any definite steps are taken to carry on the light-house project that this matter should be down in writing. Two conditions occur to me—( 1 ) enjoyment of the site as along as we please subject to payment of the monthly rent of rupee one, ( 2 ) should the site for any reason be abandoned, our right to remove the materials should be recognized, subject to the payment of rent as long as any materials we desire to remove, remain in situ. I would, therefore, request that, if the light-house project be sanctioned, I may be instructed whether I may be permitted, as a preliminary, to bind Government to a lease of the nature indicated above. 9 , I would, in conclusion, point out that the discussion is interesting as showing the views that Sheikh Mubarak holds as to his rights in land and his increasing disinclination to gift or sell land on apy consideration whatever.1 10 As per Messrs.

Building stone (coral rock) can be obtained from the shore at the north of the site. The Consul has already had 537 cubic feet of stone excavated and piled ready for use. There is no sweet water within from 5—7 miles, and any necessity for its use in construction will involve considerable expense (e. g., using Gutch “ Impure plaster of Paris,the local substitute for lime and “ Sarooch,” locally made cement, can be used for the mortar; this will not require sweet water).1908 SIMLA.

Field, F.R.S., Hyclrographer, Rear-Admiral Admiralty. Captain E. J. W. Sla.de, M.V.O., Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiralty. Mr. J. E. Ferard, Assistant Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. 1. The questions to be discussed at the Conference were as follows :— (а) Which, if any, of the present lights and buoys are to be taken over from the British India Company who now maintain them ? (б) How far is the present system to be extended ? (c) Who is to equip and maintain the system of the lights and buoys decided upon ? (d) How is the cost to be apportioned ? It is proposed to set out our recommendations on each of these points in order. 2. (a) Existing Lights and Buoys. —It is understood from the information supplied to us that there are 16 buoys and one white stone beacon maintained in the Persian Gulf by the British India Company, viz.:— Buoys. Beacons. At Koweit In the Shat-el-Arab At Bandar Abbas At Bahrein Total We recommend that all the buoys maintained by the Company together with the beacon should be taken over by the British Government. There are also two buoys and a beacon at Bushire, as to the ownership and maintenance of which no information has so far been forthcoming. On the assumption that the necessary arrangements can be made, we recommend that these also should be taken over. 3. (h) Extension of the Present System .—It will be convenient for the moment to set aside consideration of the question of cost or of diplomatic difficulties, and to consider solely from the navigational point of view what would be the most effective scheme for the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. Such a scheme appears to necessitate the adoption of the following proposals :— Maskat. The provision of an unwatched light with low tower, s. 11 .Entrance to the Gulf. The choice lies between a light on the Persian Coast near Tarn, or one on an island off the Musandim Peninsula. The former is preferable from a navigational point of view, but the danger of interference with the light would necessitate the provision of a guard. It is considered, therefore, impracticable to place the light on the Persian Coast. Of the islands off the Musandim Peninsula the best appears to be that ot Little Quoin, provided that the site .is practicable ; this will have to be investigated. Failing the Little Quoin, Kachalu islet, on the eastern entrance of Musandim Island, might possibly be suitable. Bandar Abbas. A 15-mile light on Kishm is necessary. This might he unwatched. One buoy is maintained by the British India Company, and this appears to he sufficient. Linga . An unwatched light is recommended to replace the present temporary light. Bahrein. (i) At Fasht-ad-Dibal a 20-mile light is considered essential on the reef. (ii) At Muharrach a 12-mile light (unwatched) is considered necessary. ^ There are at present four buoys and one white stone beacon in Bahrein Harbour maintained by the British India Company. These are considered sufficient for the present. Bushire. An unwatched light is required on the cliff at Bushire, sufficiently elevated to show on a south bearing over the tops of trees on the low land to the southward. This should be a 15-mile light. There are already two buoys and a beacon which are considered sufficient for all practical purposes. Koweit Harbour. (i.) On Jezirat Kubbar a 20-mile light is required. (ii.) At Eas-al-Arz an unwatched 10-mile light is required on the present beacon. Three buoys are at present maintained at Koweit by the British India Company. No others are required at present. Ehat-el-Arab. A light vessel is required to be placed about 4 miles to the south-east of the outer buoy. Eight buoys are maintained in the river by the British India Company, and these are considered sufficient. 4. It has been explained above (paragraph 3) that in framing the foregoing scheme consideration of the question of cost or of diplomatic difficulties has been set aside.3 v.ita Ab regards the cost of the scheme it is not possible to form a reliable estimate owing to the fact that the amount of both the initial and recurring charges depends largely on the local circumstances and can only be estimated on the spot. It should be explained, however, that the establish ment of lights involves the provision of a small vessel fitted as a lighthouse tender, besides the necessary plant for the manufacture of the gas for supplying the unwatched lights. As regards diplomatic difficulties, we note that our proposals will presumably involve arrangement with the Persian authorities, the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, or any others who may be interested. It seems^ desirable, therefore, to arrange in order of their importance the lights required for the navigation of the Persian Gulf. This order is considered to be as follows :— (1.) Musandim. (2.) Maskat. (3.) Bushire. (4.) Shat-el-Arab (a light vessel). (5.) Muharrack (Bahrein). (6.) Fasht-ad-Dibal (Bahrein). (7.) Jezirat Kubbar (Koweit). (8.) Bandar Abbas. (9.) Ras-al-Arz (Koweit). (10.) Linga. 5. (c) Maintenance of Lights and Buoys.—It is suggested that the Government of India should be invited to arrange for the maintenance of the buoys and lighthouses in the Persian Gulf by the Royal Indian Marine, or in whatever manner they should think fit. . 6 - W Apportionment of Cost.—It is suggested that the cost should be divided equally between British and Indian revenues, this being the principle usually followed with regard to Persian expenditure. As to the amount, it has been already explained (paragraph 4) that no reliable estimate can be at present furnished. A. Mostyn Field. Edmond J. W. Slade, D.N.I. J. E.

To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. My Lord, Simla, the 13th August 1908. We have the honour to address you on the subject of the better lighting of the Persian Gulf, with a view not only to afford greater facilities of naviga tion but also still further to establish the predominant position of the British Government in that quarter. 2 . In paragraph 6 of their despatch of the 21st January 1904 attention was called by the Administration of Lord Curzon to the desirability of placing a light-house on some suitable site at the extremity of the Musandim Promontory; and in a telegram, dated the 21st September 1904, the Govern ment of India asked for the services of an expert to be engaged through the Trinity House to examine and report on the proposal as well as on the general question of lighting the Gulf. 3. No answer was received to that telegram ; but the general question has continued to occupy our attention, and the matter was recently brought promi nently to our notice, in connection with a proposed revision of the subsidy to be paid to the British India Steam Navigation Company for the fast weekly mail service to the Persian Gulf, when Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie, the Managing Agents of the Company, pointed out that one of the most serious difficulties in the way of accelerating and improving the mail service was the absence of lights which renders navigation dangerous except by daylight. 4. The matter is, in our opinion, one of great importance ; and we would propose, should His Majesty’s Government see no objection, that the general question of the better lighting of the Gulf be examined locally by an officer experienced in light-house construction, in conjunction with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the senior Naval Officer on duty in the Gulf, and the officer in charge of the Marine Survey of India. In the event of our proposal meeting with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, we would again request that the services of an expert be obtained through the Trinityr House, since no officer with the requisite experience is axailahle in India. The charges for his deputation would, we presume, he met in part hy His Majesty’s Government. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, C-f (CL1908. SIMLA.

Grey attaches great importance to the maintenance of this service in British hands, and he desires me to ask you whether in order that our position in regard to tho buoys may be made doubly secure, the British India S.N. Co. would still be willing, as sug gested by you in your letter to Mr. Maxwell of February 15, 1907, to make over their existing buoys to H.M.G., who would, Sir E. Grey hopes, be able to maintain them free of cost to the Co. for the bo- n„fi( of British shipping in tho Gulf. I may add that we are at present in communication with the Admiralty with regard to the lay ing down of some additional buoys in the Gulf waters, which would bo maintained by H.M.Govt: in connexion with those at present owned hy the British India S.N.

Dear Mr. Maxwell I i.ieriuioneci to you the other day, when at tns 1-oreign Office, that we had heard from India that the Hamburg American Company had proposed to our people there, that they should contribute to the up-keep of our Navigation Buoys in the Persian Gulf. We have told our people in reply that we prefer to continue to tear the cost of the maintenance of the buoys ourselves. As I mentioned to you, these buoys were put down by the British India Company some 20 or 30 years ago, and they have been kept in position and maintained by the Company ever since, and they have been used by all steamers frequenting the Per sian Gulf, without any charge having been made for their use by the British India Company. In fact we would have no means of collecting a charge, had we desired to make one. It was, of course, no disad vantage to us that other steamers should use the buoystta mmOm siRS buoys, and we had never thought of asking them to contribute. I cannot help fancying, as I mentioned to you at our meeting the other day, that there is a political move behind this proposal of the Hamburg American Company the otject being to give Germany a vested interest in the Persian Gulf. It has occurred to me that it might he a good tlung politically for us to make over the ownership of these huoys to His Majesty’s Government. I mav say at once that I don’t make the suggestion^ in order that the British India Company may benefit pe- cuniarily, exther in tne way of being repaid the cost of buoys, or in escaping from the charge for their maintenance. In fact, to avoid any idea of this sort, we should be quite prepared to hand the buoys over to the Government for a nominal considera tion, and we would still maintain them free of cost in return for their use. Yours sincerely.
