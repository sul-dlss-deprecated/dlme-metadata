LONDON Codes: BENTLEYS &amp; LATA 3 November 1936 Dear Mr Clauson I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon and I will try to tell you briefly the position with regard to the film which I mentioned to you Imperial Airways recently made a contract with the Strand Film Company Ltd of 37-39 Oxford Street, W.l., to make three films along the air route between England and Australia One of these films has the present title - although this may be changed later - of *A Day in the Life of a Station Superintendent' and we have decided to base this on Shargah because it is rather a romantic spot The film party will consist of four men, namely Mr R H P Keene, Mr G Alexander Shaw, Mr George Noble and Mr John Taylor. Only two of these will do any filming in Shargah, namely Mr Keene and Mr Taylor They will both leave Ehgland on 11 November and arrive in Shargah on 15 November. Mr Taylor will stay there until 22 November when he leaves for Basra and Mr Keene will stay there until 23 November when he continues on to Brisbane During that time we are anxious that they should take a documentary f ilm which will show the impact of civilization in the shape of an aeroplane on out of way spots. The films are of what is known as a documentary type, that is to say, they are not acted films and have no love interest but are used as a document to show the romantic side of everyday happenings MRmiLUiTEm •t 4® Itb d. l.ll.ilp. iWDM s&amp;ECRr&amp;Atn', rrc!' rrrcdu AMD SB&amp;BRET • DEPT.

CONTINUATION No! # We took a similar film four years ago soon after we had started to operate to Shargah and I personally went with the unit and saw the Sheikh and he was very kind indeed and took the film unit and myself through the town outside his palace and we photographed him, his children and his various retainers. He was so interested that he asked that we should send him still photographs ^ from the film which we did The unit which is going out is well aware of the peculiar position of the Trucial Coast and I am sure that, in company with our experienced Station Superintendent, they will do nothing to upset either the Sheikh or his entourage and subjects If there is anything you can do to help I am sure we shall be very grateful The film, after it has been made, will be released generally throughout the country Yours truly C F Snowden Gamble Publicity fefigggr M J Clauson Esq India fiffice Whitehall s..y i— PJ../XT/VH, (63 groups 0 ) R, &amp; O.
