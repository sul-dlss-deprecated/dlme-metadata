It is noted that the Imam had approached the Resident on the subject prior to his receipt of the aforementioned dispatch, and that he has requested that the particulars related to the activities of Captain William Owen are relayed to the Bombay Government.The item has two enclosures:1 - Translation of a letter from Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat to Sir Lowry Cole, Governor the Isle of France [Mauritius].The enclosure concerns the case of Bombassa Island; it notes that the matter has been referred to England, and that the island has been placed under the protection of the British flag. As a result, it notes the Imam has discontinued hostilities against the island.2 - Translation of the Imam's petition to the King of Britain, dated 6 December 1824, and submitted via Sir Lowry Cole.The enclosure concerns the 'improper proceedings' of Captain Owen of the Royal Navy at Bombassa; it is noted that the Imam has already applied to the Bombay Government for redress.The Imam's historical claim to the island is outlined in the letter, along with details of the rebellion in 1819 against his rule. It explains that the island had been recently recaptured by an expedition launched from Muscat, but that Captain Owen (having travelled to the island while claiming to be undertaking a survey) had encouraged the population to rebel once again; it claims that Captain Owen rendered his assistance in retaking Bombassa, and in attacking other possessions belonging to the Imam of Muscat.It is further noted that Captain Owen has seized boats belonging to the Imam's subjects, claiming that he has been authorised to seize any boats suspected of carrying slaves for Mohomedan [Mohammedan] countries. It is noted that this is contrary to the Imam's previous agreements with the British, which only prevents his subjects from trading slaves with Christian nations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x00004d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
