It was greatly to be feared th,at Tehran itself would become infected in view of the position of Shah Abdul Azim on the great road to the South, and of the streams of people who go there from the capital every week, either to visit the shrine or to indulge in less sober observances. As a matter of fact on depteiiber 26th, 27th and 28th seven definite cases of cholera occurred in the city in the following quarters:- Pa Machine, Pa Kanoq, Arp, : azaar, Dirvazeh oh Imran, /U1 these cases however had cor, e in from A hah Aodul Azim before the cordon had been formed .

(for the Minister) Right Honourable \| iicopy. j ^ Sir, TEHRAN'. May 2nd, I have the honour to report tnat a meeting of the sanitary Council was held today, Dr. Emir Khan, the President, in the chair. CHOLERA. Sporadic cases continue to occur in Resnt: on April 14th-2; lbth-1; 20th-l; May 1st-2; Cases are -still said to be occuring in Fumen and also at Gasht. as the conditions in the former place would now appear to permit of a doctor being sent there, it was decided to instruct Dr. Abdullah Khan, who is in charge of the sanitary arrangements at Resht, to go there and make a report. Quarantine is in force at Karraj, and travellers are examined on leaving Resht. There is an observation post at Manjil. A proposal of the Sanitary Commission at Kazvin to establish a quarantine station at Agha Baba (4 farsakh s from the town) was approved in principle, but there are no funds for fitting up a station. Only travellers to Kazvin would be detained. Travellers to other towns would not be allowed to center Kazvin. The local governor is anxious to use the ' navagiiil” for cleaning up the town, a measure for which the Russian authorities are clamouring, but the Persian Government has refused permission. The Government continues to refuse the supply funds for the steps which trie Council wish to take at Resnt and in the towns in communication with Resht, such as Enzeli, Kazvin and Tehran. The 'Impasse ' which has thus been reached, with my proposal for dealing His Majesty's Minister, Tehran.(24) dealing with it, is described in my memorandum of april 25th. A proposal wa§ made at the end of the meeting, that, in view of the Government's persis tent refusal to believe that cholera existed at Kesht a Commission of three should be sent by the Sanitary Council to investigate the disease, and that I should go as bacteriologist to the Commission. It seems to me, that the sending of such a Commission would give the Government an opportunity for further procrastina tion, and would cast a doubt on the strength of our frequently stated belief that cholera does exist at Hesnt and in the neighbourhood, as far as my taking part in the enquiry, it seems to me, that with the Russians so deeply interested in the matter, and with Russian doctors on the spot or close at hand at Baku, they should undertake the investigation promptly and withouo hesitation. I would further point out that, I am at present engaged in supervising sanitary im provements in the two negations, and in the village of Guinek. I am, Yours faithfully, (Signed) A. R. NELIGAN,M.D.A TEHRAN, py 65 ) May 10th, 1916. Sir, I have the^honour to report that a special meeting of the Sanitary Council was held today, to con sider the refusal of the Government to acknowledge that there is cholera at Resht. Dr. Emir Khan, the President, was in the chair. The President said that, after the meeting of the Commission de defense banltaire held on the 8th, he went to see the Prime Minister, and handed him a list of the measures wnicn rhe Sanitary Cpuncil wished to take, together with the original telegrams from the sanitary doctor at Resht. These showed tnat between May 2nd and 6th, II cases of cholera had occurred with 8, deaths. The Prime, minister denied the existence of the disease and wrote the following words at the foot of the memorandum: H Daprds renseignements pris, cholera, nexiste pas h Recht, et quiconque pretend quelle y existe, ne dit pas la verity V The meeting had therefore been called to discuss the pos ition. During the. week ending May 8th, 20 cases of cholera had been reported, with 16 deatns. I then read the telegran from the acting-Vice- Consul at Resht, in which he reported that, trie desease was spreading, and that a dozen cases had already occurred A telegram from the Director of Customs at Enzeli was also read;- 'Cholera sevit assez serieusernent a Recht. A Enzeli quelques cas dont un ferrache des Douanes .' A His Majesty’s Minister,A long discussion followed, and various propositions were made, among them one 'by Drs. Scott and Gaaala Bey, that the English and Russian representa tives should ask their Legations to intervene. I said it would seem useless for the Sanitary ■wouncil to continue its meetings, but that force of cir- cumsGances would eventually compel the Government to act; and that in the meanwnile, in view of our strong convic tions about the master, we could not relax our efforts to deal with what was steadily becoming an epidemic. 1 proposed that one Incest inionnation (given abovej should be handed to the Prime Minister, with a fresh written re monstrance , and a request to be informed whether the measures already in force, were to be stopped. As to the intervention of H. M. Legation, I would certainly recom mend it, especially in view of the fact, that the minis ter for Foreign affairs had regularly infomed the Lega tion of the presence of cholera at Resht. My proposal was adopted. Dr. Zaplotinsky was present at the meeting. He approved the decision taken, and regretted that he had no into mat ion go give. He would impress on his Legation the seriousness of the position. I venture to hope that action of the two Lega tions may no longer be delayed. At the close of the meeting the telegran of the Chief medical officer in the Persian Gulf, announcing quarantine against Mohammerah on account of plague, was read. I an, Yours faithfully, (Signed) A.

SIR, I have the honour t (0 report that a meeting of the Sanitary Council was held today Dr Emir Khan in the chair. CHOLERA AT RESHT. The order of events in connec tion with the re-appearance of cholera at Resht are as follows:- 1. torch 27th-Telegram from H.M. Vice-Consul reporting cholera. 2. torch 30th- Special meeting of 'Commision de Defense Sanitaire”.Telegram from Vice- Governor reporting four deaths at Chamul Sarai {a quarter of Resht). I expressed surprise that it should he left to a Consul toreport the first cases especially in view of the fact that the Sanitary Council had on torch 7th decided to take preventive meas ures at Resht. Dr Emir Khan replied that in spite of repeated applications the Ministry of Finance had refused to supply the funds necessary for paying medical officers and the many other expenses. The Commission at my instance then drew up and signed a formal protest to the Cabinet in which we threatened our resignation if funds were not at once ^ provided. Doctors were appointed for Resht and Enzeli with orders to act with the local authorities in an endeavour to stamp out the disease. An observation post was formed at tonjil and at Kazvin, Majesty* s Minister. Tehran.Kazvin, and 5 days quarantine for first and second class travellers fromitesht were ordered at Karraj, to date from the day of leaving, also 24hours observation for caravans. 3. April 1st. Meeting of Commission. Telegram from Resht: cases observed at Poosheh and Tolem. An order had been issued f or the payment of the necessary finds to the Council. The methods of dealing with an epidemic at Tehran were discussed, and I was asked to write a popular account of cholera and how to avoid it, for distribution. 4. April 3rd. Meeting of Commission. Telegram from Resht: no fresh cases. From the above account, which was laid before the Meeting, it will be seen that the Sanitary Council has done what is possible; but the lack of support by the Persian Government leads me to think that it would be reasonable, if H.M.Legation and the Russian Legation (represented as they are in the Council) would formally urge the Cabinet to assist the Council financially and otherwise in carrying out its plans. Personally I do not think it at all certainthat we are going to have a big 4 epidemic, but cholera has been smouldering in and about Resht, and a serious effort should be made to stamp it out.

The meeting was opened by dr. Gazala Bey an nouncing the appointment of Dr. dmir Khan, fne Beeretary read the flnaan while the members stood.

Dr. ofiplotinsky also spoke in sup,on oi it. Dr. i^mir Khan replied that the Sanitary Council had no rule limiting the i reeidentship to anyone in particular, md Uiat as the 1 •st holder of tiie )Ost vas not returning to iersia, it became accessary to select a ue v iresident. He did not conside that any injustice had been done. The protest which had been read would of course be eommmiic ited to the x ersian aovenment ... cl tlie matter would be dealt with by it. ho other member spoke and i am therefore unable to say what effect the protest caused beyond that oi surprise. \ The appointment or Dr. Jmlr Khan is a popular one and is the best hunt could be fa ale from among the Persian members, he is the most fitted as regards scientific ni general knowledge and speaks french well. He holds a trench quallflca ring studied at nyons. and at laris, he is a protagonist cf the Sjeunes persans* and was at one time a member of the Democratic party in the i.ajlic. he has however enough savolr fiifre to prevent his going to extremes, lie is a lecturer at the Dar ul Faiiun and would be glad to see the two French professors replaced by Persians. He sees no doubt ,doubt in his nomination ae iresident of the Sanitary Council a reason niich arm be used in the future for preventing their return; for as Monsieur Lecomte points out in the case, of nr. Cachet who left Persia when the -var begin a provision was actually inserted in his contract that he should be president of the Council* If tno preach professors do not return it will do regretuciDio on aiany grounus one beiiig uiiat their wor,c here was a counterpoise to Ceram influence There can be no two opinions about the manner in which the nomination has been made known - simply inserted as it was, in a 1 etore, , de convocatlPil issued taiftv six hours before m emergency mooting. 1 am he *, (oigned) i.eiigaa*N In Any further communica tion on this subject, please quote u No. ess— /Ci / [1916 If* and address— / V— - The Under-SecreUry of State Foreign Office, n o U (j London.

Sir, I have tne honour zo report tnat a meeting of the Sanitary Council was held, to-day Dr. Gazala Bey the Vice-President in tne cnair. Cholera Cases have been reported from Astara, Enzeli , Resht, Ardobil (2o cases) and Kazvin. Kazvin November 2oth - 'some cases with 2 or 3 deaths.' M 22nd 8 cases since appearance off! rst. ' 30th 9 cases with 5 deaths since first appear ance of disease. No new cases for four da^e The reports mentioned cases among tne Russian troops and stated that a local sanitary commission was co-operating with tne Russian authorities in dealing with the outbreak. The Russian delegate gave information similar to the above. Quaiantine station at Karra ,j. When choiera was reported at Kazvin tne Commission de Defense Sanitaire decided to entorce five days quarantine at narraj, trie point where tne river ot that name is crossed by a bridge on the Tehran- Kazvin road 30 miles from the capital. The old 'palace' of Path Majesty's Minister Tehran.i'ath All Shah had already oeen cnosen as the quarantine station out there were no funds tor its equipment, a few days before the meeting 500 tomans had oeen extracted irom the government and a beginning had been iade and some guards had been sent out* A iersiaa doctor had already been there tor a month. The meeting decided to hurry on the arrangements, to entorce 24 hours quarantine for trie present and to increase this to 5 days as soon as there was accom modation and if fresh cases occurred at Kazvin. The latest report of the doctor at Karraj spoKe of three 'suspect' cases under observation, but it would seem highly improbable that they were cases of cnoiera. It was further decided to attempt to prevent travellers trom leaving the main road in order to escape quarantine. The Kazvin epidemic, if so few cases deserve the name, seems to be ot a very mild type and it is quite lively, view the lateness of Jdie season, that it will not spread. It is always a moot point whether in a country like this much can be done to combat an epidemic among Hie native population, but it is certain that in its present financial position trie Sanitary Council can do very littie.

Dr Gazala Bey, VicePre- sident in the chair. ..S^t » Tho Pors ian Coneul General sav ing reported fresh cases ( 31 fror January 27 to February 22) it was decided to continue the redical inspection of trav- ‘ ellers fror Mesopotamia at Casrishirin, and to keep Dr Brunei, a Belgian doctor froir Kenranshah, there. in the Persian Gulf. Major MacPherson's ! last telegram about the epidemic at Bahrein and the discover, at Bushire of a case on a b^at from the islands, was read. The VicePresldent added that everything was being done in J he most capable wat by the local sanitary ser vice. Behai was declared free of plague and the restrictions taken against that place had been reroved. After the reports of coirr issions ( hyg iene and personnel ) had been read a long discussion about he EgiSlairsut Iute.r.Uhi£ began.

The re presentative or the Ministry or the Interior then said that his department had decided that the reglenGiit needed revis ion and that a commission had been appointed to carry it out; he mentioned the names of several members of the Council, none Of them Europeans. I replied that this method of procedure was extraordinary: the Sanitary Council was the best judge cf its own rules, but it was being coerced into revising them and perhaps altering them without its opinion having been v asked. There were undoubtedly lacunae in the rules but the proper *&amp;$ to approach the matter was to take the opinion of the Council as to whether the time had come to revise them. If the Council decided in favour of revision then a com mission ought to be appointed to carry it out* This commiss ion should report to the Council and %he approved alterat ions or additions, if any, should be submitted to.the Min- is try of the Interior • After further discussion, during which it was pointed out that the Council was a Persian Council and a department of the Ministry of the Interior, a View which I strongly upheld, it was decided that the time had come to revise the existing rules, and a commission was appointed to that end, with the following members: — V ^ DPs Gazala Bey, Amir hlan.

Yesterday the Persian quarantine doctor telegraphed that he had detained a man, who probably had ■bubonic plague. In a written report just received he des cribes two further cases which were probably plague. It was decided :- 1 « To send a doctor from Kemianshah to Kasri-Shirin to assist in dealing with the greet number of pilgrims which would shortly be returning. 2, To continue the medical examination at Kasri-Shirin. b# To provide money and guards as were required. 4.

The only decision of importance taken was one to build a. small quarantine station on the road, to Kerb el a at Kasri-Shirin.

A telegram was received from the Persian Cons'll at Baghdad, in October, announcing that two cases of plague had occurred. The Turkish authori ties had taken precautions on the Tigris. As Persia is still without a quarantine estab iishment on the Turco-Persian frontier to corres pond with the Turkish station at Khanikin, it was decided to form an observation station at Kasr-i- i Shirln as in the case of previous epidemics in Mesopotamia 3ir W.Townley, K.C.M.G.,Mesopotamia, There is a Persian Doctor at Kasr who has had experience before in this work. It was further decided to call upon the Belgian doctor who is employed by the Treasury at Kermanshah, should the epidemic assume serious proportions. For the present travellers will have to undergo a simple medical inspection. If it was found impossible to control the traffic at Kasr-i~ Shir in, it was decided to fall back to Pa-i-Taq where there is a defile through which all roads pass. It was pointed out however that there is no village or caravanserai at this point, and that therefore the personnel of the station and any travellers who might have to be de tained, would have to live in tents - not a pleasant prospect at this time of the year.

Dr. Cachet the President In the chair. The Sanitary Commission sent by the Constantinople Board of Health to the southern half of the Turco- Perslan frontier has, as you know, completed Its labours. Dr. Samuel Khan, the Persian representative on the Board, and a member of the Commission, has come to Tehran at the request of the Sanitary Council and was present at this meeting. He brought a voluminous report and read a short resume of the Comnlss Ion's work. From the Persian point of view the principal point In this resume was his advocacy of the building of a quarantine station In the neighbourhood of Kasr-past but has not had the necessary funds. Dr. Sanuel Khan also referred to his success in persuading the Constantinople Board to exempt Persians domiciled near the Turco-Perslon frontier from paying the sanitary tax to which everyone who crosses the frontier is liable. The Council thanked Dr. Samuel Khan for his report and it was decided to recommend the Government to give him a fixed salary and a decoration. The case of suspected cholera at Enzeli . On June 15th. an extraordinary meeting of the Sanitary Council was called to consider a telegram from the Medical Officer at Enzeli in which he reported a case of death from cholera. I was not present at the meet ing as the notice convening it did not reach me until it was over. The usual precautions about the burial and the disinfecting of the house were taken, and, as no further cases have been reported it would seem improbable that the case was one of cholera. Plague at Tourkend (Baku). No further cases have been reported and the inspection of ships in the Caspian was stopped on June 15th. All the deaths occurredI occurred In a single family.

As reported in my account of the special meeting held on May 17th, instructions were telegraphed to the Caspian ports and the Caucasian frontier for a medical inspection of travellers entering Persia. Four days elapsed hefore the inspection was begun at Enaeli, owing to the medical officer refusing to act until he had received instructions from the Customs whose doctor he is. The Russian Legation drew attention to the absence of precautions and offered lend a doctor from a 'stationnaire'.

It is now announced that a hospital of 50 beds is to be built there and that a Belgian Doctor is on his way to take charge of it. There can be no doubt that the stronger the sanitary service at Kermanshah is, the better, in view of its situation on a pilgrim route. Cow houses in Tehran . A petition has been received from the cowkeepers against the order which the Municipality has recently issued to the effect that cows may no longer be kept in the town. Several members criticised the order adversely and it was pointed out that the Sanitary Council recommended that only those cowkeepers who had foul premises should be expelled. An annual rrop;ramrne of sanitary reforms . A Persian member, Emir Khan, proposed that in conse quence of the frequent difficulties with the Treasury about money, a programme of sanitary reforms and ex penditure should be submitted annually to the Govern- :' meatGovernment.

The President refused to provide it - saying that everything v/as bought against a receipt, and that the Treasury could send an official to see the re ceipts if it cured to uo so. This is a small matter and would not be worth mentioning were it not another instance of interference with the Council by the Treasury. The Morphine habit . Since a tax on opium has been collected the use of morphine has increased enormously in Persia. It was decided to recommend the Government to take action and I proposed that the question of cocaine should also be considered. The Propos ed Quarantine Station on the Kerbela It has always been intended to build a station at route.at Kasr-i-Shirin to correspond with the Turkish station at Khanikin. Dr. Feistmantel, the Austrian Delegate, (who was present for the first time for several mouths) read at this meeting a Memorandum which he had drawn up as a result of ms journey thi’ough the district in the summer of last year. He proposed that the idea of quarantine should be given up, and that simply a medical inspection should be made at Pn-i-Taq and (by arrangement with the Turkish authorities) at Khamkin. The d-scust^on of the proposal was deferred. At this same meeting the Austrian delegate pro- poaod certain oanit&amp;ry reforns ut Kun, and also the aahin'' of u •kunaat’* at Kornunshah to supply the town with good water: this tcanaat to be aufie with the noney which the Sanitary Council derives from the tax on dead bodied on their way to Kerbela and which is collected at Kermanshah. The money in question has always teen ear-marked by the Council for the making of a quarantine station on the pilgrim route. The results of the mission on which the Austrian Delegate was sent by the Treasury last summer withoutthe cognizance of Hie Majesty's Legation cr of the \ - h Sanitary Council, are at last coming out.

Flange. An epidecic hac been reported from the Turco-Perei&amp;n frontier in the neighbourhood of Van. Other reports say that the epidemic is due to M influenza and typhoid fever”. The Turkish delegate had no information. The Constantinople Toard has representatives in the district : the Persian Ambassador has therefore been instructed to tele - graph their reports as soon &amp;b possible. finance. A letter was read from the Treasurer-General in which he said that 'as he had told the President more than once', the 15,000 ? 0 E&amp;rw which are set aside annually,as a fi rb t clia.^e on t. northern Ountome receipts ,for sanitary measures in the north of Persia,are not to ho considered as part of the Council' t income,but are to be paid only for dealing with extraordinary and urgent situations ; in other words the Council was to deal only witn epidemics as they appeared,and was not to spend money on imfoving the sanitary defences and conditions of the country in the years in which there were no serious outbreaks or threatening--- o,. epidemic Gachet said that the Treasurer-General had never made such fir b.Townley,K.C.i . O. » 8cG •suoh a Etatenent to hiru and that so Tar the money had been paid in regular instalments. There was nothing in the archives of the 'ounoil which would allow such a construction to be put on the methods of expenditure of the sum in question. He proposed to reply in this sense to i onsieur kornard and not to take any further step until the next instalment was due. I do not know the exact wording of the Convention of 1618 (?) by whiolx the Persian &lt;iebt was converted , but there is no doubt that in the , present state of the Treasury,honeieur kornard would be Llad to have this £3,000 for other purpo - ses. nation. ®- e results of ■the public vaccination service for tne last three months occupied the serious attention of tne Pi - nance commission last month. It was found that each vaccination had cost the altogether excessive amount of Krans 4.50 (four-and-a-half krans) . It was in - possible to diminish the expenditure and the alter native was to increase the number of vaccinations performed, in this connection it had to oe noted that Persians do not care for vaccination in the winter and that the number of un-vaocinated people . . a now very much smaller than it was two in Tehran is now -v •- 'i c o’jiiQ of the vaccination years, or even a year,a*o. 0i « + 'draw” very badly and it wa*.. oentree wore found to dra. v ry d.oia.s to »dvit. .!». =“” 011 “ «, ..Od.t-to-d.u,. vttolntuon » «o \ towntown.

The Treas - ury has promised improvements. The improvement in the Tehran Police has en - couraged the 'Commission dh^giene' to draw up a set of sanitary Laws for the city.

A letter from the Gentian Minister to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was read asxlng that more attention should be paid to the lepers in the Tabriz district. The efforts of Mrs. Wanneman (wife of the American Mission doctor at Tabriz) on their behalf were mentioned and it was stated that a German society had subscribed £50 for the amelioration of the lepeie' lot. Persian members present described the regulations made by the Government for the isola tion and feeding of the unfortunates. It would appear however that little is done for them or for the pro tection of others. It was decided to thanK the German Minister for drawing attention to the subject,, to re quest the Government to see that the regulations were carried out, and to collect information on the question of leprosy generally in Persia.
