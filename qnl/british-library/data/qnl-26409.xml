Dear Harrison, With reference to our meeting at the Commonwealth Relations Office on 1st April, I enclose herewith copy of a letter addressed by me to Colbeck, the Alternate U.K. Represent ative on the Council of I.C.A.O. and also copy of my earlier letter of 13th January, 1948 referred to therein. Yours sincerely. F.A.K, Harrisoi Comao nwe alt! Downing S' S.W.1.R. 37925 A7/S.P. 3. 13 it- January, 1948 Dear Colbeck, • - - Y^ith reference to your letter dated 20th November, 1947 1348/298, regarding a request from the President for agreement Wj^rect contact between the Colonial Office and I. C.A.O. Field Representatives, I have written the 77ar Office, thei Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office regarding the territories mentioned in para, 2 of your letter and have now received the following replies. The Y/ar Office state that they have no objection to direct contact between the I.C.A.O. Field Representatives, and territories in the Middle East under British Administration provided that the matters discussed were purely of an administrative and technical nature. The Foreign Office replied on 5th January, to the effect that of the territories mentioned, Bahrein, Koweit and Oman will continue to oe the responsibility of the Commonwealth Relations Office until 1st A£*ril, 1948, that they would have to consider again nearer the time the possibility of direct contact after that date, and they did not forsee any great difficulty. British and Italian Somaliland and Libya are the responibility of the War Office. At the present time they would be most reluctant to have any relations with Egypt ccnrplicated still further by an attempt to secure joint action by the two codomini, and d.oubt whether, in view of the Egyptian attitude towards the 1936 Treaty, such joint action could be achieved. The Commonwealth Relations Office replied on 8 th January to us that so far as Bahrein, Koweit and the Trucial States (which include Sharjah) are concerned, relations with I, C. A. 0. , come under the aegis of His Majesty's Oovernment in the United Kingdom, who are responsible for the international relations of these States. They think that local contacts of I.C.JuC. - ie^a C.M. Colbeck, Esq, Alternate U.K. Representative on the Council of I. C.

I note your opinion that the responsibilities of the political resident need to be clarified and placed on a definite basis as you are somewhat in the dark as to what is likely to be required of him in future by way of advice. We are in full agreement with the proposal that a discussion should take place on the general subject with the F. 0, and M.C.

F.A.K.Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Officef - 4 CQMvrENTS OF. THE UNITED KINGDOM ON TrIE F Iii,L KKPOHT ON T?IE 3RD SESSION OF THE ^ DIVISIOin 1)00.460977 The United Kingdom are in general agreement with the substance of j-ocument Af .609 as a basis for securing, in the light of present knowledge, some measure of uniformity in the development of internationally agreed standards and recommended practices for aerodromes and ground aids, follaving paper contains two additional reservations relating to strip lengths and the installation of I.L.S. and also incorporates coirunents on various parts of Doe, 1.809 which the IJ.K. consider require alteration or amendment, 3» In puouing forward tneso comments, it is desired to emphasise that they &lt;..re based on ohe understanding that the standards and recoonended practices for aerodromes and ground aids laid down by I.C.^.O. will bo modified as my bo necessary when further experience has been gained from their practical application and in the light of future aeronautical developments. 4. STRIP LFITrTHS (Part IV, Section 2, Para. 2.1.2.2.) The present wording of para. 2.1.2.2. states that the basic strip should extend 200 feet beyond each end of thee.runway which it encloses. 2 _« 1 . 1 ,t(c) recommends that the instrument approach areas at both ends of instrument runways should be cleared to ground level, as nearly as practicable, for a distance of 1,000 feet. In the opinion of the U.K. it is desirable that the sorip length should not be fixed at 200 feet but that 1,000 foot should, where possible , 1 be attained to provide ample allowances not only for the installation of I.L.S. and possible future extensions but also for the effects cf Temperature accountability. In view of the above, the U.K, desire to enter a reservation on the quesoion of STRIP LENGTH until a further study of Temperature Accountability and other factors has been made. 5. DEFINITION of the term 'b .IKPQRT '. (Part IV, Section l) In the opinion of the U.K. the present 1.0. ,.0. definition of the term 'AIRPORT” is unsatisfactory since the fact that an aerodrome must provide 'facilities available to the public for the shelter, servicing sand repair of aircraft' would remove an unwarranted number of aerodromes from the 'AIRPORT' category. For economic and other reasons, such facilities are, in some instances provided in the U.K. .nd other.countries for use by scheduled services only; they are not, therefore, available for public use. For this reason it appears desirable to amend the definition for 'ZlRPORT' to include aerodromes where the facilities for the shelter, servicing or repair of aircraft are not necessarily available t o the public . Furthermore, there seems to be no good reason for retaining the term .'^irfield' and it is considered that this term should bo deleted. It is not mentioned in the jfeiGA document and none of the requirements relate to 'airfields'. The word is avoided in the case of water aerodromes and is equally unecoessary in the use of land aerodromes. 6 . SUBMISSION OF SURFACE WIND D^TA . (Part V, Para.12.1) (i) The method of summarising surafee winds is under consideration by the Climatological Commission of I.M.0. and liaison on this matter between the Commission and I.C.-»..0. is required. (ii) It is believed that the Commission will recommend summarisation in points and by Beaufort force (in knots) and it is, therefore, considered that the A.G-.A. recommendations should contain similar units. /(iii) CIV. 16669(iii) r^uiJJl 0 PU K PJS0 / f the aata collo otod is to calculate the ^ ° f r V n#la y s * 3000 interpolation will bo necessary f , 0 e in orniation roquirod relates to cross vdrd COiiPOIffiM ’3 of not noro than 13 knots. Hence the use of a lindtlF^ ^ speed of 13 knots will not facilitate the confutation.

For accurate St.tistics, observations at 1 hour or 3 hour intervals, providing ^tCr+ SP ™°r the 24 hours, appear to be equally satisfactory, and hourly observations* as a ninimn, are considered to bo excessive* the follOV7in S wording bo substituted for the definitions of desirable data in 12*1 p* 93 , ^l,-.aC' 2 .Lu;:.

FREQUENCY OF OBSERVATION Binds read from anonograms as means of 10 minutes •entred at hourly intervals. Where an anemometer is not available precaution must bo taken to summarise the mean wind over a period of minutes, not the extreme guat. If not av-iil.bie for every hour of 2k, it is essential that observations be equally spaced throughout 2 q. hours and net less than 8* observations made per day. 7. THRESHOLD LIGHTS, (part IV, Section 3, Para. 3.7.6.3. (a) In the yisw yf the u.K. the light distribution clause (3.7.6.3(a)) should bo rcuuced to die status of Re comae nded Practice in conformity with the similar specifications for Runway Lights (3.7.5.3.(b)). „ . _* iS P rQ sently classified, there is an inconsistency in that runway lights s_ culd^show at all engles up to at least 30 above the horizontal' while threshold lights shall do so. The distribution of light from runway lights and threshold lights must bo related the one to the other c„nd this may be impossible in certain circumstances unless both paragraphs are of a similar status (i.e. Recomraended Practices). 8 * TaXI iiOLLING POOITIOiT I.^RCINa. ( 4809 . 3.9.1.2. p.62 and Fig. 24 p.86) The taxi holaing position markings are shown as a double broken, and a double continuous line. This duplication appears unnecessary and it is suggested that a single broken and a single continuous lino would be adequate. 9. COLOUR OF THRESHOLD LIGHTS. (Part IV, Section 3, para. 3»7»6.3»(a)) and RUN.iaY DISTLi.i':GL f^RKIN. (Part IV, Section 3, paras. 3«6.3»3» and 3* 7. 5«3. (a)). The U.K. desire to re-affirm their reservations entered on these items during the course of the 3nd Session. 10. aNOLE OF, .JTRC.CH LICriiTS . (Part IV, Section 3, para. 3.5.1.3.) The U.K. wish to draw attention to the fact that the permissible angles of the beam for angle of approach indicators differs from that of the COT CIV. 16669 /Division’s-3- Division's roquiromont for the sotting of I.L.S. boanis* Consequently, it is ^considered that a note should be inserted recomniending that angle of approach :dicators and I.L.S. should not be used sinultanoously• _Iiw-jT^IiL. 4 .TIvL OF j. ,L.3 . (part V, Kecomonlation 2) The U.L. desire to reserve their position with regard to this recomuendation since it is considered that the iratter fails outside the scope of the division. 12. FIGURE 3 . There is a slight error in the figure in that the approach surface slope on the right hand side of the diagram should be extended through the horizontal suifa.ee (see corrected diagram attached).CIV, 16788, mmm M&amp;aamuL- MBJISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATIQN/AIR MINISTRY CQ-“QRDELATING CQIvgvilTTEE General Principles and Prac tices to be followed at Joint-User Airfields Overseas INTRODUCTION 1 * -n TheSG Pr u nCiP A? S and P ractices wil1 apply equally to other stations ~eao, sue as Air Traffic Control Centres, which it is decided to operate on a joint-user basis. r GDNSRAL RESPONSIBILITY Joan i t 7 user airfields overseas are those at which facilities are provided of raght on a n agreed joint basis for both military and civil aircraft, Ihe administration and organisation of such airfields will thus be the responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding concerned and of the local Government in whose territory the airfield is situated. It will be necessary at each airfield 1 or Air Officers Commanding to consult with local Governments in order to carry out the general policy which has been agreed. Commanding Officer will bear complete responsibility for the discipline and administration of service personnel and, within the limits normally applicable on an R.A.P, station, of any Air Ministry civil staff and employees. The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on behalf of the local Government concerned will be the responsibility of the local Government. An officer of the local Government concerned will be placed m charge of such civilian staff. A. Notwithstanding the fact that either the service or civilian interests particular airfield will always predominate, the R.A.P. Commanding Officer and the Senior Civil Officer will each deal with their own subordinates only, so far as disciplinary enquiries and disciplinary action are concerned, except that in any cases where both service and civilian interests may be affected, a general enquiry may be held by mutual agreement. The R.A.P. Commanding Officer and the Senior Civil Officer will each issue any day-to-day administrative instructions which may be required to their own subordinates. There will be no question of the direct subordination of the Senior Civil Oxficer to the R.A.P. Commanding Officer or vice versa but for opera.tional convenience subordinate staff on duty may be placed in the charge of a Senior Officer either civil or R.A.F. j. His Majesty’s Government are obliged, by international agreements, to provide facilities for the lawful passage of civil aircraft, both British and foreign, on the international trunk routes. Certain local air services operated by local airlines will also use joint-user airfields. It is not possible for H.M.G. to deny the use of airfields open to international air traffic to international and local airlines (except in time of national emergency when the facilities may be denied to all operators, either completely or partially, on a non-discriminatory basis; action in emergency would only be taken on instructions from or with the specific approval of Departments in London). It yri.ll not therefore be open to an R.A.P. Commanding Officer at a joint-user airfield to issue orders precluding the use /of4 CIV,16788. - 2 , of the airfield by civil operators, British or foreign. It will be the responsibility of the local Government to check the entitlement of civil operators. In the same way it will not be open to a local Government t^ prevent the passage of service aircraft in order to safeguard particular ivil requirements. Clearance for the passage of foreign military aircraft will be co-ordinated by the Air Ministry. iP ' 1 P eace “'k^ ine R.a.F. have certain strategic obligations which can only bo met by keeping open a certain defined route capacitywhich may not be required in full except under threat of emergency, but which must be kept at all times available. It may therefore be necessary at joint-user airfields to formulate quotas for^service and civil use. The service quota would take lull account of strategic needs and the civil quota would be available for distribution among those civil operators who had been granted rights to operate to the airfield concerned. The quotas to be applied at each airfield would be a matter for separate discussion in each case and v/ould be subject tc revision on account of any alteration by agreement in the balance of civil and strategic needs or of any physical alteration to the airfield which affected' its total capacity. FINANCE /, In order to avoid complicated and unnecessary accounting the formula for the division of cost between R.A.F. and civil accounts should be simple to t-Pply even if this entails a certain sacrifice in accuracy of apportionix-nt* 8 . Because of the difference between the salaries, allowances,- conditions of service, etc. of K.a,!* , and civil staffs the cost of control and telecommunications stafis will be omitted from the pool account (sec paragraph 10 below) and an attempt will be made to obtain a fair division of cost by allocating the facilities to be provided by the R.A.F. and Civil Authorities respectively on a basis proportionate to service and civil re quire me nt s • 9# Agreement will be reached from time to time on the capital expenditure or assets necessary to provide facilities for joint use, the ownership of which shall rest with one party. The owner of capital assets will then charge to the pool account a rental which will include amortisation of the capital value of the item over an agreed period of years. All equipment supplied oolely lor civil or R.a.F. use will be provided by the appropriate authority -xHu. no charge will be made to the pool account j where appropriate such equipment will be clearly marked. Pool Account 10. A pool account, normally maintained by the local Government, will be set up at each joint-user airiielc to record actual expenditure and assess costs for the maintenance and operation of joint-user services other than expenditure on control and telecommunications staffs (see paragraph 8 above). These charges will be debited to the pool account and credited to the Department or Government that bears the expenditure in the first instance or is entitled to the rental. Capital works and other services used solely for civil or solely for R.A.F. purposes will be excluded. Landing fees and concession rentals on the civil site will also be excluded. /Division' -3- Division of Costs aafron^Lr?^^ ' dll + be ad J' usted a period of six months from [' d t0 on &gt;hlch tho account is opened and thereafter annually. the oolt°of“minted , Wi1 ^ b ° ^ n , tW ° parts ’ Part 1 of which will represent of which will inel nan 00 !“■ nd - t ' ontal of tho runways and taxiways and Part II pool account ln p ladc T all 11 ot ^r expenditure or rentals appropriate to the \ 4 .T..

Similarly the R.A.F. will supply all service type equipment and associated spares. 24. The stages by which and the extent to v/hich civil type equipment is introduced will be arranged between the Air Ministry, M.C.A. and other Departments and Overseas Administrations concerned. LEGAL LIABILITY 25. The question of legal liability in respect of actionable damage- resulting from errors committed by ground personnel (control and telecoixiumcations staff etc.) is governed by general principles of law as set out hereunder. These principles will not be affected by the fact that an airfield is joint-user. - • Furthermore the principles referred to also apply whether the ground - personnel are servicemen or civilians and whether the aircraft or other property damaged is State or civil, British or foreign. . . Tort 27. If there is negligence in the U.K. in relation to any aircraft an action for tort will lie in the U.K.; if the negligence occurs in a foreign country an action for tort will lie in the U.K. if the act complained of is both wrongful in the foreign country and actionable if committed in the U.K. 28. In territories where the Grown Proceedings Act, 1947, does not apply, if the R.A.P. or M.C.A. employ a controller etc., the employing authority would normally, according to current practice, meet the cost of ary damage resulting from errors of the employee which amount to negligence actionable in the English courts. .here the authority employing the controller, etc. is a colonial or local Government abroad the law of the place will apply. In general it may perhaps be assumed that Colonies etc. would be likely to follow the generally accepted procedure of making ex gratia payments where liability of the employee is reasonably clear and otherwise leaving the aggrieved person vith only his remedy, if any, against the individual tort feasor.-5“ 29. In territories where the Grown Proceedings Act, 1947&gt; is in force Aug. the U.K.) where the R.A.F, or M.C.A. employ a controller the Crown vx.e. R.A.P. or ) will be liable to be sued in tort* 30. The Act in its application to torts is only concerned with torts, of servants of the Crown remunerated out of the consolidated fund monies provided by Parliament etc.. Provided the tortfeasor is so remunerated the Act applies \/herever the tort is committed but there can be no question of its 'extension' to cover cases where the employing authority is a c^plonial or local Government; in such cases the local law would still apply (see paragraph 28 above). Contract 31* So far as liability in contract is, concerned it will depend on the 'proper law of the contract', i.e. the law which the parties intend shall govern the contract. In default of evidence as to intention this is usually taken to be the lav/ of the place where the contract was made. 32* The contract of employment might affect the relations between employer and employee in the case of an accident but it could not govern the relations of employer or employee with third parties. For example there might be a condition that the employee should be dismissed if an action in an English court established that he was negligent in discharging his duties; but there could not be a condition that the employer would not be liable to third parties for the torts of the employee* 33* Liability as between the employing authority and the person suffering damage may be affected by any contract between them. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL GeneraT' 3A. All control procedures, whether control is by R.A.F. or civil, will be those• formulated by I.C.A. 0 . 33* In the case of civil aircraft control procedures can be advisory and not mandatory. Airfield and Approach Control 33. One authority, either R.ii.F. or civil, v/ill be responsible for airfield (and where applicable approach) control. 37* This authority will also be responsible for the manning of all ground services concerned with control, with the exception of telecommunications, required to cover both R.A.F. and civil needs, v/ithout regard to the number of personnel involved. 38 . Where civil control staff take over before the introduction into the R.A.F. of full I.C.A*0, procedures an R.A.F. control officer will-be retained to ensure that R.A.F. a.ircraft are controlled in accordance with current R.A.F. regulations. 39. Where the control authority is civil the provision of information of a 'restricted' category concerning purely R.A.F. facilities will be the responsibility of the R.A.F. flight planning' staff located at the airfield concerned. 40. Then the R.A.F. require to use airfields for operational or training purposes where the control authority is civil, they will put in R.A.F. staff /to CIV, 1 6788 ,r e' -7 equipment required by the R.A*P. or Civil Authorities and v/ill be responsible for the overall technical efficiency and operation of telecommunications staff and equipment. The choice of authority as between R.A.F. and civil will in each case be settled by discussion between the Departments concerned •yind m consultation with the local authorities. In general the larger user will predominate but due weight must also be given to strategic factors. 49* As a broad principle common procedures will be 'employed on each common air route. ■^ 0 * ji - s f ar a^ possible joint-user radio and control facilities will employ I.C.A.O. standards and frequencies, 51. As a long-term policy adequate training in I.C.A.O. procedures will be included in the syllabuses of R.A.F. signals training schools. 52. A joint aeronautical communications traffic office will be required to deal with aeronautical traffic as classified by I.C.A.O.. ^ ■j ' 3 h°P eCi - eventually that the aeronautical fixed telecommunications service will function as a separate organisation from other service and civil administrative and operational circuits. o4. .At /ground circuits at j^ir Traflic Control Centres v/ill be civil manned. 55. ./here the R.A.F. operate airfield and approach control they will as far as possible also operate and maintain the associated radio facilities and vice versa. j 6 * ,&lt;here main point—to—point and air/ground channels are civil manned the traffic office will as far as possible also be civil manned and vice versa. 57* Appropriate arrangements will need to be made for the provision of any additional telecommunications staff required to meet any large end sustained increase in air movements that may arise. 58. During the initial period of build-up and development it will be necessary to review the joint plan as a whole from time to time. P.l. 2nd March, 1948.

Aeronautical Information'arid Liaison Section will be established as part of the Luqa airfield/approach control section. Further, in view of the string strategic interest which the R.A.F. have in this centre, it had been agreed that:- (a) Control of all policy matters connected with the organisation and implementation of air traffic control within the Malta F.I.R. in relation to c “'’■ordination with adjacent r. l.R. control authorities shall be exercised through the A.O.C.

These relate to design* tion of routes and airports for the use of 'international sir services . It is perhaps unfortunate that the tern 'designstea for sohcduled air traffic' should have obtained more ourr.xqv, as toe altered phr; seology has no signlfiocr.ae. The twe -mloa »re peraissive and, ss you say, jravide a usoftil safegiara against the oonsequenoes of the general availability of all air ports o.wn to publio use. i am therefore by no mesne dear why it should be thought that there are serious objections to operating these talcs In pert - to the extent of ueai-neting airyorts without designating rtiutes - or by inatslaentr, first cif?»lgrir tir^ airports* and route* aeparateiy and auLamquentXy, At A»A*Wa Lanc^rmore, ^sq., ^orcii^i Officw* London, *&gt;.*. 1.At flr^t glance, It aight appear that designation of elroorts without designation of routes achieves no useful aujrxme, but that procedure which we regard as permissible does here the effect of tadtljr excluding airports which hare not been designated free us# by international air serrlcee and provides a skeleton framework of available routes as a starting point for subsequent negotiation of rights to use them. . designation of airports in itself confers no exercisable right u &gt;on anyone; it ie in effect a restrictive intimation to which the foreign operator cf international air services Bust pay heed in establishing and defining his effect!vs rights to fly into and land in the ^t&amp;ie concerned. lou have suggested however, that general designation unuer Article 68 does weaken our bargaining position. would suggest that this has not in fuct been the oa^e in the paat. * e would slab put forward the view thut we are under a moral obligation to I.C.iUO. to let them know where our intGrr.ijtional airports are, quite regardless of any right* that my be exercised in connection therewith. After all, we are not trying to be secretive and we feel that I»C«A.Q* hen a right' to general information about Matters with which it has been set up to deal. One suoh Matter obviously, is interruxtional air&gt;orts. Admittedly, instead of designating under Article 68, we could use syme other auch phrase as 'the following are international airports wz thin the terms of suck, and such a definition'', hut we think that this is a cumbersome aiid needless ;jrocedure. To take a particular example of your point, te cannot see that the fact that we have designated London Airport and Prestwick under Article 68 nekes the slightest /difference- -4 . difference to «iy ae^o tint! one nw may be under taking in regard to the use of one of thoee two aerodromes* Whether we designate or not, everyone know* perfectly well that we hove airports at '•^don and Prestwick* Our ability to wt airlines t rough Prestwick der&gt;eiui8 inter alia on our right, under Article 68* to deslfpiate recites* W* can siaintein the non-diacrimin^toiy provisions of Article 15 ty utiliaing the reasonably direct route principle or name other that ©oiaes reasonably to hand.

Without of course in ary way comnifeting the Colonial Office, we do believe that they are generally in agreement with this view. As we have three designations currently outstanding, namely et delisbury, bulawayo and ^flying boat base at Bahrein, we should be grateful for your further views in this matter as soon as possible.

It will be noted that the views of the United Kingdom were requested by January 12th and since there was not sufficient time to consult and obtain replies from the other Government Departments concerned the accompanying comments were prepared by the Technical Department of this Ministry and were forwarded to Montreal by air mail on January 7th. I. shall, however, be glad if you will let me know at your earliest convenience whether you have any additional observations to forward in regard to the territories for which your Department is responsible* Yours sincerely, - ^ F.A.K* Harrison, Ifeq., (re Trucial Sheikdoms), Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1./ 5? COPY THE UNITED KINGDOM REPR E SENTATIVE ON THE COUN OP THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION Ref: 1460/127 TO: Ivlinistiy of Civil Aviation (S.P.3) PROM: U*K* Representative on Council 1223 Sun Life Building, MONTREAL, 2. 1 6 th 'December, 19 4 7 The Reviewing Committee completed its work on the review of the SAR standards and recommended practices, and the completed document was brought before the Air Navigation Committee on December 12th. The standards were adopted by the Air Navigation Committee, and are to be transmitted to the Council at its next session* I suggested that these standards should be tabled for a 30 —day period before adoption by Council, but this found little acceptance on the Committee, and I propose to develop this further as a general principle at the next session of the Air Navigation Committee* As a practical measure insofar as the SAR SARPS are concerned, the Council will not consider them until the middle of January, and so in fact the United Kingdom is obtaining the 30 days grace required. In ray opinion, it would be unsound tactics to press the policy of a 30—day waiting period in respect of the SAR standards* Je should, therefore, appreciate having your comments by January 12th. I am writing a recommended practices, separate letter on the policy of the review of standards and and thus rry comments here are related to this document alone* The document has not been re-written in any major degree, but an effort has been made to reduce the language to simple terras capable of translation into tne languages of the contracting States of ICAO. We have endeavoured to steer the middle course between acceptance of the wording of RSPPs as prepared by Divisions and ohe absolute perfection that is ideal* I am afraid that it is impossible to draft the SAKPs in wording suitable for immediate incorporation in national legislation without any change. The main need is to prepare clear and intelligible SARPs to give countries that really need them the standards on which to base a sound organisation. We have, of course, removed from the text the slang which had a purely military implication. An example of this is 'ditching”. We have had to define 'alerting' as this has not hitherto been a word in the original language. I think that this is a satisfactory and useful document, and hope you will not find any serious objections on grounds of policy. Should, however, you wish to enter objections, I hope that this time it will be possible to e 3 q)lain satisfactorily the reasons why the United Kingdom cannot accept a particular standard. You will not find it difficult to link the standards as contained in AN Draft 104 with the RSPPs in the final Report of the last SAR Division meeting. I have, however, some general comments. The first refers to Para. 1.5*2. tLe Rights for Search and Rescue Facilities. Here in your brief you stated that the United Kingdom had accepted this as a standard, and we were guided accordingly. This does, however, have a much wider implication- than the technicalities of search and rescue, and there has been correspondence from I.C.A. 0. to contracting States on /thisPara. 3.1.1. I think the United Kingdom objections to the application of this paragraph are amply met, and it is quite clear that your under standing of the obligations implied here and referred to in your recent letter are satisfactory. We will, of course, wish to have the comments of the United Kingdom on an acceptable effective date for these standards. Y/e attach two copies of the standards as finally amended for your consideration in advance. Copies of the final document will be sent as soon as issued.CCMIEHTS ON THE REDRAFT OF THE SAR A, IT. DRAFT 104 DATED 8/12/47 The United Kingdom comments on the redrafted SAR SARPS are* as follows; Pa^- 2 r ,. 3 . 2 . (should have been renumbered 'Para* 1 . 4 - 2 .') The principle contained in this standard is accepted by the United Kingdom and efforts are now being made to establish a suitable procedure for United KiJTgdom „ territories* in consultation with the various authorities concerned. It will be appreciated that these consultations will take some time* and therefore no guarantee can be given as to the date upon which they will be concluded and* full implementation of the standard effected. There is of course no difficulty about arranging such a procedure for Search and Rescue facilities which are of a non-military character; any difficulty must arise where military facilities are involved. Paragraph 2.1.3 » This paragraph is accepted with the observation that without a definition of tne word 'adequate' it has very little meaning. Purthermore* no explanation is offerifed as j to who will designate the areas or as to how such designation will be agreed upon. For these reasons* the United Kingdom accepts this standard with the observation that in its present form it has very little meaning and is dangerous to the extent that within such wide limits it would be equally possible either to evade the force of the standard or to suggest that non-compliance had taken place. This* in the view of the United Kingdom* is the type of standard which should be avoided. Paragraph 2.4« In accepting this standard it is desired to observe that the arrangements of rescue facilities so that they are able to arrive at the scene of distress within the shortest possible time is extremely difficult* since it must inevitably involve the prediction as to where distress is likely to occur. It is presumed that what is intended here is that Search and Rescue facilities should be so arranged that they cover main trunk routes* upon which* owing to the general flow of traffic* distress is likely to occur. If this is what is intended it seems desirable to say so* rather than to make an observation which manifestly involves prophecy. Paragraph 3 .1.1. The United Kingdom* in view of the fact that its Search and Rescue Organisation consists almost entirely of military forces on part-time duty, has in fact already complied with this standard* but finds that it cannot give all the details of its operating plan that it would desire to give. However* if that information which has already been submitted to I.C.A.0. constitutes compliance with the standard, the United Kingdom objections to this Paragraph as a Standard will be withdrawn. Paragraph 3*8*3 * The United Kingdom feels that if the contents of this paragraph remains as a recommendation, confusion is liable to be caused by its existence and* in view of the uncertainty of its status as a recommendation* little notice is liable to be taken of it by ships at sea. The United Kingdom therefore suggests that this recommendation should be deleted* since it is considered that it serves very little useful purpose in practice. Implementation of Standards The United Kingdom has implemented the majority of the standards contained in this Document v/ith the exception of Paragraph 1.5* 2. (which should be renumbered 1.4.2.) upon v/hich comment $ has been made above. With the exception of that paragraph the Standards and Recommended Practices for Search and Rescue can be implemented forthwith. A delay of 12 months is requested for implementation of para. 1.5*2.

ICAO shall also be notified.DOC 11 AN/579 2/1/48 CHAPTER 3 PROCEDURES 'i —————— 3.1 RESCUE CO-ORDINATION CENTRES 3.1.1 PLAN Each Rescue Co-ordination Centre shall prepare a complete and comprehensive operating plan for Search and Rescue operations within its area. A copy of this plan and suosequent changes shall be forwarded to ICAO. , RECOMMENDATION: The operating plan should include procedures being used, operating instructions issued, the organization of comnunication facilities and the limits of responsibilities of personnel assigned to Search and Rescue operations. This plan should also include the call signs, location of and frequencies guarded by Radio Direction Finding Stations. Note : Nothing in these Standards and Recommended Practices is intended to preclude the Rescue Co-ordination Centres of adjoining areas from making joint operational plans or agreements for mutual assistance within their areas of Search and Rescue responsibilities. 3.1.2 OPERATIONS 3.1.2.1 On receipt of information that an aircraft is in need of Search and Rescue assistance, a Rescue Co-ordination Centre shall immediately initiate action to ascertain the location of the aircraft and to provide all necessary aid. 3.1.2.2 The operating agency of any aircraft, reported to be in need of Search and Rescue assistance, shall be advised of the situation as part of the initial action by the Rescue Co-ordination Centre, and shall be kept currently informed of pertinent developments.DOC 5045 AN/579 2/1/48 - 12 - 3 . 1 . 2.3 3 . 1 . 2 .4 3.1.2.5 3 . 1 . 2.6 RECOMMENDATION: The actions of Rescue Co-ordination Centres when an aircraft is in need of Search and Rescue assistance should be to: (a) alert appropriate Rescue Units and facilities giving all pertinent facts concerning incident; (b) evaluate situation and determine whether facilities available to it can give adequate Search and Rescue assistance for the particular incident or whether additional assistance is necessary or desirable; (c) alert, as necessary, other public and private facilities, including ships at sea, which may assist in Search and Rescue; (d) initiate a message to the appropriate Rescue Co-ordination Centre assigned the responsibility of co-ordinating long range search, giving: - the pertinent facts, - what action has been taken, - an evaluation of additional assistance heeded; (e) notify the State of Registry of the aircraft in distress; (f) continue Search and Rescue assistance. Whenever a Rescue Co-ordination Centre has requested the alert or use of a Search and Rescue facility, it shall notify that facility as soon as such alert or use is no longer necessary. Rescue Co-ordination Centres, after activating Rescue Units, shall advise the appropriate accident investigating agency (see 1.5.3). RECOMMENDATION: Rescue Co-ordination Centres should have available for their areas of responsibility, a record of all visible aircraft wrecks- 13 - DOC 5045 AN/570 2/1/48 and scarred terrain which might be mistaken for an unreported or unlocated wreck. This information should be distributed to the Rescue Units concerned. 3.2 DISTRESSED AIRCRAFT CROSSING BOUNDARIES OF SEARCH AND RESCUE AREAS . 3 . 2.1 RECOMI v IENDATIONs When an aircraft in need of Search and Rescue assistance continues in flight for such time as to cross the boundary between the areas of responsibility of two Rescue Co-ordination Centres, the Rescue Co-ordination Centre from whose area the aircraft has departed should transmit immediately to the Rescue Co-ordination Centre in whose area the aircraft has entered all information necessary for the most expeditious operation of assistance. This information should facilitate the co ordination of necessary action by the Rescue Co-ordination Centre in whose area the aircraft force lands in water or makes a distress landing or when radio contact is lost. At such times as the aircraft force lands in water or makes a distress landing or when radio contact is lost, the responsibility for Search and Rescue activity lies with the Rescue Co-ordination Centre whose area the aircraft has entered. The Rescue Co-ordination Centre whose area the aircraft has left should remain alert to render Search and Rescue assistance until full responsibility for Search and Rescue assistance has been assumed by the Centre whose area has been entered. 3 . 2.2 RECOMMENDATIONS In narrow seas, where the delimitation of distinct rescue areas and the influence of national discrimination could lead to the creation of a network of small zones and to difficulties in the application of provisions under 3.2.1, the rescue areas allotted to the various coastal rescue centres may be largely overlapping and the following measures should be applieds •DOC 5045 AN/57 9 2/1/48 - 14 - 3.2.2.1 RECOMMENDATION; If an aircraft is found to be in distress above a point common to several Rescue Co-ordination Centres, each of these Centres should send out to the distressed aircraft whatever appropriate facilities it has available. 3.2.2.2 RECOMMENDATIONS The Rescue Co-ordination Centre in liaison with the Air Traffic Control which was responsible for providing any air traffic control services for the distressed aircraft should designate the Rescue Co ordination Centre which is to co-ordinate the Rescue operations. 3.2.2.3 RECOMMENDATION; That Rescue Co-ordination Centre, thus put in charge should then co-ordinate the action of all facilities supplied by the various Rescue Co-ordination Centres, irrespective of nationality. 3.3 LONG RANGE SEARCH Note: Whenever a search is conducted at a greater range than that of the available equipment, it becomes a long range search operation. RECOMMENDATION: The actions of Rescue Co-ordination Centres assigned the responsibility of co-ordinating long range search, upon receiving report of incident, should be to: (a) Evaluate the incident as reported; (b) Take no co-ordinating action if the initiating Rescue Co-ordination Centre has reported that no assistance is believed necessary; (c) T?ike co-ordinating action as in (d), (e) and (f) if the initiating Rescue Co-ordination Centre has reported additional assistance to be desirable or necessary; (d) Determine what available facility in region can best render assistance; (e) Initiate message to Rescue Co-ordination Centre or Centres which are concerned with such facilities, giving pertinent facts and type of assistance believed necessary; (f) If long range Search and Rescue is involved, designate person to be in charge at scene of incident;- 15 - DOC 5045 AN/579 2/1/48 (g) Receive and evaluate reports during and upon termination of the Search and Rescue operation. 3.4 RESCUE CO-ORDINATION SUB-CENTRES RECOMMENDATIONS Each Rescue Co-ordination Sub-Centre should co-ordinate the Search and Rescue facilities in its areas, keeping its Rescue Co-ordination Centre fully advised of all Search and Rescue matters, and in particular, the current situation during a distress incident. There should be efficient communication between each Sub-Centre and the followings its Rescue Co ordination Centre, the Search and Rescue Units in its area, and the Air Traffic Control concerned. 3.5 RESCUE ALERTING CENTRES 3.5.1 RECOMMENDATIONS The Rescue Alerting Centre should be responsible for the initiation of Search and Rescue action whenever it receives information from a reliable source that an emergency or a distress incident has occurred. 3* 5*2 RECOMMENDATION; The Rescue Alerting Centre should, immediately after receiving reliable information that an emergency or distress incident has occurred, communicate with the appropriate Rescue Co-ordination Centre, pass on the information received, state the action the Alerting Centre is taking or is about to take and give such information as the Rescue Co-ordination Centre may require to carry out its duties. 3.5.3 RECOMMENDATION; If a Rescue Alerting Centre be unable to activate adequate Search and Rescue facilities it should communicate this fact immediately to the appropriate Rescue Co-ordination Centre. 3.6 RESCUE UNITS RECOMMENDATION? Each Rescue Unit should* (a) initiate immediate Search and Rescue action when information is receivedDOC 5045 AN/579 2/1/48 - 16 - from a reliable source that any circumstances described in 1*3.1 have arisen within its area, (b) advise immediately the Rescue Co-ordination Centre of information received and action initiated, if notification is received from a source other than the Rescue Co-ordination Centre. (c) maintain the required number of rescue craft or vehicles in a state of readiness; (d) replace craft or vehicles despatched on a Search and Rescue mission, if practicable; (e) ensure by regular training that Rescue Unit personnel maintain efficiency in all phases of Search and Rescue; (f) maintain a sufficient quantity of rations and flotation, signalling, survival and rescue equipment to ensure the efficient use of rescue craft or vehicles in Search and Rescue; (g) keep the Rescue Co-ordination Centre currently informed of the number and state of readiness of Search and Rescue facilities; (h) arrange for obliterating or ..iarhin,., ail aircraft wreckage in the area upon the completion of accident investigation and advise the Rescue Co-ordination Centre of bhe location of such wreckage and the action taken. 3.7 OCEAN WEATHEU STATION VESSELS RECOMMENDATION: All aircraft flying over or within VHF range of ocean weather station vessels should establish radio contact and forward a complete position report except if a radar position report has been requested. If VHF Communication is unsatisfactory, HF may be used. However, if used, the aircraft will take care that the vessel called is clearly in the transmission in order to avoid confusion due to skip distances Note : HF is named in HF transmission.- 17 - DOC 5045 AN/579 2/1/48 3.8 CREW MEMBERS s-S.l INSTRUCTIONS FOR AN AIRCRAFT COU'ANDER OBSERVING A DISTREoS INCIDENT.

Dear Harrison, I wonder if you would be good enough to resolve a query regarding the status of the various territories with which you deal. I asked Cousins*advice as to whether any or all of them were British territory as defined in Article 2 of the Convention. You will appreciate that our representatives at I.C. A.O. are concerned not only with the U.K. as such but with all British territory, that is to say, 'the land areas ••• under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate* of H.].'.C. * Our present understanding is that the Trucial Sheikdoms are technically included under the term 'British territory 1 ^but on the other hand we understand that Bahrein and Koweit do not come within the term. Then there is the question of Muscat. I would be grateful if you could clear up this question for us so that we may know what the limits of H. G-* s responsibility to I. C. A.O. are. yours sincerely.

I understand that the exchange of NOTAMS is one of the subjects dealt with oy Mr. Hemelik and his party and I would therefore suggest that if there is no objection the I.C.A.O.

I .C.A.O , • Entitled 'Reconroendations for Standards , Practices and Procedures - .Paci1itation of International Air Transport (FAL) ^ (R.8819/45) INTRODUCTION ■article 16 This ilrticle of the Convention on International Civil Aviation relates to the right to search aircraft on landing, or departure and to inspect certificates and other documents prescribed by the Convention. It does not prescribe that aircraft may not be searched or documents inspected at any other time; but the United Kingdom /authorities wish to make it clear that they must have this right. In the United Kingdom the power in regard to ships (Section 182 of the Customs Consolidation /xt, 1876 ) is applied to aircraft by Article 23 of Schedule VIII of the Air Naviation (Consolidation) Order, 1923. 1 . DEFINITIONS 1 .4. It is suggested that the words 'as part of its normal complement * 1 ' should.be inserted in the second line after the words 'on board'. If preferred, a suitable note could be inserted in the crew manifest (Appendix l) as an alternative. In view of the practice of operating Companies, it is essential that the Immigrating Authorities should have knowledge of employees transported as members of the crew on the flight in order to take up duty and remain in this country. 1.7. It is considered that 'and' should be substituted for 'or' before the words 'Public Health'. It is essential that all three categories of the formalities in question should be carried out at a Customs Airport in the United Kingdom, not one or other of them. 1.8., 1.9., 2.9 and 12.1. If a Customs free -airport or zone should be established in the United Kingdom, it is probable that the United Kingdom Customs would have to maintain the'right to examine crew, passengers, baggage, cargo and stores within the airport or zone so as to ensure sufficient Customs control to prevent the consumption or use within the airport or zone of ceoggo and stores without payment of Customs and Excise duties and charges, and so as to sec that all relative prohibitions and restrictions were observed. It might further be necessary to have some machinery for collecting trade and passenger statistics there. 1.11 to 14. In order to protect Revenue interests, to provide for the collection of trade statistics and to prevent illegal traffic (c.g. in dangerous drugs) some Customs control would have to be exercised over the transit crows, passengers, cargo and stores excepted from these definitions. 2. GENERAL PR0VI3IQNS 2.1. It is considered that the words 'until they are accepted by the competent Authority of the Member State for examination as to their right to land' should be replaced by 'until they have been examined and granted leave to land'. /3.- 2 - 3 . 4. 5. DOCUiviSNTS 3.1 ., 5.1,1. 'Tic 1 . 5.1,3. -end appendices 1, 1A nfic 1B. Some explanation is desirable of* the intended ruothod ci use of ohe various copies of the general declaration (a) on departure and (b) on arrival and also for the clarification of the words ’’on a point to point basis' used in paragraph 3.1. It is also desirable that there should be some explanation of the difference between Appendices 1 and 1*i, to. k bee page five. In our view the Aircraft Declaration of Health, prescribed by the International Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation 1944, cannot satisfactorily be merged in a General Declaration, as contemplated in this document. Further, the form of General Declaration set out in Appendix I does not contain all the information required by that Convention, and cannot therefore be accepted by the United Kingdom nor presumably by any other State, a party to it. In particular, questions 7, 9 and 10 of the International Form are hot fully covered. 3.2 It is considered that the words 'for passengers embarking or dis embarking within a Member State' should be omitted. The remarks contained in the Note on United Kingdom viev/s on this point were 'that the passenger manifest should include an additional column for the passengers 1 occupation, that the permanent address should include both the last permanent address and a separate column showing the country of intended future permanent residence, and that a permanent address should be defined on this and other documents as a place of residence over a consecutive period of twelve months. FOKIIALITIES ON DEPARTURE A.1.4, The Customs Authorities in the United Kingdom require a list of all stores and not only of stores laden. This applies also to 57T.4. and to 'General Declaration', Appendix I. The lists .of all stores required on arrival should be in duplicate. Attention is again directed to the note in the United Kingdom views on Document 1279/FAL/32, which were as follows 'This Section can be accepted as an International Standard subject tc the following amendments Para. 1A to road: ’’Four copies bf the Gene re-1 Declaration, together with any passenger cargo manifests attached.... P-ara. 1D to read: 'If required, a list of stores in duplicate'. If these amendments are made, paras. 1 B and 1C can be omitted, as far as the U.K. is concerned.' FOP:.IALITIES ON LANDING FOP TRAFFIC PURPOSES. 5.2. The United Kingdom Customs might require a full manifest for cargo landed in transit, whether in special transit areas or otherwise. This applies also to 6,2. FORMALITIES ON LANDING FOR NON TRAFFIC PURPOSES In the note of United Kingdom views on Document 1279 it was- 3 - s * '6.if. In case such incident results in a landing elsewhere than,at designated airports, the aircraft cornmander, or person in charge of the aircraft, shall not without first making all reasonable efforts to et in touch with the public authorities concerned, allow any cargo or stores to be removed from the landing place, nor allow any crew or passengers to depart from such landing place unless such removal or departure is necessary for purposes of health, safety or'the preservation of life,' This suggested amendment /as designed to differentiate between passengers and goods, for the convenience of the former. 7. SPECIAL PROVISIONS EFFECTING AIRLIHLS 7.1. / See page five. 7.2. It is desired torepeat the remarks made in the note on United Kingdom views on Document 1279, that the U.K, will not be able to dispense with Customs entry. 7.8. A current list of crew members cannot be accepted by the Authcrities in lieu of manifest of crew for each trip as it is essential to know details of persons entering the country and also of those departing therefrom. 8. SPECIAL PASSENGER .PROVISIONS 8,2. After 'accept back', insert 'at any time after his last arrival with such non-immi rant passport from any country unless he has subsequently acquired another nationality.' In connection with Section 8 it may, on the coming into force of the Convention of International Civil Aviation, be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to make a notification to P.I.C.A. 0. in accordancewith .article 38 of the Convention calling attention to the differences between the provisions of Section 8 and the practice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the matters set forth therein. 9. SPECIAL CARGO PROVISIONS Paragraph 3. It is desired to repeat the observations made in the note of United Kingdom views on Document 1279 that the United, Kingdom will require Customs entry on both inward and outward journeys. 10. SPECIAL P UBL IC IS •xLTK PR 0 T .A SIGNS It is essential that the Public Health Authorities in the United Kingdom should have in respect of each passenger landing in this country a personal declaration of health (see specimen form m. attached) and in respect of aircraft, an aircrsift declaration of health (see speciment form B.) 10.2. While it is in our view desirable that standards of disinscctisation should be laid down, it seems to us that that this is a matter for'the consideration of the World Health Organisation after expert examination of the problem. 10,11., 10,12., The term 'endemic area' needs defining if these provisions are to be intelligible. The United Kingdom is bound (as other Governments) by the ' u existing' International Sanitary Convention and acceptable Standards etc., must therefore be in accordance with the provisions of these Conventions, A new World Health Organisation CIV.15593 / has- 4 - has now been set up by U.N.O. and it is suprested that health aspects of Civil ^..viation should be presented to a Joint Committee of P.I.ii.C.O. and the World Health Organisation. 14.3 It is observed that this paragraph has been printed as an International Standard. In the note of the United Kin, ;dom views on Document 1279 it was stated that the paragraph could be accepted temporarily as a Recommended Practice. It is desired to repeat this observation. 14.4. It is su posted that the practice obtaining in contracting states regarding charges for attendance would be ascertained by o-.I.C.^.O. and circulated for information. r • It is not understood why the columns 'Prom' and 'To' appear in the Passenger Manifest (appendix 1 (Back)) but are omitted from the Passenger Manifes t, (Appendix 1 A. (Front)) Both manifests should, it is considered, contain (b) The country of last permanent residence (c) The country of intended future permanent residence. These particulars are necessary for administrative purposes. On the actual operation of the forms (appendices 1 and 1A), two for every section of the journey, (i.e. every time the aircraft lands,) it will not be possible to.know the destination and point of embarkation of each passen ;er. Such separate manifests may in fact be intended but this point should be made clear. (2) Information about the point of embarkation -and disembarkation of each passenger could be obtained from the Passen er Manifest incorporated in the General Declaration (Appendix 1), if thet manifest were.used for all aircraft, but it seems that the separate passenger manifest will be completed in the case of large aircraft only. As the majority of aircraft in question will be large ones there seems no reason why the separate passenger manifest should ive less information than the General Declaration. Point (1) above would be covered, perhaps in a simpler way, by having the 'From' and 'To' columns incorporated in the separate passenger manifest. If this were done there would be no need to have a separate form for each section of the journey. 12 .

This provides that . . the functions of the Council shall be to . . . supervise and co-ordinate the work of . . . the Committee on Air Navigation whose functions shall be to . . . continue the preparation of technical documents, in accord ance with the recommendations of the Inter national Civil Aviation Conference approved at Chicago on December 7, 1944, and with the resulting suggestions of the member States, for attachment to the Convention on Inter national Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944.” The Interim Council of PICAO, at its eighth meeting, November 23rd, 1945, transferred customs, immigration and quarantine matters to the Air Transport Committee, and created a division on Facilitation of International Air Transport. The Council decided that the work of the Division on Facilitation of International Air Transport should be interpreted as covering all obstacles to aircraft, passengers and cargo in international air transport arising from national laws and required forms, regulations and pro cedures prescribed by governmental or other public authorities. The Council decided that the subjects coming under this definition included customs procedures and manifests, sanitary, public health or quarantine regulations, financial and monetary regulations, taxes, police and immigration requirements, military restrictions, and the regulations imposed by national or international aeronautical authorities. The distinctions, made between Standards and Practices have been governed by the following concepts: A Standard* is any requirement, procedure or practice in respect of which a high degree of international uniformity is desirable and likely to be attainable; WORD A Recommended Practice* is a desirable requirement or procedure that either cannot be adopted sufficiently widely to become general practice or cannot be adequately achieved in the actual state of technical development. When the permanent Convention on Inter national Civil Aviation is in force, the Council may adopt such standards and recommenda tions by a two-thirds vote and submit them to contracting States. Any such standards and recommendations shall become effective within three months after their submission to the contracting States, or at the end of such longer period of time as the Council may prescribe, unless in the meantime a majority of the con tracting States register their disapproval with the Council. Any State which finds it imprac ticable to comply in all respects with any approved international standard, or to bring its own regulations or practices into full accord with any International Standard after amendment of the latter, or which deems it necessary to adopt regulations or practices differing in any parti cular respect from those established by an International Standard, shall give immediate notification, to the International Civil Aviation Organization, of the differences between its own practice and that established by an Inter national Standard. In the case of amendments to International Standards, any State which does not make the appropriate amendments to its own regulations or practices shall give notice to the Council within 60 days of the adoption of the amendments to the International Standard or indicate the action which it proposes to take. In any such case, the Council shall give imme diate notification to all other States of the difference which exists between one or more features of an International Standard and the corresponding national practice of that State. *In the publication of PICAO recommendations. Standards are shown in bold-face; Recommended Practices are shown in light-face type.FAL 6 Facilitation of International Air Transport The recommendations on facilitation were first developed at four full Facilitation Division meetings, as well as at five meetings of an ad hoc Committee on Customs, five meetings of an ad hoc Committee on Immigration, and six meetings of an ad hoc Committee on Public Health, held in Montreal between January 24th and February 2nd 1946. It was open to each of the Member States to name representatives to take part in the work of the Division, and a considerable portion of PICAO’s total member ship did so. Such recommendations entitled “International Standards and Recommended Practices on Customs, Immigration, Sanitary and Related Matters Facilitating International Air Transport (February 2nd 1946)” were then transmitted to Member States for their com ments, and a number of the States furnished such comments prior to the June 15th 1946 date established by the First Interim Assembly. The recommendations in this volume are the result of revising the above-mentioned document in the light of these comments. After havii^ been considered by the Air Transport Com mittee, the recommendations contained herein were reported by that body to the Interim Council, which approved them at its third meeting of its fifth session on June 28th 1946. The recommendations presented herein are directed to Member States for their compliance with Article XIII, Section 3, of the Interim Agreement, which provides that “The member States undertake, with respect to the matters set forth in Article III, Section 6, Subsection 3, 6(1), to apply, as rapidly as possible, in their national civil aviation practices, the general recom mendations of the International Civil Aviation Conference, convened in Chicago, November 1, 1944, and such recommendations as will be made through the continuing study of the Council.” June 28th 1946.Facilitation of International Air Transport FAL 7 0 INTRODUCTION and References to the Convention on International Civil Aviation The following International Standards and Recommended Practices have been established in order to eliminate or reduce, to the extent compatible with the legitimate rights of Member States, difficulties inherent in the application to international air transport of present customs, immigration, public health and related laws and regulations. These Standards and Recommended Practices are intended to replace Annex K to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. As they are based essentially on the principles contained in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it seems appro priate to recall the Articles of the Convention related thereto: Article 10. Except in a case where, under the terms of this Convention or a special authori zation, aircraft are permitted to cross the territory of a Contracting State without landing, every aircraft which enters the territory of a Contracting State shall, if the regulations of that State so require, land at an airport designated by that State for the purpose of customs and other examination. On departure from the territory of a Contracting State, such aircraft shall depart from a similarly designated customs airport. Particulars of all designated customs airports shall be published by the State and transmitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization established under Part II of this Convention for communication to all other Contracting States. Article 13. The laws and regulations of a Contracting State as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within the territory of that State. Article 14. Each Contracting State agrees to take effective measures to prevent the spread by means of air navigation of cholera, typhus (epidemic), smallpox, yellow fever, plague, and such other communicable diseases as the Con tracting States shall from time to time decide to designate, and to that end Contracting States will keep in close consultation with the agencies concerned with international regulations relating to sanitary measures applicable to aircraft. Such consultation shall be without prejudice to the application of any existing international convention on this subject to which the Con tracting States may be parties. Article 16. The appropriate authorities of each of the Contracting States shall have the right, without unreasonable delay, to search aircraft of the other Contracting States on landing or departure, and to inspect the certi ficates and other documents prescribed by this Convention. Article 22. Each Contracting State agrees to adopt all practicable measures, through the issuance of special regulations or otherwise, to facilitate and expedite navigation by aircraft between the territories of Contracting States, and to prevent unnecessary delays to aircraft, crews, passengers and cargo, especially in the administration of the laws relating to immigra tion, quarantine, customs and clearance. Article 23. Each Contracting State under takes, so far as it may find practicable, to establish customs and immigration procedures affecting international air navigation in accord ance with the practices which may be established or recommended from time to time, pursuant to this Convention. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing the establish ment of customs-free airports. Article 24. (a) Aircraft on a flight to, from, or across the territory of another Contracting State shall be admitted temporarily free of duty, subject to the customs regulations of the State. Fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and aircraft stores on board an aircraft of a Contracting State, on arrival in theFAL 8 Facilitation of International Air Transport territory of another Contracting State and retained on board on leaving the territory of that State shall be exempt from customs duty, inspection fees or similar national or local duties and charges. This exemption shall not apply to any quantities or articles unloaded, except in accordance with the customs regula tions of the State, which may require that they shall be kept under customs supervision. Article 24. (b) Spare parts and equipment imported into the territory of a Contractii^j* State for incorporation in or use on an aircraR of another Contracting State engaged in inter national air navigation shall be admitted free of customs duty, subject to compliance with the regulations of the State concerned, which may provide that the articles shall be kept under customs supervision and control.FAL 9 ^ International Standards and Recommended Practices on Facilitation of International Air Transport (Customs, Immigration, Public Health and Related Matters) 1.—DEFINITIONS 1.1. public authorities concerned.

Mazen (France), and that relating to Visual Ground Aids at Aerodromes, by Subcommittee #2, under the Chairmanship of Mr. D.S. Robertson (Canada). Subcommittee #3, under the Chairmanship of Mr, W.M. Hargreaves (United kingdom) considered Airport Classification, Reserved Items - with the exception of certain Reserved Items specifically referred to other Subcommittees and a number of new items and miscellaneous problems, including that of Emergency Equipment at Aerodromes. On the latter question, a special Working Party composed of experts from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, was set up by Subcommittee #3, with the concurrence of the Division. All matters relating to Procedures were dealt with by Subcommittee #4, under the Chairmanship of Mr. J.F. Angier (United States). Representatives of the majority of the Delegations regularly took part in the proceedings of the four Subcommittees. 1.2. A Co-ordinating Committee composed of the Chairmen of the Subcommittees and the Chairman of the Division, arranged the work of the Subcommittees in the early stages, and later a Drafting Group was set up to assemble the material for the Final Report. 1.3. Since the time many of the Delegates were able to devote to the Session was limited, the Division had to adjourn before it had completely disposed of all the items on its Agenda. . 2. - REPORT ON THE AGEHDA 2.1. Agenda Item 1 : Study of Council Action on the Work Accomrlished by the Division at its Second Session 2.1.1. DOC 3038, containing a directive to the Division arising out of the Air Navigation Committee’s review of the Report of the Second Session (DOC 1989 )* was carefully studied by the Division and particular attention was paid to the Council's definitions for ’Standard* and ’Recommended Practice'. It was apparent that the new meanings to be attached to those terms, - meanings which differed in important respects from the concepts at the Second Session,^v/ould require extensive changes in the work done at that Session and that many difficulties would be encountered in applying them to the subjects dealt with by the AGA Division.DOC 4809 aga/558 29/10/47 PART III - 12 - 2»1.2. Standards Tor Physical Charactaristics of AGrodromes^ unlike Standards for many other subjects, are minimum Standards. This arises from the definition of a Standard (^^9 and from the nature of the requirements for physical characteristics. A Standard is by definition ’’a specification, the uniform application of which is necessary for the safety or regularity of international a ir navigation.” Now, in the case of Pnysical Characteristics of Aero dromes, Runway Dimensions, Clearances and Approach Slopes, for instance, it is a fact that the greater those dimensions, wi 'hin wide limits, and the flatter the approach slopes, the safer will be the aerodrome. A Standard for one of those^characteristics will, therefore, be the minimum specification giving an acceptable degree of safety. Furthermore, it would appear to be inadmissible,in framing a specification intended to have the status of a Standard, to make provision for anticipated future requirements,since such provision could not now be regarded as necessary for safety. 2.1.3. The Division considers, for these reasons, that the concept of a Standard, as defined in DOC 3095- is not applicable to specifications for the Physical Characteristics of Aerodromes. It appears to the Division that specifications for Physical Character istics, considerably less stringent than are generally recognized as desirable at the present time.,would result from any attempt to produce Standards as defined in DOC 3095? and that^the production of such standard specifications would be of no assistance to Member States and might even prove harmful. The Division feels, further, that such standard specifications would be quite unsuitable as a guide for the construction of aerodromes. 2.1.4. The majority of the specifications for Physical Characteristics of Aerodromes given in Section 2 of Part IV of this Report have therefore been classed as Recommended Practices. A Recommended Practice is by definition (DOC 3095) 'a specification, the uniform application of which is desirable in the interest of safety, regularity or efficiency of international air navigation.' Under this definition, the Division was enabled to draft specifi cations embodying what appeared to it to be good practice, but the fact that States were expected to 'endeavour to conform' to Recom mended Practices prevented the Division from including as such a considerable amount of material representing the best current tech nical guidance on matters which cannot at present be made the subject of firm specifications. The Division regrets that it could not give a higher status to some specifications of great importance, for. instance, Approach Slopes, than to others of less importance, for example, Taxiway Width. The Division feels also that the inter pretation placed by States on the .words 'endeavour to conform' may vary and that Recommended Practices so indecisively worded may not achieve the desired results. 2.1.5* Similar difficulties were encountered in applying the new definitions of Standard and Recommended Practice to the specifications in Section 3 (Visual Ground Aids at Aerodromes) of Part IV. In many cases a specification had to be classed as a Recommended Practice, although the Division would have preferred to give it a higher status,because neither the specification itself nor the uniform application of any particular specification could be affirmed to be necessary for safety or regularity. The effect has been to reduce many former Standards lo the class of Recommended Practices,DOC 4609 aga /558 29 / 10/47 PART III 2.2. Agenda Item 2 : Reclassification and Rearrangement of ^ Aerodrome. Air Route and Ground Aid Definitions. Standards and Recommended Practices in the light of DOC 1018. AN/l^. and the Air Navigation Committee 1 s detailed Directive to the Division 2.2.1. The' rearrangement of the Standards and Recommended Practices was carried out in the manner directed in DOC 3038. Every effort was made to separate definitive and descriptive material from the actual Standards and Recommended Practices. It was found, however, that the transfer of such material to Section 1 would in many cases render the Standards and Recommended Practices in Sections 2 and 3 incomplete and unintelligible and it was thought advisable in such cases to retain the material in the section concerned. 2.2.2. Owing to lack of time it was not found possible to revise and reclassify the material relating to Air Routes, and all such material has accordingly been excluded from the Report. The Division considers, however, that the revision of the Air Route specifications should be undertaken as early as possible and has included a recommendation to that effect in Part V. A recommendation that certain Air Route specifications contained in DOC 1989 should continue to be recognized,pending revision,is also given in Part V. 2.2.3. The Division was unable, in the time at its disposal,, to give full consideration to the specifications in DOC 1989 relating to Water Aerodromes. The specifications for the Physical Character istics of Water Aerodromes as they now appear in Section 2 of Part IV of the Report have been modified by the introduction of the new Obstruction Marking Surfaces developed for Land Aerodromes and have been adapted to. conform to the Classification System. Certain changes have also been made as a result of comments on DOC 1989 submitted by Member States and by IATA. The material in DOC 1989 relating to Visual Ground Aids at Water Aerodromes has not been revised and does not appear in the present Report. Lighting at Water Aerodromes is the subject of a recommendation for further study in Part VI. 2.2.4. A brief explanation is given in Section 1 of Part IV of the nature and scope of the Standards and Recommended Practices for the Physical Characteristics of Aerodromes contained in Section 2. In order that Section 2 may provide as complete a guide as possible to the design of new and the improvement of existing aerodromes *an effort has been made to cover the main physical characteristics, but the section does not purport to deal exhaustively with the subject. Some matters,which have not been dealt with either because of insufficient information or because the Division did not have time to consider them, form the subject of recommendations in Part V and are suggested as suitable subjects for further study in Part VI. Certain important aspects of aerodrome design, such as the layout of buildings and roads, have not and cannot be adequately treated by means of Standards and Recommended Practices,because the requirements will be different for practically every aerodrome, depending on the nature of the traffic and the site.14 DOC 4809 aga/558 29/10/4? PART III 2.3, Agenda Item 3 : Examination of Suggestions by Member State^ International Organizations, and the Secre tariat for altering the substance oT ' existing Aerodrorae and Ground Aid Definition^ Standards and Recommended Practices . J 2,3.1* The subject of'iierodrome Classification n received con siderable attention during the Session and a classification system was evolved and is set out in Section 1 of Part IV, 2.3.1.1* Briefly, the class of an aerodrome is denoted by a capital letter (A to G) indicating the basic length of the main runway, followed by a numerical index (1 to 7 ) indicating the strength of the runway. The other related characteristics are covered by the detailed specifications in Section 2 C In addition, a consolidated table, colla ting the material in abbreviated form, is Included in Section 1 for convenience of reference c 2.1,3.2. The primary purposes of the classification system are to serve as a guide in the design of new,and the improvement of existing, aerodromes and to promote uniformity in the design of aero dromes for similar types of traffic 0 The application of the system to existing aerodromes for reference purposes was also envisaged but several Delegates were impressed by the difficulties, some of which are referred to in Section 1, likely to be met with in- using it for such a purpose. 2,3.2. The comments and suggestions regarding the material in DOC 1989 submitted by Member States (DOC 4204), by the International Air Transport Association (DOCS 420p 9 4672 and 4728) and by the Secre tariat (DOCS 4202, 4206 and 4215) were duly considered, except insofar as they related to small aerodromes with runways less than 3,000 feet (900 metres) in length, to 7/ater Aerodrome Lighting and to Xir Routes, Time did not permit of the consideration of these subjects but recom mendations regarding the latter two are made in Parts V and VI of this Report, 2•4, Agenda Item 4 s Review and Classification of “Procedures ro j Air Navigation Services (Aerodromes and Ground Aids ) n . The review and reclassification of the Procedures for Aerodromes and Ground Aids was completed. Part IV, Section 4 of this Report is the result. For the sake of clarity and ease of reference it was found desirable m some cases to place exceptions to general rules in separate paragraphs, When this was done, the classification awarded to the exception was the same as if it were not separated from the general rule to which it applied. Recasting such material into a positive form was considered but the difficulties involved appeared insurmountable,as every item now used, or to be used in the future, would have had to be mentioned specifically. Agenda Item 5g Development of Technical Specifications . classified as'Reserved Items 1 in the course of action under Item 2, into' Standards or Recommended Practices . v , .None of the ‘Reserved Items* appearing in DOC 1989 has been developed into a Standard or a Recommended Practice.

'Separation of parallel ■^runways for simultaneous use under instrument conditions' is the sub ject of a recommendation in Part V. The remaining items, relating to Slipways and Docks, Water Aerodrome Lighting and Marking, and Taxiway Holding Position Lights are recommended for further study, in Part VI. 2.6. Agenda Item 6 : Drafting of Text for Headings in t he new Sections into which Aerodrom e and Ground Aid Standards and Recommen ded Practices are to be divided . 2.6.1. Action was completed as required, except under the headings 'Aerodrome Emergency Equipment' and 'Other Aerodrome Facil ities.' As already stated, a special Working Group studied the ques tion of Emergency Equipment. The report of this Group is reproduced in Part VIII and whilst considering that the time has not yet arrived for the laying down of Standards or Recommended Practices on the subject, the Division believes that the information contained in the report should be of considerable assistance to Member States. A recommendation relating to the circulation of the paper is contained in Part V. 2.?. Agenda Item 7 : Preparation of suitable arrangement , ~ and content where possible, for the new Sections into which Air Rout e Standards and Recommended Prac t ices are to be divided. 2.?.1. As already remarked in paragraph 2.2.2. above, the Division was unable to undertake the revision of the Air Route speci fications but has included two recommendations on the subject in Part V. 2.8. Agenda Item 8 : Action on such Matters arising f rom the Reports o? other Technical Meetings as are brought to the Division’s . attention/ with the primary obje ct of securing satisfactory coordination of AGA Standards and those of oth er Division s. 2.8.1. All matters arising from the reports ofother Techni cal Meetings, brought before the Division were duly considered and action taken as required. The need for close coordination between AGA Standards and those of other Divisions was always kept in mind. 2.9. Agenda Item 9: Consideration of Issues relevant to the AGA Division’s work, which have arisen f rom the work accomplished at Regional Air Navigation Meetings . 2.9.1. A new definition was developed for ’Supplementary Aerodrome 1 and has been included with the definitions in Section 1 of Part IV. The question of when visual ana non-visual aids can be dis pensed with at particular aerodromes, without sacrificing safety or regularity,was the subject of a communication from the Air Navigation^ Committee (see Part VIII) and resulted in a recommendation (see PartV.)DOC 4809 XGk/558 29/10/4? PART III - 16 - 2.10. Agenda Item 10 : Review of the list of subjects selected at the Second Session for 1 study, research * and development 1 and action on reports ^ dealing with specific items, presented by Member States. International Organi sations and the Secretariat . 2.10.1. A careful review of subjects for further study was carried out and three recommendations on this subject are included in Part VI of this Report. Special importance is attached to the inves tigation of Approach Lighting problems. 2.11. Agenda Item 11 : Selection of Items that might be Included on the Agenda for the Division 1 s Fourth Session and Suggestions of a suitable Date for Meeting . 2.11.1. A recommendation regarding the date of the next meeting of the Division and the constitution of the Agenda is made in Part V of this Report. 3. COMLlIfllCATIOhS RECEIVED FROM THE AIR NAVIGATION COMITTEE 3.1. Two communications were received from the Air Navigation Committee in the course of the Session. The text thereof is reproduced in Part VIII of this Report, together v/ith a record of the action taken by the Division. 4. RUNWAY LIMITATION 4.1.^ The Division discussed the question of 'Runway Limita tion' at its Tenth I.eeting and decided that I should convey to the Air Navigation Committee, its view that this subject is of‘great importance and that a decision on it should be reached as soon as possible. 5. RESERVATIONS BY DELEGATIONS 5.1. Attention is drawn to three Reservations entered on the subjects 01 Runway Distance Markings and Caution Zones, Runway Thieshold Lights and Clearing, Larking and Zoning of Land and Water Aerodromes. These reservations are reproduced in Part VII of this Report. 6 _. DATES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF STANDARDS 6.1. A recommendation on this subject is to be found in Part V of this Report.

Recommendations arising from suggestions made by IATA on standardization of colours of lights and surfaces and on the desira bility of Member States furnishing particulars of technical publica tions and of new aerodrome projects to the Secretariat are also sub mitted. All the recommendations included in Part V were approved as such, in the course of the Division's Session. 8 . TRANSLATION INTO FRENCH AI\D SPANISH 8.1, Frencn and Spanish translations of the more important portions of the Standards and Recommended Practices submitted in Part IV of this Report were made by members of the Drafting Group and the Secretariat following the completion of the English version of the text. 8.2. Recognizing the important influence of correct terminology on the uniform interpretation of the English, French and Spanish versions of this Report, and later of the Standards and Recommended Practices, the Division has included in Part VIII a list of some 200 technical terms in English, with their equivalents in French and Spanish. This list was produced by the Language Section of the Secretariat, and checked by the French, Belgian and Argentine Delegates. T. L.

This document (Part IV, Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4) is a guide for the design and improvement of aerodromes and it gives, by means of a series of Standards and Recommended Practices, the principal physical characteristics for aerodromes as well as basic details for the characteristics and operation of the visual ground aids. Standards and Recommended Practices, as defined by the First ICAO Assembly (*), have been prescribed in every case in which the AGA Division consider ed such a course proper in the light of present knowledge and expe rience. 1 . 1 . 2 . In the preparation of this document particular atten tion has been given toward the development of Standards and Recom mended Practices for the use of States in providing aerodromes suitable for the safe and regular operation of scheduled air traffic. However, the needs of other air traffic have also been kept in mind so that the Standards and Recommended Practices contained herein are capable of application at other aerodromes. 1 . 1 . 3 . The physical characteristics and visual aid facilities required at any aerodrome depend on the nature and volume of the air traffic v/hich it is intended to serve. This document is not intended to provide a basis for the design of any particular aerodrome. How ever, when the responsible authority has made a selection of adequate dimensions and other characteristics including the provision of facilities in a particular case, with due regard to the recommenda tions of ICAO Regional Meetings and the possibility of extension and adaptation to meet future traffic requirements, the Standards con tained herein will determine many criteria of design and the Recom mended Practices will provide additional guidance. lo2. - LAND AERODROME CL OSSIFICATION SYSTEM 1.2.1. It is considered that the needs of international air traffic now and in the future should be met by land aerodromes having basic runway lengths varying between 3^000 feet (900 metres) and approximately 8,400 feet (2,550 metres). It is further considered that the load imposed by aircraft on the runways and other pavements of these airports should range between 5*000 pounds ( 2,000 kgs.) isolated wheel load and approximately 100,000 pounds (45,000 kgs.) isolated wheel load. Traffic needs at many places will be met by aerodromes having characteristics intermediate between these extremes and it is therefore convenient to divide the range into a number of classes and to establish a classification system to identify the classes. The principal objects of the classification system are to serve as a guide in the design of new aerodromes and the improvement of existing aerodromes, to promote uniformity in the design of aerodromes for similar types of traffic, to assist ICAO and Regional Conferences in framing recommendations for the establishment of new and the improvement of existing aerodromes and to give an approximate method of describing existing and future aero dromes through the association of the two characteristics of main runway length and strength. (it) See List of Definitions- 27 - DOC 4809 AG A/558 29/10/4? PART IV Section 1 1.2.3. The classification system is intended to be used ^ chiefly in the design of new aerodromes. The appropriate authority * within the State concerned may, for example, decide from traffic and other considerations that an aerodrome of Class A1 is required at a particular place. The main runway basic length and strength would then be decided by the authority, bearing in mind the fact that the classification figures are minima, based on present day knowledge. The other related physical characteristics and requirements for the proposed Class Al aerodrome, including number, orientation and length of other required runways, runway and strip widths and slopes, clear ances, approach slopes, etc. etc., would then be selected from those given for the same class letter in the AG A. Standards and Recommended Practices. The aerodrome designer is cautioned, however, not to use this publication as his only guide but rather to interpret it in the light of most recent developments and trends in the aeronautical arts, modifying his designs, where necessary, to reflect the most recent findings in each art. 1.2.4. The classification system may be applied to existing and future aerodromes for reference and descriptive purposes, al though it is not intended for use in.air navigation. It should, however, be remembered that the classification letter and numerical index give no information about the characteristics of the aerodrome other than the basic length and estimated strength of the main runway. The 'classification' of an aerodrome cannot at present imply that the aerodrome complies in other respects with the AGA Standards and Recom mended Practices. Of particular importance in this respect are the approach slopes. It must be kept in mind that the use of an aero drome is governed by Standards of safety framed by the OPS Division of ICAO. 1.2.5. The classification letter and numerical index for an aerodrome cannot be precisely determined because there are as yet no standard methods for making runway length corrections nor for ascer taining runway strength. The appropriate letter and number must be selected by judgment and considerable latitude may be desirable in interpreting the data, particularly in the case of existing aero dromes with runways just shorter than a particular class length. 1.3. - WATER AERODROME CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM 1.3.1. The principles governing the classification of land aerodromes apply also to the classification of water aerodromes, but the classification of the latter is based on the length and depth of the main channel. Thus, the 'class' of a water aerodrome is denoted by a capital letter indicating the basic length of the main channel followed by a numerical index indicating its depth. The letters denoting the different basic channel length classes are as follows: Class Letter - A - Basic main channel length not less than 15*000 feet (4,500 metres) B - ' ' 10,000 feet (3*000 metres) C - ' ' 6,500 feet (2,000 metres)- 28 - DOC 4809 AG .4/5 58 29/10/47 PART IV Section 1 The numbers denoting the different channel depth classes are as follows: Class Number - 1 - Fain channel depth not less than 15 feet (4.5 metres) 2 - » u ii it ti u 12 feet (3.7 metres) 3 - ' n ii it m n 8 feet (2.4 metres) l.k. - SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LAND AERODROMES 1.4,1. The following tables (I and II) are provided for convenient reference to the numerical values of the principal physical characteristics required or recommended for each of the several classes of land aerodromes. The reader is, however, cautioned to use these tables for reference purposes only and to consult the pertinent para graphs of Section 2 for details as to the application and use of this information. The tables dp not include references to all of the matters concerning land aerodromes covered by Section 2.- 33 - DOC 4809 AGA/558 29/10/47 PART IV SECTION ? PHYSICA L CHARACTERISTICS OF AERODROMES ^ . 'O 2,1. LAND AERODROMES NOTE: - Land Aerodromes are treated in a number of classes as defined in Section 1, paragraph 1.2.2. Wherever the word class or the class letters A,B,C,D,E,F,G, or the class numbers 1,2,3)4 9 5 j 6 9 7 occur in this section, they have the meanings assigned to them in Section l, paragraph 1,2.2. The selection of the appropriate class of aerodrome, both as regards runway dimensions and strength, in any particular case is a matter for the appropriate authority in the State concerned. 2.1.1. Runways 2.1.1.1. General (RECOMMENDED PRACTICE). Runways should be suitably constructed and maintained to permit the safe operation of the maximum expected air traffic. Each runway should be con structed so as to be co-axial with the corresponding landing strip and to meet the requirements of this Section. In cases where grass or other natural surface may be reasonably expected to meet the requirements specified in the following paragraphs, construction of a hard-surfaced runway will not be required. The requirements concerning runways should then apply to that central part of the strip in which, in other cases, a runway would be constructed. 2.1.1.2. Orientation (RECOMMENDED PRACTICE). At all land aerodromes a sufficient number of runways should be provided and so orientated that landing and take-off operations may be made, with a surface cross wind velocity component not exceeding 13 knots, for as large a percentage of time as practicable. This percentage should be at least 95» 2.1.1.3. Length 2.1.1.3.1. Main Runv/ay (RECOMMENDED PRACTICE). The length of the main runv/ay at an aerodrome of any of the classes T A* to should be not less than the minimum basic main runway length of the^ appropriate class, together with an additional length,to oe ascertained as provided in paragraph 2.1.1.3.3., where the temperature and pressure at the site differ from standard sea level conditions and together with a further additional length in respect of j-ongi rudinal slope referred to in paragraph 2.1.1.3.4# 2.1.1,3.2. Other Runways (RECOMMENDED PRACTICE). The length of each other required runway at an aerodrome of any of the classes ‘A 1 to 'G* should be not less than 85^ of the minimum basic main runway length of the appropriate class, together with an additxona_ rengtn, to be ascertained as provided in paragraph 2.1.1.3.3©,where ^he temperature and pressure at the site differ from standard sea level conditions and together with a further additional l e ^th in respect of longitudinal slope referred to in paragraph 2.1.1.3.4. Exceptionally, however, at any aerodrome where particular wm^s o^ .^gh veloci ^y are a consideration in the determination of the required number of runways to maintain the usability factor outlined in paragraph a.1.1.^.,- 34 - DOC 4809 AGA/558 29 / 10/47 PART IV Section 2. the length of the runway or runways required to provide for such winds may be less than 85$, but should in no case be less than 70$, of the minimum basic main runway length of the appropriate class, together with an additional length,to be ascertained as provided in paragraph 2 . 1 . 1 . 3 . 3 ., where the temperature and pressure at the site differ from standard sea level conditions, and together with a further additional length in respect of longitudinal slope referred to in paragraph 2.1.1.3 *4. 2.1.1. 3 .3* Additional Length where Temperature or Pressure differ f rom Standard Sea Level Conditions fRECOI.UvlENDED PRACTICE) . The additional length of runway to be provided where the temperature and pressure at a site differ from standard sea level conditions should normally be calculated at the rate of 5$ of the basic runway length for every 1,000 ft. (300 metres) of density altitude. The density altitude of a site should be computed on the mean of the highest density altitudes occurring on each day in the hottest month of the year, averaged over a period of years. NOTE: - The hottest month is the month which has the highest average of daily maximum temperatures. This method of calculating the additional runway length, based i!? 0 ? ^ ensit y a ltitude, may prove inadequate in cases where particularly high temperature or humidity conditions occur. In such cases, the use*^ of a method ox calculation taking into account independently temper ature, pressure and humidity may prove to be more reliable.

Sight Distance (RECOMMENDED PRACTICE). For safety during take-off and landing operations, it is desirable that the greatest possible sight distance be provided on runways. : (RECOMIjiiRDED PRACTICE) , As a minimum requirement, it is recommended that runway slope changes should be such that there will be an unobstructed line of sight from any point 10 ft. (3 metres) above the runway to any other point also 10 ft 0 (3 metres) above the runway, within a distance of at least half the length of the runway. 2.1.1.5.4. ^ Distances between Slope Ch anges (RECOMMENDED PRACTICE), Excessive undulations or appreciable changes of grade located close together along any runway are undesirable. For this reason, changes in runway grades should be so located that the distance between two successive points of intersection of the extreme tangents to the transition curves will be not less than 25,000 ft. (7j50O metres) multiplied by the sum of the grade changes at these successive points of intersection. (For example, see Figure 6) 2.1„1.5.5• Transver se Slo nes ( REC OMMSNDEU PRACTICE). The transverse slopes of runways should be adequate to prevent the accumulation of water on the surface of the runway, but should not exceed 1.5$. 2.1.1.6. Strength 2.1.1.6.1.

Taxiways at an aerodrome of any of the classes 'l* to ’ 7 ' should be capable of withstanding the traffic of aircraft imposing single isolated wheel loads of the v/eight and tire pressure related to the appropriate class number (or any arrangement of wheels and tire pressures producing the same stress), for a frequency of operations on each taxiway cor responding to the maximum expected frequency of traffic of aircraft at the aerodrome producing such loads. In the design of taxiways, due consideration should be given to such operational characteristics as greater traffic density, and to the higher stresses produced by slow- moving or stationary aircraft.

Future Sessions of the Division The Division recommends that its next session be devoted to the development of Standards and Recommended Practices for air Routes which is considered to be such an important subject that its consideration cannot be deferred much longer; and that the meeting held for this purpose be convened in approximately one year’s time. It further recommends that the second next session be held to discuss Aerodrome and Ground Aid matters and that it be convened in approximately two years’ time, with the Agenda so drafted that the Division is required to perform the following tasks in the order indicated: (1) Consideration of matters on which experience was too limited in 194? for decisions to be taken. (2) Completion of Standards and Recommended Practices covering subjects on the Agenda of the previous sessions but not dealt with owing to lack of time. (3) Review of Third Session’s work, to be strictly limited to re-discussion of material that obviously requires modifica tion, either b*ecause a number of States have commented adversely on it or because changes in technique have rendered alteration necessary. It is further recommended that the items on future Agendae be more specific in character and that the scope of the Agendae be limited to those matters which can be carefully considered and completed at a session of the Division lasting not more than four weeks. 2. Future action regarding Specification of Requirement s for Visual and Non-visual Approach Aids at Aerodromes . Arising from the Seventh Meeting of the Second Session of the Air Navigation Committee, the Division received a conrunica- tion (reproduced in Part VIII) from the Secretary of the Committee, dealing with the use of the term ’’Low Visibility” • During the course of discussion, it was agreed that the following factors appeared to be applicable in considering the for Visual and Non—visual Approach Aids at any particular location: - ( 1 ) (2) (3) (4) (5) ( 6 ) Meteorological conditions in the area. The topography of the surrounding countryside. The navigational systems in use. The types of flight using the aerodrome, e.g., long-range flights will often make more stringent demands than local short-range services. # . ,, , The location of the aerodrome in relation to weather and traffic alternates. „ . . . . The adeouacy of the meteorological organization in the area surrounding the aerodrome, e.g., an aerodrome withDOC 4809 aga/558 29/10/47 PART V - 90 - 3. 4. (7) (8) (9) bad weather only one day a year can still prove dangerous if the MET reporting network in the surrounding area is such that bad weather can arrive at such short notice that incomirm flights cannot safely be diverted. Reliability of communications (air and ground). Traffic conditions, i.e., in general, instrument approach systems can be used to accelerate traffic handling at busv airports. Required regularity of operations. It was agreed that the recommendation of the COT Division, which requires the provision of such aids at all airports, was uneconomic but, in view of the scope and vagueness of the factors requiring ’ consideration before a decision as to the necessity or otherwise of installing instrument landing aids at an aerodrome could be made, the AGA Division decided that no solution to the problem was apparent at present. The Division accordingly recommpnd^ that the Air Navigation Committee give further consideration to this^matter and that, in the interim period, decisions relating to tne installation of instrument approach systems and associated visual aids should be left to the States concerned. Where possible, it would be desirable for decisions to be based on the recommendations of Regional Meetings or upon such other advice as might be obtainable. M-tlon oq Airway Obstruction Marking Specifi cations nroduced at the Second Session .

PART V 6. Technical Publications The Division recommends that ICAO request Contracting States to submit details of all technical books, reports, bulletins, etc., appearing in their countries, on the AGA sub jects selected 'for further study,' (see Part VI of this Report). Furthermore, it recommends that circulars containing the data received should be issued by ICAO to all States at quarterly intervals. 7. New Aerodrome Projects The Division considers that the Secretariat should have up-to-date information about new international and major nation al aerodrome projects, so that it is in a position, inter alia, to place Contracting States requiring information on matters regarding the layout and construction of aerodromes in touch with other States in a position to give such information. It is accordingly recommended that ICAO request Contracting States to keep the Secretariat supplied with general information about all new international and major national aerodrome projects to be undertaken in territory under their jurisdiction. 8. Introduction of the Subject of 'Aerodrome Design' into the Curricula of Technical Schools and Universities. The Division studied the following recommendation submitted by I AT A: 'That ICAO, directly and through the various Member States, encourage technical schools and universities to introduce the subject of aerodrome design into their curricula.' The conclusion was reached that the subject of the recommendation was outside the scope of a technical meeting and accordingly the Division recommends that the suggestion put forward be dealt with by the Air Navigation Committee. 9. Collection of Data Concerning the Load Bearing Capacity of Runways at International Aerodromes . The following recommendation submitted by IATA was studied by the Division and considered to be basically sound: 'That ICAO, AGA Division, collect data as to the runway load bearing capacities at various international airports and that this information be filed so as to be readily available to any interested party.' The Division recommends that the Air Navigation Committee authorize the Secretariat to follow up recommendations made in this sense by the AGA Committee at past Regional Meetings, with a view to obtaining information as to the strength of the run ways at all international aerodromes. It further reco^e^ds that all States be advised that the data submitted would be of much greater use if the method of determining the values reported, as well as any other relevant information, were forwaraed to ICAO.I DOC 4809 AG A/558 29/10/47 PART V - 92 - 10. Dates of Implementation for Standards 11 . The Division recommends that the period of time selected by the Council, in accordance with Article 90 of the Convention es that which must lapse between submission to Contracting States of the documents approved by Council, which contain the AGA Standards, and the date on which the Standards become effective be as follows: - ’ Three months for the Standards for AGA Procedures (Section 4 of Part IV) One year ior all other AGA Standards, except those concerned with Obstruction Marking (Sections 2 and 3 of Part IV, except Subsections 2.1.5., 2.2.6. and 3.4.) Two years for AGA Standards for Obstruction Marking (Subsections 2.1.5., 2.2.6. and 3.4.) The Division found it necessary to consider the dates for mplementation of the AGA Standards in three categories, because of the difficulties expected to be encountered in placing certain Standards in effect. It was decided that no difficulties other cnnnt^ e H Pr ^ ing and circulati °n of documents should be en- extension ov^r £ eS P eCt to ,. the Procedures, so that no time extension over that specified in the Convention appeared necessary. With-respect to Facilities, no difficulties ex- cept procurement of equipment were foreseen, for anything ° bstruot ion marking, so a period of one year was ^elected as reasonable.

Matters for the Attention of other Divisions ^ 12.1. Surface 7/ind Data for Aerodrome Usability Determination (MET Divis-ion^ The AGA Division has specified that there should be a sufficient number of runways at an aerodrome, so orientated as to permit use by aircraft at least 95 $ of the time, with a cross wind component not exceeding 13 knots. It is recommended that the MET Division be asked to consider standardization of a suitable method of recording and analyzing surface wind data to facilitate the calculation of aerodrome usability and the determina tion of how runways should be orientated at a new aero drome, and also to comment on the limits of accuracy obtainable in assessing usability of an aerodrome by use of this data and such methods as suggested in DOCS 4656, AG A/522, and 4703, AG A/528. The AGA Division considers it desirable that the data be presented in the following form: Wind Direction . - On at least 16 points of the compass. Wind Velocities . - Mean wind velocities at intervals as small as possible and not exceeding 4 knots, with 13 knots the upper limit of one of the increments. Frequency of Observations . - At intervals not exceeding one hour covering 24 hours a day. 12.2. Aerodrome Unserviceability Markings (RAC Division) The Division recommends that the attention of RAC Division be drawn to the new specification developed for the marking of unserviceable areas by day and the addition al specifications for the marking of unserviceable areas by night, submitted in Sections 3 and 4 of Part IV of this Report for adoption as Standards. It appears that refer ence to the relevant sections (paras. 3 .4. 3 . 1 ., 3 .4. 3 . 2 . and 4.1.1.) of AGA Standards may be necessary in certain portions of RAC Standards and Recommended Practices. 12 . 3 . Marking of Suitable Break-in Points on Aircraft (AIR Division) The Division recommends that the AIR Division be requested to study the question of marking the outside of aircraft to indicate points at which break-in can readily be effected by personnel engaged in rescue erations. This recommendation is made in support of suggestion contained in page 44 of the SAR Division's- 94 - DOC 4809 AG A/558 29/10/47 PART V 12 • 1+ * Separation of Parallel Runways (RAC, COT and OPS Divisions) The Division studied the problem of producing specific tions concerning the “separation necessary between parallel runways intended for use when visibility is poor and opera tions are being conducted mainly on instruments*’ and found information available on the procedures used to be too vague to permit production of even a Recommended Practice at the present time. It is recommended that the attention of COT OPS and RAC Divisions be invited to paragraph 2.1.1^7. i n ’ Part IV of this document, which covers “separation of parallel runways for use under visual conditions” and that their suggestions be sought as to suitable Standards for the lateral separation of aircraft landing or taking off simultaneously under instrument conditions. 12 -5* Runway Length Correction (OPS and AIR Divisions) As will be seen from paras. 2.1.1.3.3. and 2.1.1.3.4. in Section 2 of Part IV of this Report, the Division has found it impossible to produce unique specifications for “Runway Length Correction.” The subject has accordingly been included in Part VI of this Report as one “for further study, research and development.” However, the Division regards the matter as being of sufficient importance to justify a recommendation that OPS and AIR Divisions be asked to give the matter special consideration. 12 * 6- Definition of Term 'Density Altitude ' (MET and OPS Divisions) , .. Division does not consider the OPS Division's definition of 'Density Altitude' satisfactory, but has decided to adopt it as an interim measure until the OPS Division has reached a conclusion on their study of ^na! r ^ U r e K a ^°^ tablllty ' However, the Division recom - ae^s that Doth the OPS and MET Divisions be asked to note hat the density altitude at an aerodrome is considered by nt A wM?h r £h t0 . be ,' th at altitude in the standard atmosphere The dens Jt ;y is equal to that at the aerodrome.' the toli c fu n q V e f blon might be requested to reconsider foregoing opinion^ 156 !iefiri:ltion ’ in light of the IM ica tors_,fpr Air Traf fic Control (R&amp;C Division) ~ ., T1 ? e D ( J v:L f ion has Produced specifications for the tion 0 Tndfcatnr^ ra i^ iC rn C0 ?^ 01 Indicat ? rs : “ Landing Direc- and Traffic Control^ignal^a is Xis i* ^ ii th '»»' fo '' t, “ Brovisi °“ ° f tiK reauired^undpT*^PY?c??

DOC &gt;+809 AGA/558 29/10A7 PART V Requirements for Flight Conditions Light (rac Division) In the RAC Division's Final Report (DOC 2601, RAC/135), there is mention of a 'flashing amber light' and 'the necessity for reviewing this light signal in connection with the general problem of aerodrome lights.' The attention of the RAC Divi sion should be drawn to the flashing Aviation Yellow light that has been and still is the AGA Standard for Identification Beacons at Water Aerodromes 0 Possible serious confusion may therefore be set up, as the Aviation Yellow Identification Beacon will likely be mistaken for the ,, amber ,, light recom mended. In the absence of information as to the conditions under which this light is to be used, the Division has been unable to develop a specification and recommends that the RAC Division be requested to supply a more detailed statement as to the purpose of the light. The following points in particular have a bearing on the specification for such a light: (a) Is it required for use in daylight as well as at night? If so, the intensity for use by day would have to be 1000 times that required for the same conditions at night. (b) ’ In the definition of ’’Aerodrome Traffic” it is not clear what is meant by 'in the vicinity of the aerodrome.” Some indication is therefore required as to the specific distance at which, and the conditions under which, it should be visible. (c) The purpose of the light is not clear. What use, if anj/ 1 , is to be made of it by a pilot in the air? On the ground, is there any need at international aerodromes for such a light to supplement the standard Air Traffic Control radio and light signals? Introduction of the term ’‘Aerodrome Reference Point ” (OPS and 'MAP Divisions) The Division recommends that the attention of OPS and MAP Divisions be drawn to the 1'act that the AGA Division has intro duced a new term, namely 'Aerodrome Reference Point • , with the definition given in Part IV, Section 1. The Division proposes that this 'point' be used as the official geographical position of the aerodrome, it beingunderstood that if and when the aerodrome reference point is moved, the point previous y designated as aerodrome reference point shall still be as as the official geographic location of the aerodrome. power supply (RAC, MET, OPS, SAR and COM Divisions) mhs new taxt in paragraph 3.11-1* in Section 3 of Part IV has been developed to cover Emergency Power Supply at Aero- afll?

The information submitted by Contracting States should include information relative to the initiation and progress of research or developmental work of a nature similar to that indicated in the list. 2 # The Division also recommend s that the Secretariat be given the task of collecting and disseminating information or data relative to such subjects as those listed below.

The United Kingdom Delegation desires to enter a reservation in regard to the colour of runway thres hold lights specified in Section 3 of Part IV of this Report, in accordance with a majority vote of the Division at its Seventh Meeting. 1.1.2. The principal reason for the reservation is that the United Kingdom is not satisfied that the installa tion of green lights at both ends of the runway provides the most suitable method of marking its usable limits. Conse quently, the United Kingdom is not prepared to accept as a Standard the specification adopted by the Division,until experience has been gained through its use in civil opera tions o 1.1.Bo The United Kingdom are of the opinion that the use of green lights at the downwind end of the runway and red lights at the upwind end may prove to have more merit. 1.2o - 'DISTANCE MARKINGS ON RUNWAYS ' The United Kingdom Delegation desires to zone'. The two principal reasons for this reserva the smaller types of airport up to will fall within the 'caution zone- 100 - DOC 4809 AG A/558 29/10/47 PART VII is therefore allowed 0 Clearly, in the latter case the purpose of providing a caution zone is lost, since the small aircraft likely to use such airports could, in general, land within the 'caution zone' itself. 1.2.2.2. It is the opinion of the United Kingdom that the position of the runway distance markings and the length of the 'caution zone' are primarily related to questions of operation and that the recommendations of air operators, as expressed by IATA,should have received greater consideration. 1.2.3. The United Kingdom desire to reaffirm their opinion that the runway distance markers should be placed at points along the runway equivalent to two-thirds of its length measured from each end and that 'caution zones' should be provided to indicate the last one- third of the runway in each direction. 2. The following 'Reservation' was entered by the Delegate for the United States . 2.1. - 'CLEARING, MARKING AND ZONING' 2.1.1. The United States Delegation reserves its position with respect to the acceptance of the revised dimensions and locations of the obstruction marking surfaces for land and water aerodromes and the application of these surfaces as criteria for obstruction clearing and obstruction marking as contained in Subsection 2.1.5c and 2*2.6.

Where aircraft are involved in accidents on or in the vicinity ^ of the aerodrome, experience has shown that the most severe problems % in rescue operations are encountered when fire occurs* The outstand ing characteristic of aircraft crash fires is their tendency to reach lethal intensity within a very short time of the outbreak, and not only severely handicap rescue efforts, but present a severe hazard to the lives of those involved in the accidents and anyone attempting rescue. Fire is an ever present threat and occurs very frequently in aircraft accidents. Fire may occur immediately following an incident or at any time during rescue operations owing to the nature of the fuel involved, and the possibility of sparks being created through movement of the wreckage or disturbance of electric circuits. 2. The possibility of aircraft accidents is constantly present throughout the extent of air routes. The accident potential is greatest, however, at and near aerodromes. For this reason, the pro vision of special means to deal with incidents on and in the vicinity of aerodromes is of primary importance, as it is within such limits that there are the greatest opportunities of saving life. The Responsible Authority 3* The responsibility for ensuring the provision of crash, fire-fighting and rescue facilities at aerodromes should rest primarily upon the aerodrome management. Considerations affecting Measure of Protection to be Afforded 4. In deciding on the scale of equipment for crash, fire-fighting and rescue purposes, no regard should be had to the particular function for which the aircraft using that aerodrome are employed, viz., v/hether for passenger carrying, freight carrying, or other form of aerial activity. The main objective is to save the lives of passengers and crew, and it may be necessary to effect complete control or extinc tion of the fire to ensure rescue from an aircraft or any particular part of it. 5* The potential extent of the fire in an aircraft is governed mainly by the quantity of fuel carried which varies, usually, in proportion to the gross weight of the aircraft. The load-carrying capacity of the aircraft, which will set limits to the extent of the rescue facilities required at a crash, has also.a direct relationship to the gross weight of the aircraft. ^ Th ?, sca i e of crash ? fire-fighting and rescue facilities s oul , therefore, be related to the largest type of aircraft normally using the aerodrome. It is suggested s and that in increased. have to be aerodrome, other hand, require an realized, however, that the cost of providing the cales of crash fire and rescue facilities will be great the case of remote aerodromes the cost may be materially n e 4 - S ^ a i e facilities actually provided may. therefore, releted to the revenue produced by the traffic‘using the and the overall requirements of the situation. On the conditions of traffic density, or other factors, may increase m the scale of facilities to be afforded.- 103 - DOG 4309 A Q A / J J3 oo /i c\/\x.n PART VIII rj % For the purpose of assessing the scale of crash, fire-fighting 4 and rescue iacila.s-.ies to be provided at aerodromes, the following ' grading, based on the gross weights of aircraft normally or recurrently using those aerodromes, is suggested; - Grade 1: Aircraft of over 200,000 lbs 0 gross weight. Grade 2: Aircraft of 100,000 lbs, and over, but less than 200,000 lbs, gross weight. Grade 3: Aircraft of 60,000 lbs. and over, but less than 100,000 lbs, gross weight. Grade 4: Aircraft of 25,000 lbs. and over, but less . than 60,000 lbs e gross weight. Grade 5: Aircraft of 10,000 lbs. and over, but less than 25)000 lbs, gross weight. Grade 6: Aircraft less than 10,000 lbs, gross weight. Extinguishing Media 8. In view of the lack of uniformity in the size and type of the crash, fire-fighting vehicles and appliances in use ^ throughout the world, the scale of extinguishing media to be provided is most conveniently expressed in terms of volume and rate of production. 9. It is recognized that precise methods of operation, details of design, and techniques will vary with regard to cra ^’ fighting and rescue equipment. However, in °^ der J;° JL h suitable minimum estimate of extinguishing ? ed a . q purposes, it is necessary to consider certain n basic effective operation as established from actuax experience. These may be summarized as follows: - (a) Water used as water-fog, or oth ^'j s ®’ universally available cooling a £ ‘ However except nf five and for protection from heat. However, except 4«=lSl conditions, th, .xtlngnlshing .Wilt, of water on highly, inflammable liquids is poor. (b) Introduction of foam !'? t ™ a ^ r ^g S f or S such g types of fires. « s ^LTi%sr. r rin«r' -d produces .ore positive and permanent extinction. (c) Two or more compatible extinguishing agents^ ^ ln ordinarily be applied in ■ t rescU e from, and large quantity, c^^fhven relatively small aircraft control or extinction 01 , even fires, • that techniques involving (d) Actual experience indicate ^® titles 0 f a suitable rapid application ^ a A eTt gaS (such as carbon quality of foam and an ine ^ sure or dioxide (C0 2 )) suppli li superior to other known low pressure sources, t P ve results, methods for obtaining- 104 - DOC 4809 aga/558 29 / 10/47 PART VIII 10. ’ The types and quantities of extinguishing media, detailed in Appendix 1 A I hereto, are based on the experience referred to in paragraph 10, and are related to the particular requirements of civil aerodromes and aircraft. They are recommended as the minimum quantities to be held in readiness for instant operation to meet technical requirements witnout regard to economic or other factors (see paragraph 6) at each grade of aerodrome. Crash,Fire-fighting and Rescue Vehicles 11. Vehicles must be provided for conveying the extinguishing media and equipment immediately and rapidly to an accident, and, in the event of fire, for applying the media speedily and effective ly. Vehicles used for this purpose should have the following characteristics:- (a) Full 'cross-country” performance. (b) High rate of acceleration with a cruising speed of not less than 45 miles per hour, (c) Lowest possible centre of gravity compatible with adequate ground clearance. (d) Minimum unit ground load. (e) Simplicity of operation and maintenance. (f) Adequate and convenient stowage for all equipment and appliances. (g) Adequate two-way radio communication facilities as mentioned in paragraph 21. (h) Adequate lighting facilities for search and rescue operations and for illumination of the crash. (i) Overall dimensions and gross weight of vehicles should be within practical limits having regard to the necessity for passage through gates, lanes, and over bridges, and to obviate the necessity for the provision of new housing accommodation. 12. The particular nature of the terrain in the vicinity of an aerodrome may necessitate the provision of special vehicles or equipment capable of reliable movement in the operating area. For instance m certain conditions, a fast highly manoeuvrable vehicle carrying a small proportion of the extinguishing media may be of advantage for quick reserve operation. Static Water Tanks and Water Mains i?* f . i ^?, avail 5 bilit y of a sufficient quantity of water for crash 1 ire-fighting and rescue purposes, from water supply services along dpq?r^h?p C 1 S f ^ nt ° f ad ' 1 ?- nistratio n and service areas, is most nn?nft b inVh Furtherm0 r e ’ the extensi °n of such supplies to strategi points on the movement area is a great advantage, esneciallv at auantitT^q IT T h T mc d ' nslt y’ because’itens^adequat quantities of water for foam production or other uses.- 105 - DOC 4809 AGA/558 29/10/47 PART VIII Pfirsonnel cr ^ s ^ fi ^ e and rescue personnel to bring into immediate operation at least one-third of the total extinguishing media or a m n mum of one crash vehicle, whichever is the greater, should be avaixabie at all times while flight operations are in progress. At aerodromes which, from their nature or the density of their traffic, do not warrant the employment of full-time personnel, it is desirable that at least one full-time employee be provided for the proper maintenance and operation of the fire equipment provided. ij. All crash fire and rescue personnel, whether full-time or part-time, should be fully trained for the performance of their duties. They should also be proficient in medical first aid, in order to avoid the infliction of additional suffering and injury in extricating personnel from aircraft. They should participate frequently in fire and rescue drills in order to maintain a high standard of efficiency, and their training should include instruction in the layout and general structure of the aircraft with which they may have to deal, in order that on arrival at an incident they may be able to decide immediately on the best method of attack. Particfilar attention must be paid to the training and detailing for duty of the driver-operators of crash fire vehicles. Rescue Equipment 16. No attempt has been made to be specific in indicating the exact type and quantity of rescue tools and equipment to be provided. Categories and types of tools and equipment at present available are listed hereunder and these should be provided for all crash fire and rescue vehicles. Development and research may show the need for improvement and extension in the tools and equipment indicated, and further study on the development of suitable equipment should be made. Further study is also required in the use and development of power- operated tools as an aid to rescue.

PART VIII Protective Clothing !?• It is essential that adequate protective clothing and equipments be provided and maintained and be readily available to each member of a rescue crew* Such clothing and equipment should be capable of giving protection against radiant heat and limited protection against direct flame and should include gloves, helmet and a suitable face shield which must allow full vision and freedom of movement 0 Crash Fire and Rescue Station 18, The crash fire and rescue vehicles should be housed at all times in buildings (which should be heated when necessary for insuring immediate starting) and the access to the movement area should be unobstructed. The station should be in a position which is most convenient having regard to the following factorss- (a) The desirability for maintaining observation of flight activity and aircraft movement on the ground, (b) The necessity for maintaining direct communication with the air traffic control, (c) The necessity for immediate response to an alarm by auxiliary firemen forming part of the crews of fire and rescue vehicles. Dispatch of Crash Fire and Rescue Vehicles 19. The air traffic control supervisor on duty should normally be responsible for directing the movement of the crash fire and rescue vehicles to an aircraft accident, whether it be within or boundar y of the aerodrome. From his knowledge of the movements of other aircraft at the airport, the air traffic which tho U nc I T* S t , i k e +u Qualified to decide upon the extent to P rote ction on the aerodrome may be reduced for the purpose of attendance at an accident outside the aerodrome boundary.

(d) Maintaining communication by means of two-way radio with the crash fire and rescue vehicles in atten dance at an incident. (e) Summoning desired supporting assistance from services outside the aerodrome. /incidents outside Aerodrome Boundaries 22 The problem of dealing with accidents which occur beyond aerodrome boundaries must necessarily be considered in more genera- tprms The provision of easy access to the areas surrounding the boundary of the aerodrome should be given consideration by the aerc- E management, when the accident occurs at a site which is not accessible within a short space of time to the crash fire and rescue vehicles from the aerodrome, ef tn with local fire largely on the efficiency and measure of liaison local -i and g ambulance services.

The following memorandum was presented to the Division by its Chairman at the Fifth Meeting: - ' MEMORANDUM Tos Chairman, AGA Committee From: Chairman, Air Navigation Committee Date: 6 October 194/ At its Eighth Meeting, my Committee reviewed the report of the AGA Committee of the South American Regional Air Navigation Meeting (DOC SA/72 AGA/SA. 10). My Committee considered that Section 3 of the report might contain material which would be suitable for incorporation into ICAO Procedures for Air Navigation Services and might, similarly, contain material suitable for incorporation into Regional Supplementary Procedures. My Committee therefore wished me to refer to yours, Section 3 of the report and would be grateful if your Committee would report back as soon as it has examined the Section with this in mind and reached a conclusion. (Signed) Stuart Graham, Chairman, Air Navigation Committee.” 2.2. At its Tenth Meeting, the Division approved the following reply: - ' MEMORANDUM To: Chairman, Air Navigation Committee From: Chairman, AGA Division Subj ect: Section III (Procedures) of the Report of the AGA Committee „ the M S ^|}_ AmeriCan Regional Air Navigation Meeting.

Procedures at the South American Regional Meeting have been met in the Procedures which my Division will soon present to your Committee for approval, it appears that there will be no requirement for AGA Supplementary Pro cedures in the South American Region. Indeed such action would appear to be undesirable, unless similar Supplemen tary Procedures were introduced in such adjacent Regions as the South Pacific, South Atlantic and Caribbean. In the Caribbean Region at least, no Supplementary Proced ures have even been proposed for introduction. the AGA Division has studied such recommendations for the amendment of AGA Procedures as have been received from the other Regional Meetings held to date and considers that all of the concepts contained in the Regional recommendations have been incorporated in the revised AGA Procedures mentioned above and that once they are implemented there will be no need for AGA Supplementary Procedures in any of the Regions that have met to date. My Division recommends that the revised AGA Procedures as developed at the Third AGA Session be introduced as soon as possible in each Region as the initial Procedures, rather than activating the old Procedures with separate Regional Supplements, as recommended by South American (and South Atlantic) AGA Committees. By resort to this procedure, the difficulties that would be encountered in each Region in changing from one set of Procedures to another after a relatively short period of time would be obviated, and the difficulties occasioned by lack of uniformity of Procedures in Regions that actually overlap would not occur. As a result of the review, it can be stated that the concepts of the South American Regional Meeting Since all the points raised in regard to AGA In extension of your Committee's request, (Signed) Chairman, L.

The Chairman received the directive reproduced below from the Air Navigation Committee, on 30th September 194?, and presented it to the Division at the Fifth Meeting of the Session. M MEMORANDUM Tos Chairman, AGA Division From: Secretary, Air Navigation Committee The Air Navigation Committee, at its Seventh Meeting, in considering the need for a definition of the term •low visibility’, decided that all Divisions, in establishing definitions for Standards and Recommended Practices, should avoid adopting general or relative expressions to which quantitive or approximately quantitive values are to be given. The Committee considered that the term ’low visibility’ was both general and relative and was, therefore, an unsuitable one to be defined. There was no objection, however, to the use of the term in a purely general sense. The Committee further decided that the AGA Division should attempt to determine in what conditions standard visual and non-visual aids to navigation might be dispensed with without sacrifice of safety and regularity.

It is most desirable that State aircraft should be allowed to fly over the territory or territorial waters of a foreign nation, when on a rescue ffcemcjission, without let, hindrance or delay. In practice, such missions would always be co-©rdinated between the nations concerned through their respective air traffic control centres. tlon to what is proposed. The Savy are, however- affected, and I am passlhg our papers on to our Air Staff Representative • in the Admiralty with the request that he will arrange for the /dmiralty vifews to be put to you as soon as possible. 5th December, and I thick, with respect, that the Colonial Office have slightly misunderstood the nature of search and rescue operations and the procedure followed.

Because almost any aircraft is caj^blc in emergency of carrying out search operatlons # it is not the usual practice to designate special search and rescue aircraft. ^hen an accident occurs, all, available aircraft In the area, or which can reach the area quickly, are pressed into service. The point about giving special facilities to aircraft belonging to the stateglregistratlon of the aircraft to which the accident has'occurred is surely that, in the nature of things, French civil aircraft will be r^ore ready to divert themselves from their scheduled routes in'order te'go and search for a ’’Vench aircraft than, say, , British or American aircraft would be. Certainly in our case we should not be happy to leave the reepons** ' ibility for searching for a British aircraft to aircraft belonging to the country in which the accident had occurred* and in so far as the proposal will enable us to divert our own aircraft more quickly to the area of the crash, we give it full support. The same arguments apply, though perhaps with less force, to the second part of the operation, namely the actual rescub of the passengers and crew. w e therefore hope that the Colonial Office can be persuaded to modify the opposition to the I.C.A.C. proposals which is indicated in Vile f s letter.

Tne Colonial Office added a covering despatch and sent the same document to tne Colonies concerned. All these documents are included in P.W.G.2(47) 14 (revised) which I attach. One of the airfields which we expect will be joint user is Khartoum. I would be grateful therefore, if you could amend tne C.O. despatch in order to make it suitable for transmission to the Sudan and if you would send something on similar lines with the Air Ministry letter to the Sudan Authorities so as to put them generally in the picture.

GIDlLxLTi'iE 4* ;J)EN 3* HONG KONG 5* CYDRUS under consideration, in consultation with the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Civil Aviation the question of the joint use of airfields in Colonial territory by civil and ll, li.9 F. aircraft, 2, The vaiying and sore tines conflicting nature of the requirements of civil and service aircraft has in the past led to the construction of separate airfields to cater for civil and service use. There are, however, certain Colonies which by their snail extent are unable to set aside sufficient land to allow of the construction of two airfields sufficiently far apart to cater for both service and civil use. Furthermore, the cost cf the construction of airports suitable for international air traffic has risen enormously, and His Majesty’s Government are most anxious to avoid any expenditure on what could be considered a wasteful duplication of facilities required for both #ivil and service aircraft. Investigation has also shown that airfields constructed solely either for service or civil use are not likely to Tjye used to their full capacity within the foreseeable future and that it should be possible by a careful adjustment of the respective claims of both service and civil aircraft to use one airport to its maximum capacity without seriously hindering the full development of either service or civil aviation. A Civ. 12520 ,3# Doth during and after the war the Koyal Air Force continued to provide facilities required by civil aviation ^ ^ at airports in Colonial territory used by both Transport Caxiand services and Imperial trunk services operated by the three United Kingdom Corporations. You will appreciate that the Koyal Air Force cannot continue to provide these facilities because of the severe reduction in their manpower following upon the rapid demobilization of the Service, Furthermore, the maintenance by the K.^.F. of such facilities not only gave rise to political difficulties in that members of the Royal ,'i.ir Force could and did legitimately complain that their services wore being utilised for purely civil purposes, but also represented a diversion of nani;&gt;ower in the Service to ends which were not consonant with the full and proper development of the Royal Air Force in time cjf peace. As you are aware frem the deliberations of the Colonial Civil ^viation Conference (Miscellaneous No. 514), His Majesty’s Government consider that the priiaary responsibility for maintaining and operating airfield^ in the Colonial territories must rest with the Colonial administrations concerned. Similarly, insofar as any airfield owned by the Royal ^ir Force is to be used by civil aviation, His Majesty’s Government consider that the facilities required by civil aviation should, as far as possible, also be provided by the civil authority. 4. I enclose a copy of an instruction which the Air Ministry, in consultation with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Colonial Office, are sending to ^ir Officers Commanding in Chief, Overseas Commands, as the first draft of the basic principles which it is considered should govern the joint use of airfields in Colonial territory by service and civil aviation. It is hrped that these principles will form the foundation on v/hich it will be possible to work / out CIV. 12520 .out the details of integration of tcth Ii**i«F* and civil staffs and facilities at airfields open for joint use. Many problems connected with such joint use have still to be more fully worked out, and I hope to address you further on these problems in the near future. Nevertheless, I consider that in view of the imminent further reductions in R.x^F. manpower, you will wish to have this preliminary indication of the lines on which subsequent planning should proceed in order that you my bo in a position t proceed at once with-such local arrangements as you may find it possible to make with the local authorities. 5# I shall be glad to receive your observations upcn the xxir Ministry instruction, as soon as possible. 6.

(a) Joint user airfields overseas are those on v/hich facilities are provided as of right on an agreed joint 'basis for both military and civil aircrat t. Airfields at present in this category are shown in Appendix 'A'. The administration and organisation of such airfields will thus be the responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding concerned and of the local Government in whose territory the airfield is situated. It is not yet possible to deline in detail the ^iniits of the respective respon sibilities Ox the r(,A.P. and Civil Authorities concerned. It will be necessary at each airfield for Air Officers Commanding to consult with local Governments in order to carry out the general principles ‘which have been agreed, (b) At joint user airfields the R.A* P. Commanding Officer will bear complete responsibility for the discipline and administration of service personnel and, v/ithin the limits normally applicable on an R.A.F, station, of any Air Ministry civil staff and employees. The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on behalf of the local Government concerned will be the responsibility of the local Government. An officer of the local Government concorned will bo placed in charge of such civilian staff on an airfield, (c) Notwithstanding the fact that cither the Service or civilian interests on a particular airfield will alv/ays predominate, the R.A.F. Commanding Officer and the senior civil officer will each deal with their own subordinates only, so far as disciplinary enquiries and disciplinary action are concerned, except that in any cases where both Service and civilian interests may be affected a general enquiry may bo held by mutual agreement. The R.ii.P. Commanding Officer and the senior civil officer will each issue any day to da^ administrative instructions which may be required to their own subordinates. At no joint user airfield will there be any question of the direct subordination of the senior civil officer to the R.A.F. Station Commander or vice versa, but for operational convenience subordinate staff on duty may be placed in the charge of a senior officer, either civil or R.A.P. ' ’ (d) 'ii £ Majesty's Goverarjicnt arc bliged by international agree- merits to provide facilities for the lawful passage of civil aircraft, both British and foreign, on the international trunk routes. Certain local air services operated by local airlines will also use joint user airfields. It is not possible for H.M.G. to deny the use of airfields open to inter- n,,tional air traffic to interna tin- a and local airlines (except in time of national emergency, when the facilities may bo denied to all operators Gather completely or partially on a non-discriminatory basis; action in emergency vculd only be taken on instructions from, or with the specific approval of, departments in London.) It will not therefore be open to an R.A.F. Commander at a joint user airfield to issue orders precluding the use of the airfield by civil operators, British or foreign. It will bo the r-osponGibility of the local government to check the entitlement of civil operators. In the same way it will not be open to a local government to prevent the passage of Service aircraft in order to safeguard particular civil requirements. Clearance for the passage of foreign military aircraft will be co-ordinated by the Air Ministry. (o) In peace-fcirre the R.A.F. have certain strategic obligations which can only be met by keeping open a certain defined route capacity v/hich may not be required in full except under threat of emergency, but which must be kept at all times available. It nay, therefore, bo necessary at joint user airfields to formulate quotas for Service and civil use. The Service quota would take full account of strategic needs, and the civil quota would / be r 163153 .be availrblc for distribution among those civilian operators v/ho had been granted rights to operate to the airfield coneerncd. The quotas to be applied at each station would be a matter for separate discussion in each case and would, of c ursc, be subject to revision both on account of any alteration by agreement in the balance of c .vil and strategic needs and of any physical alteration to the airfield which affected its total capacity. 2. -a dministrative on:; l.nancial Principle . Ownership (a) At all joint user airfields in Colonial or British influence territory there should be separate civil and R.A.F. sites, each as self- contained as possible, -vherc the civil and Service commitments respectively should be handled. (b) On R.A.i 1 . airfields it is expected that the civil site wuld either be owned by the local government concerned cr held on long lease, e.g. fifty years. 3. Landing Fees . (a.) Local Governments will normally be responsible for collec tion f landing fees and concession rents. (b) Until local governments are in a position to take over, the R.^.F* should continue to collect fees. Works Soivicea and Maintenan ce. (a) On R.ii.-.'. airfields where there is no site owned or leased by the local government, all Works Services in connection with the landing ground and buildings (both R.A.F. and civil) will be the respon sibility of A.M.W.D. (*) Where Works Services are required by the locn.1 government on a civil site owned or leased by them, the Colonial government concerned will be responsible for arranging for the design and execution of the work. At all joint user airfields responsibility for work on the landing ground, on the R.. 11 .F. site, and on any other area outside the government owned or leased civil site will rest with A.M,W.D. (c) In those cases where work is required to be carried out on behalf of B.O.A.C., B.S.A.A. or B.B.A., due note should be taken of the principles and channels laici down m 0. a.* A28/A7 for obtaining the necessary authority. The measure of integration of fire-fighting and medical services will depend upon local conditions. Such arrangements should be settled locally. 6* T olccOi'-i.iunicati ’ns Facilities . ^ ( '•) ^i-ir movonent radio circuits (point—to—point and air/ground, land line circuits) navigation and landing aid.s, and control facilities will be used conjointly by R.A.F. one} civil aircraft, on common.air routes. (^-0 a. broad principle c^iiEion signals and control procedures will be employed on each common air route; it should be noted that in the / case G.168155 .cr'.sc nf civil aircraft control proccd’orcs can be a-lv is pry only, and not nrndatory. (c) At each a.irfiold _'nc authority, cither r civix, \/ill exorcise the overall operational control of all joint user facilities, will undertake the co-ordination of siting, technical works services, and installation of radio equipments required by the or civil aviation authorities, and will be responsible for the overall technical efficiency and operation of signals personnel and equipment. The choice of authority as between R.-u.F. and civil will in ea.ch case be settled locally. In gonera.1 the larger user will predominate, but due weight must also be given to strategic factors* (a) xis far as possible coon con user radio and control facilities will employ I.C.A.O. standards and frequencies. (e) At each joint user airfield a joint aeronautical communications traffic office will be required to deal with aeronautical traffic as classified by I.C.A.O. (f) It is desirable that I.C.^,0. procedures contained in Document Com. 126 , as modified by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for use within the U.K. , should be taught to all R.A. P. and civil operators employed on the integrated aeronautical fixed and mobile telecommunications services at joint user stations. As a long term policy adequate training in I.C.A.0. procedures will be included in the syllabuses of H.A,F, Signals draining Schools for Telegraphists and Signallers. (g) It is hoped eventually that the aeronautical fixed telecoonunica tions service will function as a separate organisation from other service and civil administrative and operational circuits at joint user stations. (h) The Air Mini try and Ministry of Civil Aviation will be respon sible in consultation with the Colonial Office and the civil administrations concerned for arranging for the provision of any additional Signals personnel required to meet any largo and sustained increase in air movements that may arise. (j) During the initial period of build-up and development it will be necessary to review the joint plan as a whole at intervals of approximately six months to take account, inter alia, of any major alterations in planned route capacity. The above constitute the main signals principles in the light of which a more detailed examination of signals requirements and procedures on the trunk r utos is proceeding. A separate and more comprehensive signals plan will bo issued at a later stage. 7. Air Traffic Control . A detailed plan for Mir Traffic Control at all joint user stations is being worked out, end will be is. ued shortly. 8. Fauronont The division of responsibility for the provision, installation, replacement and maintenance of technical equipment at joint user airfields is still under discussion. Separate x-roposals will be put forward as soon as possible. 9. Finance . No change in existing principles or current instructions is intro duced. Any special instructions about financial adjustment between the civil and military authorities as a result of joint user arrangements will be issued by denartments in London as circumstances require.APPENDIX 'A* Joint User Airfields Category 'A' Trunk Route Stations Luqa Gas tel Benito El Adem Benina Khartoum Eastleigh Changi Category 'B' Not on Trunk Routes Nicosia Khormaksar ' Kai Tak Category t C t Stations at which certain defined facilities only v/ill be retained in joint use, Sharjah Bahrein In the case of Negombo, negotiations v/ill be carried out between the Air Ministry and the Ceylon Government, and the station cannot therefore be categorised as a joint user airfield under the general Air Ministry/kinistry of Civil Aviation/Colonial Office plan.

Kef* i&lt;# 9717 m ir vn«, e hevc had an enquiry from X.C*A#0. regarding facilities for search and rescue aircraft to fly tharough the air of other states. They quote para. 4*5 of the -&gt;ro*?osed dtandards which appear in Section III of the oear^i and Reao &lt;e divisions Final Report. This paragraph reads:- r ’Contraoting states shall establish a definite Trooedure to grant innedinte entiy of aircraft, equipment and peraonrid a ith orised by the dtate of registration of an eirerr't in need of'auch^encie assistance. For the purpose of conducting aeerdh and re roue operations for etch aircraft in any area other than a prohibited area within which it nay be reasonably oonsidered that the aircraft is located, such search and rescue operations and the entry of such aircraft, equipment and personnel shall be subject to the provisions of the laws and regulations in force in the Contracting states in whose territory the aircraft is in need of search and rescue assistance.” i ara. 4#1 of the proposed Standards r&lt; fenced to above provides for the establish tent of Reao ie Co-ordination Centres by Contracting States. I understand that in practice, these oo-oruinntian Centres are the aa;ae as Ares Control Centres. I.C.A.C# is now suggerting that the Rescue Co-ordination Centres /(Area R. • • Vile, *'8q., colonial Office, Church House, Great dedth Street $ i# . 1 •I • •' ■■ ■WWW (.irea Control Ccrtrcej **101114 be a'lthoriped by their respective Govern tents to Invoke outside aid and atr^iltaneously to grant eleamriO^r^the entry or trarsit of such aid without the necessity of obtaining clerranee throi^i normal diplomntio channel*. I.C.A.G. goes on to suggest that the saving in time thus accomplished might well mean the difference between life and death to those in distress. ^ith regard to metropolitan territory, wc are inclined to favour the suggestion. Clearly, swift clearance for search and resore aircraft is a desirable thing. Overseas we of course have to consult you. Our feeling i* that the balance of advantage of the I*C.A«0. proposal would lie with us. i'or exai'ujle, sup osing one of our aircraft crashed in J gypt and we felt thr t we could provide better search and rescue aircraft then the u.gy &gt;tlans and more quickly, it might be of greet assistance to us to be able to fly such aircraft into Egyptian territory without Having to get formal clearance. I.C.A.O* haa particularly asked us to deal with this matter as one of urgency. From the humanitarian point of view this seems a reasonable request and we should therefore be glad to have your views as soon as possible. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Cary. As the majority of search and resoie aircraft will be State aircraft, the Air Ministry is clearly concerned on that score. Additionally, it occurs to us that they may be worried at the possibility of foreign aircraft obtaining entry to our air purely on the excuse thpt they are engaged on search and rescue operations when in fact they are indulging in more nefarious activities. '•&lt;e feel therefore that even in regard to G*K* metropolitan territory, we could not accept the I.C.A.O. suggestion without Air Ministry concurrence. 1 should be glad therefore, if we could heve Air Ministry consents on the proposal.Tei.

I think I must agree that it would be pointless to pursue the question of any direct payment by the Sheikiia. Sut it does not follow that we must abandon any attempt to obtain some return for the benefits which the Sheikhdoms will derive from the existence of the civil aviation facilities. Theae benefits may in fact be considerable; the direct benefit will not amount to very much at the moment (though there is the air service plus some limited scope for air travel by subjects of the oheikha ) 9 but the indirect benefits to the general economies of the Sheikhdoms through such things as the local employment of labour will certainly not be negligible* The proper course is surely to press for these benefits to be taken into account when the time comes for the renewal of the agreements with the Sheikhs and the amount of the subsidy to be paid to them is under dis** cussion. If good use is made of this argument, it may well be that, even at the present time, the subsidy can be kept down. Moreover, it may be of considerable advantage to us in the future to have got the Sheikhs into the habit of taking this sort of consideration into account; one day the benefits to the Sheikhdoms of the civil aviation facilities may be demonstrably so large that there is no case in equity for &amp; subsidy at all* I am copying this letter to Donaldson for his information.

BAHRAIN . the 21st October, 1947 ndexed Please refer to the papers forwarded with Commonwealth Relations Office endorsement No .Ex t.2168/47 “providing' dated the 13th October, 1947, about the cost ol civil control and radio staff at aerodromes in the Persian Gulf. 2. The position in the Gulf is that with considerable difficulty we have succeeded in bribing some of the Rulers to allow us to develop and maintain landing-grounds or flying- boat bases in order to establish control over air communications in this part of the world. There is a possibility that when we renew existing agreements we may have to pay more than we did before and it is out of the question to ask the States to contribute. Incidentally the States concerned derive little or no benefit from the air services which use their landing grounds or flying-boat bases. So far as I am aware there is no service which picks up and sets down passengers at Sharjah while at Bahrain there are two services between the United Kingdom and Bahrain which are reserved for oil personnel and a number of through services to the Far East and Australia which do not cater at all for local traffic. There is at present one shuttle flying-boat service per week between Bahrain and Karachi which is available to the local public but that is being taken off from the 1st November. 3. The landing ground at Kuwait is not a designated one for international use. It is maintained by the Oil Company and used chiefly for their purposes. They are providing such facilities as exist and possibly some definite undertaking might be obtained from them that they will provide civil control and radio staff if the air agreement with the Shaikh is renewed, but I do not think we can call upon the Shaikh to meet the cost of this unless he himself presses for the development of the landing-ground as a designated one and services are arranged which can be utilised by the State and its subjects. E.P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles Street, Whitehall, LONDON. S.W.l 1 LB’0 1 L mr* l considerable benefit from the operation of air services through their territories. At Bahrein the question of providing M.C.A# staff presumably only applies to the land aerodrome as it can be assumed that B.A.O.C. operate their own flying boats. No flying boats are now calling at Dubai. The Treasury suggestion would seem to mean either a substantial reduction in the small payments we make to the Sheikhs for civil air facilities or even a reversal of payments* This implies an important change of principle which would appear to mean amendment of existing agreements. If it is considered desirable to pursue the matter I suggest that this should be done at the time of negotiating fresh agreements and not before. Draft submitted,X *- DRAFT LETTER .Mills, Esq*, Ministry of Civil Aviation* OCT '547 Dear Mills, Would you please refer to your letter No*R 42104/V7/FG-2 of the 6 th October to Harrison about the cost of providing civil control and radio staff at aerodromes in the Persian Gulf? As you are aware the position at Bahrain is that in exchange for exclusive civil aviation rights we make the Sheikh a small 1 x 105 ) sum payment. Article 9 of the Bahrain Civil Aviation * Agreement allows H.M.G. or their agents to retain all landing fees 'in recognition of H.M*G- , s expenditure on the aerodrome and of the consideration paid to the Sheikh under clause 16'. In our view the Sheikh has already made a a reasonable contribution towards the cost of running the aerodromes in his territories, by agreeing to forego landing fees. I am unable to see how we could ask him to go further than /thisthis, and even to reverse the understanding on which the Agreement is based vwhich is that we pay for our privileged position^ without negotiating a fresh agreement. This we v_ . *J iO^Tv- w ,.&gt;-r . V ‘ * * - certainly da not wish to do, especially as the existing Agreement has over a year to run. In the case of Sharjah, in return for facilities for the operation of services by % v'.*' - ozzo l or .i i zix B.OJL.C., we pay the Sheikh a small personal subsidy together with rent for the air station and rest house, and a landing fee of Rs.5 for * • • every aircraft landing on the aerodrome. In our view it would be wrong to approach the Sheikh for any change in the working of the present agreement before its expiry merely on the grounds that our own arrangements had undergone a change. The Sharjah agreement is due for renewal in July next year and if any change (such as the retention of landing fees by in recognition of the /costcost of maintaining and staffing the aerodrome^ is contemplated we feel that this should await ^ negotiation* ftd? a fresh agreement*Tel.

In effect this has meant that the civil authorities concerned have undertaken to provide civil control and aeradio staff to take over from the R.A.F# the facilities which they were operating during the war and have continued to operate for R.A.F. and civil purposes up to the present. Whereas in some colonies the local government has been able to assume responsibility for the provision of the civil staff, there are certain stations, including those in the Persian Gulf area, where M.C.A. has had to take direct responsibility for the provision of the necessary civil staff. This has been done, in most cases, through the agency of either B.O.A.C/'oA International Aeradio Ltd. (a Company formed by the three British Airways Corporations to take over, where appropriate, the operation of civil aviation ground servicesj The expenditure involved will be a direct charge on M.C.A. Votes and we haa therefore to obtain the Treasury's approval to our proposals. Whilst they were prepared to agree that there was no alternative method of providing the necessary technical staff, they have suggested that in the case of the Persian Gulf Stations, we should discuss with you the possibility of recovering some part of tr.e cost from the local Sheikhs. This suggestion is based on the F.A.K.Harrison Esq.*» Commonwealth Relations Offio®* Whitehall, S.W.l .. ./assumptionG.R. - 2 - &lt;£ij i.UO assumption, derived from the Chicago Convention, that each Government should provide the ground facilities required in its territory for international air navigation* This assumption h&amp;s«4&gt;«en accepted in the case of the Colonies and we are now dii* issing with the Colonial governments the division of the cost of providing trunk route facilities in their territories between local and U,K. funds* We are not in a position to say how much benefit the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Sharjah obtain from the operation of British trunk route services through their territories, nor how much it would be reasonable to ask them to contribute towards the cost* We must, therefore, seek you advice on whether we can expect any contribution from them, before replying to the Treasury^ We do appreciate, however, that as we have to pay for the privilege of operating aerodromes in these territories our chances of obtaining any contributions from the Sheikhs must be very small even if it can be established that they derive considerable benefit from the operation of the services* Yours sincerely.r Tel.

Meeting of the Provisioneil International Civil Aviation Organization held on Monday, 24th June 1946. Invitations to the Middle Eastern Meeting 71* The President suggested, in view of the approaching end of the session* that the Council take fonnal action on invitations to the Middle Eastern meeting, . 72. Colonel Verhaegen . referring to the discussion at the previous meeting, stated that Belgium would like to be included in the list of invited States. 73* Sir Frederick Bowhill asked that action on Muscat- Qman be held over until he had received a reply frcm his Government. He then moved That invitations to participate in the Middle Eastern Regional Air Navigation Meeting be extended to the following States: Afghanist an Australia Belgium Egypt Ethiopia Prance Greece India Iran Iraq Lebanon Netherlands Saudi Arabia Sweden Switzerland Syria Transjordan Turkey Union of South Africa United Kingdom United States Yemen and to the following International Organizations: International Air Transport Association (lATA) International Commission for Air Navigation (ICAN) International Meteorological Organization (IMO) International Telecoranunications Union flTU} Federation Aeronautique Internationale (pAl) 74/ MD/ •* f Extract frora the Minutes of the 10th Meeting of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization Interim Council held on Wednesday, 5th June, 1946. Agenda Item 3: Consideration of plans for the P1CA0 Middle Eastern Regional Air Navigation Meeting 12. The President recalled that at its previous meeting the Council had agreed that the views of the various national delegations to the Assembly would be sought before action was taken on the scheduling of particular regional meetings. The present case, however, had been under consideration for some time and it seemed desirable to reach a decision without further delay. The latter part of September or the early part of October had been suggested. While this would involve a conflict with the demonstrations and meeting of the COT Division, he thought it unlikely that the experts concerned with conanuni cat ions in the Middle East would be the same as those who would represent their Governments at a meeting concerned with the choice of new types of radio aids to air navigation. i 13* Mohamed Roushdv Bey stated that the Egyptian authorities considered October 1 as a suitable date for the convening of the Middle East regional meeting, but, if this would conflict with the dates fixed for the COT Division, they would have no objection to postponement until November. He pointed out that the meeting, if convened on October 1, should conclude by October 29, since IATA was scheduled to meet in Cairo on that date. 14* Cmdr. Smith, in reply to a query on the probable duration of future regional air navigation meetings, thought that three weeks would be ample now, when the pattern for these meetings has been set and considerable procedural experience gained. He recalled, however, that the suggestion had been made at Paris that the technical committees might be staggered instead of being held at the same time. /15.-..t foerztt 15. The President remarked that if the Paris recommendation was accepted, it might be rather more convenient, since it had been suggested that the Comnunications Committee should be the last to meet, its work being affected so much by the conclusions reached by the other committees. Some states might send more experts to the United Kingdom demonstrations than to the United States and some of this additional group might go on to the Middle Eastern meeting. If there were any staggering of meetings, there would be ample time between the end of the United Kingdom demonstrations and the opening of the COM work in Egypt. Mohamed Roushdv Bey, in the absence of further discussion,/ moved that October 1 be fixed as the opening date of the Middle / ^ East Regional Air Navigation meeting. I 17* Dr. Alvarado seconded the motion, which was carried i unanimously. * * 18. Mr. MoComb. on the general question of scheduling regional meetings, reported that the Australian Government felt that the most appropriate date for the South Pacific meeting would be some time during the first quarter of 1947 . They would not like to see the meeting held any later than that. On the other hand, 1946 would be too early.Extract from MEOTES OF THE FIRST MEETING OF PROVISIONAL INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION held on 17th June, 1946 Agenda Item 2: Consideration of Plans.

Mr. McComb requested that Australia be added to the list, since she intends to operate an air service from Sydney to London via the Middle East area* 26.

Colonel Wang indicated that the Chinese Government intended to send observers. 1 28.

We consulted the Foreign Office regarding Transjordan and the Yemen, but I find that in respect of the Trucial Sheikhs we replied on our own initiative that their external relations were conducted entirely through H.M.G*, and that they could not be invited to attend the Conference in any capacity«.G.R. Sir yrederick Bowhill has now signalled to enquire whether Muscat and Oman are in the same category as the Trucial Sheikhs, and I am writing this letter to ask for ^*our advice on this point. . If they are full sovereign states there would presumably be no objection to their being invited to the Conference in their own right though they might possibly not wish to attend, but if their foreign relations are conducted through this would presumably be inappropriate and their interests, if any, would have to oe looked after by the British representative.

AGREEMENT RELATING TO AIR TRANSPORT BETWEEN BRITISH AND FRENCH TERRITORIES. The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, considering that the possibilities of civil aviation as a means of transport have been considerably increased, that it is desirable to organise regular international air services in a reliable and orderly manner and to promote international co-operation in the greatest possible measure in this field, and considering that the previous Agreements concluded between the two countries regarding the operation of regular air services should be superseded by a more general Agreement adapted to suit the altered circumstances of air transport, have appointed their representatives who being duly authorised to this effect have agreed as follows: — Article I. Each contracting party grants to the other contracting party the rights specified in the Annex to this Agreement for the purpose of the establish ment of the air services therein described. These services may be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. Article II. (a) Each of the services specified in the Annex may be put into opera tion as soon as the contracting party to whom the rights specified in the Annex have been granted has designated an airline or airlines to operate the specified routes. (b) The airline or airlines thus designated by one of the contracting parties may be required to satisfy the competent aeronautical authorities of the other contracting party that they are qualified, both technically and commercially, under the laws and regulations in force in that country, before being permitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement. Article III. (a) Each of the contracting parties agrees that the charges imposed on the designated airline or airlines of the other contracting party for the use of airports and other facilities shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into aircraft in the territory of one contracting party by, or on behalf of an airline designated8 by the other contracting party and intended solely for use by the aircraft of the other contracting party shall be accorded, with respect to customs duties, inspection fees or other charges imposed by the former contracting party, treatment not less favourable than that granted to national airlines or the airline of the most favoured nation. (c) All aircraft operated by the airline or airlines designated by one Attracting party on the routes covered by the present Agreement and supplies of fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, normal equipment and aircraft stores retained on board aircraft of the designated airline or airlines of one contracting party shall be exempt, on entry into or departure from the territory of the other contracting party, from customs duties, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used by such aircraft on flights in that territory. Article IV. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognised as valid by the other contracting party for the purpose of operating the services specified in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognise, for the purpose of flight above its own territory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. Article V. (a) The laws and regulations of one contracting party relating to entry into or departure from its own territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall apply to aircraft of the designated airline or airlines of the other contracting party. (b) Passengers, crews and consignors of freight shall be required in the territory of either contracting party to comply, either in person or through the intermediary of a third person acting in their name and on their account, with the laws and regulations governing the entry into, the presence in and the departure from that country of passengers, crews or freight, such as the regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs and quarantine. Article VI. Each contracting party reserves the right to withhold a certificate or permit to operate from an airline of another State, or to revoke it, in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of the other party to this Agreement, or in case of failure by an airline to comply with the laws and regulations referred to in Article V, or to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement. Article VII. The two contracting parties agree to appoint a Standing Joint Com mittee to co-ordinate their respective air services and, where necessary, to submit for the approval of the competent aeronautical authorities of the two countries proposals for the modification of the Annex of this Agreement. This Committee shall be composed of two representatives of the competent aeronautical authorities of each of the contracting parties and of two representatives of the airlines of each of the two countries. The Committee shall meet alternately in London and Paris under the chair manship of one of the representatives of the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party in whose territory the meeting is held.4 Article VIII. (a) The contracting parties agree to submit to arbitration any dispute relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement or of the Annex thereto which cannot be settled by direct negotiation. (b) Any such dispute shall be referred to the Council of the Inter national Civil Aviation Organisation set up by the Convention on Intp^t national Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944,( 1 ) pending the entry into force of the said Convention as between the two contracting parties, to the Interim Council set up by the Interim Agree ment on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the same date.( 2 ) (c) Nevertheless, the contracting parties may, by mutual agreement, settle the dispute by referring it either to an Arbitral Tribunal or to any person or body that they may designate. (d) The contracting parties undertake to comply with the decision given. Article IX. If both contracting parties ratify a general multilateral Air Convention, or adhere to it, the present Agreement or its Annex shall be amended so as to conform with the provisions of the said Convention from the date of its entry into force as between them. Article X. The present Agreement shall supersede all previous Anglo-French Agreements on air transport, notably those of the /th August, 1929, and the 12th August, 1937. Article XI. This Agreement and all contracts connected therewith shall be registered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation set up by the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944. Article XII. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of signature. If either of the contracting parties considers it desirable to modify any provision or provisions of the Annex to this Agreement, such modification may be made by direct agreement between the competent aeronautical authorities of both contracting parties. Either contracting party may at any time give notice to the other contracting party that it desires to terminate this Agreement. Such notice shall take effect twelve months after the date of the receipt of the notice by the other contracting party, unless the notice to terminate is withdrawn by agreement before the expiry of this period.

(б) The Government of the United Kingdom is prepared to grant the facilities desired by your Government at Hong Kong on the route between Paris and Tokyo, and at Singapore on the route between Saigon and the Society Islands, as specified in Part B of Schedule I of the Annex to the Agreement, subject to the conclusion of an agreement between your Govern ment and the Governments of India and Australia, respectively, concerning facilities in the territories of those Governments. Facilities in Burma on these routes are subject to the concurrence of the Government of Burma. (c) The grant of the facilities desired by your Government in Bermuda on the route specified in Part B of Schedule I of the Annex to the Agree ment is subject to the consent of the Government of the United States in accordance with an Agreement between that Government and the Govern ment of the United Kingdom. ( 3 ) (d) The Government of the United Kingdom is considering proposals for the establishment in due course of an air service between Canada-San Francisco-Honolulu-Canton Island-Fiji-Noumea-Australia and New Zea land, and it is proposed that the question of facilities in French territories for this service should form the subject of future negotiations.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 28th February, 1946, in which you state: — In the course of the negotiations which led up to the conclusion of the Agreement relating to air transport between French and British territory of to-day’s date, the two Delegations have reached agreement on the following points: — (1) It will be among the functions of the Standing Joint Committee set up by Article VII of the Agreement to complete the list of Colonial air routes of regional or local interest affecting the Colonial territories of the two countries and to examine how far and on what routes or parts of a route it will be possible for each of the two countries to renounce, on a reciprocal basis, the privilege of cabotage normally reserved to its national airlines. The two Delegations have noted their agreement in principle on the great advantage which such reciprocal renunciation would have from the point of view of the users and from that of the economic operation of the services. (2) It has become clear that, stated in general terms, the application of principles of the division of capacity and of the conclusion of agreements between companies on the common stages of the routes operated in Europe by the airlines of the two countries would be difficult, but that this procedure is to be recommended in application of the principles stated in paragraph 5 of the Annex within the framework of European routes. (3) It has been agreed that paragraph 5 (d) (2) of the Annex authorised the airlines of each of the two countries to operate their trunk routes on the basis of a minimum frequency to be determined by the Standing Joint Committee set up by Article VII of the Agreement, and that, in particular, on the French trunk route to Indo-China, this frequency shall be six services a week. I have the honour to inform your Excellency that these arrangements have the full agreement of the Government of'the United Kingdom. I avail, &amp;c.

Dear Ratcliffe-Cousins, I enclose a copy of an Express Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding flights by aircraft of 'Air Prance', over ihe Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. 2. My attehtion has been drawn in this connection to the Agree ment of 28th February, 1946, with the French Government, Schedules 1(B) and IIl(B) of which provide for landings in Bahrein, while Schedule IIl(A) provides for direct flights betv/een Iraq and India. I have also seen a copy of the French Embassy’s note of the 11th June stating that 'Air France' are putting into operation from 18th June the route provided for in Schedule l(B) and that the Company is making an exploratory flight commencing 11th June on the route Paris-Cairo-Basra-Delhi- Calcutta-Saigon, You will, however, observe from the Political Resident’s letter that 'Air France' were already making regular landings on the Sharjah aerodrome before 30th May. 3. In the circumstances it.may be considered desirable that enquiries should be made from the French Government about the landings reported in the Political Resident's Express Letter.. It will also be necessary for the Political Resident to notify the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhs (including presumably Qatar) about the air services (including if possible information about the frequency) referred to in the Schedules to the Air Agreement with the French Government referred to above. Can we be assured that the Flights will not pass over Koweit territory? As regards flights across Muscat territory we agree v/ith the Political Resident that it should be left to the French Government to make any approach to the Sultan direct. 4.

Political Agent, Bahrain, reports that Dakota aircraft of u Air France' are making regular landings on the aerodrome and are flying over the Trucial Shaikhdoms . It is not known whether the aircraft fly over Kuwait or Baarain territory or the tip of Kusandam peninsula in Muscat territory. ^ 2. Under Article I Agreement, Air France, as of the International air Services Transit a scheduled international air service,can s ervice / claim the privilege of flying across the territory of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms or of landing in it for non-traffic purposes. Under Article 6 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, however, this privilege cannot be exercised except with the sp-ecial permission or other authorization of the State concerned, in the present case His Majesty’s Government acting on behalf of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms. Ho intimation has been received that such permission has been sought or accorded, and it is requested that the position may kindly be elucidated. 3. In negotiations recently successfully concluded for the extension of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement (on which a separate report is being made) the Ruler of Bahrain requested that he should be given previous notice before any foreign air service commenced to operate through Bahrain. If aircraft of 'Air France' fly across his territory he should be informed accordingly. The Ruler of Kuwait and the Trucial Coast Rulers have not made a similar request but it is desirable that, as in the case of flights by Trans continental and Western Airways, they also should be notified. 4. Muscat is not covered by His Majesty’s Government’s sig nature of the Chicago Agreements. If aircraft of 'Air France' do in fact fly across Muscat territory the position requires to be regularised by obtaining the Sultan’s permission. In view of i his reaction to the approach made by His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the United States Government in respect of similar flight: by Trans-Continental and Western Airways (cf. Residency Printed Letter Ho .C/131, dated the 21st May 1946) it seems preferable that ncn government should approach him direct. {Signature) Sd. W.R.HAY.

G. to contract engagencnts on behalf of the jirab Sheikhdoms of the Persian G-ul i i n Intornaticnal iiffleemencs Note by External Dept, India Office fhe question of H.iuG's right to spoalc on behalf of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (Koweit, Sabrem, ^atar and the frucial Sheikhdoms) in international agreements has recently come to the fore in connection with (l) the Chicago ^ir Agreements, (2) the recent Petroleum Agreement between the U.K. and U.o. Governments and (j) the fret ton ,oogs Agreements. The standard definiti n of the status of those uheikhdoiis is 'independent iirab States under British protection out not British Protectorates 1 '. a. The C h icago Air Agreements . In considering the briefs for thu U.K. and Indian delegationsat CMcago it was thought desi.able that the oheikhdoiis should be brought within the terms of the draft U.K. Air Convention in order tiiat traffic between the oheikhdoris and other U.K. territories should be reserved to the U.K. as cabotage'. This was coaoiaered co oe efiectod by Beet ion 2 of .article Ylii of tlie Interim ji.greminent as signed, since this Section defined the territory of a ctate as including’territory under protection' ana the sheikhdoms are territories under British protection. Thei'e was no list of protected fcorriGoi’ies, etc., attached to the Chicago Agreements. It has since como to light thr.t there are certain inconsistencies between the Cnicago .rir jigreemencs and our C-'-Vxl ..viation .agreements with Balrein and ji.oweic, as ootli the la tier agreoi onts prov^oo that H. o. G. shall not gran c tnc use oi aerodromes ,to foreign aircraft without the consent of the oheikh, and that aircraft shall not fly over', or l-.nd in, tlie sheikh's terrioo o.gs except under special authorisation issued by the oheikh. On the oKier hand, in the Chicago 'Two IT’cedoiis' Agreement (international Air Services Transit Agreement) each signatory Kate has granted the ocher contracting states the privilege of flying across and landing for non-trail ic purposes in 'its cer itoi’ics' and the definition of 'territory' in Section 2 of Article VIII of tlie Interim Agreement as including 'Kerricory under protection' is ap licable to tlx. Tv/o, IToxdot.is Agreement. 3. A note on the implications involved was recorded by oir Geoffrey Prior and will be found below (Annex l). The fact remains that the U.K. signature at Chicago was given to agreements which specifically and in terms axiplied to all territories under the Sovfdeignlty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of the contracting Governments. The sheikhdoms aro unquestionably under our protection for international purposes and therefore the U.K. signature did cover them. bo fax as h, . G*s own relations with the bheikhdons are conc erned, it may not have oeen coxrect for u.M.G. to sign agreements covering the Sheikhdoms without consulting them, Revert oless i« is certain that, internationally, the U.K. is committed in respect of the sheikhdoms, as territories under H. ..G's protection, and it is therefore neces arv to i iiici some v^ay ox getting the bheiichs to fulfil^ ths obligations of the Chicago agreements which the U.K. signed. The Political R. sident stated in his tclegraii. Wo, 1/74 of 2nd Decor,ibeig 1945, tnat he was proposing to take action to this end, 4. Article VII of the Pecroleui agreemen t between the U.xv, and U. o. Governments states that the signatory Governments agree -- 2 - (a) That the gonoral purpose of t. is ^groonont is to facilitate the orderly deVelopnuiit of the international potrolcuia trade and tlr.t no provisioi\ in this Agreement, uith the exception of iirticle II, is to be construed as applying* to th~ operation of the d ones tic petroleum inc.ustry yithin the country of either Government; (b) That nothing in this P.grouncnt shall be construed as impairing or modifying any lay or regulation, or the right (S- to inact any lay or regulation, relatiip, to the importation, of pcftroleum into the country of either Government; (c) -That for the purposes of this Article the word 'country 1 shn.il mean: (i) in relation to the Government of the United lelngdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the tfnited hingdoi ,’tr.oso British Colonies, o erseas territories, protectorates, protected states and all mandated territories administered by that Government lists of uhich as at the date of this Agreement have been exchanged.' It yill be seen that the definition of country applied only to Article VII of the Agreement. The lists uhich yore exchanged did no. include the Arab Bhoikhdoma. The Petroleum agreement is a general declaration of intention and it.uould liave made no practical difference if they had been so included, except that it uould then have been possible to hold that the oxl trade betuoon the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms and the U.K, or other British territory uas domestic trade, and to that extent the activit-es of the International Petroleum Commission in regard to the international Petroleum trade might have been impaired. 5* as regal’ ds the Brett on Poods Agreements , the sign .tory governments, under Article ■pCSoction 2(g) of the No not ary Pund iigreement and Article XI Section 2(g) of the International Bark Agreement, undertook to accept the Agree, .ones both on their oun beliali and in respect of all colonies, etc,, inclu ding all territories under thei r protection. In point of fact the obligations ucrc not such that they were likely to be of any practical effect so far as the .Sheikhdoms uere concerned, and H.i .G,, in thu instrument of signature deposited uith the U. B. Government, felt entitled to declare that they had taken ' : all steps necessary to carry out all of its obligations under the said Agreement', in spite of the fact that the Gheikhs had not boon consulted by them. 6. The implications involved are much the same as in the case of the Chicago Air Agreements, It has however been considered sufficient in this case Dimply to inform the mulmrs that K.P.G. have accepted certain obligations under the Bratton Woods Agree rents which will have effect in their territory. 7. The general conclusion seems to be that if we are going to maintain the position taat the Arab pheikhdo. is of the Persian Gulf (excluding 1 uscat) are British protected states and can have no international /relations fL A ■ ifrelations with other states except through H.Ii. G&gt;, then wo must from time to time undertake international obligations on their bclialx, and must see, es a domestic matter between ourselves and the Sheikhdoms, that the latter fuliijy^ those obligations so far as i&gt;j required* India Office, G.'.i. 1.

I submit that there is no foundation for tills view. 3» I will take the states in detail. Pirst, as regards the Truoial ahaikhs - the view is pr.su .ably based on the exclusive treaties of the 6th : arch, 1392, Those treaties, however do^noi, cede u,: ary authority to gran; concessions to foreigners without x eic-j.encc to che x^ulers, and the Shaildis would certainty not interpret t . e S. a ^ 00rnents in this The rulc ^s are, of course, well awafe rightSs and recalled that wo had the greatest diluculty in securing our own origin .1 air rights for ourselves. 1 ■iho Civil Air agreements with Sharjah and Dubai give us no support as tnoy are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B.O.A.C. . p.-^uin. Here again our position is presumably based on the exclusive Treaties of the 22nd December, 1880, and the 13th march, 1892. These treaties however are purely negative. The ohaikh binds himself noo to enter into any agreement with foreign powers, but he does not glVU carte blanche to act for him and in the past he has always been consuloed in advance \^he.c his interests were afiected. In addition •the Civil Air Agreement expressly provides that we will not allow foreign aircraft to use Bahrain aerodrome without the ohaikh* consent, and this completely estops any claim on our part. Kuwait. Here the exclusive treaty of 1899 is less emphatic than that of Bahrain and the Shaikh is not precluded from correspondence with foreign powers. His Civil Air Agreement is equally definite and precludes us from allowing foreign aircraft to use thm aerodrome or aerodromes without the shaikhs consent. In other words the oliaikh expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) the ,owor to peridc foreign aircraft to use his mtato. 1* case of I xl. cat i understand that it has been accepted that the Sultan is not bound by the Chicago agreement and the question of □ringing him into che picture is being pursued separately, 7. where we give advance intimation of our requirements to Gulf states, nuke it clear to then that their interests are being safeguarded, and take care no^ co oifend their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to oouain our requirements without difficulty, if tills is not done the n u lcal 0 ^^ acer * 3 ’ basi ' : 18 sundered immeasurably ‘ more difficult and a molehi..! may easily turn into a mountain.

They replace everything that has previously been said with regard to this matter. r. .- s'i 1. Prom the international point of view the Indian States are “'''part of India. If a convention or agreement, whether in heads of states or governmental form, is accepted in respect of India without any qualification the States are covered by it. 2. If any action has to be taken to exclude the States frem the operation of a convention, whether such action takes the fonn of a reservation inserted above the signature or the form of an excluding notice under the colonial article, such action will be taken by the plenipotentiary signing for India or in the form of a notice put in at the instance of the Government of India, whether the convention is in the heads of states or governmental form. Similarly, if the States are excluded from the operation of a convention by reason of the terms of the colonial article and it is desired to give a notice under the colonial article bringing the States in, the action will be taken at the instance of the Government of India. t 3 . * If the Government of the U.K. are parties to any inter national agreement, and the Government of India are not, care must be taken to see that the agreement is not by its terms automatically applicable to 'territories under suzerainty', , ( since this term covers the Indian states and is used solely because of the Indian states. 4. On the other hand if the Government of the U.K. becomes a party to an international agreement in which it may be open to the Government of India to participate at a later date. /thethe subsequent participation of India may be facilitated if there is a colonial article under which it is optional to include or exclude territories under suzerainty, and consequently the U.K. will be assisting the Government of India if in an appropriate case they obtain the insertion of a colonial article referring inter alia to territories under suzerainty* c * 5* Colonial articles have in the past been in two forms (a) Articles making the convention applicable to 'colonies territories under suzerainty or mandate' automatically r unless action is taken to exclude them, and (b) articles which only make the convention applicable to such territories if positive action is taken to include them* It will be necessary in future to insist on form (b) because otherwise if the U.K. to re a party and India were not the Indian native states might be held to be covered unless action was taken to exclude them and only the U«K* could take that action, which would be contrary to 2 or 3 above* Further, if India later became a party, India might want to put in a notice including the States which had been excluded by U*K* # action* 6* * Colonial articles have in the past been so expressed as to imply that territories under suzerainty were under the suzerainty of the contracting Goverxment which was accepting or disclaiming obligations on their behalf* For the future, however, it is desired to avoid any form of words which contains the implication '- that the Indian States are under the suzerainty oi^wording of the Colonial article will have to be re-modelled so that the phrase 'territories under suzerainty' is not related to the contracting Govemnent but stands alone, leaving it to be assuned that the suzerain is not any Government but the person of the Sovereign* The following formula would be appropriate:- /'Its / the Government of India; and for this purpose the customaryM Its colonies and overseas territories, territories under its protection or mandate, and territories under suzerainty. 1 *MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION, Tel. No. HOLBORN 3434, Ext. R. 5806/45/C. 0.1. Dear Harrison, v* Thank you for your letter of 12th December (Ext.6439/45) e .losing copies of Telegrams Nos. 1774 and 1775 from the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf. I am sorry we had not sent you ere this our comments on Donaldsons letter to Gallop of 22nd November, of which you sent us a copy. We do, however, confirm that the views set out in the 3rd paragraph of our letter of 18th August remain unchanged. This point has now been fully elucidated in paras. 5 and 6 of the India Office note, and the proposals which the Political Resident now proposes to put before the Sheikhs will if accepted remove any possible shadow of doubt. We endorse these proposals so far as this Ministry is concerned. We agree generally with the Political Resident’s proposals in Telegram No. 1774 of 2nd December, and also with his proposed amendments to the Bahrein and Koweit Agreements, subject to the following comments in regard to the suggested amendments to the Regulations:- , . Artiie 1. Deletion agreed. Article 2. We suggest deletion of the phrases 'so authorised” and tt in the authorisation”, which still leaves the words ”as may be specified” in the text. If we take out the whole of the phrase !’as may be specified in the authorisations' it seems to us that the sentence is left somewhat hanging in the a /Form of Street, P.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, King Charles S.W.l.We agree deletion. Articles 8 and 9. These need no amendment until the Chioago Regulations are substituted for I.C.A.N. Regulations. We suggest, however, for clarity’s sake that the words ''as amended from time to time' should be added at the end of Regulation 8 . As far as we can see from consideration of the Civil Air Agreements and the Schedules attached thereto, no other amendments are necessary to bring them into line with the Chicago Agreements. As regards para.3 of your letter, we agree so far as our information goes, that your estimate of the position in respect of Saudi Arabia is correct. Events there, however, are moving so we suggest you should keep in touch with the Foreign Office in that connection as they will be fully posted with regard to developments in that quarter.V?; &amp; n z &gt; r 18 1A i - JLV I I ' V (W 15770/1287/802) ^ indexed 946 Z/Jjh^lM ^- FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 22nd December, *^^ 5 # 1 2 O ‘TJ Z!

In the absence of* Gallop, who is ?H^^ n Bermuda, I am replying to your letter Ext. _5 575/45 of 22nd No vember, forwarding a copy of a note prepared in your department on* the 'Right of His Majesty s Government to contract engagements on behalf of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf in International Agreements'. 2. In paragraphs 5 and 6 of this note jl'ou refer to Foreign Office letter E 647/4/91 of 12th February 1935 and conclude that although internationally speaking we are 'able' to include the Sheikhdoms as territories covered by the United Kingdom signature ’th® Chicago civil aviation agreements, they are not automatically included thereunder. I am afraid we must differ from this conclusion. The United Kingdom signature at Chicago was given to agreements which specifically and in terms applied to all territories under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of the contracting governments. The Sheikdoms + are unquestionably under our suzerainty*and/or protection for international purposes, and so our signature did cover them. In other words we duly exercised our io include them and did in fact do so (though we quite appreciate the fact that purely as between ourselves and them we perhaps ought not to have done so without previous consultation). /3.

I should also mention the fact that the foreign Office letter under discussion was really concerned solely with the status of the Sheikhdoms for the purposes of the interpretation of an Act of Parliament of the United to their position internationally, which is what we are \ concerned with in the case of the Chicago agreements# 4. As implied above, we are inclined to think that * the view expressed by Sir Geoffrey Prior in his note of 27th September is very probably correct in principle# i#e. that it may not really have been consistent with the, so to speak, constitutional position prevailing between us and the Sheikdoms for us to have signed agreements covering them without having previously consulted them. Never-the-less it is in our opinion quite certain that internationally the United Kingdom is committed (rightly or wrongly) in respect of the Sheikhdoms, as territories under our protection, and that we must find some way of getting them to fulfil the &lt; obligations of the Chicago agreements which we signed. 5. We are accordingly glad to see from Bustonre telegram No. 1774 of 2nd December to your department that Sir Geoffrey Prior is already proposing action to ensure that the Sheikhdoms can in fact be treated in the same way as British territory for civil aviation purposes. 6 . As regards paragraph 5 of Sir Geoffrey Prior*s telegram, we do not think that American moves in Saudi Arabia need be regarded as affecting this question.

V/e are interested to have this. Prom the oil point of view I have no comments to make, except that I think the last sentence of paragraiph3 of your note needs to be read in the light of the following. The Anglo-American Oil Agreement is, it is true, a general declaration of Anglo-American intentions on international petroleum trade, but in certain respects it is not quite true to say that it would make no practical difference whether the Arab Sheikhdoms were included by the definition of country in Article VII or not. It is correct, as you say, that the Arab Sheikhdoms were not included in the list of territories covered by this definition. If they had been, the effect would be to bring the Arab Sheikhdoms within the protection of Article VII(b) (which I suggest should also be quoted in the text of your note)providing 'that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as impairing or modifying any law or regulation, or the right to enact any law or regulation, relating to the importation of petroleum into the country of either Government'. The Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms would, conse quently, have come within the domestic fence on the British side and it could probably have been maintained that oil trade between the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms and the U.K. or*other British territories covered by the definition of country was domestic trade and not international petroleum trade, and, to /thatthat extent, the activities of the International Petrole\iDi-^ Gommission in their reviews of and recommendations for ti, regulation of international petroleum trade might have been impaired. This, at any rate, was the American fear accentuated by their interest in the principle of equal opportunity etc. for oil development in the luidale i^ast. By the exclusion of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms from the definition of country, the Anglo-American Agreement does not specifically provide for the reservation of their rights to regulate their imports of oil; this would have been the case if they had been included in the definition of country, but I am not sure whether you would regard this as making any practical difference to the points you havein mind in drafting your note.

's right to speak on behalf of the fjlkt x. Arab Sheikhdoms (Kovdtit, Bahrein^and Trucial Sheikhdoms) in regard. W international agreements has recently come to the fore in connection with (l) the Chicago Air Agreements, and (2) the recent h Petroleum Agreement between the U.K. and U.S. Government^ The standard definition of the status of these Sheikhdoms is ' independent Arab States under British protectior^but n,oJ^ British Protectorate s.V The Chicago Air Agreements . In considering the briefs itfgQLiSLyE for the U.K. and Indian delegations/it was thought desirable that the Sheikhdoms should be brought within the terms of the* Air Conventior in order that traffic between the Sheikhdoms and other U.K. territories should be reserved to the U.K. as cabotage.

We must first of all be clear whether we wish to claim that, for the purpose of the Chicago Agreements, the Persian Gulf States (other than Muscat) are under our protection. Our file attached, and especially flags X, Y and Z, showj clearly that the view has hitherto been taken by the ^ppartments concerned (including the Foreign Office) that it is not only desirable but possible* In particular ttte will enable us to claim that traffic between the U.K.^figt British Colonies etc. and these States is cabotage and may, therefore, be reserved. If we are going to claim this and other rights we shall, of course, have to carry certain obligations, but the papers on this file suggest that thiaf will not be unduly burdensome. The alternative will be, of course, to regard these states (like Muscat) as foreign for this purpose, in which case we shall have no rights under the Chicago Agreements. We should still be in a position to advise the Rulers to follow courses that suit us. If the Rulers/ ■Rulers do what we want there may, I suppose, in any case be a certain amount of criticism from the foreign governments who suffer; but I should be inclined to think that the criticism would be less if the States were formally claimed as under protection than if they are wholly foreign and quite unbound by the Chicago Agreements# In the latter event, however, we as* sVs«»X^ ^ free of all formal obligations* 3 .If the view of the interested Apartments is that it is on balance desirable that the Persian Gulf states should be regarded as bound by the British signature of the Chicago Agreements, then I suggest that we want to be sure that vis-a-vis 0 foreign governments, (a) we are in principle in order 4m claiming treaty#.making powers in respect of tJjejs (b) that from the v. 'municipal' point of view we are in a position, vis-a-vis the Rulers themselves, to exercise these powers* As regards (a) . notwithstanding the views expressed by the F.O. on question you will remember that doubt was thrown on our treaty-making powers in connection with the conclusion of the Anglo-American Oil Agreement and that in the absence of time to examine this question, it was decided not to treat the Persian Gulf states as/as 'under protection' for the purposes of that Agreement. It seems very desirable to get the question of principle cleared up with the Foreign Office once and for all. If we have not the powers then there is nothing more to be said. If we have, then we have to consider whether we are in a position to exercise them in this case. I gather that Sir G-. Prior considers that we should have been, provided the Rulers had been consulted in advance. As they were not consulted it will remain to be (Ur* ^ *■ PTTn whether the omission can now be rectified. ^ If you accept the views expressed above it would seem somewhat premature to consider your question about the designation of airports. Your question will not arise unless and until it is clearly established that the Persian Gulf states have been bound by the Chicago Agreements.- p * -V' PILE COPY GO^RNtpT OP INDIA ^Sxternal A pair p j^r tmeint \ irr&gt; *; n.--&gt; t him To aiKHBS l.ttt ;rt.

In the case of Sharjah and Dubai, the agreements are in the form tha-4 the British Government desiring to establish air stations in these territories, the Ruler grants the B.O.A.C. certain facilities. In the case of Kalba, the agreement is in similar form though there is no mention of the B.O.A.C. In none of these three cases is it specifically stated that the agreement is an exclusive one. We should be glad to have your comments in the light of the Chicago Agreement. ^ ^ M cv&gt;i* /£ dr/’F fa. ± M*. Secretary, Sxternal Department . The recommendation of the Chicago Conference which the Government of India have in mind is one which runs as follows / That'That each State undertake to refrain from including specific provision in an agreement which grants exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop and commercial entry to any other State or airlines or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can he taken under presently out standing agreements.' This is designed to prevent Government A entering into an agreement with Government B under v/hich the airlines of Government A would have in the territory of Government B the rights specified and laying down at the same time specifically that the aircraft of the countries of third parties will positively net have these rights. I have not had time to go through the air agreements with the Arab States, hut I imagine that all that they provide is that British airlines will have certain rights and that they are silent on the question of whether such rights should he accorded to the airlines of other countries. If that is so I do not think that the Chicago recommendation touches them in any way. By virtue of HMG’s control over the foreign relations of the Arab States it is of course open to us to advise those States not to grant to foreign airlines the same rights as they have granted to our airlines. This would not he contrary to the letter of the Chicago recommendation as I read it. Whether it would he practicable from the political point of view v/ould probably depend / onon the circumstances in each case. I think that you ought to get the comments of the Civil Aviation Ministry and of the Foreign Office.J 3 cret, External Airairs Department. To iderit . stan Gulf,. No * F. Ill (3j -PGA/ 45 .

It remains to consider the position in the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms.

Sxt» 2215/45 oi 1ST June, 1945 Dear Jones, /ith reference to my letter No. iixt.1626/45 of 13th April recording the question of civil air facilities in Muscat I enclose jated 24th Terowitha ccpy of a letter from the Government of India in which they suggest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf might be authorised to enter into negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat with a view to obtaining the Government of India* s own post-war requirements in connection with civil aviation. You may remember that seme time ago the Sultan expressed the wish that he might be informed as far as possible in advance of British post-war civil aviation plans for the South Arabian route, and he was assured that he would be given full time for the examination of any proposition which H.M.G. might have to make (see Political Resident* s telegram T/89 of 12th March and India Office telegram 6533 of 23rd March of which spare copies are enclosed,) The Muscat Civil Air Agreement which lapsed in 1938 was between H.M.G. and the Sultan and in the special circumstances of Muscat you may think it desirable for H.M.G 1 s requirements in civil aviation matters to be put to the Sultan at the same time as those of the Government of India... We should therefore be glad to know whether you are in a position to give a sufficient indication of this to enable the Political Resident to enter into negotiations for an agreement. Whether such an agreement should this time be made jointly in the names of H.M.G. and the Government of India is a matter requiring further consideration. The Government of Inaia are of course for civil aviation purposes novv a separate international person. . Would you please also let us have your comments on the detailed/ Major H.

INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES TRANSIT AGREEMENT International Air Services Transit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix III. INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT International Air Transport Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix IV. The following resolutions and recommendations were adopted: • I PREPARATION OF THE FINAL ACT The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Secretariat be authorized to prepare the Final Act in accordance with the suggestions proposed by the Secretary-General in Journal No. 34, December 4, 1944, and that the Co-ordinating Committee review the text; 1 hat the Final Act contain the definitive texts of the instruments formulated by the Conference in plenary session, and that no changes be made therein at the Final Plenary Session. II DRAFT TECHNICAL ANNEXES Whereas : . largest possible degree of international standardization of practice in ( ^ nan ^ rnatters is important to safe, expeditious, and easy air navigation; Whereas : These matters typically involve problems of great variety and complexity, and require that much new ground be explored; and Whereas : Considerable progress has been made, during the discussions of the present Conference, in the development of codes of practice agreed upon as proper by the technicians participating in the discussions, but the time has been too limited, and the number of personnel able to participate directly too small, to permit carrying the discussions to final conviction of the adequacy or correctness of certain of the determinations here made;P) See note on page 1. ' ' The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the drafts of annexes for an international civil aviation convention, which are attached hereto as Appendix V^ 1 ) be accepted by the Conference, upon the bases that: (а) The drafts as now presented shall be accepted by the participating States for immediate and continuing study; ( б ) They shall be accepted as constituting models of the desirable scope and arrangement of the several annexes; (c) The participating States undertake to forward to the Government of the United States (or to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization if it shall in the meantime have been established), by May i, 1945» any recommendations which they may have for necessary additions, deletions, or amendments; (d) The Government of the United States (or the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization) will transmit such suggestions to the other participating States in anticipation of meetings of the technical committees to be established by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza tion for dealing with the subject matter of the various documents, such meetings to be held as soon as practicable thereafter for the purpose of ultimate acceptance of the annexes in final form for attachment to a convention. (e) Meanwhile, in so far as the Technical Subcommittees have been able to agree on recommended practices, the States of the world, bearing in mind their present international obligations, are urged to accept these practices as ones toward which the national practices of the several States should be directed as far and as rapidly as may prove practicable. III TECHNICAL PERSONNEL Whereas : The development and maintenance of suitable international standards in matters relating to international air navigation will require constant analysis, by technically qualified personnel, of the development of the pertinent arts and of the various practices existing with respect thereto; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, as soon as possible after its organization, should employ in its Secretariat a suitable body of personnel, expert in the fields of aeronautical science and practice in which continuing study will be particularly needed; and that such technically qualified members of the Secretariat should be charged to analyze and report to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization on problems relating to the drafting of international standards and recommended practices and to conduct and report on such other studies as will promote the safe and efficient conduct of international air transportation. IV METRIC SYSTEM Whereas : A standard system of measurements in all rules and regulations pertaining to air traffic on international and intercontinental airways would greatly con tribute to the safety of these operations; and14 Whereas : It is considered of high importance that figures used in rules and regulations and other data, with which air crews and other operational personnel have to deal in the preparation of and during flights over various countries, should consist of round figures which can easily be remembered; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: 1. That in those cases in which it appears impracticable or undesirable to make use of the metric system as a primary international standard, units in publications and codes of practice directly affecting international air navi gation should be expressed both in the metric and English systems; and 2. That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization shall make further unification of numbering and systems of dimensioning and specification of dimensions used in connection with international air navigation the subject of continuing study and recommendation. Considering : That the sale of aircraft to be used in international operations will render it desirable for the various governments to reach a common understanding on the legal questions involved in the transfer of title: The International Civil Aviation Conference That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the early calling of an international confer ence on private international air law for the purpose of adopting a convention ‘ dealing with the transfer of title to aircraft and that such private air law conference include in the bases of discussions: (a) The existing draft convention relating to mortgages, other real securi ties, and aerial privileges; and (b) The existing draft convention on the ownership of aircraft and the aeronautic register, both of which were adopted by the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA) in 1931. ROME CONVENTION (MAY 29, 1933) ( 2 ) RELATING TO THE PRECAUTIONARY ATTACHMENT OF AIRCRAFT Considering : That the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce is essential in order that the fullest advantage may be derived from the rapid means of communication afforded by aircraft; That the seizure or detention of aircraft where the attaching creditor cannot invoke a judgment and execution obtained beforehand in the ordinary course of procedure, or an equivalent right of execution, affects the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce; The International Civil Aviation Conference ( 2 ) 'League of Nations Treaty Series ” No. 4479 (not ratified by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom). V TRANSFER OF TITLE TO AIRCRAFT Recommends : VI15 Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of ratifying or adhering to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Precautionary Attachment of Aircraft, signed at Rome on May 29, 1933, during the Third International Conference on Private Air Law, in so far as such governments have not already ratified or adhered to that Convention. VII RESUMPTION OF AND CO-ORDINATION WITH THE SESSIONS OF CITEJA Considering : That the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA), created pursuant to a recommendation adopted at the First Inter national Conference on Private Air Law held at Paris in 1925, has made considerable progress in the development of a code of private international air law through the preparation of draft international conventions for final adoption at periodic international conferences on private air law; That the further elaboration of this code of private international air law through the completion of pending CITEJA projects and the initiation or new studies in the field of private air law will contribute materially to the development of international civil aviation: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of bringing about the resumption at the earliest possible date of the CITEJA sessions which were suspended because of the outbreak of war, of making necessary con tributions toward the expenses of the Secretariat of CITEJA, and of appoints ing legal experts to attend the CITEJA meetings; and 2. That consideration also be given by the various governments to the desirability of co-ordinating the activities of CITEJA with those of the Pro visional International Civil Aviation Organzation and, after it shall have come into existence, of the permanent International Civil Aviation Organiza tion established pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7th, I 944 - VIII STANDARD FORM OF AGREEMENT FOR PROVISIONAL AIR ROUTES Whereas : The course of military events will free certain areas of the world from the interruption which the war has caused to civil air traffic; Whereas : The civil transport systems and facilities of many States have been reduced to a level which is far from adequate, but on the other hand there exist wide opportunities for utilizing the airplane, which has demonstrated its efficiency in rendering rapid transportation on a large scale basis, in bringing aid to needy countries and in hastening the return of normal trade and commerce, J Ac 41235 5i6 Whereas : The possibilities of air transportation are so great and at the same time so unpredictable, that it is desirable to promote early development in this field during a transitional period, in order to obtain practical experience for giving effect to more permanent arrangements at a later date; Whereas : Every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory; and Whereas : It is desirable that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services; The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That each State undertake to refrain from including specific provisions in an agreement which grant exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop, and commercial entry to any other State or airline, or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State, and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can be taken under presently outstanding agreements; 2. That the clauses contained in the draft form of standard agreement hereinafter set out shall be regarded as standard clauses for incorporation in the agreements referred to above, it being understood that the right is reserved to the States concerned to effect such changes of wording as may be necessary in the particular case and to add additional clauses so long as such changes or additions are not inconsistent with the standard clauses, it being further understood that nothing herein shall prevent any State from entering into agreements with airlines of other States provided that such agreements shall incorporate the aforementioned standard clauses to the extent that these may be applicable: Form of Standard Agreement for Provisional Air Routes (1) The contracting parties grant the rights specified in the Annex* hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted.

Have accordingly concluded this Convention to that end. PART I—AIR NAVIGATION CHAPTER I General Principles and Application of the Convention Article i Sovereignty. The contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. Article 2 Territory. For the purposes of this Convention the territory of a State shall be deemed to be the land areas and territorial waters adjacent thereto under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of such State. Article 3 Civil and State aircraft. (a) This Convention shall be applicable only to civil aircraft, and shall not be applicable to State aircraft. (b) Aircraft used in military, customs and police services shall be deemed to be State aircraft. (c) No State aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms thereof. (d) The contracting States undertake, when issuing regulations for their State aircraft, that they will have due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft. Article 4 Misuse of civil aviation. Each contracting State agrees not to use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of this CQtvvcntion.CHAPTER II Flight over Territory of Contracting States Article 5 Right of non-scheduled flight. Each contracting State agrees that all aircraft of the other contracting States, being aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air services shall have the right, subject to the observance of the terms of this Convention, to make flights into or in transit non-stop across its territory and to make stops for non-traffic purposes without the necessity of obtaining prior per mission, and subject to the right of the State flown over to require landing. Each contracting State nevertheless reserves the right, for reasons of safety of flight, to require aircraft desiring to proceed over regions which are inaccessible or without adequate air navigation facilities to follow prescribed routes, or to obtain special permission for such flights. Such aircraft, if engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail for remuneration or hire on other than scheduled international air services, shall also, subject to the provisions of Article 7, have the privilege of taking on or discharging passengers, cargo, or mail, subject to the right of any State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider desirable. Article 6 Scheduled air services. No scheduled international air service may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State, except with the special permission or other authorization of that State, and in accordance with the terms of such permission or authorization.

Each contracting State undertakes not to enter into any arrangements which specifically grant any such privilege on an exclusive basis to any other State or an airline of any other State, and not to obtain any such exclusive privilege from any other State. Article 8 Pilotless aircraft. No aircraft capable of being flown without a pilot shall be flown without a pilot over the territory of a contracting State without special authorization by that State and in accordance with the terms of such authorization. Each contracting State undertakes to insure that the flight of such aircraft without a pilot in regions open to civil aircraft shall be so controlled as to obviate danger to civil aircraft. Article 9 Prohibited areas. (a) Each contracting State may, for reasons of military necessity or public safety, restrict or prohibit uniformly the aircraft of other States from flying over certain areas of its territory, provided that no distinction in this respect is made between the aircraft of the State whose territory is involved, engagedin international scheduled airline services, and the aircraft of the other con tracting States likewise engaged. Such prohibited areas shall be of reasonable extent and location so as not to interfere unnecessarily with air navigation. Descriptions of such prohibited areas in the territory of a contracting State, as well as any subsequent alterations therein, shall be communicated as soon as possible to the other contracting States and to the International Civil Aviation Organization. (6) Each contracting State reserves also the right, in exceptional circum stances or during a period of emergency, or in the interest of public safety, and with immediate effect, temporarily to restrict or prohibit flying over the whole or any part of its territory, on condition that such restriction or pro hibition shall be applicable without distinction of nationality to aircraft of all other States. (c) Each contracting State, under such regulations as it may prescribe, may require any aircraft entering the areas contemplated in sub-paragraphs (a) or (b) above to effect a landing as soon as practicable thereafter at some desig nated airport within its territory. Article 10 Landing at customs airport.

Article 12 Rules of the air. Each contracting State undertakes to adopt measures to insure that every aircraft flying over or manoeuvring within its territory and that every aircraft carrying its nationality mark, wherever such aircraft may be, shall comply with the rules and regulations relating to the flight and manoeuvre of aircraft there in force. Each contracting State undertakes to keep its own regulations in these respects uniform, to the greatest possible extent, with those established from time to time under this Convention. Over the high seas, the rules in force shall be those established under this Convention. Each contracting State undertakes to insure the prosecution of all persons violating the regula tions applicable.36 Article 13 Entry and clearance regulations.
