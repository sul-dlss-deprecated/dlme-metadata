The proposed Levy is to be commanded, armed, paid and equipped through British or Indian officers. The primary object for the proposed Levy Corps is to enable the withdrawal of the Indian troops at present garrisoning in the towns of Muscat and Matrah and the regular troops at Bait el-Falaj [Bayt al-Falaj], and to replace them with a locally raised force sufficient to assert the Sultan’s authority and defend his capital against rebellious tribesmen.British Officials discussed the importance of obtaining an undertaking from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman not to arrange any treaties with foreign powers without the agreement of His Majesty’s Government. They also discussed the export of arms by the Sultan and the conditions of the arms traffic convention.The file includes copies of proclamations issued by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman regarding the establishment of an armed force of artillery and infantry to be recruited from the coastal towns in the immediate neighbourhood of Muscat, mainly, Matrah, Riyam, Kalbu, Sidab, and Mutairah. The proclamations include the law of enrolment in the local Levy Corps. The correspondence in the file also includes copies of a 'Scheme with Estimates for Raising and Maintaining a Levy Corps for Muscat' prepared by the Political Agent, Muscat.The main correspondents in the file are: the Political Agent, Muscat; the Political Resident, Bushire; the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department; and the Inspector General, Imperial Service Troops, Simla.Most of the correspondence in the file is dated 1913-1921 apart from folio 241 which is a note page dated 12 February 1935.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
