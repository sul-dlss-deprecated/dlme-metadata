Q^V 12th February 1947. * yir No.4161/D/35• The Consul General for Iran in India, The Hon f ble Member Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, Government of India, New Delhi. Sir I have the honour to refer to my letter No.3077/I)/35 &lt;r z ^ : m &gt; ) fir f- \ H i dated the 16th November 1946 and to state that although I had requested the Government of India to take such steps as would safeguard the life and property of Iranian nationals in Bombay, unfortunately nothing has so far been done in that connection which in turn, it has transpired, has resulted in further losses aggregating to five killed and more than five lacs of property looted, and none can say when this state of affairs will come to an end. These brutal happenings have caused grave anxiety tc my Government and to the Iranian nationals living in Bombay, and in the absence of any information in regard to the steps which the Government of India should have taken to end this unfortunate lawlessness', my Government are naturally under the impression that the appropriate authorities of the Government of India are sitting idle over the situation and are doing noting to extend protection of the lives and property of my countrymen in this country and that miscreants and mischief-mongers, altkough in most cases they are aware that their victims are the nationals of a friendly neighbouring country who have no say and no hand in the current disturbances in this country, do not abstain from attacking and stabbling these ^peace-loving innocent persons, a number of them fatally, and looting their property. It is surmised that these attacks on Iranian nationals* lives and property were not totally accidental and unexpected but in several cases they were pre-planned and th&lt; rioterfs had even threatened the victims of violence. Under the circumstances and according to very plain instructions from my Government, I once again have the honour to-- 2 • to Invite your personal attention and reiterate my request that very effective measures should be adopted to control this abnormal state of affiara and to safeguard the lives and interests of Iranian nationals living in Bombay. Of course| this is not my business and I shall probably be overstepping the bounds if I dare suggest what measures the Government of India should adopt and what means they should employ to curb these happenings, as they themselves are the best Judge of what they should do, but I think a few hints might do some good to the Iranian nationals in the affected areas. In the first instance, the Bombay Government should publicise expressing regret through the local press, posters and radio the said incidents that have befallen the Iranians in the said localities adding that these Iranians have always cherished friendly feelings for the Indian people in their entity and they hrve nothing to do with and have no interest at all in the commwnal tension and dlssentlons, and that it will be doing them gross injustice if these nationals, who are really guests of the pop people of India, should thus be killed end their property ravaged, ©specially when the principal activities of a majority of them centre round the promotion and furtherance of the economic relations between Iran and India by introducing and selling Indian goods in the Iranian markets. On the other hand a good many Indian nationals who are domiciled in Iran enjoy fullest security of life, proper -ty and honour under the Government of Iran. These hints should be expanded in an effective manner and poured out to the public in their own language. Secondly, if the Bombay Government deem it advisable all ! the Iranian nationals in Bombay may be asked to fly Iranian flags or even white flags on their shops and houses to show their identity and this fact should be brough to the notice of the public through advertisements with a warning that no harm £&gt; fi' ■ 'd rards these tragic events should ......— . m ''x . 3 . I : ' * ^ : should come to them (Iranians). Thirdly, I feel the most fruitful step would be that Bombay Government should warn the public that the residents of the locality in which an Iranian national or any property belonging to an Iranian national comes to harm, shall be responsible and liable to pay a collective fine. The above hints are only my personal views and as I have pointed out earlier in this letter it is up to the Government of India to do the needful to afford full protection and security to the Iranian nationals residing in this country. I anticipate my thanks for an immediate action in the above matter. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- A. Motamedy. Consul General for Iran.'■a* ftFrom No.F.lS-ME/46.

Tliis is in reply to your letter to Harrison of the 21st February (E1468/816/34) about the Persian Government’s complaint canceming alleged loss of life and damage to property sustained by Persian nationals in Bombay. The Persian Government have now raised this matter in three places; first through their Consul-General in Delhi, secondly through their Ambassador in London (on two occasions) , and now through H.M. Ambassador in Teheran (see Le Rougetel’s telegram to the Government of India No. 44 of 10th February, repeated to F.O. as No. 210). I do not think that it is, reasonable to expect the Government of India to return a full reply in all three places at once and they/matter to be dealt with through the Persian Consul- Gkneial at Delhi (telegram No. 11224 - dated 11th February). In the circumstances we should prefer that the reply suggested in that telegram should now be given to Taqizadeh, especially as this is in line with what Sir Orme Sargent said to the Ambassador on 3rd February. Moreover, we have not yet seen what reply the Government of India have returned to text of that before asking them to reconsider their earlier answer. a f&gt;. DONALDSONI ii.it 7/1 Confidential.

In the meantime the Persian Government continue to manifest no intention whatever of settling the claim in question, nor, in spite of repeated invitations, of dis charging a number of further debts which they owe to British and British-Indian subjects. It appears indeed that the Persians, although in most cases they have already admitted the justice of these various claims, have made no provision of funds to mi^et them, and their present budgetary arrangements admit of no such extraordinary expenditure as would be necessary for the purpose. They appear to take the view, furthermore, that, since His Majesty 1 s Government owe more money, since the War, to the Persian Government than they to His Majesty^ Government, they should not be required to make any payment until the larger debt is settled. 3. In these circumstances I can foresee no possibility of the satisfaction of these claims, unless we on our side oblige the Persians by some form of retaliation to make an effort to find the necessary funds, or alternatively find the money ourselves by withholding payments due by His Majesty^ Government to the Persian Government. In view of the difficulties in the way of retaliation, I therefore^ suggest that all these outstanding claims should be taken into account in the ultimate financial settlement, between the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government, of war-time transactions. 4. I understand that it may take a long time to strike a balance. Presently, however, some cash payment, whether by His Majesty’s Government or by the Persians, is envisaged rnd will eventually be made. My proposal is that the sum total of moneys due to British and British-Indian subjects in respect of these claims should be deducted from any total decided to be payable by his Majesty’s Government; or alternatively added to the total payable by the Persian Government, although I understand that this is a less probable contingency. /5. 1 The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, M.P. , His Majesty’s Principal S^cr^tary of State for Foreign Affairs, foreign Office, LONDON S, W # 1.5 .

The Government of India are issuing instructions that the payment of this claim should be withheld for the present but they think it unlikely that suspension of payment of so small a matter will avail to secure payment by the Persian Government of Marain Singh 1 s claim.

The Persians cannot of course expect to receive special treatment and they will simply benefit like others from any general measures which may be taken by the local authorities for the maintenance of law and order. But measures are presumably being taken for the protection of life and property in general from which Persians in Bombay will benefit and so far as we can see it could do no harm to tell the Persian Ambassador so.

Q-arran Esq., Foreign Office. Will you please refer to your letter No.E.11744/570/34 of 13th January about certain British and Indian claims against the Persian G-ovemment. We have no knowledge of the Indian claims in this Office and would prefer that no instructions were sent from here to H.M. Ambassador about the manner in which SucL claims should be handled. In our view it would be better for them to be dealt with^ as a separate issue from the purely British claims.in correspondence between the Government of India and H.M. _ ' -t* ^4-4 v* a 4- V-\ o +* 4'V^&lt;a In this connection we note that the Government of India will now have a lever J /againstagainst the Persian Government in the shape of Persian claim^ for damages inflicted on Persian subjects during the Bombay riots (Persian i Ambassadors letter of 22nd January to Mr. Bevin). We would suggest that you modify your drafts accordingly. N F. A. K.

Te propose to write as^ in the attached drafts to the 7 / ar (Office and Tehran, b&gt;?t, since some of the claims are Indian, we should like to obtain your concurrence before we do so. i/ill you therefore please let me know if you concur in the drafts and if you agree that it is 'appropriate for the United Kingdom Government to* take the action'recommended by the Ambassador in respect of Indian claims. / F.A.K. Harrison, Asc., India Office.Sir With reference to this .^nbassy’s letter No. 91 / 9/46 of the 29 th May, addressed to the Eastern Department, I have the honour to send you a copy of the reply of the Government of India to the letter of Sir Clarmont Skrine which was enclosed therein, together with a copy of the Embassy’s reply. 2. In the meantime the Persian Government continue to manifest no intention whatever of settling the claim in question, nor, in spite of repeated invitations, of dis charging a number of further debts which they owe to British and British-Indian subjects. It appears indeed that the Persians, although in most cases they have already admitted the justice of these various claims, have made no provision of funds to meet them, and their present budgetary arrangements admit of no such extraordinary expenditure as would be necessary for the purpose. They appear to take the view, furthermore, that, since His Majesty’s Government owe more money, since the War, to the Persian Government than they to His Majesty’s Government, they should not be required to make any payment until the larger debt is settled. 3* In these circumstances I can foresee no possibility of the satisfaction of these claims, unless we on our side oblige the Persians by some form of retaliation to make an effort to find the necessary funds, or alternatively find the money ourselves by withholding payments due by His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Government. In view of the difficulties in the way of retaliation, I therefore suggest that all these outstanding claims should be taken into account m the ultimate financial settlement, between the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government, of war-time transactions. 4. I understand that it may take a long time to strike a balance. Presently, however, some cash payment, whether by His Majesty’s Government or by the Persians, is envisaged and will eventually be made. My proposal is that the sum total of moneys due to British and British-Indian subjects in respect of these claims should be deducted from any total decided to be payable by His Majesty’s Government; or alternatively added to the total payable by the Persian Government, although I understand that this is a less probable contingency. /% 1 The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, M.P. , His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, LOUDON S, W. 1. _- 2 ~ Rrj ~raa *? e grateful to be informed whether you a to ree to this procedure; and if so I should be glad if vou further 6 cla 1 t0 the War 0ffice ’ wh ° well have turther claims which have never been referred to this Embassy. f* i attac h a list of the claims at issue, showing the -mounts of money involved in each case.

I am airected to refer to your letter No. 104 (91/6/46) da tea the 2nd May, 1946, and to say that in the circumstances, the Government of India are inclined to agree to the principle suggested in parr .3 °f your letter under reference. But there is only one claim by a Persian national outstanding against the Government of India, for about RS. 450 OA worth of property which is reported to be in the possession of the Bihar police. The Government of India are issuing instructions that the payment of this claim should be withheld for the present but they think it unlikely that suspension of payment of so small a matter will svail to secure payment by the Persian Government of Narain Singh’s claim. Subject therefore to any further advice which you may wish to give, the Government of India would prefer to release this property from police custody ana restore it to the owner, one Mohd. s/o Dawood Beg, through the Persian Consul-General in Yew Delhi who has made a representation to the Government of Inaia on his behalf.

You should reject any claims which are not good in principle and if you are doubtful about any of the ^ should refer to foe. You should have no hesitation in cutting down the figures put forward by any of the claimants if you regard them as excessive. There is no need to obtain the agreement of the individuals or the Companies concerned to the amounts which iis Majesty’s Government are to claim on their behalf. The position of these persons is that they are perfectly free to pursue their own claims in their own way if they wish, but if they ass His Majesty’s Government to te.ce them up His Majesty’s Government will deal with them as ^ they thinic proper and settle thera on vrhat terns they thinic fit. 3* If agreement can be reached with the Persian Government as to the amounts Of the clairrS so much the better.
