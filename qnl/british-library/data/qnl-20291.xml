They regard appointment of a Customs Director as useless unless one or other of ahove remedies is accepted 'in principle by Shaikh beforehand. IX „ Iraq Government consider that only alternative to restriction of imports into Kuwait of the seven articles mentioned is establishment of an efficient preventive service which owin^, to absence of any physical features on boundary practically amounts to a blockad e. This would only lead to embitterment of relations between Kuwait ana Iraq and is, I submit, contrary to common sense since plain fact is that excess of imports should not be allowed into Kuwait at all. For last 15 months Iraq Government have deferred taking active measures on the lines adopted by Ibn Saud in the hope that through the good offices of His Majesty's Government Shaikh would be brought to reasonable frame of mind. 5 . It is probably true that Iraqi Customs officials have committed illegal acts in Kuwait waters but it is a complete misunderstanding of position and facts to say that obvious aim of Iraq Government for the last 3 years has been to bully the Shaikh into co-operating. Iraq genuinely desires to live on best of terms with Kuwait^but expect! neighbourly conduct from Shaikh. regards it as a definitely jmfriendly act that Shaikh should allow large quantity of goods to be imported into his country which he knows can only be intended to be smuggled into Iraq. If blockade is established I do not think that Iraq vail deliberately cut off Kuwait water supply, ^s however bloekade entails prohibiting entry of Kuwaitis into Iraq territory, restrictions /-3- restrictions on entry of Kuwaiti boats into Iraq territorial waters must necessarily follow. This will :-ean in practice restrictions on movements of Kuwait water boats and a heavy increase in cost of their operations. Iraq Government are fully determined to take every effective defensive measure they can to preserve their interests. Unless His Majesty's Government can bring about some amelioration of present position it is inevitable that Iraq will shortly demand a representative of her own and it will be difficult to resist the justice of her claim. (o- To sum up. If useless expense and embittered relations are to be avoided Shaikh must be persuade d to agree to appointment of British Director of Customs in Kuwait and Restrictions on import ox the seven specified articles to bona fide requiremenLS of his people. On their part Iraq ■ Government will be ready to assist him financ ially. These in my opinion are btxsic principles of any lasting solution and time is running short. -HUIU-HRYS- (Copy given to Political ngent, Kuwait)V 1 V Telegram From To Repeated to Dated 6th (received 7th March) 1935.

On the other hand this agreement appears to be qualified by continued insistence on unconditional limita tion of imports. It is hardly possible for H.M. CK to press Bhaikh to accept at dictation of Iraq Govt a schene # which would amount to severe rationing of his principal iiaports, since this would amount to virtual renunciation of his independent rights to maintenance of which you attach greatest importance and would involve legitimate transit trade. On latter point, although H.M. G # realise that efficient customs control may result in substantial diminution of imports into Koweit, they cannot accept Iraqi suggestion that there can be no legitimate importa tion into Koweit of articles named in Iraqi special list except J f if 5-2 - 5,000 B D - R P- ■* V / ^ - 2 - except in so far as they are required for local Koweit consumption^ They believe, provided economic relations oi Koweit with Saudi Arabia can be established on nonaal basis, koweit*s natural position as an entrepot may be expected to assert itself. 3* H»M»Gr. consider that a satisfactory scheme for preventing illegitimate export of goods from Koweit can be evolved without arbitrary and unconditional limitation of imports. Detailed scheme will have to be worked out between Political authorities in Gulf in consultation with shaikh, with H.IU Embassy Bagdad, and with Iraq Oovt (in consultation with their British advisers). 4» It must however be made quite clear that H.M.G. cannot agree to any arrangement which would involve raising of Koweit tariff to Iraq level (you will remember that by treaty Shaikh is limited to 4. j on British goods) and that any arrangement of limitation of imports or fixing of maximum quota in respect of individual articles would be acceptable only if framed in such a way as not to derogate from Shaikh's independent rights. 5. In these circumstances you will appreciate that&gt; although they are willing to bring pressure on Shaikh to settle with Iraq Govt on reasonable terms, H.hU G-. can not do so until they are assured that Iraq Govt for their part will abandon their rigid insistence on one particular set of measures vlsu arbitrary and uaconditional limita tion of imports at Iraq dictation and will be prepared to negotiate some alternative but equal Ineffective solution. Without such an assurance it is useless for Ii.II. G, to approach Shaikh while to give it need not in any way debar Iraq Govt from reverting later to their present demands if negotiations on reasonable basis fail. 6.. Urgency of matter is due to threats of Iraq Govt. How that ii. u. g . are actively intervening I trust these can for tine at any rate he laid aside. JUiG. have no objection to creation of strong Iraq preventive force on frontier which would in that case fowa part of any proposal of theirs for a settlement. Cannot Iraq Govt budget for institution of such a force at once this might help to reassure their own public opinion and might also help H .M .G. in persuading Shaikh to be reason- able# 7. Meanwhile T shall 'be glad if either with or with out further consultation with Iraqi authorities you will confirm at earliest xx^ssible moment that Iraq Govt will oe willing to discuss settle ent of this Question on basis of appointment of British or British Indian Customs Director Koweit without prejudice to further details of scheme which will be freely worked out between interested parties and H.M.

Your telegram No.84 Cabinet are so engrossed in grave situation that has arisen from Middle Euphrates (see my telegram No-60) that there is no possibility of further discussion with responsible Ministers before Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is due to leave Kuwait. I am informed however by !:r.Hogg that it is hopeless to expect that the Iraq Government would be willing to discuss settlement of smuggling question ch basis of appointment of British Customs Director Kuwait alone. Their objections to this course are (1) several months will probably elapse beiore Director is installed. (2) Director cannot do anything to control smuggling without administrative sanction o± Shaikh behind him and would be regarded by Iraq Government as a mere facade. (3) unless one or other of principle ('measures) suggested by Iraq Government is adopted m advance of Director's appointment (details of course would have to be discussed later) they are convinced that not (?nothing) but. procrasti- nation will result. 1-2- / i A I am aware that Shaikh of Kuwait is limited by Treaty tc 4% import duty on British goods but I regard this stipulation in present circumstances as an anachronism when import duty levied by neighbouring States ori such an article as sugar is at least 26 times greater than the maximum imposed on Kuwait by our Treaty. As regards the secona alternative, Iraq Government are not seeking to impose arbitrary limitation on Shaikh but ask that he should be invited to suggest restriction by license on the seven articles princi^a 11^' smuggled into Iraq after Kuwait's needs have been met. -i-i + In this Iraq-Kuwait controversy we have an excelxen^ opportunity of exercising our genius lor mediation.

''H Some sa^estions for oooperation, open to the Shaikh, I, (a) In view of the fact that 95^ of the smuggling with Iraq is done by Euphrates river tribal fraternity (riverain tribes), the shaikh could offer to stop every Iraqi tribesman entering Kuwait Town unless in possession of a special certificate of Identity or Pass, signed and issued by his own Mutasarrif, ^airaakam or Mudir. Such pass not only to authorize him to proceed to Kuwait, but to contain on it the articles of food or clothing he desired to purchase there. (b) As a quid pro quo the Shaiich to insist that the Iraq cioverniaent should establish 4 Customs posts on their side of the frontier and that proper patrolling take place between them. (c) Such posts to be at Safwan (already existing) Jarishan, Athaiba and Obeid/^ • (d) All passholders to be required to enter Kuwait territory and return again thi'ou^i one of the above posts. It being the duty of the Commander of the patrols working between posts to shephexd tiioesmen desiring to cross the frontier towards these posts. 2 # similarly in order to deal effectively vaith the few but highly dangerous and undesirable iraqi townsmen who armed with money, make a practice of coming down to Kuwait expressly for the purpose of arranging i^augr^Ling ventures, the Shaikh could ti hten up the existing Passport system and lay it down that no Iraqi Townsman desirous of visiting Kuwait, could leave Zubair, and pass Safwan post unless armed with a no objection Certificate given by H.M's Consul in Basra, 'she latter whenever an Iraqi townsman applied for a visa, would telegraph (at applicants expense) to the Political Agent, Kuwait, and enquire if there was any objection to his visiting the Principality. The type of undesirable it is requiredrequired to keep out are mostly known in Kuwait• should however, The Shaikh/as a quid pro quo make the proviso that Kuwaiti nationals desiring to return home from Basra should be exempt from this restriction, 4 # The Shaikh has already agreed to enforce the manifest system in full on goods leaving Kuwait by-sea:*7. / Your Excellency is not prepared, to make any advance on them, the Iraq Government will be forced to effect certain counter- measures . These generally will probably 'be as follows:- (i) The total prohibition of all imports from Kuwait into Iraq. (ii) The strengthening of the armed forces patrolling the land ^ frontier of IraQj and the imposi tion of a total blockade oi Kuwait. ■ (iii) Severe restrictions on the entry into Iraq-waters of Kuwait crait. (iv) The stopping of Kuwait boats getting water from the Shatu ai. Arab • (v) The withdrawal of the valuable Customs concession at present extended to Kuwait commerce# 5. For Your Excellency's : : information, in the last named, cate^or^ |, (v) are included the privileges of f export of goods from Iraq into Kuwait out of bond, and under drawback free of I customs and excise duty, and the con cession admissible to goods in transit, all of which privileges can he restrict ed or withdrawn by an Iraq Government Regulation• 6, His Majesty's Government consider that the situation has now developed into a very serious one for Your Excellency, and have accordingly instructed me to visit Kuwait and discuss the matter with you. ■uiH i w 7. The situation is nuw as follows: The Iraq Government^after representa tions from His Majesty's Government^ finally agree that their requirements will he met by the appointment of a British or British Indian Director of Customs with adequate staff in Your Excellency 1 s service. Half the cost dtf the Director and his staff would be paid to Your Excellency by the Iraq Government through His Maj esty's Government• A detailed scheme as to the measures which the Director will put into force will be worked out between Your Excellency^in consultation with myself)and the Iraq Government. If a scheme acceptable both to Your Excellency and to the Iraq Government tttc/Vu can be evolved the Director will^be appointed and the scheme put into effect. If no such scheme can be evolved then the iraq Government will have no choice but to put into operation any or all of the measures mentioned in para 4 above. 8. Taking all the circumstances ^.nto consideration His Majesty's Gowjpnment have directed me to give you the strongest possible advice to accept the scheme outlined above. They, further directed me to inform Your Excellency that should you not accept, since all the measures proposed by the Iraqi Government are within /X2 7 \dtiiin their legal rights Eis Majestyfe Governrrient will be unable to give joU* amy further assistance in the matter.ryv61 ^ 1 ' Shaikh's explanation * 3- 5, He concluded 'by saying that he was most anxious that His Majesty's Government should not be under the impression that his attitude was simply one of obstinacy and asked me on his behalf to explain to His Majesty's Government that thi^ matter while one perhaps of loss to I^/aq was one of life or death to Kuwait. That he was surrounded by larger and stronger powers which, either by actual blockade as in the case of Bin Saud or by impossible high tariff as in the case of Iraq and Persia, rendered licit tr^de impossibleV That his Principality was a desert producing nothing but grass for animals and that the only way that his people could live and get money to make purchases of food and clothing from India was by making Kuwait, a market town for the interior including the Iraqi bedouin tribes. That in tl.ese circumstances the matter was one of life or death to Kuwait and that as for the blockade (the serious consequences of which I have drawn to his attention) he would prefer 'to be killed rather than to commit suicide'. 6. The Shaikh spoke sincerely and with some feeling and in the main his arguments from his point of view appear to Dickson and i^ijas myself to have much in them.B y Air Mail.

It is the funetion of Uovernfaexits, not ot their employees, to sanction meaeures «ueh a© raising or lowering one torn* tariff*, or Isspoein^ restrict lone on imports and exports. Thus, mlesa the Shaikh can fee induced to Intimate his assent to the grant of special powers to the proposed Onstoms Director, the appointment will hold out no prospect of a reduction of those itt|&gt;orts which can only he destined for illicit export to Irm^f and eleewiiere. I venture, therefore, to euis^st that your proposalsabould tee re examined in this light, 11. one other point which emerged during the discussion was the following. 12. The irmii Co re mi-sent idealise that measures intended to checii smugglingt hy reducing excess imports, will involve the shaikh in a lorn of revenue. Provided they are not asked to 'nalce this icood ^er ag — which wo^ild be tantf^iiount, in their view, to admittinir the principle that persons who. defraud the revenue are entitled to compensation if only their efforts are wiae and successful enough - they are anxious to give their assent to any measures which woua.4 afford to the :&gt;hai3ch an opportunity for aaicing good, within reasont revenue whldi he will lose if their proposals are applied. 'Tmy will, for example # bear part /at•4fth at l«a«t of r *hm of the Oustoaaa x^ilector and his ntmtt (provided th&amp;p h&amp;v® mntttQismt p&amp;mv to taka affective aetloai and will telp to defray tm coat of any other preventive imm~ m-es which the Shaikh My set on foot. In othei' words, they *111 pay the ahalith for any positive steps which he consents to take, and I gatherad that payment aould he made in such a way as to leave tae jlmikh a .good margin of profit on the trans action. iimt the Iraqi Government envism^e Is that ba should 9 in addition to appointing a fully eamowered Gmtomm .ulroctor, agree to the 0»tahliehment of a small ore-rentive force which would work under eitii^r tne Custoieu# director or a ©peclallj appointed British offieer, and In haraoBSr with the Iraqi rre- ventive ilervioea if Hi« Hajeaty'e Oovernmmt could see their way to a4*reo to thie In principle, detail© of the methods to 'be adopted sight well be left for future disouaeioru In that event* I venture to express Ine hope thataay particular method which may promise to he desirate would no^ 'be then ruled out on h priori grounds. If the Shaikh is willing to co-operate in these directions, the Iraqi Qov&amp;rrmmt see no difficulty in giving hin pecuniary satisfaction, which will, in effect, tafce the form of a concealed subsidy. IS. Huri :?asha took no part in the discussion except to wards the end, when he pointed out that Hie Majesty*! &amp;ormrwmnt f although actuated by the best of siotivea, had ®o far only examined tm possibility of Aediatlon* Nothing had yet hee^ actually said to the jhaika and meanwhile the latest figure# ■- shewed that smuggling from Kuwait was increasing at an alarming rate and in al&amp;ost geomtrie progression. rropesals for gradual action, therefore* seeded to he wide of the Marie, and be earnestly trusted that, on re-eximlnlng the position.

Tney toew that, in the last rosort, the ottos of reap onsibilAty for preventing the ^ntry Into Iraq of illicit roods rested upon theia, unci, failing the good offices of Hia Majesty*8 OoT^maent, they would have to take energetic action, if only to meet the growing criticism of the Iraqi public. ''hey had deferred taking such action during the last eighteen nontho, partly because they wishec to avoid cosplications with the Shaikh and possibly with 3audi- /irshia, hut mainly because they were adviged. 'by His Majesty's Qovemaent to avoid drastic unilateral awssuros. 14. I as aware that thz abow adds little to tue inform ation already furnished by ray predecessor on this subject.

I sutait my observations herewith. 2 # The basic facts of the situation, wnich I have put forward in varioue of «cr d.«patcb.. on the subject, seem to me to be as follows: (a) The Shaikh of Kuwait as an Independent Ruler canuot, underjlntemational law or praetice, be called upon to a^ist the Iraq Government in th. latter-s anti-smu^ling measures, more especially since the smugglers are Iraqis and the smuggling business is largely organized ana financed £*»« Iraq. (b) The Iraq Government no doubt 0 .ifier loss oy ***** or twe trade between Kuwait and Iraq. (c) On tne other hand it must be redelivered tnat Kuwait, vjhich has no manufactures whatever and ^ows no crops of any kind, ^st for her ve^wrf^ance traae iicitly, or illicitly /illicitly, with her neighbours in order to obtain funds wherewith to purchase the necessaries of life. Two of these neighbours - Iraq and Persia - have chosen to erect extravagant tariff barriers while tne third - Saudi Arabia - has imposed a cos^lete blockade against Kuwait. (d) It will be seen therefore that the trade between Kuwait and Iraq is a matter - alraost literally ~ of life and death to the former. (e) It is no doubt for this reason, and not from mere obstinacy, that the Shaikh of Kuwait has found himself compelled to adopt a non -co-operative attitude with Iraq# (f) Whether (1) the trade with Iraq is stopped at the Kuwait end by the Shaikh co-operating with the Iraq Government in anti -smuggling measures, or (2) whether this trade is stepped hy the Iraq Government instituting preventive measures at their end, Kuwait is bound to suffer. The Shaikh having regard to his responsibilities to his people has to decide whether they will suffer less under (1) or (2). (g) British interests are not directly involved. If British goods are stopped from going to Iraq through Kuwait, they will still continue to enter Iraq through Basrah* (h) If mediation by His Majesty's Government (i.e. advice to the Shaikh to «cept such of the Iraq measures as seem reasonable totban) failS^ ana. iraq declares a blockade, provided the Iraq measures are legal. His Majesty's Government have no further responsibility in the matter. The question of an Iraq blockade is entirely different from that of the Saudi blockade /. a) -3- blockade since with regard to the latter Eis Majesty f s Government promised the Shaikh, in return for his not assisting the rebels against I'bn Saud in 1929, that they would do their best to get it removed. (i) In view of the above considerations I am strongly of opinion that His Majesty's Government's mediation should not go further than giving advice to the Shaikh as in para graph 2 (h) above. It is in my opinion essential that we should not lay ourselves open to an accusation either by the 3iaikh, or by his people^, thathunder pressure from us as opposed to advice , for the benefit of Iraq measures were forced upon Kuwait which caused loss to the latter. (J) 1^ 'the Shaikh without pressure from us either accepts co-operation with Iraq, or decides to run the risk of the Iraq blockade (see paragraph 2 (h) above), the responsibility will be that of Kuwait and not of His Majesty's Government• 3. The present proposals of the Iraqi Government as given paragraphs 9 and 12 of iu&amp;bassadox''s despatch appear to be as follows: (a) The appointment of a British Customs Director at Kuwait. (b) The granting to this Director oi 'powers other than those usually invested in such an official' suflicient to enable him to carry out measures which (in the opinion of the Iraq Government) are essential to atop smuggling* (c) The establishment of a small Kuwaiti preventive force to work either under the Customs dree tor or a specially appointed British Officer, and in harmony with the Iraqi Preventive Service. (d) Should the Shaikh agree to the above the Iraq Gove rment /-4- Goveinment on their side are prepared to assist the Shaikh to make good, within reason, the revenue he will lose if their proposals are applied. They will e.g. meet part of the salaries of the Customs Director and his staff and of the cost of other preventive measures, payment on this account will be made 'in such a way as to leave the Shaikh a good margin of profit on the transactiono' 4, with regard to (a). This His Majesty's Government have approved of. (2) With regard to (b). I suggest that the Iraq Government might be asked to define in more detail what exactly are the unusual powers which they propose the Director of Customs should be invested with. (3) With regard to (c). Should this force be established I hardly thinlc that a special British Officer would be necessary since it could work adequately under the Director. (4) With regard to (d). Since the Iraq Government propose to meet only part of the cost of the j;irector, of his preventive measures and of the Preventive orce, however lar^e this part may be the Shaikh will lose the balance of the cost of these measures in a ddition to the loss of revenue from the consequent reduction of trade. Unless, therefore, the Iraq Government intend to make some further payments, in some form or other, there would not seem to be any real compensation for the Shaikh. sd. T.C#Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel.

For some two years the Iraqi Government had endeavoured unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the Shaikh on this matter* 2* Sir Francis Huaphrys acted promptly on Huri Pasha 's suggestion and for the past few months the question of smuggling from Kuwait has formed the subject of most earnest consideration, not only by His Majesty 4 s Government but also by His Majesty's Embassy in discussion with the heads and advisers of the competent departments of the Iraqi Government and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* 3* I now have pleasure in informing Your Kxcellency that His Majesty's Government are prepared to use their good offices and to urge the BhajLidi st»i*on4&gt;Xy to accept a solution of the present difficulties on bases approxi' 1 ' mating to those which emergod from the dlacuasiona mentioned above* 4^ His Excellency Yasin Pasha al Hashimi, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, BAGBAD e0 w» 2 1. 4* i'htjs© b&amp;sos isay 'b© feFlefly and ^en^raXly auiasiarised as follow:- (1) Ttm appointment of a BPltiah Guatoma Bix^ctor at Kuwait with special powere (not excluding the poaalbility of restricting the import of certain cosuaodities) t who would work in cloae liaison with the Iraqi Customs authorities and the Political Agent at Kuwait# (2) The co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait in making effective a frontier control and customs cordon system to be set up by the Iraqi Government. 5* In order that the problem may be adequately considered in all its aspects 9 and details worked out with a view to arrive at a satisfactory solution to all concerned, His Majesty's Government propose that a conference, presided over fcy the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be called at a very early date at some convenient place at which the Iraqi Govern ment and the Shaikh of Kuwait would be represented* 6.

I enclose herewith copy of letter of 23rd May from the , Embassy to me (with enclosure, letter of the same date from the Embassy to the Iraq Government), from which it will be seen that the Iraq Government have agreed that, from their own point of view, the Shaikh of Kuwait may now be approached on the lines proposed by His Majesty t s Government. It is hoped to hold the conference, proposed in paragraph 6 of Foreign Office telegram No. 147 of the 21st May, between the 9th and 16th June (paragraph 7 of Embassy letter to the Iraq Government quoted above). I have heard in the last few days from the Political Agent, Kuwait, that the Shaikh wishes to visit England in June for medical treat ment, and my first step must be to induce him to postpone his visit until I have had time to put the Iraqi proposal before him. 2. I observe from paragraphs 2 and 3 (b) of Foreign Ofx % ice telegram just quoted that, in spite of the arguments put forward l^fin my Express Letter No. 354-S of 30th April, (particularly those contained in paragraphs 2 (a), (c), (e), (h) and (j). His Majesty* Government are apparently still prepared In certain eventualities to^ ^ ^ p' 1, ' 'a - 2 - t 0 bring pressure on the Shaikh to aeeecle to the Ira q Qoveromenfs proposals# It appears to me that mediation or advice, even strong advice, is one thing, and pressure is quite another, and I venture once more to point out that the effect of any such pressure on our prestige, in Kuwait particularly, and in the Persian Gnlf generally, would he most unfortunate. m view of the fact that there is no legal obligation on the Shaikh to co-operate with the Iraq Govern ment and that British interests are not involved, it would be said, not only by the Shaikh of Kuwait and his people, but by the other Shaikhs of the Gulf (who will certainly hear of it), that for the benefit of Iraq, a (comparatively) large and independent Power, His Majesty s Government had forced a certain line of action on Kuwait, a small shaikhdom which is under our protection. Moreover, the whole position of His Majesty's Government in this matter of •pressure 11 on the Shaikh is, in my opinion, considerably weakened by the fact that His Majesty's Government — through no fault of their own - have been unable to implement their promises to the Shaikh with regard to the date gardens and Ibn Saud's blockade» I fear that mention of pressure from His Majesty's Government with regard to smuggling, will merely draw from the Shaikh the not illog ical reply that His Majesty's Governments pressure should be brought to bear first on Iraq to adjust the question of the date gardens, and of the incursions and outrages of the Iraqi Customs officials (for which so far no reparation has been forthcoming from the Ira. G-overnment), and on Ibn Saud to raise the blockade. Further, I do not see what pressure His Majesty's Government can bring to bear on the Shaikh beyond a more or less direct order that he should take this or that line of action in acceding to the Iraqi proposals and, if he should refuse to obey this order, which is not improbable (since legally he is not compelled to co-operate ^itji the Iraq Government over the smuggling), I do not see what lieasuresmeasures iiis Majesty's Government can take to enforce their corn- rands. We will then have a deplorable situation on our hands. We will get the full odiura of trying to bring pressure to bear on the Shaikh, the latter with the popular backing of his people will successiully have defied His Majesty's Qovernment, and all to no result since the Iraqis - His Majesty's Government's pres sure having tailed - will then proceed to institute their blockade ^ le other hand, if His Majesty's Government will stop at strong advice, no such situation can arise, and I urge most earnestly that, on further consideration, they will abandon any idea of pressure. Vis-&amp;-vis the Iraq_ Government, His Majesty *8 Government — it will be observed - are not committed to pressure! the terms used in paragraph 3 of the Embassy letter to the Iraq Government referred to above are that His Majesty^s Government are prepared 'to urge the Shaikh strongly 1 '.

After Compliments , During your present visit to Kuwait we have had various conversations at which Colonel Dickson was present, in the course of which you strongly advised me on behalf of His Majesty^ Government to accept generally certain proposals for stopping smuggling from Kuisait into IRAq. These proposals include the appointment of a Customs Director in Kuwait with special powers, which powers might include the resrfcriction on the import of certain articles into Kuwait, the formation of a preventive service by me, working in co-operation with a fully organised frontier service organised by the IRAQ Government, and a system of land manifests. The whole cost of the above measures to be met by the IRAQ Government. j^rt^er you informed me that the details of these proposals would be discussed at a conference over wHlch you would preside, Kuwait being represented by one Kuwaiti official and one British official, and IRA.Q, by one IRAQI official and one British official. You also warned me that if I did not accept the IRAQI proposals, the IRAQI Government would institute a ccmplete blockade of my State and might even place restrictions on the boats of my people |!, which fetch drinking water from the Shat al Arab. As I informed you verbally, I regret with all my heart tMt I am unable to accept the advice of fee High Government. I know ^hat the High Government will doubtless be disappointed at this and I would be very grateful if you would m- ^ nf &gt; you would forward this my letter to the Government of India to be placed before His Excellency the Viceroy, who I have had the honour of meeting when he passed through my State last year, and fron whom I have just received the honour of a 'Kharita' on the occasion of the Jubilee of His Majesty King George V, I would be grateful also if you would send j| a copy direct to His Majesty^ Government in London of this my letter. My object in making this request is because I wish to mlcB a personal explanation giving the reasons why I am unable to follow the advice of His Majesty's Government, since I do not wish His Majesty's Government to ttiink that in not following their advice, I am actuated by a spirit of obstinacy towards His Majesty's Government or by ill will towards IRA.Q. My reasons for not being able to follow the advice of the British Government are as follows:- In the first place I know that the IRilQ, Government has no legal right to ask me to do what they wish me to do, though this would not have prevented bb from helping as a good neighbour, if it bad been possible. In the second place, whether the smuggling is stopped by me in Kuwait or by the IRAQ, blockading forces, there will be grevious loss to my small State, which grows nothing but grass, and which therefore entirely depends on trade with the interior^in order to get money where with to buy food and clothing from India/for its popu lation numbering about 100,000 people. If this loss is incurred by reason of action by the ISA, I *.11 &gt;»1&lt;1 »1»«- !..* ty T People.

Secondly - The whole of Arabia would understand that Kuwait had surrendered her liberty to IRAQ,, and so had become a vassal of hers. Thirdly - I, the Shaikh, would be regarded as a traitor by all the members of my family as well as by all the people of Kuwait, and I would be execrated, and possibly have to meet great difficulties and troubles. Fourthly - Bin Saud would hi..self say that 'The Shaikh of Kuwait has surrendered his State to IRAQ/ 1 . He would tell his people that when it was Q case xxx of his asking for a single Muslim representative to reside in Kuwait to collect transit dues, I the Shaikh, refused though now at the the request of ^IRAQ, Government I had consented to a Christian Director of Customs with very large powers. It will not be forgotten that in refusing Bin Saud^ request on the grounds that such would have been interpreted as placing Kuwait under Nejd control, I had the support and sympathy of His Maj esty t s G-ovemment • gjfthly - With Kuwait trade gone, and I, the Shaikh, a traitor to my people, there will follow an exodus 'Hajir' from the town, of my leading citizens, notables and mer chants. If however the loss is occasioned not by Jiy fault, my family and my people will support rae in my troubles. Since therefore I am unabie to agree to the IRAQ, proposals, tixere would be no benefit in holding the con ference suggs sted by His Majesty's Government. If the IRAQI Government therefore wish to impose a blockade, I +v , ptr , ana -orovided the measures they cannot of course stop them, n - take-11 take are lawful and on their side of the frontier, I realise that I can make no complaint to His Majesty's Government, and shall put my trust in G-od. All I ask from Eis Majesty's G-overnm^it is that the procedure of my date gardens in IRAQ,,as well as those of any of my subjects, which is sent to Kuwait, and the drinking water of my people, which comes from the Shat al Arab, should be immune from Blockade measures. In conclusion it will be seen that what I consider to be the honour of my State, is involved in this matter; and I am sure that the High British Government which has due regard always for her own honour, and which entered the great war for the protection of a snail Btate like Belgium, will consider my explanations and representations with sympathy# Usual Ending.53/0 Telegram R*27.

(Signature) In / S. 44. {Designation)In spite of the fact that I stopped at 'advice' (in view of the Shaikh 1 s attitude to have proceeded to 'pressure' would have merely precipitated the deplorable situation indicated in paragraph 3 of my Express Letter quoted above) the Shaikh evidently felt very strongly and very sincerely (a view which naturally I did my best to eradicate but without success) that even in giving him advice His Majesty 's Government were taking the side of Iraq against him. He said with some emotion that he was being Mathloom (oppressed) and that his letter was meant as a Dakhala (an Arabic term used by a man appealing for protection from his overlord for his life) to His Majesty'cs Government. He accompanied this by the very expressive gesture of removing his head dress as if to lay it at my feet# 4* In these circumstances it would be v/orse than useless to pursue the matter further with the Shaikh* The only course now left is to inform the Iraq Government that in spite of our representations to the Shaikh the latter much regrets he is unable to agree to the Iraqi proposals - such of his reasons as seems suitable may be given. That the Iraqi Government are therefore free to institute their blockade and provided these measures are legal His Majesty's | Government have no intention of assisting the Shaikh. The latter it will fee noticed at the end of his letter states that he quite understands he cannot ask His Majesty's Govern- , ment for intervention, except in themat .er of produce from his and his people's gardens feeing imported into Kuwait, and , with regard to the drinking water from the Shatt -al-Arafe. sd.

Moreover (b) while Shaikh rejects H.M*s. Governments strong advice and says that he is prepared to face blockade by Iraq he somewhat inconsistently looks to H.lPs. Government to limit blockade in respect of certain matters i.e. Kuwait date produce in Iraq,and water supply, though presumably strict blockade contemplated by Iraq Government primarily means prohibition of imports from Kuwait they have also contemplated cutting off of Kuwait water supply { see iiaghdad telegram of 19th February, no. 47 ).His Majesty's Govern- are -ment jBHxMxke unable to guarantee that such a step would be held to exceed Iraq Governments legal rights, though on grounds of humanity alone we should of course seek to dissuade them from taking2 it* in any case prospect of Iraq seeking to apply euch extreme measures of coercion seems, apart from other conBiderations, to make it impossible for H.M*s* Government to wash their hands of dispute and Shaikh's request that we should secure immunity of water supply and date produce in iraq affords good grounds for urging him afresh to reconsider his intransigeance. Prospect moreover that H.M f s. Government could, if an extreme strain is placed on Kuwait - Iraq relations, succeed in obtaining satisfaction over ownership of date gardens would almost vanish# While this and smuggling problems are distinct in theory Iraq Government are unlikely to keep/ them separate in practice and finally failure ower date gardens would both be expensive to ENM*s. Government and damaging to them in the Persian Gulf. H.M* s« Government have in all discussions given full weight to the arguments advanced by you and the Government of India against direct inter- -vention. Hiey quite agree that it may be possible to let matters take their course for some little time. But they remain of opinion that intervention will be necessary sooner or later if ( as is essential ) they are to maintain their control of Kuwait 1 s relations with her neighbours and avoid the odium of failure to protect her, which would inevitably fall back on H.M t s. Government dispite any disclaimer of res- -ponsibility. It has been for this reason that they have been so anxious to ( find an) equitable via media .-3- (e) If Iraq is now allowed to apply sanctions it will be quite impossible in practice for His Majesty^ Government to ensure that these are kept within legitimate limits or to secure any real satisfaction from Iraq if they are not* That cannot fail to do us damage locally. (f) Moreover if sanctions are sufficiently effective to make Shaikh sue for terms there can be no question that terms asked by Iraq will be far more severe than at present. (g) You will, apart from this, appreciate that if serious situation develops later and Shaikh then asks for our support His Majesty's Government might well be reluctant to risk grave breach with Iraq in which their interests are so great merely in order to extricate Shaikh from difficulty of his own making which can be avoided by him adopting a less intransi- geant attitufie now. 3» If in the light of above and in particular paragraph 2 (b) you are prepared to approach Shaikh further we should welcome it and trust you will do all in your power to make him see reason. ^ 4. Since above was written I have seen Bagdad telegram dated the 22nd June No.169 to Foreign Ofiice. If Shaikh really proposes to leave for Bagdad 24th June notwithstanding advice to the contrary which you instruct ed Political Agent to give him in paragraph 3 of your telegram dated 13th June No .495 and if you decide that he should be approached on ihe ibove lines you will no doubt consider desirability of ins\ructing Dickson to make further attempt vV 0 to /- 4 - , to dissuade him from going to Bagdad at once or if this fails accompany him to Bagdad and to make further appeal to him before any communication is made to Iraq Government by Clark Kerr.. -Secretary of State for India♦j'l/W, i-i/s 3' t nftfe Te le graai R 27 Ftoxd Political Agent, Kuwait* To Poli tical Re al dent, Bushire# Hoc 207 Dated and received 23rd June 1935* Inapediate* Per information# Bin Saud has u telegraphed Shaikh wishing him god speed and speedy return from London in best of health# Shaikh telegraphed King of Iraq privately yesterday informing him of his arrival at Baghdad June 24th« Political53/85 '-f nh Telegiram xx Prom H.lTs Secretary of State for India, London, 'i'o Political Resident, Bushire # No, 1937. ^ated and received 23rd June 1935.

I was very glaa indeed that in the actual event the Government of India did intervene in the matter • vide their telegram No. 1492 of 16th June| even though His Majesty's Government h^d not asked for their advice* 2 m r, I do not consider that there is any advantage in the Government of India intervening unasked in this matter'. This remark in your letter, if it indicates a new attitude on the part of Government towards Gulf problems, fills me with some alarm and despondency. The Gulf is of course in a different position to what it was in the past, and the centre of interest has inevitauly owing to changed conditions shifted from India to Whitehall. I quite realise this, and personally pursue the policy of worrying Government as little / as possible over my Gulf problems. The only occasions on which I send an S.O.S. for their support are those of first- class importance* 3. At the same time until - if ever - the Gulf is formally divorced completely from the control of the Govern ment of India the latter have certain definite interests and responsibilities in this part of the world. All the officers in the Gulf, from the Resident downwards, belong to the Foreign and irolitical Department, and about 90% of the clerical staff are British Indians# There are considerable / Hon 1 ble ^•H,A.F.Metcalfe,C.S.I. |C.I.£. f K.V»0., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla, n &gt;:2 considerable British Indian communities both in Persia, and more especially in the ,^rab states, and their principal trade is with India • The system of law administered based on the Orders in Council is Indian, and the Treaties with the Shaikhs were made with the Government of India# The Government of India pay fifty-fifty with His Majesty's Government towards Gulf expenses (at Muscat and Bahrain they bear the whole incidence of the cost) and he who pays half the piper has the right to call at least half the tune* 4» This being so I think it would be a ^eat pity if Govern ment allowed themselves to drift out of the Gulf picture to the extent of only giving their opinion on Gulf problems when specifically asked to do so by His Majesty^ Government. It does not seem to me that the latter expect this as they repeat anything of importance to you# 5# I daresay I am unnecessarily alarmed, and am arguing from the particular to the generals that there were some features in the Kuwait-Iraq Smuggling shemozzle which difieren- tiated it in your opinion from other Gulf questions, though it does not appear to me to be different from them in principle• And I am certainly crying out before I am hurt since 1 have always received a measure of support from the uovemment of India (including the ^resent case of the Smuggling) for which I am most grateful* 6.

I have recently received confirmation from European ousiness men that smuggling of goods through Koweit to Iraq has enormously increased during the past year and is still increasing. Smuggled articles are chiefly those on which high rate of duty is levied, viz. sugar, tea, matches, cigarette paper and tobacco. Smuggling on present scale has serious ea...ect, not only on revenues but on prestige of Iraq Government, and they are determined to put a stop to it. I am sending long despatch which should reach you next week suggesting means for arriving at agreed scheme of co operation between Iraq. Government and Shaikh of Koweit, through mediation of His Majesty's Government. If matters are allowed oo remain as they are and if Shaikh refuses to co-operate in suppression of smuggling through his territory, Iraq. Government, under pressure from Parliament, will inevit ably have recourse to extreme measures which may include a total blockade of Koweit. I shall therefore be grateful lor very early reply to my despatch. In the meantime Prime Minister has promised me to do his best to keep anti-smuggling measures within fair limits.Ho&gt; 711.

I would at the same time refer to the confidential despatch of the Honourable the Political esident in the Persian Gulijoa the same subject, Ho. 1046-8 of Koveruber 20th, 1934. v ■ * - - ^ ^ / % .3 S ' 1 havt; recently had occasion to talii privately on this topic with the Minister for foreign Affairs, and. Mr. oievwright, the British Inspector-General of the Customs and iixciae depart ment. It has already been made clear that, rightly or wrongly, the Iraqi Government regard Kuwait as a base for organised samggl- ing and tlicre is no doubt that the obduracy of the Shaikh of Kuwait in refusing to co-operate with them in any constructive measures for the suppression of this smu^giing Is tending to exasperate tne Iraqi Government. They are convinced that the Shaikh is simply evading the issue, and are now turning their Minds towards a programme of unilateral measures which carmot but operate to the severe detriment of the trade and commerce, licit 0) aa wll as illicit, of Kuwait. These measures include the total prohibition of iBporte from ..uwalt/toe Btrengthening of the armed forces patrolling the land frontier of Iraq, severe restriotions /V) upon xae entry into Iraqi waters of iiuwaiti craft, and the with drawal of the valuable customs concessions at present extended to iaiwaiti commerce* in the last named category are included the privileges of export of goods from Iraq to Kuwait out^f 1 bond^fre^ ox. cuBtoms and excise duty, and the concessions adjaissible to /woods 5 ^ight Honourable -ir John Simon, O.C .si. 1. , K.C.V. 0. , etc., etc., etc.- 2 - goods in transit, all of which privileges can be restricted or withdrawn by uovenuaent Hegulatioms* Th&amp;pe sire a nuiaber of Iraqi official® who are advocates of extreme measures and they urge this course of action on the grounds not only of the finan cial loss -which the Iraqi Treasury 1b suffering because ofthe vol use 01 goods pouring* into Iracj. and escaping custoas duty, 'but also because of the looa of prestige caused to the Iraqi Govem- laent by their failure to put an end to the activities of the law breakers engaged in the contraband trade, traders in Basra and i;ajal are complaining that normal trade is stagnating because of - « •. the increasing amount of smuggled goods entering their markets. It is possible to argue that both the extent of the smuggling and. the loss to the Iraqi Crovemaient therefroja are exa^i^t;rated- a dcsaber oi iay staff has been given an opportunity ol exasnining and analysing; statistics prepared and collected by the Iraqi Custoias -^epartaent f in an endeavour to assess the actual loss caused to Ira&lt;Qt by siaiig^ling frost Kuwait* These figures, of which the accuracy has been checked by a reference to the published figures o*. Kuwaiti trade, show that the excess of imports over exports into Jiuwait» i.e. the value of goods consujaed In, or exported (sou© at least illicitlyjfroa the Shaikhdoa was as follows in each of the last three years 1951/38 £109,047 1932/53 £150,210 1935/34 £184,831 it will be observed that the uount is steadily increasing.

The majority of these excess imports are comEsodlties on which a high rat© ci custoias duty is charged and the customs duty on the value ox the 'potential contraband' would oe a percentage of not less than or the value. On the other hand it is true to state that the potential profits from smuggling into i ersia and Kejd are greater than 'those obtainable from contraband running into Iraq_ and goods undoubtedly g'0 illicitly to these countries also. Iraq, however, oifers the easier and wider target and a greater prospect of success* ^ e * in^. 1 j * S kj fe-he i«'aq,i ' -ustoms detected 313 cases of smuggling, by land and sea, of goods which they believe to have emanated from the town of Kuwait. The value of these goods was approximately £11,500 and the duty thereon was £6,500. During the first half of 1954, 523 similar cases were detected,the goods seised being o. a value of £7,500, on which the customs duty pay able would have been £5,000* ^ is » or course, impossible to say with any accuracy &gt; Wh *!L the ttcVuaI loBS fvom Siiuggling is, but a study of the above anti o: ot ^ ior detailed facts and statistics which are avail able, renders it difficult to refute the allegations of the Customs /authorities- 4 - f . p authorities in Iraq, that (a) not iosb than £30,000 annually is lost to the Iraqi treasury and (b) the contraband buelnese, which is undoubtaoiy lucrative when tlia cargo gets through, is on the increase. Iraqi authorities strongly suspect that one of the reasons for the '.:&gt;.haiich lr ® continued refusal to take any active steps to combat this illicit trade is that he benefits personally by a share in the handsome profits derived from it. yen if this is untrue, he probably considers that the prosperity of his 3tttte is to some extent bound up with it, especially since the decline oi profit® derived from the pearl fisheries began to be felt by his subjects-. It i&amp; argued therefore that unless strong and stern measures are taken by Iraq, mmggllm will continue rile and uncheckea at the source. The advocates of the policy 1 blockade have not yet had their way because the cooler headed Iraqi statesmen are reluctant to do anything to embarrass, or to raise difficulties vis-fe-vis his Majesty's •uovemsent. The continued delay in reaching any sort of agree ment with the Shaikh is, however, making it more and more difficult ana unless some thing quite definite is done quickly, I fear that the advocates of a strict blockade will shortly gain their point. J ' CrS ' y/ ^ P^^®^* a ph o of your despatch under reference the view is expressed that it is for the Iraqi Government to take the initiative in the matter of suggesting measures of co-operation in -/hick the haiiLh might Join. X would point out, however, that the iraqi Oovemment have already placed two separate sets of v .x- v proposals before the haikh for his consideration. The first ; 4 &lt;. i scheme is described in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. '36 of 15th February last and was placed officially before the Shaikh, who, except for denying the existence of smuggling, returned merely a non-committal reply. ice vised proposals were submitted to him for hia consideration by the Iraqi delegates at their meeting in Bept- ember, as reported in £ta&amp; paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch*a express ^ ijrt. /letter httyf6 - / ; ( '' f of the Kuwaiti customs. I fully endorse Colonel Fowl©*® opinion that until the • hfilkb. Uftuoi-goao b . change ol hoar^t ovei* th.® ^u^stion of contraband trade a further conference between hixa and the Iraqi Government would not be attended by any fruitful reault, nor doe© it appear to me that any satisfaction would 'be derived from asking the Iraqi C.cyernnent at this stage to give full particulars of the manner in which they woulu propose to administer the laeasures suj;jested, the .haikii having already made it clear that he will have nothing to do witu them. It would appear, therefore, that, once again a deadlock has been reached and, in my view, it will only be removed by one of two courses (a) either/by the Iraqi Government taking matters into their own hands and. instituting rigorous action such as 1 have outlined in paragraph 2 above, or by his Majesty's Govermaeat actively intervening and bringing pressure to bear upon the Shaikh, in his own inter ests, ilB rk ®^arde course (a), I haVe the honour to transmit — Herewith copy of a letter from His Excellency Hurl pasha, from which it will be clear to you that the Iraqi Government desire no thing better than a working- agreement with the Shaikh, They do 10 ' wls * i tio Proceed to extreue measures. his Excellency left me In no doubt, however, during a oonversatioa which I held with hla on ./aca .bsr 11th, thnt the Iraqi Govet-nmsnt would not tolerate the present poeition indefinitely, and that, failing a satisfactory agreement with the Shaikh, they would be obliged, as a first step, to establiah such a strong lino of preventive custoMa posts along the frontier as to make smuggling virtually imposuible. l2 ' ' hi8 Ka ^ ultimately prove to be the only solution of the tliiTiculty should the Shaikh persist in his present attitude. In- tteeci, judging from the enclosed extract from Kuwait Intelligence . i &gt; J /Suiamar/- 7 _ /14. Suamapjr for the first half of Hoveaber, it way be deduced that the ihaikh himself would weloome such a step by the Iraqi Govern ment. Ke would, however, do well to take further thought. Given the lenj.th and nature of the frontier to be protected, the oon- atruction and Maintenance of an adequate line of cuotoms posts would ne costly and difficult. Once established, the Iraqi Croveraaent could be relied upon to sea that the/ got full value for their money, and I cannot but feel that it would be the first step towards the aore drastic neasures outlined in paragraph £ et seq above ending in the complete blockade of Kuwait. vhese apprehensions are shared by the . inioter for Foreign ..ffairs, who Informed Kie frankly that he deeply deplored the frequent occasions during the last two years on which his Majesty's iaabassy felt impelled to protest against the growing nuuber of alleged incidents, the truth of which it was impossible, in present circumstances, to ascertain. he hlntea, however, (and I cannot but feel that he is right., that If large numbers of preventive officials and poeeibly police and troops are posted along the frontier, they will naturally work as near as possible to the centre of the smuggl ing activity, and the number of clashes is likely to Increase rather than Giminish. j.rj all the cii 'cua.stances, therefore, I am loth to encourage the Iraqi Government to take the contemplated step unless and until it is clear teat no other course is feasible, ana until course (b) has received, consideration. 13. as regards this course, the Minister for Foreign Affairs appealed to »e to try and persuade my Government, as the Protector of Kuwait, to arrive at an understanding with the Iraqi Uovernment aa to what sort of arrangement could reasonably and fairly be .ut to the Shaikh and then to make it clear that unleaa he accepted he would forfeit toe sympathy of His Kajeaty's Government and could loo.; for no support from them in this particular matter. Given the present conciliatory attitude of the Iraqi uovei-nment, I feel that this appeal merits serious consideration./16# iiijls Is &amp; xaa*t»©i* .iSiXixim wjltixiiji titiQ spHci*© of Ktiwsijltir's ioreign x*©!jitioaSf to. which His Majestiy*8 iroverniaisnt arc r*t? sp ojgia i'oie. it eeeias to me that if His Ma jest#'s Government are to ta^e up the cudgels on behalf of the shaikh in his dealings with foreigner®, they are equally entitled to give him a clear leaa when, in their view, hie obduracy 1q euch as to cause grave harm to his relations vrith his neighboure. 15# 1 wuia therefore suggest that Colonel Fo ^le and Colonal .oiokmn be invited to come to Bagdad at their earliest convenience, u o discuss with this ..^.bacs^ and the Jritish customs officials in tne service of the Iraqi Government measures which could suitably be submitted to His : apasty's Government in the United Kingdom for approval. 1 have reason to believe that the Iraqi Government are not necessarily wedded to the schemes put forward in the past* Xhey have other measures injconte ablatio a and are ready to consider sympathetically any reasonable scheme^sponsored by Kis Majesty's Crovernment , whioh is calculated to put tv d end to the present situation. iu would be desirable therefore that the Representatives of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf should come to the pro posed conference armed with suggestions which, in the lightlof their personal experience, are such as could fairly be put to the bhalkh*// is obvious that such suggestions should be positive and should not reflect the negative and unhelpful attitude hitherto adopted by tne chaildi himself.

(c) The Shaikh in a recent instructive conversation with the writer compared Bin Saud's energetic methods with those of Iraq in the matter of trying to prevent Kuwait trade from going into the interior. To use his words as near as possible 'Bin Baud was manly and open enough to himself get on with the Job of trying to blockade Kuwait and keep her goods f out of Nejd. He acted firmly, sent cars, appointed good men to carry out orders, and never asked him, The Shaikh of Kuwait, to assist in the 'killing' of his town, of Kuwait. Bin Saud did his best to hurt Kuwait, of course, and he retal iated and did his best to avoid Bin baud's blockade measures, ^either of them complained to each other - both aid their best to defeat the other, and both remained friends. Why- could not Iraq, act as Bin Saud was doing? She objected to Kuwait trade going into Iraq, via the interior. Well ana good: but instead of placing pos'os and establishing strong- points on the frontier or behind it, with cars patrolling, etc., like Bin baud did, she asked him, the 3haikh,to assist in killing his town of Kuwait by taking action in Kuwait and against his own people. When he refused, Irag, 'squealed' to His Majesty's Government and begged them to assist in forcing Kuwait to do their (iraq/s) bidding. Ke opined in all seriousness that Iraq's clear and straightforward course was to impose a land blockade against Kuwait, if she would not agree to place a string of say 3 customs posts combined with strong points along her frontier line. This was what he would like to see Bin Saud do also, but the latter had not seen eye to eye with him on this front so far.'— — ^ 1 'ill IB ^ -1 Telegram R.27. From political Resident at Kuwait.

From - The Hon'TDle Lieut .-Colonel T.C.j?owle,C.B.K., Political Resident in the ^ersian Gulf, To His Majesty ! s Secretary of Stat^ for India, The India Office London Sir pi r { I ' ' In continuation of my telegram No.T/184, dated the 20th December 1934, copy forwarded to the Government of India under Printed Letter No .C-321 of same date, I hctve the honour to express my views on His Excellency Sir i ^ancis Bumphr,ys , despatch Ho .711(90/99/34), dated the 16th December 1934, to His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. X* In regard to the figures set out in paragraphs 3-6 of Sir Francis Kumphrys , despatch, which cover the loss alleged by the Iraqi Customs Department to have been caused to Iraq by smuggling from Kuwait, two comments occur to me. First - that by no means all the contraband goods captured by the Iraq Customs are intended for Iraq, a certain portion of it is probably intended to be re-smuggled into Persia from Iraq. Second. With reference to the comparison between Kuwait and Iraq of average import per head. Colonel Dickson informed me that the population of Kuwait including the tribesmen is perhaps nearer 70,000 than 60,000. He also pointed out that since Kuwait - unlike Iraq - grov/s no grain whatever in its limits, naturally the imports lor the use of the local population must be considerably higher. However, /-2- However, I do not think timt it would really serve any useful purpose to enter into an argument regarding these figures. If the Iraq Government are convinced that they lose large sums annually by smuggling from Kuwait then - since they are the party most affected - from a practical point of view that is the end of the matter. 2. With reference to the suggestion for a comerence made in paragraph 16 of Sir Erancis Humphrys* despatch. I saw certain objections (vide paragraph 6 of my letter No.258-S, dated the 1st March 1934, copy forwarded to the Goverment of India and to His Excellency The Ambassador, Bagdad, under my Printed Letter Mo.269-S of same date)to a previous sugges tion that Colonel Dickson and myself should attend a confer ence at Bagdad, but at any rate we were to be duly authorised by the Shaikh (of Kuwait) to appear on his be hall'. The present suggestion, as I understand it, is that without authorisation from the Shaikh, or without even informing him. Colonel Dickson as Political Agent Kuwait and myself as Political Resident should confer officially with the i^mbassy and with officials of a foreign governiuent - , Iraq, whom the Shaikh regards with intense suspicion, on a matter which closely concerns Kuwait. That over the head of the Shaikh we should decide what terms the Iraq Government should offer him. That these terms should then be communicated to His Majesty's Government who would inform the Shaikh accordingly 3. My objections to a conference of this nature are very strong indeed. Briefly it would place Colonel Dickson and myself, particularly myself, in a most awkward position. It is part of my duties as Political Resident on behalf of His Majesty's Government to look after the interests of the Shaikh, /Skaikh, and ii I were to attend, a conference such as suggested I am sure, from my knowledge of his character, that he would be genuinely of the opinion that unaer the orders of His Majesty's Government Colonel Dickson and I had conferred with the Iraq Government to his disadvantage, and that he had been ignored both by His Majesty's Government and by the Iraq Govern ment. The Shaikh is not unnaturally sensitive of his independ ent position vis k vis Iraq, (he was not a little upset because the visit of the Iraqi representatives to Kuwait in September 1934 was arranged without his knowledge), and the result of such a conference would be not to render the Shaikh any more willing to accept the Iraqi terms, but to make Colonel Dickson and myself appear as allies of the Iraq Government. It is hardly necessary for me to point out what an undesirable effect this impression would have on our general position in Kuwait or on Colonel Dickson* s and my influence with the Shaikh in regard to the many matters on which we have to approach him on behalf of His Majesty's Government. Nor would the psychological effects of the conierence stop at Kuwait* I am afraid that such a conference would tend to confirm the Iraq Government in their impression, which it is most important for us to eradi cate on the widest possible grounds 7 that the Huler of Kuwait is a petty Shaikh, and not - juridically - an independent Sovereign, 4. In the paragraph under reference of his despatch His Excellency writess M It would be desirable thereiore that the Representatives of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf should come to the proposed conference armed with suggestions which, in the light of their personal experience, are such as could fairly be put to the Shaikh.In this connection /connection I must point out that even if I were to attend the suggested conference it would be quite impossible for me to say what proposals could •fairly 1 be put to the Shaikh by the Iraq Government• It does not seem to me that any question of fairness enters into this matter which is one of policy and expediency between the two parties concerned; the Iraq Government and the Shaikh. It is for the Shaikh to say, having regard to all the circumstances as they affect him and his State, (of which naturally he is the best judge), to what extent he is prepared to meet the Iraqi proposals, and this is not a responsibility which I can take off his shoulders. 6. I quite realise that the considerations which I have put forward above would naturally not have occurred to His Excellency. Such considerations would only have been apparent from my point of view, and if I have stressed them somewhat it is merely with a view to explaining as clearly as possible how undesirable a conference on the proposed lines would be as far as I am concerned. Should the Iraqi officials be eliminated from the conference it is hardly necessary for me to say that I shall be only too pleased to visit Bagdad, in company with Colonel jJickson, for a conversation with His Excellency at any time convenient to him* 6. with regard to course (b) in paragraph 10, and para graph 12, of Sir Francis Humphrys' despatch, to the general effect that His Majesty^ Government might consider the possibility of intervening and bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh in his own interests. Personally I am of opinion that the days are definitely past when we can regard the Shaikhs of the Arab Coast, at any rate the more important of them, as if they were minors to be made to do this or that, /X 8. / -5- that, against tiieir will, for their own good, 'ike Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf, like all other Oriental Hulers, have now grown up, and where their own interests only are concerned our action snould be limited to giving them friendly advice, where, however, important interests of His Majesty^ Government are at stake,then from the point oi view or practical politics there is no need lor us to refrain from exercising suck pressure as is possible. In the present instance it does not appear to me that such interests arise, and the Shaikh - from this aspect of the case - can very well be left to look after his own interests without the intervention of Hie Majesty's Government. 7. The shaikh's views of his own interests in the present instance are categorically expressed in the enclosure (ii ^ctract and whether he is really as indifferent to the prospect of Iraqi Customs control, or Blockade, as he makes out, 1 think his feelings on the subject - which are somewhat as follows - are not unreasonable. Comparing Saudi Arabia with Iraq what the Shaikh feels is that Ibn Saud has himself instituted his own blockade measures, and has not tried to saddle him - the Shaikh - with any responsibility in the matter. The Iraqi Government on the other hand seek to make up for t. e deficiencies in their customs control by high-handed ana illegal acts by which they hope to force him - the Shaikh - to do part of their work for them. The measures which the Iraqi Government propose will, in the opinion of the Shaikh, infringe on his position of an independent Ruler, and damage the trade and prosperity of his town, and if these measures are taken with his consent and co-operation he will have to face a serious and perhaps a dangerous wave of unpopularity from his people. from Kuwait Intelligence Summary) to His ii^ccellency's despatch.9. / ■T) ~6~ 8. It is the factor inaicated in the last sentence of tlie preceding paragraph wiiich I suggest aierits tke close attention of His Majesty's Government# Briefly^ since British interests are not involved) if Kuwait is to suffer loss from any Customs or Blockade measures instituted by the Iraq Govern ment it is in my opinion absolutely essential that His Majesty's Government should not in the eyes of either the Shaikh or his people bear any responsibility for such loss. Should however His Ivsgesty's Government by bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh succeed in making him againfilpis will accept some, or all, of the Iraqi proposals, tnen this is exactly the situation which will arise, we shsa .ll have to bear the ensuing odium, and it is unnecessary for me to dilate (I have already touched on this aspect of the question in paragraph 7 of my letter Ho •1046 -3 of 20th 1-fovember 1934 to His excellency Sir Francis Humphrys, copy forwarded to His Majesty's Secretary of State xor India and to the Government oi India under my Printed Letter No.1047-S of same date)on the harmful and probably lasting effects which thds will have on our prestige and influence not only in Kuwait| but in the other Arab States. On the other hand if Kuwait suffers (1) either by the Shaikh on the balance of advantages accepting without pressure from us the Iraqi proposals, or (2) by the Shaikh refusing to accept these proposals, and by the Iraqi Government instituting strict customs control or Blockade, then no responsibility rests on Kis Majesty's Government. Whatever feeling exists in Kuwait will be entertained in the case of (1) against the Shaikh alone and in the case of (2) against the Iraqi Government.9• In paragraph 12 of his despatch His Excellency writes: 'He (the Iraqi Minister xor Foreign Affairs) hinted, however, (and I cannot but feel that he is right), that if large numbers of preventive officials and possibly police and troops are post ed along the frontier, they will naturally work as near as possible to the centre of the smuggling activity, anu the number of clashes is likely to increase rather thun diminish.' This ^int 1 appears to me somewhat in the nature ox' a veiled threat, but whether this be so or not personally I am inclined to thinK that the effect v/ould be rather the contrary, ^hat Nuri Pasha euphemistically calls^clashes' have been the illegal and high handed encroachments of Iraqi Customs and Police into the terri torial waters and territory of Kuwait, such encroachments being made to make up for the lack of a proper customs control. Cnce this is established under a responsible Iraqi officer, whatever nuy be the loss to Kuwait trade, t&amp;ere will be much less reason for the Iraqi Customs officials to indulge in 'clashes 1 '. No such incidents occur on the Kuwaiti-Saudi frontier where Ibn Saud has established an organized and legal, however vexatious, control, and surely it is not too much to expect that the Iraqi ■ Government should be capable of exercising the same control over their Customs officials as the Saudi Government does over theirs. 10. The situation now is that for the last two years and more Sir francis Hun^hrys - ii I may say so - has laboured incessant ly at Bagdad, and I have done my best at Kuwait in seconding his efforts, to try and bring the two parties to some sort of amicabUe agreement. We have failed, and trough no fault of our own. This being so, and taking all the arguments put forward above into account, I see nothing for it but to let matters come to a head. I suggest therefore that I be authorised to address the Shaikh /^haikii a letter to tiie following effect: ^ (a) Kecapitulation of proposals or Iraq Goveniment as in (b) Hecapitulation of measures wkich it is understood the Siiaikh is willing to pat into ex feet as in 4 (b) (c) That 1 have heara from His Excellency The Ambassador at Bagdad that these measures from the point of view of the Iraqi Government do not go nearly far enough , and that if he - the Shaikh - is not prepared to make any advance on them the Iraq Government may be forced to put into effect certain counter-measures. (Those summarised in paragraph 2 of Sir Francis Humphrys 1 despatch. If I am authorised to write to tne Shaikh I would be grateful for a further communication from His Excellency indicating what I can say to the Shaikh as representing exacxly the intentions of the Iraq Government). (d) That the measures threatened by the Iraq Government are all legal, and if they are put into force His Majesty^ Government will not be able to assist the Shaikh. (e) That in these circumstances does the Shaikh wish to make any advance on his present proposals or not? 11. I cannot say what the Shaikh's reply will be but it is possible that faced with the threat of serious consequences from the Irag Government he may be prepared to meet them half way. 12. In conclusion I should like to point out that the divergence between His Excellency^ views and mine is really not / 4 (a) of my letter No.l046 -S of 20th November 1934 of my letcer of 20th November-9- not so wide as it appears. I am strongly opposed to Van suggested conference for reasons whick I am sure Eis Excellency will appreciate. I do not think that it is necessary for His Majesty's Government to bring pressure to bear on tne Shaikh in his own interests, and in His Majesty's Government's interests it seems to me that there are grave objections to any such pressure being applied. On the other hand I exrtirely concur with Sir i^rancis Humphrys in his most important proposal i.e. that the Shaikh should be warned that if he does not see his way to make an advance on his present proposals the Iraq Govern ment may put into force certain measures which will have serious consequences for him and his State, and since these measures will all be legal His Majesty's Government will net be able to assist him. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Lixcellency The Ambassador at Bagdad and the rolitical Agent| Kuwait.

I confess I felt no little anxiety as to the outcome of that letter, especially that part which dealt with Nuri Pasha's veiled threat that n if large numbers of preventive officials and possibly Police and troops were posted along the frontier, they will naturally work as near as possible to the centre of the smuggling activity, and the number of clashes is likely to increase rather than diminish'. 4. There is little doubt from the above wording that Nuri Pasha envisages the sending of armed forces right into Kuwait territory, so as to get as close to Kuwait Town as Possible. 5. Your letter deals effectively, I think,with this dangerous and rather bombastic suggestion, and I fully concur with all you have said by way of reply.

We realise that Fowled objections to proposed conference are in some respects similar to those urged in his despatch No.258-S of March 1st 1934 and over-ruled by His Majesty's Government (vide your telegram ^o.1716 of July 10th, 1934)» But in this case objections appear to us much stronger since Fowle and Dickson will be acting without authority of Shaikhs Their position with Shaikh would therefore, as argued by Fowle, be greatly prejudiced and Shaikh would be pre-disposed to resist any proposals put to him by His Majesty's Government as result of conference. The action recommended in paragraph 10 of Fowle's despatch seems to us on the other hand calculated to bring home to Shaikh possible dangers of his present attitude and likely toevoke some spontaneous response in the shape of concrete proposals for greater co-operation by Kuwait. This is obviously preferable to situation in which Fowle would present him with proposals agreed upon over his head and ^ i practically order him to accept them. Should Fowle f s proposed communication have no effect it will only remain for Iraq to take effective measures themselves to stop ; smuggling by land and Shaikh can have no cause for complaint. -FORSIGN- (Copy forwarded to P .A.Kuwait under P.

Subject ; Kuvi/aiti-Iraq Smuggling. I &gt; ' Sir, p In continuation of my letter No.27-3, dated the 8th January 1935, I have the honour to state that His ^xcelxency Sir Franc is Humphrys has paid me a visit here and that we have discussed the question of Kuwaiti-Iraq smuggling at some length. Taking into consideration all the various factors involved, which have been set forth in our respective despatches, we are of opinion that the best course of action to pursue is as follows. A- &gt; / 2. That I should address a letter to the Shaikh of Kuwait on the lines indicated in paragraph 10 of my letter quoted above, with the alterations indicated below. (a) as in my letter. (b) As in my letter. (c) As in my let er down to 'counter-measures' 1 . The actual measures, some or all of which the Iraq Government may be forced in their own defence to put into effect would be enumerated generally as follows: (1) Total prohibtion of imports from Kuwait. (2) The strengthening of the armed forces patrolling the land frontier of Iraq. (3) Severe restrictions upon the entry into Iraqi waters of Kuwaiti craft, and(4) The withdrawal of the valuable customs concessions at present extended to Kuwaiti commerce. In the last named category are included the privileges oi export oi goods from Iraq to Kuwait out of bond and under drawback free of customs and excise duty, and the concessions admissible to goods in transit, all of which privileges can be restricted or withdrawn by Government Regulations. (d) As in my letter. (e) as in m^ letter. (f) (New). That if the Shaikh is prepared to consider making any advance on his present proposals the following are measures which His Excellency has reason to believe might be acceptable to the Iraqi Government; (1) The appointment of an experienced British Director of Customs at Kuwait, preferably from India, with an adequate staff# one half of the cost of the Director and the staff would be defrayed by the Iraqi Govern ment on the understanding that the Director would work in the closest co-operation with the Iraqi Customs Department. Ke would send copies of all export licences for goods leaving Kuwait by land or sea to the Iraqi Customs Department and furnish all informa tion reasonably required by the Department for use in the prevention of smuggling. (2) The import of certain articles into Kuwait to be restricted to an annual quota. These commodities are those on which a higher rate of duty is charge able and which are known to be smuggled into Iraq in great quantity. The Iraqi Government should have power to require the Shaikh to add other commodities to the schedule should smuggling ox them become rife. Sugar Tea Matches Coffee Tobacco &amp; Cigarettes Cigarette paper It /I i4 **0** \y It is suggested that the import quota should be lixed on a per capita basis and that the amount per capita imported into Iraq where the stanaard or living is at least as high as it is in Kuwait, should be regard ed as a fair consumption per capita for Kuwait. The quota should be for such quantities as would be sufficient to allow for the consumption in Kuwait, of the amount of the Iraqi per capita import by each inhabitant of Kuwait. In addition to this the Kuwaiti customs would be empowered to issue import licences for quantities in excess of the quota required for the legitimate export trade. Such additional imports would not exceed 10 per cent of the quota and would only be issued after enquiry had elicited that the goods were required for licit commerce. Copies of all such import certificates would be sent to the Iraqi Customs. (3) A joint Kuwaiti-Iraq preventive service should be . ' ' established, with power to operate within defined cl/&gt;. ISl limits in the territories of both States, on land and sea. Both States would be represented in the force, which would work in close liaison with both Customs .administrations. 3. Addition (f in my letter would be put to the Shciikh merely as a suggestion from His .excellency The i ^mbassador through me. Any impression of pressure, therefore, would be removed, and the responsibility for its acceptance or rejection would rest entirely on the Shaikh and in no way on His Majesty's Government, which was the main principle underlying the argu ments set forth in my despatch quoted above. 4. With regard to (f). There is a further proposal (4) which /-4- LA w- which is as follows: In order to reimburse the Shaikh nominally for his expenses in connection with the joint preventive serviee and other measures (but actually to compensate him lor losses which he may suffer by the introduction of these arrange- ments) the Iraqi Government will pay him a lump sum anuually* This measure, however, will not oe communicated to the Shaikh in my letter. / - 6• In addition to the Iraqi proposals in (f), there is anuther which the Shaikh might himself put forward: i.e. one on the lines 01 that which he made to Ibn Baud some time ago vide my despatch Ho.44 (767-S to Government of India), dated 27th June 1933 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, i.e. that the Iraq Government should keep a certain number of Customs posts on the Kuwaiti-Iraq frontier, and that the Shaikh would guarantee that all caravans leaving; Kuwait should ^as^. through these posts# Sir Francis Humphrys and I, however, are oi opinion that, since it is doubtful whether the Iraqi Government would agree to this proposal, it would be better lor it to emanate from the Shaikh, and it seems not unlikely that he may make it of his own accord since he referred to it in tae enclosure to His Sxcellenny's despatch No.711, dated the 16th jecember 1934, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 6.

International responsibility of stopping this rests primarily with Iraq Government, see my despatch No.708. Smugglers appear in most if not all cases to be organised in Basrah (Ogilvie-Forbes 1 telegram 55-Saying) while it is clear that existing preventive organisation on land frontier is quite inadequate (compare Bushire despatch dated 20th November). Prima facie step suggested by Political Resident in paragraph 6 of his despatch dated 20th November would go far to meet the case. What, if any, are the Iraq objections to taking action on these lines ? I appreciate danger that their posts may develop into blocKade but this should be lessened if posts were established on the lines suggested by Bushire as part of general friendly arrangements. 5. I think best course will be that you should ?discuss informally with Mr.Sievwright and Iraq Government settlement as regards land smuggling on above lines but without of coarse in any way committing His Majesty 1 s Government or Shaikh ?regardin^ appointment of Director of Customs which however, subject to Residents comments. His Majesty^ Government will press on Shaikh. Director if appointed could operate system of manifests in regard to goods consigned to overland frontier which, taking preventive measures referred to in paragraph 4 above should in my opinion enable Iraq to establish effective control without any limitation of imports into Kuwait (to which there would be objection) without transgression over Kuwait border and without payment of compensation to Shaikh (save ?c03t in respect of salary of Director of Customs). 6. Matter is very urgent and I shall be very grateful for earliest possible comments. If no settlement proves practicable on above lines it may be necessary to fall back on procedure /-3- i ^ I v6 'A / procedure proposed in Bushire despatch iro«27-S of January 8th but His Majesty's Government are most reluctant to risk consequences suggested in paragraph 2 of your despatch No.7ll unless this is quite inevitatie. / n ' / / • -Secretiiry of State for Foreign Affairs - (Copy forwarded to P.A.Kuwaat under ]?.L.

Humphrys and Messrs. Hogg, Sievwright, Bateman and Stafford was briefly as follows 1. That the Iraqi Government would not put forward any further detailed proposals for the co-operation of the Shaikh in tne prevention of smuggling, as the Shaikh had not furn- ished an^ considered reply to the scheme placed 'before him b;y tne Iraqi delegation which visited him in September last. ^hat the Advisers to the Government have prepared a scheme of which the following are the main principles. These principles, subject to agreement later on details and the figures of quotas and compensation, have been accepted by His Majesty s Embassy as being fair and reasonable measures which the Shaikh should accept in order to retain the amity of Iraq (a; The appointment of an experienced British Director of Customs at Kuwait, preferably from India, with an adequate staff. One half of the cost of the Director and the staff would be defrayed by the Iraqi Government on the understanding that the Director would worK in the closest co-operation with the Iraqi Customs Department, lie would send copies of all export licences for goods leaving Kuwait by land or sea to the Iraqi Customs Depart ment and furnish all information reasonably required by the Department for use in the prevention of smuggling. (b) 1he import of certain articles into Kuwait to be restricted to an annual quota. These commodities are those on which a high fixed rate of duty is chargeable / andI - ** ~ 9 — b 3 and which are known to be smuggled into Iraq in great quantity. The Iraqi Government should have power to require the Shaikh to add other commodities to the schedule should smuggling of them become rife. Sugar Coffee Tobacco and Cigarettes Matches Cigarette Paper It is suggested that the import quota should be fixed on a per capita oasis and that the amount per capita imported into Iraq, where the standard of living is at least as high as it is in Kuwait, should be regarded as a fair con sumption per capita for Kuwait. The quota should be for such quantities as would oe sufficient to allow for the consumption in Kuwait of the amount of the Iraqi per capita import by each inhabitant of Kuwait. In addition to this the Kuwaiti Customs would be empowered to issue import J. icenses for quantities in excess of the quota required for the legitimate export trade. Such additional imports would not exceed 10 per cent of the quota and would only be issued after enquiry had elicited that the goods were required lor licit commerce. Copies of all such import certificates would be sent to the Iraqi Customs* (c) A Joint Kuwaiti-Iraqi preventive service should be established, with power to operate within defined limits in uhe territories of both States, on land and sea. Both States would be represented in the force, which would work in close liaison with both Customs Administrations. oi' (d) In order to reimburse the Shaikh nominally for his expenses in connection with the joint preventive service and other measures (but actually to compensate him for losses (si /whi cheiftt t)\j f 'iff. . v; jv &gt;I2 J to e; o;- dB ii^ : 4 r noij,,. f ilKWP0:' C ^ 'oij ■jX'S.IM I fe ' ;' iiwi:..

(1) As regards (c) above, there is a precedent (viz. the Finnish-Swedish Agreement of December 29th, 1933). It is clear that the Shaikh would suffer no loss of prestige or sovereignty in agreeing under this head, (2) There is urgent need for the Shaikh to adopt a definite attitude at once towards these proposals, Iraqi merchants are complaining everywhere of being undercut by the prices of goods smuggled from Kuwait and business is in a chaotic state. Questions are being raised in Parliament, and failing a move by the Shaikh, the Iraqi Government will be obliged by public pressure to take stringent measures to stop smuggling. This will entail expenditure which must be provided in the budget estimates and that means a decision before March 31st one way or the other, (3) As a preliminary measure the Iraqi Government will no doubt withdraw the valuable customs privileges enjoyed at present by Kuwait.

In 1934 there were 1041 cases of ishich only 87 were by sea. Land smuggling is generally increasing. The value of smuggled goods actually captured in ^raq last year amounted to approximately £15,000/- the duty on which would have been £10,000/- The goods included 200 tons of sugar and one and a half million boxes of matches. I was recently in- -formed by a representative of Swedish Match Company that his flirm is exporting yearly equal quantities of feoods to Basra and Kuwait and he estimates that 90% of _J__ would be smuggled into Iraq# Owing to underselling of goods smuggled from Kuwait trade in some parts of Iraq is becoming stagnant and pressure is being brought on Government\ Z* Gove rime nt to take active steps to prevent smuggling. Hie Government are aware that responsibility of stopping smuggling rests with them but they are convinced that pre - -ventive courses open to tiiem will not be effective without Shaikh* s cooperation. y ^ ^ ^ The measures suggested in my despatch lio# 72 are the result of two years^hard thinking by iraci Government and form an interlocking system which theyfeel should be I accepted as a whole. 'ttiey have made it clear that they are willing to reimburse Shaikh for any loss or expense I rfyft (jf ) which he may incur in adopting these proposals* I iki .va discussed with British Advisers of Iraq Government modified system proposed in your telegram Ko. 47 with a view to ascertaining, if put forward by Shaikh, it would be acceptable to Iraq Uovernment. i can now say defi- -nitely that it would be unacceptable and that unless Shaikh is approached at once and puts forward proposals similar to those outlined in my despatch no. 72 Iraq Uovermrjent will be obliged to adopt coercive measures and to apply for budgetary provision for necessary materiel before March 3lst next# '7. Iraq Government have satisfied themselves that 'manifest* proposals of Shaikh are quite inadequate^ supported by actual inspection of each load which leaves Kuwait by land or sea* Dumps of contraband are known to exist . in Bubiyan and Warbha islands and in &gt; Even export license system which they suggested would be equally effective unless based on a quota system of legitimate im- -ports. Stouggled goods from Kuwait are now reaching direct places as far,, as K.erbela and Ramadi. fhis means that ___ a bldckade of 100 miles of land frontier motor and sero- -plane patrols based on points d'appui ^preferably at water- -holes indesertj and support by mobile forces echeloned in must cover at least 400 miles.3. railaa* is mtural that Iraq Government should shrink from incurring expense of such a system and that they should favour concentration on a shorter land frontier of Kuwait. It is probably even if such blockade is institu-' -ted that Kuwaitis endeavour to slip out from South into JNejd and smuggle goods iaitoasa^ck across frontier from JJiejd. Iraq Government are prepared to face this risk and if necessary to endeavour to negotiate a sim- -ultaneous agreement with Jiiejd. They also contemplate cutting off iiuwaiVs water supply in order to induce Shaikh to come to terms• Prom above it will be seen that patience of Iraq Government is now exhausted. They had not thought of bringing Kuwait into a customs unit or into their political orbit but the are determined to put an end to a situation ' i which has brought them much unpopularity with trading conmuni- -ty and ever inreasing losses to their sustoms. They have invoked His Majesty's Government to bring Shaikh to reason and sincerely desire to settle this question by friendly cooperation rather than by coercive measures. They now wish it to be understood that unless Shaikh puts forward e some reasonable sooperative shheme without delay steps will be taken to institute a strict blockade of his territory.

KUWAIT-IRAQ SMUGGLING. Only course of action appears to be that agreed on by Eumphrys and myself in paragraph 2 of my letter of 2nd February No•IVS-Sji.e. for me to be authorised to address the suggested letter to the Shaikh which will now have to be modified as follows: (a) Paragraph 2 (c). Strengthening of wording to effect that unless Shaikh agrees to proposals Iraq Government definitely intend to impose blockade vide last paragraph of Bagdad telegram of 19th February No.47 to Foreign Office. (b) Paragraph 2 F.(2). No quota, which is objection able to His Majesty^ Goverrment vide paragraph 6 of Foreign Office telegram of 9th February No»47 to Bagdad. (c) Paragraph 2 F.(3) as modified in my telegram of 8th February No.186 provided Iraq Government agree to this modification which Humphrys will doubtless confirm. (d) Addition to Iraq counter measures that they will stop Kuwait boats getting water from Shatt al Arab vide penultimate paragraph of the Bagdad telegram of 19th February. 2. I would be grateful if (see paragraph 4r below) Humphrys could write to me to Kuwait giving me exact wording of (a) minimum demands of Iraq Government which I am ~~ authorised /7. / authorised by His Majesty's Government to put to Shaikh and (b) counter measures which failing Shaikh's acceptance Iraq Government intend to impose• 3. I quite appreciate position and feelings of Iraq authorities but even from their point of view I do not under stand why they should wish to jump suddenly from practically no preventive measures at all (vide paragraph 6 (a) of my letter of 20th November) to complete and expensive blockade etc- It seems to me (though this is a matter of which of course Humphrys is the best judge) that they could budget for this blockade and try the cheaper methods suggested in my paragraph just quoted combined with posts on frontier (para graph 6 of my letter of 2nd February) if Shaikh did agree to this- If after trial smuggling did not materially decrease they could proceed to more drastic measures. If I am authorised to write the letter to Shaikh I propose visiting Kuwait by mail of 4th March to present letter and talk matter over with him. 5. I venture to point out once again (vide paragraph 8 of my letter of 8th January) that even if the Shaikh accepts Iraqi proposals Kuwait trade will inevitably suffer, and that we should definitely avoid giving the impression to Kuwait and the other Arab Shaikhs that these proposals were accepted under pressure from us* It is possible that the Shaikh as the choice i of two evils may accept the Iraqi proposals and in that case will be ohly too glad if we give him any excuse to shelter himself behind the pretext that they were forced on him by us. 6. After my seeing the Shaikh I suggest that he might visit Efegdad vide paragraph 3 of your telegram of 8th February No.415 where it is possible that behind the scenes .he may obtain better terms for himself though I have not much hope of this.-3- 7o) ?• Reference paragraph 4 of your telegram of 8th February Ko*415.

Your paragraph 1 (a) . To any criticism that may be levelled at us under this heading whether at home or out here we have an excellent reply. That in this matter m which British interests were not directly involved and which was therefore the Shaikh's own responsibility we gave him strong advice to offer a measure of co-operation which he refused to do (if this is his final attitude). To the converse criticism: that we applied pressure on the anaikh to accept Iraqi proposals in Iraqi interests it seems to me we have no reply at all. 2, Your paragraph 3 (c). Shaikh s conduct ^.ot irreproachable'. It is true that he was stupid over the suggested Bagdad conference of February 1934 (vide ''U correspondence ending with my Express Letter N0.192-S of 20th February 1934) but his actual conduct vis a vis Iraq bas been studiously correct. Under International Law he is not bound to co-operate with the Iraq Government - vide for instance Foreign Office despatch No .730 of 12th y 0 November 1934 to Bagdad. In spite of this the Iraq Customs Authorities have for the last three years pursued a deliberate /deliberate policy of a succession of illegal high-handed and brutal acts which have involved the ill-treatment wounding and killing of Kuwaiti subjects with the obvious aim of bullying the Shaikh into co-operation ♦ If the Shaikh had taken the law into his own hands (he has half-a-dozen armed Ford vane'Loes) or encouraged his people to do so and Iraqi Customs guards had been shot His Majesty's Government would have had a very serious r situation on their hands» The Shaikh however has quite correct ly merely made protests through His Majesty's Government. So far no reparation whatever has been forthcoming from the Iraq Government• I fear under these circumstances that the phrase 'not irreproachable 11 would appear to the Shaikh as at lea.st illogical and I suggest that I be allowed to tone it a own • ! 3. Your paragraph o# (a) 'Serious view of his failure to do so'* In all the circumstances I would much prefer to say that Eis Majesty's Government took a serious view of the situation cr something of that sort. (b) 'Incurred their displeasure'. I am oi opinion this would do harm rather than good as giving the public impression that the Shaikh was a martyr. What I have in mind (if the Shaikh does not agree to co.operate) is to let it be known nut only in Kuwait but all along the Arab Coast (where the affair will arouse considerable comment) that^tne Shaikh aas acted against His Majesty's Government's advice in not adopting a measure of co r operation which appears reasonable to tiiem ana that therefore naturally thejr can acaept no responsibility for the result. I hold no particular brief for the Shaikh whose conduct on various occasions in the past has been irritating. , I feel however that in the present matter a rebuke from His Majesty's Government which would seem to him unmerited would lessen /lessen the effect of the censure in the case of Traders (still to come from His Majesty^ Government vide my letter No.C-323 of 21st December 1934) in which he was definitely at fault. 5. I do not reach Kuwait until 5th March and do not leave until 9th March so His Majesty's Government have time for considering the points put forward above which do not affect the text of the letter to be given to the Shaikh but merely the conversation which I am to have with him later. -.Resident' 3 /V^ 3 y53/33 Telegram XX Prom His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, London» His Majesty*s Ambassador, Bagdad, by Foreign Office, Ho.77 Repeated by His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, to* Government of India, foreign and Political Department, New Delhi, No,677, Political Resident, Bushire, No.678, Political Agent, Kufrait, No.679.
