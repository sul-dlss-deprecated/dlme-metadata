On April 20th,a fight took plave in the Bazaar between a Najdi &amp; a JJersian.Both ¥?ere of the cooly class. All the Najdis in the Bazaar collected armed with sticks &amp; missiles &amp; injured the Persian and another who caEio to his assistance .They also beat the Police who endeavoured to arrest the ringleaders. The fracas occurred just outside the Office of Abdulla ^osaibi,the Najd Agent here,who however saw fit to bolt his door 5b faake no effort to control the Ilajdis. Subsequently Khan Bahadur Muhaaraad Sharif,who is in charge of the Municipality arrived on the scene with fiiore police &amp; succeeded in arresting four only, of the largo crowd of Najdis asseiabled. I referred the case to the Oadhi to taice evidence &amp; report.The latter took certain evidence ^ roquosted that the case sight be postponed till the victims of thu assault had sufficiently recovered to give evidence.He also recoiunended that the accused be rele sed Meanwhile ,provided a suitable 1 Kafil* was forthcoiiing.Having ascertained froia the doctor that the condition of the injured nen.one of whom was at first reported to be dangerously ill,was such that there was no likelihood of very serious results,! released the accused after taking a written 'Kifaleh* fron Abdulla Qosaibi. Shortly after this Qosaibi wrote me a letter accueing K.B. lluhaiasiad 3harif of having brought police &amp; of having beaten Najdis &amp; acted in a high-handed runner.He added that the affair was of no iKiportance &amp; that had he been present he would have intervened &amp; stopped it at onGe ,instod of using force as 11.Sharif had done. Later he caiae to see me &amp; then admitted that he had shut himself in his office as ' he thought the aff4±T\ as not one in which he need interfere* I said his action was not consistent vith what he had written &amp; I thought that it was a )ity that he had rotused Ijis Influence vfith the ITaJdis to stop the fracas before it becaxie general. He had no sooner left ny Office than a deputation of Persians appeared..They cane to object to my action in releasing the accused.I explained the situation^ that in accordance with the r&gt;hara recoaaendation I had taken 1 Kifaleh' before releasing thffE. &amp; received a written report from the doctor that the injured -aen wore not in any danger. I added, that in pant years,whenever an accused person had been arrested during RnMadhan,they had alnost Invariably prayed, for his release pendiajj nearing of the case,^ moreover in say preliainary enquiries from the Police they were uncertain whether the four individuals arrested frosa araong the crowd of Uajdifl were actaully guilty of assault,which could only be determined by the '^adhi after tak ing all the evidence. They appeared satisfied.There aro however, nmours that sosae of the hot-heads have wired to Ttfharan professing to be in terror of attacks froia ITa^dis. I was infonred that there are a number of witnesses,including Indians,to the fact that oosaibi appeared at the beginning of the fracas &amp; urged the Ilejdis to beat the Persians &amp; then retired into his offici &amp; bolted the door. . It is certain that while the fracas was in progress the flajdis continual ly shouted f long live Bin Sau^ 1 &amp; similar reiuarlcs. It will prosiuoably com* out in the evidence before the ^dh^what Qosaibi f 3 attitude really v;as # but whether or not he urged tha IIaJdi f s on, he cannot be said, in his capacity of Bin Saud's agent to have actod at all creditably.He appears to be adopting the attitude in this case,as in some others of less importance which ha e recently occurred,that Hajdis are above the Law.

Am I authorised to tell Bin Saud flatly that rc will not tolerate the presence of Ca-aibi or any other Hejdi agent in Bahrain, and will deport him to Al Ahsa, unlesa he confines his activities to merely comrercial ends and refrains from interfering with adminiatrative official matters.

But should Abdul Aziz al Qusaibi show signs of becoming more truculent you might, if you see no objection, write to Bin Saud drawing attention to his letter dated the 29th July 1920 to Major Dickson, in which he expressed his gratitude to His Majesty's Government for undertaking to look after the welfare of his subjects residing in Bahrain, and adding that this be^ng so, and consequently Nejdis. being under jurisdiction of yourself as representative of His Majesty's Government ; you presume that Qusaibi is merely his business agent in Bahrain and as such shbuld i. not interfere in matters affecting the welfare of Najdis, for which the Political Agent is responsible. You might also suggest that it would improve matters considerably if Bin Saud would kindly make Qusaibi f s position in Bahrain quite clear to him, as lately he has shown signs of desiring to take more upon himself than he is entitled to. mt-col.. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Memo random » I have mentioned to you that the behavioar of the Saltan' of JJajd's agent here has somewhat unsatisfRctory.An incident has re cently occurnea from which it id fairly obvious the he places his personal considerations before those of Bin ^aad f and is inclined to abase his inflaence and the ase of Bin Saad's nfime. Shortly after I first arrived here .nearly all the merchants of Bahrain came and protested against a easterns regulation,by which all except ^osaibi and aboat one other Najd me rc hen t, we re prohibited from benifitting (ftrom the reduced customs charges on goods for transhipment to ^atif and Ojair. This in fact conferred on him the monopoly of the trade since noone else paying full customs rates could compete with him. On going into the matter I discovered thrt it was due to the customs officials having misunderstood instructions issued by, you, when the new scheme was introduced,and was obviously an error. The matter was therefore put right arid the reduced charges brought into force on all genuine transhipped consignments. This naturally affected Khan Bahadur ^08aibi,who came to me in a state of excitement and adopted a threatening tone and was altogether extremely rude. He said Bin Saud should hear about it &amp; he was sure he would not put up with it etc. I explained that the matter in no way affected Bin Saud except to stimulate trade and. competition as regards imports into Najd which . was highly to his benifit,and that under no circumstances could I admit Qosaibi to drag Bin Saud into Bahrain affairs purely because he personally did not like a customs regulation which was fair to all, and did not give him personally an unfair advanatge over others. He took the hint and since then has always been more polite f although as in the matter of the Palinurus 1 visit to Qatif,he seldom tries to help,A on that occasion would undoubtedly have put obstacles in the way,had I not personally gone to see the Amir of Qatif,a visit of which Qosaibi did not approve.He is not desirous of a port being ooenedon 'the mainland beo^use he h^s practically 'the monopoly o tns carrying trade between here at OJair and owns a number of boats* The brothers Qosadbi.one of whom lives in Hassa.one here .and one in ^ Bombay,have come into prominence only since the subsidy has been L paid to Bin Sand. They draw his subsidy and mange his money affairs, and in the lest few years have acquired great influence in Na^d snd • considerable wealth.Qosaibi now ranfcs only after Yttsuf Kanoo in wealth,and is rapidly gaining on him. There is little doubt that r ,B f Abdul Aziz Qob ibi aspires to become recognised as Bin Sand's Consul here .It is reported to me that lately the common ITaJdis here openly reifer to hi as uheii » Consul. Pahad A1 Ba33am,a well fcnown Najdi,said to me recently f Qosaibl f is above the law,he considers he is a consul 1 . About a fortnight ago,the servant of a Jfa^d merchant cj called Abdulla iiawas.ran way from his master and is said to have stolen some things.He went and slept in the Go-Down of Qosaibi. Abdulla Hawaa followed him there &amp; had an altercation, ciosaibi has long been on bad terms with A.H. and seized the opportunity to up- raid him.The following day they met in Yusuf iCanoo^ house and cjosaibi behaved badly and tried several times to strike A.E. bat ' as prevented .Meanwhile he had despatched his brother Hassan o v e a3.1 the Najdi rottfhd to come and beat A.H.

Both parties then wanted to oome to me to settle their dispute,bnt Y .r. persuaded them not to 4 In a half hearted way tried to patch up a peace which neither o&gt; rty agreed to. yosalbl then wrote off to Bin Jlluwl.and caused the latter to send some Fidawis and a letter to me asking me to ordex A. Hawas at once to proceed to Hassa. This put me in an invidious position.lt was believed here that when he got there he might be unjustly treated owing to the influence of the Qosaibi ? s,and moreovei * . to arrest a person.who In Bahrain Is under the protection of the ; Agency,on a matter which occurred In Bahraln.at the ordor of Bin - Jlluwl,would have heen tantamount to admitting that Bin Jlluwl was a sort of appellate Court and could at any time Interfere In Bahrain affairs. I tried to get over the dlf loulty hy patching up the■I - 4 ^ i- ^ I U tS 'i C i ^ 1 ' V ^ &gt;' quarrel but Qosalbi was most unreasonable and insfted on such humiliating terms that itnwas impossible for A. H, to agree.He further insisted that in any case A.H. must proceed to Hassa to propitiate Bin Jiluwi who was very angry with him f as he had insulted t . the Sultan's representative. I pointed out lih*t the quarrel was a personal one.and took place here t and that It was scar ^.t concoiva^ 0 that Bin Jiluwi should have a personal bias against either party un- mis- less the afflair had been represented to him,and in any case wouj-d surely be satisfied if both parties wrote that they had made peace, ^osaibi would in no way agree and as it was throughout obvious that his one desire was to get A.H. to Hassa where ha could ill treaj him, I thought it better to be clear ofttthe matt0r t and dropped Izi 1 wrote to Bin Jiluwi .that inasmuch as the affttrtoftlc place har^ and the parties had not officially approached me # but had of their own accord referred to him.I did not care to interferein any way.In all other matters I was always pleased to assist as he had had mole v proof in the past. It was further difficult for me tcr take part against one party only when I knew both to be t fault. After this Qosaibi got frightened,and ran about accusing everybody including myself of not having striven whole heartedly for peace. The only obstacle to peace was himself. By this time nobody would assist him and he was too proud to climb down by himself. Meanwhile A.Hawas wentx off of his own accord to Hassa to place his case before Bin Jiluwi.^saibi heMtd of this and sent a boat after him.They caught him at OJair publicly beat him and started him off to Hassa with a rope around his neck.This before any inquiry a.ad obviously at Qosaibls instigation. Everybody is very annoyed with Qosaibi,but as is clstomary no-one has the mor 1 courage to sey so. po 3 to his face so that he will probably assume th t public opinion is with him and be the more difficult to deal with in future. During conversation with him,he told me that I was BinSaud's »5aib' in Bahrain where Hajdi's were concerned^I disabused him of this &amp; said I was under the orders of yourself only f and afforded British protectionto Hajdis in Bahrain ,since Bin Sand had requested this freev a^d assistance of Govemment,which was renjtdered quite ^ I II at some inconvenience .purely out of friendship for Bin 3aud. He then admitted that Hajdla hare vould he In a sorry plight if not under British protection. I have reported this somwwkht domestic mattar lengtnily,becAus# it is not impossible that Qosaibi will try to w te Bin Jiluwi believ. he has heen lightly dealt with.and in eny case I rather anticipate that sooner or later the Political Agent here will have to have Qosaihi's position clearly defined and it might he well to hare this on record# Major.

It is well known to kour highness that the posit ion of Great Britain in Bahrain is peculiar. It dates far back beyond living memory but it will sulfice for my present purpose if 1 recall to Your ivigiaiesa* memory the fact that it w*a the British OoverniLent who, at a time of great fighting andamri jidorci©r quelled dldturbaao«a and oall#d dbaijtii Ida al Kiialita, tii«n a jriigitlve, to the ihalkbdoit ot Baiiraia fifty five years ago .

During t at long rule of fifty five yeura, it waa the British Government who maintwiined f on more than one oooasion by force of arm^ , Shaikh laa as Shaikh of Baiirciin and it is no secret that the protection of li±a Majesty's Government haa more than once helped Shaikh lsa f not only against external a^greaaion, but also agc^inst his cm sub jects the Baharinan who have long been seriously oppressed and thoroughly discontented* Many ti^ea also, notably against Persia and Turkey^ the British Government has specifically refused to permit the presence of foreign agents f other than its own Political Agent, in the islands of Bahrain* It founded its claim in this respect on the under- t&lt;aking given by Shaikh lea al Khalifah on his appointment as Shaikh in the year 1880 confirmed in 1892 when dhaikh isa distinctly undertook firstly f that he would on no account enter into any agreement or correa^ond ence^ otner than the British Government secondly, that, without the assent of tne British Gov ernment, he would not consent to tne reaidence within his territc&amp;y of the agent of any other Government. To obviate the Just complaints of foreigners against and misrule maladministration/on the part of the Shaikhs , which had led to these claims on the part of Persia and Turkey to have resident agents in Bahrain, the British Government was ob liged to bring pressure to bear on Shaikh Isa with the result that, on the 28th Jamadi II 1327 K., he confirmod to iiajor Mackenzie the working arrangement which had air ady commenoe# in the time of Major Prideaux by which c^aes concerning foreignersforeiga«ra were referred to tn# PoiitiOAi agent's Juriadlot- ion.

Tour Highness will be able to see what I clearly forsaw the minute the Bahrain files were placed before me that the Qasaibi recent aotivitiei were of the most dangerous and mischiewous kind and that the British GOTemment is cruite unable to admit any official protection of Hejada residing in Bahrain other than their own and it was for this reason that there was delay in the settling of the passport question, about which I am writing separately to Tour Majesty, that I was forced to direct Abdulla al Qasaibi to quit the islands on the pretence, made in Tour Highness interests and to preserre your good name and honour, that he was the bearer of important despatches from me to yourself• The ov ^stion has zu intrUiaic imDortanos which lies quite outside the relatiwely awall wttor of I&gt; €&gt; Ablulla*■ personal conduct or misconduct aad I must with flrmneBe Insist that the British Govemwent cannot, as 7*iuch out of regard to Your Highness 1 Interests as for many other Important reasons which I have endeavoured to set forth In this letter, approve officially the presence of any Rajdi Agent of Your Highness unless (1) that agent Is personally acceptable to the British GrOTernment (2) that he solemnly undertakes that he will not in any way Interfere In the administration of the islands whether on the pretence that Hajdi Interests, public or private (apart from his own private concerns and the private concerns of Your Highness) are engaged or for any other reason# One small matter I must reply to as It Is referred to by Your Highness and that is the Persian composition of th 1 municipal police force «nd this is true and I cannot say that no shots were fired by them said when the trouble arose between the two parties, the fireams were taken fror the police and they were dismissed from their functions until the trouble i qutted down# Then they returned to their duties# From this Your Majesty win perceive that we admit to a blemish in the majority of the police being Persians# This is a great regret to both the Political Agent and to the municipality, who would infinitely prefer that the police should be a mixed force, equally recruited from Persians, Hajdis and sunnls# Unfortunately It has been found impossible to enlist men from either of the two last named classes or If any such have en listed they have not remained in the service# Their enlist ment and faithful service would be welcome and rewarded* In conclusion let me assure Your Highn^ps that the Poli tical Agent, with the aeslstance of Sheikh Hamad, will spare no pains to do justice between the two contending parties in the recent riots# Casualties on both sides appear to have about been^equal and there should be no great difficulty in arriving at a compromise# The dispute out of which the trouble arose was of the most trifling character, the repairreuair of a watch of 8 value and the root trouble wafc-fell- grious fanatlolem at the trying period of the Ramazan fast# Helther the British Government nor the British political Agen were for one moaient indifferent to the trouble or faii^^-i to realise its gravity and the proof of this statement is that, although I myself with two warships hastened to the scene, before we were able to arrive.

No. 84-C dated 2oth J-jne , Syed Hashim was fairly clear that he desired the return of Abdulla as an indication to Bin Saud that his tinie with me at Bushire had not 'been entirely wasted from the point of view oi His High ness the Sultan. 1 think that we may well afford to give way in this little matter, and if Abdul la's return will save the face of the preat Abdul Aziz Bin Fa'ud , 1 find it diffic ult to resist so cheap a bargain. If he is obstreperous we can get him removed ago-i- 11 by formally complaining ol him to the Sultan. Your memorandum No. 85—C dated 26th June is a much more serious proposition. 1 have an idea that 1 heard some where that Bin Saud was considerably indebted and therefore in the hands of the Qasaibi family . The question , therefore , of whether it would he possible -to oust the i^osaioi influence altogether will very much depend on the Sultan's attitude to wards the family . 1 think you will H^gree with me that nothing would be more dangerous to Dr. Abdulla Saeed than that I should give a hint to the Sultan of Nejd that he would be a p«rsona grata . You will remember 'that we rather protestec against his receiving a decoration on that ground , and one knows exactly what theffe Oriental potentates are . 1 think we can only watch and wait in regard to Bin Saud's private agent- If Dr. Abdulla himself could manage to get nominated that would be quite a different thing.

He was siunHioned at once by the Kozaibia and severely reprimanded for having injured a subject of King Ibn Saoud. The action caused considerable comment in Bahrain as it was said that the Kozaibis assumed, in this case, the attitude of being the official protectors and representatives of Negd subjects in Bahrain. Mohamed Yatim was afterwards prosecuted by the Police and his driving licence wassuspended for 12 months on this charge and on a second charge of driving without a licence while the case was being e;xamined by the Police. He had been ordered not t« drive until the matter was settled. Today Shaikh Rashid bin Mohaaied bin Isa al Khalifa called on me with a message from his father Shaikh Mflihamed asking me to listen to his complaint and assist him. Shaikh Rashid lives in Rafaa. A few days ago he was out hunting and in his absence one of his house servants went to the public well to draw water. A servant from the Kozaibi house was at the well ana the two men had a slight argument, --atfer ohaikii xtaahitt'* visitea the well again to get water. Four men came from the house of the Kozaibi?, «ne of them armed with a rifle a revolver and a daggar. They took Shaikh Rashid's man, by force, tied him with a rope and put a rope round his neck and pulled him off to their house. ^here were a number of people present and many of them remonstrated with Kozaibis servants, but the four men said they had orders to do this. The Rafaa Arabs were very angry, most of them being followers of the Khalifa, and they wished to go and rescue the man by force but the Imam of the mosque and his sons managed to calm them. The Rafaa Arabs took the matter as being a deliberate insult to the Khalifa. The man was confined in Kozaibis house till night time and then released by orders of Abdel Aziz Kozaibi. Shaikh Rashid returned. He went at once to his father and complained. Shaikh Mohamed sent him to Shaikh hamed asking that the Kozaibis should be made to apologise at once. Shaikh Hamed said that he would ask Shaikh Sulman to deal with the matter. Shaikh Sulman sent for Hassan Kozaibi and apparently tola him very decidedly what he thought about it, and then told him to go to Shaikh Rashid and apologise. Since then the Kozaibis have taken no action. and his father after waiting several days for some have detirmined to take action and asked me to investigate. This I iaavc danc this subjects, the servant of Shaikh Rashid is a Hassawi ana zne Kozaicis' servants are Negdis. It is ■ - to apply ior a Shaikh Rashid move by the Kozaibis .^v^to ciive orders to the Police mornin^. Both parties are foreign Hassawi and the Kozaibis' Police will find it necessary likely that the warrant if so I should be -- - ^ postpone the case till the return of the Political A b e obliged if you would issue one and perhaps ' SI think it is likely that even if a warrant is issued by the Agency court most detirmined efforts will be made by the Kozaibis ta prevent its being enforced. 1 am writing to you in order that you may be a.,are of the circumstances before any case is made or any action taken ar asked from you. • • A man recently molested a servant of Shaikh Isa near Muharrak, by Shaikh Hamed's orders he was immediately arrested and kept in custody until tried.

Tours Sincerely, llajor E. A.Savory, Army :Ieadc;uarters, Simla.NOTE. The Qusaibis are said to be the descendeats oi a butcher and their native place is Riyadh,the present capital of Nejd. They consist of five brothers: Abdul Aziz binHasan. Abdul Rahman bin Hasan. Abdulla bin Kasan. Hasan bin Ibrahim. Sa T ad bin Ibrahim. All have the same mother but tke first three are real brothers and Hasan and Sa T ad (who lives at Hasa) are aiso real brothers. When Hasan,the father of the lirst three, died.his brother,Ibrahim,who was working as a camel driver at Hasa married his widow and had tnese two sous by her. All these brother are partners, both in traae ana property. The first four come and go between Nejd,'Iasa and Bahrain, but Abdul Rahman usually only comes here during the ~earling| season. Sa T ad always remains in Hasa. In the pearl trade they are the business associates of I oseuthal Treres. 2. The Qusaibis are of a very humble family called as T Biyasir T ,sometimes also called t Khadhiris T wuo,according to Arab custom can only marry people of low degree like themselves,even if very rich. 3. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rahman al Qusaibi were working as servants with one Muqbil al Idan,a well known .lasa merchant, owningproperty in Ilasa and Bahrain. Abdul Aziz is said to have started life as his coffee-boy,finally becoming his confidential clerk,and when Muc^bil died it was found that he had next to no property,it having mysteriously passed into the hands of Abaul Aziz,the Qusaibis present big office and the house near the Bank to the west formerly belonging to him. a. When Bin Sa T ad occupied Hasa,Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rahman came to Bahrain and opened an office for themselves. In the year 1335 A.H (1916/1917) they became bankrupt but Bin Sa T ud backed them and promised to pay their creoitors if they failed to do so.' . 2. (a). ABDUL A^IZ is a simple aad wise man and is the main stay of the firm. He passes as being pious. He seldom interferes in things that do not concern him and he is liked and respected by Bin Sa T ud. (b). ABDUL RAHI.!AN is more enlightened,with more education and has a wonderful flair for pearl dealing. He knows some French and English and normally conducts the firm's business in Paris,where he casts aside the garments of orthodoxy and sallies abroad in a dinner jacket f et melon T . He is sensible but very conceited. (c). ABDULLA is very intelligent and sharp but is a very mean and low character. Interferes in everything and is inclined to be boastful. He is not liked by jin Sa * ud. (d). HASAN is very foolish and gruff. He dashes in where tne others would fear to tread and is of as low a character as Abdulla. He is hot tempered and on receiving unwelcome correspondence has been known to tear it to pieces and eat the fragments. (e). GA T AD I have never met but he is said to be a good 'mixer' but also of low character like his brothers Hasan and ;bdulla. He always remains in Hasa. 5. The firm are reputed to be worth fifty lakhs of rupees and their property at Bahrain cannot be less than 14-15 lakhs at normal prices. Their influence is very Teat and growing as they hold the majority of Nejdis at Bahrain in the hollow of their hands,partly owing to their position as Bin Sa'ud's agents and pertly because the greater number are indebted to them. revenue 6. The newly appointed/officials on the mainland have reduced their easements as regards Customs dues to some extent but the ofher important merchants are in the same boat. 7. They are on bad terms with Bin Suwailim,the Amir of ;atif,and,of course,on extremely baa terms with the newnew revenue officials,particularly Muhammad al Tawwil. Abdul A-ziz once observed that last saw Muhammad al Tawwil he was on the end of a chain and he appeared to regret his having been released from that position, 8. The firm have now collected some £.40,Ju0 out of the f £.80,000 due to them by Bin Sa T ud and it is a mistake to suppose that he can afford to flout them as he would then be obliged to pay cash for his entire Riyadh committments if he transferred his patronage to another house. 9.
