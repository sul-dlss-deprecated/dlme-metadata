The enclosure is an extract of paragraphs 17 and 19 from despatch no.32 of 1854 (folio 325) from the Honourable Court of Directors, dated 22 November 1854. The despatch raises opinions expressed in letters sent to the Bombay Government by Kemball and by Commander Montriou, Senior Naval Officer in Aden, both of whom suggest that the presence of an additional British vessel, patrolling the southeast coast of the Arabian peninsula around Macullah [Al-Mukallā], would be sufficient to help better suppress the slave trade between East Africa and the Persian Gulf. Paragraph 19 of the despatch notes that these opinions confirm the Court of Directors’ own opinion that a force of far less strength than that deemed necessary by Sir Henry Leeke, Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, is required to tackle the slave trade.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000054#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
