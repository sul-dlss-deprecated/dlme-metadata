The previous method by which the public expressed their opinion was by signed petitions which were submitted to the government, but as most of the Shi 1 ah population and a large proportion of the Sunni population are illiterate, this system was not satisfactory and a few years ago a proclamation was issued which forbade the writing of pu/blic petitions. Before they were forbidden, intelligent mischief makers used to hawk round a petition and obtain sometimes thousands of signatures, but as the signatures in most cases consisted of thumb marks with the name of the alleged petitioner written over the thumb mark by the organiser, they were most unreliable. Systematical voting takes place when the Ivtoicipal councils are elected, the municipalities have lists of voters and issue voting slips which are signed and dropped into ballot boxes in various parts of the town, after they are counted by the President of the council. In Manamah, especially, there is great keenness over the municipal elections and comparatively large sums of money are spent by would-be members in encouraging people to vote for them. The term of the present council expires shortly and an election in Manamah is due almost atonee. An election was held some years ago in connection with the appointment of a new Shi 1 ah Qadhi, there were several suitable candidates and in order to ascertain the opinion of the Shi r ah public the principal men of each village came in and recorded a vote for one or othei of the candidates. Before the re-organisation of the education department the education committee was elected by voting* In the case of the Waqf committee last year, I myself supervised the elections. On given days I visitec a certain village, after notifying the people of the villages in the neighbourhood. All the men collected and each man was issued with a slip of paper. Two clerks stood a little way from the crowd and each man went upwent up to the clerk and told him whose name to write down as the man he wished to represent that district on the committee• Afterwards the slips were sorted and counted in the presence of the people and the man who had most votes was appointed. This simple form of election was very successful and ensured the election of men who were really| approved of by their villages. In most cases one individual obtained a large majority but in one or two districts the elections were very close. Only persons who appeared themselves were allowed to vote, the voting was secret and as the election took place in public, out of doors, it was impossible for persons from outside the district to vote for a district to which they did not belong. It is now the case that the people of Bahrain are familiar with the idea of elections by votes, the method is one which they seem not only to understand but to likei' 3. it is a remarkable development, but personally I have always regarded the Arab as having much in common with us in his political make up. The Shaikh and his Majlis are not unlike the Viking leader and the assembly or Ting - and Parliament not very far removed from either, though no doubt the passage of time has taught us more of the value of playing as a team.

Political Agency, Bahrain,the 18th June 1933. TywCz, 7 Gastrell f « arrival to take over charge as Political Agent,Bahrain,will give rise to a question which should 'be settled 'before he comes. He will 'be the first Political Agent to take over since the death of the late Shaikh and,as you know,for many years Shaikh 'Isa was too feeble to pay or return calls. 2. The practice of recent years has 'been that Shaikh Hemad (as Deputy Ruler) has called first on the Political Agent, At that call a time was arranged for the Political Agent to call on Shaikh ♦Isa in Muharraq,and also to return Shaikh Hamad's call. 3. My records are incomplete,but Shaikh T Isa (as Ruler) called on the Political Agent first on the occasion of Mr.Mungavin taking over from me in 1918 and on the occasion of Ife.jor Daly's taking over charge in 1921. I cannot trace when Shaikh 'Isa's health necessitated his ceasing to pay calls. 4. I am inclined to think that the time may have come to introduce the principle of the in-coming Political Agent calling first on the Shaikh,as it is in our interests to emphasise his status as an independent Ruler. He has now eleven guns as a personal salute,and it seems anomalous for a Ruler to pay the first call on an officer accredited to him. Moreover,the conditions in the past were rather different from those of the present dsy. In Qatar the Politice,! Agent pays the first call on the Shaikh, I should,however,'before making a definite recommendation, like to know what happens at Musca,t and Kuwait. I havetv ^ 2. T have served at Kuwait,'but have forgotten what occurred. 5. I do not think that Snaikh Hajnad iiimoelf would claim the courtesy,as he is almost embarrassing in his quick calls when a Political Agent returns from a recess or other long absence; but if the change is to be made,the present time immediately after the death of Shaikh ^sa seems the appropriate moment at which to make it. % d ^ (jLrd The Hon'ble Lieut-Col .T .C .V ii ' .Fowle, C .B .il., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.'O 4f , ' iipfc / »/7/S&gt; _ H al i M D.O.NO.138. Z 1 ^ POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT, Dated the 29th June 1933. f Reference your D.O. No.714-S, dated the 23rd June 1933. 2. The custom here has always been for the Shaikh to call on the new Political Agent first. The new Political Agent then makes his return official call on the same day (in uniform) accompanied by the retiring Political Agent (also in unifom). 3. Subsequent calls between the Shaikh and the Political Agent are always informal, except on the official occasions such as the Kings Birthday (when the Shaikh calls on the -olitical Agent) and important Ilohammedan festivals, (when the P.A. call on the Shaikh). Such calls are made in uniform and are not returned. 4. Here I have always tried to arrange that the Shaikh and I pay one informal call each week. This keeps relations good and pleases the Shaikh. 5. Should the Political Agent or Shaikh go away^ on leave ; or for a few days outside Kuwait limits, the person returning is always met, if he comes by the desert route, some 10 miles out of the Town by the other party, and simi larly on board ship if the return is by Sea. This is an Arab custom and has always been care fully adhered to in Kuwait. 6. Similarly if the Political Agent or the Shaikh is going to leave the State, on short or long leave, the person/- The Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C./^.Fowle ,C # B.

This also is an important Arab Custom and carefully adhered to here, 7» I attach a short statement shoiwng the local procedure as regards official calls, when the Political Resident or other important person arrives at Kuwait, which may be useful for record in your office as well as mine. \PROCEDURE ADOPTED IN KUWAIT IN THE MATTER OF OFFICIAL CALLS. ooo J^OJJ'ICIAL VISITS OF THE HON^RT.^ THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. The Shaikh calls on the Hon'ble the Political esident on the ship he arrives by, in uniform (sword &amp; decoration^, He is preceded by the Political Agent, who goes i hour ahead. The Political Resident lands at the Agency, stops there a short time, and then returns the Shaikh*s call ac companied by the Political Agent at the Shaikhs Town Palace. ITote^ The Political Resident usually endeavours to make such official visits to I'uwait in a warship. II«ARRIVAL OF H.S»THE NA7AL COI.H/JiNDER IN CHIEF. Procedure is same as for I above.

IV.ARRIVAL OF A FOREIGN ADMIRAL. The Political Agent goes on board in uniform and pays his official call. The Admiral returns the Political Agent's call at the Agency.

Please refer to your demi-olflcial letter No.C/206-1(a) 8 of 18th June 1933 on the subject of who should pay the first call - the Political A^ent or the Shaikh. 2. I enclose copy of a letter No.138 of £9th June 1933 from Colonel Dickson from which you will see that at Kuwait It is the Sbaikh who makes the first call. At Muscat, where the Sultan is His Highness and gets 21 guns, 'both the Political A^ent and the Political Besident make the first call. 3. I think on the whole that as far as Bahrain is concerned ive had better leave things as they are for the present, (unless the Shaikh raises the question, which he probably won't*), i.e. that the Shaikh should make the first call. The Shaikh's salute of 11 guns is after all only a personal one and not attached to the office of the Shaikh. 4 &lt;./ To, ^ tvcA — —p 1 : ' Coniiaentiai No:0/371. Political Agency, Bahrain,the 7th April 1934. From:- 10 • - Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch,I.A*, Political Agent, Baiarain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrain.

Hamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah,C.S.I., noted in the margin regard ing the remun eration of Shaikh Salman bin Hamad for his work on the Bahrain Gourt. 2. Shaikh Salman at present sits on the Bahrain Gourt jointly with the Adviser to the Baiirain Government (Mr.G.D. Belgrave), but at a conference during your visit to Bahrain in November 1933, it was thought that the presence on tne Banram Court of the Adviser was no longer appropriate ana tiiat it was prelerable if possible that the Ruling Family siiould be made responsible for the administration of justice. It was deciaed tnat tne time had come wjtien the woric of tne Court mignt be entrusted to Shaiida Salman,with the help of a younger member of tne Al Khalilaia, and that tne Adviser, wnose time migiit more properly be occupied witn otner matters, mignt be witndrawn from tne Courts. 3. The opportunity has, therefore, been taicen of the /lorthcommg(9 iortiicoming leave ol absence of tiie Adviser to place Salman in full charge of the Court ana to grant him an extra allowance for his increased responsibility. It is not proposed, that tne Adviser shall return to the Court, provided that Shaiida Salman maizes a success of the woric, with the exception that he will continue to sit with the Court in pearling cases, as he is in a position to withstand the pressure which influential persons connected with the pearling industry may attempt to exert on a Court consisting solely of local judges. 4. As a further safeguard, however, it is proposed that, should any case arise in wnich it may appear desirable to strengthen tne Court, His Excellency Shailih Hamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah should appoint the Adviser as an Additional Judge for the purpose of that particular case. b. I would only add that the somewhat obscure reference to slaughter-house fees has really nothing to do witn tne question of tne Court, but refers to a local squabble.
