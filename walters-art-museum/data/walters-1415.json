The tapestry weave of this piece is ideal for such textiles, as it produces a design that can be viewed from either side.\r\n\r\nThe woman, wearing earrings and a necklace with pendant, may be a personification. Different colors are used to achieve modeling of the cheeks, chin, and nose, and a subtle alteration of the weave distinguishes the lower edge of the face from the neck.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase, 1958", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/11468", "Provenance": "Walters Art Museum, 1958, by purchase.", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-04-03T17:18:55.603", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_83.689_Fnt_BW.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
