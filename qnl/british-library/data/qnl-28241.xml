H.M.S. M ^rosGrplne M captured a boat from which the an;.s had beer Jettisoned at the end of March. She The Txport to the Mekran Coast. also captured a small dliow on April Iflth' containing 1600 rifles and ammunition.

On June 13th a dhow which was sighted by the 'Redbreast' Jettisoned POO rifles and ai.munition. On June 19th news was received that another dhow sighted by the'Sphinx' had Jetti soned TOO rifles and ammunition. Early in Eeoember a badan carrying ICO rifles with ammu nition was boarded by H.M.S. but the cargo had been Jettisoned before cno was overhauled. Shortly afterwards Eersian Customs officials in the launch 'Mazanderan' captured a dinghy containing 12 rifles and 600 rounds of anm.unit ion • The Ka.hcda who was captured was fined Hs.260 and beaten before being reles-sed* This is the sut. total of suoceBseo. On the other hand during the nine months under report, acccrding to infonuation procurod here about 18,000 rifles with 100 rounds of ammunition per rifle left Muscat for Mekraru According to information received by the telegraph authorities AT. c^/ on the deieran Ccast a total ox 'bj &gt; bTC 1 rifles were landed with about 2000,000 rounds of ammunition, and also a consignment of 600 revolvers. * v In August two British India Hail Steamers were searched for ankvs by H.M.S. 'Sphinx' in Muscat harbour and a few con cealed weapons were found which were supposed to be destined for Koweit. Major Cox inform d the Go^errm:ent of India that this course of Exports to Gulf 'orts. action, if parsevered in, would, in all probability have a prejudicial effect on the amenabloneso of the Shaikh of Koweit andarid the oultan of Muscat. As no practical harm would result from terporary inactivity, since the traffic to Kov/eit did not immediately affect British interests. Major Cox ashed the Senior Kaval Officer to suspend activity pending intimation of the wishes of the Government of India. The Government of India approved the Resident’s action. The arts which were seized were made over to His Highness the Guitar for disposal. According to information procured mere about 16,000 rifle* with ICO rounds per rifle were exported tc Howeit, while r,0P0 rifles went to other Gulf ports, Ivatr, Rae-el-Jehal and Abu Dhabi. Two hundred rifles and ammunition were also said to have been exported to Dhofar. In December 1907 the Tolitical Agent was informed that the Italian Government proposed to send an Agent to Muscat to organise a service of information regarding the contraband trade ir arcs between Muscat and Italian Somaliland. The rolitical Agent was ins tructed to afford the Agent any facilities he might require. In January 1908, the Italian Government intimated that it was their intention to found a regular offi cial Consular Agency at muscat and ashed for the co-operation locally of the British Government both with reference to the Agent’s ordinary duties and as regards the arms traffic. At the instance of His Majesty’s Government the Italian Government agreed to defer action in the natter until the result of the Brussels Arms Trade Conference, then sitting, was made known. In October, the Italian Government again represented the necessity of sending an Agent to ?&gt;!uscat, in view of the fact that there was little prospect of an early settlement of the Arms Trade guest ion. They stated that this mission would have no political aim, but would furnish valuable information, and in the circumstances, was the only means available tc them for checking the important arms traffic between Muscat and 3omali- lar^d, where the attitude of the Mullah made the matter urgent. I, Traffic with Somaliland.In the meantime, however, the ^clitioal Agent, Captain MoConaghey, had been taking stepe locally to prevent the export of arms to Somaliland# On learning that sore Somali dhows had arrived in Oman waters he made three trips in IT.’t.S#Sphinx? along the Groan and Truolol Coasts and collected the papers of 14 dhows explaining to the Kakhodas that the papers would be returned before they left Oman waters, provided that the cargo of the dhow was found in each case to contain no illicit arms# The hosts gathered at 3ur or their return Journey and the papex*s of all but one, which had gone on ahead, were returned to the Kakhodas there, after search# Information regarding the one that had gone on ahead was telegraphed to Aden for such further action as might be necessary# The Italian Government were informed in Kovember 1906 of the steps which had beer taken locally by Eritish Officers, srd it was suggested to them that the objects they, had in view would be much better served by the unobtrusive despatch of a trustworthy native informer than by appointing a Consular re presentative# The Italian Government accepted the view and on the 24th November the Political Agent was informed tnat a native Italian Agent would be sent to Muscat. It is rot probable that more than a few hundred rifles have found their way- from Muscat to Italian Somaliland during the period# Two hundred rifles which ?#ore sent fron here to Dhofsr may- have been destined for the Somali Coast. The exports in this direction might be put roughly at £00# The total amoimt of experts according to information procurable here is S6,04C rifles, 600 re volvers and 5606,000 cartridges as agalnib Total Exports. imports of 80,190 rifles, 760 revolvers and 9646,400 cartridges leaving * Note.- The figures furnished by the Customs authorities are 89,100 rifles, 760 revolvers and 7964,600 ammunition. They calculate roughly at the rate of 60 rifles to a case.leaving a ‘balance of about 44,1£0 rifles, C6G revolvers and C9C9,4G0 aiuinunltion to 'be either aV^orbec; locally or stored. It is protable, however, tiiat the exports both to the Mehran Coast ard up the Culf exceeded the fiGh^ren mentioned atsove. A gun merohant in conversation with the Political Apert recently, estimated the experts to Xoweit at 36,000 rifles for the last months, and said that the greater part of these went to Eisrbehir and Mardin via Maeul. Steps are being taken to procure more accurate statistics in future. In April 1900 a Conference at which the British, French, German and Italian Governments were repre sented, met at Brussels to consider the question of the illicit arts trade.

His Highness the Sultan has enjoyed fairly good health during the year, hut he has heen subject to occasional attacks of fever. His Highness’ cousin Saiyid Ali hin Salim left for Zanzibar on a visit on January 6th. He returned on September 26 th. His Highness the Sultan proceeded to Sib on March 16th accompanied by His sons Saiyids Nadir and Muhammad. His High ness returned to Muscat on April 29th. His Highness again went to Sib on October 16th and returned on October 28th. Habib bin Sulayiaag the individual mentioned in last year’s report, arrived from Mombasa on April 24th in the 'Nur-ul-Bahar”. He brought a motor-boat for His Highness. Saiyid Taimur, His Highness’ eldest son left for India on September 16th. He returned on October 26th after a stay in Karachi and Bombay. On November 20bn His Highness’ two sons Saiyids Nadir Muhammad were betrothed respectively to the daughters of Ali bin Salim. His Highness accompanied by Saiyids Nadir and All bin Salim went to Iti on .December 25rd. // The usual intertribal feuds have continued throughout the year and many persons have been murdered. — —On tiie night of* April 18th while His Highness the Sultan was staying in the fort at Nalchl three of His Highness* followers were treacherously shot in The As Siabiyin. their sleep by men of the As Siabiyin tribe. The murderers fled. His Highness returned at once to Sib and collected men and supplies with a view to hostili ties against the offending tribe. On May 10th Saiyids Taimur and Nadir with a punitive force entered Nafah, the country of the As Siabiyin. They destroyed the latter*s forts and \ returned to Bidbid. The operations were finally closed by the surrender of three Shaikhs of the As Siabiyin who were despatched to Muscat and confined in the fort by His Highness the Sultan. MUSCAT. His Highness* telephone line was extended to Sib in February, a distance of about 25 miles from Mutrah. In March the local American Missionaries made arrange ments for tailing a house in Mutrah and for opening a dispensary there without first obtaining the sanction of Fid Highness the the Sultan. His Highness was unfavourably disposed towards the undertaking for administrative reasons, and desired the American Consul to represent his objections to the United States Government. The matter is still under discussion but in the meanwhile, the American Missionaries are continuing their medical work. On February 6th a public meeting was held by His High ness the Sultan, for the purpose of collecting subscriptions for the construction * of a new Hospital. His Highness headed the subscription list with a donation of Rs.11,600 on behalf of himself, his brother and his family, and the local community - Europeans, Arabs and Indians - subscribed Rs,2 6,000, A site waswas provided free of cost/ by some Oman subjects resident in Zanzibar, The total sum required was completed by donations of Rs.20,000 from the Government of India and Rs,2,000 from the Admiralty. The work was commenced in August and the foundation stone was laid on November 29th, At the moment of writing, the building is well on its way towards completion. SUR. In February His Highness the Sultan received intelli gence that a dhow named 'El Kadra' belonging to an Arab resi ding at Sur had been seized by Italians at Hafun on the coast of Italian Somaliland on the ground that it was employed In smuggling arms from Muscat to the Somali Coast. The Nakhoda of the dhow by name Mubarak bin Khamis arrived in Muscat in March and stated that on his arrival at Hafun the Italians^ the dhow but had found only one old rifle on board. They never theless confiscated the dhow, despatched tiie passengers, 174 In number, to Mombasa in another boat, and detained Mubarak him- . self at Hafun for one month and eighteen days. The nakhoda also stated that when the Italian Officer boarded the dhow he seized and destroyed the Oman flag which she carried. The Nakhoda was in possession of a license granted by His Highness the Sultan and countersigned by the Political Agent of .Muscat, authorising him to carry 5 rifles for protection. He had, however, ordered all the rifles to be landed at Sur, before leaving Oman territory, and the single rifle found concealed on board had been retained surreptitiously b 3 ^ one of the crew. Shortly after?/ards, information reached Muscat to the effect that the Italian authorities had confiscated the flags of about thirty Muscat vessels at Hafun and had captured a second dhow. His Highness the Sultan was greatly annoyed at the action of the Italian authorities and requested His Majesty's Government to assist him in securing reparation for the insult to his flag and compensation for the losses suffered by the Nakhoda. ' The matter is still under discussion between his Majesty's Govern ment and the Italian Government.IV. CUSTOMS. The management of His Highness f Customs continued to to he inefficient and unsatisfactory. V. SULTAL *S FINANCES. His Highness is now deeply in debt and is often hard pressed to find money for current expenses. The expedition against the As Siabiyin was very costly and large sums have probably been spent for placating the tribes of the interior.ARMS TRAFFIC Tlie following table compiled from appendices I - IV to this Report shows the number of cases of arms and ammuni tion imported into Muscat by ships flying British, German and Russian flags between January 1st and December 31st 190S, Ships.

M WJ- W X V/ OwjyO • 1,788 16 6,303 10 and the total number of rifles imported during the period was 80,190, so that there has been a considerable falling off in imports. It is difficult to say with certainty to what reason the decrease is due. Local reports attribute it to the apprehension which was aroused as to the probable result of the Brussels Arms Conference. Possibly, the severe ill ness and eventual death on October 16th of Monsieur Goguyer, the notorious arms merchant, may have had something to do with\ / N &lt;$) it. Posoitly also tJie local market was rather over stocked. E^OPwT _i'Q :iUZ-iAIl COAoT . From Appendix V to this report it will he seen that 27,786 rifles, 1,774,600 rounds of ammuni tion and 300 pistols are known to have been exported to the Mekran Coast. Large It is probable that many more pistols were exported than have been accounted quantities of arms and for. j - ammunition were expo : t€cL to Katr, Bahrein, Koweit and Persia, but no reliable figures can be procured regarding these. Exports to Somaliland were insignificant. CAPTURES . From Appendix VT it v/ill be seen that the capture# made by His Majesty’s Ships during the year accounted for 6,897 rifles and 826,400 rounds of ammunition. The captures effected by H.M.S. M Fox ,, in March depressed the trade temporar- rily but small consignments continued to be run across during the hot weather, and early in September there wa.s a vigorous recrudescence of the smuggling. Several large consignments were then carried across and stored at places near the coast pending the arrival of Afghan purchasers. The captures made by His Majesty’s Ships early in December paralysed the trade and at the time of writing it has not recovered from the blows inflicted. It is significant that a considerable proportion of the rifles captured consisted of small bore magazine weaporS and that some of the ammunition was found to contain expand ing bullets. / BRUSSELS ARMS CCi^ETcZhCE. The Brussels International Arms Conference broke up in December without achieving any result affecting the trade at Muscat.FOREIGN CONSULS Mr. Mahomed Fazil, a Khoja British subject was in charge of the American Consulate as Vice &amp; Deputy Consul from January 1st till September P,7th when Mr. J.

During the year 1909 thirty-four slaves applied to be freed. Of these 20 were Mekranis and fourteen Africans. Sixteen Mekranis and twelve Africans were granted manumission certificates and the remaining four Mekranis and two Africans either proved not to be entitled to freedom or went back to their masters of their own accord.

VISITS OF RESIDENT• On March 17th, on nis return from leave, Lieut. Colonel P* Z• Cox, C*3.1•,C.I.F., Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Muscat on H.M.S. 'Odin'. Official calls were exchanged with tne Sultan and the usual salute fired. The Resident left in the 'Lawrence' on the 19th March. On the 14th August the Resident again visited Muscat. During this visit several private calls were paid on the Sultan, wno also called on the Resident, and various matters were discussed. _discussed. A good many outstanding cases, notably the compensation for the loss of the Ganja 'Alam Dad M dating from 1906, and the more recent but troublesome case of compensation to Mr. Harparshad Laxmansingh for wrongful dismissal, were satisfactorily settled. DEMISE OF On the morning of 7th May tiie sad news of the HIS MAJESTY His Majesty Edward VII was received at Muscat :^XY*ARD VII. His Highness the Sultan on receipt of the news paid a visit to the Political Agent to express nis condolence with the Royal Family and country. His Highness the Sultan and tie Foreign Consuls kept their flags at half mast for three days and the bazaars were closed for one day as a mark of respect. On the 10th 68 minute guns were fired by H.M.S. 'Odin”. On the 80th May the occasion of the funeral of His late Majesty, all Government offices and shops were closed, and His Highness* battery fired a salute of 68 minute guns, the last gun being fired at sunset; the flags of Fis High ness the Sultan and all the Consulates, which had been at half mast during the day were hauled down on the firing of the 1ast gun. TT ™ TTT _ Tiie Health of His Highness the Sultan has been HIS HIGHNESS AND FAMILY g0 ° a throusllout ' ‘ Uie y ear * Til e relations between His High ness and the Agency have been on the whole good in spite of the severe strain which has been put on them by the financial straits into which His Highness has been thrown by the success of the operations for the suppression of the Arms Traffic. On the 13th August (7th Shahban 1328) a son was bom to Saiyid Taimur. The boy has been named Saeed. During the last week of December the marriages of Saiyid Nadir and Saiyid Muhammad with two daughters of Saiyid Ali bin Salim bin Thuwaini were celebrated. Portions of the town/ town were decorated and Festivities took place for several days. Saiyid Talmur gave an entertainment to tile PXiropean community and otiiers at the Customs House on the 6rd January 1911 in honour of the occasion. CONDITION OF COUNTRY. The usual intertribal disputes and raids and counter raids took place at intervals during the year. Most of these were petty affairs, the only important occurrence of this sort during the year being the distur bances at Sohar in the hot weather and the autumn. It appears that the Wall of Sohar, Salim bin Suleiman bin Suweilim, had made himself very unpopular throughout the district by his tyranical methods. The ill feeling against him was brought to a head by the V/ali insisting on buildiig a tower in Wadi Qur on a caravan route leading to Sohar from the interior, and kHK Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Naeemi, aided and abetted by Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi, assumed a threatening attitude. The Kali marched out of Sohar in the middle of October against Sultan Muhammad but was defeated. His Highness the Sultan proceeded to Sohar in the 'Nur-ul-Bahar' on the 21st of October, and eventually succeeded in effecting a settlement by acceeding in a great measure to the demands of the tribesmen. It was arranged that the tower in the Wadi Qpr should be razed to the ground and that His Highness should pay the annual ’Farizaa* (allowance) of £.8,000 to Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid and Sultan Muhammad Al-Naeemi Jointly, and that these two Shaikhs should occasionally visit I.Tuscat to discuss with His Highness matters concerning that portion of his domi nions. There appears to have been some talk of recalling tiie Wall in six months time, but this has not been done, though the Wall is at present (February 1911) in Muscat answering various charges and claims against him. His Highness has been advised by most of the important men in Muscat to recall this individual - who appears to be an ill conditioned© conditioned and truculent Sidi - Tout so far refuses to do so. In August His Highness began to try and collect an increased ,, Ashur M export duty on the Eatineh Coast, apparently with the viev/ of increasing his revenue, and also of preventing goods being sent to Debai for export. This order raised considerable ill feeling and some men of the Yal Saad tribe burnt several houses in Masnaa on this account. The British subjects trading at Khabura and other places on the Batineh Coast also petitioned the Political Agent against this duty. In the discussion which this point raised His Highness denounced the 1861 Treaty of Commerce between Great Britain and Oman,and on November 2Srd gave 12 months f notice for revision of the Treaty required by Article 225 thereof. 3ur. The affair of the seizure of the dhow ’TChadra” by the Italian authorities referred to in last year’s report formed the subject of correspondence between His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government throughout the year. At the end of the year the Italian Government made a pro posal to return the dhow and the non-perishable goods therein, and give some compensation to the Nalihoda provided the latter would sign a declaration that the seizure of the dhow was technically legal, and that His Majesty’s Government would pay an equal portion of the compensation. It has not been possible however to get hold of the Nakhoda who was reported to have gone to Aden on a voyage. ARMS TRAFFIC. it- During the year under review this question has overshadowed all others at Muscat. At the end of 1909 His Majesty’s Government had decided to blockade the Mekran Coast and suppress as far as possible the export of arms from Muscat to Mekran, Several large captures were made in December 1909 and January 1910, and the traffic was paralysedW 1 paralysed for some montlis, until tde weather became very hot and the Afghans who had been waiting at 3ohar decided to leave at all hazards. This resulted in two more large captures; viz two dhows containing some 2,000 rifles and 260,000 rounds of ammunition by H.M.S, '’Philomel' on the 24th April, and one dhow containing some 2,300 arms and 286,000 rounds of ammunition by H.M.S. 'Perseus' on the 26th flay. After this nothing more happened till September when the Baluchis started talcing over small cargoes. On the 28til October a cargo of some 000 rifles belonging to the people of L'izak was successfully landed, but another cargo of some 360 rifles was found and seized Toy a landing party from K. .3. 'Proserpine' on the 2nd November 1910. Until the end of the year therefore very few rifles were landed, the practice of carrying small consignments having been stopped by the burning of dhows proved to have landed them. The following statement kindly given me by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Oulf, is interesting. Particulars• 1909 1910 Number of dhows destroyed. ... 6 7 Number of arms captured. ... 7,000 8,000 Number of rounds of ammunition captured. 900,000 1,600,000 Percentages of expanding bullets. 6 &lt;jh 1 Percentages of modem rifles. ... 38 45 f The above table shews the result of each year about the same, but in reality the seizures are nearly all made in the season 1909-1910, the traffic for the 3 910J-1911 season having so far been very small and only 610 rifles have been captured. This activity on the part of His Majesty's Ships hasIn 1908 the prices of rifles of which there is a record were - Mauser rifle Rs.120 to 140/-, Martini-Metford Rs.110 to 120/-, and Mauser Pistol (10-shot) with 400 rounds of azmnu- nitior Es.100/-. In the end of November the branches of the 'Oompap*- nie de I’Indes et de 1'Extreme Orient” and of MM. Baijeot &amp; Cie, and of Kevorkoff &amp; Cie, all sold off their stocks by auction and the Agents of the two first named firms. Messieurs Lapique and bagasse, left the place. M. Nischan Hormuz I an, the representative of Kevorkoff &amp; Oie, remained here and has set up as an arms dealer on his own account. At the time of these sales Martini carbines could be bought for Rs.ll to 12/- each. Somadliana . The traffic in arms v/ith Somaliland during the year was insignificant, in fact the trade seems to have been nipped in the bud in 1908. Tables of the import of arms and ammunition com piled from the Customs House books are annexed to the report. ^,IC HEALTH HOSPITAL, QUARANTINE, ETC. Until the autumn the health of Muscat was normal • On 21st September however cholera broke out, and continued to hang about the outskirts of the town until the end of November, except for three weeks in October when it seemed to have disappeared. The port was finally declared free on the 12th leoember. The epidemic was fortunately not very severe only 81 deaths being reported in all. The disease appeared in Sur in November and v/as very severe there, and also in the neighbourhood. It was also bad in Eostak and the neighbourhood at the 'end of the year. Tiie New Hospital was, opened in the end of October but owing to the cholera no public ceremony took place. It maymay 'be ment/ioned His Highness did not/ evince any par ticular desire to have a public opening. The quarantine arrangements under the supervision of the Agency burgeon worked smoothly during the year. The Customs were managed throughout the year t&gt;v CUSTOMS AND ^ LAHEING Superintendents on behalf of tne Sultan. The Superinten- AKRANGEHEUTS. dent at j^uscat is in the habit of issuing goods received &gt; t/o consignees without the production of a Delivery Order or even of the Bill of Lading. As it frequently happens that Banks and firms have got a lien on the goods till the cost is paid this practice will probably lead to trouble. The attention of His Highness has been called to the matter. The Landing Contractor, Saiyid Abdul Kadir Zowavi, is quite inefficient and complaints of theft by his men, slackness, want of boats, etc. are rife. His Highness is however deaf to all complaints against this man. There was a report at the end of the year that the Sultan intended to farm the Customs to Habib bin Suleyim, Sai 3 , id Yusuf Zowavi and Ali Ifusa, but this arrangement has apparently fallen through. SLAVT TRADE. During the year 1910 Forty-nine persons applied for manumission certificates either for themselves or for their relatives or both, and two sought relief against being enslaved. The latter were given letters by the Sultan to the local Walis to secure protection for them. Fiftj—four persons including children were manumitted during the j^ear, 2S of whom were rescued through the good ofiices of this Agency; 6 of these however having obtained their freedom from His Highness did not come to receive tr.eix manumissicr certificates. One applicant whose master was a French protege was sent to the French Consul who gave aim a certificate equivalent to a freedom paper. In four cases the applicants left the Agency premises when their casecases were under investigation and in seven other cases the applicants were proved either not entitled to freedom or went back to their masters under suitable guarantees. Of ohe 4&amp; applicants 16 were Africans of whom 10 were free!. The rest were all Baluchis of Mekran. The traffic in Mekranis appears to be on the increase, if anything, and by far the larger proportion of refugee slaves who come to this Agency are now Mekranis, Ris Excellency the Commander-in-Chief has visited ROYAL Muscat on several occasions during the year, and all the other Ships of the East Indies Squadron have been constantly in and out of the port in connection with the Arms Traffic operations. The Turkish man-of-war 'Marmaris' visited Muscat on the 18til January, In August Lr, Bennett arrived and re—opened the Dispensary at Mutrah; in December he was relieved by Dr. Harrison, a young man who has recently Joined the Mission ill of enthusiasm. He has turned his own quarters into a sort of hospital and is doing good work at Mutraa. On the 26th December the Revd. Dr. Cantine, who xias been in charge of the Mission at Muscat off and on for many years, left for Basreh Tfith Mrs. Cantine, being relieved oy the Reva. Mr. Barney and Mrs. Barney. Miss'Button also Joined tne Muscat Mission and a lady Doctor will probably be posted later. The rainfall for the year amounted to 2*91 inches. Tlie weatner s ee*ae&lt;i to be cooler than usual, the highest WEATHER AMD RAIHFALL. temperature recorded was 107*4 on 7th June. The highest averag©^temperature was 98.0 in June and the highest aver-/ average night; t/einperat/ure v/as 86*6 in t/he same month. The lowest day temperature recorded was 61 *0 on January 16th and the lov^est night temperatitre was 60*6 on January 14th. Tables of temperatures and rainfall are appended. L.S.F.In cont»inua1jior; of my letter Iio.261 dat»ed tdie Ifetii February 1911 witn wiilcli I forwarded the Annual Admlnlstrat/lon Report, I no?* forward tv/o notes by the Agency Surgeon on the recent Oholera epidemic and on the new Hospital as appendices to tne report. These were not ready to go with the report. You will observe that the import of arms has fallen to about one •third of the former annual import which is very satisfactory, This year I have not sent ary tables of reported departures of anas from Hus cat, or of landings on the Hekran Coast which have been a feature of the reports of recent years as the former table is misleading, and the latter will have been supplied in Mr. Gumbley f 3 report.
