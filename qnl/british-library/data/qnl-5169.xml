The Chinese Legation hi ve referred this case to their Government but so far they have had no reply. While Hinsler has been in Bagdad he has been looked after by C.I.C.I. C. I.C.I. is now closing down and the R. A. F. wish to take Hinsler down to Bahrein where they would be responsible for his maintenance. '' 1 his was suggested to Wing Commander Williams, A.L. 3. 0. , H. A.F. ^ Bahrein, on his recent visit to Bagdad, who asked us to clear the matter with you* Hinsler is a harmless character and would cause no trouble, but when C.I.C.I. finally withdraw from here there is no-one vho could look after him and it may be some time before a decision is reached by the Chinese. Should the Chinese agree to allow him to return to China the R. A. F* would arrange for his onward passage from Bahrein. /N This is a matter of some urgency and we should be very grateful if you could let w know by telegram whether there is any objection to the proposal to bring Hinsler to Bahrein. I am sending a copy of this letter to A.L.S.O., R. A.F. , Bahrein, who I believe has already liscussed the matter with the State Adviser* Lieutenant Colonel AiC. Galloway, C. I.

A great deal of time and ingenuity was spent attempting to elucidate his past, and his story, as he told it, is as follows: He was born in Hotan, Western China, in 1902 of English parents. His father Jackob (this is his own spelling) and his mother Helen, died in nis infancy and he was cared for by his father’s friend Henry Peters. This person was an Englishman who brought aim up speaking and writing English, and impressed upon him that his parents were British and that ne shoulo consider himself as such. When he was about seven years of age Peters, who was a storekeeper of some kind, died and leit aim alone in the world. After living under the care of a Chinese xnoslem named Lusichan until he was about 16 years of age, Hinsler went to Yarkand and took up casual employment. About 1924 he claims to have moved on to Meralbashi where he stayed until about 1930. From then onwards he drifted further westward through Vv'az iris tan and other parts of Afghanistan and he believes that he crossed into Persia in 1939. Here he claims to have lived a wild-man existence in the mountains until the time he was arrested by the Persian Police for being without any means of identification. Having failed to either confirm or refute his story it was arranged that he should be interviewed by the acting Consul-General in Basra. Mr. Steptoe had spent some time in China and was able to interrogate Hinsler/W-fyrr S \ - 2 - ilinsler in Chinese, and his conclusions were as follows (1) He did not believe Hinsler's story that he was born in Hotan of British parents nor did he believe in the existence of a person named Peters. Hotan, he concluded, must be identified with Khotan and he had never heard of any British subjects being resident there. (2) He confirmed that Hinsler had a working knowledge of the Chinese language but, he asserted, Hinsler had neither the fluency nor purity of accent which would follow from speaking that language as a child in a purely Chinese atmosphere. (3) He thought that Hinsler had learnt the language most probably in some port in China, possibly Tientsin or perhaps Harbin or Mukden. Hinsler's pronunciation indicated that he had lived with people speaking the Northern dialect but he may have learnt Chinese in the cour^ of his wanderings in the interior of China; certainly he knows the names of prominent places situated on the main caravan route into Hsinkiang. Because of this mystery concerning his antecedents rA and his complete lack of identity documents, Hinsler was ( interned in Persia during the war. It was originally intended that he should be handed over to the Persian Police when the British troops evacuated Persia but due tc an administrative slip up he was flown to the Kiddle East with other internees and was not sent back until after British troops had left Persia. He has been held here ever since pending negotiations through H.M. Embassy Tehran to hand him over to the Persian Police, but it is now understood that the Persian Police are, not unnaturally, unwilling to accept him. Hinsler's wish is to return to China.

An accompanying aide memoire contains a record of the verbal account given by John Hinsler, who claimed to have been born in 1902 in China to English parents and orphaned as a child. In a letter of reply, the Political Agent declines to accept the transfer of John Hinsler to Bahrain pending his repatriation to China, on the grounds of his former connection with Persia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy in Iraq, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>China</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Internment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Vagrants</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00001e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
