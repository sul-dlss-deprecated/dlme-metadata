In his Kemball letter states that Shaikh Muḥammad has asked that he be allowed to act against Fayṣal ibn Turki as he wishes. Kemball responds by asking Shaikh Muḥammad for patience in seeking a response from Fayṣal ibn Turki, and that further attack would only complicate matters. Kemball also writes to Fayṣal ibn Turki, emphasising that a reponse from him remains forthcoming. The following enclosures are included with Kemball’s letter:1. The translation of a letter (folio 42) from Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah, to Kemball, dated 24 December 1854;2. The translation of a letter (folio 43) from Kemball to Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah, dated 24 December 1854;3. The translation of a letter (folio 44) from Kemball to Fayṣal ibn Turki Āl Sa‘ūd, dated 8 January 1855.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x000016#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
