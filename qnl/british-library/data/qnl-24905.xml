Thus a great advance has been made towards the settlement of this long outstanding grievance of the Sheikh of Koweit but a new complication has arisen in that the Saudi Government now insist that in addition to the trade agreement there should also be agreements relating to extradition and bon voisinage . It was originally thought that the latter agreements would be considered after a trade agreement had been brought into operation but the Saudi Government have now made it perfectly plain that they regard it as that the '2 . three agreements should come into force simultaneously and there appears to he no prospect of ending the present system of blockade unless this is agreed to by the Sheikh Prima facie the Saudi Government’s attitude is not unreasonable and it is to be hoped that the Sheild can be induced to agree to their proposals. The next step will be for the Political Agent at Koweit to show the Saudi version of the trade regulations to the Sheikf. and if, as is hoped, the Sheikt’s agreement is obtained, it will then be necessary to ascertain his reactions to the proposal for agreements relating to extradition and the bon voisinag e. The Saudi Government evidently contemplate that these additional agreements should be on the lines of those in force between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. While the extradition agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq appears to be generally suitable as a basis for discussion of a similar agreement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit, the treaty of bon voisinage appears to contain much that would be objectionable to His Majesty’s Government from the point of view of its inclusion in an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit and it is thought that for present purposes it will be sufficient if the objects of the treaties are explained to the Sheik in general terms. If he agrees in principle, the actual terms of the agreements can be taken up with the Saudi Government. As regards the form which the agreements eventually should take, it will be seen from the submission at P.Z. U 819/36 (flag B) that it was then contemplated that the trade agreement should be recorded in an Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes. Nothing has occurredMinute Paper. Department. 3. r&gt; which makes it undesirable to depart from that view and it is thought that the same procedure should he adopted in the case of the proposed agreements relating to extradition and bon voisinage . This matter has not yet been put before the Shei&amp;but as a stage has now been reached at which agreement is in sight (at any rate in regard to the commercial side) it seems desirable that the Shei&amp;. should be made aware of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government. The time and method of approach will, however, require careful consideration and this might be left to the discretion of the local political authorities.

Important. Dear Symon Many thanks for your letter P.Z.3438/37 of the 2nd June with which you were so good as to send me copies of the revised Saudi-Koweit anti-smuggling regulations as they emerged after our meeting with de Gaury on the 29th May. 2. We concur in this revised text 'but, after due consideration, Rendel feels that it would be useless to attempt to secure Sheikh Yusuf Yasin f s concurrence in these changes here and now. 3. We are far from sure whether he would have authority to agree on his own responsibility to any alterations. Moreover, there may in any case be other changes to suggest as the result of de Gaury f s discussions with the Sheikh and we might merely be taking two bites at Symon, Ssq pecb, r hi. mn 1 JUN 1937 •txrzi'fr'the same cherry by putting to him now the small textual alterations which we have made. 4. We would therefore suggest that (subject of course to Fowle’s views) the next step should be for de Gaury to approach the Sheikh and show him the revised version of the proposed agreement explaining that, though it differs slightly in form - but not in substance - from the last version put forward by the Saudi-Arabian Government, we see no reason why they should raise any objections to it. 5. With regard to the other two agreements which the Saudi-Arabian Government wish to conclude concurrently with the anti-smuggling regulations, we are prepared to leave it to the authorities in the Gulf to decide on the method of approach to the Sheikh, but we understand in regard to all three agreements that the India Office are quite prepared for Captain de Gaury to take a fairly firm line with the Sheikh in inducing him to accept such Saudi proposals as His Majesty f s Government think reasonable. 6 .

The amended draft Regulations enclosed with Jedda despatch No. 77 of 25th April were scrutinised by Mr.Brenan, Captain de Gaury and myself at a meeting held at the India Office on 29th May. We were all agreed that they are generally suitable, though the actual wording is by no means watertight. The result of our discussions is the revised version immediately below this note. We have substituted ’’Koweit territory’’ for ’’Koweit” wherever necessary, and have added the words ”or party” after ’’caravan” in Article 2; and in order to meet the Saudi point dealt with in para.10 of Sir R.Bullard’s despatch we have suggested a new Article 8 in which we have incorporated Article 5 of the Saudi draft. We have not, of course, attempted to make the Regulations word perfect.! V i Captain de Gaury considers that there is a reasonaDle probability that our revised version will be acceptable to the Sheikh of Koweit and it ia- at his suggestion that we have proposed that the Regulations shall remain in force for a period of three years. He thinks that the Sheikh will welcome a long rather than a short period. The next step might be for the Foreign Office to sho the revised draft to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin who is still in this country; and if, as is thought probable, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin agrees the way will then be clear (subject to any observations which the Political Resident may have to ^ offer) for an a-pproaoh to the Sheikh of Koweit. The method of approach to the Sheikh of Koweit will require careful consideration, particularly in view of the Saudi insistence that there should also be an Extradition Treaty and a Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage, but this can/ 5853 5000 3/37can perhaps he left over until we hear whether the revised Regulations are acceptable to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin.

HigJi Commissioner for Iraq to Lord Pass field.—{Communicated to Foreign Office, May 28.) (Confidential.) My Lord, Pagdad, May 6, 1931. I HAVE the honour to transmit copies in translation of correspondence between King Ibn Sand and myself,^) between the Minister for foreign Affairs of the Hejaz-Nejd Government and Nuri Pasha, and between King Ibn Sand and Nuri Pasha,( J ) and also the texts of the “ Bon-Voisinage Treaty, Arbitration Protocol and Extradition Treaty, signed at Mecca on the 7th and 8th April, 1931. 2. Nuri Pasha has not yet issued a report on his tour, as the secretary to the mission has not yet returned to Bagdad. Nuri Pasha has, however, told me the gist of his discussions at Mecca, and, in any case, the results of his mission are sufficiently illustrated by the instruments that he negotiated and signed. ( T ) Not printed. ! /3. Before he left Bagdad Nuri Pasha discussed with me in detail the questions that he proposed to raise with the Hejaz-Nejd Government, these were— (i) The “ Bon-Voisinage ' Treaty and Arbitration Protocol. (ii) Extradition. (iii) Ibn Mashhur. . . , , , n (iv) The payment by tne Hejaz-Nejd Government of the balance ot Pzo,U00 outstanding on account of Iraq tribal claims. Nuri Pasha told me that he had no intention of discussing the project of a pan-Arab alliance, except in so far as measures for the removal of customs and passport barriers, which he intended to propose, could be said to further this 01*010P t He also informed me of his intention to send Taha-al-Hashimi, the chief of the General Staff, on a mission to the Imam of Yemen, and undertook, on my suggestion, to acquaint King Ibn Sand with his intention first, and to ensure that His Majesty had no objection. Finally,’ in view of Sir John Shuckburgh’s demi-official letter, dated the 12th November, 1930, I asked Nuri Pasha to ascertain whether King Ibn Sand still harboured any resentment in regard to the appointment of Dr. Abdullah Damluji as Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. 4. As regards the instruments signed by Nuri Pasha at Mecca, your Lordship will observe that the texts of the “Bon-Voisinage” Treaty and Arbitration Protocol correspond closely to the texts initialled in Bagdad a year ago. Such amendments as have been made conform generally to advice tendered by this High Commission. The exceptions are the incorporation in the preamble of a somewhat obscure paragraph referring to “ the desire of their Majesties to exert every possible effort to compose the affairs of the Arab nation and unite her word,” and the insertion in article 13 of the words “or nationals of the two contracting parties.” The former amendment, which seems innocuous, may be attributable to a desire on the part of Nuri Pasha to justify the declaration made before his departure of his intention to promote the cause of Arab unity. The second amendment, which extends to Iraq and Nejd nationals the restrictions which in the original draft were applicable only to foreigners, appears, at first sight, to conflict with article 6, which provides for complete freedom of movement of tribes for grazing purposes. I am advised, however, that the specific obliga tion involved in article 6 would be considered as overriding the general prohibition contained in article 13. 5. The Extradition Treaty provides in article 3 that the surrender of political offenders shall not be permissible. At the same time, as your Lordship will observe from the notes exchanged between Nuri Pasha and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hejaz-Nejd Government, the former has given an assurance that offences normally committed by Bedouin tribesmen fall within the category of extraditable offences and cannot be described as political. I see no objection to the nature of the assurance given by Nuri Pasha, and I consider that he is to be congratulated on having settled this vexed question, which has disturbed relations between Iraq and Nejd for many years. o' ^ regards the Ibn Mashhur affair, Nuri Pasha informs me that King Ibn Saud is now quite satisfied, and that with the surrender of his family and piopeity the affair will be considered closed. This is confirmed by His Majesty’s letter to myself. J J J 7. In legald to the balance of £23,000 outstanding in respect of the compensation to be paid by the Hejaz-Nejd Government for the Iraq tribes, Nuri Pasha informed me that King Ibn Saud did not attempt to deny the obligation o pay the amount m full. His Majesty explained, however, that owing to a temporary lack of ready money it would be necessary for him to borrow the money i e \\as to pay it to Nuri Pasha before the latter’s departure. Nuri 1G ^ 1G t l n J he i c l rcmns l' ance s, he would not press for immediate pay- of the nexPtwo months^ 6 ance ^ ue remitted to Bagdad in the course Hi^Tik J th® matter of customs and passport procedure was hi fnrnfshTJ satisfactory results, of which further information will, no doubt, fL ? fu Clal ■ Nuri Pasha me, also, that King Ibn Saud welcomed the proposed mission to the Yemen, and that, in regard toDr. Abdullah Darnluji, His Majesty was quite reconciled to the appointment of his former Minister to the Iraq Foreign Office, and did not desire to raise any objection on that score. 9. So far as I am able to judge at present, Nuri Pasha’s visit to the Hejaz seems to have been an unqualified success, and augurs well for the Iraqi Govern- n* -ft’s ability to control their relations with neighbouring States. I lost no time on the return of Nuri Pasha to Bagdad in conveying to him the message of congratulation from Plis Majesty’s Government contained in your Lordship’s telegram No. 148, dated the 19th April, 1931, a message which, as I have already reported to your Lordship, he greatly appreciated. 10.

Done in Mecca on the 21st of Dhul Qi'dat, 1349, a.h., corresponding with the 8th April, 1931, a.d. AS our efforts for the conclusion of an Extradition Treaty have been crowned with success, and in view of the desire expressed by His Majesty the King in the course of conversation between us on the morning of the 20th Dhul Qi’dat, 1349, that I should submit a special formal letter on the subject of offences committed by bedouins, I have the honour to submit to your Highness that offences normally committed by bedouins are bound to come within the acts of assault with violence, robbery, plunder, highway robbery, theft of the various kinds, wounding or murder, committed by one or more individuals against an individual or a group. I assure your Highness that all these offences and also that of raiding, which are provided for in the Bahra Agreement and in the Iraqi Law No. 47 of 1927 for the prevention of raids and plunder, are considered ordinary offences in respect of which extradition will be carried out, and which it is impossible to construe ” as political offences. I trust that this, my letter, will fully satisfy the desire of His Majesty the King. Please accept, &amp;c. Article 6. Article 7. Article 8. NUKT-AL-SAID. FEISAL ABDUL AZIZ. Enclosure 4 in No. 112.

I would like you to feel sure' that what you have stated in your letter will be scrupulously executed by us on the principle of reciprocity.

They are waiting for the amended text which is promised by Sir R. Bullard. Meanwhile I asked Mr. Brenan his views about the suggestion that there should be extradition and neighbourly relations agreements negotiated together with the anti-smuggling agreement, e.g. whether there were common form texts that could be used for the present purpose, or whether he felt that it would mean a long and intricate process of negotiation. Mr. Brenan said that the idea in the mind of the Foreign Office was that if these agreements had to be negotiated, the best plan would be to take the Saudi-Iraqi agreements and use them as a basis for Saudi-Koweit agreements. In view of the Saudi attitude, it may well be the best plan so far as H.M.G. are concerned to meet their request for the three agreements to be made simultaneously, since it would seem that if we do not there is no chance of getting the olockade question ^2. settled. I also discussed the question with Captain de Gaury on May 3rd. He said that in his opinion the Sheikh would he exceedingly unlikely to agree to conclude extradition and neighbourly relations agreements with Ibn saud. Captain de Gaury thought it very probable that Ibn Saud has in mind the Mutair tribe, which used at one time to owe allegiance to the Sheikh of Kov/eit but now are subject to Ibn Saud. The Sheikh of Koweit still cherishes a hope that he may eventually get this tribe back into his dominions, and is always ready to harbour Mutair malcontents. Ibn Saud, on the other hand, probably feels that if he has extradition etc. agreements with Koweit, he will be able tD insist on any such malcontents being handed over to him. Captain de Gaury felt that possibly it might meet Ibn Saud’ s point of view if H.M.G. give him an assurance that they regard the Mutair tribe as being permanently under his suzerainty and would use their good offices with a view to keeping this position stabilised. But he thought that any arrangement which would satisfy Ibn Saud in regard to this kind of matter v/ould not any/3 . any event be acceptable to the Sheikh of Koweit, and would either have to be done without his knowledge or imposed upon him. I suggested that the first alternative was hardly practicable; the second alternative seemed to attract Captain de Gaury. The signing on the Sheikh's behalf by H.M.G. of extradition and neighbourly relations agreements against his will, or some exchange of letters giving assurances to Ibn Saud in regard to the Mutair tribe, might perhaps be good ways of exerting H.M.G.’s authority over the Sheikh as part of a tightening up campaign. But no doubt H.M.G. would have to be sure that they would be able to compel the Sheikh to keep to such undertakings if given. h £ (liA* ., irzbd ct -la Wh r In any further coinrnunioufcion on this subject, please quote No - £, and address —not to any person by name, but to— * 'The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. 1 /, * 50 4 ° r 9 3 7 _J It THE Under-Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, « transmits herewith cop^6&lt;r of the under-mentioned paper.

Position is that the Saudi Government, vide paragraph No.5 of my express letter No.QOS-S, dated the 18th December, 1936, have put forward definite proposals for a trade agreement, which have been accepted by Sheikh with only one important exception, i«e.., Musabilah, for checking; of which Sheikh is willing to accept personal responsibility. 2. This being so it seems to me that Saudi Government, in order to avoid putting themselves in objectionable position of refusing to accept our perfectly reasonable proposal for a trial run of a few months, are deliberately manufacturirg; excuses. Bon voiaina&amp;re and extradition, vide paragraph No.7 of Yusuf Yasin ? s letter of August 17th, 1936, were merely suggested for consideration after trade agreement had come into force and were not included in terms of that agreement.

[Designation) /2. the crux of the question* I agree with the Shaikh that it would be quite impracticable to insist that each Bedouin should have a written permission to make his daily purchases. On the other hand I appreciate the Saudi point of view, which is presumably that by the Bedouin making a large number of small purchases, excessive to their needs, stores could be accumulated in the desert to be smuggled across the frontier as oppor tunity offered. The only solution appears to be that suggested by the Shaikh,eo that he and his officials will exercise a personal check on such purchases. D of Political Agent's letter.

The Saudi proposal that every caravan should be accompanied by a special officer of the Government of Kuwait or the baudi Arab Government to fixed frontier posts. Your Excellency pointed out that it was not clear whether the Gaudi proposal meant that Eaudi officials should accompany caravans from the frontier to Kuwait and back to the frontier. If the proposal meant this then Your Excellency could not agree to it since once the caravans were on the Kuwait side of the frontier, the responsibility for their surveillance and safe conduct was obviously yours, and you could not allow officials of foreign Government to exercise authority in your territory. The Resident asked what were your views if the Saudi Government meant that caravans should be accompanied by Kuwaiti officials. Your Excellency said that you did not see any useful object in this proposal, as the caravan leaders would be proviaed with manifests from which the goods with the caravan could f easily be checked. However, if the Saudi Government laid store by this you were prepared to agree, at any rate *or the trial period of six months which is mentioned oelow. fl 71 th regard to the Sa udi proposal to limit the number of caravans pe r month. Your Hxcellaacy stated in paragraph of your letter quoted above that ttoe limitation of .aravans would hinder trade. The Resident is of the opinion that somesome limitation of caravans is necessary for the working of the system, but that their number is a detail which can be settled according to requirements of trade tfien the Agreement came into force, C. That no Bedouin should be allowed to carry goods from Kuwait unless they hold a special written p er* mission from the ^audi frontier official concerned , also that such Bedouin should leave Kuvmit in caravans * Your ilsecelleney pointed out that this was impossible since large numbers of Bedouin corae daily into Kuwait to make small purchases, and it would be quite impracticable to insist that each of them should, have written permission for this purpose, or that they should leave Kuwait only in caravans• However Your Excellency was prepared to give a pledge that on this point, as on all others, you were prepared to do in your utmost to see that srauggling did not occur. In this connection Your Excellency pointed out that . 'i l ij you and your officials knew what the needs of the Bedouin were and we could check any excessive purchases which might be made with intent to smuggle. D. The Gaudi suggestion that there should be an agreement about the manner in which smugglers should be punished when they are Kuwaiti subjects and the manner in which fcmu^Iers should be punished when they are Saudi subjects. Your Excellency’s reply to this was that naturally the extent of the penalty would depend on the magnitude of the offence, and that you would use your discretion in inflicting suitable punishments. S. The Eaudi proposal as to control of goods which leave Kuwait by se a. Your Excellency quite agreed that this was reasonable precaution and that owners of hosts, on theiri on their return to Kuwait, should be in possession of a certificate to prove that the goods they carried to Saudi fw i„rab pogts reached theix* destination. 2. Finally the Resident expressed the opinion that the best course would be for the syst&lt; 3 n to be given trial for a period of (say) six months, during which it could be seen how the regulations worked in practice and whether any further points for settlement, which could not be foreseen now, would arise. At the end of that period either party woidi be free to denounce the Agreement with a view to the alteration of any part of the regulations which was found to be either unworkable or injurious to its interests. Your ihccellency agreed to this suggestion. 5* I i&amp;ould be grateful if Your Jixcellency would confirm that the above is a correct statement of your views* Usual ending.i . &gt;• * / Translation of a letter Mo.Ramadhan 1355 (oth I/eoem er 1936) from His excellency Shaikh Sir ^hxaad al Jabir as oulah, , o. j.i., Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

Bir, I have the honour to refer to your letter Ro.C~195 of the 2nd October 1936 and to say that I have ascertained His Excellency the Shaikh*s reactions to the first four paragraphs of the Saudi Hot© and that he has in this oonneoticx written to m© a letter a copy of which is attached# 2# On handing His nccellenoy the copy of the first four paragraphs of the ^audi Rote I pointed to what I said was an obvious slip in drafting in the penultimate sentence of para 2 of the note# The sentence beginning *Ko bedouin’* as it stood would mean if accepted, that no Bedouin even a Kuwaiti camped within two miles of the walls, could leave Kuwait without a pass from a Baudl Arab official# His Excellency on reading it said immediately ! *Hot a slip but intentional'. His Excellency in conversation later informed me that he feared that Ibn Baud instead of being content with the quite adequate regulations devised was, by an amendment, trying to achieve not simply the end of the blockade but increased influence and control over Kuwait# 3# His demand for an official to accompany the caravans was he thought dictated by this reason# Host caravans would start from a © ju, anci o&amp;ucii ..-Pad caravancaravan officials would thus predominate over the Kuwait ones in Kuwait, and soon he feared be unnecessarily officious in the exercise of their duties* Agreement to such a condition would also probably encourage the Iraq Government to press anew for their Customs Officer to be established in Kuwait. 4. Para 6 of His excellency f s reply attached seems reasonable. It would be inhuman to turn such poor creatures away. Ibn . aud, His .excellency thinks, here again sees a means of forcing the shaikh of Kuwait into carrying out, as if he were subordinate to Ibn Gaud, what is his, Xbn Saud ? s, own affair; the control of those from within his frontiers, who may wish to cross it either for legal or illegal purposes. His majesty as is well known already does so most effectively when he wishes. 5, Para 7 of His Excellency*s letter seems reasonable. An additional reason for having more frequent caravans is that camels often find only poor grassing near the walls here and caravans should therefore be free to leave as early s possible after being ready . Perhaps caravans twice a week would be suitable, if there must be fixed times. 5 . with regard to the matter of punishment His htcellenoy informs that on acceptance of the Regulations he is willing to agree to anything reasonable which His Majesty would apply to his own subjects. 7 # in short His hco8liency , 8 reaction to the note is this. He maintains that in return for a reasonable proposal, which would end the blockade and safeguard both parties the Mote betrays an anxiety to achieve more and gain what the blockade itself was perhaps largely designed to gain, i.e.i.e. a degree of 3audl control ovar Kuwait. B. HI 8 iiroallency thought from what he had heard that it was however only an attempt and that Ibn «aud was in reality prepared to agree to the original draft, if ne09s6ar3 and particularly at the present time. X have the honour to be, hir, Your most obedient servant, de r ue ^aury Captain, Political r^ent, Kuwait,5./ Translation of a oonfMential lot tor W@#B~§/&amp;gx f dated the B2nd Bajah corresponding to the 8th October 1936, from His hccallency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Poll 11 cal vgent, Kuwai t« iift ar Gomplimant s, X h: v e the honour to reply to your letter ho,G-886 dated the 17th Ha jab lob 5 (3*lQ*-36), 0 ; a body ing contents of tht oommunication received from Ilia Majesty iCing Abdul Aziz as- i, Saud through His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the Regulations for the Opening of Trade between Oaudi Arabia and Kuwait, which I have wall understood* 2. I would like to inform you that I appreciate the spirit of sympathy and amity shown during the discussions. At the same time I highly appreciate the great efforts that are being made by His Maj esty’a Government to get 4he to success the question of ’’Muaabala* between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 5* I assure to your Excellency that the proposals contained in the regulations forwarded under cover of my letter Iio.K-5/67, dated the 23rd Safer 1355 (14.5.36), will suffice to meet the case for safeguarding the interests of both sides. X again assure to your Excellency that I shall not fail to do the best in my power to protect the rights of all by all possible and effective means. 4. as for the supposition that there might be some people who would export goods in the name of ’Iraq, but who would smuggle them into Gaudi Arabia or elsewhere, this very unlikely. Moreover, both ours as well as Saudi Arab officials will be ^e to keep strict observation over such attempts. Nevertheless, I consider that it is ver^ unlikely that such a matter will arise, because it would be impracticable•ior Llio mention in the sbove comiiuiiiontion that every caravan should be accompanied by a special offi cial to the first province, and that such official should hold a list containing the number of camels of the caravan and the names of the persons thereof; should there be among them some person or persons whose names are not included in the list, and who carry goods with them, we would naturally consider them as smugglers, and that they should receive deterrent punishments# But I see no necessity for sending a special official in company with the caravan. The best way would be that the Head of the caravan should be made directly responsible for his caravan, ^.t the same time there should be a strict observation by the officials of both sides. Above all the triplicate manifest will exactly include all the goods, large and small, carried by the caravan. This will be a sufficient substitute for the company of any special official and any bill beside the abovementionad manifests. 6. In connection with the 'Musabala* (shopping or restocking) of the bedouins, I have no objection to their carrying papers from the Baud! Arab Posts or Stations. But in case of the arrival in Kuwait of individuals or parties of bedouins who could not conveniently call at the aboveraentioned stations, for the purpose of taking their provisions from Kuwait, it would not be of any good for either side to prevont such poor bedouins from taking their provisions. 7 . I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that limiting the number of journeys for caravans and notifying the Government of their departure would bo a hindrance to th© circulation of business dealings, and would affect the state of supply and demand in undue proportion particularly to small traders who are th© great ra&amp;jority. I trust that you will sympathize with me in the idea ofidea of avoiding anything which would tend to generate comoreial distress of the public* B * A® tihe suggestion that there should he an agreement about the wmmr in which smugglers should he punished when they are Kuwait subjects, and the manner in which smugglers should he punished when they are iiaudi subjects, such an agreement will be quite possible in the end* &amp;&gt;&amp; to what would be exported from Kuwait by sea to the laud!

We have now received a copy of the draft regulations which have been drawn up by the Sheikh of Koweit in conjunction with Captain de Gaury (see P.Z.3968/36). They have received the general approval of Colonel Powle and they seem to cover as far as possible the points raised by Fuad in his discussions with Sir Andrew Byan (see Jedda despatch No. 352). These regulations, if eventually accepted by the ! Saudi Government, will presumably have to be embodied into some kind of formal agreement. The form that this agreement should take will require consideration. Probably an exchange of notes between the Saudi Government and His Majesty*s Government will be the most suitable instrument on the analogy of the Bahrein Transit Dues Agreement, | although our control over the external relations of Koweit is not exactly on a par with our control over Bahrein. We shall have to thrash this matter out with the Foreign Office, who, I gather from informal discussion, are reluctant to take a definite line until Mr. Rendel returns from Montreux in about ten days* time. I do not think it is necessary to have reached a decision on this question before communicating the Sheikh*s draft regulations to the Saudi Government. We might therefore suggest to the Foreign Office that Mr. Calvert, who is at present in charge at Jedda, should be instructed to hand a copy of the regulations to the Saudi Government and ask for their I observations. 2956 6000 7/34Draft Paper.

The draft regulations prepared by the Sheikh in conjunction with the Political Agent at Koweit seem to cover fairly adequately the points raised by Fuad in the course of his conversations on this subject with Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh; and we think they offer a favourable basis for discussion with the Saudi Government. The regulations, when they have assumed a final form acceptaole both to the Saudi Government and to the Sheikh of Koweit, will ho itfmi sM~ parooumably have to be embodied in 8r I /j formal agreement, and the question will arise as to the form which this agreement should take. Qur previa that an exchange of notes between the Saudi Government and His J^jesty f s Government on behalf/6f the Sheikh of Koweit will be editable, but this question wifi no doubt require further consideration and the most suitable way of pdsaling with it would seem to be for fra-tro an i n-f^wrift 1 m nnt 1 n&gt; W 1 ‘Hi ^ Rendel/uiinda n gefi” _f T’QJ^ nt r eUJC. I not think, however, that it is essential to have reached a decision on this gupstios. before approaching the Saudi Government in regard /to the draft O-V Our general line has been to treat this question as urgent because Ibn Saud is supposed to be favourably disposed at the moment towards a final settlement of the Blockade question, V therefore suggest, if you agree, that Calvert might now be instructed to forward the draft regulations to the Saudi Government and ask them for their comments.

Your instructions were to ascertain precise significance of Saudi proposals. This would presumably mean asking Saudi Government to suggest nature of control to he imposed on persons and categories of persons to he subject to it. In other respects iuad s proposals were in my opinion clear. 2. Government of India go rather further and suggest Saudi Government should he asked alternatively to put forward precise draft, this would amount to asking them to make preliminary draft of future Koweit regulations which can surely best he done by Koweit authorities. 5. I evidently read too much into words report following''' in Koweit telegram to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 77. Last sentence of India Office telegram No. 260 to Political Resident in Persian Gulf and previous correspondence led me to expect that Sheikh of Koweit and British authorities in the Gulf would in the first instance produce scheme which they considered practicable on the basis of Fuad 1 s proiiosals and would assume control should be by passes or identity papers. 4 . Apart from considerations mentioned in my telegram No.42 I feel strongly that action contemplated in your instructions, especially i ^ Aj ;iven form suggested by Government . u t %i ; til* tltCG-OYerniiient of India will encourage Saudi G-overnment to open their mouths as wide as possible and. place the Sheikh of Koweit in a much worse tactical position than if he made his own draft regulations and left Saadi Government to suggest amendment or amplification. 5. I have now arranged to see Fuad April 12th, he could not in any case discuss this subject in detail before he leaves. I shall therefore unless instructed otherwise confine myself to telling him that formulation of precise scheme in Koweit has presented difficulty owing to doubt as to scope of his proposals and that I shall pursue the matter with Yusuf Yasin. Fresh starts will have to be made with latter. 6 . As I have infomed Iliad of Sheikh of Koweit ’ s acceptance of his proposal I trust points requiring elucida tion are limited to those indicated in paragraph 1 above and that the Sheikh of Koweit’s acceptance covers points dealt with in paragraphs 12 and 15 of enclosure to my despatch ho. 552. 7. Sheikh of Koweit seems to forget continuance of present situation suits the Saudi Government who have been induced only by strong pressure of His Majesty's Government to contemplate termination of blockade. If he now makes undue difficulty he may lose the chance of settlement altogether.

The question of the Saudi blockade was discussed by Sir Andrew Ryan with Fuad Hamza in the course of his visit to Riyadh^ aam goma progress was made. These conversations were reported by telegram (see P.Z.8878/35) whilst a full account will be found at P.Z.9394/35.

The exact nature of their alternative proposals is not yet clear, but / 3330 1000 12.34but a system of manifests is envisaged with classification of persons engaged in trade by nationality and place of residence, particular precautions against fraud, the specification of fixed routes, the extension of the manifest system to dhows and presumably Saudi Customs posts.

Fuad tells me that the King has been greatly gratified by his reception at Koweit and has instructed him to exert himself to facilitate settlement of blockade question. He enquired as to the position regarding proposals which emerged from our conversations in Riyadh. I explained that they were still being considered by competent authorities. In view of the above I think that it would be well so pursue blockade question officially as soon as possible.

India Office telegram ho. 158 to G-overnment of India, second half of paragraph one* I agree that Saudi customs post would be a necessary part of system the object of which would be to ensure movement of trade through such post. I think that the India Office interpretation of sugges cion at the end of paragraph 10 of enclosure of my despatch ho. 352 may be too wide. I should prefer, if possible, to arrive at positive definition of categories of persons who would be required to hold passes or identity papers rather than make this requirement generally subject to exception. I myself received suggestion as applying to persons engaged in trade but I foresee difficulty regarding what may be largest category of all viz. tribesmen carrying goods for their own use. I purposely avoided any close discussion with Fuad , of the categories of persons to be controlled as I feared that Ion Baud might be seizing the opportunity afforded by the blockade negotiations to revert to the suggestions in the correspondence ending with enclosure in Jedda despatch No, 256 which would involve excessive restriction on movements across the frontier. There may be better chance of avoiding such excessive restriction when memory of the controversy over incident of May 6th is less fresh in the mind of the King. If the latter visits Koweit it may also help. In view of the above considerations I should prefer to await general reaction of Sheikh of Koweit before asking Fuad &lt; • to elucidate his suggestion further.

I have underlined our additions in pencil for your convenience; the new paragraph 4 and the expansion oi paragraph 5 are on the lines suggested in Rendel s letter to Walton E 7570/206/35 of the 8th, and we hope that you will be able to agree (you will notice that we have avoided giving tuiy definite expression of opinion in paragraph 5 about the 'Highness' proposal). Our idea in replacing 'trader' by 'person xu the middle of paragraph 1 is that since (we understand) out by tribesmen buying small quantities of goods in Koweit 'trader' could hardly be used for a wide system ox conorol trade (and smuggling) with the Beduln tribes is mainly carried end retailing them later out in the desert, the designation suchsuch as the Sa.u&amp;is appear to envisage. The addition about the customs posts on Saudi territory seems to us desirable so that that aspect of the matter shall not be lost sight of in the general scheme. We have ventured to replace the last two sentences in your paragraph 1 by the passage “Minister at Jedda .....Sheikh” a^it seems to us that we ought to give Ryan &amp;he main chance to say whether our interpretation is correct, since he alone is really in a position to understand (if anybody can do so !) just what the Saudis are aiming at. This note is purely personal and in place -of a telephone conversation, and I am not keeping a textual cbpy on our files. Perhaps you would ring me up later today ? I am due to go over to the Iraqi section next week and I should like to get the next stage of this question complete first; moreover I always fear that if we delay somebody will introduce new complications by further correspondence !

The supplementary instructions which were sent to him in our despatch No.524 of 7th November (please see our official letter E 6475/206/25 of the same date) were evidently useful and it is satisfactory to know that Ibn Saud seems at least to have realised that we feel strongly on the subject. 2. ■ Our first impression is that the general basis at which Ryan arrived with Fuad Hamza for a resumption of the negotiations is promising, and that we can give it our blessing/ , Esq. , G.B., M.C. COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL I r . *5 *1 7 £ or 1 b WO V2 . ^ ,T I ■ |» 'n htiblessing in principle, subject, of course, to the views of the authorities in the Gulf and to satisfactory arrangements being found possible for the system of control on the Saudi-Koweit frontier envisgaged by Fuad Hamza. 3. As regards the particular points in Ryan’s despatch, we thinlv that there is much force in the suggestion in paragraph 6 that it would be preferable to resume negotiations through the Legation at Jedda, since we feel that this is likely to lead to their being conducted in a calmer and more reasonable spirit than would be the case if they were left to another local conference betv/een Arab delegations. 4. I am not sure whether I entirely agree with the suggestion which Ryan makes in paragraph 7 that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrain should have the title of ,, Highness ,, conferred upon them. It is not so much that suggestion itself which I question as the motive on which it appears to be based. It seems to us that there would be considerable risk in doing anything to emphasize the importance of these Sheikhs 'as independent rulers', since, although/t V* &lt;¥- &amp; ' v A w ,.(&lt;; vW' n , j-t-rii although we wish to emphasise their independence of Saudi Arabia and of Irag, I think you will agree that we certainly do not wish to weaken in any way their dependence on His Majesty’s Government. On the contrary I think we are all in agreement that we should aim at tightening up our control over the Sheikhs; and it is surely as part of this policy that we have so long been insisting that all political correspondence between them and Ibn Saud must pass through us. Apart from this general consideration might it not be very difficult to accord a rise in dignity to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrain without doing likewise to the Sheikh XT of Qatar, whose reputation and conduct seems very far from meriting such a distinction? Moreover, the lesser Trucial fry would probably also begin to agitate for a rise in status.! 5. The only remaining individual point upon which we wish to comment at this stage is that ot a time limit ior anyf eventual agreement with the Saudi Government, which Ryan raises in paragraph 8 of the record of conversations enclosed in his despatch. We think that Ryan’s suggestion may Drove a useful inducement to the Saudis to conclude an agreement/ k Ifagreement, and while we naturally would not wish to encourage the Saudis to denounce any agreement that we were eventually able to put through, we feel it is impossible to expect the Saudis to tie themselves down to an agreement of a perpetual character. You will remember that a provision of the nature suggested by Ryan was inserted in the Bahrain Transit Dues agreement in deference to the wishes of the Bahrain Government, and we do not think that we can consistently deny the same privilege to the Saudis if it was to their advantage in the present case, 6 . The question now arises of the procedure for pursuing the negotiations further. You will remember that when we saw Powle’s express letter No. 958-S of the 10th December (a copy of which was enclosed in your official letter P. Z. 9042 of 18th December), in which he proposed to instruct Dickson to approach the Sheikh of Koweit immediately the full record of Ryan’s conversations reached him, v/e suggested to you that it would he desirable to hold up local action in the Gulf until we had had an opportunity in London to examine the results of Ryan’s negotiations, and.to prepare a preliminary expression of the views of His/His Majesty’s Government. You agreed with our suggestion and sent your telegram No. 4088 of the 24th December to ibowle, warning him to delay the approach'to the Sheikh until receipt of the comments of His Majesty’s Government. 7* we have, therefore, now to concert a communication to Fowle giving him a preliminary expression of the views of His Majesty’s Government and instructing him to go ahead with the consultation of the Sheikh of Koweit. If you agree generally with the views I have expressed in paragraphs 2-5 aoove, I suggest for your consideration tnat the best course might now be to prepare in the first instance a draft express letter or telegram to Fowle, in which you would no doubt give us an opportunity of concurring. Obviously any views expressed on the Saudi proposals could only be general and preliminary in character, and we shall have to leave it to the authorities in the Gulf to make detailed criticisms and suggestions for the necessary arrangements for putting them into effect, if possible. But, if you see no objection, we should like to take up the three individual points mentioned in paragraphs 3,4 and 5 above. Yours sincerely,4 I' 4289 5000 12.35 Draft Paper. POLITICAL Department.

The Saudi Blockade post there, under the command of the now notorious Haif Abu Shijera (the individual who caused all the trouble at Subahiyeh last May when he crossed the border and tried to eject Shammar camped there), tried to prevent some Kuwait Rishaida from drinking at the Rigai water hole. This'they had no right to do by Desert law and a scuffle ensued resulting in Haif T s men seizing a camel and a hav/k from the Rishaida. As the incident might easily have ended in serious reprisals, the Shaikh sent out A1 tafisi r s son to interview Haif and his men and settle the matter amicably. The result was the restitution of tlx- camel and hav/k. ommfa* xhe presence of Haif Abu Shijera on the frontier is being watched, as men of his kidney are apt to cause trouble.

After various preliminaries 1 discussed this question with i’uad on November 26th and November 27th. I applied strongest possible pressure to dislodge Saudi Government from position that any agreement should be conditional on guarantee by Noweit that no smuggling whatever should take place. I proposed exchange of notes on the basis of Koweit delegate's letter of June 17th plus Sheikh's honourable undertaking and assurance by His Majesty's Government on the lines of Charge d ! Affaires' note to Saudi Government of August 12th. I added that I would personally recommend provision to enable either side to terminate the agree ment at short notice as in the case of Bahrein notes but that I did not know how His Majesty's Government would view/ this. 2. Eventually Fuad abandoned the guarantee previously demanded but asked that agreement on the lines suggested should be supplemented by provisions for ( 1 ) control of persons engaged.in trade who should be classified by nationality and place of residence; ( 2 ) precautions against fraud e.g. by persons professing to be bound for Iraq but intending to enter Saudi-Arabia; (3) specification of fixed routes; and (4) extension of manifest system to dhows. 3. I undertook to have these suggestions studied. Feeling that suggestions regarding control of persons might conceal fresh attempto attempt to restrict all movements across the frontier, I made it clear that 1 regarded them as applying only to persons handling cvmeTchandize who would have to he definedo 4 „ I found it better tactics to negotiate through ruad although at one , point I threatened to seek audience for dis cussion of the question with the King personally. then Fuad reached position described in paragraph 2 above I assumed general sympathetic attitude, but was careful not to commit Koweit to a scheme which it may be difficult to reduce to practical form. I suggest preliminary consideration should be given without delay to Fuad 1 s suggestions, but that no decision should be taken pending receipt of fuller record of my conversa tions which will go by next bag.

But I confess that I am somewhat puzzled by paragraph 3 of your letter* Ae a mere point of terminology, the ^concessions** to be offered to Ibn Baud in respect of his Eastern frontiers have, as 1 understand, been consistently described as such by the Foreign Office representatives on the Middle Bast Committee, and they are still so described in the Sir L.Oliph? nt, KCMG.,CB* Foreign Office. despatch/v y 2. despatch to Ryan of 23rd October. For example, in paragraph 13 of the latter it is emphasised that the offer now to be made represents ”a final concession'. And going beyond terminology to the question of substance, I must say that we should hesitate to concur in your view that we are only giving Xbn Baud what he has in practice got already, and this does not seem to have been the Foreign Office view in the recent past. As Hendel pointed out at the meeting of 15th April, Thomas, travelling along meridian 51^,- had hardly come within Ibn Baud’s authority. Granted that Ibn Baud may have acquired some prescriptive rights in a limited area east of the Blue Line, it does not follow that he actually exercises full sovereignty over anything like the area where we are now proposing to recognise it. 1 thought, in fact, that it was agreed that he does not do so. If B large part of this area is in reality (es has hitherto been held) a no man’s lend, there is on the merit© « i.e. apart from the desirability of making a 'concession' to Ibn Baud - no more reason for recognising it as belonging to him than to anyone else. In our view, therefore, the attitude that we were merely/A- • other questions should not be discussed at the same time. CWill you kindly look at Walton’s letter No.P.Z.7691/35 of the 28th October to Rendel, on the subject of the Saudi blockade of Koweit? In the instructions finally issued to Ryan practically all the amendments which Walton proposed were adopted, and I hope that Ryan will be able to effect a real improvement in the situation while at Riyadh. 2. In support of his suggested amendments, however, Walton used some arguments which do not appear very con vincing to me. Not for one moment do I wish to start an unnecessary controversy but the points in question are not of merely academic interest, and I do not feel I ought to let them pass without comment. ( 3. It is generally agreed that the areas over which we are now ready to recognise Ibn Baud's sovereignty are not areas over vdiich sovereignty could be claimed on behalf of any of our Arab protege s of the Persian Gulf, and a fortiore still less on our own behalf. Surely then what we have resolved to do is merely to recognise officially the... Sir L. Wakely, K.C.I.E. , C.B.^ ‘ ■ O'? i the fact that Ihn Saad has, hy prescription, already aaquired in those areas rights of a sovereign land which would, of course, he in no wise affected if we chose not to recognise them. This being so, how can His M a^'esty’s Government claim to be in a position to maintain (as suggested in paragraph 3 of Walton's letter) that they are in fact making 'substantial concessions' such as would entitle them to expect favours in return from Ibn Saud who. by the same token, will certainly not regard himself as in any way beholden on this account to His Majesty's Government. We are in fact merely 'giving' him what is certainly not ours to give, and what in practice he has already got. 4. Hor these reasons the suggestion made by Howie in his telegram No.892 of the 25th October, and taken up by the Government/of India in their telegram No.2974 of the 30th October, namely that the Koweit blockade question should be expressly linked to the question of the 'Blue Line ' seems to me impracticable, and in any case unlikely to achieve the object we have in view. 5. In paragraph 3 of his letter, Walton al^o suggested that Byan might use as a lever to raise the blockade of...HiForeign Office, S.W.l. of Koweit the proposal, already under negotiation, that • ^ His Majesty’s Government might abandon the right of manumitting slaves at present exercised by the Legation at Jedda. Let me then explain briefly the reasons for which we could not entertain this suggestion. 6 , This right of manumission, as no doubt you know, is detested by the Saudi Government who regard it (not without reason) as a derogation of their sovereign independence. It is in any case a right the continued existence of which is at the best precariously assured and the exercise of which is always liable to give rise, as it has on various occasions in the past, to a sudden political storm. - Moreover, the material effect on slavery in Saudi Arabia generally which can be produced by the freeing of some thirty slaves a year at Jedda is, as you will realise, not very noticeable. In these circumstances it was decided last year that His Majesty 1 s Government would be justified in accepting as a basis for negotiation the Saudi Government’s suggestion that this right of manumission should be renounced in return for the promulgation by Ibn Saud of general anti-slavery regulations, provided these could...0 could be shown to constitute an adequate stex^ forward in the right direction. Negotiations for this purpose were, however, only authorised on the express condition that our right of manimission should not be thrown on the market to see what it would fetch but should be traded, if at all, solely against a Saudi anti-slavery regulation such as would be at least as effective as the right of Eianuniission in securing the actual reduction and alleviation of slavery in Saudi Arabia. 6 . r fhis transaction must thus be kept distinct and entirely separate from all others. 6THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 8419/206/25] Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir A. Ryan (on leave). (No. 317.) Foreign Office, October 31, 1935. YOU will shortly be the guest of King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh. While there, you will be engaged in further negotiations on the subject of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, and on the subject of slavery, on both of which matters you have already received full instructions. 2. Though it is to be expected that these topics will occupy a great part of the time available for political discussion at Riyadh, nevertheless I request that you will not fail at the same time to use every endeavour to secure an adequate settlement from King Abdul Aziz on the subject of his blockade of Koweit. As you are aware, this blockade has now been maintained for more than ten years, and as long ago as 1929 His Majesty’s Government promised the Sheikh of Koweit, in return for his co-operation which was loyally given in the interests of Ibn Saud during the Ikhwan rebellion, that they would do their best to secure an honourable settlement of the question. During his visit to London this year the sheikh received assurances, to which he attaches the highest value, of the interest of His Majesty’s Government in his affairs. I enclose a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 892 of the 25th October, 1935), which emphasises how unfortunate would be the reactions in Koweit and in the Persian Gulf generally of any failure to secure a settlement of the blockade question in the course of the Anglo-Saudi negotiations now in progress. On account of the political and strategic importance of Koweit (both actual and potential) His Majesty’s Government are anxious to strengthen their friendly relations with its ruler. Eor this and for other reasons they are bound in pursuance of their promises to him to make every effort to secure a satisfactory settlement and to defend his legitimate interests vis-a-vis his powerful neighbour. 3. You will recollect that the conference between Saudi and Koweiti delegates, held at Koweit in the early part of the summer, dispersed without achieving a settlement. From the series of letters exchanged by the delegations, of which I enclose copies for your convenience, you are aware that King Abdul Aziz was ready to agree to the proposed method of controlling Saudi-Koweiti trade, namely, that trade should be directed to one or more customs posts on the Saudi side of the frontier and that all exports should be provided with manifests issued by the Sheikh of Koweit. You will recall, however, that His Majesty attached to his acceptance the condition that this arrangement should be auto matically terminated if, after its institution, a single Koweiti was detected smuggling. This demand the sheikh could not, of course, accept; but he offered, as an alternative, a guarantee on his honour that he would do all in his power to stop smuggling and would severely punish offenders. King Abdul Aziz then declared this offer to be inadequate and instructed his delegates to break off the negotiations. 4. The matter was then taken up in London during the conversations last summer with Fuad Bey Hamza, the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs at which you yourself were present. It was explained to him that‘the Saudi Government’s demand was most unreasonable, since no State, not even the most highly organised, was in a position to give a guarantee that not a single case would occur of its regulations being evaded, and he was informed that if Kino- Abdul Aziz would accept the sheikh’s alternative offer of an honourable under taking His Majesty’s Government for their part would do all in their power to ensure its observance. Fuad Bey, before leaving London, promised to look into the matter. 5. After some time had elapsed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda. acting on my instructions, invited the Saudi Government to give him their views on the matter m the light of the consideration which it had doubtless received [531 hh-H] r~7' k~ h / . Q October 31, 1935. Section 1. D2 J in consequence of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza in London. Mr. Calvert drew the Saudi Government s attention once more to the importance which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India attach to a solution of this problem and reiterated the willingness of His Majesty’s Government to do all in their power to ensure that the honourable undertaking offered by the sheikh should, if accepted, be observed. 6. Of this communication, which was dated the 12th August, no mention was made when the Saudi Government informed Mr. Calvert in a note dated the 1st September that in view of the increase in smuggling which the Saudi Govern ment alleged had taken place since the breakdown of the Koweit conference (but which was denied from Koweiti sources) they intended to enforce an even closer blockade and virtually to prohibit all movement across the Saudi-Koweiti frontier. The Saudi Government were, therefore, reminded on the 16th September that a reply to Mr. Calvert’s previous representations was still outstanding and they were warned that if they insisted on demanding impossible conditions from Koweit they would assume the sole responsibility for the present unsatisfactory situation. Copies of these two notes are enclosed. 7. On the 15th October the Saudi Government addressed to Mr. Calvert a note in reply to the above-mentioned communications. From the summary telegraphed by Mr. Calvert, the Saudi Government appear to have asserted that they had not sought to interfere in the affairs of Koweit and that responsibility for the present situation and for the loss which had been caused to Saudi Arabia thereby thus rested with Koweit and (as it would appear from oral explanations furnished by the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs) with His Majesty’s Government. They maintained, moreover, that the demands made by the Saudi delegation at the Koweit Conference might justifiably have been severer but that they were none the less reasonable in that they would have entailed loss to Saudi commerce and represented the utmost sacrifice which could be made. The Saudi Government expressed regret that such sacrifices should have been characterised as unreasonable, and their note concluded by asserting that agreement on the matter would only be possible if Koweit were to give the required guarantee absolutely to prevent all smuggling. 8. Such arguments are unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government, who can only regard this note as evidence of an unsatisfactory and indeed obstructive attitude on the part of the Saudi Government. In particular, insistence on a literal acceptance of the condition which King Abdul Aziz seeks to attach to an agreement is manifestly unreasonable. I shall accordingly be glad if you will draw the serious attention of King Abdul Aziz to the matter at Riyadh. 9. You should begin, as on previous occasions, by reminding the King of the unremitting efforts which His Majesty’s Government made to improve and consolidate relations, first between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and then between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. These efforts proved successful, and have led to settlements which have been to the great advantage of all the parties concerned. His Majesty’s Government are now most earnestly desirous of bringing about a similar improvement in the case of relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Aware or the many bonds which have linked those two Arab States in the past, His Majesty s Government are sincerely anxious to see relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit placed once more on a normal and friendly footing. His Majesty s Government cannot but feel that, with this object achieved, their iriendship for both parties will nave been most strikingly demonstrated. 10. You should then briefly remind King Abdul Aziz of the recent conterence and of the subsequent action of His Majesty’s Government and repeat with as much emphasis as you deem prudent the views of His Majesty’s Govern- !Yl ; r?f' t ® S ua . r antee demanded of the sheikh by the Saudi delegation, and now nsisted on in the Saudi Government’s note summarised in paragraph 7 above. &lt;min nnibin^K ™ 6 ' 1 to t . pomt out H is Majesty, if you think fit, that he stands to to sHw it bfA on f, n absolute guarantee, since, even if the sheikh were won d be’bG dnH? ell T y f T U u n0t ’ T, th the utmost goodwill, achieve more than alternative and f' y tt - 6 honourable undertaking which he has offered as an K ^ A,i W u 11 HlS M A s Ys Government are prepared to endorse. or Govtrnmint rnubi h a PP re ® 1 . at ® the fact that the sheikh, like any other ruler or Government, could but use his utmost endeavours in either event ' Maiestv’s Government 11 K i ng ‘H’ in the considered opinion of His Majesty s Government, the sheikh’s offer of an honourable undertaking to do so,3 i divert i His ^ this all in ilieikh ention -ed the I rovern- ce (but i closer rontier. 1 that a fid they is from sfactory ialvert a iummary ’ted that msibility i Arabia lanatioas Majesty’s ;he Sai r but that i to Saudi Che Saudi lacterised int on tls guaraute t, whoca Astructra tence oui j i attach i lad if n iyadh. re King of aprove and en betwefi ,d have led i concerned ug about* nd Koweft- n the ifeen Said )ting. 01i eved. d. the reeeo' and rep^ 1 &gt; s Govero- i and no'' A 7^' 9 stand* tc leikhf more th* 1 med n s ® , endof ;her rnle r mofH is to d° ^ coupled with their own good offices, would give him all the assurance which is either necessary or obtainable. 1 trust that these arguments will not fail of their effect, but if they do, you may use your discretion to inform King Abdul Aziz that His Majesty’s Government regard this matter as a test of his desire to establish Anglo-Saudi relations on an even more cordial basis than at present, and that it will increase the beneficial effects of your visit to His Majesty if it results in a happy solution of this long-standing and dangerous dispute. 12. There is one further argument of which you may find it possible to make some general use in conversation with King Abdul Aziz or with his Ministers. In his despatch No. 256 of the 10th September, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires mentioned that Sheikh Muhammad Tawil, the Saudi Director of Customs in Hasa, ha a expressed himself to a member of His Majesty’s Legation as being in favour of a radical reduction of Saudi customs dues, a policy which he professed to have recommended to King Abdul Aziz. There appears to be little doubt that such a policy, if applied, would remove the cause of much of the smuggling which is now carried on into Saudi Arabia from Koweit, by reducing the disparity between the Saudi and the Koweiti customs dues. This policy would also encourage importers to land their goods on the Saudi coast rather than at Koweit, and would thus tend to promote one at least of the objects for which it is understood the present Saudi blockade of Koweit was instituted. I fear that it would be too much to expect that King Abdul Aziz can be easily induced to see the unwisdom of maintaining his customs duties at an almost prohibitive level, but I consider that, subject to your views, there may be advantage in explaining this aspect of the matter to him. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE. (Secret.) Enclosure 1. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India. (No. 892.) ('Telegraphic.) ^ ^ Risher, October 25, 1935. ADDRESSED to Secretary of State for India and repeated to Government of India, Jedda. Copy by mail, Koweit. ^Jedda telegram No. 192 to the Foreign Office: Koweit blockade. Attitude of Saudi Government, which is apparently still that by which they deliberately torpedoed Koweit Conference, is most disappointing. 2. Sheikh, on my return through Koweit, again appealed to me most earnestly on question of blockade. As result of his conversations in England he has evidently high hope that His Majesty’s Government mean to implement their assurance on the subject of blockade, and failure to do so now on our part, even though circumstances may be difficult, will mean that his trust in our’ good intentions towards him will receive a severe and most undesirable shock, which will have repercussions in other Arab States of the Gulf. 3. I quite realise the importance of treating Ibn Sand liberally, but I have always felt (see, for instance, my telegram of the 8th June, T-112) that Koweit blockade should be made the acid test of desire of Saudi Government for our friendship. I venture to suggest, therefore, whether, in view of persistent unfriendly attitude of the Saudi Government over this point, it would not be [ ? equitable] for [ ? Ryan] on his coming visit to Riyadh to intimate to Ibn Sand that any new offer from His Majesty’s Government regarding the blue line [? to-day] is dependent on Ibn Sand adopting a reasonable attitude towards the eminently practicable suggestion of the sheikh regarding [? manifests] et cetera (vide paragraph No. 3 of sub-enclosure to my printed letter of 28th June). b 2 [531 hh—1]Enclosure 2.

These are as follows : — (1) That customs collecting centres should be established within the frontiers of His Majesty the King. These may consist of one post or more than one, and in such places as His Majesty the King may choose. (2) That his Excellency Sheikh Ahmad-al-Jabir shall, for his part, assist to the best of his power in the control and guiding of all exports to the above posts or centres. This will be by means of manifests, which will be issued in triplicate; the first copy to go with the goods, the second to be handed over to His Majesty’s local agent, Abdulla-an-Nafisi, and the third one to remain in the customs office of the local Government. The above is the opinion we hold, and the procedure is one which is recognised between kingdoms and nations that are good neighbours, as well as by others.

WITH reference to the discussion which we had with you to-day in regard to the resumption of “ Musabalah ” ( cc trade ”) between our country and Koweit, we beg to reiterate in writing, in addition to what we explained verbally, the good intentions of our Government, and the affectionate spirit, friendliness, and good feeling which they have towards the Koweit Government, and to say that they (the Saudi Government) are prepared to continue conversations with a view to arriving at a satisfactory conclusion between both sides, and to discuss measures to remove all misunderstanding for the future. Such conversations, however, must be on the one clear basis, that the Government of Koweit shall give £ ‘ guarantee (“ dhaman ”) with regard to goods passing (across frontier) to His Majesty the King’s territory (i.e., that nothing is smuggled apart from goods sent under manifests). This, indeed, is what we proposed in the course of our discussions with you.5 Should your esteemed delegation agree to negotiate on this basis, we are prepared once more to discuss the subject in order to arrive at the conclusion sought by both sides. -yc: (Usual ending.) Note by Political Agent. —The above letter, as will be seen, is worded some what differently from what the Saudi delegate laid down as the only basis for future talks (see my telegram No. 211 of the 25th June), namely, that Koweit must agree before anything else to guarantee that not even a single smuggler got across the border. They appear to be playing for safety. The Koweit delegates have not missed this point, and in their reply have pinned the Saudi delegates down to what they actually did say. HI.— Translation of a Letter dated the Hkth Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 25, 1935), from the Koweit Delegation to the Saudi Delegation. (After compliments.) WE have received your esteemed letter dated the 23rd Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 24, 1935), and have understood what you stated as to your good intentions as well as the good intentions of His Majesty King Ibn Sand’s Government, namely, that you are prepared to continue conversations with a view to arriving at a satisfactory conclusion between both sides, and to discuss measures to remove all misunderstanding, but that such conversations must from now onward be on the one basis, that the Government of Koweit shall first give “ guarantee ” (“ dhaman ”) with regard to goods (smuggled) passing across the frontier. You added that if our delegation would agree to the “guarantee ” condition on behalf of the Koweit Government, then you would be prepared to continue the talks. We wish, therefore, now to make the matter quite clear. The situation is, as we suggested to you in our letter dated the 16th Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 17, 1935), and as was also discussed with you in yesterday morning’s meeting (June 24, 1935). You stated that the “ guarantee ” system was desired by His Majesty’s (Saudiyeh) Government, which was that nothing should be smuggled, and only goods exported according to manifests should be allowed to pass into Saudi territory. That should any smuggler be caught, his goods would be confiscated, and the Koweit Government would have to pay the customs duty imposed on same. Also that should this happen more than three times, His Majesty’s Saudi Govern ment should have the right to cancel the agreement. At the same meeting we replied to you that the Koweit Government would give you their word of honour to do all in their power to prevent smuggling. And that should any smuggling be discovered (within her territory) the Koweit Govern ment would inflict the severest of punishments on the evil-doer. As regards the “guarantee” insisted on by you—with every precaution taken and every goodwill, we say this cannot be realised. Hence it is not reason able of you to make such a condition. That which the Saudi Government is afraid of (e.g., smuggling), should it occur, will be trifling and very small* because of the measures that will be taken by His Majesty’s Saudi Government and the Govern ment of Koweit. It should certainly not affect the goodwill, and the desire for a reciprocal agreement between His Majesty the King and his Excellency Sheikh Ahmad-al-J abir. We have every hope, however, that owing to your deep insight you will not allow a doubtful and unreasonable defect to stand in the way of good understanding. We beg for a reply to this, and express the hope that we shall come to a good understanding. (Usual ending.)6 XV.

Therefore, we request that you will kindly inform us m clear manner as to your final decision, either you should agree to the £C guarantee ” basis, or decline from it, in this way the situation will be made quite clear, and we can submit a report to our Government.

WE have received your letter dated the 24th Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 25, 1935), in reply to our letter of the same date, from which we understand that you consider our reply not to be clearly put, and that you now wish to be informed definitely whether we agree to the ct guarantee 5 5 basis or not, in order that you may submit a report to your Government. Contrary to what you say, we believe that we have made the position quite clear, and have not been obscure. We explained to you that the “ guarantee ” basis, which you demanded in yesterday’s meeting, could not possibly be realised; in spite of every good intention and effort on our part; for, as we explained, the first case of smuggling that occurred would not only upset the plan, but would tend to have exactly the opposite result where the good agreement and connexions desired by both His Majesty’s Saudi Government and our Government are con cerned. Therefore, you should either make propositions different to the above, or submit your present proposal, together with our reply to it, to your Government. We leave that to you. (Usual ending.)

WITH reference to the information you imparted to us in to-day’s meeting, that His Majesty the King would not agree to the resumption of trade between Koweit and the Saudi Arabia save on the “ guarantee ” basis on the part of the Koweit Government. As you know, we have written a letter to you, dated the 16th Rabi Auwal, 1354 (June 17, 1935), in which we stated the views we considered good for both countries. On the other hand, in the meeting of the 21st instant (June 22, 1935), you demanded^ a guarantee,” and we stated in our letter of the 24th instant (June 25, 1935) that that guarantee ” was impossible to give, as it could not practically or theoretically be enforced. In a second letter, also dated the 24th instant (June 25, 1935) we asked you to submit both your proposition of “guarantee” and our reply to it, to His Majesty the King. r vIf His Majesty the King, as you informed us definitely and verbally to-day was the case, does not agree to anything but that we give the £ ‘ guarantee ’ 5 asked for, then all that is left for us is to make it known that we cannot commit ourselves to any such £C guarantee.” Although we recognise that His Majesty the King and his Excellency the Sheikh Ahmad-al-Jabir are as brothers, and that there is no difference between our two countries and the two peoples, nevertheless we regret the failure of negotiations. We do not entirely despair, however, and still hope for agreement. We look to this conference as a first step to the understanding desired. May God destine agreement. Please acknowledge our letter.

I HAVE the honour to refer to the communications which have passed between the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs and this Legation regarding the Koweit Conference, ending with the telephone message from Asad Bey A1 Faqih of the 7th July last, informing me that the Saudi delegates had returned to Riyadh upon the breakdown of the conference. 2. Your Royal Highness is, of course, aware that this question was recently the subject of further conversations in London between the departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned and his Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza, who, as a result, undertook to refer the matter again to the Saudi Government for their consideration. I am now instructed to enquire whether your Royal Highness’s Government are in a position to place me in possession of their views on this question, in the light of the renewed consideration they have doubtless given to it consequent upon the London conversations. 3. I feel impelled once more to draw the attention of your Royal Highness to the importance which my Government and the Government of India attach to the settlement of this question, and I would strongly urge the Saudi Government to agree to the proposals put forward by the delegation of his Excellency the Sheikh of Koweit at the recent conference. For their part, I assure your Royal Highness, as his Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza was similarly assured in London, my Government would do all they could to ensure the fulfilment of the honourable undertaking offered by his Excellency the Sheikh, which in their view is all that can reasonably be demanded.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Royal Highness’s note of the 2nd Jumad-ath-Thani, relative to the present position with regard to Koweit, a summary of which was duly communicated by telegraph to His Majesty’s Government. I am now instructed to state in reply that my Govern ment have nothing to add to the views expressed in my note of the 5th August last concerning the incident of the armed party which entered Koweit territory, which question they now regard as closed. 2. In regard to the question of the blockade, His Majesty’s Government are surprised to learn of the alleged increase of smuggling from Koweit and of the intention of the Saudi Arab Government to restrict intercourse with Koweit still further. As his Excellency Fuad Rey Hamza was informed in London, my Government consider that the demand of the Saudi Arab Government that a guarantee be given by Koweit that no smugglers shall cross the frontier is unreasonable, and they regret to observe that no consideration has apparently been given to my note of the 12th August. 3. My Government, therefore, desire to draw the attention of the Saudi Arab Government once again to the importance they attach to the settlement of this question and to the proposals contained in my note of the 12th August. If the Saudi Arab Government insist on impossible conditions they will assume the sole responsibility for the continuance of the present unsatisfactory situation. With highest respect, A. S. CALVERT.

Please see the minute at P.Z. 6372/35 about the Saudi blockade of Koweit, and particularly the report flagged A of the discussion of this matter with the Sheikh of Koweit at the India Office during his visit to this country. This, of course, is one of the matters we are under an obligation to the Sheikh of Koweit to settle for hirn and a favourable opportunity presents itself in the forthcoming visit of Sir Andrew Ryan to Riyadh to be the personal guest of Ibn Saud. The present position is that the diplomatic correspondence at Jedda is more or less at a deadlock owing to the evasions of the Saudi Government, and the only hope of getting 4t settled is clearly by 4 personal -fcvvJJi ift\ Iwitv decision-by Ibn Saud. The telegram from the Resident dated 25th October stresses the importance from the point of view of our prestige in the Gulf, of getting the matter settled. The Foreign Office are proposing to instruct Sir Andrew Ryan to raise the matter with Ibn Said if he has time , the main discussions being on the frontier question and the subject of Slavery, on both of which substantial (t'WMM &lt;IkaaL fo ^ f 4*1 concessions are being offered by H.M.G. , iL draft d.o* A letter to the Foreign Office which explains itself is submitted. At this stage, and in view of the fact that for some time we have been dealing with the various Anglo-Saudi questions independently, it hardly seems practical politics to link the frontier question and the blockade question formally, as proposed by Colonel Fowle. But at any rate his telegram can be used as a lever to ensure, if possible, that the blockade question is putinto the front rank for discussion at Riyadh, and not relegated to the second rank# At the same time the Secretary of State may possibly wish to write a private letter to Sir Samuel Hoare in order to ensure that the matter receives the fullest consideration at the Foreign Office# A tentative draft for this purpose is also submitted. flS/X K 1 O* ft &amp;v-&gt;&lt;k+. • It is in regard to its emphasis that the F.O. draft despatch is defective, bat this is a matter of importance. I fear that on receipt of each instructions Sir A. Ryan would not feel able to deal with the matter effectively. Perhaps we might in the first instance try the d.o letter to Mr. Rendel. This may lead to consultation as to drafting, which may result in the F.O. adequately meeting our point of view. If it did not, the S. of S. might then perhaps be willing to send a private letter to Sir S.

This has now been done. 2. We are glad to note that it is proposed that Ryan should, if possible, raise the matter with Ibn Baud personally, but we are disturbed by the apparently secondary importance which the F.O. propose to attach to it. We feel that for the following reasons it is essential that the question should be made one of the primary issues to be discussed, and not one which should be tacked on to the Agenda should time permit. 3. In the first place it appears that the two main subjects for discussion, namely, the South Eastern frontier and Slavery, are those on which H.M.G. intend to offer substantial concessions to Ibn Saud. We suggest that it is only reasonable that v/hile these concessions are being offered Ibn Saud should be asked to meet H.M.G. in a matter v/hich ought to present him with no difficulties and which/which is one which he realises is regarded as of primary importance by namely, the Kuwait blockade. Even if Ryan is to be the guest of the King, there seems no reason why if there are to be business discussions, they should not cover business which is of primary importance to H.M.G. as well as tha^ which offers advantages to Ibn baud. 4. Secondly, we would emphasise the real importance, both on account of H.M.G.’s substantial stake in Kuwait and for the sake of their reputation for carrying out their promises (such as that made to the Sheikh m 1929) , n of the early liquidation of this long- j standing question. We would like this point elaborated in the instructions to Ryan (seei the suggestion made below). 5. Thirdly, it seems to us essential |o bear in mind the very definite impression which the Sheikh of Kuwait received during his visit to this country that H.M.G. would continue to use every possible endeavour to settle the matter of the blockade. In this connection it is only necessary to refer to ' c meeting at the 1.0. at which His Excellency definitely informed that H.M.G. would continue \ to do their utmost for Kuwait in this matte and to Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 12 o 1^935, of which a copy was sent to you on the 27th August under P.Z. 5766/35, and in which is given the Sheikh’s account of his audience of H.M. the King. the wasT Draft Paper. 0 »‘ i i C |N 6. Fourthly, Ibn Saab by his recent tactics in dealing with the question, as recited in para. 3 of your draft, appears to have placed himself on weak moral ground. He was ready to agree to the proposed method of controlling Saudi-Kuwait trade (i.e., the 'manifest” system, etc.) and the only reason for the breakdown in the negotiations has been the t insistence by the Saudi Govt, on a wholly unreasonable condition, namely, that the Sheikh should prevent any single smuggler crossing his frontier. During the diplomatic correspondence that H.M.G. have been carrying on through Jedda, the Saudi Govt, have been driven to evading the real point. It thus seems clear that the best prospect of getting the onreasonable condition withdrawn is by frankly discussing the matter personally with Ibn Saud. And the opportunity of such discussion seems to offer a fair prospect of success ov/ing to the weakness of Ibn Saud's ground resulting from his expressed, readiness to agree to the proposed settlement and his attachment thereto of a condition so obviously unreasonable that (though it may have been meant to be nullifying) it would be difficult for him to back out on such a ground. 7. We have been confirmed in our $ 3761 5000 5.,') 5 view/A jgr &gt; view by the receipt of a telegram from the Resident, of which I enclose a copy for yoofr information. As you will see, he stresses the very grave effects which a continued failure to settle the blockade question will have in the Gulf, and he suggests that t * * during the forthcoming discussions, any concessions which H.M.G. may be prepared to make in regard to the South-Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia should be made dependent on settlement of the blockade question. We should oursehes be disposed to favour the two questions being linked up, but in any case we feel strongly that Fowle’s telegrar^ makes it more than ever important for the blockade discussion to be put definitely in the front rank at Riyadh and not relegated to a secondary place. 8. We would accordingly suggest the following amendments to your draft despatch^ ' i!9!l ^ Substitute for the present para. 2:- 11 “Though it is to be expected that these topics will occupy a great part of the time available for political discussion at Riyadh, nevertheless I request that you will not fail at the same time to use every endeavour to secure an adequate settlement from King Abdul Aziz on the subject of his blockade of Kuwait. As you are aware, this blockade has now been maintained fop 1 more/Draft Paper. Department. I 4* A more than ten years, and as long ago as 1929 H.M.G. promised the Sheikh of Kuwait, in return for his co-operation which was loyally given in the interests of Ibn Baud during the Ikhwan rebellion, that they would do their best to secure an honourable settlement of the question. During his visit to London this year the Sheikh received assurances, to which he attaches the highest value, of the interest of H.M. and of H.M.G. in his affairs. I enclose copy of a telegram from the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf (No. 892 of 25th October, 1935) which emphasises how unfortunate would be the reactions in Kuwait and in the Persian Gulf generally of any failure to secure a settlement of the blockade question in the couse of the Anglo-Saudi negotiations now in progress. On account of the political and strategic importance of Kuwait (both actual and potential) H.M.G. are anxious to strengthen their friendly relations with its ruler.

I entirely share your view as to the desirability of strengthening and consolidating our relations with Ibn Saud by means of a friendly understanding and settlement of outstanding causes of friction and dispute, and also as to the expediency of managing him carefully daring the present crisis with Italy. But any settlement must be a matter of give and take. You are aware of the importance of our stake in Koweit, of the Sheikh’s long-standing grievance against Ibn Saud in regard to the blockade, and of the nromises which he has received from us. The enclosed copy of a telegram from Bushire (which has of course also been communicated officially to your Dept.) strongly reinforces my own feeling that the opportunity of Ryan’s visit to Riyadh ought to be taken to attempt to deal effectively with the blockade question. The other main items on the agenda for the visit are the frontiers/&lt; 7 frontiers of Saudi Arabia, on which we are prepared to make great concessions, and slavery, in regard to which we are also, I understand, to meet Ibn Saud's &lt; point of view. I saw the Sheikh of Koweit when he wa^ i t over here, and feel personally that it is a matter of first-class importance to do everything we can to help him over the blockade question. To this I am sure you will agree. From the 1.0. point of view we should be quite glad to have this matter how linked up with tto-othor mabtei^s on which we are offering concessions to Ibn Saud, but that, of course, is a point for you to decide finally. In any case, I feel that we ought to keep this subject in the t I forefront of Ryan*s forthcoming discussions at Riyadh and lay emphasis on the importance of it from the point of view of H.M.G.1935 J CWP/WB ( 111 groups 0 ) 5739 a 5739 0 .

THE PERSIAN GULF. ^^l^^ r0 % d ^ re i or n i ealir ‘i&gt; Vf 1 P r sian QuL f Q ves tiom .—For some time after 1922 the Colonial Office, besides administering Palestine, Transjordan, and the Iraq Mandate, had a general responsibility for political questions affecting Arabia including those arising on the side of the Persian Gulf. The Government of India remained responsible for internal questions in Koweit, Bahrein, the Truciai Sheikhdoms and Muscat, except that the Colonial Office dealt with oil questions in the Gulf generally. When Ibn Sand became King of the Hejaz, the conduct of relations with him passed to _ the Foreign Office, and when Iraq became an independent otate and the Foreign Office thus became also responsible for Anglo- Iraqi relations, the residue of the Colonial Office main interest in Persian Gulf politics disappeared, and that Department asked to be relieved of its responsibility ' he T re 5 nai ^ 1 i g ^ States - Tlle Cabinet then decided, on doth July 1933, that the India Office snould receive departmental responsibility for I ersian Gulf affairs, i.e. generahpolitical questions (as well as internal administrative 2P es ) a 1 ffectl 1 n g Koweit,_Bahrein, Qatar, the Truciai Sheikhdoms and Muscat* t ?• ° ^ 1Ca Resident in the Persian Gulf accordingly now corresponds with the India Office and the Government of India regarding all such questions. Several other Departments (e.g. the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry and the Admiralty) are also concerned m these matters, and interdepartmental co-ordination continues to be ensured through two Qub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence tone of permanent officials and one of Ministers). This system had been established some time previously, and has been found to work well. The differences between departmental views are most often adjusted in the Official Committee, and the few that cannot be thus resolved are submitted to the Ministerial Committee for decision. 2. British Relations with Persian Gulf States .—Muscat is an independent State m special treaty relations with this country, but also in treaty relationship with France and the United States of America. Koweit, Bahrein and Qatar are mdepenaent States m exclusive treaty relation with His Majesty’s Government and virtually under British protection, though they are not “protectorates.” The Truciai Sheikhdoms (Abu Dhabi, Debai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qawain and Has aJ Khaimah) are m a similar position, though we have not, generally speakino- entered into obligations to protect them by land. The general effect of our treaties with all tnese States and Statelets, and of the growth of practice, is that we control their external relations and that they agree not to admit foreign representatives (except m the case of Muscat) or to cede territory to foreign Powers or to grant on, and (except m the case of Muscat) certain other, concessions without our consent. o. I he Arab Shore Air Route. In 1931 the Persian Government declined to- r 1 en ?J r? 6 P ermit Imperial Airways to fly over Persian territorv, and it was decided to transfer the service to the Arab shore of the Gulf. For this purpose it was necessary to provide a night stopping place on the Truciai Coast After prolonged negotiations with many of the Truciai Sheikhs, conducted'by the qp 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 p R ® sade ^’ the late Sir H. Biscoe, an agreement was concluded with the ^ 61 m unde T ^hmh a resthouse for Imperial Airways passengers was provided at that place It had already been decided that the strategic route of the Poya An- Force should lie along the Arab shore. Facilities for the necessary refuelling depots and emergency landing grounds for this had to be obtained from difficulty SheikhS COnCerned ’ and this has occasionally been a matter of some 4. Oih--A nurnber of oil companies have in recent years taken an interest in the potentialities of the Arab shore of the Gulf. In 1925 the Eastern and General yndicate, a firm of concession-hunters, obtained an oil concession from the Sheikh Gn iwin; • C T° m ? any W ? S n0t Panted by the terms of the concession from translening it to foreign interests, and it was found necessary to allow them to 4087—4 35 9.352 transfer it to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California, though under conditions which adequately safeguard British political interests and on terms which are very advantageous to the Sheikh. Oil is actually being’ produced. In Koweit, pnoi to iJou, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania were competitors for a concession. ' As it is not a necessary part of British policy in the Pers.an Gulf (save on the Trucial Coast and in Qatar, which are specially backward) to exclude foreign traders and concessionaires, provided that our political interests are safe guarded the Sheikh of Koweit was not prevented from dealing with the Americans. The latter presently joined forces with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and formed the Koweit Oil Company, in which they are equally repiesentech An Agreement satisfactorily safeguarding onr interests was made between this company and His Majesty's Government in March 1934, and a concession was granted to tne Company by the Sheikh of Koweit in December 1934. Operations are still only at the exploratory stage. In Qatar, the Sheikh has recently granted a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, representing the Iraq Petroleum Company, the other partners in which (the Royal Dutch Shell and French and American groups; will have to be given the option of participating m the concession ; but the British element in the combination to wdrich the concession passes is bound to be substantial and may it is hoped, be predominant. In this case also, as m that of Koweit, an agreement was made between the Company and His Majesty s Government_ to safeguard our interests during the working of the concession. But t be admission of an oil company to work in Qatar aiso raised political questions of major importance-for example, that of the protection of the Sheikh s undefined landward frontier. The Sheikh has been promised protection (to be afforded by the hoyal Air Force) against serious and unprovoked incursions fiom outside his frontiei. Difficult negotiations on this and other political questions in connection with the o-rant of the concession were successfully carried through by Colonel lowie last May. The Sheikh’s son was recognised as his heir (though this does not involve a commitment to ensure his succession when the time comes), and the Sheikh agieecl to cede to the British authorities jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons other than subjects of Arab States in the Gulf. Interest in the Trucial Coast has been aroused by oil developments elsewhere in the Gulf. Recently the Anglo-Persian Oil Company visited Abu Dhabi, and the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah has now made a request for a visit by a geologist of that company. We have been approached by a^ concession-hunter, Major I. Holmes, regarding the possibility of a concession being granted to a British company m respect of Abu Dhabi and Debai. 5. Relations with Saudi Arabia.—In the summer of 1934 the Saudi Government put out feelers with a view to the establishment of closer relations with His Majesty’s Government and mutual co-ordination of policy. On 12th—14th July 1934 meetings took place between Sir A. Ryan and Ibn Sand, and later on con versations were held in London between Fuad Hamza, Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sir A. Ryan, and the Foreign Office. It was thought that, while there could be no question of an alliance with, or military commitment to, Ibn Sand, there would be advantage in a rapprochement or entente by which outstanding causes of dispute could be settled and the friendship between the two Poweis reaffirmed. Besides the future of the Hejaz Railway and the right of the British Legation at Jedda to manumit slaves, the questions outstanding between Ilis Majesty s Government and Ibn Sand included (a) permission for British aircraft to use the Hasa coast; (h) the treatment of goods transiting Bahrein for Ibn Sand’s territory; (c) Ibn Sand’s blockade of Koweit (see below); and (d) the eastern frontier of Ibn Sand’s dominions. It was arranged that Sir A. Ryan should enter on formal negotiations at Jedda last winter. The Bahrein transit question, however, was remitted to a conference at Bahrein of Saudi and Bahreini representatives, and an agreement w f as reached which will be ratified by the Saudi Government and His Majesty’s Government, subject to settlement of one minor point. It has now been decided that the outstanding questions can be handled separately and need not be combined in general negotiations. Sir A. Ryan’s negotiations have been mainly taken up with the question of Ibn Sand’s eastern frontier. Under Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 the old Ottoman dominions were bounded by a line (known as the Blue Line) drawn south from a point opposite the island of Zakhuniya (i.e. approximately along meridian 50° 18' east) to the 20th parallel,wheie it met tlie Violet Line bounding the British sphere of influence in south western Arabia. _ Ibn Sand lias taken the strongest exception to His Majesty’s Government s claim that as successor to the Ottoman Empire in this area he has mhented this fiontier. He claims that ins ancestors acquired rights of sovereignty to the east of it, in which they were independent of Turkey. It was decided that the whole question should be discussed in a generous spirit, and His Majesty’s Government are prepared to recognise Ibn Sand’s sovereignty over a certain area (lying principally in the interior) to the east of the Blue Line, where it would not conflict with the rights of our proteges on the Trucial Coast and our own strategic requirements. Discussions of the question, however, had not reached the stage of a definite settlement before Fuad Hamza and Sir A. Ryan recently left Jedda for London ; it is possible that they may be continued in London. Meanwhile, all that has been actually offered to the Saudis is a line running south from the Dohat es Salwa to the 20th parallel. G. Koweit .—There are certain difficult questions pending in regard to Koweit, 1 he position of this place at the tread of the Persian Gulf gives it great importance to His Majesty s Government, both m connection with Imperial air communications, civil and military, and also on account of the expiry of the Mandate in Iraq and the uncertainty of our future relations with that country. „ 0 • t/' . . , /ftMm w G baudi blockade o/_ Ao?re?t.—Ivoweit is the natural entrepot for the trade of north-east Arabia, and in view of this she maintains a low customs tariff, with ad valorem ^ duties of 4-4|- per cent. Since the war, however, her neighbours in Saudi Arabia and Iiaq have adopted high tariffs. Ibn Sand alleges a difficulty m collecting his duties on goods entering through Koweit. The Sheikh maintains that they should be collected at the Saudi frontier, but Ibn Sand has insisted on other arrangements^ (e.g. the establishment of a Nejd customs post in Koweit), to which the Sheikh objects as infringements of his sovereignty. For more than 10 years past Ibn Sand has imposed an almost complete embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd, and has endeavoured to prevent, usually with success, his tribesmen from buying their supplies in Koweit, their natural market. His real object in taking this drastic action is doubtless to increase the customs revenue of his Hasa ports, and quite piobably also the much more sinister intention of reducing Koweit to dependence upon himself. 1 his blockade has naturally had a disastrous effect on the piospenty of Koweit trade. In 1929, in return for the Sheikh’s co-operation against the Akhwan rebels in their revolt against Ibn Saud, His Majesty’s Government promised the Sheikh that they would do their best to secure for him an honourable settlement of the question. In 1931 the late Political Resident persuaded Ibn Saud to agree to a meeting of representatives of Koweit and Iraq, wdth the object of finding a solution. But the King subsequently withdrew his consent owing to a misunderstanding about certain Koweiti claims for compensation arising out of the Akhwan icbellion in 1929, which could have been used as a bargaining counter in the blockade negotiations, but wffiich Ibn Saud regarded as having been abandoned in a letter written to him direct by the Sheikh, though the latter denied this. Recently, however, in the course of his negotiations on Anglo-Saudi relations, Sir Andrew Ryan has succeeded in persuading Ibn Saud to agree again to the holding •of a Saudi-Koweit Conference on the blockade, the question of the Sheikh’s claims against Ibn Saud being^ tacitly ignored. The Saudi representatives have now’ (June 1935) arrived at Koweit and discussions are being held on the question of the Saudi blockade, but it is extremely doubtful whether practical settlement will result from these discussions. The Saudis, for their part, Lave in the past stated quite frankly that a settlement of the blockade question is not in their interests. 8. The Sheikh’s Date Gardens in Iraq .—In return for the Sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks during the war, His Majesty’s Government in 1914 recognised “ as a n independent' Sheikhdom under British protection, and also promised that the Sheikhs date gardens in Iraq would remain in the possession of the Sheikh, and^ of his successors, and be immune from taxation. In the view of His Majesty s Government the obligation of implementing this promise has now devolved on the Iraqi Government, but unfortunately the former failed, clurino- the currency of the Mandate, to obtain from the latter an undertaking to do so. °The Iraqis have now in fact imposed taxation on the produce of these gardens • in addition, on account of a purely technical flaw in the Sheikh’s title, actions have been brought against him m the Iraqi courts to dispossess him of laro- e portions of t. i-\4 them (called the Faddaghiyeh Estates), though it has hitherto been possible, except in one minor case, to prevent judgment being given against the Sheikh for the time beino- Lengthy and complicated negotiations have taken place with the Iraqi Government on this question, and more than one reference has been made to the Law Officers on its various aspects. His Majesty’s Government at length conceded to the Iraqis that the question should be solved on the basis^ that His Majesty’s. Government would compensate the Sheikh for the taxation of his date gardens, and pay the Iraqi Government a sum of £2,000 to buy off the claimants to the Sheikh’s Faddaghiyeh estates, in return for which the Iraqi Government would validate beyond all question the Sheikh’s title to the latter. _ In spite of this, however, and of the most categorical assurances received at various times fiom the Iraqis that the}' would settle this matter in the Sheikh’s favour, they have not yet done so, and discussions are still proceeding. The continued inability of His Majesty’s Govern ment to fulfil their pledge to the Sheikh has naturally had an unfortunate effect on our relations with the Sheikh. 9. Koweit-Iraq Smuggling.—The pearling trade on which Koweit used to depend is very depressed and she has no agricultuie or mdustiy of any importance. On account of the Saudi blockade she has been unable for several years to export much to Nejd, but a large quantity of goods are at present imported into Koweit with a view to being smuggled over the Iraqi frontier. Hie actual smuggling is, however, carried on principally by Iraqis, and the Iraqi Government have hitherto failed to impose an effective customs preventive service on the Koweit-Iraqi frontier. Instead of this, they have appealed to His Majesty’s Government to try and persuade the Sheikh to co-operate with them in suppressing the smuggling by imposing a quota for goods imported into Koweit. The Sheikh is under no legal obligation to prevent this smuggling trade, but Iraq is in a very strong position to bring pressure to bear. For example, Koweit is entirely dependent for its water supply on fresh water brought in boats from the Shatt-el-Arab in Iraq territory, and the Iraqis could also prevent the export to Koweit of the produce of the Sheikh’s date gardens in Iraq. There have in the past been several cases of incidents in which Koweiti subjects have been shot in Koweiti territory or territorial waters by Iraqi customs guards, but the Iraqis have always been able to deny the facts of these incidents, and it is quite impossible to prove them. In view of these factors His Majesty’s Government, while not agreeing to the imposition of a quota system on Koweit, have done their best to persuade the Sheikh to confer with the Iraqis with a view to reaching an agreement on the basis of the appointment of a British Director of Customs at Koweit with wide powers to enable him to co-operate with an Iraqi preventive service on the frontier. (Failing a solution by agreement, the Iraqi Government have threatened to impose a strict blockade on trade from Koweit.) The Sheikh, however, has hitherto declined this plan. The position seems to be that, whatever methods are employed to suppress the smuggling trade, Koweit will suffer severely, and the Sheikh prefers to chance the effectiveness of an Iraqi blockade rather than incur from his own subjects the odium of taking action himself which would undoubtedly have an adverse effect on what remains of their prosperity.

TKIBAL MK'VS All? uQQATl 1 .^, (a) The Kuwait tribes appear to have become unaccountably nervous and restless, during the period under review* This I put down to tiie rumours which have almost daily been filtering in from Ri&amp;th, to the effect that Bin Satid, still smarting under what he calls tie 'insulting 11 notes which he has received from His Majesty’s Government in the tatter of the 6 armed men incident, continues to rage and publicly vow vengeance against Kuwait in almost every 'Mijliss' he attends* He is reported as having even hinted that it might be necessary soon to punish the Shaikh of Kuwait, by some form of raid or other into Kuwait territory, (this latter must be accepted with caution)* (b) Unfortunately unwise ana publicly expressed opinions of this Kind have a way of reacting dangerously on excited admirers, as there is always the danger that a 'Thomas a Becket' incident may result* it is therefore doubly unfortunate that Bln Baud does not try and show some restraint of language, when discussing Kuwait affairs with his entourage in Riath* (c) Already some of the King’s remarks have fallen on ,ood soil, and both Hamud al Bagaawi, and A1 Khuderi, the Baud! frontier Officers in charges of Blockade arrangements at Jarriya al Ilya and Hafar al Batin, have of late been holding meetings of utair and Harb leaders, explaining to them that the Shaikh of Kuwait is in the very bad books of the great King, and that t he latter is looking about for means to/4 . to punish him* That they (the tribal leaders) are one and all to look upon Kuwait as an enemy country# and must entirely understand that Kuwait is absolutely forbidden to them, and that the King means business this time. In this connection see note on the Kuwait Blockade situation as existing at the end of July, in para.140(a)# (b), (a), (d) of uwait Intelligence Summary No.12. (d) It nor# appears certain that the large petrol ^dump^ which was recently located at Jerriya Ilya# aid which it was thought was for the use of American geologists# is a Blockade measure pure and simple# and i* intended for the use of the extra Blockade cars that have been brought up to the Kuwait frontier (Bee para. 141(e) of Kuwait Intelligence Summary Ho. 13?) COMMENT. (i) In the above connection it will be found interesting to peruse para.135(d) of Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.11# for the first half of July# also para.140 of Kuwait Summary Ho.12 for the second half of July. In the former it was pointed out that Bin Baud's 'third blte H at Kuwait waul t ake the form of his informing His Majesty's Government that he proposed enforcing a complete ban on all forms of inter-communication between Nejd ana Kuwait. In the second of these references it was clearly shown that by the end of July Bin Baud had in actual fact enforced this proposed Ban on people or trade coming from Kuwait without informing His Majesty's Government. (ii) The above facts are worth mentioning as from telegram 144, dated 37th August, and again from telegram 153, dated 2nd September from H.M's. Charge &amp;*Affaires# Jeada to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (received as this goes to press), the Saudi Government would appear to be taking the line that# as a result of a so called Increase of/of smuggling from Kuwait into Nejd since the breakdown of the Conference, it proposed 'to enforce a ban on trade of every description from Kuwait to Hejd and to altogether forbid Kuwait Nationals from entering bauai Arabia until such time as a proper understanding was arrived at with Kuwait' - when in actual reality this state of aiiaira was in existence by the end of July last as mentioned above ana reported in para*14o(b, of Kuwait Summary do.13# (ill) As regards Bin Baud's latest accusation re inc. ease or smuggling;Ufie only recorded case of smuggling ainct the breakdown of the Conference is that mentioned in ])ara#140 (e) of Kuwait Nummary Ho#12, when a small party of Nejd Mutair were caught smuggling rice at Jarrab in Qasia on 18th July. Vhe Saudi Oovernment ’ a X'ewxvks on the subject are therefore certainly not true, and are clearly intended as 'food n only for His Majesty* a u-ovarnmont# (iv) fhe Saudi Government 1 a statement (vide Jedda’s telegram 156, dated mud September 1955 quoted above) that they nave been obliged to move forces from Hail to the Kuwait frontier is xn the other hana correct: See para. 140(c) and (d) of Kuwait Summary IS for July), but this has been done purely to tighten up Vm, alreauy existing blockade, (see third bite), and is net a result of increased smuggling*Draft Paper.

In this connection we should like to suggest, if you have not got it already in mind, that this wvA(«r saigkt be a good opportunity for trying to get the troublesome question of the Saudi blockade of Koweit out of the way; that the Saudi delegation to the Koweit conference did not really explain to the King what the Sheikh was offering in the way of an honourable undertaking to prevent smuggling in the event of a settlement being reached, and that the very unreasonable attitude taken up by the delegation may not have been the sort of attitude that Ibn Saud himself would have taken if he had been in full possession of the facts. If indeed there was any misunderstanding, and if there is, in fact, a chance that Ibn Saud might' accept' an honourable undertaking backed by His Majesty’s Government/2 . Government, it clear that this would he the hest settling the i matter. Sir Andrew could, no doubt, alscj impress on the King^the podr publicity value of* a flat refusal to accept so reasonable a compromise as that offered by the Sheikh and pressed upon ^ by His Majesty* s Government.

Yusuf Yasin in conversations over Italian Ethiopian situation has been almost perfervid in assertions of Saudi friendship for His Majesty’s Government. On one occasion however he admitted they were obliged to maintain that friendship (I understood him to mean for geographical reasons) Little sign of such friendship appears to characterise Saudi attitude on certain questions notably Koweit and dispensaries. I would suggest therefore with some diffidence and subject to your approval that if opportunity presents itself before Yusuf Yasin leaves Jedda I declare as from myself that I have noted, welcomed and passed on to you his assertions Ox Saudi friendship but I am bound to confess that the lacK of accommodating spirit shown by them over above questions has been scarcely such as to confirm his protestations.Notes.

The Charge d’Affaires at Jedda addressed a note to the Saudi Government on 12th August (P.

As yet, however, the Saudis appear to have ignored this note. On the other hand they now allege that since the breakdown of the Conference at Kov/eit smuggling from Koweit into Saudi- Arabia has intensified, so that the Saudi Government find it necessary to take the 3330 1000 12.34 severest/severest measures to check it (Jedda telegrams 144 ana lo.3 flagged). In a note to the Legation the Saudi Government sta.te that they propose therefore to instruct their tribal leaders that all goods coming from Koweit shall he confiscated and that all individuals coming from Koweit without previous notification to the Saudi authorities shall he stopped until a satisfactory agreement is reached on the lines suggesued hy the Saudis at the Conference.

As regards blockade they are surprised to learn of alleged increase of smuggling from Koweit and of intention of Saudi Government to restrict intercourse v/ith Koweit still further. As Fuad Hamza was informed in London, His Majesty's Government consider that Saudi demand for guarantee from Koweit that no smuggler shall ever cross frontier is unreasonable,.and they regret to observe that no consideration has apparently been given to your note of August 12th. His Majesty's Government desire to draw attention of Saudi Government once again to importance they attach to settlement of this Question and to proposals in your note of 12th August. If Saudi Government insist on impossible conditions they will assume sole responsibility for continuance of present unsatis factory situation.

Mr. Ward is putting up a fairly stiff draft tciX tflA South saying that we regard the 'incursion' incident as closed and as irrelevant to the blockade issue, that H.M.G. are surprised to learn the present intentions of the Saudi Government, especially in view of the fact that the latter have made no reply to the Legation Note of 12th August which again urged upon the Saudi Government of the Sheikh's proposals which H.M.G. regard as entirely reasonable, and that so long as the Saudi Government demand impossible conditions from the Sheikh as a part of any settlement they alone will be responsible for the failure to reach agreement and for the continuance of the present unsatisfactoryposition It remains to be seen whether a draft on these lines finds general acceptance in the Foreign Office.In any further communication on this subject, please quote n °E and address —not to any person by name, hut to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

He asserted that dues were levied at the gates of Koweit itself on goods leaving the town which everyone knew were to be smuggled j-.e. smuggling received official countenance. 2.

Yusuf Yasin said (gr.omit.) I saw Saudi reply i snould gather that Ibn Saud subscribed to principle of free dom oi movement over frontier as was the age-long practice. Present restrictions were provisional* 5. He continued that he was authorized to discuss ques tion further with me by personal exchange of views. Speak ing personally he expressed opinion that Koweit was disin clined to prohibit smuggling into Saudi Arabia as she would c.lso find herself compelled to control her smuggling with Iraq, a traffic twice as extensive.

All the reports of the Conference at Koweit have now been received, but they do not add very much to the telegraphic summaries on which the previous minute was written. It seems clear that the Saudi delegates received specific instructions from Ibn Saud himself that they were to insist on a ’’guarantee” that if the blockade were to be removed and trade resumed on the basis of a system of customs posts and manifests the Sheikh would prevent smuggling across the border from his side. It is not very clear whether the delegates completely understood the King’s instructions. It is possible that in insisting 3330 1000 12.34 that no single smuggler should be allowed tocross the border they were going rather beyond what the King had really intended and that Ibn Saud, when he clearly understands that the Sheilch is prepared to give an undertaking on his word of honour to do everything possible to stop smuggling, and that H.M.G. are prepared to do their best to ensure the fulfilment of this honourable undertaking, may be disposed to come to terns. 3. The Foreign Office, after consultation with us, have sent off a telegram to Jedda instructing the Chargd d’Afiaires to press this matter on the Saudi Government. 4. When the Sheikh was at the India Office he mentioned this matter and was informed that H.M.G. rega.rded the demands of the Saudi delegates to the Koweit Conference as unreasonable, and were- still doing their best to secure a settlement of the WtoEfttcnita question with Ibn Saud. Fuad Hamza was also in London at the time, and the Foreign Office took the opportunity of pressing the matter on him.

BIN SAUD’S BLOCKADE. (a) This was once again definitely tightened up after the departure of the Saudian Wafd, hut probably was due not so much so much to the breakdown of the Conference, at Kuwait,/ as to the annoyance felt by Bin Saud at His Majesty*s Government’s protest in the matter of the violation of the Kuwait frontier on 6 th May. (See paragraph 125(c) of Summary No.11). (b) The situation at the end of July 1935 therefore is that: (a) No trade whatsoever is allowed between Kuwait and Nejd; (b) Every single article going from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia however small is ipso facto declared contraband; (c) No Nejdi, townsmen or tribesmen (including women)can visit Kuwait without first obtaining a permit from Bin Saud or one of his Governors; (d) No Kuwaiti may visit Nejd unless he can show that he is going to see a relative there or is taking a present to the King. Anyone with a gift for Bin Saud is always allowed to pass# There is actually nothing new in the above situation, things have only been tightened up. Conditions being as they are it is not quite understood why H.E. Pud Hamza in London objected to the term 'Blockade of Kuwait', for a more complete blockade than that existing already would be hard to find# (c) A second line of Blockade posts is now reported to have been established at the wells of Jarab - Artawiyeh and Hafar al Atz in the Dahana region. These are in addition to the posts at Al Maqtaa - Jarriya Ilya - Safa - and Hafar al Batin, which we may call the first line# The 1st line (less Hafar al Batin) is under Hamid al Bagaawi. The 2 nd line is under our old friend Ibn Arfaj. Note. The post at Hafar al Batin is found from Hail and is under the command of 'al Khuderi'# (d) Apart from the above, motor car patrols now regularly visit the various 'Dahals' of the Summan region (Mutair/(Mutair country). These 'dahals' number 18 and consist of natural underground caverns leading off into subterranean cisterns, all of which have water of sorts in them* They are quite useless for watering camel herds, or floostks of sheep, because of the difficulty of getting the water to the surface (a man has to crawl many feet underground to the various cisterns with his goat skin to get one 'fill”) but are eminently suitable places for small parties to draw drinking water from, if they are anxious to avoid the main wells mentioned above and the posts camped thereon* The names of the 'Bahais” ar^feiven below for interest’s sake* A1 Raggas, A1 Thaiyit, Ab al Bhaiyan, A1 Jarabi, Um al Qrun, Al Khaliya, Al Azaiyir, Um Warcham, Um Jamd, Bith al Ashafi, Al Shamshul, Al A 3 a3, Abu Sukhaim, Al Paraih, Abu Tutaha, Ash Shami, Al Muttar, Abu Harmala* (e) A Mutair party with a few bags of rice ex Kuwait, is reported to have been tracked down and attacked by a Saudian patrol at Jarab on 18th July (where Captain Shakespear was killed), the patrol however was beaten off with the loss of 4 men* The smugglers got through to Qasim.I' Cr ( 3 ) S audi Blockade of Kowei t._ THE SHEIKH said that in IS29 he had received a letter from H.M.G. concerning his trade with Eejd, promising that if His Excellency would prevent help being given to Faisal al Duwish, H.M.G. would endeavour to reach a solution of his trade difficulties with King Abdul Aziz. His Excellency had carried out his part and had even fought with Al Duwish’s people, but H.M.G. , for their part, had as yet failed to make any progress towards a solution of the blockade. A Saudi deputation of 83 persons hah recently visited Koweit, but His Excellency thought that no good had come of the conference which had taken place. MR.LAITHWAJTE said that for some time H.M.G. had been trying hard to reach a solution of the Dlocxade question with King Abdul Aziz, and that, as the Sheikn would remember the proposal for a conference re 0 axd-..*. 0 i , which had now materialised, had originated with the late Sir Hugh Eiscoe. He reminded the Sheikh that matters had been held up for more than a year owing to a misunderstanding about certain correspondence between His Excellency and the King of Saudi Arabia. after briefly recalling the proceedings at the recent Conference at Koweit, he said that H.M.G. regarded it as satisfactory that the Saudi delegation had gone so far as agreeing even on the principle of a system of manifests and Customs posts. H.M.G. entirely agreed that Hie Saadi demand for a guarantee as a condition of agreement on this basis, that not a single Koweit smuggler would cross the frontier was quite unreasonable. The India Oflice and Foreign/Foreign Office had already made strong representations to Fuad Bey Hamza regarding this guarantee in which they had emphasised that Koweit was however prepared to give an honourable undertaking to do all in its power to suppress smuggling. They would continue to do their utmost for Koweit in the matter. MR. REHDBL said that only that morning he had again spoken to Fuad Bey Hamza and that Fuad Bey had telegraphed on the subject to King Abdul Aziz. His Excellency expressed thanks to H.M.G. for the action which they had taken.II VTl u 1L _ }'^i 1 1 J y ^ 1 ^ _ J: 37* 24. SAUm I'iuij..GA’-.'10ii FOB BLOCKADE COI-JgJiJiiatCS .

It was a oas«» of could they agree to the 'guar ntee' now and at the elerventh hour or not. If not they, the Saudi Delegates, had their orders to end the dlwusslona and go hone.

O From Political, Km ait. To Political Rasideat, Rushire. L o • Q— i 90 • Dated 18th Jvtm 193 § In continuation of my telegram Mo. 184 dated the 16th June 1935, X beg to report that the Saudi delegation conaislng of (a) Khalid ibn al v^alid. (b) Hamad al sulaiman. (o) Abdulla al Quasibl. arrived at Kuwait in the early morning of 16th June from Hoffuf. E. The party came in m&amp;vm lorries and six touring cars and were accompanied by 70 attendants (including drivers, servants and guards) • 3. The delegates r sported that they lost their way the End day out of Hoffuf, and narrowly escaped disaster and death from thirst owing to not being able to find water, which they had counted on. They also ran short of petrol when they at last reached Jarriya Ilya, and two single lorries had to go ahead and bring back petrol from Kin?ait to enable the main body to come on. That made them a whole E4 hours late in Kuwait.- 2 — 4 # The losing of their way the ridiculous decision to send lorries with the party, reflect© very badly on the Saudi Oovernraent 1 s 'bundobast* 1 , for lorries are the worst possible means of motor conveyance, once sunnier 3ms set in and drift sand has to be negotiated in the desert. One can only say that we in Kuwait would have put up a much better show, find the positions been reversed* 5* On arrival in Kuwait the delegates were given refreshment a and made comfortable, after which they called cm His Excellency the Shai&amp;h, and Khalid ibn al Walid presented a personal letter from H.M. King Abdul Aziz. 6, After leaving the Shaikh’s presence they called on me, and similarly handed to me a short personal letter from the King, which expressed the hope that the efforts of the delegates would be crowned with success and trusting that I would give them my full support. 7. Khalid Ibn al Walid appeared to be the leader of the party, and directed the conversations, as if he had been instructed beforehand to adopt that role. In appearance be resembled a thick set German, being very fair with a small blond beard. He described himself to me as a Tripoli tan, and said that he had served a period of five years detention in Home for his desert activities against Italy, and that for His going to the He jaz end subeequently to Bin Sand’ a Court later rebellion in the hinterland of Tripoli, had narrowly escaped being sent to Italy once again when he finally had to take refuge in Hgypt. It was iiaghlul Pasha who had sawed him— 3 ( 3*° } He Yolkintaored the iaforBiatioii that he spoke trench and Italian fluently, and said that he had hea:i brought up in Turkey and knew my grahdfather there. 8. Heither Hamdd al aulaiman nor Abdulla al qusaibi impressed me much, but one m tHared that they both had quite a large store of Hejdi rudeness and obstinacy in their matze up. 9. On the whole the composition of the party struclc me fairly favourably, though the 'Sffendi' characteristics of their leader and his frequest use of french words, during the subsequent discussions with the more untutored Kuwait delegates, savoured of a studied desire to show his superiority and to puironlzo t#hox&amp; Xi wus rosontjod 8.ooox*dingly. 10. The first discussion took place at 8 A.M. on 17th June, Kuwait being represented by the following delegates *The latter re placed Jasim al Budai, who died suddenly the day the delegates arrived* (a) Ahmad al Hamaithi. (b) Mohamed ibn Thunaiyan. ^(e) Khalid al 2aid al Khalid. I adopted the rale of looker on or 'nathlr* on behalf of H.M. Gov era men t. 11.

(a) Proceedings lasted from S A # M* to 9.30 A*K# and were opened by a brief speech by the Political Agent wishing both parties success in their* deliberation and asking Ood to bless their efforts* (b) IThalid ibn at /alia than opaaud the call on behalf of the Bau&amp;l Ck&gt;v orin^nt by a long winded and somewhat offensive speech, in which h© said that the King had instructed him to say that ho bad no personal enmity for Kuwait; that he had sent him and his friends to see whether a 'modus vivea&amp;i' could be ecme to, over the Blockade question: That they, the gaudi delegates, would listen to anything reasonable the Kuwaitis had to say, but frcm the first lie must warn than that ^Business was business, that sentiment would not be allowed to play any part in the proceedings 1 *: That he could tell %hm from the beginning, that Bin Baud, his master would agree to no settlement unless he bene fited equally with Kuwait: That the Saudi Government was a poor one and had to fi^it all the time to find means of getting revenue, so that no proposals of the Kuwait delegates would be acceptable or even be oon sidered unless they could show, some sort of finan cial advantage to Kaudi Arabia. That the King had blockaded Kuwait,with the delibe rate intention of diverting trade to his own ports - That he had succeeded in this,and had now got that treae and that therefore,if it pleased him to allow Kuwait to get'a little bit' of it back,it must be on 'terms”; That the-z~ That the Saudi Government did not. In any way, want to raise the blockade and give anything back to Kuwait, but out of friendship for the British Government, the King was willing to discuss matters always provided that Kuwait would make a rt worth while” offer. That first and foremost therefore and before an£ discussions or brguiaents could be listened to, the Kuwait delegates must state In the form of a letter to him, exactly what they were prepared tc concede by Wfy of advantage to Bin Baud, and exactly what their proposals were; This would be telegraphed to the King,and his orders taken. But the terns must be w ccneret 0 % and of an entirely positive” nature. *He had used the French equivalents for concrete and positive. (o) bin Sulaiiaan followed by half a dozen words in which he rudely reminded the Kuwait delegates that Kuwait was in the position of a person in prison, who was anxious to get out: They jailor was a man open to reason, and awaited an offer from the prisoner - If this was good he would open the prison gates. Mote b y the writer . To my mind speeches (b) and (e) shove were gratuitously insulting, and the Kuwait delegates, I could see, were deeply hurt. I had to intervene tactfully to prevent hot replies. (d) Abdulla al Ousaibl passed no remarks. (e) Khalid al Zaid al KhalM on behalf of the Kuwait delegates then replied briefly, to the effect that he was sorry that the Saudi delegates had chosen to adopt the role of n parliaentaires” so to speak from a victorious besieging force to a beleaguered city. That at one moment they had said that their King was out to heal the wounds of the past, and bore no ill mkwill to Kuwait, and then at the next, they (the delegates) talked about Kuwait being in the position of a prisoner, who if he only would offer a high enough bribe, would be allowed out* Th^Kuwait, seeing that she was the aggrieved party, had really little to offer* AH she wanted was an honest outlet for har trade with ^asim and ‘die Interior, and wished to do business in honest and straightforward manner. | That since the Chief spokesman of the Saudi Government had invited them to say what Kuwait was prepared to offer - his reply was Government (i) To pay full Sau&amp;i/Customs on all merchandise going from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia* | (li) To pay such duty at one or more Customs Posts which should be established on the Saudi side of the frontier. (ill) To allow no caravans from Kejd towns to leave Kuwait without proper manifests taken in triplicate - one to be given to the leader of * the caravan, the other sent to the Caudi Govern ment through Al Haflsi and the third to remain with the Kuwait Government* 1 (iv} NeJ&amp; Bedouin to be allowed to make minor purchases for their own every day needs free of interference, but ^iould they desire to take goods out of Kuwait above a certain quantity (this to be fixed after discussion) then they should likewise be given manifestos. Mote* Bo mention was made at this stage of the shaikh of Kuwait’s second alternative proposal viz. that he should act as Bin Baud’s Customs officer. (f) The Saudi delegates asked ttat the above proposal be adven1 given in writing the same evening, if possible, and they would telegraph it to the King* (g) The Kuwait delegates agreed,subject to the 3haikh f s approval. (h) I here remarked that, speaking quite unofficially, I thought that the Kuwait terms appeared reasonable,and that from my personal knowledge of the hinterland, the placing of one Customs Post at f Safa f or four posts at the wells of Kafar, Safa, darriya and Nta,would effec tually cloi?e any gaps, and be a complete success* To this the leader of the Saudi Delegation smilingly replied that he knew nothing at all of the terrain of the Kuwait frontier, but that he definitely could say that the idea of Customs Posts would certainly not meet with the King’s approval, seeing that hey would be costly, nevertheless if the Kuwait delegates put the proposal in writing, he would refer it to His Majesty* I pointed out that Bln Sand was already spending money on frontier preventive farce of 30 men, these would still be necessary under the Customs Posts and Manifest System. All that would be required extra, would be four to six Customs clerks, to take over the Customs duty when paid* (i) The Kuwait delegates then tried to Initiate an open dis cussion as to the merits of the Manifest System and to explain details of how it would work etc. But the leader of the Saudi Delegation refused to talk or discuss the matter at all. He said that until he referred Kuwaiti suggestion to the King discussion was a pure waste of time* He then got up with his friends and left the meeting. The day’s proceedings then ended. (j) Before adjourning the leader of the Baud! delegation made the cool request that I should take over and pay for all their telegrams to Hiath* I declined politely* I agreed however to wire the Director General Posts and Telegraphs,Baghdad and ask if IBAq, and the Saudi Govt, had come to any arrangement on the question of telegrams going free from Kuwait to the King regarding the Conference* NoteNote by the writer * li) The iapressioHBleft on me at the close of the first day’s proceedings were the reverse of favourshie. The whole tone of the &amp;&amp;udl delegates was too haughty and uncompromising* The spirit of good will was conspicuous by its absence. (li) The superior airs of the iSaudi delegates’ leader (almost invariably adopted 9 1 regret to say t by Saudi officials) created a bad Impression and hazarding a guess y I should say, was delibera-cely done to irritate. (ill) The head of the delegation made it dear that he believed the King would reject the Customs Posts and Manifest System on the lam a arouse that it would cost too much money. (iv) The continual hints of 'make it worth our while financially and we will ^n£e business', savoured far too much of 'give us a good subsidy, and we will open the Kuwait frontier 1 ** Perhaps this is what the Saudi dele gation is working up for* If so,it is the seme proposal that Bin Baud put forward several years ago, and which was rejected* (v) The Baud! delegation would appear to possess no authority to do anything on their own, and it looks as if they will refer everything to the King* AffTijHNOON OF ?raaT DAY (17 th Jus#} . (i) I received a telegram from the Director General Posts and Telegraphs Baghdad, that the Baud! delegates could send telegrams to do with Conference free* I duly informed the® to this effect. (ii) The Kuwait delegates with the shaikh’s approval addressed a very friendly and polite letter to the Baud! delegates (copyj^seen by me) in which after recalling all the past friendly relations between the house of Baud and *' the house of the Sabah, stated that Kw/ait 1 s sole desire was to-6 was to lire at peace with the present 3audi Qovernaent, and to trade honestly with her, and that she proposed posts and Manifest system (detailed in para (e) (i) (ii) (iii) above, as the only possible way out of the difficulty - Minor diffi culties could be considered on their merits, a 33 d reserved for further discussion, (iii) The Saudi delegates at once telegraphed to the King for orders* SECOND BAY (TO-DAY 18 th TOM I) . The Kuwait delegates and I attended at the Shaikh’s town office at 8 a,m* to continue discussions. This had been arranged between us prior to the break up of the meeting of the previous day. The Saudi delegates however did not turn up, but sent a message to sey that as they bad nothing to discuss pending receipt of the King* s reply to dieir telegram, they did not propose attending the meeting. This rudeness was rather typical and shocked the As polite Kuwait* not a little. 1 incidentally was told that the Shaikh’s daily menu for the Saudi delegates and party was six. sheep a day and two bags of rice. This apart from a host of good things such as fruits and sweetmeats (An easy Bs* 150/- a day). DAY (WEDHlSmy 19th JM ij. (i) I was ready at 8 A,M* as u&amp;jal to attend the Conference, but received early notice from the Shaikh’s Secretary, that the Saudi Delegation had sent word that they could discuss nothing and at tend no further meetings pending orders from the King. (ii) In the evening X saw the Shaikh while playing tennis - He smilingly asked what I thought cf the Saudi (delegation) and their methods at the flrest meeting.-7- (iii) I raplied cautiously that I hoped still that all would he right. (if) Ha laughingly continued 'How you have seen them and the big talk they use, perhape you and your Government will now see that sometimes Sheikh Ahmad, their small iriend and ally is right. I have already prophesied and told you many times that Bin Saud means to do absolutely nothing, and that he has merely sent his deletion after navlng prao tic ally received orders to do so from Kis Majesty's Government. Having gone so far he will do no more, but will now work for a good excuse or 'hujja' to bring about a failure of the conferaace. Believe me nothing we offer will be acceptable, except the payment of an enormous subsidy, or the surrender of Kuwait.' (v) She Ahuikh then wait on to say that certain 'stragglers' had now come In from Jarriya, and that the numbers of the iiaudi delegation had reached a total of 83 persons - She feeding of those was a difficult business and cost money, but aa it apparently pleased His Majesty's Government that the delegates were in Kuwait, he was not going to complain. He wondered (said laughingly) whether it would ever strike His Majesty's Government to reimburse Him for these eater taiiaiaen-t expenses, ©pined would not fall far short of Bs* 10,000/-. ^vi) l f or iay own see Eiy telegram - ; o. 197 of EOth June 1935.

SIXTH DAT (SATURDAY 22nd JUNJ) * (1) Delegates of both sides met at 8 A.H. on Saturday in Shaikh’s Mejliss room as usual, and meeting lasted froa 8 till 9 A.B. (see my tele^am Ho*200 of 21st June)* I was of course present. ( 2 ) Before business actually started Chief Saudi delegate asked if I had had any news by Radio of world affairs and I told him of the Naval Agreement with Gem any and Amir Sand’s doings in London as well as further details of the Auetta earthquake. (3) Business opened by the Chief Bau&amp;i delegate saying that a reply had been received from H.M. the King, to effect that rKnmit delegates should be asked whether in event of Customs Posts and Manifest^ System being introduced (a) The Kuwait Government would give a written document to the Saudi Government, guaranteeing teat all smuggling from Kuwaitfrom Kuwait to Hejd would cease forthwith, (h) That if Kuwait Governmeat would sot do this whether H.M.G. would be willing to give necessary written guarantee, (c) That it was immaterial who gave guarantee, B.M.G. or Kuwait, but guarantee must be given to King. He as senior Saudi delegate therefore puts above questions to both Kuwait delegates and to me, as representing H.M.G. (See my telegram Ho. BOS of SSnd June to Bushire) • ( 4 ) Before giving reply, the Kuwait delegates asked what was meant by ^Kuwait guaranteeing that there should be no further smuggling across the frontier once the manifest system was star ted ?T . To this Khalit! ibn al falid answered, that he thought that he had put his question plainly, but to make things quite clear, the following was what was meant:- * Kuwait must undertake in return for any such concession as the Customs Posts &amp; Manifest System, literally to allow no contraband trade whatsoever to go across the border into Saudi territory, and not even a single, Mir, must get through (his words), else the -ing would consider himself justified in denouncing any agreement arrived at*. Ara When asked how it was proposed that Kuwait should carry out such unreasonable guarantee, the reply came quick 'Tlmt i s your concern not ours n • A Kuwait delegate then asked whether Kuwait • would be held responsible, if say a Hejdi was Hejef caught running contraband from in 1BAQ, into Saudi Arabia by Saudi frontier police, and the origin of goods was sajd to be Kuwait, by the smuggler in an endeavour to cover his tracks, Therejjjy10 - The reply was ^Kuwait will be held responsible, for it will be up to her to stop all good going even over the IB&amp;&lt;i border, if such goods eventually find their way into Saudi Arabia, and it can be proved that the origin was Kuwait*. another Kuwait delegate asked whether it was proposed to invite XKAq and ^rans Jordan to give 4 guarantee that no smuggling went across the border - but no reply was given. (5) After some further discussion amongst themselves the Kuweit delegates replied that as Kuwait would find it quite inpoosible to carry out the under taking required of them and as they felt that the demand was entirely unreasonable, they must rejest same and give a ne^tive answer. At the game time they said that the undertaking they could and would give if the King would agree to it was * , £he Kuwait Government promises to do its honest best to put a stop to all smuggling into Ilejd, and gives its word of honour to this effect' ( 6 ) The Senior Saudi delegate then asked max, if H.M. G. would give the necessary guarantee . To this I replied with a Ho! pointing out that the question was one between Kuwait end Saudlyeh and did not directly concern H.M.Government. (7) The Senior Saudi B legate then said he would refer Kuwait # s reply, which was tak&amp;a down in writing, to the King, and the meeting adjourned. ( 8 ) Before the delegates actually left the room, the second Saudi d legate, Hamad bin Sulaiman,*let the eat out of the bag' somewhat by remarking in grumbling tone that for his part he saw nopoint at all in th% Customs Posts and 'Manifest System', that it ms waste of time to talk further * y#ben asked why he said this, he replied that he for one would never trust the Kuwait Customs authorities, and he saw no reason why a manifest should he given for 100 bags of sugar say to go to Nejd, when in reality 200 hags went out with the same caravan* (The odd 100 being earmarked as contraband to be run, as soon as caravan was near the border). The Kuwait delegates replied hotly that theirs further talks would be quite useless, if distrust of this sort was going to govern the minds of the Saudi Delegates: 1 managed to make peace, but the Saudi delegate was certainly asking for trouble. After the meeting had adjourned, I called on the Shaikh to discuss Political Resident’s telegram Ho. 540 of 21st June 1955 in which 1 was asked to try and persuade Shaikh to extend time of ofhe conference, even£himseIf was determined to leave for London on 24th June. The Shaikh listened to.me carefully and asked me to give reply to the Political Resident that he personally had quite definitely come to the eonolusion as a result of the first meeting only of his Delegates with those of Bin Baud, that 'no business' was meant, and that Bin Baud, who had obviously been ordered to send delegates to Kuwait, had from the first decided to make a failure of the Conference. This was as clearas daylight. That he (Shaikh) fully realised (with the Political Resident) that Bin Sand’s next move would probably be to try and fasten the blame on him (Ahmad) for a break down of discussions. In order to forestall possibility of this, he had taken the following action on Friday 22 nd June (although of course his coming departure was already knowa to Saudi delegates and to Bin uaud) * (a) He had called officially on Saudi delegates and explained that he had to leave for London on Monday 24th June in accordance with a programme arranged 3 months ago - That his departure need not affect Conference in least, as Shaikh Abdulla as Salim, his cousin would take over the reins of Government, and they,the delegates,could look upon him as they as they looked upon himself, viz as shaikh of Kuwait. That they were guests of Kuwait, and must not hesitate to stay as long they thought fit in Kuwait for the purpose of carrying the discussions to their logical and he hoped successful conclusion. (b) He seat a telegram on the sane lines as (a) above, to Bin Baud, trusting that Saudi Delegates would continue their labours after his departure under the aegis of Shaikh Abdulla. (Bee my telegram Mo. 204 of 22nd June to Bush ire) . Mote. The same evening at a banquet givsst by the Shaikh in honour of the Saudi Delegates (at which all the heads of the State were present), the Shaikh agpin expressed the hope that the delegates would continue their labours after his departure, and then read out the King’s reply telegren, which had in the meantime arrived. This was very graciously worded, and wished his brother Ahmad «God speed and an early return in completely restored health*. (o) The Bhaikh then mentioned in confidence that al Hafisi (Bin Baud’s Trade Agent) had confided to him that the Saudi delegates were greatly dis turbed, because X attended the discussions. They thought proceedings should be held as at Bahrain, with no British Government official to spy on tbs delibera tions. The Sheikh added, how grateful he was that had insisted on ay being jresent, as only through me oould the offensive behaviour and unreasonable suggestionsmrn —IS— suaaestIons of the Saudi delegitea, be properly,^ oonvaye cl to Busbire and London.

'Again and again I haw told you p other British Politioal Officers in the Gulf, of the behayiour of Saudi Government officials i^en 1to®y visit Kuwait, but I have never been believed yet, because I was supposed like Shaikh aalim, ray uncle, to be unreason able and prejudiced - Perhaps I shall be believed now** sWKHm DkY (6HKPkT 25rd 2Xml* Ho meeting* RTamn b&amp;y (mqhb4y 24 th rami * (1) fh© Saudi and Kuwait delegates met st 8 A*M. and once again for two hours discussed the nature and meaning fvom all angles of the * guar an tee* which Bin Baud required from the Kuwait Government, as a condition to his agreeing to the Customs Posts and Manifest System* ( s ee my telegram Ho. Ell of 25.6.35 (2) The Senior Saudi Delegate explained at length that, when he had said at 1&amp;e last meeting that Bin Baud was willing to agree to the 'Customs Post© and * Manifest By©tern' being introduced, on condition that the Kuwait Governaent guaranteed by written doeumeat that smuggling into Saudi Arabia will forthwith cease, he had meant by that, th&amp;t men if a single smuggler from Kuwait was caught by the Saudi frontier guards, the Shaikh of Kuwait would have broken his agreement and it would be open to the King to cancel any trade agreement arrived at at once if he chose* (3) When pressed by the Kuwait Delegates to aay wh&amp;t would actually happen in practice under the scheme as visualized by him (the Senior Saudi Delegate), the latter replied that in his opinion, if for instance, one snuggler from Kuwait was caught on the frontier his camel and goods would be confis^te the first-X4r. the fir at time , and a bill for the Customs recover able would be sent to the shaikh of Kumit, who wouK be expected to pay. The same thing would happen up to a limit of three times . After that the King would have the clear right, and would exercise afctefc such ri^it, to cancel the whole Trade Agreement on the ground that Kuwait had failed in her guarantee (4) The Kuwait delegates argued very vigorously that such one sided conditions were not only unfair in the extreme # but left any agreement arrived at entirely at the mercy of the King, who could kill or keep it alive as he chose, seeing that all the world knew that the smu^ling fraternity existed even in the most well ordered and modern States. In other words they said that a grade which ms to be developed, opened up and financed by Hejd and Kuwait merchants Jointly, and could fall to the ground any moma&amp;t because forsooth 3 rascally smugglers rai^it happen to get caught within a period of perhaps a week, a month or six months, was useless to them; Quifre clearly therefore they could give no guarantee under such conditions. (5) The Saudi delegates said they quite saw their point, but Kuwait delegates must also theirs. The King Y had given thm their orders, clearly, unequivocally. These were that they (his delegates) must make it clear that the basic principle of any trade agree** ment that was to be negotiated was to be this 'guarantee' or 'tbaman'. If the Kuwait delegates chose to give the guarantee, then talks could be continued, if not then they had nothing further to do but go home* (6) {15- (6) I here myself interfered and said I thought it would be a thousand pities if for the sake of this one word *tb&amp;maa* or 'guarantee% the negotiations were to break down, and X urged the Saudi delegates to make things a little easier, for tie Kuwait delegates clearly could not give a 'dear out promise* to prevent any single smuggler from crossing the border, when next day they would be proved liars* I pointed out that supposing England and France s were trying to come to a trade agrees eat, advantageoi to the traders of both countries, what possible shsx chance would the agreement have of going through,if France for instance insisted on a clause giving them the power to cancel the a^eesaeat without not ice,if on© English smaller was caught within the territo rial waters of France. The Saudi delegates saw my point, but said I must not apply European standards to Kuwait and Kejd. (?) Hot to be out done and seeing that we were nearing in Impasse, X asked if smuggling went on between Bahrain and Qatar and Hassa - they admitted that a certain amount did - 'well* I said, 'do you not think in fairness that you ought to ask the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar, to give a'guarantee* that no smugglers would operate from these countries into Hejd*. The reply was that circumstances altered cases* (8) The Kuwait delegates once again stated that if the King would only drop the 'guarantee* or 'thaman* condition, they for their part would readily give a written document on behalf of Kuwait 'premising on the honour of the Bhaikh, the merchants and people of Kuwait to do their best, end by every meansri -xe- 1$9 , mean© in their power to reduce smuggling to a mini!mna M This the Saudi dalettes refused to consider, or even telegraph to the King, It ms ease of 'themes! w or nothing now, (9) Seeing that things were ag in getting^the danger point, I adjourned the meeting layself, under ths excuse that no doubt tee delegates all desired to bid farewell to the Shaikh who was about to leave for London by air, (10) It was only too evident to me that the Saudi delegates had received new instructions from the King, not to budge an inch from the 'guarantee' idea, and that they knew full well that the Kuwait delegates could not accept such conditions, and were out to force an issue on this point. Probably the next day or two will therefore see the break down of discussions. LATKR . (a) An hour after the adjournment of the meeting described above, the Saudi delegates addressed a letter dated 24th June 1933 to the Kuwait delegates, translation attached {and marked B), which was dearly meant to define their position. The Kuwait delegates at once replied by a similar letter dated 25th June 1935 recapitulating everything that the Saudi Senior Delegate had told them, giving their stand point, and asking for a final reply. A translation of this letter is attached (and marked C). Note. Both these letters are important documents in my opinion, as they prove that the Baudi delegates must bear the responsibility for the break down of negotiations now unfortunately eminent.17 , (b&gt; I «.!«.« to »««» .to.., .»«. aorw tb, debate of the morn lug, X enquired from the Senior Saudi delegate as to whether from reports and statistics at his disposal, he thought much smuggling went across the frontier into Saudi Arabia from Kuwait today * The answer was M Very little ( indeed, perhaps one smuggler is caught per month”. I next suggested that this desirable state of affairs was no doubt due to the splendid control maintained on the frontier by the King # s preventive guards and their Ocaoamander A1 Bagaawi - 'That was so' - came the reply* X then suggested, (emphasising that X put the question purely out of a desire to help in removing obstacles to an agreement) that as Saudi frontier control was so good today and as to existing frontier guards would certainly remain on even if the 'Customs rosts and Manifest System' were introduced, whether he and his brother delegates could not see their way to waive the 'guarantee clause', seeing that it was for all practical purposes quite necessary. The Senior dole gat© said he saw my point, but could not budge from the standpoint already taken up by him - (In an private aside to me he said he could not go against the King’s orders in this matter, for they were very explicit). Mote * From the above, two things appear quite clear:- (a) The delegates are acting under the King's direct orders and have no power to do anything on their own responsibility. (b) Mr* Phil by's statement made to me when he was here recently that snuggling into Kejd was still very heavy, was not admitted by the Saudi delegates to the Kuwait Conference and so cannot be relied on. Moreover it should not be forgotten that the two Senior Saudi delegates pose as experts, whose sole job in life is to deal wijh Tariffs, and frontier Customs questions convention with baud! Arabia* (see D.O.letter ho. 106/o d/-13*4.35 in connection with Philby'd recent visit to Kuwait).HIMTH DA.Y (TUESDAY 25th JUHB) (1) After receipt by the Saudi Delegates of the Kuwait $ ♦Marked 'G' Delegates* letter of 25th June, see under heading 'IATER (a) on page 16 of these notes*, the former at once held a private meeting and sent another ^Marked 'D* letter dated 25th June,translation attached, to the Kuwait Delegation. This letter speaks for itself, though its general purport is that 'You the Kuwait Delegates have not given us a final answer, you must definitely say whether you agree to give the •guarantee* or reject same*. (2) Replying on the same day (25.6.35) again, the Kuwait delegates said they had already made it perfectly clear that they could not agree to give the 'guarantee* demanded, giving reasons, and urged that the Saudi Delegates should either now modify their last proposals in respect of 'guarantee* business, or inform the King of their (Saudi Delegates 1 ) final proposals and the Kuwait reply. &amp; parked 'E' Translation of Kuwait letter is submitted with this •Translation of a letter dated the 16th Kabi f Miwal 1364, corresponding to the 17th June 1936, fro® Messrs.Ahmad al-Htmialdhi, Mubamnnd bin ‘Ihunal yan al-Ghanim, and Khalid az-Eaid (Kuwait delegates), to Messrs.Xhalid Abul Walid, Hamad as-Sulalraan # and ^Abdulla al-Qusaibi (Sa’udi delegates) at Kuwait. ——oOo— After compliments. la view of what Is Known to you and to us, and also to ©very high born and poor person, of the good and friendly relations which have existed for very many years between the Al 3abah and the Al Sa’ud dynasties, more especially between His Majesty King f Abdul 9 Aziz and His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-.Tahir, and in consequence of the desire of both countries to further strengthen these relations, by removing the trade blockade of Kuwait, we have suggested below, the most suitable method as seemed to us, for the resumption of the export trad© (from Kuwait) with His Majesty*s Kingdom. These are as follows:- (1) That Custom© Collecting Centres should be established within the frontiers of His Majesty the King - These may consist of one post or more than one, and in such places as His Majesty the King may choose. (a) That His Kxceliency Ghalkh Ahmad el-Jabir shall, for his part, assist to the best of his power in the control and guiding of all exports to the above posts or centres - This will be by means of manifests, which will be issued in triplicate; the first copy to go with the goods the second to ba handed over to His Majesty’s local agent -’Abdulla an-Hafisi, and the third on® to remain in the customs office of the local Government.

We explained to you that the 'guarantee' basis, which you demanded in yesterday’s meeting, could not possibly be realized, in spite of every good intention and effort on our part; for as we explained the first case of smuggling that occurred would not only upset the plan, but would tend to have exactly the opposite result where the good agreement and connections desired by both His Majesty’s Sa’udi Govern ment and our Government is deafe concerned.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4218/318/25] Record of the Fourth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on The first subject to be discussed was the question of the eastern and south- eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Mr RENDER said that no further progress appeared for the moment to be possible, and that it was now for each side to consider the arguments put forward by the other. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, would await the statement which Euad Bey had promised at the last meeting regarding the diras or tribal areas of the three and a half tribes claimed by Ring Abdul Aziz, with particular reference to the southern sector of the boundary proposed by His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel said that it would be particularly useful if Euad Bey could accompany this statement with a map which could show roughly (in, say, gradations of shading or colour) the areas claimed as exclusively, predominantly or only partially inhabited, or wandered over, by particular tribes. EUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he would have difficulty in meeting this latter request, but that he hoped shortly to have ready a list of over 150 names of wells, water-holes, &amp;c., showing to which tribes and sections or sub-sections of tribes they were regarded as belonging. Mr. RENDEL expressed the hope that the statement might be available as soon as possible; but he explained that it would, of course, have to be referred to the British authorities in the Gulf and at Aden, so that it might be some weeks before His Majesty’s Government could reply to it. Mr. RENDEL then said that he wished to speak to Fuad Bey about the Saudi blockade of Koweit, or rather, since Fuad Bey did not like that term, about the problem of the economic relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. He began by outlining to Fuad Bey the information contained in the latest telegrams from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the position reached in the local conference which had recently been taking place at Koweit between the delegates of the sheikh and those of King Abdul Aziz. It appeared from these telegrams that, while the King was ready to adopt the Sheikh of Koweit’s suggestion of a customs and manifest system, he had instructed the Saudi delegates to insist as a condition that the Sheikh of Koweit should give a guarantee that no single smuggler from Koweit would be allowed to cross the border. In the event of this guarantee failing on more than three occasions to prove effective, the Saudi Government would terminate any agreement reached. This guarantee the Koweit delegates had naturally been unable to give. They had, however, promised to give instead an undertaking on Koweit’s honour that Koweit would do her best to stop smuggling. At this stage the Saudi delegates had explained that they had no authority to go beyond the King’s orders. They had consequently closed down the negotiations and returned to Nejd. [456 e—1] B July 5, 1935. THE following were present:— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite, India Office. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. I. II.Mr. Rendel pointed out that there was no legal obligation on a country having low tariffs to prevent smuggling into a country whose tariffs were high. The problem was one of frequent occurrence and, to take an example on a very much larger scale, had occurred between His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government in the days of prohibition in the United States. On that occasion His Majesty’s Government, though under no legal obligation to prevent the export of liquor to the United States, had, in the interests of good relations, voluntarily agreed to come to an arrangement under which they co-operated to check liquor smuggling. In a small way the position was analogous in Koweit, where the sheikh had now offered to co-operate for the purpose of checking smuggling into Saudi Arabia. But it was quite impossible for any country, even the most highly organised, to guarantee not to allow a single smuggler through. The Saudi Government’s demand could therefore only be described as unreasonable. Mr. Rendel regretted that the conference should have broken down in this unsatisfactory manner when agreement appeared to have been reached on the main problem. He wished to repeat that this question of Koweiti-Saudi relations was one to which His Majesty’s Government attached particular importance. It was one of the main objects of His Majesty’s Government to ensure that Saudi relations with Koweit should now be regularised and set right on the same lines as had been so successfully followed in the case of Saudi relations first with Iraq and then with Transjordan. He hoped, therefore, that Fuad Bey might be able to arrange for the conference to be resumed. Mr. LAITHWAITE also stressed the desire of the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India to see this result achieved and the great importance which they attached to the disposal of the question. As regards the Saudi Government’s insistence on a guarantee, Mr. Laithwaite said that it seemed clear from the history of the last few years that the Saudi Government were in a position to impose an effective blockade on the land frontier of Koweit and to deal with any persons who might be caught smuggling across that land frontier. That being so, a demand on Koweit for a guarantee such as had been suggested would seem, to say the least of it, superfluous. He drew Fuad Bey’s attention to the fact that if the Saudi Government’s demands were to be made public they could not fail to show King Abdul Aziz in an invidious light, and indeed might well give the impression that he was not really seeking a settlement. Mr. Laithwaite added that the Saudi delegates’ difficulties in negotiating, even with the help of the telegraph, were of course understood by His Majesty’s Government, but he reminded Fuad Bey that Koweit was ready to promise on her honour to do her best to stop the smuggling, and he made it clear that His Majesty s Government for their part would do all in their power to ensure that this undertaking was observed. He trusted therefore that Fuad Bey would be able to suggest some way in which the Saudi Government could be induced to relax their insistence on an absolute guarantee. FUAD BEY HAMZA, in reply, explained that, while the Saudi Legation had leceived some information as to the progress of the negotiations at Koweit, they were not yet in possession of full details as to the points on which those negotiations had broken down. The information now given to him helped to ma e the position clearer. He now understood that the following; proposals had been made :— o r- r (a) A system of customs posts through which trade would be canalised. ( ) system of manifests to be operated in coniunction with the system of customs posts. (c) An honourable undertaking by Koweit to do all she could to prevent smuggling across the Saudi border. This having been confirmed, Fuad Bey undertook to make enquiries by tele graph of his Government and expressed the hope that he would shortly be in a position to make some statement on the matter. At this point Mr. Laithwaite withdrew. 111 . The meeting then proceeded to discuss the future ^f the Treaty of Je Entir! 6 co . nn ® c ^ d . of the suggested abandonment by His Majes Go\ eminent of their right of manumission.Mr. RENDEL said that he wished first of all to dispose of a misunder standing to which Fuad Bey had given expression in conversation with bir JL. Oliphant on the previous day. It appeared that Fuad Bey had gained the impression during the conversations which were held in London in September 1934, that His Majesty’s Government had declared their willingness to renew the Treaty of Jedda in the manner now proposed by the Saudi Government, but that Fuad Bey had now found, to his surprise and regret, that they had since changed their minds. Mir. Rendel said he was satisfied, and had confirmed fiom the records of the 1934 conversations, that Fuad Bey was under a misapprehension on this point. His Majesty’s Government had never taken any decision about the future of the Treaty of Jedda,and had not gone back on anything that had been said to Fuad Bey' on that subject last year. He cited once more the three possibilities which had been discussed in i934 and which had again been quoted by Sir A. Ryan at the meeting held on the 2nd July. Of these three, the negotiation of an entirely new treaty covering all points at issue and drawn up in accordance with present conditions naturally seemed the most workmanlike. This could, however, only take place when the major questions now outstanding had been settled, and as it now looked as though a settlement of these questions might take longer than had at first been anticipated, the conclusion of such a new comprehensive °treaty might in consequence be delayed for a considerable time. This being so he could see no objection in principle to the prolongation of the present treaty in the way suggested by Fuad Bey Hamza, if agreement could be reached in regard to any modifications of the provisions of the Jedda settlement which it was desired at the same time to introduce. Mr. Rendel reminded Fuad Bey that it had been agreed at a previous meeting that the principal topic to be discussed before the Jedda settlement could be prolonged and amended in this way was the question of slavery in relation to His Majesty’s right of manumission. Fie drew attention once more to the strength of public and parliamentary opinion in this country on the subject of slavery, and of the important influence of the anti-slavery societies. It was therefore essential that His Majesty’s Government should be able to justify any decision which they might reach to abandon their right of manumission, on the lines contemplated in the original exchange of notes, by being able to show that a new situation now existed in Arabia which rendered the maintenance of that right inappropriate or unnecesary. He added, speaking personally and unofficially, that the draft anti-slavery regulations which Fuad Bey had communicated privately to Sir A. Ryan seemed to him to provide a hopeful basis for further discussion. It had not yet, however, been possible to submit the details of these proposals to the Secretary of State and it would be necessary, before any undertaking could be given to the Saudi Government, to submit to Sir Samuel Hoare a detailed statement showing the precise scope of the proposed Saudi regulations. It was only thus that Ministers would be able to judge whether the new arrangements would be sufficient to enable them to make an adequate defence in Parliament for the abandonment by His Majesty’s Government of this important and well-known right. Mr. Rendel suggested that it would be of great assistance from the point of view of further progress if Fuad Bey Hamza could give a firm undertaking that King Abdul Aziz would, when the time came, be ready to promulgate regulations on the lines of those now under discussion. SIR ANDREW RYAN then explained the progress which he had been able to make on the previous day in a conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza (see separate record in E 4163/325/25) and gave it as his opinion, subject to one or two difficult points, that a promising position had now been reached as regards slavery. There were, however, other points which needed consideration in connexion with the future of the Treaty of Jedda, some of which had already been raised by the Saudi Government. He mentioned the question of the arms traffic as an example. He pointed out, however, that, if only in view of the close questioning which His Majesty’s Government must be prepared io face, the problem of slavery was the most serious. FUAD BEY HAMZA again pressed for an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would in principle be prepared to prolong tne 1 reaty of Jeada. Mr. RENDEL replied that, while he was not yet authorised to give a formal assurance to this effect, he did not think that His Majesty s Government would [456 e—1] B 24 be likely to raise any objection in principle to an exchange of notes which would amount to a declaration that neither party would denounce the Treaty of Jedda for a period of years, provided that, as he had said befoie, agi cement could be reached on any modification in the provisions of the settlement which the Saudi Government wished to take this opportunity to secuie. The discussion then reverted to the question of slavery and manumission. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that this question could only be pursued on a basis of complete confidence between the two parties He realised that His Maiesty’s Government would require to have advance knowledge of the anti- •slaverv legislation which the Saudi Government intended to promulgate. He doubted however, whether the Saudi Government would be willing to communi cate the exact terms of the proposed legislation to His Majesty s Government. He suggested that His Majesty’s Government should be content with an understanding as to what should be covered by the legislation and leave the actual drafting to the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey again emphasised the importance of avoiding any impression that internal Saudi legislation was being carried out at the dictation of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. RENDEL explained that His Majesty’s Government fully realised the importance of avoiding this impression. On the other hand, they must be in a position adequately to defend their abandonment of the right of manumission, and this could only be done if the legislation, in consideration of which the right of manumission would, in fact, be abandoned, could be legalded as satisfactory. They could not, therefore, give any undertaking about the eventual abandonment of their right without precise knowledge of the provisions of the contemplated legislation. It was, however, just as much in the inteiest of the Saum Govern ment as of His Majesty’s Government that the legislation should be actually enacted before His Majesty’s Government abandoned their light of manumission, since if His Majesty’s Government could say that new legislation had been voluntarily enacted by King Abdul Aziz and that a new situation had thereby been produced, and actually existed, which justified them in abandoning their right of manumission, it would look far less as though a bargain had been struck than if the right of manumission were abandoned simultaneously with, or in advance of, the promulgation of the legislation in question. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that the Saudi Government must have a private guarantee that if the legislation were passed His Majesty’s Government would then abandon their right of manumission. SIR A. RYAN restated the procedure, which he himself had had in mind and which, if adopted, would involve three stages, viz., (1) a private but binding agreement that, if the Saudi Government promulgated legislation on certain lines, His Majesty’s Government would renounce the right of manumission; (2) the promulgation of the Saudi legislation; and (3) the public renunciation of the right of manumission as part of the suggested arrangements for prolonging the validity of the Treaty of Jedda. Mr. RENDER saw no difficulty in regard to the private guarantee suggested by Fuad Bey provided His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the nature pf the legislation. Indeed, if they were not, the position would be impossible, as they would not then be able to make an adequate defence before Parliament of their abandonment of their right. Although the exchange of notes might not actually need ratification, and Parliament was not technically concerned with ratifications, it would be necessary for any new agreement to be laid before Parliament, and it would never do if parliamentary criticism could not be adequately met. On the other hand, if His Majesty’s Government were supplied with full and precise information as to the contemplated legislation, Ministers would then be able to judge whether that legislation would enable them to meet- parliamentary criticism and to carry Parliament with them when the right of manumission came to be abandoned. The question whether the modification of a treaty instrument which had been ratified would itself need ratification— i.e., whether the proposed exchange of notes would have to be subject to ratifica tion—-was a question somewhat outside his province, on which the necessary technical advice would be obtained.FUAD BEY HAMZA then said that if His Majesty’s Government, rather than prolong the Treaty of Jedda as proposed, preferred to wait until an entirely new treaty could be negotiated, or for any other reason did not wish to prolong the treaty in the manner now proposed, the Saudi Government would not object. In that event, he suggested that the question of slavery and manumission could be simply dealt with in a separate exchange of notes without bringing in the Treaty of Jedda at all. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that this was an entirely new suggestion, and doubted whether it would be a satisfactory one. In practice the Jedda settlement, i.e., the Treaty of Jedda and notes attached thereto, had always been treated as a whole. There might well be serious objections to any attempt to deal with the settlement piecemeal, and he thought that His Majesty’s Government would probably prefer Fuad Bey’s original suggestion, that the Treaty of Jedda should be prolonged and agreed modifications introduced by an exchange of notes covering all the ground. This led to a further discussion of the prolongation or modification of the exchange of notes (Nos. 5 and 6) regarding purchases of arms by the Saudi Government. Mr. RENDEL suggested, and FUAD BEY agreed, that this was a point of form rather than of substance. There was no question of His Majesty’s Govern ment treating the Saudi Government in a less favourable way than any other friendly country in a similar position. The question of arms traffic was not dealt with in his department, and he would have to consult the competent authorities before saying more than this. By the words £ ‘ in a similar position ” he meant there were certain countries where, in the interests of the Governments concerned, it had been internationally agreed that arms should only be supplied to the Governments themselves or to importers specifically approved by those Govern ments. The intention of this arrangement had been to prevent arms being used by rebel tribesmen, and he cited the revolt of Ibn Rifada as one where the limitation of the import of arms to approved importers operated to the advantage of King Abdul Aziz. If then there were some such general international limitation applicable to countries in the same position as Saudi Arabia, he did not think any difficulty need be caused by provision being made for it in anv arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government. It would be time enough, however, to decide what were the most suitable arrange ments on this point when agreement had been reached on the main question of the prolongation of the Jedda settlement and of the abandonment of His Majesty’s Government’s right of manumission. x\n allusion was also made to the question of the prevailing language of the treaty. Mr. RENDEL said that this was also mainly a formal and technical point on which the competent authorities would have to be consulted in due course. At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A. RYAN undertook to produce a single comprehensive statement of the position reached in his discussions on slavery with Fuad Bey, showing the lines on which the Saudi Government might be prepared to legislate. Steps might also be taken, he thought, to consult other departments of the Foreign Office regarding the arms traffic and the technical questions of form that had been mentioned.ore 9 ill July 1935. !=y dear telcolm, feny tlmnks for your notes on ut.: Meting with Fuaa Hama* 1 have one or two tdnor alterations to suggest in &amp;y retries.

Malcolm# I. The first subject to be discussed was the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. MR. RMDEL Said that no further progress appeared for the moment to be possible, and that it was now for each side to consider the % - f;' 'V * ‘• ' - * , 1 i e h.‘- i IV -- • •# ' - ■ ;# arguments put forward by the other. His Majesty's Government* for their part, would await the statement which Fuad Bey had promised at the last meeting regarding the dlra s or tribal areas of the tliree and a half tribes claimed by King Abdul Asia, with particular reference to the southern sector of the boundary..boundary proposed by His Majesty’s Government. Hr. Hendel said that it would be particularly useful if Fuad Bey could accompany this state ment with a aap which could show roughly (in, say, gradations of shading or colour) the areas 1 claimed as exclusively, predominantly or only partially inhabited, or wandered over, by particular tribes. 'fi3k J mm BUY HAMZA explained that he would hove difficulty in meeting this latter request, . J. . - 1 , i ».

In the event of tills guarantee failing nore tlvan three tines to prove effective, the Saudi Government would terminate any agreement reached. This guarantee the Koweit delegates had naturally been unable to give. They had however . practised to give instead an undertaking on Koweit's honour that Koweit would do her best to stop smuggling* At this stage the Saudi delegates had explained that they had no authority to go 'beyond the King's orders# They had consequently closed down the negotia tions and returned to Mejd. MR REMDBh pointed out that there was no legal obligation on a country haring low tariffs to prevent smuggling' into a country wliose tariffs were high. The pi diem was one of frequent occurrence, and to take 'an example on a very much larger scale, had occurred oetween his higesty's Goverment and the United y^ates Government in the days of prohibition inthe tfe&amp;ted States. His MftjestT^s Got M$ though tmder no legal obligation to eo-operate had in the interests of good relations %’olimtarily agreed to cose to an arrangement under which they co-operateci to chock pSP f \iing into the United States# In &amp; small my tie position was analogous in loweit where the Sheikh had now offered to co-operate for the purpose of checking snuggling into Saudi Arabia.* But it was quite impossible for any country, even the most highly organised, to guarantee not to allow a single smuggler through# Phe Saudi (rOTOrnment’s demand could therefore only be described as unreasonable. Mr. RendeX regretted that the- conference should, have broken down in this unsatisfactory mnner when agreement appeared to have been reached on the min problem. He wished to repeat that this question of !:'oweiti- Saudi relations was one to which His Majesty’s Government attached particular importance. ‘ It | ms* one of the min objects of His Majesty’s Govehnent#. •Goyorrmerit to aasace tot.Saudi relatiOBS with Koweit . should now he regularised and set right cm the same lines as had been so successfully followed I to U* oaee or W rolatio,,, firot wlto Iraq aad then with Trans,joi'daa. lie hoped M therefore that Fuad Bey night he able to arrange for the eonference to he restmed. HR LAXIiKAITR also stressed the desire of tiie Secretary of State for India and the Govern ment of India to see this result acliie regards the Saudi Government's insistence on a guarantee, hr. Laithwaite pointed out that, as F'' ; the Saudi hlocMde of Ease it already, appeared to i he extremely effective a demand for such a guarantee hy lioseit would seer.,to say the least of it, superfluous. m drew Puad Bey's attention . to ' tae fs °t that if the Saudi Government's demands were to he mane public they, could not fail to show King Abdul Aziz in an invidious light, and indeed might well give the impression notj th8t il€ was Wiy seeking a settlement.

III, qJL. c The meeting then proceed^ to discuss the fu.t-tro ♦V- tmi future oi' Treaty of Jedda and t’ae connect, e« question of the suggested abandonment by His Majesty's Goveraaent of their right;of manmissioa. HE. iiEIDEL said that he wished first of all to dispose of a misunderstanding to vMch i-uad Bey had given expression in conversation with Sir L.Qliphant on the previous day* It ♦ -■ J »•* ■ V* appeared that Fuad.

H*» cited once more the three possibilities which \ * had been discussed in 1934 and which had again been quoted by dir A. ttyan at tiie meeting held ,? fl ‘ !a ^y 2nd.

He ad&amp;M ? speaking personally and unofficially that the draft anti-slavery regulations which Fuad Bey j had comunicated privately to -Sir A. Kyan seemed to him to provide a hopeful basis for .further discussion. It imd not yet however bean possible to submit the details of these praoshls to ministers and it would be necessary, beforeany mdertalcing could be given to the Saudi Govorraent, to snteit to the Secrotayy of State a detailed statement showing the precise scope of the proposed Saudi regulations* It m$ only this that Ministers would he iddh* to judge &gt; » whether the'new nrtmiQement^ would he sufficient in Parliament to enable them to make ah-adequate defence/for the ahaiidennent by 'His- Majesty’s Gorevment of this important and' well-known right* MitiRendel suggested that it would he of great assistance from the point of view of furtlier progress if Fuad Bey Emm. could give a fim undertaking that King Abdul A sis would, when the time came, he ready to pitmulgate regulations on the lines ; of those now under discussion* SIR KhDEKW RYA1? tlien explained the progress’ which lie had been able to make on the previous ■ V'» . h r ;■; e • ■ . 1 u r - ‘l a conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza (see separate record in E*4165/S25/25) and gave it as his opinion that a promising position had now been reached as regards slavery.

Reference paragraph 103 (h) of Surnma,ry llc # 9. 7^'^ The Saudi Delegatee arrived in seven lorries and six touring cars' from Hoffuf on 17th June, after having lost their way in the desert \^\\^ and nearly coming to a had end from thirst. (A full report of what happened, has heen sent to Bushire under separate letter). The delegates were accompanied hy an entourage of 83 persons, including guards, drivers, servants, clerks etc. This put a severe strain on the entertaining branch of the Shaikh’s household. 3. Discussions were opened with the Kuwait Delegates on the 18th June, and were continued to 24th June, after which an exchanges of letters began to take place, and have done so to the time of writing this. 4. By 25th June it became very clear that unless a miracle happened and the Saudi delegates modified their impossible demands, the Conference was doomed to failure. 5. The position on that day was as follows:- The Kuwait Delegates had put forward their proposals, namely that as they were anxious to reopen trade witn Q.asim 6c He jd , and were willing and anxious topay full Customs duty on all goods going into He,i d , the Saudi Government should, for their part, agree to have one or more Customs Posts on the Frontier to take such Customs duty, and that Kuwait should allow no caravan bound ^ or ^ ' t0 leave the city, unless aimed with a manifest showing the amount of goods it carried. That e. duplicate of this manifest would be sent by Kuwait to the Saudi Government through A1 Hafisi, and that third copy be kept in Kuwait for record. That the above system would insure all caravans going to the Saudi Customs posts andThe Saudi Delegates in reply laid it down as a necessary preliminary to the opening of any discussions, that the Kuwait Government should agree to give a written document 'guaranteeing” that in the event of the Customs and Manifest System 'being introduced 'all smuggling” across the Saudi frontier should cease. When asked to define what was meant 'by ”all smuggling”? and how failure to enforce 'guarantee” would 'be treated, the Saudi delegates stated that 'by ”all smuggling', was meant even ' an individual smuggler ” and that the Saudi Government would prohably let Kuwait off with a caution for the first three cases of smuggling brought to their notice, but for the fourth case, even if committed by a single- in dividual . the Saudi Government would cancel any agreement arrived at, and revert to the Blockade. The Kuwait delegates pointed out that they naturally could not agree to such an absurd condition, and countered by promising that 'Kuwait would give her word of honour to do her best to stop all smuggling into Held, and would punish drastically all smugglers caught on the Kuwait side of the border”, and that they hoped this would satisfy. Up to the time of writing this Summary, there is no sign whatever that the Saudi Delegates intend to modify their conditions, and from the various conversations that have taken place, it is pretty obvious that they have no desire that5 that any agreement should succeed, and probably stsorted out from Hofxuf with the deliberate intention of causing the Conference to fail. 10. The writer under orders from H.M.Government attended all discussions. This was a good move as it enabled him to note down and record full notes of the proceedings. (These latter have been embodied in a separate report and have been submitted to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (a) Prom the haughty and overbearing attitude displayed by the Saudi Delegates at all meeting^, it was early evident that they (the delegates) felt that they had the whip hand completely of Kuwait, and meant to show it. (b) Throughout the discussions the Saudi Delegates adopted the following uncompromising £ole “The Blockade suits us down to the ground, our trade is benefiting at the expense of Kuwait, that is good business - We are keeping within the law that also is good policy, as H.M. Government, your protector, cannot get at us - You are like a man in prison, if you offer us enough money we will let you out - Make it worth our while, and we will raise the Blockade 1 *. (c) To my mind one sided conferences of the above nature are more than useless and only tend to still further embitter relations. Certainly Kuwait is highly indignant already at the patronizing way in which her delegates have been so far treated. (d) I should also like to record my belief (though I say this with all due deference and fullest apology, seeing that what I say concerns Bahrain, a place outside my control) that the only ultimate way of bringing Bin Baud’s Blocks.de of Kuwait to an end, is to hurt or threaten to hurt him elsewhere - This can in my opinion best be done in the Persian Gulf, and by (i) Allowing Bahrain to impose full Bahrain duty on all goods in transit to Hejd . (ii) Allowing Bahrain to take full duty on cargo transferred into dhows from steamers if latter are in Bahrain f waters.

Subject: Kuwait Neutral Zone Oil Concession. Kuwait Blockade. 316-S of 1935. Dated 24th April, 1935. I I enclose herewith extract paragraphs 4 to 10 from an Express Letter No.C-93, dated the 8 th April 1935, from the Political Agent, Kuwait. 2. Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 give the views of the Shaikh on an Oil Concession in the Neutral Zone. Paragraphs 7 and 8 give the Shaikh’s assurance that on his side the negotiations with the Saudi delegates will be carried on in a harmonious atmosphere. Paragraph 9 contains an interesting and fresh suggestion by the Shaikh for a settlement with Ibn Saud of the Blockade question. (Sd.) T.C. Powle, Lieut. Colonel.

I here deemed it time to turn the conversation to the coming blockade conference and especially the point of my visit; so after some preliminary heart to heart observations to which the Shaikh reacted extremely well, I read out the gist of telegrams (2) + and (3) = referred to at the beginning of this Note - in other words I conveyed your message and that of His Majesty's Government. The Shaikh listened very attentively and then disarmed me somewhat by smilingly observing as follows:- 'I see that both Colonel Powle and His Majesty’s Government are justly angry with me for having suggested that two delegates should come to Kuwait only, they need not be however, for I was just on the point of telling you myself today that I myself realised already that I had acted too quickly, and desired to withdraw my remarks to you of the 4th April and also my letter of the same date (see enclosure)”. He then went on to say that he desired me to telegraph to you at once and say that he had decided not only to receive the three Saudi delegates as soon as they were ready to come from Bahrain, but that he would do every honour to them, and put them up in his own palace and for as long as they liked. Further that all he had said on the 4th April has been born of panic at hearing that the redoubtable Philby was on his way to Kuwait to try conclusion with him. 8 . The Shaikh ended by asking me to be sure to make you and His Majesty’s Government happy, on the score of the talks to / + Political Resident’s telegram No.T/114. = India Office telegram No.1116.to Tse held with the Saudi delegates. These would he carried on as sweetly as honey (his words) and he (the Shaikh) would of' course listen to all the Saudi representatives had to say and would weigh all their proposals in the balance - Yet he felt bound to repeat, added the Shaikh, that he must for the sake of the eventual salvation of his State and his people, concentrate on the Customs posts and manifest system and make that the major issue. 9. The only possible alternative, he said, (and he had spent many months and years thinking over the matter) was for Bin Saud himself to give him a personal letter under his own seal and signature to the effect that he (Bin Saud) appointed him (Shaikh Ahmad) as his personal collector of all customs taxes on exports going out from Kuwait to Nejd, and that he (Bin Saud) would rely on his brother Ahmad’s honour and word as a noble Arab, to 'play fair', and should there be good or poor customs returns, he (Bin Saud) would never complain or murmur. 10. I give the above curious suggestion from the Shaikh exactly as he gave it to me - There is a good deal to be said for it, I think, but I agree with the Shaikh that Bin Saud is hardly likely to agree to such a way of settling the trouble, xxxxxxxx14—6130 10950 (2 EXEO n 7 In any further communication on this subject, please quote no.^t jrsv/jLot/xf' j , „ .

(k) The Saudi Delegates for the Blockade Conference which was to have been held in Kuwait in May, have not as yet arrived, and there are growing indications that the King himself is not over anxious that they should put in an appearance. He appears to be seizing on every excuse he can possibly think of, as a means for postponing the 'evil day'. At the time of writing he has seized upon the Shaikh's protest regarding the abu Shijara armed party incident (see para. 87 of Intelligence summary Ho. 8 ), to hold up the delegates departure indefinitely. He has cleverly tried to make out that the party in question were innocently trying to reach Kuwait via Jahara , when they were rounded up, and harshly turned out of the State, as if they were malefactors.CONFIDENTIAL, No. c-159 # n •ii; it ■ .P The Political Agent at Kuwait presents his compliments to ( 1 ) Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Kuwait.

This opinion is confirmed hy note summarised in my telegram No.121. The conference may fail in any case hut if you still attach importance to it as a stage in our efforts to settle blockade question, I now consider that the best course would be to reply to that note on the lines suggested in my telegram No.122 and inform Saudi Government simultaneously that while number of attendants whom they propose to send with the delegates is much greater than His Majesty’s Government had expected I feel they will raise no objection to their entry into Koweit. 6 .

Political Agent informed me on May 28th that while Sheikh saw no necessity for this he had no objection but trusted numbers would be reasonable. 2. Saudi Government now state that delegates will be accompanied by 50 people including 23 guards besides drivers and servants. They invoke local customs and cited precedent of Sheikh.’s visit to Pdyadh in 1933. 3. It is clear from correspondence that Ibn Baud persists in connecting question with our protest against incident of May 6th. I did not foresee this unfortunate result but Political Resident's express letter No. 317 April^25th convinces me more than ever that protest was necessary. 4. Question now arises whether we should swallow counter demonstration on above scale in order to save the conference. This depends partly on whether numbers appear as formidable to authorities at Koweit as to me. 5. You may prefer to take line that in all the circumstances you prefer to postpone the matter until I can report personally in London.6. Incidentally delegation is to include Abdul Aziz QusalM as well as ,T anad Buliman and Khalid Qarqani. There may be objection to Qusaibi. 7.

It will, I think, be of interest to you and His Majesty f s Government to learn what Philby has had to say on the subject of both Kuwait-Nejd Smuggling , and the probable line the Saudi delegates will take in their coming Blockade discussions . XXX XX X 4. Philby f s views on “smuggling* into Nejd from Kuwait were given with candour and frankness, but clearly showed that he had got them from prejudiced sources, and that he had only studied the question superficially (he made several f statements which were untrue). He admitted that what he said reflected the ideas of the King. 6. Among other things Philby aesured me (a) that smuggling into Nejd continued to be very heavy. (b) that in spite of this, Bin Saud f s blockade was slowly but surely bringing Kuwait to her knees and that Bin Saud knew this perfectly well. (c) that Bin Saud had no personal grudge against Kuwait, but believed, like himself (Philby), that Kuwait had no right at all to exist as an independent State. (d) that as Aar population were all Nejdi by origin, they naturally were the subjects of Saudiyeh and would always be so considered by the King. (e) that the people of Kuwait one and all wanted Bin Saud to rule over them and not Ibn Subah. (f) that therefore it was ethically wrong that a single family like Ibn Subah should have it in their power to hold the best port in Arabia, and deny it to its rightful lord, just because His Majesty*s Government chose /chose to give support to that family - He for one thought His Majesty's Government was putting them selves terribly in the wrong in this matter, and opined that if she withdrew her protection the people of Kuwait would of themselves ask Bin Saud to rule over them at once. (g) Iraq claims to Kuwait were ridiculous and would not be tolerated at all by the King* 6* When I asked Philby what sort of men composed the Saudi Commission that was shortly to come to Kuwait, he replied that they were all eminently reasonable Hejdis, but could be counted to give nothing away* ?» When I asked if he knew what sort of proposals they would put forward for settling the impasse with Kuwait, Philby replied 'It is not their business to put forward proposals it is up to Kuwait to do this - the King naturally wants the 'status quo”, he wants no settlement, his object is to starve Kuwait into submission, for it is only a question of time when this will happen* In Mubarak's time Kuwait customs revenue was 13 lacs, to-day it is 1 lac* If in 23 years the Kuwait customs has dropped from 13 to 1, I leave it to you, Dickson, to calculate when it will become nothing”. 8* I then asked whether he thought the King would agree to come to an agreement on the principle of customs posts and manifests, Philby said 'Ho certainly not”. This would involve Bin Saud in expense where now he has none - “Why should he spend money to please Kuwait and His Majesty's Government. 9 * 'Pq my query as to what he personally thought Bin Saud would agree to, he replied that as far he knew Bin Saud might /&gt;3- might accept one of two things (a) A lump sum down annually from the Shaikh of Kuwait (b) Some sort of transit duty system, but 'remember' he added ' we do not want a settlement'® 10. Throughout our talk Philby gave every indication that he had the King r s ear, and was his close admirer and so spoke with authority: This though it may only have been bombast, may be significant* 11 o I £f course am an old friend of Philby and no doubt this fact made him speak possibly more openly, than he would have done elsewhere. 12 . The above remarks are, I consider, interesting and highly important as they bear out exactly what the ohaixh of Kuwait is never tired of saying day in and day out, naiaelv that the work of the delegates is not only going to be a farce for the simple reason that they will have had previous instruc tions not to agree to any Customs post and manliest system (the only tning acceptable to Kuwait), but that the real intention of Bin Saud is to manoeuvre Kuwait into a false position with His Majesty’s Government* In other words Bin Saud will be able to say to His Majesty’s Government and to the people of Kuwait, if the conference fails, 'You see, I told you so, my delegates made several most reasonable offers, but brother Ahmad, stiff necked and unaccommodating as ever, will agree to nothing I propose, I leave His Majesty's Govern ment and Kuwait merchants to judge who is at fault therefor, I or him'• 13,, In this way, as Shaikh Ahmad says, it is hoped by Bin Saud that he, Ahmad, will once again, he condemned by His Majesty's Government as the unreasonable villain of the piece and will more particularly lose popularity in the eyes of his own hard pressed people. 14„ /14* I myself cannot but help (with my long local experience) being fully and entirely in agreement with all that the Shaikh says in this matter, for we must never forget that he is up against the M big bad wolf' than whom nobody in Arabia is so cunning* 15* I trust that His Majesty^ Government will bear the above remarks of Shaikh in mind, as the time draws near for the conference to be held*NO DISTRIBUTI Decypher# No 0 114« Sir A# Ryan 3 (Jedda) 9 15th May, 1935&lt; 5 &lt;,00 poiiu 15 th May1955 o 4*45 p.m. 15th May, 1955o “O ~0 -O -O -O -0-0 “O -0 - Political Resident’s telegram NocTo.142 to the India Office* I mentioned this incident to Yusuf Yasin this morning and said that it filled me with grave personal anxiety at present junctureo He said he knew of no officer of the name given and suggested party might have entered Koweit without reference to any responsible authority* I admitted this was possible but said that there appeared to be no doubt of the main facts* Unless Yusuf Yasin forestalls further representations by immediate explanation I consider I should be instructed to address strong protest and demand for satisfaction to Saudi Government without delays I do not think this y/ould have any adverse effecr on our relations with Ibn Saud or on prospects of Koweit conference with which I would not propose to connect the matter officially* In case you approve I am asking the Political Agent, Koweit, for fuller detaii.So Addressed to Foreign Office Noell4? repeated to Koweit No*122, Political Resident at Bagdad No«125, Government of India No*69o4trfa r] A FiB/DIAo &gt; J i s 1 (103 groups) 26S6o * q x' p: ' i i ZJ -.j | D .
