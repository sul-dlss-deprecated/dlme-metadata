The Sultan replied that he had no objection whatever. 3. Why we want these figures is that we are interested in the financial, as well as the political, stability of the Muscat State, and when about 20 years ago the State was bankrupt it was the Government of India who had to come to its assistance with a loan. The State seems fairly prosperous now, but if its finances took a turn for the worse we ought to know before things got too bad, in order to give a word of advice to the Sultan, and the only way we can know is by getting figurei regularly. This, of course, is hardly an argument one can use with the Sultan. Major R.l. Watts, I.A. Political Agent, Muscat.P. A. Tne Sultan has since furnished tne statements 01 the financial position of the Slate as it stood on 1st Janaury of the years 1938 and 1939, The Sultan would probably continue to let us have this statement in future but its accuraoyvouid largely depend on tne man in charge of the State Revenues who might not supply us tne correct information as you will see from the figures below that there is a difference of ?s 43,678-10-0 in the balance of 1st January 1939.

Subject :*- / Muscat State Finances, Would you please refer to your D.O. No. 266-S dated 28th March 1939 on the above mentioned subject. 2. The reason that I did not send the usual statement of the financial position of the State *ith my letter No. 293/VIII/B-15 of 8 th Marcn was that although it had been received it was found to differ by as much as Is 43*000 odd from the actual figures as supplied by the State in their quarterly statements which were forwarded with my above quoted letter. Since that time we have been making unsuccessful efforts to find out where the real discrepancy lay. Since the departure from Muscat of the late Director of Customs there is confusion in that Department. I now forward copies of the statements of the financial position of the State for 1st January 1938 and 1939 for what they are worth, which are correct only to a margin of the discrepancy of Is 43,000 mentioned above. 3. Similar discrepancies nave been noticed in the past but in those cases the Director of Customs on being referred to rapidiy made the necessary adjustments The Honourable Lt. Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire2 adjustments himself to JLafce the totals agree, 4. As you are aware a new Director of Customs, who is a trained official of the Karachi Customs Service is shortly coming to Muscat and no doubt the figures we receive in future will be correct. The Sultan having already told you that he had no objection to supplying these statements, vide paragraph 2 of your letter under reference, I do not in the future anticipate any further trouble in this connection.Budget Heads.

Rent of aerodromesJanuary 17th, 1941 I have had time to study the figures that you gave me just before you left and there are one or two points on which I shall be grateful for information. I notice that whereas last year you showed fts. 32,000/- as being the State*s credit in the Imperial Bank at Bombay, this year no credit is mentioned in this bank. Is this an oversight or have you transferred your assets in this bank to the Muscat Treasury or has the account been closed? Under Article 10 of the Budget Estimates for 1941 you include ’’Liquor Licence Fees” but no amount has been stated. Last year fts. 1,500/- appeared under this head whereas Rs. 1,050/- were realised. Presumably there should be an anticipated revenue from these licences of Rs. 1,200/- as the licences here and in Gwadur are said to bring in that sum. If this is correct the total anticipated revenue should be Rs. 7,54,100/- and not Rs. 7,52,900/-. I shall be very grateful for an answer, if possible by return of post, as I wish to complete my annual report. 2. Mudhaffar has been in and stayed here for some days. I have seen nothing of him. After what you said about the instructions you had given before you left I made no attempt to get in touch with him directly fully expecting Saiyid Shahab to send him over. I sent the Khan Sahib to ask Shubaily un officially if he knew if Mudhaffar was calling and was very surprised His highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur Sultan of Muscat and Oman Killarney Hotel, Karachi2 surprised to hear that he had returned to Sohar. Shubaily lunched with me today and asked if I particularly wished to see Mudhaffar because if so he could be sent for, but I did not wish to take any further action in the matter in your absence feeling that there was probably some misunderstanding. I did think of seeing Saiyid Shahab and asking him for information but as I am uncertain of to what extent he is in your confidence I have decided to telegraph to you so that if you desire to you can issue instructions to him to keep me informed of the trend of affairs at Ibri and Ainane. 3. I am sorry to have to worry you with affairs of State during your holiday. I hope you found your father well and were able to surprise him. Please give him my compliments. I hope to be able to get to Karachi early next month but owing to the lament able delay in mails I have not yet heard from Colonel Prior. I will let you know my movements as soon as I do myself. I hope the Cinema has had some good programmes and that you have enjoyed them. Nothing has happened here of any note. The Military Adviser has gone to Sur in the Matrah launch and I am rather worried about him as the night they left there was a very strong Shimal and I hope nothing went wrong with the launch. The Khan Sahib is typing this letter for me.Muscat, i X sqorf ^January 31st, 1941 .'iIea , iL i o\ \of&gt;ia cJ My dear Friend, ^ •j . r .j am pleased to hear that you succeeded in surpris ing your father* I am sure he must have been very glad to see you* I had heard he was living out towards the Jail in one of the new houses that have recently been built there* Many thanks for the photographs. I do not like the one of you in glasses. Rather like the Amir Abdullah of Trans Jordan. Zawawi looks very different in Karachi to what he does in Muscat. I hope Fahr (Fahar) will do well at AJmere. I am afraid he is rather backward and it will be sometime before he can overcome the language difficulty. He has gone all Iraqi in the picture. I do hope the little Buthaimah will not be lonely away from the fl&amp;wers and scenery of Japan I hope you can persuade your father to keep her in India where she can be properly educated and possibly be of value in time to come to her father’s country. Tarik is doing well at Bait-al-Falaj so I am informed* I am glad because it looks as if he may turn into a useful citizen of Muscat. I have had several talks with Hilal bin Bedr about the Municipality. He is a man of limited ability, however that is business which I will leave until I see you. You will be glad to know that Ahmad bin Ibrahim is better but Dr. Hynes who saw him yesterday says it would not be wise for him to do any work for another ten days. I did some shooting at Sohar but the duck were very wild and on several occasions when I was crawling very laboriously towards them to get close enough for a shot some country man walked up attracted by the, to him, astonishing spectacle of myself crawling on ar my hands and knees on flat on my stomach and frightened the ducks who flew away. Still I feel much better for being away. I had two mild goes of fever just before going there and the change has made me feel more energetic. ColonelMuscat) January 31st. / My dear Friend, Many thanks for your letter of the 25th of January. The position regarding the account with the Imperial Bank is now clear. No doubt you will discuss your idea of prohibiting imports of alcohal on your return as there are various considerations involved. I am sorry that ray coming to Karachi is somewhat delayed but as you will have seen from my telegram I am prepared to come to Bombay to see you and go on from there to Delhi. I understand the Resident expects to be in Karachi in the middle of next month. The messenger from Mudhaffar that I telegraphed about has not yet arrived but I expect him today and will then see Saiyid Shahab who I have kept fully informed of the situation at Ibri etc. as far as I know it. Perhaps you will let me have your comments on the position in due course perhaps verbally if you consider the position renders your early return necessary. I am now hoping to reach India by the 10th of February and shall return here about the 25th. My regards to Saiyid Taimur whose acquaintance I hope to make in the near future.

Our Inoome has so f r tn lucre se of Rs. 90,000 over nd j^jov© th i ettiim-ted x'i^urc. This is mainly due to the rise of prices of the goods Imported and not to the Incre ge in imports which had e consider’ ble f 'll in quantity. We will do very optimistic to &lt;ax, ect a sx. .11 r income during the dhsulng year due to the prohibitive prices now prevailing in In la and other c untries from wh-ch uscat is fed. The source of income ox the inhabitants of this country is chiefly from the d te crop. They «ere luury to ^et a setter price for thexr cro* during the current year and tney may stxll sell t :eir next ye »r crop x'or ev.:n a little better price out the of .rice of date rntr^et is undouotedly far beiov, the 1 vel of the market f r the 1 ported g od«. A great de*l of loss is usually suffered oy the c tc ox. orters due to suu.cn fall of price: in India. This could Da avoided if the export of d tes was controlled by some means.

They have to accept any ^rice f v - r trv tr goods in order to get the looney oack and therefore the marAet lov for others.

Another good source of income to the Government xs from THkut collections - the total proceeds for eleven months am ount Rs. il, J ;0 against *» ), J fO a year.

December 30th, 1941. p /f From To Captain J.B. Howes, M.B.Ee, Political Agent, Muscat, Sir, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Muscat, I have the honour to forward the budget statements of the Muscat Government for the year 1942, I have included in the statements the corresponding figures from the 1941 budget, for purposes of comparison. It will be seen that the distribution of expenditure has been considerably revised by the Finance Officer, Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain Khan; and I am satisfied that this revision is judicious from the point of view of audit and control of expenditure. Before making any general comment, I would ask you to note that the revenue figures for the Vilayet of Sohar have now been included in the general heads of revenue and expenditure. As you know the Wilayet of Sohar has in the past history of Muscat been a favourite resort of disgruntled relatives of the ruling family; and I consider that it is very satisfactory that its separate identity, even in the financial field, should cease to exist. 2 . I have put the explanation of the increases and decreases as against 1941 into the form of an appendix to this letter. The upshot of the whole budget is that we have reduced our anticipated revenue from lakhs, as budgetted in 1941, to 7 lakhs; while the expenditure is budgetted at 6 lakhs 66 thousand (44 thousand being the amount budgetted for “reserve”) as against 6 lakhs 67 thousand last year. Thewm w V budgetted revenue hae been reduced to allow for expected fall in receipts due to the present world situation. This budget does not include the War Subsidy, which comes to 2 lakhs, 40 thousand per annum. 3. On 1st January 1941, the cash reserve of the State was about 24 lakhs, and investments a little lakhs. Figures are not yet available up to the end of 1941; but on 1st December, 1941, the cash reserve had risen to 3 lakhs, 19 thousand, investments being the same. In addition to this, the Sultan had drawn Rs. 74,000 just before leaving for Dhofar. This sum he is not accounting for 5 but some part may be taken as still unspent. The balance of the War Subsidy on 1st January, 1941, was just about a lakh; and it was roughly the same on 1st December, 1941. In addition to this, the Sultan took 60 thousand with him to Dhofar. This sum, again, has passed out of our purview; but a considerable portion of it may be taken as still unspent. 4. You may consider that the considerable increase in the cash 1 reserve which has taken place, is not entirely satisfactory I have, however, recently put forward two schemes for public utilities which will reduce it by 17 thousand; and have also other possibilities in mind, which I am hoping to have an opportunity to discuss with the Sultan before I leave, which would help to get the Stated reserves into a more satisfactory form than cash. 5. I have not yet, of course, got the receipt and V expenditure statement for the last quarter of 1941; but can see how the old budget has worked from the figures up to 30th September, 1941. The proportionate estimated receipts for nine months came to 6 lakhs, 64 thousand; and actual receipts were 6 lakhs, 34 thousand. Proportionate estimated expenditure comes to 6 lakhs, and actual expenditure almost exactly the same. (There is actually a saving of one thousand). We may therefore bfl Texpect a deficiency at the end of the year of just under 40 thousand; whereas the excess of budgetted receipts over budgetted expenditure was 85 thousand. Nett saving should therefore be approximately 45 thousand; and this is almost exactly the sum allotted to 'Reserve ,t in the present budget. 6 * As regards the War Subsidy; gross receipts from the beginning of the war to 31st December 1941 came to 5 lakhs, 59 thousand. Expenditure for 1939/1940, as stated by His Highness, totalled 2 lakhs, 17 thousand; and expenditure for eleven months of 1941 has been just over two lakhs. Total saving since the subsidy began is therefore, as stated above, roughly l£ lakhs. This agrees with the balances handed over by His Highness to Khan Sahib Maqbul Hussain, viz. one lakh in Muscat and half lakh with His Highness in Dhofar. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Captain, Political Agent, Muscat.APPENDIX. Revenue &gt; B.l.

In view of shipping difficulties and many restrictions imposed on export of goods from foreign countries mainly from India from which country we get the major portion of our supplies it was net expected to get better revenue from this head this year and therefore a sum of Rs. 5,40,000 was only estimated which was Rs. 40,000 short of lt)41 budget. The import of gooes as expected was very much less, but due to high prices Bfx.tH as well as import of consicerabi quantity of tea the duty improved to a great extent but not to warrant an increase of 76,000 which price of dry is mainly due to dates in India. the rise of ( 2 ) Zakat. A sum of Rs.37,000 was estimated, which amount was also far more than the amount actually realised in a year for seve ral years in the past. This amount is expected to be increased by 17000.

The nett excess expenditure is Rs.2,900 only and thus I hope to get over a lakh saved during t..e year for transfer to Reserve. In addition all the dollars in the Treasury have increased in value and gain on this account will be dhewn in my statement submitting the financial position as it will stand on the last date of this year. u T Ay comments on the proposed estimates for lu43 are as under:- A. B. Receipts . Almost all heads except Customs and Zakat • are based on 1^42 figures. Customs figures have been increased by 24,000 on the original estimates for 1942 but actually reduced by Rs. 22,000 from the anticipated receipts for that year* It is no^^y possible to foresee fchat will be the price of^miates next year and therefore it would not be correct to estimate the same for 1^43 as collected this year* • Expenditure.

I have had many representations from all quarters and several of them have left service, and many are threatening to do so. I have gone into this matter thoroughly and find it necessary to give them some increase. I have provided Rs. 12,000 for this allowance for the whole year which amount although looks large when compared with the total budget of about Ps. 700,000 but vt in actual facials quite inadequate to meet the general demand having in view the number of State officials who are labout 300 employed with Revenue Department and over i 7 000 all told.

Memorand um Kncloeed are tiie Muscat State Budget Estimates for 1944, comparative statements for the previous three years and a state ment giving the financial position of the State on January 1st 1944. The following comments are offered* Ag m ^-r. JBE£SaP T „§&gt;, 1. The unusually large Customs receipts are reported as due to increased imports of tea, coffee and pieccgoods and aleo to increased prices, on which the State takes a percentage. This system has of course assisted internal inflation, especially in the cost of staple foods which are all iaiported, but there seems no other satisfactory method of assessing Customs duties. Large quantities of uncontrolled coffee and tea come from Africa but further enquiries are being made regarding the origin of the piecegoods. 2. Increased receipts from Zakat are due to higher prices for exported dates and to collection in kind, the proceeds of which were subsequently sold at a good price. This in turn has produced a large demand from the interior for dollars and is, in conjunction with the increased value of the silver content of the dollar, responsible fox* the present very high exchange rate. The State has, however, recently introduced a system whei'eby dates are sold locally at cheap prices from Government shops. 3. The very large increase under interest and Commission' is due to tiie sale of Treasury dollars at a high r*ate of exchange.4» Brokerage Tax ie collected in doHars and the increase under this item is due to tho high exchange rate* 5* Weighing Charges are a new item and could not therefore be estimated correctly. ACTUALS - 1. Receipts, especially under Customs and Zakat, are in my opinion over-conservative and those under 'Commission, i-occnange and Interest' could be definitely revised upwards, provided the State's reserve fund is properly invested. 2. Expenditure on 'Education and Health ’ * 1 2 3 4 and 'Public Works' is again very low, although the recent subvention of &amp;. 1 , 200 /- per annum to the British Government's hospital is included under 'M - General Contingencies'. 3. It seems very likely that a sum greatly exceeding fc.38,100 will be available for the Reserve at the end of this year. 4. Expenditure on 'Civil List' is estimated as exceeding one-third of the budgeted income. It will be noted however that in 1943 it was slightly less than one-seventh of actual income. ginehaL... 1. The three columns of the statement of the State's reserve require to be added together and at the current rate of exchange amount to about 24 lakhs. Of this only Rs. 1,28,809-5-0 is invests As a working cash balance 4 lakhs are ample and the remainder should be invested. 2. The Poor Fund is an excellent institution. 3. No accounts are forthcoming from the province of Dhofar. 4. Provided efficient and honest officers are forthcoming, the State's financial position promises great administrative expansion. A reserve of 8 lakhs would be quite sufficient, thus releasing large sums for much-needed capital expenditure on improvements which are too obvious to require specific mention here but which must wait until world conditions improve. rbtv, Political Agent, Muscat.VIII-B/15 &amp; VIII-B/24 Conrirtn&gt;t.lal D.O.No.C/216. Political Agency, Muecat. 2nd February, 194*. Hub cat Staf BudiWt. 1944. ' Will you please refer to my memorandum No.C/216 of todqy 9 6 date, on the above subject ? 2. At first sight, it would appear that Khan Bahadur fitaqbul Hussain is not very good at budgeting. But I know that the Sultan took a close interest in the preparation of this budget and I imagine that the Khan Bahadur was therefore some visit restricted. 3. The Sultan looks upon Dhofar as his private € state. Tbs main reasons are, I think, freedom from local intrigue, better living conditions, and freeaom from restraint in tbs matter of lining his own pocket. How much longer public opinion will pormlt him to enjoy his privileges without assuming taeir corresponding responsibilities is a period that cannot be estimated. 1 understand, however, that he intends to return to his capital next autumn and it would be satisfactory if he were to divide his time equally between Muscat and Balaiah. 4. As regards the excessive imports of plecegoods most of these cams from Western India ports outside the Indian Customs line and were; in addition to our quota. I am elaborating this point in my reply to Davy 9 a enquiry about Ceneorehlp requirements.

The financial position in which the Muscat State now finds it self is so satisfactory that little comment on the budget estimates appears necessary. The Balance Sheet drawn up on the 1st. August shows that State then possessed a reserve of approximately 40 lakhs, and as income for the first 6 months of this financial year (Muscat’s Fir.ancAal year is fhom the 1st. January to 31st. December) exceeded expenditure to the extent of nearly 10 lakhs, it is likely that the State reserve will reach the figure of 55 lakhs at the conclusion of this financial year. 3.

To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B_U_S_H__I_R_E. Subject MUSCAT STATE BUDGET 1946. Memorandum. Enclosed are the Muscat State Budget Estimates for 1946, a statement of estimated and actual receipts and expenditure for 1945 and a statement showing the financial position of the State on the 1st January, 1946. 2. So far as the estimates are concerned, customs receipts of 15 lakhs are probably underestimated last year’s receipts having reached the figure of over 27-i- lakhs. It will be ob served that the War Subsidy has not been included under receipts while its full amount has been shown under expenditure. His Highness' explanation for this is that he wishes to plan his revenues so as to provide for the Muscat Infantry and other defense measures without depending on a subsidy which he cannot expect to receive much longer. 3. As regards the financial position of the State at the close of the year, it will be seen that revenue exceeded expenditure by Rs.194- lakhs and that expenditure was Rs. 1 lakh more than anticipated. The balance sheet on the 1st January, 1946 showed a reserve of approximately Rs.50 lakhs of which Rs.20 lakhs are to be invested in the Government of India Vic tory Loan. 4. As in previous years, the budget figures furnished by the Sultan are incomplete, oil caneoeeiom payments, duty paid by the British Overseas Airways CoronrBtion and receipts and expenditure of Diicfar province &gt;'*'?;*-£ deluded. 5. A statement showing War Subsidy expenditure during 1945 will be forwarded in due course.

Muscat• 7th April 1948.. n It is estimated that this year the production of date crops is less than what last year produced. But dates of this year are superior in quality and dearer in price. The principal date producing places are Rustaq, AwaM, Ismailif Nezwa* Maawal» Madhareb, Bidaya* Jaalan,^Batinah and Wadi bin Khaled. At present the value of dates ranges from Rs• 50/- to Rs.140/- per Bahr (1300 lbs.) according &amp; their quality. Or in other words a bag of dry dates weighing 162 lbs. produced in Batinah is sold for Rs.6/- where as a bag of dry dates produced in Bharqia or our will cost Rs.12/-. About 21000 tjn.nnn— »d bags of dates have already been exported to India this year and it is estimated that the total export will be 80,000 to 90,000 bags* The value may go down when export from Iraq will begin, inis generally taxes place from the middle of September. \ Food stuff is enough for the consumption of six months although wheat is scanty in the market. But replanishment of wheat is expected by dhows as the season has now commenced. piecegoods are enough in the market for the use of the local people ai.d they are mostly Japanese. *faen the present stock will.be exhausted the merchants will have to order for Indian piecegoods as importation of Japanese piece goods has been stopped. /’/'• l.The oultan has expressed anxiety over the accumulated wealth in his treasury at Gwf:dur which he states now amounts to over 3 lakhs* he J'^ihests that this be brought over to Muscat by any safe hand opport unity.

It is largely comprised of copies of various kinds of financial statements, produced by the Government of Muscat and Oman and forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat.The statements include the following details: budget estimates, estimated revenue and expenditure, and actual revenue and expenditure. Also included are brief statements which provide summaries of the Sultanate's financial position. The volume also features a significant amount of related correspondence, mostly between the Political Agent and the Political Resident but also between the Political Agent and representatives of the Government of Muscat and Oman, namely the Government's Finance Officer and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd]. Other notable correspondents include officials of the Government of India's Finance and Foreign Departments.The correspondence discusses the contents of the statements, as well as other related matters, such as the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's own personal finances, and whether certain items that are currently omitted from the state budget (e.g. the accounts of the Muscat and Dhofar oil concessions) should be included. Also discussed is the possibility of the Sultan investing some of his government's money in Government of India bonds, as proposed by the Political Resident.The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Finance Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Financial statements</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sultanate of Muscat and Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00038b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
