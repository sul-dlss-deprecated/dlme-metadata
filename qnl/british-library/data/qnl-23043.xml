British Agency, Doha, 1st April 1950. / J ht£Lj j On the strength of the last sentence of Jakins^ letter 2669-16/43 of 25th October 1949, I have been paying my bodyguard 10 rupees a month to have coffee always on tap, and have been showing that sum in my Quarterly Accounts. Paterson tells me that this is not a proper charge on my office account, but should be paid for out of the Mission Fund* 2* I may as well wait.Amtil the Department raises a query on the last six months, but for the future, would you approach the Residency about financing my ceremonial dispen sations ? I should be glad to know whether they will wish me to continue at a flat rate as now, or to submit bills for actuals, and if so within what limits. The price of coffee has doubled and of cardamom quadrupled itself since I fixed the present rate six months ago, so I think it due for revision. 3* I have not spent any money on incense, as Salih, in a light-hearted moment gave me some, and the Darwish thereupon followed suit. If it is to be bought in future, it would be better sent from Bahrain, as I am told that it is more expen sive here. I do not use rose-water, as I have no sprinkler, and dislike the stuff intensely. If the Sheikh feels the ommissioh keenly enough, he will no doubt one day present us with a handsome silver sprinkler, - meanwhile I do not worry. C.J. Pelly Es a . OBB., H.M. Political Agent, Bahrain*— COKFIJ^HTIAL . -Accts* Dear Dredge, Political Agency, Bahrain, 13th April,1350. I should be glad to know whether any allocation has been made for the Mission Fund expenses of this post for the current financial year, from Idt April, 1950 to 31st March, 1951. As you know, we have to provide Sharjah with funds also and this year we have the . additional burden of Qatar for which no allowance was made last year. I trust that this will be taken into consideration when making the allotment. Yours ever, A.L.A Dredge Esq., M.3.E., 1st Secretary, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.• w t P-H v'-'k fU-.

We are unable to make any allocation for 1950-51 until we have been granted an over-all allocation by the Foreign Office. Before we apply for this we must have your final quarterly statement of Mission Fund expenditure for the quarter ended March 31st. These certificates and statements should please be sent urgently.cjt-j ( n) t Political Agency, 3*0,No*J3^ -4/60 Bear Wilton, Bahrain, 25th April,1950 # f' No.12/8/50 to Felly regarding Mission Fund. 2. I wrote to Residency on the subject as we ourselves wished to know the allocation. Residency have not yet * heard from the Foreign Office about the j oyer-all amount allotad for this purpose but in the meanwhile they have desired us to send the statement of Mission Fund \ expenditure for March, 1950, Quarter which is now on its way. 3. The usual practice is that Foreign Office makes a certain over-all allotment to Residency towards Mission Fund expendi ture for every Financial Year. Residency allots a portion out of this to Bahrain and its subordinate Posts and Bahrain In turn makes the allocation to the subordinate post or posts. 4* You will be advised about your allo cation as soon as we hear from the Residency in respect of the total allotment for Bahrain and its subordinate posts for the financial year ending 31st March, 1951.

Hartley. L.A.G. Pinhey Esquire, O.B.E., First Secretary, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.Minutes. CD Letter No.12/8/50 dated 1st Aprils &gt;1950 _ from Doha Agency . Correspondence on the subject of Mission Fund is in C.O. According to the procedure, a certain sum is allotted to meet Mission Fund expenditure for this post and the posts under our tta supervision. Out of this sum we will have to allot a portion for Sharjah, and a portion for Doha retaining ofcourse a portion for ourselves. The total allotment, I understand, is made annually for the Financial Year. For the last Financial Year i.e., from 1st April, 1949, to 31st March 1950, the allotment was Rs.2,500/- As regards the current Financial Year, i.e., from 1st April, 1950 to 31st March, 1951, I have no idea as to what has been alloted by the P.R. Perhaps C.O. might have subsequently received some instructions from the Residency. If so, we will have to advice Sharjah as well as Doha amounts alloted by us in turn for their respective posts. If not, we shall have to write to the Residency and find out what they have alloted for the current financial year. Sharjah and Doha should submit to us at the end of each quarter the expenditure incurred by the^during the quarter on account of Mission Fund. We shall know what we have spent for this post. For all these expenses, a consolidated certificate will have to be sent to the Residency together with relevant vouchers wherever possible to obtain. There is a specific form of certificate for this purpose which will have to be used.Nothing to be Written in this MargiMinutes. Letter No.108/31/50 of 19-4-50 from the Residency . We desired to know the allocation for L950-51, as we had to make allocation for :}oha (Vide S.l below), I understand that C.O. is already arranging to submit the Quarterly Statement called for in the P.U.C.
