Dear Sir, [ ^ (/ ) t (5 ) I should like to inform you that Aramco are currently carrying on negotiations with the R.a.JT . at Liuharraq. for the pos sible rental of some of their unused barracks for housing trans ient Aramco employees of American nationality. This matter is merely in the development stage of detennining whether or not such barracks could be made available to Aramco and no commitment has been made either by the R.^.F. or Aramco. Uiis tentative plan to rent the R.^.F. barracks at Muharraq is merely a temporary measure to relieve the acute short age of bachelor housing space in ^rabia for our American employees. Should negotiations reach the point where Aramco could have these barracks on a rental basis, and it is decided to go ahead with the tentative plan of housing from 200 to 300 men at Muharraq, the men would be flown daily from Muharraq to Dhahran and vice versa. I shall keep you informed of any decision reached in this matter so that if it is decided to go ahead with housing these men at Muharraq arrangements can subsequently be worked out as regards control of their movements, liquor privileges, etc. Very truly yours, Arabian American oil company, G.

In effect this has meant that the civil authorities concerned have undertaken to provide civil control and a#radio staff to take over from the R.A.the facilities which they were operating during the war and have continued to oper ate for R .a. F. and civil purposes up to the present. Whereas in some colonies the local government has been able to assume responsibility for the provision of the civil staff&gt; there are certain stations, including those in the Persian Gulf area, where M.C.a . has had to take direct responsibility for the provision of the necessary civil staff. This has been done, in most cases, through the agency of either B.O. a .G . or Internation al Aerad io Ltd. (a Company formed by the three British Airways Corporations to take over, where appropriate, the operation of civil aviation ground services.) The expend iture involved will be a direct charge on M.C.a. Votes and we had therefore to obtain the Treasury^ approval to our proposals. Whilst they were prepared to agree that there was no alternative method of providing the necessary technical staff, they have suggested that in the case of the Persian Gulf Stations, we should discuss witn you the possibility of recovering some part of the cost from the local Shaikhs, This suggestion is based on the assumption, derived from the Chicago Convention, that each Governroent should provide the ground facilities required in its territory for international air navigation. This assumption has been accepted in the case of the Colonies and we are now discussing with the Colonial Governments the division of the cost of providing trunk route facilities in their territories between local and U.K. funds. We are not in a position to say how much oenefit the Shaikhs of Bahrain ana oharjah obtain from the operation of British trunk route services through their territories nor how much it would be reasonable to ask them to contri bute towards the cost. v/e must, therefore, seek your advice on whether we can expect a^y contribution fro/; them, before replying to the treasury. &lt;&lt;e do appreciate, how ever, that as we have to pay for the privilege of operating aerodromes in these territories our chances of obtaining any contributions from the Shaikhs must be very small even if it can be established that they derive considerable benefit from the operation of the services.

WITH THIS COMPLIIISNTS Oi' THE UKDjiR SECRETAHY Oi? STATii FOR GOMKONVVJIULTH RELATIONS. Ext.2168/47. 13th October, 1947. Dear Mi lis, ,/ould you please refer to your letter No .R. 42104/47/ FG2 of the 6th October to Harrison about the cost of pro viding civil control and radio staff at aerodromes in the Persian Gulf? As you are aware the position at Bahrain is that in exchange for exclusive civil aviation rights we make the Shaikh a small lump sum payment. Article 9 of the Banrain Civil Aviation Agreement allows H• L.G• or their agents to retain all landing fees 'in recognition of H.M.G^s expenditure on the aerodrome and of tne consider ation paid to the Shaikh under clause 16'. In our view tne Shaikh has already made a reasonable contribution towards the cost of running the aerodromes in his terri tories, by agreeing to forego landing f^ees. I am unaole to see how we could ask him to go further than this, and even to reverse the understanding on which the Agreement is based (-which is that we pay for our privileged position) without negotiating a fresh agreement. This we certainly do not wish to do, especially as the existing Agreement has over a year to run. In the case of Sharjah, in return for facilities for the operation of services by B .O .A .G., we pay the Shaikh a small personal subsidy together with rent for the air station and rest house, and a landing fee of Rs 5 for every aircraft landing on the aerodrome. In our view it would be wrong to approach the Shaikh for any change in the working of the present agreement before its expiry merely on the grounds that our own arrangements had undergone a change. The Sharjah agreement is due for renewal in July next year and if any change (such as the retention of landing fees by H .M.G, in recognition of the cost of maintaining and staffing the aerodrome) is con templated we feel that this should await the negotiations of a fresh agreement. Pending the comments of the Political Resident, Persian Gulf (to whom I am sending a copy of this corres pondence) I reserve my view whether, when the time comes, there will be any scope for recovering any part of the cost from the local Rulers, but, as you yourselves realise, the prospect of doing so is not very hopeful.

U.O,Ko.1825-3 PERSIA:, GUJ^ 1 R^siLiCiCY, 3aJ:irain, the 2l3t October, 1947. Dear Donaloson, &lt; Please refer to the papers forwarded v.i th Commonwealth Relations Office endorsement No.Iixt.2168/47 dated the 13th October, 1947 , about tlrie cost of proviaing civil control and radio staff at aerodromes in the Persian Gulf . 2. The position in the Gulf is that with considerable difficulty we have succeeded in bribing some of the Rulers to allow us to develop and maintain land ing-grounds or flying-boat bases in order to establish control over air communications in this part of the world. There is a possibility that when we renew existing agreements we may have to pay more than we did before arid it is out of the question to ask the otates to contribute. incidentally the Jtates concerned derive little or no benefit from the air services which use their landing grounds or flying-, boat oases. 6o far as 1 am aware there is no service which picks up and sets down passengers at 3harjah while at Bahrain there are two services between the united Kingdom and Bahrain which are reserved for oil personnel and a number of through services to the -tf'ar iiJast and Australia which do not cater at all for local traffic. There is at present one shuttle flying-boat service per week between Bahrain and Karachi which is availaole ^ to the local public Is t .November. but that is being taken off from the 3.

'They are exist and possibly some obtained from them that they will provide civil control and radio staff if the air agreement with the Shaikh is renewed, but I do not think we can call upon the Shaikh to meet the cost of this unless he himself presses for the development of the landing ground as a designated one and services are arranged which can be utilised by the State and its subjects.

Dear Wing Commander Cunliffe, You will remember that I spoke to you some days ago about present arrangements for the maintenance of Muharraq airfield at Bahrain; I understood from you that this aerodrome is currently being maintained by the R.A.F. and that, subject to any alteration in plans because of political or other factors, it'was probable that you would wish to keep an aerodrome there of approximately the present standards. 2. I now enclose a letter which we have received from B.O.A.C. from which you will see that they do not consider the traffic offering at Bahrain warrants the construction of a first class airfield there and they request an assurance that the^ existing aerodrome will be kept .serviceable in accordance with J its present classification. We should accordingly be grateful if the Air Ministry would undertake to inform us immediately if any change is contemplated in the present R.A.F. policy towards Muharraq in order that we may feive consideration to possible alternative arrangements. * 3.

Sir, Bahrain Aerodrome I am instructed to advise you that we have given close consideration to our possible long term requirements for land plane services at the above aerodrome, and I am to request that your Ministry will take appropriate action to ensure that the existing land plane aerodrome be kept serviceable in accordance with its present classification. 2. It is not considered that the traffic petential would warrant the heavy expenditure required to bring it to the status of a first-class airfield. When our flying hotts services are eventually withdrawn, feeder services will be sufficient to deal with the traffic requirements of the area. 3.
