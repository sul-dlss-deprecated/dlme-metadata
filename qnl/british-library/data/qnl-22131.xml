No. q 50 - of 1364 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 24th j/Awal, 1364 May 6, 1945. H. B. M’s political Agent, Bahrain. . ^ Memorandum:- The Superintendent of the Public tforks Dep’t, Agha Mohamed Jafar who has held this post for about seven years proceeded on five months’ leave to India on 31st May 1944. He was granted an extension of three weeks and was paid his return air passage in advance. He has not returned. During this long period I have received several letters and telegrams from him, some of th^m in answer to my enquiries as to the cause of his delay in return ing to Bahrain. The reasons given were on the whole unsatisfactory and his final letter,, received by n%. ^ a few days ago, implies that he does not propose to return unless he is granted an increment -of fo. 100/- per month. He is now on the scale of Rs. 500/- per month, basic pay, and together with allowances he earns Rs. 625/- per month. In June last year Mohamed Jafar received the honour of Khan Sahib in the Birthday Honours. Mohamed Jafar is an old man and, I believe, in very comfortable circumstances. During his time in Bahrain he did good work. If when he went on leave he had told me that he wished to retire his resignation would have been accepted and we should have taken steps to fill his place. I consider however that he has behaved badly by neither returning to work in Bahrain or resigning his post. Under the circumstances I now^ feel compelled to infoim him that his services are terminated owing to his continued absence without leave. He has R5.3,40l/- in his Provident Fund representing his own and the Government’s contributions. Owing to^ the way in which he has behaved I propose to pay to him only his own contribution to this fund, deducting from it the cost of his passage back to Bahrain which was paid in advance, and the rent of his house which I understand has not been paid since he left. In view of the fact that he was made a Khan Sahib last year, on the recommendation of the Political Agent, and that he draws a pension from the Government of India I should be grateful for your views on the case before I take any action.

But, except for the deductions you mention, his house rent and his passage money to Bahrain, I do not think you should withhold from him any part of his provident Fund. This, after all, is an investment carrying with it the promise, explicit or implicit, of payment of the whole amount contributed at the end of service, whatever has been the conduct of the employee. If this promise did not exist doubtless many Government servants would wish to invest their savings in some n&gt;ther way. 2 You seem fully justified in informing Agent, Bahrain.Ho. /66T —^5' of 1364 Office of the-Adviser to the Govornnent, Baiirain Dated, Ranadhan 28, September 5, 1945. In connection with the vacancy for a Suptt., P.W.D. , I enclose two replies to the Bahia in Government's advertisement which are the only responses that appear to be suitable. Letters are still coming in but most of them are from persons without sufficient qualifications. Would it be possible to obtain any confidential information regarding the two applicants from Government of India sourcesP Captain Basant Singh asks the maximum pay mentioned and from his apparent qualifications I consider that he would be worth that amount. I should be grateful for your advise in this matter. I enclose the two applications and should be obliged if you would return them. Memo randun:- H. B # M's Political Agent, Bahrain.
