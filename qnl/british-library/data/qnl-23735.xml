In the Department of Education^ notification No. F.77-13/33-B, dated 1st February, 1934, to which attention is drawn, the milieu for language study of the Russian language for the purposes of the Interpretership Examination is laid down as the 'Baltic States'. This, however, would appear to be incorrect in the light of recent geo-political changes in Europe, and it is requested that the Department of Education may be asked to clarify the terms laid down for the study of the Russian language abroad after having paid due consideration to the changed conditions brought about by the war.
