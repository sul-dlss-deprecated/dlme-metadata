Copy No. 8 THE SITUATION IN TURKEY, 15th MARCH, 1920. PART. I—INFORMATION. 1. General Factors. («•) Political. —Political power has passed to the Nationalists. Despite sporadic opposition owing to requisitions and the fact that thteir forces are nominally controlled and administered from Constantinople, the Nationalist organization will soon be, if it is not already, sufficiently complete to function independently. {b.) Moral .—The mass of the nation is absolutely war-weary. But the population would be prepared to fight bitterly to avoid parts of their territory or own landed property being handed over to a foreign power, especially to Greece or Armenia, it is doubtful, however, how many volunteers could be raised, say, in Aidin to fight in Erzerum or vice versa, i.e., resistance will probably be local, except in the case of regular troops. (c.) Material Factors — (i.) Personnel. —The Turkish Regular forces would almost certainly place themselves at the disposal of the Nationalists. (ii.) Material. —The Regular forces are well armed, well fed, and in most cases—at least until recently—were regularly paid for the first time on record and fairly equipped. The supply of rifles and small-arm ammunition is sufficient to maintain both Regulars and Nationalists for 3 to 6 months. They are not well off for mobile artillery nor shells. But they have sufficient of these, mostly in the eastern districts, to enable them to operate against lightly equipped opponents. (iii.) Communications.—The telegraph system is very fair. Communications east and west are good, including the main Europe—Asia lines :— (a.) Along south of Black Sea. {b.) Through Sivas and Diarbekr. (c.) Through Konia and Aleppo. Lines north and south are very few in number, especially in the central area. Wireless .—The Turks only appear to have four sets—all light portable, with radius of not much more than 100 miles in this terrain. These have been recently located near— Erzerum. Van. Kara Kilisseh. Bayazid (believed to have moved to near Erzerum). (iv.) Transport. — Railways. —The Angora Railway is run by Turkish personnel. The Anatolian and others to a considerable extent by Europeans. In the absence of Europeans a breakdown in engine power is almost inevitable. There is a serious shortage of spare parts. In the absence of English coal inferior coal brought from Eregli by sea is used. If this were stopped and wood were the only fuel available, engines would soon be brought to a standstill. However the Nationalists would not be dependent upon the railway in the ordinary military sense. Mechanical transport is practically non-existent. Metalled roads ire few and not in good repair. Pack .—Great shortage of horses and mules. {d.) Military control and organization. (See Appendix D.)—The Nationalist Organization is now sufficiently established to be able to exercise efficient control from Angora, Sivas or Erzerum. On the withdrawal of Allied troops from Konia, that too could be made available as a base. The occupation by the Allies of the War Office at Constantinople may therefore not have much effect from the point of view of military control. (See paragraph 1 above.) (B20/139) 50 3/20 H&amp;S S061wo(e.) Extent of Nationalist movement. —This derives its strength from fear of permanent occupation by Christian powers, or where Armenian or European troops have been suspected of oppressive action ; i.e.,* Smyrna, Thrace and Cilicia. Kesistance will increase with the depth of the zone occupied. (f) Neighbouring peoples. — Arabs. —The Arabs generally sympathise with their co-religionists, the Turks. The Damascus Government is in touch with the Nationalists, and the Arab Government officials are mostly in sympathy with pan- Islam. But it seems very unlikely that any large number of Arabs would take part in any operations outside their own country, even for an attack on Cilicia, Syria or the Euphrates. I he Arabs strategy will most probably take the form of synchronized and self-interested operations calculated to take advantage of any Turkish diversion. A?mZs.—Ieeling in Kurdistan is divided. There is no doubt that the Turks are intriguing^ with the Kurds. The latter may respect the Caliphate, but there is a strong paity desiring an independent Kurdistan. Any decision tending to split Kurdistan between I ranee and England might throw this party into the arms of the pro-Turk pa! ty. It is not considered, however, that the Kurds would be prepared to take action much outside their own areas, and in the main they are said to desire independence of the Turks. Azerbaijan. Has been flirting with the Soviet, and decidedly with the Turks. Though Shiahs, the Tartars are co-religiooist and, owing their independence from Bussia m the first instance to lurkish assistance, they are favourable to Turkey. They are now however, on good terms with Georgia, on whose good offices, for transit, &amp;c., they are dependent. They appear to be making honest attempts at an understanding with _imenia, despite the chronic animosity between these peoples. De facto recognition bv His Majesty s Government has done good, however, and if the proposed Allied support with equipment and arms is judiciously arranged, it is not considered that there is tor the moment, much danger of Azerbaijan directly assisting the Turks. Thanks, however to Armenian intransigeance the Tartars may always he reckoned upon to piovide a diversion calculated to hold the Erivan Armenian forces away from the I urks. J 2. Psychological and Sentimental. (g.) The importance in the Moslem mind of the retention of Constantinople is not easy to determine. It must be remembered that over 200,000 of the Mohammedan population of Constantinople are not Turks. It is certain that owing to propaganda or otherwise the question bulks large in India ; and is a factor of some weight in Egypt where there is an important Turkish element^ among the notables. In Arabia, Afghanistan, Mesopotamia, Syria and Azerbaijan, it may be said to have little influence on the masses of the people, though the question will always be used as a political weapon when required by their leaders and spokesmen. But m Anatolia and Kurdistan, where it might be expected to be of supreme importance, it seems doubtful if it is really vital. In short, it is useful as a rallying cry, as propaganda, and as a stalking-horse in foreign politics. But it is doubtful v letber the presence of the Greek in Smyrna and the threatened creation of Armenia do pot loom larger in the Turkish Nationalist eye, while the introduction of a hristian wedge into Cilicia, threatening to sever Turk from Arab, has had immediate local results. (6.) Another fundamental matter s the great change which has been influencing the nature of popular movements m Asia during the last 15 years, owing to the success of Japan. In the past it has always been religion that has moved the East. Now, with the improvement of communications and greater frequence of intercourse, familiarity with Europeans and their methods has inevitably bred contempt, or, at least, a practical perspective. W hether the Easterner believes more in himself or less in the European it would appear that the dominating factor of the future is nationality. The international agitator is quick to manipulate this factor, as is seen in Egypt, where Copt and Muslims Vio ill vehemence; m India, where Hindu shows an inclination to common cause with Mohammedan: in Palestine, where anti-Zionists work to combine Christian and Arab against the Jew. The Arab rising o the (Minh’c f ~ ^as Nationalist, not religious, and was, indeed, directed against the Cahph s forces. The Young Turk revolution of 1908 and the Persian movement of 1906 were Nationalist. T , Present movement in Turkey is definitely Nationalist and not religious though the weight of rehg.ous and quasi-religious factors will decrease and the weight3 of territorial considerations will increase in proportion to the strength of Nationalism, yet religion will always be the instrument of Nationalism. Thus, Turkish Nationalists have not yet abandoned their position in Thrace, for which purpose they make play with the religious associations of Adrianople. The manipulation of the Caliphate question calls for no comment here. 3. Characteristics. The Turk is an excellent fighter individually, especially on the defensive. The regular troops are well officered and sufficiently well organized to be mobile and self- supporting. The Nationalist bands are men with rifles, some ammunition and no transport, though their personal mobility is said to be remarkable. They are believed mainly to comprise men who have registered their names and then returned to their homes. Their activities are therefore limited practically by the distance away from their own homes that they can be fed. They have machine-guns and some artillery. 4. Possible courses open to Nationalists and forces available. These will be considered together as, owing to factors given above (localization of Nationalist bands, lack of communications, financial difficulties, &amp;c.) the force available vary with the course proposed. (a.) Attack on Greek population in Thrace, possibly accompanied by outbreaks in Constantinople. (/&gt;.) Attack Greeks in Smyrna area. (c.) Attack French in Cilicia. [d.) Attack Armenia. (e.) Attack Mesopotamia. (/.) General defensive and waiting game, meanvffiile harrassing by guerilla methods such Allied detachments as may be left exposed and attacking Christian populations. 5 5. Thrace and Constantinople {vide map attached). (1.) Western Thrace (region between the Kiver Mesta and River Maritsa).—In effective occupation of the Allies. Troops available— (1.) Xanthi district— 9th Greek Division (less 2 infantry regiments, 3,500 rifles). (2.) Gumuljina, River Maritsa— French—-3 battalions (3,500 rifles), 3 squadrons, 1 battery. Italian—1 company at Ferejic. (2.) Eastern Thrace (Adrianople Vilayet) from the River Maritsa on the west to the Chatalja Lines on the east— Turks, Regular—2,500 rifles. Nationalist irregular bands.—Estimated at 30,000 rifles roughly organized with proportion of trained officers. Allied.—One Greek battalion on Constantinople—Demotika railway (1,200 rifles). Two French squadrons just south of Adrianople. 75 per cent, of the population of Eastern Thrace are Moslems. The bulk of the Moslem civil population has been armed, with a view to resisting Greek annexation. The Christian villagers are armed to a lesser extent than the Moslems. The Greek Government, wffiile believed to be confident as to their ability to take over the whole of Thrace, has lately expressed some anxiety about the exposed situation of the Greek battalion, strung out in detachments along the Constantinople—Demotika railway. (3.) Constantinople area (east of the Chatalja Lines)— Turks, Regular—3,300 rifles. Irregular (in case of a general rising)—20,000 rifles. Allied, Land—24,000 rifles. Sea—Allied fleets. (4.) Without attacking Constantinople, there seems to be little reason why the Turks should not take practically uninterrupted measures to eliminate the Christian population between the River Maritsa and the Chatalja Lines, unless joint action is taken by the Allies, vide Part II. 3 (a).

Factors against— (a.) Dispersal of force. {b.) Unreliability of tribal assistance. (c.) Well organized arrangements of British in Mesopotamia. {d.) Unlikelihood of great results even if locally successful. 10. Passive resistance, combined with Guerilla tactics. This seems far the most likely military policy for the Nationalists to adopt. The Allies would find it difficult to deploy from the few seaports and their immediate hinterlands. Any forward movement or any attempt at intercommunication by land would be very costly. Unrest and raiding in the north of Mesopotamia, both by Arabs and Kurds, and in Syria, Cilicia and Palestine can be assisted and encouraged, thus throwing great strain on the administration and precluding the reduction of garrisons as well as immobilizing them. All this can be done without any great expenditure of money or munitions on the part of the Turks. Deprivation of imports from Europe would afiect them less almost than any other country, except perhaps in the matter of piece goods. Munitions they have methods of obtaining, and in the matter of food they are self-supporting. Any serious retaliatory advances by the Allies into the mountains would require highly organized and costly operations necessitating road-making, and would be a very slow business. The Nationalists may therefore hope, by following a Fabian policy and by active propaganda in neighbouring countries, to make the financial burden of policing and defending their new acquisitions intolerable to the Allies, and thus to cause either their partial withdrawal or an offer of more favourable terms as a compromise—in other words to cease their interference. Time is on the side of Mustapha Kemal. 11. To recapitulate the above. The soundest course for Mustapha Kemal to take, from his own point of view, will be to leave as many Nationalists as possible to work on their farms while concentrating, as soon as weather conditions permit, sufficient of his followers in order to:— (a.) Preclude any deep advance by the Greeks into Anatolia. (b.) Attack any outlying Allied detachments. This will include an attempt to regain control of the Anatolian Railway with a view to blockading Constantinople for food supplies. (c.) Watch the Russian—Armenian frontier. (d.) Oppose any Allied landing, other than in serious strength at Trebizond. (e.) Co-operate with Arabs against the British on the Euphrates. (/.) Bolster up opposition to the French in Cilicia. At the same time anti-Greek outbreaks may be expected in Thrace. Mustapha Kemal’s course would then be to await the moment when the economic position and general political situation amongst the Allies precludes any direct interference in his country. The position is one which can be dealt with politically more effectively than by military measures on the part of the Allies. If it is to be dealt with militarily, protracted operations by full}? equipped armies must be prepared for.7 PART II.—OPERATIONS. 1. Summary of Certain Provisions in the Treaty. The Treaty of Peace with Turkey, as provisionally approved by the Supreme Council, contains certain conditions which the Turks are most unlikely to accept, and which, therefore, cannot be carried into effect unless the Allies are prepared to take military measures to enforce them. The most prominent of these provisions are tne following:— (a.) The transfer to Greek sovereignty of the whole of European Turkey, less the area south of either the Enos—Midia or Chatalja lines as the Allied Powers may decide, and it is understood that the latter is the more probable decision. (b.) The practical cession of the Sanjak of Smyrna to Greece. (c.) The renunciation in favour of the Allied Powers of all the Turkish rights and titles over Kurdistan. (d.) The recognition of Armenia as an independent State, the area of which is to be roughly as follows :—• On the east, the Turko—Persian frontier. On the south, the northern boundary of Kurdistan, that is to say, a line running approximately east and west, just south of Lake A an. On the west, a line running approximately due south from Surmena to Hatabdagh, thence to Bag Hirdagh, thence to Musa and Bitlis, inclusive. (e.) The constitution of a demilitarized area lying between Irebizond and Erzinjan with an average width of 40 miles. In addition to the above, Turkey has also to renounce all her rights over Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and Arabia, but these clauses of the Treaty present, no particular military difficulty as Turkey has already lost control over them. 2. Probable Action of the Turks. It may be confidently expected that Turkey will offer the utmost measure of No.‘ill resistance to the conditions enumerated in paragraph 1, and in this connection the lO.o.io British High Commissioner, in a telegram dated the 10th of March, pointed out that the probable consequence of presenting a Treaty of such severity would be as follows :— (a.) A refusal on the part of Turkey to sign the Treaty, or, if signed, to ratify it, or. if ratified, to execute it. {b.) A general rising, involving the abdication or deportation of the Sultan, the flight of the Parliament to Anatolia, the accession of a new Multan and the creation of a new Government in Asia Minor, accompanied by wide-spread massacres of Christians both in Asia Minor and Thrace. (c.) Attempts at concerted action in Europe between the Turks and Bulgarians against the Greeks. (d.) The possibility of combined action in Asia between the Turks, the Arabs and the Bolsheviks. 3. Joint Action by the Allies. The joint action which the Allies could take in order to coerce the Turks into complying with the terms of the Treaty are as follows :— (a.) In Thrace the French troops under General Franchet d’Esperey, assisted by such forces as could be furnished by Greece, should be able to maintain order and prevent the wholesale massacre of Christians. (b.) In the Sanjak of Smyrna the Greek forces amounting to some 6 divisions might push forward in order to occupy the Anatolian Railway between Konia and Eskishehr. It must be pointed out, however, that such an operation holds no definite promise of decisive result, and may entail the maintenance of a large Greek force in this area for an indefinite period, and if Greece is to take over Thrace as well as Smyrna, it is unlikely that she can afford to maintain such a force for long. It must also be pointed out that any military reverse which the Greeks may receive will immediately affect Allied prestige and will encourage Turkish outbreaks in regions where England and France are more directly concerned.8 (c.) In Cilicia the French might possibly advance from Marash into the interior, but it is difficult to point to any objective within reasonable distance the attainment of which would have any considerable influence in coercing the Turks to comply with the Treaty. Moreover, at present the French forces in Cilicia and Syria have enough to do to keep the zone they now occupy under control, and it would be necessary to reinforce the existing garrison by two or three French divisions before they would be in a position to carry out such an advance. It is understood, however, that the brench military authorities have stated definitely that it would be quite impossible for them to undertake any advance into the interior. (d.) In the Aidin Vilayet the Italians are not likely to give much assistance in any operations against the Turks, indeed the whole trend of their policy has been rather less than loyal to the Allies. The Italian force here is on very bad terms with the neighbouring Greek troops, and would never work in concert with them. Furthermore, the Italians failed to provide a force to relieve us in the Caucasus, and they would find it much harder to despatch an expeditionary force now. (e.) In the Constantinople area the British Army of the Black Sea is now reduced to the strength of one division (apart from the detachment at Batoum), and will be fully employed keeping order in Constantinople itself, and ensuring the freedom of the Straits. (/.) In Kurdistar. —As regards Kurdistan it is impossible to foresee what difficulties may arise in giving effect to the Provision of the Treaty which concerns this province, as the attitude of the Kurds themselves is uncertain, but it is clear that the Allied Powers are not in a position f^o make any military intervention on the spot, and they must rely therefore on the pressure they can exert at Constantinople and elsewhere. (g.) Armenia. Of all the conditions of the Treaty, however, the one which will arouse the greatest opposition among the Turks and which will be the hardest to enforce is that under which a large area of Turkey in Asia is to be handed over to Armenia. The proposed boundaries of Armenia will include the Turkish stronghold of Erzerum and Turkish territory for a distance of from 60—80 miles west of this place. It can hardly be anticipated that the Turks will be willing to evacuate these regions without any remonstrance and compulsion of some kind will be necessary. The Armenian Army comprises some 20,000 men with 36 mountain guns. The Turkish forces in the area Erzerum—Sivas—Trebizond amount to 10,000 regulars and 18,500 irregulars, a total of 28,500, with a considerable quantity of heavy and light artillery. In addition to the above it is more than probable that they would collect reinforcements for other fronts, i.e., Marash, Eskishehr and possibly the Aidiu Vilayet, so that they might well be able to concentrate a force of close on 40,000 men in this area. The maintenance and supply of a force of this strength should not present any serious difficulties, as the neighbouring country is rich and sufficient supplies are obtainable. On the other hand, the fighting quality of the Armenian Army is by no means high and, with the numbers at its disposal, it would be unable to take the ofiensive against the r Iurks, even if it were feasible to utilize the whole of the available fighting troops and none were required to watch the Azerbaijan frontier. Moreover, the extent of front from the Black Sea to Lake Van, which would require guarding, is close on 300 miles, a task quite beyond the capacity of*the forces at the disposal of the Armenian Government. Consequently if the new territory is to be handed over to Armenia the direct military assistance of the Allies will be needed. External pressure, whether economic or otherwise, will not avail in a country like Asia Minor, which is self supporting and where the inhabitants are not very sensitive to the effects produced by a blockade or the restriction of commerce. V ith the exception of the route from the railhead at Sarikamish, itself almost as distant from. Erzerum and the probable theatre of operations as Trebizond, and impracticable owing to the hopelessly indifferent condition of the 400 miles of railwav from Batoum, there is only one possible means for troops to reach Erzerum from the sea and that is by the road from Trebizond, vid Gumushkhane and Baiburt, a distance of 106 miles.5 ) 9 For nearly 100 miles tins chaussee runs in a defile liable to obstruction by landslips and floods and with scarcely any space for encamping troops or room for carts to pass'. The country on either hand is traversed only by rough mule tracks, with rhe single exception of the Erzingan Road which branches off at Tebka. Gradients of 1 in 10 have to be negotiated, and the passes reach a height of 8,200 feet. I rebizond is^an open roadstead and is at the mercy of the prevailing wind from the north-west. Two adjacent ports at Platana and Kovata are more sheltered and would be used in conjunction with Trebizond, but at none of these places can ocean-going vessels come alongside, and a landing can only be effected by meins of small boats. The Russians in 1916 employed a force of approximately double the lurkish strength in their operations against Erzerum, and they advanced overland from Kars. Consequently, even allowing for the superiority of the Allied troops, a force at least equal to the available Turkish Army would be required, exclusive of such numbers as w r ould be necessary for the lines, of communication, and these would have to be considerable in view of the guerilla warfare which would certainly attend operations in a country which is predominantly Turkish. Assuming, therefore, that in the Erzerum area the Turks can dispose of some 40,000 combatants, we should have to be prepared to place a like number in the field, together with the necessary lines of communication and ancillary troops. . . . This would entail the provision of at least two divisions with another division to protect the lines of communication, and a vast organization of mechanical, horse Snd pack transport which would be essential for the maintenance of a force operating under such conditions. Furthermore, before operations could commence, the Trebizond— Erzerum road would require to be remade to take mechanical transport, an immense undertaking considering the distance and the grades. Even supposing this could be carried out, it would hardly be feasible to maintain and supply an army of three divisions, at such a distance from its base by one single road with no alternative means of communication. The seizure of Erzerum would not in itself suffice, the adjacent country would require to be occupied and troops pushed up to the new Turco- Armenian frontier (300 miles in extent). The resulting operations would partake of the nature of guerilla warfare, which is a method of fighting above all things to be avoided. The whole spirit of the art of conducting small wars is to strive for the attainment of decisive methods, the very essence of partisan warfare from the point of view of the enemy being to avoid definite engagements. Consequently, it usually happens that many more men are required than^were originally estimated, and that warfare of this nature continues for years as was the case in the operations of the Dutch in Achin, of the French against Abd el Kadir in Algeria, and the Spaniards in Cuba and Morocco. The provision of the necessar)'shipping to transport and maintain an expeditionary force of this size is an important factor which affects the problem and further adds to t he difficulties of forcing the Turks to hand over these regions to Armenia. The arguments put forward in the above paragraph apply also to the proposal to demilitarize the zone east of the line Tireboli—Kamakh. Military measures to enforce these terms will be required and after occupying Erzerum and establishing the Armenians in their new territory it would be necessary to take possession of Erzingan and other adjoining centres so as to enforce the military evacuation of the 1 rebizond Hinterland. In addition to the above the Allies would probably be compelled to maintain a force in this zone for some time to come to prevent it being re-occupied by Turkish troops. 4. Situation as Regards British Military Resources. The General Staff cannot point to any sources from which the necessary expeditionary force for Armenia can be found. It is not feasible to reduce the present garrisons in Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt, or on the Rhine. There remain, therefore, only the troops in England and Ireland, the strength of which is as follows Ireland ... ... ... ... ••• 28 battalions. England 49 battalions. As regards Ireland the condition of affairs there is such that extra battalions are at present being sent to Tnake the effective infantry strength up to 25,000, which the Commander-in-Chief considers an absolute minimum for safety. In England, owing to the possibility of industrial unrest, the forces are already dangerously low, and it would only be possible to find a few battalions for service abroad. ( 8061 ) E10 Furthermore, the men of these battalions are nearly all raw recruits, and the units are at present quite unsuited to take part in active operations. For the above reasons it w r ould be quite impossible to provide the necessary technical personnel, e.g., mechanical transport drivers and particularly signals, of which our present garrisons are dangerously deficient, and which are essential for an expedition of this nature. In short, the military assets of England are barely sufficient, if even they are sufficient, for the needs of the British Empire, and beyond our present effort in Batoum, Constantinople and the Straits, Palestine, Egypt and Mesopotamia, nothing more can be done with the forces at our disposal. 5. The Possibility of an Outbreak of Atrocities. There is one very serious objection to any renewal of military operations in Asia Minor, and that is that they are bound to be followed by massacres of non-combatants on a very serious scale. If Turkish resentment is really aroused, as it will be by a Greek advance towards the Anatolian Railway, the Turks will certainly murder the defenceless Armenians and other Christians still remaining in Anatolia. It is almost equally certain that the Greeks and Armenians will massacre unoffendin£ Moslems on a similar scale, and it will be out of the power of the Allies to prevent this useless bloodshed once it starts. « 6. Effect on other Moslem Races. It is unnecessary to recapitulate in detail the effect which the severity of the proposed peace conditions may produce amongst the Mahomedan population of other portions of the British Empire ; it will suffice here to say that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine and Mesopotamia and the Mahomedan portion of the Indian population will certainly not receive the news with indifference, and though a serious outbreak may be avoided, it must nevertheless be expected that our difficulties in controlling the Mahomedan areas of the Empire will bear a direct relation to the severity of the terms of the Treaty with Turkey. It seems, therefore, politic to consider very carefully what advantages are likely to accrue to us from terms of such severity before we resold to them. i 7. Conclusion. From a military standpoint it is undesirable that any conditions should he embodied in the Peace Treaty which the Allies are not prepared to enforce. In the preceding paragraphs an endeavour has been made to show what the enforcement of some of the conditions will entail. It may be that the Supreme Council prefer to include all these terms on the chance of Turkey observing them and with no intention of enforcing them if she dosn’t. In this case military opinion on such a policy is probably not desired. It must, however, be pointed out that the conditions of the Treaty contain little promise of bringing peace to a country which is sorely in need of peace ; nor do they, from a military point of view, bring anything but added anxiety and responsibility to all entrusted with the defence of those portions of the British Empire which are linked either by territorial or religious affinities, to what was once the Turkish Empire. General Staff, War Office. \bth March, 1920.14 APPENDIX D.

I he line at present held by the Nationalist Forces in Anatolia does not in its general features conform with the line laid down by General Headquarters. 2. liom Nazili on the south to Kara Agach on the north-west it is divided into six sectors, each under tiie command of a Nationalist leader. Appended is a map showing— ('/.) I he approximate line at present held by the Nationalist F’orces, as indicated by the various commanders of the sectors. (b.) The various sectors, numbered 1 to 6. (c.) r l he Nationalist leader in command of the sector. (d.) Ihe Regular or ex-Regular officer associated with the Nationalst leader. (c.) Headquarters of the sector commander. J. With the exception of Kemal Hey, i/c Soma sector, and himself, a retired cavalry officer who saw considerable service during the war, none of the sector commanders have had any previous military experience. In e\ ery case they have joined the Nationalist Forces since the occupation of Smyrna by the iree's. in any case, they are men of substance or position—some of them possess quite considerable \\ ealth toi w Inch reason, and with a view to their ability to finance and support the tr.iops in their Command, they appear to have been selected. 4. Their lack of military experience is compensated for bv the provision of a Regular or ex-Regular officer in each sector, who occupies a position either as second in command to the Nationalist leader, or as nominally m command of Regular troops in that sector, but actually as military adviser to the Nationalist leader there. A Generally, the firing line may be said to be held by the Nationalist Forces, while the Regular troops piowde the supports, the liaison between the two being very close on all parts of the line. In some sectors, «.y., the fSalikhh and the Akhissar fronts, it is extremely difficult, almost impossible, to differentiate between the Nationalist and Regular troops. Many of the rank and file of the Nationalists, in the above sectors particularly, are disbanded soldiers still wearing their uniforms, -while others are clad in second-hand uniforms bought by the Nationalist leaders. 6. A large number of volunteers to the Nationalist forces, and probably their best material, is furnished by refugees fiom the districts occupied by the Greeks. These have joined either as the readiest means of obtaining a livelihood, or with the hope of having revenge upon the Greeks for injuries sustained durino- and since the occupation of Smyrna, and an appreciable number of Ottoman Greeks are said to be included amono- these refugees. ° veiy thorough system of registration is also in force, to which every man between 20 and 4o years m the district is subject, though he is not necessarily called upon for military service until occasion arises. . '''• 1' iere is nothing like a continuous line on the Nationalist front, nor any indication of wire. The writer was only allowed to see one machine-gun post which was manned by Regular troops, and was shown no ai tnlery positions, the obvious assumption being that these, like the machine-gun post seen, were provided .n the Regular troops. Ihe general scheme seems to be to hold all the villages in the line with small sentry posts. J 9. Lhe villagers, who were all armed, pursued their normal occupation during the day and, in the event of an alarm, were to be immediately called out. Contact is kept by means of mounted patrols, while each headquarters is well served by telephone, and a reserve of both infantry and mounted troops is held at the local headquarters. 10. 1 he supply of both rifles and ammunition is said to be ample, though this appears doubtful, as at least two men were seen in the guard which paraded at Kara Agach armed with unmistakeable shot guns. 11. Of rifles, Iurkish, Russian, Austrian, German, Greek and English patterns are all in use, many of t.iem, however, being dated as far back as 1910, and most of them probably being worn and very inaccurate. 0 J 12. Judging by the amount of ammunition carried by the men and the free use made of it in practice the supply should be good. r lhe smallest quantity carried R 150 rounds, and many men carry up to 350. lb. Ihe physique of the troops on the whole is good, while their activity and endurance are surprising. !4. A small mounted force (figures were unobtainable) is employed in patrolling, and is held in reserve for rapid reinforcing. It is armed in precisely the same way as is the infantry. 15. Ihe horses are mostly of the small Anatolian breed, though a strain of Arab blood is found among some. Notwithstanding their needy appearance, they carry up to 12 or 13 stone on a 10 or 12 hours journey across the mountains, usually without any food except what they can pick up on the way. lb. As mounted infantry these troops should be very useful, not only from the rapidity with which they move, but also from their general good average of marksmanship. The men generally bring in their own horses, many being bred by them. Where the men have not gothcrses, these are supplied by the Nationalist E ront Commander. 1/. Supplies are provided locally, each Front Commander making his own arrangements. These supplies are usually drawn from the district immediately in rear of the front, regular transport as well as country carts being used to bring them up to the line. A tithe, payable either in money or kind, is levied by the Rationalists on all the inhabitants. Ihe bread supplied to the tn ops is always good, ami everywhere better than the black bread used by the villagers. In some sectors a very palatable bread is made of 80 per cent, wheat flour mixed with 20 per cent, maize meal. Some of the sectors have taken over local mills for this purpose; while all have their local bakeries. Foodstuffs are said to be in good supply generally the local harvests having been a fair to good average : while there are large herds of cattle, sheep and goats in all the districts in rear of the line. &amp;15 18. The clothing of the troops varies in each sector, arrangements for this necessary being made locally, is in the case of food. In the Salikhli sector a very useful grey palerine, made in a factory at Lshak, is issued to the men. lu the Akhissar sector, secondhand uniforms are bought and re-issued. In others no attempt at uniformity is made, the men wearing their native costume. In this connection it is noticeable that the standard of discioline in the troops fluctuates along the same line as the standard of clothing, it was appreciably highest on the Salikhli and Akhissar fronts, and lowest in the Dushme sector. It must, however, be noted that the type of man on the Dushnie front was of a much more lawless and turbu ent character than were the men of the valleys of Salikhli and Akhissar. _ 19. The feeling all along the line is extremely bitter about the occupation by the Greeks, ana t le determination to oppose it to the last is practically unanimous. In t le event of the Greeks being authorized under the terms of peace to retain Smyrna, the Nationalists will p - obably carry out their tin eats to attac them. . ..... 20. The countr7 at the moment is practically in a state of revolution, while the mountain districts m leai of Smyrna have never come wholly even under Ottoman rule, and have always been a centre of lawlessness and brigandage. Further into the interior little support to the movement may be expected, for the natives there are more remote from ttie scene of the Greek occupation, are wearied by years of wai, burdened &gt;y t le Nationalist levies imposed in addition to Government taxes, and are generally only desirous of being left in peace to pursue their normal avocations. , 21. That the Nationalist Turks could engage in a successful war against the Greeks, even unsupported by the Great Powers, is unthinkable. Their rifles are of every European variety; their ammunition must be limited—and for some patterns very limited—and they are not in possession of munition lactones to renew their stocks when these are exhausted. Hut a boycott of Smyrna, which is everywhere discussed combined with a long guerilla warfare, in which railway bridges would be destroyed, communications cut and small parties of Greeks ambushed and captured seems quite possible. . 22. The Greeks are strange to the country; the Nationalist Turks are familiar with every mountain track and pass. The Turks would have little difficulty in sending quite considerable bodies of infantry, and even mounted troops, round the flanks of the Greek positions, without detection, by even low-flying aeroplanes. The country is an extremely difficult one for successful aeroplane reconnaissance, both from the difficulty of flying among the mountains, and owing to the nature of the terrain, much o. whicn is woodlam , while the valleys in many cases are deep and rocky, and would afford perfect cover to raiding parties. 23 It would be a long and expensive war for Greece, even were she successful; and the question ot In r ultimate success seems doubtful. In any case the tactics suggested bv the present Nationalist leaders are practically the same as those adopted by their forefathers when they drove the Greeks fiom Nicaea old vears ago : and it is possible that they have not forgotten this , T .. , 24. In the event of Smyrna being occupied by Allied troops—English, French or even Italian a aige proportion of the Nationalist troops would undoubtedly lay down their arms. This would, however, hardly apply to the entire force, an appreciable percentage of which is obviously composed of men who have never been amenable to discipline, men who have lived in the mountain districts remote from the law and contemptuous of it, and who have found in the present situation an opportunity and an excuse which they will be bath to abandon. This class is even now a source of difficulty to its leaders, who state defam e \ that they cannot hold their men back much longer ; and if the peace terms are not published very shortly those men will force them into an attack upon the Greeks. This feeling is general along the whole Dushme Aivalik front, which, in this respect, seems to be the danger spot of the line. , , 25 As regards the probabilities of a Turco-Greek war on a national scale, there does not seem to be much, if any, danger of such an occurrence. The Nationalist movement is not popular with the peasantry who fear the Nationalists and only submit to their demands for lack of adequate protection in the event o refusal Such protection is not afforded to them at present, and it is difficult to see how it could &gt;e b 1 . Without the employment of Allied troops, as the Regular Ottoman troops are themselves to a large extent in deCt)r .&gt;Q ^gante the numbers seen during this six weeks’ tour of the front, at no time did the wnter come across any body of iroops larger than 90 men, this being the ceremonial escort of Mehmet Effendi. In the v Uages from time to time one saw small squads of what were apparently recruits. At the various sector headquarters one saw what looked like 50 to 100 men billeted in the village or town Infrequently six or eight carts were seen on roads, but nothing resembling the transport requnements of large num eis of troops.
