Political Agency, yiji I mMHm e RB9tO€NCY,Bahrain, the 28th May 1934, 1 ' 4S-' /&gt;»(♦ : OOKflOIHTlAL mom I Shaikh T Abdullah bin f Isa is leaving suddenly 'by this mail (May 28th) for the Lebanon in order to get special medical treatment (this is genuine) for one of his Family and expects to be away some six weeks. 2. I have had conversations with him about the Budget and the Civil List, and have emphasised that the Government of India naturally regard the proportion of tne revenue swallowed up by the Civil List as far too high. I have tried to put into his mind that it is advisable to have definite proportions allocated to the Ruling Family and to the administration, so that in good times and in bad times they will share alike. He takes a sensible view in financial matters and understands them, and I will take these questions up again on his return. 3. In the meantime Shaikh Eamad is very anxious to have a share of the proceeds of the acquisition of land, the amount mentioned on his behalf by Shaikh T Abdullah being 'one half of the balance'. The meaning of this in figures is as follows Payments made by His Majesty T s Government to the Bahrain Government Rs.196,031/- Fayment made by Bahrain Government to private o T jmers 49,32?/- Balance to credit of Bahrain Government Rs.146,704/- Refunded to Reserve Rs.50,000/- Allocated to Causeway 30,000/- 80,000/- Balance Rs.6b,704/- Shaikh asks for Rs. 33,352/-Is 2. 4. I told Shaikh Abdullah in one of the early talks that I had mentioned the matter to you and that it was desirable to settle the general question of the Civil List and kindred matters; and that I would write to you. 5. Shaikh T Abdullah came over urgently on the 24th May and asked that the Shaikh might have Rs.10,000/- to use towards the expenses of his relatives' moves out of the towns for the hot weather and so on. I think that he hoped, if successful, to get the Shaikh to give him something towards the expenses of his journey to the LebanonI I felt that in view of how well the Shaikh had helped us over the acquisition and of his admirable reception of His Excellency the Viceroy (which cost him something), it would have been, and would be regarded as, scurvy treatment to make a complete refusal, or even to work for further delay, so event ually I gave him the Rs.10,000/-. 6. Personally, 1 am very loath to connect the proceeds of the acquisition with any argument over the finances of the State, except to emphasise the one-third/two-thirds proportion, and Shaikh 'Abdullah points out with some force that half the balance is nothing like as much as one-third of the whole would be, and that in the time of his Father the Shaikh would have had the whole. T i feel that the Shaikh has well earned a share, and as he has himself refunded half a lakh to the Reserve (which is a long move in the right direction for an Arab Ruler), it would be hard to refuse him the comparatively modest share for which he asks. He feels a natural diffidence in broaching the matter to me himself, but 1 know that he feels strongly that he has a right to a portion and 1 would much prefer to approve his having the balance of Rs.23,3b2/- without delay or bargaining. if you approve, would you kindly telegraph the one word 'GRANT'. 7. 1 think tnat i should add tnat a favourite device of /our3. our enemies when the Shaikh does anything to please us is to press him as to what he has got out of being our friend, and in this case for him to have got nothing for himself would be too good a chance for them to miss. he Honourable Lieut-Oolpnel T.C.iJ'owle.

In this connection, they would urge that steps should be taken to give effect to a regular convention regarding the distribution of the proceeds of oil revenues. In order to secure replenishment of.the reserve, I am to suggest that the Shaikh's proposal should be slightly revised to allow of apportionment of 1/3 to the ruling family, 1/3 to State revenues and 1/3 to reserve.

The Abstract of Revenue and Expenditure does not accurately represent the financial position of the Bahrain Government at the end of three months working since the amounts realized by the Bahrain Government for Government lands acquired by His Majesty 1 s Government, have not been taken into account and the payment of Rs.33,352/- to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah has consequently been shown as a 'loan 1 . It is assumed that these amounts will be finally adjusted by M p . Belgrave on his return from leave. Similarly, the sum of Rs.50,000/- recently refunded to the reserve has not been taken into account. 3.

This sum will eventually be debited against the sum of Rs.30,000/- earmarked for this purpose from amounts realized by the Bahrain Government from the sale of Government lands. 5 * The revenue position is satisfactory.

I have the honour to enclose herewith statements of revenue and expenditure for the first quarter of the year 1353. The revenue shows an increase of approximately Rs.53,000/- over the revenue of the first quarter of the year 1352. At the end of the first quarter of 1353 the State had a balance of Rs.53,137/- in hand. The Reserve is Rs.200,000/-; and there has been no need to draw upon it. The revenue for this quarter from the Customs shows an increase of Rs.72,564/- over budget average expectations, which includes Rs.20,000/- from Pearling licenses, and Rs.2,800/- from Vehicle Licenses. It should be mentioned that one half of collections from Vehicle licenses is payable to the two local Baladiyahs. Actual Customs receipts exc ed those of the first quarter of the years 1352, and 1351, owing to heavy imports of rice. The expenditure for this quarter has exceeded the average expectations, on account of certain special payments, namely: cost of Adviser's passage on leave; summer leave pay granted in advance to schoolmasters; one year's rent of quarantine station; two neir typewriters purchased for the Adviserate; leave pay in advance of Public Works officials; expenditure upon the Manamah-Muharraq sea road.

The prospects of theifi being an abundant supply of oil have improved as the result of experience in one or two of the recent wells, though it is too early to make any definite pronouncement. It is possible that a market may be found in Japan, but it is, again, too early to make any definite statement. 4.

Dated, Hajab, 26, 1353 Hovember 4, 1934 From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward a statement of revenue and expenditure for the first half of the current year which ended on 29th J Thany 1353, corresponding to the 9th October 1934. 2. Apart fro a payments received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company the revenue is almost the same as that of the first half of the previous year. The actual revenue for the period under review amounts to more than half the total revenue estimated in the Budget for the whole year 1353 by s 54,665/-, but as this includes certain receipts sucn as pearling licenses which are pi id at the beginning of the diving season, it cannot be presumed that the second half of the year will be equally pro ductive.-2- *&gt;0 3. The total expenditure for the first six months exceeds last years expenditure during the saiie period by ! s 23,105/- and it exceeds the budgeted anou nt by 21,174/-. Of this expenditure Fs 16,053/- has been spent upon the Manamah Maharaq road and Is 5,242/- was paid to the Electric Supply department and it iilikely that before the end of the year a further amount will be required by the Electric Account to enable it to continue working. No provision was rrade in the 1353 budget for expenditure on the Sea Hoad, but this undertaking was aade possible by the receipt of money from sale of land which is shown in the enclosed statement but is not included as ordinary revenue. No provision was ;nade in the Budget for a deficit in the Slectric Supply Department. 4. The financial position of the Electric Department is at present most unsatisfactory. The supply of light an. uower in Manamah and Muharraq is an expensive luxury which is being heavily subsidised by the Government. Loans are being made to the Slectric Department by the Government with small prospect of their being recovered. 1 will forward a report on this subject within a few days. 5. At the end of the first six months of 1352 the total amount in the Government accounts was Rs 2,54,863/- including the reserve, at the end of J/Thany 1353, the Government feave ai a reserve of 3 lacs and also a sum of Hs 1,22,793/- in its various accounts.

Sir I have the honour to forward in triplicate the Annual Report of the Bahrain Government for 1553 and the Budget Estimates for 1354. 2, During the year 1353 the reserve was increased to Rupees three lakhs, which were placed on fixed deposit with the Eastern J Bank. Liniitedj Bombay. Towards the end of the year a deposit of Rupees one lakh fell due and was not re-invested. The local branch of the Eastern Bank Limited, which acts as the Government treasury, asked the State authorities to increase the amount of their current account in Bahrain in return for the work which the Bank was doing for the Government. This amount was , therefore, paid into the current account of the Bahrain Government and the reserve still remains at Rupees two lakhs. 3. During 1354 the State should receive substantial sums from The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited on account of payments from royalties on oil. In this connection I think the time nas come for some definite decision to be maae in regard to (a) the Civil List and, (b) the Reserve. In regard to C^O • The Civil -ijist at present apMrouriates approximately 50$ of the revenues of the State. It is further inflated by the arrangement whereby royalties from oil are shared on a basis of l/3rd to the Civil List and 2/3rds to the State. It Is true that this arrangement will eventually reduce the /percentagepercentage of the Civil List to total revenue. Two much reliance, however, should not be placed on revenues from oil due to marketing difficulties and fluctuations. I think it would be wise to limit the Civil List to a definite percentage of normal revenues now. Should oil royalties decrease it is more than possible that the corresponding decrease in the Civil List would be made good from normal revenues to the detriment of the State. in the past that the State should endeavour to build up a reserve equal to a year's normal income. I recommend that this should again be impressed on the Ruler. 4. I wish particularly to draw your attention to page 6, paragraph 7. In regard to (b).

No. t^W/s.F. of 3^354 Offico of the A-dviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, R/iwal. 1354- June ^ 1935. from The financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To H. B. M , 3 Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your infor- mation the Budget of the Bahrain State for the year 1354 with a report on Revenue and Expenditure and the annual report for the year 1353. This is the tenth Budget which I have had the honour to prepare. 2. The financial position of the State is distinctly better than it was at the beginning of last year. Revenue from nomsl sources has exceeded the revenue of 135E by approximately half a lac and the ordinary expenditure during 1352 was slightly less than the total revenue. Owing to the unexpected receipt of over one lac from sale of land to the British Gcvernaent, it was possible for this government to spend Rs 30,000/- on the construction of the Manamah-Muharraq. road whichwhich provided work for a great number of the local population at a time when many people were almost destitute through unemployment. This year the Budget has been balanced without raiding the Reserve Fund or utilising the balance in hand from the previous year. Tbe budgets of 135E and 1353 showed a deficit, and although no deficit was shown in 1351, yet at the end of the year there was a large actual deficit. The State commences the year with a reserve fund of two lacs and a balance of Bs 1,38,000/-. 3. The 1354 Budget . Revenue. Customs receipts continue to be the main source of revenue. I have estimated the revenue from Customs at a slightly higher figure than in 1353 budget. The estiiaate for 1353 was Rs 5,50,000/- including vehicle licenses: the revenue for 1353 was Rs 6,57,000/- and for 1354, I have anticipated a revenue of Rs 5,80,000/- which is Bs 33,000/- more than the amount estimated for last year, but Rs 77,000/- less than the sum which was received last year. Taking into consideration the reduction of l/8th of the direct transhipment dues on cargo to and from the ports of Saoudia Arabia, I think that the margin of safety is sufficient and I antici pate that the Customs will yield this amount. 'The only possible circumstances which I can visu alise and which would drastically reduce this revenue are a European war or the total cessa tion of re-export trade which might occur if the port of Has Tanura should be developed.-3- 4. Oil. Two trips have already been made by the oil taaker s.s. tr Rheem n and she is now on her way back to Bahrain from the far East to take anotter cargo of oil. I am informed that she will carry out two more trips at least in 1354. Each shipment of oil produces approximately Is 50,000/- in royalty for the Bahrain gOTernment. In estimating the revenue from oil I include the amount which is now owing to the government on the two shipments wliic have ready been made and I have assumed that there will be two more shipments only during 1354. I think it is most probable that the number of ship ments will exceed my expectations. 5. When the Bahrain Petroleum Company obtained an extension of the Prospecting License in 1352 an agreement was made between the Company and the Government according to which the Company lent to the Bahrain govern ment Rs 50,000/-. This loan was to be recovered from future royalties by instalment s. The pro portion of the refund due from the Bahrain government on the amount of royalty which I have estimated in the Budget is Rs 35,000/-, the remaining Es 15000/- will be recovered when more royalty payments are made. 6. Other revenue . I have assessed the remaining sources of revenue at a total of Es 55,000/- which is less than what they were expected to produce last year. The actual receipts during 1353 failed to reach the esti- mate of the Budget. There was a disappointing-4- disappointing falling off in Judicial receipts and several other items. 7. It may be observed from the various sources of revenue that the people of Bahrain are very fortunate in the matter of taxation. With the exception of customs duties, which in comparison to those of neighbouring countries, are extremely low, there is scarcely any taxa tion. Income tax, land tax, date tree tax, zikat or ashur are not levied and the only existing house tax is the very low municipal house tax which is paid by the people of Man amah and Muharraq. In spite of this I think it can be reasonably claimed that the government of Bahrain does more for the public welfare of its people in the direction of education, justice, public security and muni cipalities than any other State in the Persian Gulf, a fact which the people themselves seem rarely to appreciate. 8. Expenditure . Civil List . The Civil List represents the actual amount which is paid in emoluments to the members of the Euling family but it doss not include the allowances which are made to certain oi xhe Ruling Family for the services which they render as Magistrates, Amirs etc. These pay ments are included under Judicial, Public Security and other headings. 9. Share in royalty amounting to Rs 55,000/- represents l/3rd of the royalty paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company to the Bahrain government. This amount is .to bebe paid to the Privy Purse of His Excelleuey Shaikh Sir Hamad. Out of this aiaount certain allowances which have already been paid are recoverable. The total payments which will be made during the year to the Ruling Family amount to over 50&gt; of the estimated revenue. 10. State Protection . There is an increase in the cost of State Protection, this is owing to the State Police iforce having been brought up to full strength in order to pro vide sufficient men for carrying out the police duties which have increased during the last year. The number of police exceeds last year f s personnel by 16 men. 11 • Government de oartaents . The total estimated expenditure on governsBnt departments also shows an increase. In the year 1351 owing to the need for drastic economy the pay of the clerical and other staff, excluding persons receiving less than Hs 36/- per month, was reduced by 10^. This action was similar to that taken by other governments in other countries and at iC&lt;^r was time it is necessary. I feel that the improved financial condition of the State now justifies the step of restoring part of the cut and in this Budget I have provided for the restora tion of one half of the 10% cut. In England and in India, I understand that the reduction which were made have been restored in full. 12. Municipalities . The subsidies to the Manamah and Muharraq municipalities remain the same. For some years the government has considered the possibility of improving the-6- the conditions of Hedd-wfaicb is the third largest town in Bahrain and the most unsani tary and dirty. The people of Hedd who are almost entirely pearl divers, are, with a lew exceptions, very poor, and it is unlikely thai taey would at present be able to contri bute much towards a runicipality. I have allocated tae su^ of s 200/- per month to be spent on cleaning the streets of Hedd and for widening the one road which is at present impassable for motor traffic. The Muharraq municipal council, with possibly two or three additional members from Hedd will deal with this work. Education . An additional sum of Rs 3,500/- has been allowed for the opening of three country schools in the Shia villages. This expansion is in answer to the recent request by the Shia community that the govern ment should pay more attention to the education of the Shias who form the majority of the population. 14. The remaining items of expenditure do not differ greatly from the amounts in the last year's budget. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant. Adviser to the Government.tj Report on the Revenue for 1353. 1. Gus toias . There has been an increase of approxiaately half a lac in the revenue col lected by the customs department which includes, besides customs dues, vehicle, pearling and boat licenses. This increase is explained in the report from the Director of Customs. 2. Oil. light instalments of Bs 5,769/- were received during the year fro'a the Bahrain Petro leum Company according to tie Supplementary agreement dated November Zl t 1933. talments were paid in 1358. The total pay ment amounted to Es 75,000/-, of which Rs 50,000/- was recoverable from future royalties. In addition to this sum the government also received Rs 20,000/-, not recoverable, being the amount payable according to the minimum royalty clause of the Supplementary Agreement. 3. Lease of aerodrome . This represents the lease of the manamah aerodrome for which two instalnents, for 13 months, were paid during the year. 4. With the exception of Judicial receipts, interest on reserve, and loans recoverable, the revenue from other sources corresponds closely to that received during the last year. 5. Interest on Reserve . Interest on Reserve has fallen from approximately Rs 3,000/- to Rs 5,000/'- mainly owing to the decline in rates of interest. Money which was placed on deposit in 1351, on which interest accrued in 1352 obtained a good rate, it sf/as reinvested in 1352 at a muchmuch lower rate* The money available for inirestment in 1352 was Rs 2,50,000/-, the fol- lowing year it was only Ss 2,00,000/-. 6. Loans recoverable . Muharraq, muni- cipaliuy owe s money to the governiaent on account of a loan made to the municipality some years ago for assistance in installing electric power in Mabarraq. The amount was to he re-paid by yearly instalments of Bs 7,700/- bat this year owing to the municipality* s fin ancial difficulties it was agreed that only half the instalment should be refunded. 7• oales of land to the British Government , This is not normal revenue but is the proceeds of trie sale of three pieces of land, two in Manaaah ana one in Uuharraq, to the British government. The amount paid to the Bahrain government was gs 1,96,031/-. Out of this sua, Es 33,352/- was pa id into the Privy purse of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad, this payment is not included in the report on eapeuditure. The purchase of land from private owners cost the State Hs 45,012/- and in addition to this Rs 7,000/- was paid to shaikh Hohomed bin Isa who considered that he had a claim to all the open land in the neigh bourhood of Jufair, Es 300/- was the cost of transferring cash to Bahrain from India. The amount which accrued to the government from the whole transaction was Es 1,10,367/-. In addition to the financial arrangements a large amount of govermoent land was ej iven to the previous occupants.The Pearl Trade and the Diving Industry. Cultured Pearls . In viewing the future with the most optimistic eye it is difficult to see any likelihood of the pearl industry reverting to its former state of prosperity. As the improvement and increased production of cultured pearls continues so the deaand for real pearls decreases. When the public find that they can buy cultured pearls, which to the ordinary eye are undistinguishable from real pearls, for one thirtieth the price of genuine pearls of similar weight and appearance it is natural that they spend their money on cultured pearls. In the days when only real pearls and artificial pearls existed a pearl necklace had a certain significance, now only the owner of the necklace knows whether it is genuine or cultured. 2. The success of the cultured pearl is not only deplored among the diving community in Bahrain, and the Gulf, but also by the impor tant jewel merchants in Europe. Last summer I had the opportunity of discussing the pearl industry with several leading London jewellers who all complained that they had been severely hit by the cultured pearl. Although the important firms do not display cultured pearls in their shops yet they told me that they were reluctantly compelled to keep cultured pearls in stock as so many of their clients deraanded them. London jewellers used to make goodgood profits from selling pearls. Most of this profit is lost and in addition there is a constant danger of being cheated. The necessity of examining every pearl which is purchased in a pearl testing apparatus is troublesome and costly; there are still very few of these machines in London and the fee for testing pearls is high. 3. There is still however a market for real pearls especially in India and the last. It seems that the wealthy Indian personages and princes are still interested only in the real article. The competition of the cultured pearl has scarcely affected the seed pearls and small pearls. It is possible that the Japanese find that it is not worth cultivat ing these grades. The price of ^Sherin' 1 and «Haiai n during the last season was not iovver than the year before. 4. The 1553 season . The most significant fact of the last season was that only 340 boats went out to the banks instead of 436 which ms the total number aiving during the previous season. A decrease oi ^6 boats out of a total of 436 is very serious. It does not follow that the reduction in the number of divers was quite in proportion to the decrease in boats because in many cases indi vidual boats carried more men. 5. I have as usual examined the accounts of the diving clerks in order to arrive at an estimate of the value of the catch. In the case of boats whose accounts are not made up-3- (i^ 1 x up by the clerks I haTe taken the avaiiabie f i. ures as a 'basis on vhich to take an average for the boats whose figures are not obtainable. It should be remembered that my figures are only approximate and they represent the rockbottom prices of the pearls which change hands many times before they leave Bahrain each time increas ing the price of the pearls. Unfortunately I only began to examine these accounts a few years ago, when the slump in the pearl trade began but before 1347/48 the fi ures of the sales would have been very much higher. 6.

The public in general are of the opinion that the banks are producing, less pearls than they used to. I do not think that this can be assumed. The Arabs in the pearl industry do not take in bo consideration the de crease in the nmaber of boats. when they send out less boats the production must decrease, fhey also argue that the quality of pearls has deteriorated, that fewer valuable pearls are found, in this again they do not take into con sideration the general slump in prices of pearls but they usake comparisons between the season and seasons when the market was 1lourishing. The highest price paid for a single pearl during the-5- 13 corresponding decrease in the number of the aelafieh. Out of EyE boats viiose accounts were made up by the Drying Clerks 116 were belafieh and 1?6 were Khaiamaais. In a few years, unless conditions improve, the whole diving system will change and the belafieii system and its abuses will disappear. This would be advantageous for the diverSjalthough they would not appreciate this, but possibly it would have an adverse effect on the pearl loe rchant s. Although divers have been severely affected by the slump in the pearl trade in one respect it 1ms been beneficial. The nakhudas owing to lack of money have willingly reduced the amount of the advances each year. If times had been prosperous the advances would have remained high and the divers debts would have increased. 10. The pmrmal advances, which were settled as usual after a meeting of the leading men of the diving industry, were the same amount as the previous year. The meeting at which the Tesqam and Selaf for the new season were decided was held during the year under review and it was decided that the amounts should be reduced even lower. They were settled at ' im /~ ior a diver and % 15/- for a puller and the usual proclama tion was issued. It was thought lively that the news of a further reduction would cause a further demonstration by the divers but nothing happened and at the time of the payments many divers agreed to accept less than the authorised amount rathe.r than be discharged with M baruas H releasing them to dive with other nakhudas than their own.-6- 14 For sometiiae I have made a record of the debts of divers whose books have passed through the office and I have taken the average of about 500 divers' debts. According to these figures the average diver owes to the nakhuda about % 507/-. This is the first time that such figures have been exerdned and I think it is a very fair indication of the average diving debt. The list also inciuaes eight old. divers each of whom owes over «i 2,u0u/- and nine who are over Rs 1,000/-. 11. Although it isbver ten years since Magor iialy introduced the diving; reforms yet still some of the nakhudas, those whose treatment of divers was most notorious in the past, try constantly to evade or to up-set the regulations. One of the new rules which was most beneficial to the divers was the one by which the heirs of the dead diver were no longer made responsible for his debt to the nakhuda. At present some of the Maharaq nakhudas are agitating for this rule to be abolished. The protection of the interests of tiie divers is a thankless tasi^ the divers themselves do not realise that their interests are being safeguarded, they are utterly i .orevident and never thimOR of the future, tne nakhudas and pearl merchants, with a very few exceptions, are callous and selfish and although the Ruler is sympathetic towards the divers in principle he is liable to be influenced by the arguments of the nakhudas in individual cases.12. Certain pearl merchants when discussing the state of the trade have hinted that it might he worth considering the breeding of cultured pearls in Bahrain. I think this is a dangerous suggestion, it would affect the whole Gulf and it would have far reaching consequences.Police and Public Security. 1. Police strength . The total strength of the Police force at the end of the year was 172, N.G.Os and men, including two sections who are not yet fully trained. With this number of men it is possible to provide for all outside duties and guards and to retain about fifty men in training at the Fort in Manamah who would be available in case of emergency. The force is divided into 13 sections excluding the band and the headquarters staff. All the police, with the exception of three Indian instructors, are locally enlisted men but of the following nationalities:- Arabs 97 Persians 18 Shia Bahama 10 Manumitted slaves 8, the remainder include Swahilis, Sudanese, Iraqis, Yemanis, Kurds, Malabaris and Baluchis. 2. The late Superintendent f police . During the summer, the Police Superintendent, died very suddenly. This officer had served in the Police since the force was originally organised by the Manamah Municipality. He was a Shia Bahrani, a very loyal, intelligent and reliable officer with a particular aptitude for investigation work. By his death the government lost a most valuable servant. lifter he died a certain iaction oi the Manamah Shia community endeavoured, in a most unsuitable manner, to secure the appointment of Haji Sulman 1 s son as superintendent of Police. There is in Bahrain a certain feeling that such posts as this are hereditary. The young man in„&gt; in question had served for about 18 months in the police and is at present neither a suitable or capable man for the post which is one of con siderable responsibility requiring a man of age and experience. The work is now being carried on by the two senior Havildars, one of them deals isinly with the investigation of criminal cases and the other is responsible for the routine at the Fort and the parades. This arrangement is, so far, satisfactory. The son of the late Superintendent is learning court work and it is proposed that he should be sent to India, if arrangements can be made, to acquire experience of Indian police methods and administration. 3. Duties . The police work generally does not vary much but one or two changes have been made during the year. It was found advisable to detail a whole section for duty in the Manamah bazaar in the day time owing to the increase in motor traffic etc. The bazaar beat was formerly provided by the naturs but the authority of the uniformed police is more effective in work of this type. 4. The police now go for a route march every ounday and once or twice during the year all men who are available go out for several days making a comple te tour of the island and camping outside various villages. The people of Bahrain are surprisingly insular; most of the police are recruited from the towns of Manamah and Muharraq and very few of them have ever been into the country beyond Manamah. The sight of the police on march with their band has a good effect on the-3- / P 18 the oountry villages and also gives the men an opportunity of getting to know the geography of the island. National Anthem . A number of guards of honour, usually one hundred strong, have been provided during the year on official occasions and visits of important personages. When His Excellency the Naval Commander in Chief visited Bahrain in 1934 a national anthem for the Shaikh of Bahrain was composed by the band master of the Admiral 1 s flagship. During the summer, when I was on leave, I arranged for the tune to be orchestrated and to be recorded on a gramophone record. Unfortunately there was some delay over this and the police band were not sufficiently acquainted with the tune to play it during the last visit of H.M.S. 'Hawkins rt . Since then they have been practising it and can now play it. The tune is slightly reminiscent of n Rule Britannia'. It is hoped that it may be possible to borrow a bandsman from asa Indian army for a month or two m order to teach the police band which required the services of an expert. The following is an extract from the 'Daily Express' 'Travelling in a British warship was HAMAD, Shaikh of Bahrein, a British protectorate on the Persian Gulf. He made friends with ship's bandmaster. 'How does your national anthem go?' asked the bandmaster. 'I haven*t got one,' said the Shaikh.''I will write you one,' said Bandmaster. Did so. Difficulties arose :- 1. Piece was scored for trumpets, trombones, etc. Shaikh 1 s band con sists only of four bugles, four flutes, drums. 2. Shaikh*s band can T t read music anyway. Gramophone expert MORRIS Li..vT was consulted. Recorded music suitably, lade record of it. Record despatched to Shaikh in time for Christmas. I have heard it. It is fine tum-ti- tiddly, Ruriianian stuff, should go well in Bahrain. ' 6. Lathi Drill . The instructor who caiae Karachi Police for six months to teach Lathi drill completed his time and returned to India. About half of the Police were trained by him and a number of N.C.Us were given indi vidual instruction and they are now able to complete the training of the rest of the force. No necessity for the use of lathis has so far ocurred 7. Hedd Police Post . A whole section of the police is now stationed in Hedd, at the southern end of Muharraq island, as the aero drome duty is now double what it used to be owing to the increased air service. Some years ago the government took over some tumble down shops and buildings in the main street of Hedd on account of a debt. These have now been con verted into a police post building. There is accomodation for about twenty men, an office, a lock up, kitchen and wash house in a large compound surrounded by a high wall. Hedd is-5- is a truculent town and there lias been trouble there in the past. The existence of a regular police post in the middle of the town will assist the police in maintaining law and order. 8. Manamah Fort. Constant repairs have been necessary in the fort at Manamah. At regular intervals large sections of the outer walls and the towers suddenly collapse. The whole building needs renovating. Several of the barrack rooms became dangerous during the year and instead of repairing these rooms one long new barrack room has been built inside the fort which will accomodate about forty men. It is high and well ventilated and the men who occupy it will enjoy more healthy conditions than before. 9' Health . A drain has been dug, by prison labour, from the fort to the Municipal drain which carries off the spare water from the municipal garden. This has cleared the Fort garden of all stagnant water and since this was done there has been a noticeable diminution of malaria among the police. Their health on the whole is satisfactory and their physical standard is good. When recruits are required there are so many applications that it is pos sible to pick and choose. fhen a few men are needed as recruits thirty or forty applicants come daily to the Fort asking to be enlisted. 10. Di vine debts . A large number of the police are divers who owe money to the nakhudas. In the past only men with small debts werewere enlisted and every month they coniributed Rs 5/- to their nakhuda towards the diving debt. Recently when men owing large amounts were not accepted their nakhudas agreed to cancel a large proportion of the debt provided that the divers were enlisted as police and refunded the Rs 5/- monthly. This is a significant sign of the depression in the diving industry. 11* Maturs . The strength of the oaturs at the end of the year was as follows:- Manamah 57 Muharraq 42 Budeya k Rafaa 14 113. The amirs of Mammah and iuharraq, and Rafaa are in charge of the natura in these various places. In Mammah and Muharraq they are responsible for guarding the bazaar and patrolling the town during the night. This work has been carried out effectively and there have been very few cases of theft in the bazaars. The fact that the bazaars are lit by electric light makes it very difficult for the thieves to break into shops at night. 12. Bahrain Petroleua Company T s naturs . According to the agreement between the Bahrain government and the oil company the government has enlisted for the company a number of watch men who have been provided by the government with rifles and some ammunition. These men act as guards over wells and in the camps. They are employed by and paid by the company. The Bahrain government is not represented at-7- at the oil aaap in any way, either by a police post or by naturs. During the year there have been frequent thefts at the oaraps as well as a oase of assault which almost caused the death of a Somali. When such matters have been reported, the police have investilted the cases but none of the robberies have been traced. According to the concession agreement the Bahrain government assumes certain responsibility in the case of thefts etc. The present position is unsatisfactory. The company is known to be employing a number of bad characters many of whom have served terms of imprisonment for theft and other crimes, the naturs working at the camp are under the company 's orders, not under orders of the government, and the nearest police post is at Sakhir and only while the Ruler is in residence. IS* Crime . Dacoity . During the second half of this year there has been a recurrence of crimes which in India would be described as dacoity. Within a few months attacks were made on the village of Zinj, about 11 miles east of the Manamah fort and Barbar, a big village on the Budeya road. At Zinj the house of the richest man in the village was attacked by about a dozen men armed with rifles. The house was searched and a chest containing several thou sand rupees was removed. The owner of the house an old man, ana his wife were severely beaten by the robbers and later tiie old inan died partly as a result of the attack.-3- The attack took place at night and although the house was in the laidule of the Yillage 'si as tne inhabitants were unarmed nobody dared to coiae to the assistance of the vietiias. At Barbar two houses were raided by a large band of armed men in the middle of the night. The goods which were stolen were of s nil value. The occupants of the first house were not iaolested hut the owner of the second house refused to open the door when ordered to do so, at which the attacicers fired several shots through the door end then siaashed it in. There was a fight between the villagers and the raiders, tne villagers were badly beaten with butts of rifles but one of the raiders was wounded in the hand with a pruning knife. When the matter was investigated it was found that the raiders had carried a wooden chest from the village to a place on the sea shore half way between Barbar and Manamah and from the blood trail which they left it was evi dent that one of the robbers was badly wounded. The two cases are being investigated and a number of arrests bave been maae in connec tion with the Zmj attack. A somewhat simi lar case occurred at the end of the year when people returning from Manamah to Budeya in the evening with a donkey load of provisions were held up by two armed men, the, footpads tooK to flight however on seeing other people coming down the road. for several years Bahrain has been free from cases of this kind although eight or-s- 2 4 or nine years ago they were of frequent occur rence. There is reason to believe that the ringleaders and many of the culprits are Haasawis who slip across to the mainland after carrying out an attack. The two attacks on villages have produced a very unfortunate result locally. The 3hia Bahama are thoroughly alarmed and every village has arranged a system of armed watchmen to :ieep off robbers, when the country people go to the gardens at night for work in the irrigation channels, they go in parties carrying rifles. This is an unsatis factory state of things as the Bahama are apt to fire off rifles at harmless people thinking that they are robbers. 14. Muharraq murder . A well known prostitute of Muharraq. was murdered, sewn up in a sack and thrown into the sea. The cause of the murder was jealousy between the frequenters of two n Dars :i which can be described as cluos patro nised by •. j . . '.v? .1 bftd J**- raotdr• The caseA«pu&gt; fully investigated and the police were satis fied that the murder had been done by certain persons but the actual evidence was Insuf ficient to obtain a conviction. The suspects were all foreigners from the mainland and they were repatriated to their country. 15, Hitrah murder . At the end of the year a murder took place in Sitrah, one Bahrani shot another Bahrani through the head with a rifle. The cause of the quarrel was jealousy over s woman of bad character who lived in the same village. The murderer was tried by the Bahrain-10- Eakrain Court and sentenced to death. 16. a ad l Ition . In connection with the attacks on zinj and Bar'car the police carried oat several searches of villages and while this was being done it \.as discovered that a very lar^e percentage of the popula tion are in possession of rifles and ammuni tion. I estimate, roughly, that there are between two and three thousand serviceable rifles in the possession of the Bahama villagers and probably an even greater pro portion in the arab villages such as Rafaa, Zellag and iiudeya. Although the import of firearms is for bidden there is no law forbidding the possession of firearms in Bahrain. I have reason to suppose that firearms are being smuggled into Bahrain from the mainland. I have discussed the question with His .Excel lency bhaikh Hamad and his brothers and they are in favour of a system of registration such as in force in most other countries. It is proposed to issue a proclamation stating that all rifles mu be registered, they will be stairifcea and numbered and the transfer of rifles will be forbidden. I am confident that legislation on these lines will contri bute to reduce the number of crimes by armed men.5 u Judicial. 1 • Chames in the Bahrain Courts . The noticeable fallinr off in court fees collected 'by the Bahrain Court during the year is partly owing to the present state of poverty and partly I think owing to the disorganisation in the Bahrain Court which finally tereiinated when Shaikh Sulmn was given permission to retire from the court for a year. During most of the summer he presided alone while the Adviser was on leave and this gave an oppor tunity to a certain section of the ohia community to organise agitation and complaints against some of the finding of the court. Z, On Shaikh dulman's retirement one of his younger brothers, Shaikh Abdullah bin Shaikh Hamad, was appointed as magistrate on the Bahrain Court. Shaikh Abdullah has the advantage of a better education than Shaikh Sulman and in addition to this he has several years experience on the Smell Joint Court. Shaikh Abdullah seems to be very well fitted for the post, he belongs to the youn er generation and has been brought up under the present regime in an atmosphere of law and order which differs exceedingly to the conditions before the present ruler took over control. The two generations have a very dif ferent outlook on things in general. The appoint ment of Shaikh Abdullah is popular with the public. 3. His place on the Junior Joint Court has been filled by Shaikh lOialifah, one of the younger sons of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, who was educated at Beyrut University and speaks English well. He9 r* /W I -id- He is almost the only member of the Khalifah family who has learned English. He has no previous experience of court work but he appears to be doing well. It wuld perhaps seem more suitable that positions such as these should be held by the elder sons and nephews of the Ruler but unfortunately most of them are entirely unsuitable and quite uneducated. S. Number of oases heard. The Bahrain courts during the year dealt with over 1200 cases. Only four appeals were made from judgments and in each case judgments were upheld by the Ruler. The total amount of court fees collected was lU ^,800/-, in 135E the court fees amounted to li 18,000/-. Twentytwo estates are being administered by the Bahrain Court. 4. Functions of the Bahrain Court . The Bahrain Court is the highest of the Bahrain government courts, the only appeal from its decisions is to the Ruler himself. The court sits during three days of the week, from a a.m. until p.m., and it deals with a great variety of cases including the following categories. a. Civil cases in which the amount involved is not less than 500/-. The amount has recently been raised from Bs 250/- to % 50u/- in order to relieve the court of some of its work. b. Criminal cases except those of a trivial nature. c. Land cases which include boundary disputes, irrigation disputes anci Questions of water rights. d. Diving cases, fish trap cases. e. Inheritance.-3- 28 6. Cases involving conpliccited. accounts are ret erred by the court to the 'Majlis Tijara' which, also deals with certain diving cases, inheritance and divorce eases are dealt with by the dhera courts but in every case the judgments of these advisory courts are referred back to the Bahrain Court for confirmation and promulgation. In addition to these duties the Bahrain Court examines every sale or registration of property before a title deed is issued and satisfies itself that the particulars in the title deed which is applied for are correct. Although this mxk is very laborious and takes much time its eventual value will be very great. The systems of water rights in Bahrain is extre mely complicated and is the subject of incessant litigation but by degrees it is being examined ana recorded. 7. The Bahrain Court acts as a Public Trustee in cases when the heirs apply for administration by the Bahrain Court. The court charges no fee for administration except the original court fee which is levied on the whole estate. Bankruptcy cases are dealt with in a similar way. 8. The Bahrain Court does not work according to any legal code or regulations, except in important criminal cases such as murder. In trying cases of this nature the court is guided by the Indian Penal Code or rather by the Sudan penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure which is ba-sed on the Indian penai Code and viiich is published in Arabic. whenever possible the courtcourt appoints assessors to examine and deal with cases, especially disputes about water rights, fish traps and boundaries. It is remsrlsble how willing the public are to assist the courts in aatters of this kind which frequently involve visits to gardens outside the towns. Agitati on for a code . I aia confident that the public are genuinely satisfied with the normal administration of justice by the Bahrain Court as long as the court does not consist of one individual only. During last summer conditions were abnormal and the feelings of the Shia community were stirred by the deci- N sion of the Bahrain court in certain cases between Shia Bahama and members of the Ruling Family. Certain members of the Shia community in lanamah, who are better educated than the country people, became the leaders of a move ment which made representations to the govern ment asking for greater recognition of the Shia Bahama who form perhaps two thirds of the whole population, Among other demands they asked that a code should be drawn up for use in the Bahrain Courts which they thought would prevent the possibility of unfair treatment to Bahama. Most of their demands were reasonable and have already been dealt with to their satisfaction but the committee which is to examine the ques tion of a code has not yet begun to work owing to the absence of the Shia leader Haji Mansoor al Arayadh who is eminently suitable to represent the Shia community on the committee. I am myself-5- myself entirely in favour of a code, provided that it is simple, on the lines of the Sudan Uode, for use in the Bahrain Court and I made the suggestion myself some years ago.Shia smkf Department. Ravenue Es 32,000/- iixpenaiture Us 28,000/- There is very little to report on the ohia ^akf Department. It has carried out its usual duties during, the year of administering the siakf funns and in improving the wakf properties. Over 2000 young date trees were planted in wakf gardens, 15 mosques were repaired and certain shares in the gardens ©ere purchased in order to consolidate wakf property. four gardens were the subject of litigation in the court and were proved to 'be wakf. The department drilled two artesian wells, one of which was a failure, south of Manama and obtained a water supply which was sufficient to put under cultivation a large piece o^la-nd which was wakf property. It is likely that early in the next year there will be an election for the aajlis of the wakf department. The present members have sat on it for several years and it is advi sable that they should be changed occasionally. The wakf department has also been criticised by the general public who consider that during last year it paid too much attention to improving wakf gardens whose income was paid to Jhai&amp;h Abdullah, the Shia Qadi of Manaiaah. There is some foundation for this criticism.32 The only survey work which has been done during the year, apart from plans for sale deeds and registration of titles, was a survey of certain areas claimed by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad and specially excluded from the area over which the Bahrain Petroleum Company hold their mining lease. These areas were surveyed by the Land Department in conjunction with the com pany^ surveyors. Aerial Survey . During the year the Royal Air force carried out an aerial survey of the whole of Bahrain, excluding Muharraq which has already been photographed from the air. This work was done at the request of the Bahrain government end the Bahrein Petroleum Company, the latter are interested in obtaining a record of land under cultivation at the begin ning of the lining Lease and the aerial pe photo graph was the best method of registering the cultivation. The cost of the survey will be paid for by the Bahrain government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, each paying half. When ticie and money permit the Land Department ¥/ill link up their own survey work, which includes almost all the cultivated area in Bahrain, with the aerial map which is to be produced. This will be a very valuable record combining boundaries, water rights etc. etc., but it will take a great deal of work and at present there^nobody available to undertake it. 3. Registrations . There has been an increase in the number of registrations during the year and-2- &lt;1% 3 3 and a corresponding increase in the revenue from this source, 537 In the previous year total number of regis trations was 440. Increase Es 2,770/- 4. Purchase of land by British Goverrment , The purchase of three large areas of land by the British government from the government of Bahrain was completed at the beginning of the year. This transaction was complicated as the Bahrain govern ment had to buy out the private owners of property within the three areas and the time available for settling the matter was very short. The private owners were paid more than the real value of their properties and they were also given grants of land in other areas by the Bahrain government. It was necessary to take this action in order to prevent a number of people considering that they had been badly treated. 5, Fisa traps and government forms etc . Four hundred fish trap licenses were renewed dur- ing the year but about three hundred owners have failed to renew their licenses. Revenue from ground rents and sales of small pieces of ground, usually blank alleys or corners, amounted to Bs 2,161/-. Nearly 13,000 govermaent forms were sold producing a revenue of Hs 1,600/-. These forms Sales registered Titles registered flif-hs ' Gifts 354 154 12 . 17 (free) Wakf property Revenue 1352 Rs 4,010/- M 1353 6,780/-' 3 - '■'34 torsis are usod for recoipts, leases and agree ments and correspond to revenue stamps bjit they are of one denomination, 31 trail fish traps . The disagreement between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the owners of fish traps which are said to be damaged by the pier at Sitrah smL was finally settled by mediation. A number of meetings were held in the Bahrain government office and eventually the company agreed to reduce the end of the pier and to pay a full year* s rent to all trap owners. The owners agreed to this formula, and the dispute which has lasted for about two years, has finally been settled. 7. f.ublic Works . Manamah-Maharaq. road. Cost Rs 30,500/-. Great progress has been made during the year on the Sea-rend and employment was provided for numbers of Bahrain subjects who were without work. It is now possible to drive a car along the sea road to a distance of about 700 yards from the Manamah end to a point where one section of the road has been entirely com pleted with parapet etc. It is difficult to describe exactly what construction has been completed during the year but it is very clearly illustrated by three photographs taken from the air through the courtesy of the Officer Command ing, Ho. &lt;103 Squadron, Royal Air Force, Bus rah. I hope to obtain copies of the photographs to illustrate this report. 8. Plans and blue prints of a ferry capable of carrying motor cars were obtained from the Port Director of Busrah and also from Baghdad. Tte 'Iraq, government were asked whether they could-4- oould lend an Engineer to report on the project, but they were unable to do so. I am confident that a ferry on the lines of the one described could be made in Bahrain. 9. I do not regard it as unadvisable to proceed with the work before deciding on the type of ferry. Apart from the ferry, whose main use will be to convey cars across the deep channel, the completion of the road up to both sides of the deep channel would be of very great benefit to Manamah and to Muharraq# Until a ferry exists passengers could cross in motor launches or in sailing boats. The eventual distance between the two ends of the road will be about 800 feet. If the road is completed it will take less than ten minutes to reach Muharraq, from Manamah by motoring to the end of the road and crossing in a launch and com munication between the two islands will no longer depend upon tides and weather. The completion of the sea road is regarded by His Excellency Diiaikh Hamad as a matter of the very greatest importance, since the work has ceased whenever I am with him he speaks about continuing the construction of the road. 10. Customs pier . Necessary repairs were carried out on the customs pier. The pierhead which is exposed to all the rough weather, was seriously damaged. It has been strengthened by an additional stone wall built from the sea bed almost to the height of the pier extending across the head of the pier and a short distance alon^ each side.I ——-5- 3 6 11. Manama:.! fort . Rs 2,154/-. A large new barrak room was built in the Fort capable of holding about 40 men. It is made of 'Iferush' between solid stone pillars roofed in the usual way. The length of the room is 100 feet and the width is 21 feet. 12. Hedd oolioe station . Ss 1, 052/-. A description of this building is given in the report on the Police. 13. Other work carried out by the depart ment consisted mostly of repairs and upkeep of government Duildings and gardens. No work has been done by the government on roads. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have constructed several new roads in the centre of the island and have widened and improved the road on the Rafaa hill as well as doing a great deal of work on the Manamah-Rafaa road.3 Manamah Municipality. Revenue la5E Is 55,600/- ilxpend iture VdbZ4^, 400/- Revenue 1353 Expenditure 58,200/- 35,^8^/- The activities of the municipality have been somewhat restricted owing to the need for economy and apart from the routine work such as cleaning the town and repairing the roads etc. very little important work has been done during the year. Z, Municipal elections . Towards the end of the year there was a municipal election and the representative composition of the council was changed in accordance to the request of the Shia community who recently asked the government to increase the number of the Shia members on the municipal council. The election was carried out in the usual way, by voting. A list of qualified electors was shown, on the municipal notice board for ten days and members of each community voted on appointed days. Electors appeared at the municipal oil ice in person and filled in the voting cards which they placed in a closed ballot box which was opened after the election in the presence ot a committee. jtreviously no person was quali fied to vote unless he paid not less than Us 8/- per annum in municipal taxes, this amount has been reduced to 3/- as the general scale ofof taxation has diminisbed during recent years. The council now consists of the following members. Half the members are elected by the public and half are nominated by the Government which an nounces its choice after the public election. Members elected by the public are not eligible for re-election on the next council but the government has the right to re-elect any members. In this case the government did not avail itself of this right and consequently a clean sweep has been made of the former members of the council. This somewhat drastic action was popular with the public who were becoming impatient at certain members who had occupied seats on the council ior so many years that they acquired the impression that they were indispensable and entitled to sit on the council as a flatter of course. The change oou^d only be made by instituting a clean sweep. The composition of the new council is very representative as apart from the question of nationality it contains members of several local factions. 3, Mnrti ci tja'i secretary . During tiie year Ali bin Hussain Khalfan, who had been secretary to the municipality for 8 years, was dismissed. He was directly responsible for most of the improvements and progressive works which were carried out by the municipality, he was an elected Arabs Bahama Persians Jews 3 3 E a a i1? -3- an energetic and intelligent Secretary 'but unfortunately he incurred the displeasure of certain leading merchants and members of the Ruling family. The position of Secretary to the municipal council is a difficult one, the last three secretaries have been dismissed under a cloud. for some months the Head Clerk, Abdurrehmn Shaiji, acted as Secretary until the appointment of the new Secretary, Mohomed Salflh son of Yusuf Shattar a local merchant. The new Secretary is a local Arab who has been educated and iho speaks English well# He worked in the gofernment Electric Department for five years, first under Mr. Jordan of Messrs. Gailender 1 s Cable &amp; Construction Co., and then under the present State jsngineer. He was transferred from the Electric Department to the Municipality. His appointment to the post was popular except among those who uiohed to obtain the appointment for cnemseives oi for their relations. 4. Boad Work. Work has been done on various roads within the municipal area. A number of houses were demolished in Has Roman, south east of the garden of the Political Agency, in order to extend the road, which passes the south side of the Political Agency, to the sea shore where it will connect with the Mananah- Maharaq road V ^e lanaimh Goyernment Soad (sea road) has been resurfaced and widened by filling in the depression along the southern edge. This has given an additional ten feet to the road which is a valuable improvement.-4- filling and surfacing has been done in inany other places, on Prior Hoad, on two roads which connect Government Road and Prior Hoad and on the palace Road. Unfortunately it is impossible to prevent donkeys from using the roads in the town ana this invariably spoils the mud surface. 5. Reclaimiitf; rround . The .on of filling in the stagnant pools which lie opposite the municipal building inside the Government Road has been continued. These two pieces of water which are an eyesore and a danger to the public health are the property of the Ruler and one of his sons and there appears to be no possibility of their being iilled in by the owners. Being adjacent to the fruit and fish markets they become a dump for decaying refuse. About 1500 2 50 feet of the swamp at the back of the town has been reclaimed by the municipality and the remainder ol the water is treated with oil at regular intervals to destroy mosquitoes. 6. Hnundaries . In conjunction with the Bahrain Petroleum Company the government constructed a series of stone boundary pillars defining the municipal boundary. similar action was taken in Muharraq. 7. G-arden. Various improvements have been made in the municipal garden. The houses of the wild animals in the zoological section have been enlarged, the western part of the garden has been laid out and planted-5- with bushes and flowers and the drain vdiich carries superfluous water to the sea has been repaired. The small municipal garden North of the palace was remoTed during the summer by order of the Ruler. It was suggested to him that mosquitoes were breeding in it although actually this was not the case. Many thousands of rupees had been spent on the garden by the municipality and it was used by the public during the sumioer. 8, Miscellaneous . A wall was built at Houra to prevent the sea irom destroying the low lying land near the village. 'Jhe taxi stand, behinu. th@ municipality was rebuilt. Municipal wells and water channels were repaired. An artesian well was constructed with the municipal drill. fhe pump on the edge of the stagnant water behind the torn was worked for several months and water was pumped to the sea. ji new municipal garage was cuilt. Over 3000 houses were renumbered, me municipality took over the sale of meat during Ramadan and also sola meat during the butchers* strike ihich consequently collapsed. A tax was imposed on hawkers iho were forbidden to trade without a municipal license. A tax was imposed on coffee Shops, hotels and bakers.-6- Municipal lights were Kept until five hours after sunset instead of four hours after sunset. The municipal slaughter house was repaired.Muharraq Municipality. BeYenue Us 32,000/- Sxpenditure Rs 28,000/- Ko new work of noticeable importance have been carried out during the year but the muni cipality has continued its usual programme of road widening, town cleaning and reclamation. Artesian wells . Three artesian wells were equipped with pipes taps and waives similar to those installed by the Manamah municipality. One artesian well was re-drilled and equipped with valves etc. Bazaar improvements . four bazaar roofs were repaired and rebuilt. eleven houses were partly demolished in order to wiaen roads and some of the municipal property was repaired. A new garage was built for the municipal lorry. Cemetery mosGue . The municipality, with some assistance from the public, built a mosque at the entrance of the Muharraq cemetery. This acts as a mortuary chapel.Education. Increase in students . The progress of the Department of Education during the year has been satisfactory. The total number of students, including girls attending the government schools at the end of the year was over 1150 which is about 190 more than at the end of the previous year. The increase in the Manamah school consists mostly of boys from the Mission school and the school of Ibrahim Arayadh, the latter school is closing at the end of the school year and it is understood that the Mission school is also con templating closing down altogether. In this event it is likely that next term there will be more applications for entry to the Manamah boys school that the institution can deal with. The opposition among the Shia community in Manamah to the government boys' school which has existed for some years is now apparently subsiding as at the end of the year there were 78 Shias at the Manamah school out of a total of approximately 250 boys. developments . Scouting has been intro duced in the Manamah and Muharraqt boys' schools by two of the masters who had experience in this work in Syria. It is a popular movement and there is great competition among the boys to become scouts. On various occasions during the year they have taken part in public events and during the accession cele brations they gave an exhibition of drilling etc. The boys are not only being taught drill etc. but they learn the principles of the movement. Half an•2- an hour * s physical exercises is no w included in the daily programine of the schools, I think on the whole the physical condition of the boys has improved though a great many of them still suffer from skin and eye diseases. The girls 1 school held an exhibition of their needle work at the end of the term and the work which they produced was extremely good and would have found a reauy sale, but none of the students wishes to sell the work. In the opinion of the teachers the girls are on the whole more intelligent than the boys and they learn more rapidly. It is possible however that this is because the girls are more regular in attendance at school and do not, as is the case with many of the boys, leave school as soon as the diving season begins. At the end of the year nine boys from the two top forms in the Manamah and Muharraq^ schools passed out and obtained certificates. They are all now working, some in their fathers 1 offices and others in government employment.Agriculture. An increasing number of Arabs are becoming interested in agriculture and every year more land is being put under cultivation. In the past nothing was grown in the gardens except dates, lucerne and local vegetables but now three or four landowners are making experiments in growing luropean vegetables and different kinds of fruit. Last year cabbages, cauli flowers and potatoes were grown locally, though in small quantities, and sold in the bazaar where they found a ready market. Unfortunately it doesnot seem possible to grow vegetables in Bahrain all through the year, during the summer months from June till October only local vege tables can be grown. During the year 1^50 fruit trees were imported into Bahrain, these included orgnges, mangoes, limes etc. The government bought a few good quality man; oes from India and it appears that some of these are likely to produce fruit during the first year. The example of the government in planting oranges at Sinaian has undoubtedly encouraged many people who own gardens to experiment in growing oranges and there is every reason to expect that the experi ment will be successful. Last year's crop from Sinaian was slightly greater than the previous year and the oranges were very large and of good quality. Dates. Over 7,000 young date trees were imoorted into Bahrain, mostly from Saoudia-Arabia, ins pite of the very heavy export duty which has-2- ^ 4 7 lias been imposed on young date trees by the oaoudia-Arabia government. Last year the value of fresh and dried dates imported into ixJircdn was over Rs &lt;5,00,000/- so it is evident tiiau a great many more dates could be grown in B &amp;hrain for local consumption, apart from tne possibility of export. It is surprising that the Bahrain gardens should produce such good dates as the date trees are not properly dealt with and are never manured. Most of the gardens belong to the Kuling family who with a few exceptions spend no money on the upkeep or improvements of the gardens. Some years ago the trees in a section of Siaaian garden were manured in the way which is pra ctised in Egypt and elsewhere, trenches were dug round the base of the trunks and filled with manure. The subsequent improvement in the crops from the trees which were dealt with in this way has been noticeable. The date season ikst year was ..ood, crop was not injured by storms locusts or disease, the prospects for the next season are at present unusually good. It is now over three years since the last visitation of locusts to Bahrain, before then they used to come almost every other year and they did much damage to ground crops and date trees. The number of cases brought by landlords against their tenants for failure to pay rents have been fewer during the year than usual. This partly because the leases have been reduced and also because landlords find that there is//k -3- ^ 4 8 is little to be gained by suing tenants who tare no possible means of paying debts. In the past all the gardens were leased by the Arab owners to Bahama tenants, recently many landlords hate stopped letting their gardens, owing to non-payment of rent, and ard orbing them by paid labour# These labourers are always Hassawis, they are a troublesome type, notorious thieves and much bolder than the Bahama. The presence of large communities of Hassawis out in the Bahama villa-ges is not very desirable. In two recent cases of armed attacks on villages it appears that the ringleaders were Hassawis. Tobacco . At various times small plots of tobacco have been grown in Bahrain, usually on Sitrah island. This year Hussein Yatim has planted several different kinds of tobacco at Barber which is growing very well. Most of leaf tobacco in Bahrain is imported from the Batna coast. If tobacco could be grown and dried in Bahrain it would form a very useful industry. Tomatoes . Gardeners in Bahrain find that they can grow tomatoes during February, larch and April when apparently there is a demand for tomatoes in Iraq. This year over 800 crates of Bahrain tomatoes were exported to Iraq, ana sold at a profit. It is expected that next year the export of tomatoes will increase. Although this trade is now on a very small scale it is encouraging for the owners of gardens in Bahrain.General. 4 &amp; ConYersations with repreaentatives of Saoudia Arabia. 4tli March to 7th April 1935. During the month of March a deputation from the government of Saoudia-Arabia visited Bahrain in order to discuss various matters relating to trade and customs. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh oulman bin Hamad represented the government of Bahrain and Shaikh Khalid Abu alWilaid, Shaikh Hamad alSulaiman and Haj liohomed alAjaji were the representatives of Saoudia-Arabia. The con versations which lasted ever four* weeks were con ducted in a friendly spirit and resulted in an agreement ihich was satisfactory to both parties although the concessions which were made were entirely on the part of the Bahrain governmsnt. The Bahrain agreement will not come into force until it has been officially accepted by the government of Saoudia-Arabia. This is the first time that the Bahrain government has held direct conversations with representatives of a foreign country and although the negotiations were arranged by the British government the actual conversations took place directly between the representatives of the two countries. The Viceroy 1 s visit . In May 1934, the Ticeroy, Lord fillingdon, visited Bahrain on his way from India to England by Air. A ceremonial pe reception was arranged on the Muharraq aerodrome, which was attended by the leading notables and nembers of the British and American comlunities. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad presented the Viceroy with a sword in a golden scabbard. The State Police provided a b uard of honour, unfortunately one of the men was-2- was struck by heat stroke and died on the same day, when the Viceroy returned to India he was leceived again but on this occasion the ceremony was not so formal and the Viceroy visited Shaikh Abdullah oin Isa^ house near the aerodrome where ue drank coi i ee. This is the second time in the history of Bahrain that a Viceroy has visited uiio isianas, the previous visit was paid by Lord Curzon over 25 years ago. Imperial Airways . In January 19^5, the Imperial Airways began their double service af two Eastbound and two Westbound machines passing through Bahrain each week. Unfortunately owing to the times at which the aeroplanes arrive, it is not yet possible for the general public to receive a letter on one day and to post a reply on the following day. The Imperial Airways decided to give up their fiesthouse in Manamah and passengers are now accomodated in tents on the aerodrome. The tents are very cold in winter and very hot in summer. Bahama agitation . At the end of the summer there was some a itation on the part of the Shia Bahama which was mainly directed against the Bahrain Court and the Ruling family. A series of aggravating circumstances including the action of Shaikh Sulman on the Bahrain Court in certain cases between members of the Buling family and the Bahama culminating in a dispute between a Shia village and the Ruler over the depredations caused by the camels provoked bitter feeling on either side. These conditions afforded an opportunity to some well known politically minded members of theobi a community in Manamah to utilise the prevailing discontent as a means for obtaining certain political concessions from the government, but these concessions were really only sought by the Manamah Shias who have quite a different mentality to the ignorant and inarticulate country people. Sight representatives, four from Manamah and four from the country, were elected by the Shia community, which consists of about two thirds of the whole population, to represent their grie vances to the government. The demands which they made were not unreasonable. They asked that a code should be adopted in the Bahrain Courts, that there should be proportionate representation on the municipal councils, that the Manamah school should be handed back to the Shia community and that the Shias should have more representatives on the Majlis Tajara. Unfortunately the beha- viouu of some of the petitioners and their suppor ters# during the discussions which took place was such as might be likely to cause a breach of the peace. Eventually however the government agreed to deal with the various points which had been raised and the Shia community were satisfied. A few months later the eight Shia representatives presented another letter to the Government that a third Shia Qadi should be appointed by the govern ment and that all three should sit together on one bench, as is done in the case of the Sunni Qadis. This request caused a cleavage in the ranks of the Shias as Shaikh Abdullah bin Mohomed Saleh, the Shia Kadi in Manamah, bitterly resente± the sugges tion that he should sit with any other Qadis and-4. -:&gt;£) « 2 ej fa ana he and his supporters organised a counter petition repudiating, the eight representatives and declaring that they were acticg against fcne wishes of the Shia community. This was the position when the year ended. Notable visits . The annual visit of the Naval Commander in Chief, East Indies coincided with the celebrations of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad 1 s accession day which take place every year. One of the events during the three days 1 holiday was the police sports which took place in front of the fort. The Admiral very kindly gave permission for the Royal Marine Band from H.M.o. ^Hawkins' to play on the ground during the sports, which was greatly appreciated by the public. In February 1935, Mr. Knatchbull-Hugesson, His Majesty's Minister in Teheran paid a short visit to Bahrain, In February Rear Admiral Rive of the French lavy visited Bahrain in the sloop 'Bougainville'. In the Spring Shaikh lohomed bin Isa and some of his family flew by Imperial Airways to Kuwait where they stayed for about a month with Shaikh Ahmad al Jabr. During the summer Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa as usual paid a visit to Egypt and Syria and Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa visited Lebanon. A number of minor Shaikhs from the Trucial Coast visited Bahrain during the year as the guests of the Ruler. Draining operations . A very useful work was carried out by owners of gardens on the South of Manamah behind the Fort. For some years these gardens have been water logged andand have provided breeding places for quantities of mosquitoes. In addition to the danger to the public health owing to there being no drain for the surplus water the gardens themselves have suffered. in the suggestion ana with the assis tance of the government the owners of the various gardens combined together and built a long water channel from the neighbourhood of the gardens down to the sea and each garden is now connected to the main drain by a channel. The drain had to be cut through stone in many places but the work of blasting the rock was very suocesstuj^arried out by the State engineer. The result is very satisfactory, the spare water is now carried straight down to the sea and there has been a most remarkable decrease in the numbers of mosquitoes in that area. The cost of the work is being paid for by the owners of the gardens which are affected. Butchers* stride . For more than thirty years the butchers of Manamah had the reputation of being troublesome and truculent. They form a community in themselves and most of them are related to each other. During the Autumn they organised a strike in order to obtain a reduction in the rents of the stalls in the meat market. The strike lasted two or three days but it collapsed immediately when the Municipality, acting under orders of the Government, took over the market and sold meat to the public.4 Electric Sup.ly. Annual report for year 1353, submitted by Mr. ' ee ^ e » State Engineer. Tlie current conaumption for the year 1353 shows an increase of 17,208 units OTer 1352, partly due to an extra connected load of 16 Kw, and partly due to a slight increase in current consumption generally, economic conditions being somewhat better than of late years. Lie 1ollowing extra load has been connected during 1353;- 330 points (16 Kw.) of which 190 are light points and 140 fan points etc. Four new refri gerators were connected in Manamah. Revenue from connected load during 1353 was 36,797/- as compared with connected load during 1352, Rs 30,986/- Sixtyfive premises have been wired. In Manamah 57, as compared with 83 in 1352. In Maharaq 8, as compared with §8 15 in 1352. Total coDsuaers connected to date 554. Maximum load recorded 118,2 Kw. Total kilowatts connected to date 196. Wiring contracts . Sixtyfive houses only were wired during 1353, but the total number of points were lore, in proportion, than of previous years, due to the houses being larger. Also the wiremen were engaged on running the new telephone line to Muharraq aerodrome, the wireless station, etc., during the year 212 light points were wired at the Old and He?/ camps of the Bahrain Petroleum Co. Wiring outside the municipal area has been discontinued (see statement under Financial position) but this department continues to supply all necessary wiring material to the Bahrainw» -E- Bahraiu Petroleum Company, XgQ- Plant. Tile municipal ice plant ran fro i .Ota Muharram to 2nd Rajab, a shorter period trian usual, due to a shortage of aimaonia ( the suppliers having misdirected the cylinder) but the run was successful; 160 tons being made and sold, at a profit to the municipality. A new ireezing tank was obtained ana fitted during the winter 01 1353, prior to the seasons run, and the plant reinstalled. Transmissions etc. Losses . Transmission and transformer losses amount to 13.75^ of the total generated as compered with 18.5^ previously. This is due to the increased load and a somewhat ■4^ better power factor iirin the winter months. Generating costs. Cost per unit generated allowing for depreciation were:- in 1353 - 1.39 annas per unit. 1352 - 1.41 ff he reduction is to the increased load, and tl'B allocation of a certain proportion of the wages to outside work. ^Iso some reduction was made in the price of lubricating oil. Public telephones . The number of subscribers connected at the end of the year 1353 was 28. The rate per annum for the hire of a line telephone instrument has been reduced from Rs 150/- to s 125/-. The price for an extension instrument has been yeiueed fixed at Rs 30/- per annum. During the year a telephone line was run to Muharraq aerodrome, the deep channel crossing being made by submarine cable. ^n exchange is being installed at .luharraq. It is anticipated that a line will shortly be run to the camps of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (some^f -LasT 5 O (some 14 miles from Man am ah) where it will be connected to a 36 line exchange, for distribution in that area. The distance apart of the furthest telephone points will then be approximately 26 miles and most o... the inhabited parts of Bahrain will be within easy reach of a telephone. If inane ial pos i ti on. It will be seen that the 'it balance of Rs 19,983/- representing chiefly aepreciacion, is Rs 6,688/- less than the preTious year due almost entirely to an increase revenue from the sale of energy. The figures being:- in 1353 - Rs 36,897/1 135E - 30^986/8 difference Is — 5,810/9 A loss of something in the neighbourhood of Rs 5,000/- was sustained on wiring contracts, due to tiB lower ing of the charge for wiring light points. The price per point in Man amah and Maharraq was reduced from Rs 18/8 to approximately Es 14/- and at the Bahrain Petroleum Company new camps from ' ; 15/- to Is 13/-, £his experiment was, doubtless, tried with good intent, but was not a success, fewer houses being connected than when the price was higher and the consequent loss was as shown. With the economic position as it is at present, it is inadvisable to experiment on these lines, I mi,ht add that the prices were reduced without the knowledge and iuring the absence of the Adviser to the Goverrment and myself. This practice also resulted in the accumulation of a great deal of wiring stock, which is now so much dead weight. It has been decidedat any rate for the time being, to reduce the wiring staff to a minimum in Manamah and Muharraq and to discontinue wiring altogether at the Bahrain Petroleum Company camps, but continue tor qS 5 7 b0 3U -PPiy the latter with wiring material at scneduled rates, direct. The material does not go ihrough our stores, clearing only being done by us. Erosqect s for 1354 « Tery little revenue can be expected from wiring contracts, unless there is an advance in trade generally, but the ioilowing additions to the electricity system will be made. Juibir. British IGulf) Maval Base . Owing to the Gulf Naval Patrol (4 sloops) having aeb- moved its base to Jufair (on the be in island of Bahrain) a new Base, consisting of an Officers' Club, Clerk in Charge's house, Canteen, Stores etc. is in course of construction. This depot will be supplied from 'D w sub-station which is situated in H. S. Shaikh Sir Hamad's Palace at Godhabia, and approximately If miles from the laval depot. The connected load from this source will be, to commence with, approximately ?§ Kw, and will consist of two electric water pumps, each of 2-|H.P. five refrigerators, fans and lights. Four refri gerators have been ordered for I an amah, and it may be assumed that some 300 to 400 extra light and fan points will be edded during 1354. The government took over the agency of the International General Electric Company, Ltd., of America, and to date 40 refrigerators have been imported - 22 have been installed at the Bahrain Petroleum Company's camps, and 18 have been instal led in Man amah. This is a source of revenue and in addition increases the sale of electricity in Manamah.General. The maximum load was recorded in uhe month of Shawaal, during the anniversary celebrations of His Ezcellenoy ohaikh Sir Hamad*s accession as Ruler of Bahrain, and both generating sets were called into jise for the first time since iiieir installation. On this occasion approximately 1300 temporary lights were erected on government and public buildings and in the bazaar. The question of installing an ice storage chamber in connection with the municipal ice plant, should be seriously entertained in order that ice nay be stored on days when the demand is saall. At present the ice plant compressor has to work 24 hours a day for approximately five months, which is asking a great deal too much of it. It may be of interest to note that the load and revenue curves of the Bahrain Electricity undertaking have risen steadily since the station opened in Muharram 1343.-Z- . i 6 6 4 (sj On alcoholic liquors and tobacco ' 15^ ad valorem (□} On specified commodities known as ri luxury articles' 10/&amp; u ic) On any other commodity 5jb 51 class (c) includes the necessities of life., tnat is foodstuffs and non silken piecegoods for clothing purposes. Since a large proportion of the population are very poor, it is desirable that cereals should suffer as low a duty as is possible. There, is a small tariff in force upon produce brought to Bahrain by native craft. The reason for this is to ensure to the illiterate native the exact amount of duty he is called upon to pay and therefore this tariff is upon a quan titative basis. The theory of this tariff is upon a basis of five per cent ad valorem; it is open to revision from time to time._ It was last revised in 1^25 when the opinion was expressed that such revision should not be made too frequently, and every tenth year might be suitable. During the oast decade the value of produce, especially foodstuffs, has considerably decreased; and therefore I consider it desirable to revise this tariff during the present year, and such revision will be submitted in due course upon a valuation of 5^ ad valorem.

One factor in these increases has been the declaration of certain monopolies in Persia, which caused goods in transit to be landed at Bahrain instead of Persia. Japanese goods are inferior to British or Indian goods, ana also they are deteriorating in quality as compared with previous imports ~but they rind a sale because they are cheap. Japanese tnem from sell in,, to one purchaser at one price, » and to a second purchaser at a lower price for the same articles. Consequently Bahrain merchants suffer loss by this competition. To illustrate the decline in values I give a comr parison of the prices of cotton, silk/ and arti ficial silk goods. Comparison of values, (per piece) Kature of goods.

Unfortunately biam rice is inferior to Ran oon or Indian rice, ysliicle Licenses. The collections from this source naye^considerably increased owinf to Ine activities of the Bahrain petroleum'Go; ana also many more drivers are now licensed. The practical side of the woric is done by the oolice who are forced to be extremely vigilant to ensure that licenses are duly renewed, since a large number of drivers are Persians, Pearling Lieeuses , The collections from pearling licenses shew a marked decrease in 1353 below those of 135E. This was to be expected from the depression in the pearl trade. Movements of steamers . During the year 1353, one hundred and seventyfour steamers entered and cleared the port, as follows:- British, B.I.S.M, 00*8 steamers 103 Strick-jsllersan line £5 British Tanker Co,Ltd 18 Eastern Steam Hav, Co, 6 152 German Hansa line , 11 Japanese \0n charter) 5 Italian Lloyd Triestino 4 U.6.A. California Standard Oil Go. Inc. T7¥: There were in addition visits by warships of H.B.M's Koyal Navy, the French hepubiican Havy, and the L,T, 'Keerchus' for attention to buoys and lights. The oil tankers of the California Standard Oil Company do not generally bring cargo to Bahrain, but carry the export of oil won by the Bahrain Petrox leum Company, which is duty free. In other^ respects these ships are subject to the usual customs regulations etc. The above steamers brought the following quan tities of cargo:- „ A ...

Total number of packages lanaed 419,130/. iotal number of packages delivered oversides 153,011. in reference to the above, it my be noted tnat the duty-free iaports by the Bahrain Petroleum Company do not now come exclusively by the Hensa Line: but a definite proportion comes via Bombay by the B.I.b.I-.Co^s ships, mile a certain quantity has come forward in the otrick-islleriiian ships. During 1353 there was a freight war between the B.I.D.K.Co.Ltd ana certain Indian steam ship companies which accounted for the visits of the Eastern dteam Navigation Company's ships in the Persian Gulf. This has now ended, and it is unlikely that these ships will visit Bahrain in the coming- year. The Lloyd Triestino steamers visited Bahrain as occasion offered; but I understand that in future there will be regular two monthly calls at this port. These steamers are electrically driven, are manned by Europeans, and have reasonably good passenger accomoda tion. In general tney are superior to the *8' type of steamer of the B.l.o.l.Coy, Ltd. It is also to be noted that both the Lloyd- Trie stino ana the Hensa steamers generally make a good anohorage within the port limits; but the'' British est nek steamers usually anchoi at the outer buoy, which mke the working of their cargoes a dilficultmatter ior their agents, and increases the risk of damage. Ilative Craft. The col lections or re;, is^ra- fion fees upon the native craft show a increase in amount. This aoes not imply that there are more Native Craft in Bahrain in 1353 than in 13S2 — the contrary is the fact, but that owners were slow in their renewals and consequently incurred payment of late fees. At the end of 135E there were registered in Bahrain 1,223 craft of all kinds, including 61 motor launches. At ijhe end oi lob3,uiiere were registered in Bahrain 1,161 craft of all kin^s, including 66 motor craft. Craft whose registrations were not renewed in 1353 are accounted for as follows:-Bahrain sailing craft sold to ocner ^orts 71 Old sailing craft broken up 34 Uj 4 steam launch broken up 1 i 1 m*: orat t- lost a v sea 8 burnt at sea 1 u confiscated in rcrsi^i p wiotor craft confiscated in Persia 1 Total '*118 As an offset aeainst the Bahrain craft sold bo foreign ports, 27 sailing craft and four motor launches were brought to and regis- bered in Bahrain; and^ against the 35 craft broken up, 24 new sailing craft and one motor launch were built locally, and duly registered. The boatbuilding industry is in a state of depression, consequent upon the depression in the pearling industry. The visits of foreign native craft to this port may be compared as follows:- Origin Year 1352 Year 1353. Arabian mainland 610 560 Kuwait 72 Oman Coast 17E 133 Persian coast 3^1 170 ^raq 162 101 India 63 45 Africa 7 7 1,443 1,088 This reduction is somewhat disappointing, as it is important for the well being of many aoor ueople in Bahrain that the native craft traffic should be active, ana so maintain local employment. It is explained to some extent by (1) an increase in steamers» cargoes due to the reduction in the cost of freight by the B.I.o.N.Go., Ltd.. ana (2) certain monopolies declared oy the Iranian Govern- ment having hampered the cross-gulf traffic, and reduced to practically one half. Aiiother factor in connection with the main land traffic is that coasting craft are carry- ine commodities landed at D'bai where there 'is 0 no import duty, and consequently such gooas will be slightly cheaper in cost than if they were landed at Bahrain. For some vears there has been an opinion that native crafts carryin: exports from Bahrain should carry maniiests 01 the ir cargo. It is now thought that the time is ripe for the introduction of this system in Bahrain anao 71 ana it is proposed to initiate it as far as cue iirabian mainland ports of oaoudia-Arabia are concerned with a view to assisting such ports in their prevention or smuggling. But 1 suggest that this procedure must be cau- t lously instituted as the Arab naiihuda (who is illiterate but intelligent) is aot to resent, tma therefore to evade, restrictions or regulations Ahich would hamper his activities. Bahrain native craft export manifests will have to be prepared by the customs on behalf of such naichudas, who will refuse to jay a reason- f'oia faa for same; and if the mainland ports hold the nakhudas to strict responsibility for such manifests, the native craft will visit Bahrain less and less and operate from D'bai and Sharja more and more. It would therefore seem reasonable that if the native craft exporting from Bftlirin are forced to bear cargo janifcsts, thdse export ing fro® D'bai, Siiarja and Kuwait should be under the same obligation, isstablishment. During the uast vear the number clerks employed in uhe Customs department was increased from fifteen to eighteen by the selection, after competition, of three youths from the government schools for training as apprentices, their efforts being mainly devoted to bill writing. Consequently the licensed muqquaama^e system previously in force has beeii abolished. The amount of salaries drawn was Bs 26,416/- which is greater than last year on account of automatic increases in pay. The number of naturs employed was £4 and the total wages paid to them was Rs 8,831/-. There were 5,803 i^ills of ibntry dealt with, in addition to the usual records and the statistical woric, which is up to date, general . The past year has been one of steady wo nun', with no unusual developments. The department is by no means over-statied; and the changes in procedure foreshadowed in 11504, viz,, the expected increase in oversides delivery cargo, and the institution of export manifests tor native craft will probably entail an addition of at least three more clerks, 'fHili customs premises are in a bad state oi dis- repair as money for necessary work could not be x soared durin the past three years- and a lar*e sum . ill have to be expended m the n^ar future. The most urgent isatters are the renews J of the Trolley-line system, Tshich had worked well for ten years, and the repainting of the warehouses which are suffering badly from climatic erosion. In this connection it may be remembered that the creation of a sinking fund was recommended in lyE4: and earlier than that a small charge, known as Pier fees, was instituted upon Import car o the proceeds to be devoted to the main tenance and extension of the customs pier which-10- 72 4 vmiCii ou t nt to be twice its present length uo be indepenaent of the tides. Tiie col- iec bions from this source during the past six years have a; regaled to % 135,241/- or say an aTera* e of 1% £2,540/- per year, which sriouici more than cover the cost of maintenance and repairs of customs premises. I there- lore suggest that uhe time is now suitable ior the creation of this sinking fund. *)ir oomimMTiM.* -*0* 1935.

Sir, I have the honour to forward for your informa tion a statement of revenue and expenditure for the first six months of the current year. 2. The revenue is 'Rs 13,500/- leas than during the corresponding period of last year and it is % 16,000/- less than the n ount v doh was estimated in the 3u%et. j.lit- cxl ..nui«ure exceouS thcj 4 v -.nUt by approximately n 3 6,000/- . 3, This deficiency is because no payisant has yet been received froz the Bahrain Petrolema Company on account of royalties on oix. Li tae Bna£.et ma estimated that ~ 1,66,000/- would be paid by the conpany to the rovernssent on account of royalties during- the current year. ^ne anount ^iion is due to the ; overnsent after deducting one third which is payable to the Ruler's Civil List and after refunding the pxo port ion of the loan which ^as idaue to the govern- me ii t ♦ •U ' Ecverwmtii by the company, is ' 68,540/-. The royalty due from ahipiiants made by the company during the second, half g£. year of 19b6 already exceeds the sua due from the first half year oy a considerable amount* In addition to this it is possible that . • i. .

The expenditure and revenue under the various] headings do not differ greatly from the estimated aaoun'is* Tie i i- ires for the first six months however are not in all cases a sure in ication of the following; six months, the revenue increases and decreases durin certain seasons and many of the payments v- iieh are made to the govern- sent are not spread equally over the twelve jonths of the year. Apart from oil revenue I aa of the opinion thai tha amounts estiimted for under tae various head in,; 3 ill ba oLl sined by ohe end of the year and it is possible that there may be a s.jall surplus from sources other than oil.

It mil be observed that the Civil List during the first half of yedr of lo54 amounts to Hs 2,01,180/- ami the total revenue for this period is % 3,84,029/-.

From : - To:- Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C•I.P », Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Restoration of cut in salaries of Bahrain Government officials. ^ A'n 77&gt;. fvj 1 0. '1 - X//. U : i, Sir, dafe.-j _ liifideitie record With reference to our conversation on the 22nd November 1935, I have the honour to inform you that the Bahrain Govern ment propose to restore the reductions in the pay of Bahrain Government servants, amounting to Rs.800/- a month, and the reductions in payments made under the Civil List, amounting to Rs .5,830/- a month, all of vAiich were made in connection with the drastic economies in the budget of the Bahrain Government necessitated by the financial depression of recent years. The total to be restored is roundly Rs.55,000/- a year. 2. Owing to the payment of the first royalties on oil, it is known that there will be a surplus in the current year and it is confidently expected that there will be a large surplus in succeeding years. There is now no doubt of the existence of oil in large quantities and, as The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited are engaged on an urgent extension of their drilling activities and are pressing on hastily with the building of a refinery in Bahrain, it is reasonable to suppose /that,1^ 2» that the Company hope to produce on a large scale. Even if inarketlng difficulties should temporarily supervene, the minimum sum payable annually under the Mining Lease is Rs.l50,00( 3. I am strongly of opinion that the reduction in the pay of the Bahrain Government servants should be restored forthwith. They are not too well paid and accepted with grace the curtail ing of their pay to meet an emergency, and they were told at the time that their full pay would be restored to them when the emergency was over. The emergency has now passed and it is most desirable that the restoration of the old rates of pay should be made by the Bahrain Government of their own volition rather than that it should be wrung from them by an agitation, with which all would sympathize. 4. The restoration of the reductions in the Civil List is on a rather different footing, but I am also strongly in favour of it for other reasons. A great many of the bene ficiaries have very small portions, which can hardly sustain reductions save as a measure of emergency. The reductions were accepted without serious trouble by the Ruling Family because it was impressed upon them that there was in truth, an emergency and because they saw similar reductions made in the pay of rJ Bahrain Government servants and also in the pay of British V ! Government servants. They grumble already and will certainly not understand, the restoration of the old rate of pay to these two classes and not to themselves. Moreover, with large oil royalties coming In, the failure to restore their reductions will be a constant and sore grievance, and will be regarded (as, indeed. It would be) as simply due to the British Govern ment and to no onedse. For cogent political reasons we should /avoid\ / V 3. avoid antagonising the Ruling Family on whose goodirill our position and policy (Naval Base, Air Route arrangements and so on) is built up. 5* I venture, moreover, to think that we should not impose too rigidly upon Bahrain our own, very alien, ideas of (what I may term) constitutional finance. It is but a few years since the Shaikhs took all they could extract from people; today there is a properly drawn up budget to which the Bahrain Government strictly adhere. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 1 Isa A1 Khalifah has accepted the principle (though it is by no means firmly established as yet) of dividing the oil royalties in a proportion of one-third to the Ruler and his Family and two-thirds to the Bahrain Government, and if the Ruling Family can point to a grievance over the reductions in their allowances, it will make it harder to establish this principle. I do not think that we should be well advised to press for further self- denial by the Ruling Family. After all, our interest in the finances of the Bahrain State is confined (a) to not having to come to its rescue with, (b) to seeing that enough money is allocated to the Bahrain Government (as opposed to the Ruling Family) to ensure a reasonable standard of administi*&amp;.tion and to build up a reserve for the future. These considerations are being fulfilled (the reserve has, indeed, already been restored and will be increased) and I, therefore, recommend that, having safeguarded the needs of the administration in the important matter of the division of royalties, we should avoid, firstly, drawing upon ourselves the odium which must inevitably attach to preventing a restoration of the reductions maae to meet a past emergency and, secondly, providing our enemies with /a perfect4. a perfect advertisement of British interference in the ad minis- tration. 6. I am anxious that the Bahrain Government should move in the matter before any popular clamour arises and should be grateful, therefore, if I might be given instructions as soon as possible. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. gut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain,GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. • D epaimment.

Dated, R/Awal, 2, 1355 May 22, 1936 The Adviser to the Gove rumen, t of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty 's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information the Budget for the State of Bahrain for the year 1355 and a report on the revenue and expenditure during 1354. This is the eleventh Budget which I have had the honour to present. The annual report on the adminis tration of Bahrain which normally accompanies the Budget is not yet complete. It will be forwarded at a later date. The Administration Report is written almost entirely by myself and owing to pressure of work I have not been acle to finish it. 2. Budget . The expenditure shown in the Budget represents the recurrent expendi ture necessary for the normal protection, administration —administration and running of the State. The expenditure for 1355 is estimated at lis 43,000/- more than the corresponding expenditure during 1354 owing to the restoration of outs and increased expenditure in certain services. The anticipated revenue from all sources other than oil royalty is not at present sufficient to cover the normal annual expenditure, Is 280,000/- oil royalty, is included in the Budget. In addi tion to the usual Budget a supplementary Budget has been mde providing for the expenditure of Bs 1,64,000/- from the surplus at the close of the year 1354 after transferring 2,OQp0O/- (two lacs) to the Reserve Fund. Revenue . Oustoms receipts, 's S, 00,000/-. Although in the past financial year there has undoubtedly been an improvement in trade, yet the revenue from customs duties, boat and pearl ing licenses is estistated curing tine ne% year at not more than 6,^^,0110/— Bs 20,000/- more than'the amount shown 'under this heading in tie 1354 Budget, and b 91,000/- less iiiisii 'fcii© fictus.! £iiiouii% oo lioctsci m u^xxi^, to the reduction in the R.i. duty and the continued depression in the pearl trade vhioh affects the vield from boat and pearl taxes, 1 ha-re not con sidered it wise to assume that aore tnan six lacs will he collected. ty on oil . &amp; 2,30,0v0/-. 'i'bis sum represents the royalty due to the State on oil whioh has been shipped since the last payment of royalty by the Bahrain Petroleum Company until the end of the year 1354. It represents revenuerevenue from oil for three months. Undoubtedly tue royalty on oil will be greatly in excess of this figure. Only one payment will be mde by hiie oompany to the State during the year 1355, tiie next payment is due in September and the following payment is due at the end of March, probably after the end of the Arabic year 1355. The remaining items of revenue which amount to Pis bv,000/- do not call for any special comment, 1 have estimated the total revenue from these sources at a slightly higher figure than in the 1354 Budget. expenditure . Payments to the Ruling Family. An increase of h 44,000/- in the Civil List is owing to the restoration of the 12ir$ cut which was made in 1350. One third of the oil royalty is paid into the privy purse of the Ruler. The sum which will be received by him will be very much larger than the amount shown in the Budget. State Protection. Is 1 ,40,000/-. This item includes the cost of maintaining the State Police force, which has been increased during the last year and which is likely to be further increased during 1355, the naturs, prison adminis tration and the salaries of Amirs. The amount allocated to State Protection is Is 15,000/- more than was budgeted last year. rwrnnTitmnt deo artiaents. Bs 1,58,000/-. This item is increased by approximately Hs 15,000/- more than was budgeted in lb54 owing to the restoration of the 10^ cut on the salaries of —-4~ 01 all b-ovanuflent employees, provision for several additional magistrates and Kadis and a slight increase in the clerical staff. Municipalities. h 50,000/-. The two municipal councils, Manamali and Kmiarraq, used eacii to receive a monthly subsidy of Bs 2,000/- from the Govermaent. In 1350, owing to the need for urgent economy, these subsidies were reduced by 10$. Now that State finances have improved the subsidies have been restored to the original amount and in addition 1% 2,400/- has been provided for work in the town of Hedd. This money will be spent by the Muharraq. Municipal Council in Hedd. Medical Services, Education. Contingencies and Public .iorks . The allocation under these headings is approximately the same as in the last Budget. Medical services includes the State's contributions to the pay of the Quarantine Medical Officer, the upkeep of the Muharraq dis pensary and the pay of the Indian doctor. Public vorks consists of upkeep and repairs to existing government buildings but it does not include any BB-jor new i/orks. 3. fnfi Supplementary Budget . Anti Malarial aeasures. On completion of the financial year the State had a surplus balance of Rs 4,75,000/- and a Reserve Imdof Bs 2,00,000/-. the surplus balance Ks 2,00,000/- was transferred to the Reserve fund bringing it up to four lacs. from the remainder it is proposed to spend Is —-5- 1 ,64,000/- on special projects and the regain ing Is 1,11,000/- will he set aside for unfor- seen expenditure or to be expended later in the year by another Supplementary Budget. The anti-malarial measures provided for in the Budget consist of draining and filling in areas containing stagnant mosquitoe breeding water. These measures are in addition to the spraying with oil which is now being carried out by the Police and Municipal authorities. The sewer at Hedd is a long filthy drain running through the centre of the town which is probably the cause of much of the fever in that place. The channel, which is wide, will be filled in and made into a much needed road. The two ponds, one north west of the fort, the other near the Juma mosque at Jedhafs contain stagnant water which increases and diminishes according to the amount oi rain. Last year the Man amah municipality, thougii Tory short of funds, spent Ss 4,OCX)/- in filling in some of the water pits south of the town. This year the GoTernaent can afford to assist the municipality in continuing this useful vrork. jhg money spent on these scneKies 'ill all b« spent locally on labour and stone. The muni cipalities will be asked by the GoTOrmaent to uniertake most of this wore:. lical . Dntil now the Government of Bahrain has spent comparatively little on medical work the bulk of which has been carried out by the —-6- tho ^erioan Medical Missionaries and tbe quarantine Medical Officer. There is a very strong feeling among the Arabs that the Bahrain u-ovemiient should have its own hospital and meaical staff. The question is under consi deration and when funds are available doubtless a Government hospital will be started. In the meantime the G-overniaent proposes to open dis pensaries, which will be run on the lines of the Govermaent dispensary in Muharraq, in various places in Bahrain. A dispensary for woiaen and children is to be opened on the western quarter of Manamah, on the edge of the town which it is hoped will be used not only by the people of Manamah but by the people from the near villages such as Meni, Zinj, etc. An Iraqi voman who has worked as a nurse in the Basrah hospital will be put in charge of this dispensary. A dispensary will be opened in Hedd in a building which was acquired by the Government some years ago. A local Arab with considerable medical experience who lias worked for the Govern ment on previous occasions will be employed as a dispenser. A similar dispensary is to be opened at Bilad- al-^adim, whicii is a fairly central position. rn|jQ Q0f© ruins lit is s.dvsr't ising m lE.di&amp; tor &amp; suitable mn to oarry out this work.

All the dispensaries and the medical workera — ■Vi H • ■ ^ v'workers will be under the supervision of the Quarantine Medical Officer. Mucation. Two siaall country schools are to be opened, one at Sit rah and one at Burri. rnese schools will satisfy the demands of the Shias who complain, with some justification, that while ^overninent schools have been estab lished in the towns which are mostly Sunni the educational needs of the Shia community have not been provided for. Only reading writing and si simple arithmetic mil be tau^hifin the country schools. Efforts are being made to introduce technical instruction in the lianamah and Muharraq boys 1 schools. There is today in Bahrain a great demand for carpenters and mechanics and if boys could learn wrk of this kind at the schools it would be of more practical use to them than the type of education which they are getting now. Provi si on has been made for the possibility of sending six more boys from the Government schools to Bey rout University. Public lorks . A new custom house including a flat for the customs Director is to be built on the shore opposite the open space facing the north end of the Barrett road. The present building is in a dangerous state of disrepair. Originally it was badly built on reclaimed ground and evi dently the foundations were not carried down to the bed rock. It has constantly been repaired mth no permanent success. offices are dark \ andand incoLvenient and the building is oversha- do¥fed by the high new buildings which have sprung up around it. The accomodation in the new building for the public and the staff will be almost double that available in the old office. Barrack room. A second barrack room similar to the one which was made two years ago is to be built in the Fort. These two rooms will accomodate all the men who are normally quartered there. The old rooms now occupied by the Police are in a bad state of repair. The main wall of the Fort, which is made of mud and stones frequently collapses and needs immediate attention. Palace wall . A wall is to be built in front of the Palace enclosing a large square on the north of the building, ornamental trees will be planted at the south west and south east comers flanking the building and there will be gates at the corners of the wall. By these means the approach to the palace will be improved and it will no longer present an appearance of isolated ugliness. Shoo and office . A shop and an office are to be built on the corner of Prior road and Barrett road behind the present customs house. ifarmTORh Mnharraa road . It is propes ed that within the first half of the year this road will be completed as far as the deep channel. The amount allowed for completion of this work is more than will be required, the balance will be used in the beginning to fill in the channel, one of the advantages —-9- aavantages of this scheme is that all the money- is spent loo ally. 4. The revenue of Bahrain in 1354 has onoe again readied the level which it was ten years ago and not for a long time has the State completed a year with such a satisfactory surplus. I think it can now be reasonably assumed that the lean years have passed and that a period of financial prosperity is beginning. Neither now nor at any time during the anxious period of financial depression has this State incurred financial liabilities such as loans. In the time of prosperity a Reserve Fund wis started and when in spite of all efforts and drastic economies the revenue was insufficient to cover the expendi ture the Reserve fund was drawn upon in order to carry on the normal administration of the country. 5, The new prosperity is from the royalty on oil, without this royalty it would still be impossible to balance the Budget ano, to pay for the administration of the country. Oil is an uncertain factor and its production depends not only on the available supply but on the world markets. I consider that it is more essential now than it has ever been before to build up a really large reserve which besides providing a steady income will be available if for any reason the production of oil is restricted and the revenue from oil dwindles to the minimum royalty which is all-10- is all that the .Bahrain Petroleum Company are ooliged under all cirouiostanoes to jay to the State, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Enclos:- Acviser to the Government.iiotes on revenue 1354. xjiG L-ott-l revenue in 1354 exceeded the revenue of the previous year by Bs 4,55,000/- although there was included in the 1353 revenue Hs 1,10,000/- which was biie price of the land sold to the British Government.

Sir, In continuation of my lettej/Mo. 328/SF dated May 22, 1936, enclosing copy of the Budget for the State of Bahrain for the year 1355, I enclose herewith report and statement of accounts for the year 1354, in connection with the working of the Bahrain Governmait Electric Supply Department. I have the honour to he, Sir, lour most ohe-dient servant, rser to thq GovernmentBahrain Electric Supply, year 1354. The current consumption for the year 1354 shows an increase of 15,991 units over 1353. This is due to extra connected load amounting to approximately E7 kilowatts. The nature of the new load is as follows: - Lighting 30E points, app. 18 kw. Fans — 33 points ' 3 kw. Miscellaneous, (table fans, refrigerators etc.) 11 6 kw. Total — 27 kilowatts. Revenue from connected load during 1354 was Us 43,827/12 and for 1353 was Rs 36,797/-, an increase of Ps 7,030/12/-. Sixty new premises have been wired during the year, in Lanamah, 56 and in Luharraq., 4. Total consuiaers connected to date 614. Maximum load recorded — 1 ^4.4 kw. Total kilowatts connected to end of year, 223. ,irinp: contracts . It will be observed that sixty premises were wired in 1354 as compared with 65 in 1353, but the total number of points wired was greater in 1354. The revenue from wiring contracts in 1354 was in excess of all previous years, but only a slight profit is made from wiring, as the main object is to promote the sale of energy, by keeping the cost per point wired, as low as possible. In addition to the extra lighting and fan (and refiigerator) load, the Jufair Kaval Base has been added to the system. An overhead, 3 phase, 400 volt —400 volt line has been run from 'D' substation (Shaikh Hamad * s palace at Gadhabia) to the Base a distance of approximately 1.8 miles. The average Base load should be, during the sumioer months, approximately 12.5 kw. The installa tion of the v /ater supply system, both general and. domestic, has been carried out by this Department, Water is being electrically pumped from tvo existing wells, to hi^i level tanks for distribution. A land telegraph line has been run by this Department from the Gable House of Gable and Wireless Ltd. , near Jabala to their Main Station at Hura to connect the submarine cable from Bushire with the .dreless Station. Temnorary .dring . During 1354 the c ities of Manamah and Muharraq, were especially illuminated on two occasions. Once to celebrate His Majesty King George * s Silver Jubilee, and once for the anniversary of the accession of His Jixcellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain. On each occasion, some 1500 extra light points were temporarily installed. Mnpimoal Ice Plant . fhe Municipal ice plant was operated by the Department as usual during 1354 ftyyj r an for five and half months continuously* The output of ice was one hundred and sixty tons. A new one ton ice plant (with one ton storage capacity) has been ordered from England and will be installed by this department on arrival in the Spring of 1936. It will be erected in an annexe to the —to the present power station. . Public Telepliones . During the year the telephone systems of Manamah and Muharraq have been connected to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, a connecting line having run between the Manamah exchange and the New Gamp of the Bahrain Petro leum Company, a distance of approximately twelve miles. The present Government exchange is loaded to capacity, and a new extension switch board, of 16 line capacity has been ordered and will be installed during 1355. Transmission and Line losses . Transmis si on losses amounted to 9.66^ of the total energy generated during 1354 as compared with 13.75$ during 1353. This is due largely to the higher power factor obtained during the winter months, the lighting demand having increased. financial position . It will be seen from the annual balance sheet that a profit of Rs 4,819/10/10 was made by the Department after meeting all charges, including depreciation and insurance. This is due to increased revenue from energy sold, larger sales of sundry material, wiring, and other contracts. It might be ment ioned that the charges against this department for the year 1354 included the sum of Rs 1,450/- paid to the Bahrain Customs as duty on material imported. Prospects for 1355 . It is reasonable to assume that the revenue from energy sold will increase-4- inorease during 1355, as the following extra connected load has been obtained, to date, 1. New one ton ice plant — 5 kw 2. Jufair Naval Base 18 kw 3. Printing press,(Manama) 4 kw 4. New wireless station. {Gable k .ireiessLtd) - 2 kw. It is also anticipated that the lighting load will increase at a higher rate than during previous years, as more money is circulating in the State, and the latter is growing rapidly from a commercial point of view. It is expected that, towards the end of 1355, the load will be sufficient to absorb the whole of the output of one set and part of the standby set. Preliminary tenders for a new generating set and switchgear have been asked for.CONFIDENTIAL.

From The Adviser to the Governraeat of Bahraia, To # * i ^ His Bnt^faaic 'ajesty's Political ^@at, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information a statement of Revenue and Expenditure for the first six months of the current year, 1355. Z. The revenue is 53,403/- more than during the corresponding period of last year, and is Is. 31,068/- less than the amount which was estimated in the budget for six months. The expenditure exceeds the revenue by i.. l,04,iVo/- 3. 'he deficiency is because the payment by the Bahrain Pet role us. -wonpany on account of royalty on oil was not re ceived before the end of this half year. This payment was credited by the ; astern Sank Limited on 30th September, 1936, but the cheque was actually received on Ist October, 1936. In the budget it was estimated that .u. 2,d0,00U/- would be ^aid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on a /o qj l «!* 'ti 3j8^l~-. ,account of royalties during the whole of the current year. The actual amount paid by the Company ( after the first six j oni h's of the year had expired ) is k. C,92.22H/-. Out of this amount s. 2,30,740/- is payable to The Ruler *s Civil List being his one third share of royalties. Thus the royalty paid on account of shipments made by the Company until end of 30th une , 1936, considerably exceeded the estimated amount for the whole year. It is expected that there will be further shipments of oil during the second half year of 1355. 4. The revenue from Customs exceeded the estimated amount in the oudget by h. 1,05,130/-. This includes .. j , 31,444/- collected from 'earling Licenses ./hich was paid during the diving season, so it can not be presume that the second half of the year will be equally productive. 5. The revenue under various headings sometimes differs from the estimated amounts. The figures for the first half year are not in all cases an equivalent indication of the following six months, because some sources cf revenue are seasonal. Apart from oil revenue it can be presumed that the amounts estimated for under various headings will oe collected by the end of the year. 6. The expenditure for the first six months amounted, to ,. 5,42,30//- whicn-3- which is Es. 1, bz , o25/- niors than during the corresponding period of last year; and it is Ks. 73,607/- more than the amount allowed for in the original budget, but includes Rs. 90,211/- spent on schemes and works under ,, SUPPLEMSH r : - 1' budget. The estimated expenditure unaer supple mentary budget is .s. 1,64,000/- for the current year, 7. The Civil List during the first half of year 1355 amounted to Ks 2,23,321/- which was lis. 35,179/- less than the budgeted amount and represents 51 ,3 of the total revenue. 8. The amount spent on account of His Excellency The Ruler's visit to England will be made up after the Adviser' return. I have the honour to be. 3M'73 , 3. n lni . Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th November 1956. Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain. BAHRAIN STATE. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the policy to be pursued by the Bahrain Government in using 11 / 4 i their revenue from oil royalties. 2. Now that oil has been wo in considerable quantities ^ and that a refinery has been establisned in Banrain (c.nd is being extended), it is safe to infer that tne Bahrain Petroleum Company intend to work their concession in earnest 1 and that a large yearly sum will accrue to the Bahrain Government in royalties for some time to come. One third of the total royalties is handed to the Shaikh for the A1 Khalifah family and two thirds go into the revenue of the Bahrain Government. It cannot, however, in the nature of things be expected that the revenue from oil royalties will continue for more than a limited period. The supply of oil in the field may diminish and will someday in any case fail: and conditions of the market may change. It is essential that the- Bahrain Government should face this fact from tne outset. pglal. No.C/430, ^ u Fromin : - 2 - 3. The best opinion obtainable Is to the effect that the pearl trade Is likely to improve, but never to reach again its old great prosperity, so that it is not safe for the Bahrain Government to count on any great revenue from pearls in the future. 4. The first step that is necessary in order to safe guard the future is to build up a solid reserve, which will then automatically increase as the years go by. The process has already been begun, and the total amount to be accumulated as a reserve will be considered separately. 5. There are ; iso certain important measures for the '• betterment of the people, such as the anti-malaria campaign, sanitation and water supply in Manamah and Maharraq, education, - ym. irrigation and so on, for which money will no doubt be allotted in the ordinary course of administration. 6. But all these activities (and, indeed, the continuance^ of the reserve) depend on the revenue from oil royaloies, ano. provision must be made for the days when it fails. 7. Whatever else may be an immediate source of wealth, ultimately it is on the land that mankind depends for existence. 8. The A1 Khalifah have a wise custom that land- belonging to members of the A1 Khalifah can only oe alienated j to another member of the family. Some of them, being feckless! and extravagant, do their best to evade this ruxe ana some wish to sell for sound reasons. Recently, therefore, a Committee consisting of Shaikh Ifchammad bin 'Isa, Shaikh t Abdullah bin tisa and ^haikh Salman bin Hamad was established,; to consider cases in which members of the A1 Khalifah wish to I sell land to persons not of the Al Khalifah Family. The Committee report to the Ruler, who may or may not follow their advice.- 3 - advice. The Political Agent tries to influence all in the direction of retaining the land in the Family. 9. From time to time I have discussed with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government the possibility of the Bahrain Govern- ment intervening in such cases (if it were thought desirable to do so in order to save any particular piece of land) and buying the land. The ownership would then vest in the Bahrain Government, as opposed to the A1 Khalifah as a family, and the Government would administer it. Till now it has not been possible to develop the idea owing to lack of funds. 10. I suggest that this system of buying by the Bahrain Government might now be adopted and extended to land, other than that of the A1 Khalifah, which may from time to time come into the market, if it can be obtained at a reasonable figure. 11. The effect in time would be to make the Bahrain Govern ment a considerable landowner and to ensure a new and more or less permanent source of revenue for itself and of employment and good food for its people, when and if the revenue from oil follows that from the pearl trade. 12, At one time the Bahrain Government had in their employ a Director of Agriculture, a Syrian, who did good work so far as was permitted by the meagre funds at his disposal. The post had to be done away with during the recent financial crisis, but the Adviser has under consideration the question of reviving it, no?# that money xs availc-ible. I x^ould recommend that the appointment should be made and a strong agricultural staff be collected to deal with agriculture in general and with the Bahrain Government lands in particular. 13. There is much room for improvement in date farming and agriculture, and for the introduction of new fruits and vegetables, and I would like to see agriculture and cow, sheep andsheep and goat farming administered together, with a view to building up a better diet for the people, I do not think that there is anything into which the Bahrain Government could better put their money. 14. Examples of the possibilities are (a) that about six years ago the idea of using manure for the date gardens was tried for the first time and is now widely used (so far as manure is available); (b) that oranges introduced into the Shaikh's gardens from 'Iraq have borne fruit in a way which suggests that an industry could be started, which would add oranges to the local dietj and {c) that tobacco growing has been started and it is known that cotton can be grown. 15. I recommend, therefore, that the Bahrain Government should be advised to adopt as a policy;- (i) the purchase of land, both of the A1 Khalifah (when compelled to sell by poverty or other good cause) and of ordinary owners as suitable opportunities offer and (ii) that a Directorate of Agriculture be re-established '^&gt;%&gt;i»iiMiwi»i&gt;iili l V&lt;linrrll&lt;&lt;iiltiwii,l»iniinwiiiiwniBMTfwiiWii I ^ ^ „ and charged (a) with the administration of the Bahrain Government lands either themselves or through suitable tenants, (b) with the improvement of agriculture (including date trees and introduction of new lines and (c) with the improvement of animals giving meat and milk (cows, goats, sheep, poultry). 16. I would add that I have discussed this proposal informally with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Mr. C.D. Belgrave, C.B.E.), who cordially agrees with it in principle. We both appreciate that the most careful organisation and the gradual building up of a first class staffhi - 5 - staff will be necessary if success is to 'be achieved, but before placing the matter before His Excellency ShaiMi Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah or taking any other action, I should be glad of your general approval, I have the honour to be.

Some years ago, when the Bahrain Government wished to discover what the possibilities of their customs revenue might be and to reorganize their Customs Department, they procured an expert of the Indian Customs Service, who visited Bahrain for a short period, and on whose report the Bahrain Government took action with very profitable results. 4. on the same analogy the first step in the present instance seems to me, before the Bahrain (Joyernment begin to purohose land, which may or may not be oultivahle, and before any directorate of Agriculture is established, ..hich may or may not be ororth its expenditure, it would be as veil to obtain the advice of a first class agricultural expert, who should visit Bahrain for a month or t«o and draw up a detailed report on what local possibilities there are. men this /-2- this is ascertained the Bahrain Government will then be in a position to take useful action. 5.

But fhe G of I only suggest and as long as the reserve is built up,I do not think that they will mind how we do it. The idea contains possible germs of a compromise if we find that we want to throw a little hit extra to the Sha kh and the A1 Khalifah as opposed to the Shaikh alone. s t''' 24.7.34 j ^ S ccao hi</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000146_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/353</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000146</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/353</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 19/176 IV (C 71) Bahrain Finances'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (203 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.
