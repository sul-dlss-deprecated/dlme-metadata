I do not get Reuters myself but only part of the British Official Press broadcasted daily from Rugby and taken down by a local owner of a receiving set. It does not give much. As for telegraphing items of interest, in these days of financial stringency telegraphing has to be reduced to a minimum. Items of news likely to be of interest to you will be posted to you as soon as possible.

With reference to recent rumoura of the defeat of Ibh Saud’s forces In NEJUAJT, which, according to your reports, have been prevalent in Bahrain and Kuwait.

Copies of these (which should be serially numbered to facilitate reference) could be sent to me, bu'f need not be sent to Minister,t T edda, who gets your Monthly Summaries.

I had already started to do this before I cane to Bushire,but it is not an easy business nowadays.for two reasons. Jne reason is that the Political Agent is completely out ol touch with Ibn Jiluwi and the ’Amirs of Qatif and ’O-air, and the former appears determined that heither he nor his ’Amirs shall have any relations with the Political Agent. Other people from those parts act accordingly. The other reason is that the Political Agent is kept so busy with petty work,which must be done and cannot be delegated (there is no one to delegate it to,except the Incian Assistant who is wholly occupies by Court work),that he cannot see people as he ought. I was aghast,when 1 returned here,to find how out ol touch the Political Agent had become. I have tried to rid mysell ol as much as possible,and to encourage visits from the Shaikh and his relations,and so on,as their information is far more valuable,as a rule,than anything one can buy. 3 . «ly experience of paid information in Bahrain is not encouraging,but I think that there is one direction m which I could usefully employ a regular (and not very large) payment. I would rather give you details,if I may,when you are here next. 4. I entirely agree about the importance,especially in view of the possible ^and inevitable) future,of our getting The Honourable /better Lieut-Colonel T.C.fi.Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,Bushire.6 2 . better into touch with the mainland,and will do all 1 can to help to that end.
