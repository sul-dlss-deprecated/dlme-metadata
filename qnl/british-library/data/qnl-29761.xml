The prospects of so large a pilgrimage were viewed 3de with grave misgivings by the Saudi Arabian Government, on the score that there was barely sufficient food* money and transport available for the internal needs of the country. _ . r: . i Jioevr .anooes ©hi noillha mol 3. It was on these grounds, and the real fear of the lack of adequate shipping facilities, that His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires based his suggestion to His Majesty's Government that the pilgrimage should be restricted in numbers in the interests of all concerned. isoxlqcs bn* tliihl IsAoitfqo ^olfw/Xoni eeub e^amiT^Ixq ixedt vb&lt;j 4« Than came the news of the sinking of the Mogul Line steamer 'Rahmani' by enemy action off the Island of Socotra* closely followed by the Government of India's decision to cancel the Indian pilgrimage. This action iiy the Government of India was immediately seized upon by Axis propagandists to refute the British claim to have replaced the bulk of the shipping lost by enemy actioa* -v 10 63 oxe Meanwhile, JMr. Jordan, His Majesty's Minister, who was in Cairo, had discussed the various aspects of the problem with.the responsible authorities in Bgypt and strongly advocated, on both political and economic grounds, that every effort should be made to provide facilities for as large a pilgrimage as possible. :_js «©G erli To e di lo iXua&amp; x s as *^ie^Bl }ie©w a .A* o. To ensure the success of so large a pilgriiaage as was then envisaged, the urgent problems of finance, food supplies, motor transport and shipping had to f be solved. , ^he most pressing of these was the question of finance. The Saudi Government claimed there was insufficient silver coinage (Riyals)(Riyals) in circulation W provide for th« country's internal needs and that in the circumstances it would be impossible for the money changers to procure the necessary additional Riyals to effect the exchange of the national currencies brought in by the pilgrims. soo Crf sli'i eeiuco lo Jne unevt naiinerfnl 7• Although in considerable doubt as to the correctness of the Saudi Government's claim His Majesty's Minister maid urgent representations to His Majesty's Government who arranged for four million Riyals to be minted in India and an additional four million in the United Kingdom subject to the immediate replacement of the silver from Uhited States Lend-Lease sources. Of the total of eight million Riyals four million were promised to‘be ready for delivery by the third week in September and the remaining four million by the second week in October. edi lo isel Xse*i eirf b.- : \ , ee-.errf no aaw il .C o. An additional'safeguard against an unreasonable appreciation of the Riyal in terms of sterling-area currencies, as a consequence of a heavy demand for Riyals or gold, was the adoption and application of a scheme whereby pilgrims were required to pay their pilgrimage dues including optional tariff items, in their country of origin, i.e. in currency within the Sterling area. The pilgrimage tariff and Hejaz entrance tax, which-are fixed in Riyal si were collected from the pilgrims at an agreed exchange rate of Riyals 13 1/3 to £1.1 sterling. To provide for casual expenditure in Saudi Arabia, pilgrims were permitted and even encouraged to purchase sovereigns, up-^to a maximum of ten per head, at the market‘rate. The Saudi Government 5 undertook to exchange these sovereigns at a guaranteed rate of Riyals 40 per sovereign. In the event, 'sufficient Riyals becane available on the money market in anticipation of the arrival, some weeks later, of the newly-minted Riyals from India. i’ioTle 'yiere fx. :i$ , bnuoi • . . -ago© hi s :i 5 oc no 9* Tb© exchange rates on the local market at the end of September were: Riyals 37 = £.gold 1; Riyals 7 = £.2.1; Riyals 5i/5i = £*P*1* A week later, as a result of the rumours of the impending arrival of Riyals from India, the Riyal shafply &lt; depreciated: Riyals = £.gold 1; Riyals 8£ = £.E.l; Riyals 6£/7 « £•?•!• ‘Moreover, it was learned from a senior Saudi Government official that some eight million Riyals had been t * collected/collected in the Hasa Province and werp stored at Riyadh for \ immediate transfer, to the Heja? if required^Qx-rcoI sdcf amd^O , 10. Arrangements were made with the middle Eas.t Supply Centre to provide and expedite the shipment of additional food supplies for the use of pilgrims. 20 tons of tea r 350 tons of sugar, 2,000 tons of wheat and $06 tons, of flour arrived at Jedda in good time and were distributed, under the jOjint supervision of Major Harrison, the' British Middle East Supply C Centre representative in Jedda and of the Saudi Arabian Government, to Government controlled retailers at JefLda, Mecca and Medina, who sold to pilgrims at controlled prices. A reserve of all commodities - 4 tons of tea, 66 tons of sugar, 410 tons of wheat and 226 tons of flour - held at Jedda remained untouched at the end of the pilgrimage. .3. .elJ eiii do:-.. ... . jv-. see.U lo a*. , .y-i heix/osxeposition with regard to internal transport gave cause for some anxiety, but the timely prrival of spares and tyres from Egypt and Eritrea, enabled the Arab Gar Company to operate a far larger number of vehicles than was at first, considered possible. The position was further eased by the addition of Saudi Arabian Government vehicles, including the private cars of His Majesty and those of his sons. The only complaints regarding lack of transport facilities emanated from Egyptian pilgrims who were not, as usual, willing to adhere to the rota system. They desired and demanded priority, which was not granted. , ^ sent .3'.aju\c:li lo .ioii£ iioqsrart edi idt enij XairiheXi e.iJ 12, Shipping facilities were adequate during the incoming period before the pilgrimage, and all pilgrims arrived in good time for Arafat.

In spite of this, over 5*000 Persian pilgrims were reported to have gathered at Kbweit and to be offering fabulous sums for lorry-hire. In the event, a considerable number actually arrived in this way at Mecca, the majority of them owing solely to the magnanimous help extended to them by His Majesty/Majesty who sent cars, which ha could ill spare, to rescue them when the lorries*, as expected, broke down, , 14« Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhul Hajjah, fell on Monday, Deoeaiber 6th, 1943* The concourse at Jrafat was in the neighbourhood of 80,000 souls of whom approximately 35*000 had travelled by sea* The remainder were Saudi Arabs', Iraqis, Persians, Yemenis, Palistinians and others who had ^ travelled by overland routes. * naida'iA erii *lo bus tibbel ni evi^einsr ei'iei en^neO 15* Only one unfortunate incident marred an- otherwise harmonious pilgrimage and this was due to religious animosity • between the Shia and Sunni sects.

This was more difficult this year as all overseas pilgrims had to pay tariff items and taxes of the Saudi Arabian Government in their country of origin. The mutawwifs further enriched themselves by attempting to obtain in return for bribes preferential treatment for pilgrims who wished to embark earlier than they were entitled to under the rota : system# (8) PILGRIMAGE TARIFF . _ . .’v.(s In raising the tariff by 25 per cent over previous years, the Saudi authorities explained that they had to do it in view oi the rise in price of all necessities, e;g# foodstuffs, tyres, tubes etc. In past years, a reduction of 25 per cent used to be granted by the authorities on the published tariffs# This year the usual 25 per cent reduction was not granted. Consequently, the net tariff was increased by 66 2/3 per cent. Saudi authorities fixed the price of sovereigns at 40 Riyals » £.gold 1. . , -~'i Another important feature of this year's pilgrimage, was the introduction of a system whereby pll overseas pilgrims were required to pay their tariff items and taxes in advance in their country of origin. This proved a great blessing to the pilgrims as they were spared the hardships arising from the seasonal appreciation of the Riyal in texms of sterling, (see paragraph 8 of Chaptar (1) ). tZii.-els -- vtl X. mu ' ^ i I c- l-UB . r.r: - There was Another notable change in the tariff. _ In the past, Sudanese pilgrims were charged half the mutawwif dues and in the case of Aest African pilgrims they were waived entirely.
