Xt has previously been decided that eight wornwen should oe employed for levelling the roads for a period of two months which are due to exp if e during these days. As the roads have not yet been levelled as desired, I think that the period should be extended furthermore so that the necessary : roads may be levelled. The taladeyah have been taking up the task of daily I sweeping and cleaning the ’Donkey Stand* where the Hinaini water is brought, without collecting any tax. As the Baladeyah own several plots of land near the market, it would undoubtedly be benefitted if a particular place is fixed for sellers of Hinaini water and a tax collected in return for that. rhis method will also be good to the public interests as such a place will be kept clean and cared for. 3) . As the ialadeyah prevent the people of the market from using weights which have not been approved of, several unchangeable weights have been ordered, but on investigation being made, I find that iron and other short weights are still being used in the market. If the haladeyah re-issue the ’Alan and impress on all the traders not to use the weights which have not been approved of by the Baladeyah, very satisfactory results would have been achieved. How the Baladeyah have nearly 150 sets of brass weights. 4) . At present the Baladeyah spend a large amount on motor-car J hire for the use of the Inspecting Committee and the Secretary etc., The expenses would be less if the Baladeyah had bought a second hand car dor these purposes.

The Majlis aeciaed that the Secretary should inspect those places, exempt the pour owners of nouses from Balaaeyah tax and levy a tax on each house the owner of which is in a position to pay the same at present. G). The Secretary submitted that the question of burning lime withfthe town limits may be reconsidered. The Majlis decided that their previous decision should &gt; be adhered to, i.e., it is not possible that a place outside should be fixed by the Balaaeyah for burning lime, but the Baladeyah have to disallow everyone who uses a particular place for constant burning of lime. The owners of nouses may, ^ however, be allowed to burn (lime) in case of necessity. 7) .

The Majlis, therefore, did not approve of this. (c) Letter from Mullah Abduliaii bin Abau Radha Iraqi dated^3rd Safar 1354, requesting the Balaaeyah to let him know the result of the report of the dissolved Majlis about his house.

On the narrow lane which Haji Salman Kamal wants to buy from the Baladeyah, vide his letter dateu 26th Muharram 1354 tp the Baladeyah. The Committee found it to be 44 feet long and 6 feet broad. It was decided that it may be sold to him for as.70/-. 2. On (fixing; a light near the house of Haji Muhammad al Larazi, vide letter dated 27th Muharram 1354 sent to the Baladeyah by the people of that quarter in which they requested that a light may be fixed in their quarter. The Committe decided tnat a light should be fixed on the corner of tne house of Hsji Muhammad Al Darazi. 3. On the plot of land situated at Fariq Bu ^ais which Haji Muhammad Taqi wants to have it bounded, vide his letter dated 25th Muhamram,addressed to tde Baladeyah. The Committee decided that the common road should run tnrough his land from the southern to the northern side which will cut it into two pieces; one piece on each side equal to the piece to be cut off. Should he refuse to have his land cut into two pieces, the road may then be mane to extend and he will have a portion on the eastern side (i.e.,from the sea)equal to tAe portion cut off his land V * to which 17 feet from the sea may'be added as compensation for having sea land instead of dry land. 4. On the 'Khan' (inn)of Haji Ali bin Abdullah Abul, vide his I letter dated 5th Muharram, in which he requested that the tax on his 'Khan' No.5 may be reduced. Inspection was made on this Khan and on another khan under No.l and it was found that there was no ground for reducing anything from (the tax) which has been decided. The tax on Khan No.l is Rs.5/- while that on No.l is Rs.2/8. It was, therefore, decided that taxes should be recovered on it whether it is occupied or vacant. 5. On (fixing) a light on the corner of the house of HajiHaji Abdullah Mahmud be as suggested by Haji Khalil bin Ibrahim al Muayyad, to light the road which is the center of several lanes leaning to the Jama Mosque.

Agenda for the 5th Meeting which will be held on Thursday tne 12tn Rabi-el-Awwal 13 o 4 r (13th June 1935J. 1). Submission of tne accounts of income anu expenditure of Manamah Balaueyah for tne month of Muharram 1354 after they have duly been passed by the Accounts Committee. They are as follows:- Income Rs.3527/8/3. nast year ! s income was ns.3593/7/6. Expenditure Rs.3306/2/4. Last year ! s expenditure was Rs.2092/^ ! 2). Since the Majlis, during the previous meeting, postponed the discussion over paragraph 2 of the Political Agent T s letter, so the matter may be put up for discussion again. 3). There are four wolves in the Baladeyah garden which are confined in a narrow cage. This cage is too narrow for them, especially in summer when much nasty smell comes out of it. I am, therefore, of opinion that tne Beladeyah should make this cage bigger than it is now. 4). His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad desired, through his Adviser, that the road leaning to tae southern sine of Qudhaibeyah ann Jufair, may extend from the western sine of the Palace Garden passing north of Sulmababd instead of being between the Palace ann Garden as it is now. 5). As it has been decided that the water stream should be filled up out of budget funds for this year, I think that the work may be put in hand and boundaries may be man^ for it by a contractor. 6).

No. 278/8 Bahrain, June 12, 1935, Dear Metcalfe, / With reference to para 3 of your letter addressed to the Secretary, Manamah munici pality, forwarded to me in your D.O No. 200/F2 dated 11th June 1935. 2. The question involved is one of great importance. You say that you 'remind' the Baladiya that no T Alaan t concerning foreigners can be published without the previous sanction of the Political Agent. 3. Municipal authority in Manamah and Muharaq is founded on the rules and regulations which are issued by the councils, after discussion, in the forms of municipal proclamations., that is, T Alaana T addressed to the public which do j not discriminate between Bahrain subjects and foreign subjects. It has been assumed for the last fourteen years that the Manamah muni cipality has authority to issue such f Alaans f which have applied to foreign as well as Bahrain subjects. 4. Copies of all f Alaans T issued by the municipal councils are, I believe, sent to the Agency for information and on frequent occasions foreigners have been tried in the Agency courts for failure to comply with municipal regulations which -which consist of municipal r Alaans f . 5. It is assumed that para 3 of your letter to the Manamah municipality applies equally to Muharraq municipality. I have advised the two councils to hold a special joint meeting at which they can consider their position and I should lil© to know, before attending this meeting, when the councils were informed of this ruling and whether I am correct in assuming that it is retrospective. There is an ordinary meeting of the Manamah municipal council tomorrow when your letter will be discussed Yours sincerely, Lieut. R. D. Metcalfe, I.A., Asst. Political Agent, Bahrain.TRANSLATION.

On Saturday tne SLna Sai’ar 1S54, the Manamah Baiaaeyah Budget Cominittee cornposeu of tne undermentioned persons, held tneir meeting:- l.Haji Khalil bin Ibrahim al iiuayyaa (BJHaji (4)Shaikh Isaq oin Abdur Raiiman si Khan (5; Haji Hasan bin Abdul Aziz al Ajaji (J; Haji Muhsin bin Anmaa ai Tajir (7R Husain Ali Kadhim Busheri and (8) Haji Muhammaa bin Husain al Larazi. Haji Abdul nziz al ^usaibi ana Brothers, witn a list of the Baladeyah r s current account. Before discussing this, his presence was required as he might nave some arguments in support oi what he alleged in his letter. The matter was therefore postponed for another cate on which he should appear | before the Committee. B. Two letters dated 11tn Safar lo54 sent to the Balaneyan by Haji Ahmad bin Muhsin bin Salloom. The first one is about his non-acceptauce of tne payment of its. 183/4/6 due from him on account of arrears of taxes on the properties of Shaiku Ahmad bin Ali bin Ahmad Al Khalifah for the ycax' i35i when those properties were under his control, on the ground that the an ears oi taxes were due from tne owner - he oeing a contractor. Thereupon oilice produced tne correspondences which tooAplace between tne Baladeyan and tne owner of the property and also the correspondences between the Eal&amp;deyah ssn ; ana Haji Ahmad bin Muhsin bin Salloom. As it became clear to the Committee tnat t^ces oi the early months were paid by Ahmad, so they decided that these arrears should likewise be paid by him. But as he is not the property-owner and the taxes now claimed by the on ice were not received by him as he so says, it has been decided that he should pay only its.oi/l/o, third of the amount claimed and the remaining two thirds are to be waived off. ihe second letter is about the sum of its.lJu/- wnicn he does Ali bin Muhammad Kanoo (3j Haji TIT- I'll unammad oin Hamad al Qadhi not admit that itisproaucea Ills seal mark acknowledging the receipt of tue amount whereupon he admitted that a sum of Rs.lQl)/- was due from him to the Balaaeyah, being the account of the year 1352 but that he paid it to Alwan bin Abdul Aal by the order of the Ex-Secretary Ali bin Husain Khalfan. The Head Clerk Abdur Rahman was asked about this amount and he said that upto now the amount stands in the name of Haji Ahmad bin Salloom. He does not knew if there is any private between them. The sum of Its.lQG/- is therefore proved against Haji Ahmad bin Salloom in view of nis admission. He was ordered to pay it to tiie Balaoeyah. If he had paid ks.100/- to Alwan on behalf of Ali bin Husain Khalfan, that is a private thing.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAI Bahrain, June 21, 1935 Dear Cole, Before Shaikh Abdullah bin T lsa, in his capacity as acting President of Manamah Muni cipal Council and permanent President in Muhara^, discusses with you the question of municipal taxation, I should like to point out some facts about the present system. 2. The Bahrain government and the Agency have persistently urged on the municipalities the necessity for their being as much as pos sible self-supporting institutions. The coun cils themselves would prefer to avoid the trouble of collecting municipal taxes by persuading the government to impose additional customs taxes in order to provide money for them. The govern ment does not approve of these suggestions which are obviously unsuitable. It would be unfair to impose any general tax which was to benefit only the two municipalities. The government does however pay a subsidy of Rs 1,000/- per month to each of the municipalities, it used to pay exactly double the present amount. 3. I suppose there is no civilized country in the world where taxation is lower than in Bahrain. There is no income tax, land tax, date tax, ashur or zikat. The only taxation is the customs duty and the house and shop tax levied by the municipalities inside their areas. ThisThis tax provides their main revenue and enables them to carry on their work which I think they do well. 4. The position in Manamah is, 1 imagine, almost unique owing to the number of foreigners resident in the capital and the value of the property which is owned by them. The total number of houses registered in the municipal ledger is 3,136, of these 1,189 are owned by foreigners and out of the remainder 56 are Bahrain government property, paying ground rents. This figure includes houses of every kind and a large proportion are straw huts. It does not include shops, stores and offices. 5. -^s far as can be ascertained the total number of large stone houses which are let is 310, out of these 120 belong to Bahrain subjects and 190 belong to foreigners. In almost every case the tenants are foreigners. The rent of these houses varies from Rs 10/- to Rs 30/- per month and it includes such houses as the one occupied by the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the old Bank. 6. Until 1351 all house taxes were paid by the tenants. In 1351, mainly owing to my arguments, a resolution was passed by the Manamah municipal council to the effect that the house tax should be paid by landlords. Ten months later the majlis decided to revert to the old system. I reported the matter to the Agency at the time. I n the case ofof bazaar property, shops, offices and go dov/ns the tax always has oeen paid by the tenants and it has never been suggested that the system should be altered, I think it would be a mistake to change the system in the bazaars as the landlords are in many cases members of the Ruling Family and the result would be that they would pay nothing. 7. In the case of houses the method of payment is according to assessment which was made many years ago^ and has been reduced several times by an all round reduction per cent. When new houses are built or added on to, the committee assesses the tax or adds to it. 8. ohops and offices in the bazaar pay two annas per rupee according to the rent. it was recently suggested that a similar system should apply to houses which are leased in the residential part of the town, that is outside the bazaar area, provided that the lease amounts to not less than Rs 300/- per annum. In case of houses whose rent does not amount to Rs 300/- per annum the old system of assessment will apply* It is considered reasonable that houses occupied by their owners should pay less than houses which are let. 1 think that this is a not unreasonable suggestion and I think that to assess the tax according to the rent is a fair way of deciding it. Yours sincerely, - * ' Gaptaia G.A.Cole, I.A.,TRANSLATION. /4*c Agenaa for the 6th meeting of the Manamah Balaaeyan Majlis which will be held on Thursday the 26th Rabi-el-Awwal 1354 (27th June 1935). | 1) . The Balaueyah beg to draw the attention of tne members to Article 34 of the Balaoeyah rules, that is, they should not talk outside of what takes place in the meetings ana I also not to tell of the special arguments. 2) . The Majlis helc on 12tn Rabi-el-Awwal(1354) asked me to watch and count the daily income of Hinani market and the number of donkeys which come there and also to watcn the sanitary condition of that place. I nave tne nonour to submit the 1allowing remarks to the mem/bers:- (a) After careful examination I found the number of donkeys* which come to the Hinaini market to be varyingfrom 6u to 75 donkby daily. The daily income therefore comes to Rs.4/- or so.. (b) There is no sanitary system there as there is a constant ban smell in tnat place. The people of tne market are also using it for -airts. There is a great danger in that apart from tne fact that tne place is situated in the midst of tne market. 3) . T^e Baladeyah nas actually opened tne road suggested by the Majlis in its previous meeting and is doing every eiiort to complete it before H.n.Shaikh Sir Hamaa snifts to I his summer resort by the will of God. 4) . Recently tne Baiadeyan nan been making snaaes for tne smm market as decided in tne 3rd meeting held on 13th Safar 1354. [ ■ A large portion oi it has been completed. The view of tne market is suitable now ana convenient to the people of tne market. 5j. nuring one ol the previous meetings of tne Bai&amp;ueyah, tne question ol leprosy and leprous people in the town was put up for discussion . 1 find now tnat there is a large number oi people sufiering irom this disease and they mixmix with the souna people without any precaution, there is no doubt that this awful disease is contagious. It would have been a great favour on the people and the country had the Baladeyah thought oi this matter and made arrangements for keeping the people who got this disease in a special place for them. I am submitting this question for your consideration. g). n Q reaCl i ng the reports of the Inspecting Committee who carried out inspections on certain places.V 9 ' TEANSUnOM- Minutes of the 5tn Sitting hela on Thursaay the 12th Rabi-el- iivVvval 1354 (13th June 1335;.

Note of a conversation between Shaikh Abdullah bin r Isa A1 Khalifah, President of the Muharraq %nicipality and Acting President of the Manamah Municipality, Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Muhammad Salih Shatr, Secretary of the Manamah Municipality, and the Political Agent. \ These conversations arose from correspondence with L S' \ r w. the Agency terminating with the Adviser f s demi-official letter to the Political Agent dated the 21st ^une 1935. Before dealing with the facts of the conversation it would be as well to set forti the constitution of both these Municipalities and their methods of taxation with regard to house property. ^ The Manamah Municipality was instituted 12 or 13 years ago by Major (now Colonel) Dickson and the %harraq Municipality some years later by Mr. Belgrave on exactly the same lines as the Manamah Municipality. The method of house taxation in both Municipalities was that the tenant should pay house tax and not the landlords. Taxes payable were assessed at -/ 2 /~ in the rupee on the rent. This system has been maintained to the the present day in/Muharraq Municipality. ^ In Manamah during the time that Captain (now Major) Prior was Political Agent, he and Mr. Belgrave introduced the more normal system of making the house-owners pay the house tax in the case of the residential area only. So far as the bazaar was concernedcthe old system, whereby the tenants pay house tax w^as retained. The system of requiring the house-owners to pay the tax failed for the following reasons and was abandoned after 11 months trial. /(D2 (1) . Tenants could not be induced to pay either their rent or house tax to the house-ovvners, who in turn found it difficult to pay the house tax. (2) . The ^Municipality w r ere alw r ays in a position to make the occupier of a house, whether he was a tenant or an owner, pay the tax. (3) . Many owners, particularly foreigners, are absent from Bahrain for long periods. ( 4 ) . Much of the ^inicipal property is owned by the Ruling Family and rented to shop-keepers and others on the customary understanding that taxes will always be paid by tenants. U When, after 11 months, the old system of taking house tax from tenants w r as reverted to the Political Agent was informed and no action having been taken by him, the %nicipal- ity assumed that silence meant consent. Yftien I was appointed Officiating Political Agent on reference to previous papers I discovered that there was no decision whether or not foreign house owners or their tenants should pay house tax and took the matter up with the Municipality after P had been approached by certain foreign house owners, vdio complained that the assessment was excessive and that if they were made to pay house tax they ■would have to increase their rents. limited to that of foreign house owners in Bahrain. The system whereby house tax was recovered from house owners has proved a failure for the reasons set forth above and in both Municipalities house taxes are recovered from tenants in the case of all Bahrain subjects. It would obviously create an impossible situation were I to insist that in the case of foreign house owners house tax v/as to be recovered from them and not from the tenants. Since the weight of experience has shown that the only satisfactory method of collecting house tax in Bahrain is from the tenants I agreed to allow that system to continue in so far as foreign house owners were concerned. The interest of the Political Agent, of course, is 18-7-1935L#0#]' ! o: /I ^ Political Agency, Bahrain, the 16ta ^aiy 13.35 ith reference to your cemi-of^icial letter dated the Slat June 1355, I send you herewith a copy of a note of our conversation this morning• I agree tnat house tax should be collected from tenants of foreign house owners. V.ould you kindly inform the Presidents of both Municipalities accordingly.

No. 415/8 Bahrain, July 23, 1935. v { S N* Dear Cole, With reference to our recent conversa tion regarding municipal house tax. The question of the payment of municipal house tax by the Asiatic members of the Agency staff who have taken houses on lease in Manamah has now arisen. I was informed that some of the members of the Agency staff told the Secretary of the Manamah municipality that they were not liable to pay the house tax and he referred the matter to me some months ago but until a decision was reached on the principle of the taxation I took no action. It is a question which should be defi nitely settled and not one which should be argued between the municipal council and the people concerned. It is now established * i • f that as in the past tenants are to pay the I tax, not landlords. The Political Agency enjoys special privileges which includes freedom from taxation and I think that this privilege should apply to all its official buildings such as the Court of the Indian Assistant on Government Road. I gather that- 2 - I that the clerks and employees of the Agency iyv ^ argue that because they are employed by the j I Agency they should be exempt from municripal taxes. I do not think that this is reasonable. V 4 » % t D A : Such a priv ileg e would create a precedent which would be followed by the Asiatic staff of the Royal Navy and the Royal Flying Corps, some of the former have already rented houses in Man amah. A large number of the employees of the Bahrain government live in houses which they rent in Man am ah and they pay the muni cipal house tax in the usual way. I am not acquainted with the rules govern- . ^ ing the house allowances of the Agsncy employees but I expect they were based on the assumption that municipal house tax is paid by landlords. Even if this is the case I do not think the Manamah municipality, which is not a wealthy institution, should be called upon to make this concession from what is almost its only source of revenue. During recent years the staff of the Agency has increased and 1 presume that it is more likely to increase still further than to decrease. Yours sincerely, Captain G. A. Cole, I.A., H.B.H's Political Agent, Bahrain. ? •i liAii SLk 'i I v; 1 i • Llinutes of the Manamah Balacieyah 7th meeting helu on hhurouay 1 the 10th Rabi-el-Thani 1004 (11.7.35).

The inspecting Committee should also find out a suitable place at ^Udhaibeyah to be used as a $ stand for the cars. f 3j.

As the Baladeyah appear to nave delivered the siiop in a complete condition to its owner during the year 1351 and as there is notning on record to show that there was sometning left by the Balaoeyan as revealed to the Secretary and the clerk from tne old records, the agent was asked:Wnat made tne owner to spend tne amount v/hich he claims, on his property; was that by Baladeyah f s order?

The Baladeyah experience a great difficulty owing to the refuses which are thrown near the artesian wells, on the streets and on the seashores, in fact, such a scene is disgraceful to the town and it is,therefore,desirable for the police to take strict steps to put a stop to this practice as they usee to do previously.

The Baladeyah have, on several occasions, noticed that manure was taken out of houses and thrown on trie roads and then carried to the gardens. The manure is accumulated on the roads in such a way that it almost blocks the roads %nd noone i can pass.

Latrines and cesspools of the town. The Baladeyah are undergoing great hardships in connection with latrines and cesspools dug on Baladeyah roads,as their owners do not care for them.

I suggest, for the approval of the Majlis , that the Baladeyah should place on several parts of the market arid the town,kerosene tins to be filled with sand and painted with red paint and provided v.itn handles, so that they may be used for extinguishing fires (God forbid)..3 /yr 6) .

I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 62/F/2 dated 16th February 1936 on the subject of payment of municipal tax by employees of the Poli tical Agency, Bahrain, and to state that a trans lation of your letter has been forwarded to the Manamah municipality who are considering the remarks and suggestions contained in paragraphs 1 to 5. 2. nfith reference to paragraph 6 and the tax against Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy al-Hashimy. The tax for the ten months, when it was recoverable from the landlords, amounts to *5 23/7, and the municipality is agreeable to this amount being deducted from the total, viz., Rs 266/15/6. The balance would then be Rs 243/8/6. 3. With reference to paragraph 7. On going through the list of arrears forwarded to you, I notice To His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent . Bahrain. Sir, that .- 2 - t p.-&gt;1 that Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy al-Hashimy is the only tenant from whom house tax prior to the municipal resolution of 22nd Safar 1351 is recoverable. Khan Bahadur apparently did not pay this because he thought he was exempt from house tax. I had referred to this question ftxp Pvt* in my D.O. No- 1024/8 dated 6 th March 1935. u fLy , J 4. With reference to paragraph 8 . Tile notice of the municipality, (No- 16/54 of Rabialthany 1354) relates to an alteration in the rate of house tax. The resolution making house tax recoverable from tenants was passed on 12th Safar 1352. The Agency did not agree to this resolution being applied to foreigners at first but at a meeting arranged later between the Political Agent and the President of the Manamah municipality on 18th July 1935, at which I was present, the Political Agent agreed to house tax being collected from tenants. Notes of this neeting were forwarded to me with Captain A.Cole's D.O. No. 228-P/2 dated 18th July 1935. 5 . If tax is going to be paid only from 29th Rabialthany 1354, it becomes a question of only four months as the list forwarded with my |C?memorandum No- 861/8 dated 19th November 1935, contains only arrears until the end of Shaban 1354. It is presumed that the Baladiya tax for the following months is to be recovered direct from the employees. A confirmation is requested. 6 .

I think that it is reasonable tnat our Agency clerks shoulo pny municipal tax when occupying &amp; privately ownee house, but i should like to aou the following:- into two sections: The first is distinctly in favour of a landlord, who occupies his owh house,i.e., he pays a 'liat rate” municipal tax of Rs.3u/~ a year ana not a percentage tax on the rental value of his house, wiiereas a tenant wno occupies the same house on ,a lease or otnerwise pays tax at 12| jo of the rental value. This applies to houses the rental value of wnich is Rs.30Q/-/- per annum ana above.(para 2, minute of Balaaiyah meeting nela on lu/5/35 - page 13, file F/2). 2. Houses unaer this yearly rental value are assessed individually by the Municipal Committee in accordance with House taxes laid down on page 28 of the Balaaayan Vv Tr Q _ T Q o June 1925. oara 8 considers it reasonable that landlords should pay less tax than tenants. This system is not considered reasonable either in ^nglana 01 m India and to me it seems unfair that a clerk should pay more in taxes on his house than his landlord, who is usually a comparatively wealthy man. 1. The present system of house tax may be divided ux ■ .—-* 1 Im '* '- ■BMgM A.P.A. Balaaeyah Alan Nu.7 of 1352 on which letter No.l43/Y.O. dated the 28tn March 1935 was based is submitted (at page 70 of File No.F/4). At that time we used to receive no copies of the minutes of Balsdeyah meetings but we usee to recexve copies of a lass.

C • 20/11 A.P *A. ihe file was svbriitted to f.a. few days ago in connection with the sane question and is still pending up with him. / On the 86th November 1935 i discussed this matter with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, i'here are two separate questions at stake: one is whether Agency employees should pay house tax on the houses they occupy, ^he answer to this is that if we admit that the house tax is to be paid by tenants of houses then employees of the Agency should pay just as anybody else pays. There is no question of extra-territorial rights coming into such a matter, 4 2* question nether or not tenants are to pay. I understand that originally house taxes were paid by the tenants of houses; that some 5 years ego ^ejor t r i 0 r and Mr. Belgreve managed to get through the Baladiyah a proposal to make the landlord responsible he frfeiiftg met with considerable opposition but was pushed through. In 1933 the last Baladiyah passed a resolution changing the system^to tenants paying and this has been comfirmed by the present B^laoiyah. 1 he question is did the Agency ever accept the change made in 1933? There are certain arguments in favour of(2&gt; tenants paying/ the B Lyah tax (though they are not necessarily arguments, which would be approved in more civilized circumstances). It is said to be easier for the Baladiyah to collect the tax from tenants largely, I gather, because landlords are people of v.hom the Baladiyah stand in awe, particularly a number of the bj^ai^h’s relatives. 4' It may be necessary to find out what is done in India, that is to say, whether Municipal house tax is paid by the tenant or by the landlord. £, In the first place we must be certain whether or not we accepted the change in 1932. o- U-c C l u. I 1 4 otO 4A~*.F/P.V.O.II. pp 57-59. It is dangerous to allov, the Mc^icipality to assume that silence means consent^ though perhaps not unreasonable.^ee paragraph 4 of Officiating Political Agent 1 s note of 18th J uly 1335). I think that, apart from this case, we should make a rule that nothing touching the financial position of foreigners should be put into force without the Political Agent*s specific sanction in writing. We should consider this separately. 2. We must also consider drawing up precise instructions show r ing what control we wish to exercise on the Municipality. 3. It has been ruled (vide Officiating Political Agent*s note and demi-official letter to Adviser to 18th July 1935) and in the circumstances, I think, rightly that house tax should be paid by tenants. I do not think that it is a sound practice, but in the peculiar conditions of Manalaah and ^uharraq, it is probably more practical than trying to enforce payment from landlord.* 4. This being the case it remains to consider the question of Agency employees paying the house tax. Obviously they must do so in the same way as any other person who rents and house. 5. Please put up scale of tax charged—/.*. 3-12-1935. P.T.OA.P.A. Re 5 on pre - pa^e « The following two different scales of tax are cnargea by the Municipality (1) A T flat rate f municipal tax which varies from Rs.4/- to Rs.3u/- per annum is pain,in accordance witn nouse taxes laid down on page 28 of the Baladiyah oye-law^by (aj Landlord who occupies nis own house, ana (b) Ten|iant who occupies a iiouse tne yearly rental vlaue of which is less than Rs.30u/- ( para 2 minute of Baladiyah Meeting held on 18.5.35 - page 13, file F/2 and T Ilan No:18/45 dated 31.7.35 -page 132, file F/4). Two annas in the rupee or 12-^ /© of tne rental vlaue. This applies to houses the rental value of which is Rs.300/- per annum and above( para 2 minute of Baladiyah Meeting nele on 18.3.35- page 13, file F/2 and T Iland No.18/45 dated 31.7.35 - page 132, file F/4 j. ( 2 ) 4.12.35 I should now like to get clear (a) at-what rate each Agency, employee should pay house tax, and vhat amount is due from him since the rule that tenants should psypay was brought in again. Clearly we cannot take into account amounts which may have been due prior to the change in system from land lords paying to tenants paying, it is long ago and tne Baladiyah should have recovered these when due, equally clearly employees cannot be called upon to pay for the period during which the rule v. : as that landlords should, pay. Another thing I wish to know is ttrh^t-rf any rf r*. Thi:: r.houlc 1 be treated early. rent when it became the rule for the landlords to pay* If so was the rent again reduced to its original J igur-. when the tenants paying system came in again.. s soon as this individual matter has been cleared iru, up we must take up the question of what is^done to signify the approval of the Political Agent to resolutions of the . Baladiyah which affect foreigners. £ rima facie I am inclined to inform them that the Political Agent is satisfied that they ca'n carry on under their ^residents without the presence of the P.A but that he requires a copy of the agenda to be sent to him before any meeting and that a. copy of the proceedings shoulc be sent to him immediately after the meeting and that no order effecting foreigners should be regarded as accepted until the i J .n has accepted the proceedings in writing. x t should also be made clear that because the P.A accepts proceedings, it does not necessarily mean that he ap:roves of all that is done, i.e., some system such as ten.' tits paying house tax may be brought into force and while obviously the P.A not approve of such a system, he may yet accept it in the peculiar conditions of Bahrain. This question vi 1, however, have to be gone into - ter the pie s ^i of the'individual house tax has been settled. ■ 3-1S-1935. i attach a statement piving the information required m2, In para.l of my note of 9.12.35 I pointed out that employees clearly dould not be coaled upon to pay for the period during which therule was that landlords shd pay. How does this affect statement? 3. The I.A. ,for example, is being asked to pay for 52 months. The tenants’ paying rule has only been re-introduaed since 26.4.33 i.e. 32 months ago. So I.A. is apparently being asked to pay for 20 months too much . 4. Will A?P.A. please look into this. y . . 5. On what ground was the tax raised to 12J % and have we accepted the rise on behalf of foreigners ? 15.12.3S r IA.P.A&gt; n ( h &lt;k^^\ I V ^ P.A* wishes to know (vide his notes dated 9-12-35 and 15-12-35):- ( (a) At what rate should Agency employees pay tax; ^(b) What amount is due from them from the 26th April 1934) (c) Did landlord raise rent of houses when landlords had to pay the tax; &lt;d) Have Landlords reduced rent of houses when employees had to pay the municipal tax; (e) On what ground was the tax raised; and (f) Has the Political Agent accepted the rise on behalf of foreigners* As regards (a) Landlords living in their own houses pay y taxes as set forth at page 28 oi the Baladeyah Bye Laws, that is, they continue to pay at the old and lesser rate. Whereas since 1st August 1935 the increased rate of 12t$ of rental value referred to in (e) and (f) below were brought into force, and made applicable to tenants only* therefore, tenants are being asked to pay a greater tax than their landlords, that is, were a landlord to live in his tenant’s house he would not be payir* at 12-$ of rental value but the rate as * p resell bed at page 28 of the Baladeyah Bye Laws. The tenants claim that this is unfair and that the same rate should apply to them* Amounts due are shown in the last column of the revised statement (flagged*. ’B*)* As regards (c) . No, but in addition to the normal rent tenants refunded to landlords the amount of the tax paid by the landlords to the Baladeyah * 9 ftovwrlWrw ^ (kw As regards Cb ) &gt; -P A , t ku** fr* ^°.H J f &gt;VVW. it*. liSee pT v 29 V.6. file F/4 See p ibid 70 As regards (d)&lt; flu? lu*djUl,lu- S l iK As regards (e) « As regards ( f) fVo-U-Y &lt; £vu ~ -yKX^ck, ‘ rw khr Baladeyah. No, but in addition to the rent tenants will have to pay the tax direct to the Baladeyah if P.A. agrees that the tax should be paid by foreigners.(See also reply to (c) above). The tax was raised at the suggestion of the Secretary to the Baladeyah (vide p. 2 of file F/2) and was passed by the Majlis (see p.13 of file F/2): also please see paragraph (f) below. The question of the increased rate @ 12i% was not referred to the P.A.* for his approval, but only a copy of the Agenda and Minutes (see pp.2 and 13 c)f file F/2) and T Alan (see p.70 of file F/4)were forwarded to the Agency as usual, and therefore was not accepted nor rejected on behalf of foreigners (s«e axso under paragraph (e) above). I he (question of the Agency Staff was to be settled by the P.A. (Colonel Loch) of on return from Busliire (see p«b® ox file F/2 and Captain Cole’s note dated the 2Sth July 193b at page 8 of N0T3S to that file). Captain Cole as Officiating P.A. accepted the principle only of tenants paying the house tax (see pages 57 to 59 of file F/2) hut did not accept the me of 12$ for foreigners. ^ r - • ■ &lt;.*K -ha u-c*. k ri ' |'l|-yv^ / 5Z2J I showed the draft to the Adviser who thought that it was suitable. It should issue. g. i said that I thought that it was necessary to make some arrangement vrhereby the Baladiyahs would, not impose taxation on imposts on foreigners without the acceptance f the Agency. I suggested that the best plan would be for us'to reply to their letters sending copies of the minutes of proceedings by saying that we accept them. Though I pointed out that by accepting them it should not be understood as necessarily accepting that the arrangements were sound. 5. I mentioned that the Resident had for some time been anxious that we should definitely disassociate ourselves from the Baladiyahs who should run their own administration. I said that I did not w r ant to send this officially to the Baladiyahs as otherwise they might take it that a reign of chaos was now starting but that I would get Shaikh ^uhammad and Shaikh Abdullah and tell them verbally. 4. Resubmit after issue of the letter. In order that memoers of the office establishrnent shall not suffer hardship from paying arrears I will authorize (once a settlement is reached) the payment of the tax due up taa to and including that payaole on the rent for February 1936 from the Llnoiiicial iund. i3nt tney must then put aside the amount oi the tax for any sub sequent period,even if it is not actually paid to the the Baladiyah till/final settlement n&amp;d been reached. . issued letter no . 62 - v /2 dated the 16th mebruarv 1S36 to Adviser. 11.P.1936.(2ZZ) ( - CiJ? y^d a: I should li^e to he clear on the fallowing point before I taKe up the question of future procedure with SsaiKhs Muhammad and ’Abdullah and the Adviser. 2. We claim that the Baladiyahs cannot pass ,or rather put into effect, any resolution wnich involves payments by foreigners. On what do we base this attitude ? From one point of view thw question has only recently arisen as in the past the P.A. (and in the beginning the ShaiKh) was on the Baladiyahs,so that anything which ms passed had his consent - in future,when the P.A. nojf longer even in theory sits on the Baladiyah,this will not be the ease. Possibly our attitude may be claimed to rest ultimately on the fact that any payment by foreigners could only be enforced through the Agency Court, which would not enforce any payment not recognized by the Agency. Please examine this question with a view' to seeing, in particular, whether there is anything laid down on it he subject of the powers of the Baladiyah to impose regulations involving payments on foreigners. would p.A • please see Article I»il 7 of the Municipal Bye-cav/s. tioveriment in so far as foreigners are concerned in any case under the above Article any Bye-naw of the municipality can only have the effect of law when approved212 of by the Bahrain Government.
