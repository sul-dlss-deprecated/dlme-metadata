(b) That for the sake of greater clearness as to the procedure contemplated paragraph 13 should be altered, beginning at the third xine on page 20 of the draft despatch to read as follows: '......His Majesty's Goverm.ient will have no alternative but to require the matter to be referred to arbitration. If this threat fails to induce the Iraqi Government to honour the undertakings given to the two Sheikhs, /ou should inform them that the matter must now be settled by arbitration, and should endeavour to induce V to consent to a special reference to arbitration by agreement.

I have no douht that Dickson is on the right track in smelling out the motive of the Iraq authorities for being so obstructive over the Shaikh 's date gardens, and if you have communicated the result of his enquiries stripped of his peculiar mannerisms to the India Office, I think that we have done all that is possible at this end. But I wish I could feel as sanguine as you appear to do of the result. It interests me very much to hear what Laithwaite has to say about the Has-al-Khaima affair. The action taken by the Navy against the Ras-al-Khaima dhows is, I think, justifiable on the ground that we are the guardians of maritime peace and are entitled to use any weapons that we like for that purpose. If we choose to use air weapons we must get all Shaikhs to cooperate in the means necessary for the maintenance of that arm. They have benefited by our vigilance for nearly-a century past and if they are not willing to help in new developments must be brought into-2- line. But I admit that the argument is thin, and I am not surprised that the Foreign Office was upset. However, all is well that ends well, and I trust that we shall hear no more of it.

This, the sheikh said, was contrary to the written undertaking given to him by Sir P. Cox during the war, in virtue of which his date groves were exempted from all taxes as a reward tor the services which the sheikh had rendered. 2. I have noticed in the news diaries from Bagdad that this question has in the past occupied the attention of the Iraq Cabinet, and that certain proposals in connexion therewith had been discussed, but I am unaware that any definite decision has been taken. In any case, the sheikh evidently expects the terms of the document given to him to be implemented, whatever the future status of Iraq may be, and looks to His Majesty s Government to see that the promises made to him by the then High Commissioner will continue to be carried out. , 'I* Ibeg that I may be informed in due course what reply I am to give to the sheikh. I should be glad to allay his fears, as tne rent of his properties at Basra, alter deducting the expenses for the maintenance of his numerous family and dependents in Iraq, is all that he has to live on at present, and he is naturallv anxious to avoid any reduction in these revenues at this stage. 4.

As a result they have decided to anthori rie Iraq.

Government propose to negotiate with him privately for a direct settlement of the question of immunity from taxation promised him in respect of his date gardens at ^asrar . settlement contemplated hy them would he for purchase of date gardens together with all rights and exemption thereto attached. Sheikh should also 'be iniormed that although he vjould of course 'be entirely free tu accept oi' reject any offer made to him Iraci, Eis majesty's Government consider that he v ^ould he well advised to accept a reasonable offer, since sale of lis pioperties to Iraq, would not only provide him with a substantial capital sum but would he also removing a source of friction betv/een Iraq, and Kuwait which, ' if not eliminated now, might seriously prejudice relations between the two States and could hardly fail to lead to nnicrtunate consequences. Shaikh should he reminded that Iraq.Iraq. Government will protelDly 'be free from British control after 1932. If Stieikh enquires v^hat is attitude of His majesty's Government in regard to undertaking given on their behalf in IS 14 to his predecessor he should 'be informed that that undertaking is regarded 'Dy His Majesty's Government as a valid and 'binding obligation 'but that in 'their view this obligation has now devolved upon Iraq. Government. The Iraq. Government r .owever do not accept this view, 'but rather thali come into open conflict on the point with His lajesty's GovernmBnt, are prepared, without prejudice to question of principle involved, to attempt to reach a settlement of the issue on the 'basis / ol a reasonable composition and in all the circumstances His lajesty's Government consider this method will offer most hopeful prospect of settling matter in 'best interest bf all concerned. If Sheikh should then ask what will happeir if he is unable to settle with Iraq, as regards purchase price of his properties and direct negotiations therefore break down, he should be informed that matter would then fall to be dealt with between His Majesty's Government and Iraq. Governemnt. His Majesty's Government would do their utmost to obtain formal efxceptarce of this obligation by Iraq^. If their efforts were successful and Iraq^were forced to accept obligation as devolving upon themselves it seems almost certain that the^ would wish to compound their liability to Sheikh in much the same manner as is now proposed. It seems doubtful in such event whether Sheikh would on balance obtain terms anypnore generous than those which are likely to be offered-to him now since the atmosphere in which the negotiations would then be CDnducted could scarcely fail to be less favourable than it is now, when Iraq.

Political Agent should reply that Sheikh is himself hest ahle to Judge whether the terms offered 'by Iraq, are or are not accept- -ahle, and that he is unahle to advise on this poirt. Political xigent should, while not informing Sheikh that he is doing so, acquaint Kis majesty's Government with terns of Iraq, offer as disclosed to him By Sheikh, If that offer then appears to Eis -ajesty*s Soverrm-ent as wholly unreasonable it would he for consideration wuetber Hi^h OomiLissioner for Iraq, should not he instructed to intervene privately with Iraq.

CurtriuVi ;cUOHO&amp;- Political Agency, Kuwait• 3ist August 1930. My dear Colonel Eiscoe, I write this in a hurry to catch the down mail, so forgive wording^etc. I sent you yesterday a long telegram giving the result of my talk with the Shaikh. I Hope you thought the contents satisfactory. For the length of the telegram I apologise, hut I wanted you to get a clear picture 01 how tne Shaikh felt ahout things in general and what remarks ne maae, as I think H .M.G. will find them useful* I fear the problem is going to be more difficult to solve than either H.M.G. or the 1 IRA^ Lrovt.think, Ir fac'. the part that has struck me all along has been the lack of knowledge displayed at home and in Baghdad, as to tne enormous size of the Subah estates. As I tried to make clear in my telegram the properties involved are the FADAGHI X2.:-. Estate bought by Mubarak for £ T.80,000/- and now in the hands of ohaikh Ahmad^ Shaikh Akdullah al galim, Shaikh Kasir al-Subah and Snaikh Hamad al-Mubarak and the j AO ' Estate ( see sketch). Die latte according to the- Shaikh has a frontage along tne river - about 7 miles and includes practically the whole c: ao peninsula\ or promontory. This property 50 years ago er =e.; at Fao village, but since then has increased 5 miles to the South by gardens recovered from the ■ • Todaj^j^he Shaikh said, the Fao lands were four times the Size of the Fadaghi^eh gardens and he suggested their value was 3 to 4 times that of the latter. Wjiile-2- While 1 am rather proud of having got the Shaikh to agree to direct negotiations with IRAQ.,- so easily, I am hound to confess^ I think he did so largely because of the pressure 1 got to tear. He is of course pathetically anxious to please H.M.G. and I made the most of this. //t the same time I could see the Shaikh was greatly upset at the turn of events, and quite definitely intimated that he only agreed to H.M.G.'s wishes -because of the 3 assurances given him. He also clearly let it be known that he thought the difficulties too big to be surmounted in the way K.U.G. and IHAQ, expected. His reasons were as followss- (i) IRAii could never find the money the Subah family would stand ouo for» (ii) J/hereas the Fadaghiyeh. might possit.^ be disposed of, as only 4 persons had to ce squared that of Fao was in a totally different category# It was owned by about 120 ladies and male members of the oubah family, and he saw no hope of them all being induced to part, 1 t was not a question of owning property only, bu + possessors ( including many old ladles) their servants, hangers on, slaves, etc., etc.,got their dates, fruit, wheat, barley, bhoosa, lucerne, lirewood, date branches, mats , etc •, all oil ti.ei respective properties. iheir gardens were their all and each had no othe? means of livelihood. :.Ionev In Itett wouldwould never satisfy for they were forbidden to lay it out at interest s It was a case of posterity and their children^ 4 children with them all. In other words said the Shaikh^ the Fao property was the life»hlood of the rulers of Kuwait and their family as well as two- thirds of the people of Kuwait,and they could not 'be expected to commit suicide, (iii) There was the case of the oubah prestige. The Fao gardens had 'been in the family for close on 120 years and was bound up with the family history. He,the Shaikh^was not strong enough^ he said, to force a sale. There would be too big an outcry and he would probably oe deposed if he tried. Already he held the throne by personal popularity. He had several powerful interests in opposition to himseli, notacly the son of the late ruler, a strong character and the ^aid Mubarak, both capable of much mischief. Speaking generally the Shaikh has become suspicious of our policy and gave me to understand that he felt we were trying to appease Faisal at his expense -j because he was the weaker of the two» This did not -ound nice, and of course I did my best to disabuse : Personally I fear the line IRAQ, :;*^take when they are faced with the real difficulties at stake, will be to say' Lets call everything quits, you Shaikh Ahmad only agree to pay revenue, and we will leave you and your heirs and successors free to enjoy what is yours'. The fear then will be that t^^ave future trouble, the Shaikh will agree being literally blackmailed into doing sc. Ihis would be decidedly rough on Kuwait. , Youths incerely, sd/-E.R.P .Dicks on.33/15, 35/135, and 53/11 grlYfcf and .^ereonal.

M's Governiuont^ Foreign Office, 3*V»1» 15th iiugust, 193o. Sir, It will be vrithin your recollection that amonr the aaaurancos given infiovember 1914 to the Sheikh of wohaaiderah by the British iiesiuent in ths Persian Gulf on behalf of Hia iaajesty 's GoTemment was one by which the date gardens then in the Sheikh's ossaseion on the Turkish side of the Ihatt-el-Arab should remain in full possession of him and his heirs, and be i mune from taxation. 2. irotractsd discussions, covering a period of some yearo, have talcen place with the Iraqi Sovernm.-nt ooncorning this immunily from taxation promised by His Majesty *3 Government in 1914 to the Sheikh of iiohammerah, and the similar assurances given at the same time to the Sheikh oC Koweit. It his roveu impossible, despite the strongest pressure, to induce the Iraqi Government to recogaise these promises as obligations which devolve on them; and after full consultation nth the High Commissioner for Iraq (who is now in London), the Governraont of India, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, UL -ita^jsty's Govornment have decided to authorise tte Jiaoi Government to negotiate direct vith tlu oheiichb, while at the iiame time reserving their decision as to the action to be taken should direct negotiations break h 3 - A' Up-* / 3 {^ k %&lt;[ _ aown.« •VII* 3. In these circuraatanoes, I shall bfa glad If you will forthwith approach the Sheikh of ^ohamerah in the following sense. Xou should inform him that the Iraqi firovarnraent propose to negotiate with him privately for a direct settlement of the question of the inmmity from taxation promised him in respect of his date gardens in Iraq# The settlement which the Iraqi Government have in mind would take the fonn of the purchase of the date gardens together with all rights and exemptions thereto attaching. The Sheikh should also be informed that although he would of course be entirely free to accept or reject any offer made to him by the Iraqi Government, His Majesty's Government consider that he would be well advised to accept a reasonable offer, since the sale of his properties to Iraq would not only provide him with a substantial capital sum, but wcwld also obviate the difficulties which would seem bound to arise sooner or later once the Iraqi Government is completely independent of British control. The Sheikh should be reminded that the Iraqi Governmen t will probably be free from British control after 1^32. 4. It is probable that the Sheikh will then enquire what is the attitude of Bis ^ajesty f s Government in regard to the undertaking given to him on their behalf in 1914. In reply, he may be informed that that undertaking is regarded by His Majesty's Government as a valid and binding obligation, but that in their view this obligation has now devolved U ]on the Irani Government. The Iraqi Government, howevei?&gt;. i M 1 'ii ■ however, do not aooapt this view, but, rather than corae into open conflict on the point with His ilaj0aty r s Governraent, are prepared, without prejudice, to the ouestion of principle involved, to attempt to reach a settlement of the issue on the basis of a reasonable composition; and in all the circumstances His kajesty's (roverninent consider that this method will offer the most hopeful prospect of settling the matter in the best interests of all concerned. 5. If the Sheikh should than abk what woali happen if he is unable to settle with Iraq as regards the purchase price of his properties, and his direct negotiations with the Iraqi (iovemment should therefore break down, he should be informed that the matter would then fall to be dealt with between liia majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government. Hik5 majesty's Government v/ould do their utmost to obtain the formal acceptance of this obligation by Iraq. If their efforts were successful, and the Iraqi Govemraent were forced to accept the obligation as devolving U::on themiielves, it seems almost certain th ^t they would wish to compound their liability to the Sheikh in very much the same manner as is now proposed. It seems doubtful whether, in such an event, the Sheikh would obtain terms any more generous than those which are likely to be offered to him now, since the atmosphere in which the negotiations wsxld then be conducted could scarcely fail to be less favourable than it is now, when the Iran Government are arxious to please His Majesty's Goveranient by disposing of a question at i^sue be tweenbetween the two Gtovormaenta. 6. If, in the course of direct negotiations between the Sheikh and the Iraqi Government, the iheikh shonld seek your advice in regard to any specific offer put forward by Iraq, you should be careful only to reply to the effect that the Sheikh is him.,elf best able to judge whether the t.rms offered by Iraq are or are not acceptable, and that you are unable to advise on this point. Yo i should, however, without informing the Sheikh that you were doing so, acquaint mo with the terras of the Iraqi CroVsirmaent 1 s of for, aa disclosed to you by the Sheikh. If that offer then appears to ilis Liajaety's Government aa wholly unreasonable, it would be for consideration whether the Higjb Cor:aais;.ioner for Iraq should not be instructed to intervene privately with the Iraq Government with the object of inducing them to offer better termis, but no hint of the possibility of such interveation should of course be conveyed to the Sheikh. ?• A similar communication is being made to the Jheikh of xioweit through the Political Be^idont at Bushire and the Political Agent at Koweit, I am, etc., .For the Secretary of State). i K • s/ • w. • or., &lt; c., T * U B A N.G^Nj?IDi^TlAL. *&gt; *1 M Ho. ?• 185.N/30 N v-'y?

Political Agency. Kuwait. r' 1 / 14th September 1930. i-uj i Z r ,1- ^ypflgii-AL ^ ^ My dear Colonel Biscoe, I received your D. 0. 461-3 of 1st Septem'ber only today, and as you say you are going to write a despatch on the subject of the Sheikh's gardens, I feil I cannot do 'better than give you some further material which I gathereiye^sterday, as a result of a conversation I had with the Sheikh's Wazir and Khan Bahadur ilulla Saleh. The latter has Just returned from the Fao area, where he has 'been for the last month arranging for the sale of the date produce. 2 In my telegram No.291 of 30th August I mentioned that the two main properties involved were the Fadaghiyeh and Fao estates, hut in my D. 0. which followed, I think I implied that thefre two estates were the only ones concerned. In order to rectify any wrong impression that I may have given, I would like to add that the two properties already given, are the main estates concerned. There are actually however 3 more estates, situated to the north of the Fadaghi^eh, which also are exempt from taxation hy Iraq.. These are of course mucK smaller ones and commencing from the south and going north are called The Farl-ariyeh estate originally bought for £T1000/- The Mutaawah estate originally bought for cCX22000/- The Ajairawizeh estate originally bought for £t5000/- . If therefore we add the above values to those of the Fadaghariyeh and Fao properties namely £T80,000/- to £1300,000/- we find that the original value of the properties all together comes to some £!!408 / 000/--2- £t408,000/- This we may call in round figures £-1500,0000/ seeing Laat property has gone up in salue very considerably in the last 50 years or so. 2. The Shaikh's 7/azir who I am satisfied had heen told nothing hy the Shaikh of the coming negotiations, and to ] Wuo,.. I Of course said nothing, was rather in high spirits over the news which had reached him at Fao, that the Ira^ Government intended to take revenue this year in spite of the High Commissioner, (told him by the Qaimakam Shatt-al-Arab), from the exempted properties of the Sheikh of Kuwait and Sheikh Khazaal. laughingly said that little Kuwait had had many similar crises with the Turks over the selfsame properties and had survived them. In those days the Turks objected to Sheikh l£ubarak owmting such huge estates, because they suspected he was in league with the English and was only out to acquire the Shatt-al-Arab delta and eventually Basra, for them. But liubarak had stood no nonsense and threatened the Turks, that if his gardens or fellahs were interfered I witu in anyway (he of course paid revenue), he would attack Basra, and would certainly send armed forces by duow to occupy and defend his properties against aggressior o. Similarly added the wazir today if it really comes I to the point, Kuwait would fight and would not hesitate to send armed forces to Fao if her interests were threatened. Also before she would give up her rights she would call in Bin Baud's aid and launch his laitair and Ajman braves against Basra. He smilirgly added taat he personally could not visualize such a thing happening, seeing that the Kuwaitis had His Majesty's Governments written promise behind them still for the sake ot argument supposing he said Great Britain did break faith and leave Kuwait to her own devices, it must not be thought that the people of Kuwait would take things lying down. I mention the above rather significant and■ H Iand interesting talk as illustrating how strongly the ordinary Kuwaiti citzen thinks ahout this suhject. 8. Thinking the V ( azir # s conversation might have Been inspired 'bluff, I straightaway visited the Sheikh and asked if he had told his official anything about the coining secret negotiations. The Sheikh denied having done so stoutly and requested rae to 'beleive that he had not breathed the matter to a single person as yet. It was far to risky for him to do so. 9* In the meantime there has heen no sign of any move on the part of Iraq.. 10. One very interesting thing, the Wazir said he had gleaned from the Qaimakam Shatt-al-Arah was that Iraq strongly objected to the Kuwait properties 'being held and registered in Iraq, in the name of the Eulers of Kuwait, % and before everything^else his government intended to try and have the properties divided up and registered in the name of each individual holder of the properties (some 200). The Wazir said he thought the idea underlying the plan^ was to be able to gradually ( by pressure persecution etc) to wean or force individual members of the Subah to become Iraq nationals. I myself see in the move an appreciation that Iraq recognises the fact that under international law, they cannot tax the property of an independant Euler. This point as you know the Law Officers of the Crown have made before now, and is a strong one in Kuwait's favour. Your sincerely, (Sgd.) H. E. P.

I submit that methods such as these are not likely to lead to settlement.

Message sent through Hamid Beg, accuracy of which as reported 'by Sheikh I see no reason to douht^ is entirely at variance with intention of Kis Majesty's Government when authorising these negotiations. I suggest therefore that Iraq. Government should he invited to send their offer to Sheikh in writing in the form of a personal and private letter signed 'by Nuri Pasha or other responsible Minister. If this offer is such as can suitably form basis of discussion details / could doubtless be discussed to some extent verbally. I am asking Political Agent to let me know name of estate where embargo on removal of dates has been imposed, aud trust prompt orders will be issued for its removal and Iraq.

I did my best to bring this question to an end in a way that would keep continuous friendship and brotherhood between the two countries. His 2xcelleiicy asked me to convey to your Excellency the respects and affection which he bears to your honourable person, also his best wishes for Your iixicellency' s success in your praiseworthy efforts and for the welfare of the beloved 'Iraq. He^ said however that he could not decide this matter for two reasons: firstly, because the properties did not belong to himself only, but belonged to all the heirs of his late grandfather Ghaikh i-ubarak Pasha as-Sabah, therefore he could not discuss the question of their taxation except after taking the opinion of the adult heirs. Secondly, that the British Government had promised his late grand father Shaikh Lubarak Pasha as-Sabah solemnly to exempt all his properties in T Iraq from revenue taxation. This premise was given as a result of some political arrangement which »7as come to between the British Government and his abovevabovementioned gpandfatii6P, and in accordanc© wltb. CGPtain promises and agreements which had talcen pj^ace between them, and therefore the matter was a diplomatic rather than financial one. Such being the case, it was impossible for him to agree to any request (for payment of taxes), and he asked that the matter should be referred to the men of the Br it idi Govemme nt &lt;, In conclusion I thank Your lixcellency for the confidence you have so kindly placed in me, which has given me nonour and esteem^ I am always prepared to comply with any order of yours which I may be able to performo Usual ending. &gt;ucj -/ ^ &lt;X- *53/ii.

Khan in a recent conversation with the Oriental Secretary to this Legation, mentioned that he had heard from his agent in Basrah that the 'Iraq Government had decided to collect in future the usual taxes from his date groves in the Basrah district. This, the Sheikh said, was con trary to the written undertaking given to him by Sir P.Cox during the war, in virtue of which his date groves were exempted from all taxes as a reward for the services which the Sheikh had rendered. 2. I have noticed in the Hews Diaries from Baghdad that this question has in the past occupied the attention of the f Iraq Cabinet and that certain proposals in con nexion therewith had been discussed but I am unaware that any definite decision has been taken. In any case the Sheikh evidently expects the terms of the document given to him to be implemented whatever the future status of 1 Iraq may be and looks to His llajesty^ Government to see that the promises made to him by the then High Commissioner will continue to be carried out. 3. I beg that I may be informed in due course trhat reply I am to give to the Sheikh. I should be glad to allay his fears as the rent of his properties at Basrah, after deducting the expenses for the maintenance of his numerous family and dependents in 4 Iraq, is all that he has to live on at present and he is naturally anxious to avoid any reduction in these revenues at this stage.4.

Ist October, Ifc Dear sir Robert, Your 'Sxcellency must have seen the agreement which we reached in London concerning the question of the properties of the Shailth of Kuwait. In order to proceed with the execution of the provisions of the said agreement, I privately requested a friend of both parties, Saiyid Hamid Beg al-Naqib, to interview the Shaikh with the object of reaching a satisfactory solutsn in the interest of both parties. It appears to me that, in spite of the means of conviction used by him, Saiyid Hamid Beg has failed to reach a positive result. I also learn, privately, that the attitude adopted by the Shaikh of Kuwait was due to his belief that in insisting he would be able to enjoy a continuance of the present state. As it is the intention of the 'Iraq Government, in the event of no agreement satisfactory to both parties being reached, to proceed quickly with the purchase of the prcferties of the shaikh of Kuwait, I shall be glad if you will be so good as to make him understand the fact of the case through the British representative at Kuwait, before the measures agreed upon in this connection are adopted.

Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.I beg to say that the acting Mutasarrif, the Qaim-Ma^am of Shatt al-Arab, has today laid before the com mittee (Majlis) a very secret order received from the Minis try of Interior. The implication of the order is that a committee should be formed at once to estimate all the properties of the Ruler of Kuwait, and should he fail to pay the revenue tax afterwards, they shall be put to auction, the final bid being accepted only after communicating with the Ministry. After reading this order, the assembly in charge of the Liwa (Majlis) decided on the appointment of five persons, two from its own members, one from the accounts department, one from the Tapu Department nnri the Director of Sibah. Those selected from among the local populace and who are not under the Shaikh's influence, are two per sons, viz Shaikh Ahmad al-Bakr, the President of Abul Khasib Municipality, and Hajji Ghnim al-Earun, and those selected from the Majlis (of Basrah) are Hajji Mustaf bin Hajji Tkha as-Salman, and Mr. Daud Itraghchi. It was also decided that the Mutasarrif should write to the Qaim-Maqam of Sibah and ask him to inform the Mukhtars of Fao and Faddaghiyah etc. to show the committee all the properties of the Shaikh for the purpose of estimation. This is what has been very sectetly decided to-day in the Majlis. Submitted for information. Sd/- Secret Reporter. Dated 13th Jamad Awal 1349 (6th October 1930).Kuwai t, 5th October 1930# Ity dear Colonel Biscoe, I was dining alone last night with Shaikh Abdullah al Salim who has just returned from 10 days in Basra. Shaikh Abdullah said that among the people he met in Basra at dinner was Jardine, The latter at once got on to the question of taxation of the Kuwait date gardens. According to the Shaikh, Jardine was more IRAQ,! than any IRA^I, and said quite openly that not only had the IRAQ Government every right to take its revenue but certainly intended doing so. Shaikh Abdullah appeared nonplussed and a bit upset at Jardine's attitude and the forcible way he made his points and remarked to me that 'Mr•.Jardine did not seem to be an Englishman'. I send you the above for what it is worth. It is- curious and an interesting fact that until Jardine was appointed to Basra, we never had any trouble over this'gardens' question. Yours sincerely, sd/ H,R.P.Dickson.BY AIR MAIL , Confidentia l* D.O.Ho.566-S of 1930» Britlah xiesidencyt Bushire, the 14th October 1930. For some time past 1 have heard rumours that Jardine 9 the /Administrative Inspector at Ba »rah f has been expressing views to the effect that tht ohaikh ol -.Wdi ^ .aac^ no right to claim exemption from taxation on his date gardens As these rumours were vague I did not pay any attention to them. Recently however Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim, a cousin of the Shaikh of Kuwait, was at Basrah and met Jardine at dinner. He told Dickson on his return that Jardine at once ;ot on to the question of taxation of the Kuwait date gardens and stated quite openly that not only had the Uraq Government every right to take its revenues but certainly intended doing so. iou will, 1 am sure, realise, how embarrassing remarks of this nature, when made openly by a British official to a relation of the Lhaikh, are to my efforts to bring about a sfettlement of this difficult question and lull the Shaikhs suspicions. I am of course going on what Shaikh Abdullah told Dickson, but it seems improbable he invented a statement of this nature and if it is correct perhaps you could see yo^r way ii-pi'-ss or. Jardine the desirability of exercising a more discreet attitude in such matters in future.

Mr. Henderson now proposes, subject to the , concurrence of Lord Passfield to address a despatch to Sir R.

These date gardens are larger and more valuable than those of the Sheikh of Mohamnerah. 'ihe Iraqi Govemment are consequently even more anxious to reach an early settlement with the uheikh of Koweit than with the Sheikh of Mohannereh, and would probably not object to the postponement of negotiations with the Sheikh of Wohannerah until those at present proceeding with the oheikh of Koweit shall have reached a somewhat more advanced stage. In any case, the course of any negotiations, which may eventually take place between the Iraqi Government and the sheikh of Moharanerah, will necessarily depend on whether any settlement seems likely to be reached with the Sheikh of Koweit, and on the nature of any such settlement.

Dated the 23rd October 1930• From To Lieutenent-Golonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait, The Hon^le the Political Resi in the Persian Gulf, Sir, In continuation of my telegram No.5l8 dated 23rd October 1930, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of Sayed Eamid Beg al-Naqib 1 ® letter dated Basrah 20th October 1930 to His Excellency the Shaikh on the subject of the latter*s date gardens, 2. His Excellency takes a serious view of the letter and is greatly upset at what he calls the 'insulting threats of the 'Iraq Prime Minister', He yes terday complained to me bitterly that to please His Majes ty's Government he had agreed to receive confidential emisaries from 'Iraq who would in due course appear in Kuwait and make him a money offer for his estates on tile Shatt al-Arab* He had done this much against his will as obviously the taxation question was one between His Majes ty's Government and 'Iraq and it were better for him to keep out of the dispute. 7&gt; 3. He could not really see, he rather for- cibly remarked, why he had been dragged in, for in justice to himself (Great Britain) should either refuse to make any treaty with 'Iraq unless she, 'Iraq, took over her just commitments, one of which was the exemption from taxation of his, the Shaikh of Kuwait's, estates for services rendered, or if she (Great Britain) did not care to adopt this very reasonable line, she could herself pay 'Iraq annually the equivalent of the revenue 'Iraq lost(IK, lost from his and the Shaikh of Mohammerah 1 s estates, or deposit a lump sum to be held in trust by some London Bank, the interest on which would each year cover 'Iraq^ fancied loss in revenue. 4« As regards paragraph 4 of Seyed Hamid's letter and the three questions he hai asked, His Excellency said he suspected Nuri Pasha had himself prompted the questions, as he, Nuri Pasha, would probably like to know the xx answers, even more than he himself (Jhe Shaikh) • 5* Seyed Hamid's suggestion that he, the Shaikh should agree to come to terms with , Iraq and pay re venue on a basis of a Rs 10,000/- fixed assessment, he, the Shaikh, thought was only a 'bait', and he refused to be caught• 6. On the other hand, Seyed Ramid*s apparent frank suggestion at the end of paragraph 5 that he should either get if in w black and white' from His Majesty's Government that they would stand by him and see him throngh his troubles, or else come to terms with ^raq whilst she was amenable, obviously had its effect on the Shaikh, who it must be remembered has, for long, been fed with the insidious propaganda, oft repeated by interested parties of course, that Great Britain only looks after her own interests (dawir maslahta faqat) and if she can get any gain t will mever hesitate to let down her friends® 7. The Shaikh in the meantime would like to know how to reply to Seyed Hamid's latest offer to visit Kuwait again and discuss matters, and I would request your orders on the subject at an early date, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait. ('-True copy of a letter from Saiyid Hanld Beg an-Naqlb, dated Basrah, the 27th Jamad Auwal 1349 {20th October 1930) to His Eaeellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, handed personally to the Political Agent, Kuwait by His Excellency on 22nd October 1930. After compliments: When Nuri Pasha as-Sa f id arrived in Basrah (on 15th -ctober), he again discussed the question of tiif taxation of your properties, and expressed regret that we had not arrived at a settlement # tie in conclusion said ' I have ^iven my promise to the nation that I diall terminate this question of the properties of Hie two Shailchs, and to this end I carried out negotiations with the British Crovemment, and in the obtained a letter from tbem, to the effect that (l'should^be unable to arrive at a satisfactory solution, I should apply to them tlB ^and Acquisition Act and take over the properties at a moderate priae, that is to say at such price as the properties may be xacia valued, under the Act the custom was fee Government to appoint a committee to value the property to be aoquired / and according to the committee's valuation the property taken over by the government, whether the owner be satisfied or not. Therefore, should I not be able to come to an agreement with thetn, (ths Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait), I shall be compelled to take possession of the properties according to the 'Land Acquisition Act of ^raq'. When Parliament opens therefore, I propose putting the matter before tbem, and shall say that either the properties must be taken over at the valuation, or tiie nation should wait till the year 1932, when ♦Iraq will enter the League of Nations. In the latter event the full revenue tax will be taken from the Shaikhs for all the years from 1920 to 1932, according to the revenue figures which the Turkish (Government used to take from them. The property then will not certainly be worth the amount of the revenue demnd' -2- m-3- After making the above statement to me, the Prime Minister requested me to again visit Kuwait and discuss the matter once more with Your Excellency,, Before doing so I asked him some questions which are given below, with his replieso question . Answer, .uesti on * Answer« question.. answer . .uesti on , Should a definite agreement be arrived at between you (the ^aq Government) and the Shaikhs for a payment of a fixed (annual) figure, for how many years can I say the fixed assessment will hold good? This will depend on the law as applied in Basrah. It (the fixed assessment) will be changed, if the existing revenue tax should happen to be changed there, and it will remain unaltered, if the revenue tax should remain as it stands today. The Date revenue tax on the Shaikh of Kuwait's px properties for this year as already estimated comes to about RaSOOOO/- and I happen to know that the produce of dates was 40000 maunds( lit: the farm of the properties came to to 40000 maunds). Seeing also that the market rate for dates today is Rs.2/- per maund, the produce of the Shaikh's properties would all be swallowed up in paying the revenue tax. What 1iien will they ac ffealn if they agree to this? (i.e.paying of date revenue) •'e take from Ihem according to the rules laid down by law and not in,pMce. ihe law implies that the revenue tax is (ox the value 01 the crop) and according to th.is^j(&lt; percentage the Shaikh's revenue tax ought to be sin about Es^lOOOO/- only* the I shall agree to whatever/law lays down, ohould the Governemt increase the Basrah revenue taxes what will be the increased taxation that the Shaikh's property will have to hear?Answer, ^estion . answer -3- {iny The inorease will be similar to that borri by others. Should the Government raise the tax by another Rs^S/- per Jaeeeb (as has been suggested)^ seeing that lliey own about 7000 jareebs, their revenue tax will be raised by another ES.21000/-O This means that it would be trebled (lit: doubled). In that case I am willing that their increased revenue tax should be calculated on taxes they agreed to and not at the proposed new 3areeb rate, that is to say if Government should increase the revenue fcy tax by a quarte: then their increase will be a quarter of their existing reveneue tax, or if she diould increase the tax by a fifth, their increased share would be the fifth of their revenue tax and if the increase be one tJanth, their revenue will be increased by a tenth of Iheir revenue tax, and so on# 3 # I also asked His Excellency whether ^ if I again went to Kuwait, he would give me full authority to act as I thought fit. ^ replied that he would authorize me to do whatever I think good, and that he would agree to ito I next asked him whether any discussion has taken place between him and the British Government after the despatch^ of my last letter to him (i # e # the one reporting the failure of his missior to Kuwait). He replied that conversations had taken place, and that His Majesty's Government had written to the Shaikh three days ago, informing him that the ♦Iraq Government could buy up his properties according to the provision of the 'Land Acquisition Act* 1 . The above conversation is what took place between ' i ■ ^uri Pasha and myself, but the whole question obviously l( connected with the British Government , and I do not like to come to you before I have consulted you, and you take the x±ejc views or -is Majesty's Govemmait in the matter. Should you ^ ■ 4 - JUttBHatfflBBaHboa&amp;i Mfi -4- ■&lt;!LV you desire that I come to you, telegraph to me and I shall set out(for Kuwait) at once, but I strongly advise you to consult tlB British Government on the following points© (a) v ;ill the 'Iraq Government be able to buy out your properties under the 'Land Acquisition Act' whether with or without your consent. (b) Will they legally be able to deiaand in the year 1933, that you pay revenue on your properties as from the year 1920? You should bear in minfl that as yet no law has been passed exempting your properties from revenue taxation, nor has such exeption yet been acknowledged by the 'Iraq Government • (c) If the 'Iraq Government will be unable to legally claim from you revenue for past will they be allowed to take full revenue from 1932, (and onwards), that is to say when the 'Iraq G-overnment becomes independent according to the treaty? 5 0 Should the British Government reply that it is impossible for you to be liable under any of thB above three heads, you should leave the question as it stands^ because the present state of affairs will be better for you and more to your advantage.Should however the matter be different, and you can legally be attached under (a) (b) (c) above, I think you had much better come to an agreement witii them now (Iraq Government) while they are in good and conciliatory mood, and while I am authorized to mediate. It is for you now to decide, and I,act. 6 # The matter will kE of course, be carried 33a± on verbally until basis for negotiations is arrived at between you i and ths Iraq Government, afterwards correspondence will begia. ihren should you agree on a basis of a R3 .10000/- revenue, or thereabouts to open negotiations I shall inform them.

'Patrick Syewart', At Sea, dated the 7th HoTember 1930. / My Lord, y ^ In continuation of ay telegrcua ^o.76, dated Ootc'ber 1930, regarding the negotiations 'between the shaikh of Kuwait and the 'Iraq authorities about the purchase of the latter* s date gardens, I haTe the honour to forward herewith for Your Lordship's information a translation of the letter addressed by Haraid Beg to the Shaikh. 2 # It will be seen that in paragraph 4 thereof the Shaikh has heen adrised to ascertain from the British authorities what the legal position is i® respect of these properties, and in the concluding two paragraphs of the letter he is advised by Hamid Beg that if his position in respect of these properties is unassailable then he should resist the demand of the •Iraq GOTernment. If, on the other hand, his position is not unassailable and he cannot count on the support of the British Government then he woald fce well advised to come to terms with the ' Iraq overnment. Possibly this curious document is an attempt on the part of the •Iraq authorities to ascertain in a somewhat devious fashion what really are the views and Intentions of His • Majesty's Government in this matter, so that thtymay adjufc their methods accordingly, it will be seen that begin/iing The Right Hon'ble Lord Passfield,P«C., His Majesty^ Secretary of State for the Colonies, COLONIAL OiTXGE, L0SD0&amp;.baginning with a rercnue demand of RB.81 f 046/- f whioh was subsequently reduced to £T.4,500/-( Tide nor telegram Ho.71 of the 22nd Septeaiber 1930) tlie 'Iraq authorities are apparently now prepared to reduce the revenue demand to Rs.10,000/-. I hare just had a long conrersation with Shaikh Sir Ahmed and, among other mattere whioh were discussed, His Excellency naturally raised the question of these date gardens. I would venture to recapitulate briefly for the information of Uls Majesty^ (Joyernment the gist of his remarks* He began by reminding me that he had the definite promise of the British OoTernment that these properties should enjoy perpetual exemption from taxation. /hen however he was approached by the Political Agent and asked to enter into negotiations with the •Iraq authorities for the disposal of these properties by purchase he understood that it was the desire of His Majesty's Gorernment that he should do so and in deference to their wishes he agreed, stipulating however that the negotiations should be kept private in the first instance, chiefly because he did i^ot wish the matter to come to the ears of the many other .o ribers of nia family who possess shares in these properties until he saw how the negotiations were likely to terminate and also oecause he did not desire, having regard to his own personal dignity, that the negotiations should become the subject of ill-informed bazar rumours in Basrah and Kuwait. 5. His Excellency went on to say that despite this stipulation the widest publicity had been given to the matter at Basrah. The 'Iraq authorities had be^un by demanding a sum of Hs.81,000/- as revenue from him ( vide my telegram i o.70 of the 16th September to Your Lordship).TrnWIiiiiimaa -3- They had tubaequently put an embargo on the export of produce from tiicee gardens, while the latest move was that the Prlioe i llinlater had nominated a Commission of fire persons to oarry out a valuation of the properties in question* The only people from whom figures eould be obtained were the Shaikhs own servants, stewarie, etc., employed in the gardens, and the Commission were now going round attempting to obtain the required information, while the matter had been publicly discussed in Basrah and references to it had oocurred in the press* Then negotiations had been conaucted through an entirely unoflicial emissary who had made not the smallest reference to the purchase of the properties but had merely raised the question of payment of revenue and had finally, in the letter enclosed herewith, threatened him with forcible expropriation, stating at the same time that His Majesty's Government had authorised the acquisition of the properties under the Land Acquisition Act. The Shaikh stated that it was obviously an attempt to frighten him but in view of the definite promise of His Llajesty^s Government in his possession he was not frightened. He informed me that he was not pre pared to continue negotiations on these lines, and had sent no reply to Hamid Beg 1 s letter* He emphasised that he was an independent Kuler and a man who was entitled to be treated with dignity and consideration, and that he considered the methods hitherto adopted by the 1 Iraq Government were insulting to his personal dignity and more fitted for dealings with a petty shop-keeper than for negotiations with the Ruler of Kuwait. i'ith this Tiew I sutmit pHftk it i. difficult not to .ympathiee. Hi. Sxc.llency went on to .ajr that he was still willing to let'let toygones be toygonea* and if the * Iraq authorities approaoixed him in an honourable man: er with an offer to purchase the properties at a suitable valuation he was ready to discuss the matter with them in a friendly spirit* The question would then be one of prirate arrangement between the Ruler of Kuwait and the Gorernment of 1 Iraq with which His Majesty's Goyernment would not be concerned* If howerer the 'Iraq authorities raised the question of the payment of rerenue, in respect of which he held the prmslBe of His Majesty's Government, he asked that the matter should be referred through the Britiah authorities f and he himaelf waa not prepared to diacuaa with the •Iraq Gorernment any queatlon other than the purchaae of the propertiee and then only if hw waa approached in a suitable aanx er* He repeated that he cunaidered the treatment accorded to him so far as most mortifying to his personal dignity* t* I am inclined to think that if the Shaikh is suitably approached by the •Iraq authoritiea they will not find him wholly unreasonable,though there will have to be give and take on both sides, and not merely on that of Kuwait, in this matter. The Shaikh realises that as long as he has these properties in 'Iraq the 'Iraq authorities will always be in a position to adopt a policy of pinpricks and to make things difficult for him. the five properties, three belong Jointly to the Shaikh and three other members of his family. These, I believe, he would dispose of at a reasonable valuation. The other two properties however are divided among about 100 ahareholdera, many of them poor membera of the /l- u ah family. The diapoaal of theae latter propertiea la ..-5- is a much more dlffioult matter. It will be necessary to obtain the consent of all the shareholders* From these gardens the owners obtain dates, lucerne, wheat, date matting, etc* 9 stc«,and on these thsy and their families and retainers subsist. There are no date gardens in Kuwait itself whieh these owners could purchase in place of the v Iraq properties and cash is of Tery little use to them since they will not take interest and there are few facilities for inyesting It in other forms of property. Many of them would insTitably squander any oash payment they mi^ht receive in a few years and then be left destitute, and Sir Ahmed said that the policy of his ancestors had always been to prorlde for the needs of the family in kind rather than in oash. Howeyer, if three of the properties are sold it is possible that the Shaikh may come to some friendly arrangement with the 9 Iraq authorities OTer the other two prorided the latter adopt a reasonable and accommodating attitude. Possibly they mi^ht arrange for instance to buy out the right of ejcemptlon from taxation. 9« I am sending copies of this despateh to the ^ * (rOTernment of India and His £xeellency the High Coarolssioner for 'Iraq. jcxirf- pji . fro • ty h:- I haTe the honour to be, lour Lordship*• Host obedient, humble servant.

As you are interested in the matter, I am enclosing a copy of the abovementioned commentaries for your perusal. Our previous discussions now appear to have been needless and out of place, seeing that the situation is afe it is. 3^BUNSLATION. n A n CLMJS^d In the course of the debate on tixe treaty certain questions were asked concerning certain clauses and expressions, elucidation of T/tfiich was desired. The Prime Minister received and replied questions on these points as follows 1. In regard to the provision in Article 1 for complete consultation etc., it was explained: This clause is confined to affairs 4»f foreign policy and to foreign interests common to the two contracting parties, namelyl economic and commercial (or trade) affairs being outside the scope of this article. 2. With reference to Article III of the treaty, in the event of dispute between Great Britain and any of 'Iraq's neighbouring States the British Government will act in consultation and in agreement with the 'Iraq Government, in the same way as the 'Iraq would act if the dispute was between 'Iraq and another State. 3. The facilities and assistance to be extended by 'Iraq under Article IV of the treaty will be at the cost of the British Government, nothing to be borne by 'Iraq on this account. 4. The 'Essential Communication' of His Britannic Majesty*s Government referred to in Article V (2) are air communication over 'Iraq, as well as ma rine and air communication at the head of the ^ersian Gulf. 5. The reference to air bases in Basrah or the vicinity thereof occurs in the English text in the plural number because there is no dual number in Shglish. The number is as stated in the Arabic text and in the official statement issued on 1st July, 1930, by agreement between the negotiators.6. The British Forces, the maintaining of which is allowed under Article V(4), are purely air forces with auxiliary services. 7. The British Government have no secret treaty or instruiiient relating to 'Iraq, that falls with in the meaning of the expression 'International Ins truments' occuring in Article yTII(2) of the treaty# 8. The total strength of the 'Iraq guard mentioned in Clause 4 of the Annexure does not exceed 1250 men. 9„ In explanation of the expression 'move ment of forces in transit across T Iraq' occuring in Clause 7 of the Annexure, the direction of this movement iB transit has been defined as from the West of the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf or vice versa.TRANSLATION. INTERNATIONAL COVENAi^TS. The ^raq.

COEiFIDEETlAl* Sir, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 11th Eovember, 1930 u' In Sir R.Olive's telegram Uo.E09 of September 6th, relative to the date gardeis in Iraq, of the sheikh of Mohammerah, he explained his reasons for advocating that this question should not be pursued further with the Sheikh on the lines indicated in my despatch Ko.416 of August 15th# P / X K As you are aware, negotiations are at present proceeding between the Iraq. Government and the Sheikh of Koweit concerning date gardens in Iraq belonging to the latter. These date gardens are larger and more valuable than those of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. It is probable, therefore, that the Iraqi Government are even more anxious to reach an early settlement with the Jheikh of loweit than with the Sheikh of Moharaaerah, and would not object to the postponement of negotiations with thebheikh of M oh arm e rah until those at present proceeding with the sheikh of Koweit shall have reached a somewhat more advanced stage. In any case I consider that the course of any negotiations which may eventually take place between the Iraqji Government and the Sheikh of Mohamroerah will necessarily depend on whether any settlement seems likely to be reached with the sheikh of/ R.C.Parr, Esqt., etc., etc., etc., TEHRAK.(jl of Koweit, and on the nature of any such settlement. In these circumstances, and in view of the considerations p' W m advanced in Sir R.

This 1 append in the form of a separate note, together with certain other information given me in the course of my conversation with the Shaikh, which you may find helpful in taking over the matter with Sir Francis Humphreys: I would suggest my note be read however in con junction with:- . i iK V'c (a) My telegram No. 291 dated 30th ^•|&gt;t.l930.

' 4 # For your information and to assist you in your discussion, 1 might add that the Shaikh is entirely adamant as regards the Fao estates. He will not hear of any suggestion for the sale of this property, it is 'the pearl without price' he says as far as Kuwait and the al.Subah family are concerned, and Kuwait will go to all lengths before she will even think of parting. So we must, I fear, rule out all discussions regarding this estate from the start. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H..V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.Regarding the remaining four estates, tlie Shaikh, are that, (a) He is agreeable to sell the Ajairawiyeh and Farhaniyeh provided he is offered his price• He believes he can persuade the members of the family to part, both for the sake of peace with ^raq and because he recognizes it is policy to meet His Majesty's Government half way in the matter. (b) As regards liie Mata'uah and Fadaghiyeh estates, which are the property of Mubarak's 4 sons (Jabir, Salim, Nasir and Hamud). The » Shaikh is very loth to discuss any sale at all^ because it means 'forcing' his cousins to part, which they will certainly be averse to doing. In other words he is afraid of causing serious dissension among the principal members of his family / and his chief supporters today. Nevertheless I gather he is prepared to discuss the question of their sale if really pushed^and I believe he feels strong enough to carry it through. I myself would advise however that of tbte two properties t he be asked if necessary to sell only the Muta'uah estate, and that the Fadaghiyeh be left out of the discussion.(a) Name of Estate . I.

(i) Properties are numbered in order of size: (ii) Taxes paid on Fao property does not include area recovered from sea since British occupation nor on 390 garaibs which originally were good lands but were destroyed by inroads of sea. (iii) Value of ITao Lands approximately £.T.300,000 if we take figures given by Wazir last September. (iv) The Turkish Pound being calculated approximately on its present value in Kuwait. ('b) Of the properties mentioned in paragraph (a) Nos. I, III and V are owned by all the members of the al- Subah family, some 100 souls. V/hile II and IV are owned only by the four sons of Mubarak (Jabir, Salim, Nasir and Hamud and their children J. (c) By old established custom, and general desire of the male and female manbers of the al-Subah family, all the gardens are managed in the name or the Rulers of Kuwait. Each year the Ruler disposes of a portion of the crop to merchants in T Iraq or abroad, and the unsold balance of all the produce of the gardens, he has sent to Kuwait where it is stored in the state warehouses. The Ruler then pays out their shares to the various membersmembers of the family (approximately 100) in the following manner• To each person male or female . (1) A salary ranging from Rs 1200/- p.m. to Ra 10/- p.m. (2) A ration of 120 mds of 'Saiyir' dates and 120 mds of 'Khadrawi' dates (once p.|i a. and immediately after date season). (3) A daily ration of Lucerne grass. (4) A daily ration of meat and fish. (5) A monthly ration of Firewood (date branches) Wheat, Tibbin (bhoosa) Ghi, Hay, Char coal, Rice, Parafine, Coffee, Barley, Sugar, Karabs, Tea, Palm-mats. (6) Presents of clothing and frocks to both sexes on occation of Id. (d) Actually according to the Shailch each member of the family gets much more than his actual share or 'haq' under the above arrangement, for only a portion of the salaries granted comes out of the sale of the produce of the gardens, and in lean years when gardens fail to bring in enough to go round, the Ruler is bound to make up the dificiency by purchasing in the bazaar, as was done this year (1930) for instance. (e) A-part from the articles mentioned in (c) (5) many other advantages are obtained from the gardens such as palm lo^s , grapes , peaches , nectrines . kaseel melons etc. etc. when in seaso#.* These all form portion of the shareholders' 'haq' and have to be distributed, after the fellah has taken his share. (f) Again during the date season, many Kuwait families visit the gardens for a change of air, and as often as not settle their slaves on the property (fieed or otherwise) this is a greatly valued priviledge among the members of the al-Subah family. ^Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.^3 Private &amp; Personal * Mohammerah, the 23rd j- nuary 193!• I have just returned from Baghdad.

I hpve had a long conversation today with the Shaikh, regarding the date gardens. I explained to him that as it was not possible for him to sell all the properties arid the s le of some of them would not satisfy 1 Iraq, and the treaty had now been ratified, etc.,the matter wrs one which, in our opinion, should be settled between the two Govcrnmtnts. I conveyed to him Kur^s expression of regret for Kamid Beg 1 s letters rnd then said that as a preliminary to a discussion between the * Iraq and British Governments, it was essential th t we should ascertain the extent of our liabili ties, i.e. the taxes payable on the properties; and in order to do this it was necessary that an assessment should be carried out. At first, the ohaikh objectea very strobgly to this on the following grounds: he said that, had the negotiations for the purchase of the properties been carried out, as was intended by His Mzjesty's Government,secretly and without any publicity, he would have had no objection to an assessment of the properties, to which,similarly, undue publicity need not have been given. But the 'Iraq authorities so f^r from keepin t the matter quiet had given it the widest publicity, first of all, they had sent orders to the Uutasarrif to levy revenue; then, they had put an embargo on the export of dates, and it was only as a result of our intervention that these measures had been frustrated. Finally, Huri Pasha had announced publicly ••• Lxcellency, Sir Francis H # Humphzy8,G.C.V.0 # 9 K.C.i^.G., K[.3• £&lt;., C.X.ii., H.li.ii's High Commissioner for 'iraq, BAGH^Ai)publicly in Basrah that it was the intention of the 'Iraq Government to end this exemption, and had nominated a committee of five perBons to carry out an asscBsnient of the propertxes. I believe tn &amp;tf as a ruatter oi fact, some oi the persons vfhom Hurl Pasha nominated refused to act# Anyhow the whule matter was one of common icnowledtie and gossip in asrah, anu everyone knew the efforta tnat Iraq were iiakingt and was also aware that up to tht present His majesty's overi.ment had intervened on the Jhaikh's behalf. If now it was known, as it would be,that His Majesty's Government had authorised an aeseesment, then, everyone would at once jump to the con- elusion that the britiah authorities have yielded and Nuri Pasha had won the day ana the Jhaikh felt that his personal 'izaat' was involved in the issue* The Shaikh admitted frankly that it was a question of what he regarded as his personal prestige, and I cannot help feeling a good deal of sympathy with kim in the matter. The action of the 'Iraq authorities has teen not merely tactless, but offensive. Hurt himself admitted that he had threatened the 3naikh with forcible ejepropriation in order to bring him to a suitable frame of mind# However, I 1inal^y got the Shaikh to a^ree to an assessment if a representative of yours or a British ori'icer oi some sort, preferably an official from Baghdad ; was aseooiated with it# you think it would be feasible to arrange this? It seems to me that Kuri might be reminaed ihat in Young's letter 2io#i # 197 of the 2na SeptemDer 1930 to Ja'lar iasha, we particularly asked that the negotiations should be carried out in secrecy and that the emissary should not divulge the nature of his business to any person other than the two Shaikhs, ana i i ! Ja^ar Pasha was told that any publicity would be likely to nhave # • •I m\ X. n ^ /i 7 have a damaging effect upon the progceee of the negotiations. Despite this they have given the widest publicity to the matter, and it Is entirely on this account that the Shaikh is now making ditficuXties about the assessment* Sec &gt;nuly f this assessment is being i ^aue with the object 01 fixing the liability of the British government, and it seems not unreasonable there fore to (i sk that the British Government should be represented i on the assessing committee. In the Shaikh 1 s eyes it would mak€ an enormous difference t since the presence of a British rspresentative would ahow the public that the British Govern- raent were still iaieresumg themselves in the matter, and the Shaikh considers that it would make an entirely different impression on the public mind. I hope therefore that you will be able to get the 'Iraq authorities to agree to this. I should like you to read through again the letter addressed by ilamld Beg to the Shaikh, of which a copy was forwarded to you under my printed letter Ko.2o~T of 8th November 1930. The statement contained in the first portion of that letter was not made to H^mid Beg alone, I bclievt, but also to other persons who reportea the matter to the i&gt;naikh. Anyhow unless Nuri Pasha denies the accuracy of his own -fcaisaary*s s statement, he haQi deliberately made a false statement, and it might be a useful argument to uae in getting him to agree to the presence of a British representative on the assessing commi ttee. k ' / kh ^ i-y F'' m m W' l_ H ibf fa-, I J Extract from Private and Eecsonal letter dated the 31st January 1931 to 3• # 'iowe3-l I • • I &gt;Foreig^ oecretary to the Government of India,New Delhi. # • • • • Humphry a and 1 hav® howavar now oome to tha oonelualon that It ia uaalaaa to try and affact a aattiement of the da a ardant ^uaatlon by purohaae# The iha^kh ol l u^alt oannot aell the Fao proyartiea# and Clva bad report- ad that If the queation of the aale la moot€»d to the Shaikh of Lohacuarah it may be a final blow. «»e are then fore both agreed th t the onl^ solution la for the ;aattar to be diaouaaad between the * Iraq ana : ritlan GoTtrrnxaenta* -here are certain aapaota of the Biattar which it la very dii f icult to put on pa par f and which I ahould Ilka to dlacuao with you, and after 1 hare done ao 9 Humphry a and I can both discuss it with the Colonial Office when we are at home ' next summer.53/ i 1 Telegram R. - Froiri * H.M's High Commissioner, Baghdad. 10 Iolitical Resident, Bushire.

His appointment should emphasize British connection, and the Political Resident hopes that In the circumstances the Shaikh will feel satisfied about the matter. I am further to explain that the assessment is being arranged for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of our liabilities which is a matter for concern between the ^rsq and British Governments, and does not affect the ohaikh, other than indirectly. For this reason it is immaterial from the Shaikh's point of view whether the assessment is hi.^h or low, and therefore the ohaikh has no ground really for objecting to Hr.Jtrdine 1 8 nomination. \c 4^ Lt.Colonel H.-l.P.Dickson,C.

Copies of th4s letter have been sent to the Foreign Office and the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd)J*G. Laithwaite* To The Under Secretary of Statet Colonial Office. I/•.&lt;o the treaty has now been ratified without any agreement having been arrived at between 'Iran and the Shaikhs, we are back arain where we started. A direct settlement is really out -of the question. The Shaikh of Kuwait cannot sell ---1' the properties, and a sale of some only would net suit 'Iraq; the proposal to buy the Shaikh out //as a 'face-saver* for 'Iraq, since the value of the exemption from taxation co^ld _e included in the purchase price without attracting corm ent, A partial sale would not effect this, Shaikh of -iohammerah would be seriously affected, if purchase mentioned. The only way to settle the case is by discussion between the 'Iraq i nd British Governments. 'Iraq, argue as follows: .{ (i) the services rendered by the Shaikhs ^rimarily served | the interests of the British Government, Their services to 'Iraq have been compensated by pa^'ments to date viz. £ 125,000, and His Majesty's Government have up to the present paid nothing. (ii) Under the Organic Law no exemption from taxation exceeding a year can be _xven. A special law would have to be passed every year, and no Prime Minister could possibly get it through. (iii) They are willing to go to arbitration: their legal i advisers tell them they will win. His Majesty's Government do not v/ish to go to arbitration. The result would be doubtful, and in any c ic se it would-) certainly look bad. It , r o^ld be in the interests of the Tnaikh that we should . .. : 1siioula lose. If we won, we could no'- stand aside (at any --ate as far r.s is con cerned) since neither Shaikh, lu s any t-i - ns c. 'bringin^ diplomatic pressure, and Kuwait is a protected state.

The High Commissioner for 'Iraq, Paraphrased copy of a telegram Lio,128 dated the 5th of March, 1931, from the High Cocunissioner, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, regarding date gardens owned by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muharamerah,Telegram, From, To. Dated, No. Addressed London; copy 'by tag to Pushire, ■* Recently I have discussed with Colonel Biscoe and Nuri Pasha the question of the date gardens owned by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammerah and, for reasons given by the foriaer, I am satisfied that it is useless for the Government of ! Iraq to attempt to purchase these gardens, since, as Biscoe points out, they now belong to more than a hundred relatives of the Shaikhs, who depend on the pro- C dues for their maintenance. The matter threfore becomes one for settlement between the Governments of Great Britain and *lraq, and my suggestion for a solution is on the fol lowing lines. The gardens should be re-assessed by the * Iraq authorities, in the presence of a British official, at a considerably lower rate than the present assessment, and the new assessment should be capitalised. Present assessment of £^,800 (the total of both properties) might be reduced by the Government of f lraq to say £6,000. This sum would be paid annually by the Shaikhs to the 'Iraq Government as revenue, but a lump sum representing the capitalised value of this annual payment would be paid to the Shaikhs in full settlement of their exemption. If the lump sum were shared equally between the Treasury and the Government of India, an approximately equal contribution from all three Governments would be involved, which seems to be not inequitable. Continuance of exemption is con trary to 'Iraq law and is fiercely contested every year in Parliament, Arbitration proceedings, even if acceptable to the Treasury, would be derogatory and the award might - Paraphrased, ordinary, - The High Commissioner, Baghdad. - The Colonial Office, London, - 5th March, 1931, - 128.Bin . , - - well go againfet His Majesty's Government. Exemption was ^ granted, so I understand, in return for protection of the Persian oilfields, of British interests in Basrah and the Shatt-al-Arat, and of the interests irf in the Persian Gulf of the Government of India. I have already approved the assessment of the date gardens with the concurrence of Colonel Biscoe.

I invited ?itjcoe to Baghdad in January to diecuec the question, wc talked over the case with &gt;uri 3 asha and came to the unanlmoun conlousion that it was useless to pursue the suggestion i ado in London that the Rirdens should be vrivately acquired by the f Iraq Soverimient. Biscos pointed out that any such attempt would be futile 9 if only because the Kuwait wardens wer* now owned by more than loo persone i many of whom depended on their produce for th^ir livelihood. It was therefore sug* gested that the question of purchase should be definitely dropped and that a re-asfiesment of the e iraens should take place *1/eaiately, Biscoe s^iid that he was visiting Kuwait before the end of January and would try to obtain the foraal concurrence of the shaikh to the re -assesstoent* He afterwards wrote to me that the rhaikh would &gt; ot y aear huif/b »• 2 • objection, proTided that a British offlw was a®»oclat«d in th« a0ei&lt;ifiRin«nt 9 and I haT« Toa^a arrany^i^wlth rurl Fasha that thl• should V&gt;« dona* The ld«a is that tha aasasfifasnt airiould !•« substaritlally reduosd and uri ?asha pointed out that ths pr «»©nt was a favouratls opportunity owing to the low prise of dates.

His Majesty's Ooverniient hold that this Is an Intsrnatlonal obllp ^tion which devolves on •Iran under the new Treaty. The •Iraq Ocvomnent, on the other hand, strongly contest this view. They point out that the exemption Is contrary to their law and every year It raises a etorm of protest In i'arllaiL^nt curing the Budget debate. ihey say that although the exemption was granted on behalf of His kajesty^s Go wnweiit, in actual practice the 'Iraq (Jovemmsnt have had to bear a loss of al^out ^Bo # 000 to date. They say that whatever assistance the two Shaikhs may have rendered to the liberation of Uraq frosi Turkish rule has been rewarded by the payment of this suip , and they point out that Mr Henry Dobbs omitted in 1924 to Include these exemptions as mnonr the inters national obliKstlons which would eventually devolve on •Iraq* They hold the view that permanent sxewptJon is an unconscionable arrangement and doubt Whether any Ooveriunent would honour It In perpstulty, evsn In thecave of national horooe* They foel strongly that the ft«rTio«» in return for «hioh the Shaikhc were granted this exemption were eerrloes rendered to Hie ttajepty*s GoTernifient in oonnection with the protection of the Fereian oilfields and of their intereetsi in the Per« eian Gulf, no lean than to the t iraq Government. 1 have given thie case moet careful ooneidiration and 1 feel that it might be poeeitle to reneh a final settlement fair to all parties concerned, oh the lines contained in my teli^frr^r No# 12fi.

Dear Sir Francis, With reference to past conversations between Your Excellency and myself on the question of the properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait, I very much regret to infarrra Your Excellency that in spite of all the efforts which I have privately made with the object of prevailing upon the Shaikh to sell his properties to the 'Iraq Government, or rather of settling the question of 'property tax' (sic) on the lands of the two Shaikhs, my attempt fcas proved unsuccessful. I now find myself compelled to approach Your Excellency with the request that you will lend this question the attention and interest it deserves, and to reconsider it with a view to its settlement, in view of the fact that discussions have been going on for about seven years without any definite result being reached. If your Excellency will be so good as to go through the files on this question, you will find that every 'Iraqi Cabinet that has been in power has dealt with this outstanding question and done its best to settle it. I am certain that Parliament will 'open wide the door of discussion' on this question, upon the submission of the current or next year's budget, and, as you are aware, I have taken upon myself, personally, responsibility for suspension of the collection of the tax due, in respect of which orders were issued by the v Ministry of Finance with the concurrence( or support) of the Council of Ministers. I should be exceedingly grateful to Your Excellency if you would find your way to solving this question at the earliest possible opportunity. Please accept, etc.. Yours sincerely, Sd. Nuri al Said.

I have now looked into the question a little more carefully, but it seems to me that the new proposals are so unlikely to prove acceptable to the Treasury and the India Office that it.is hardly worth calling a meeting of the Sub-Committee to discuss them until we know whether those departments are prepared to consider them at all. You do not say in your letter whether you have consulted the Treasury and India Office. It is possiole therefore that you may have been waiting to do so until you knew our reaction; but I am inclined to think that it would be-well, before we go any further in the matter, to hear whs t the Treasury and India Office have to say about tie ^ropos. 1 in liumphrys* telegram Lo.x28 of rch 6th, seeing how closely the/ are concerned.

I was very interested in your remarks about the attitude of the Government of India towards sharing part of the cost of compensation, which will presumably have to be paid to the shaikhs. This question will have to be fought out between the India Office and Treasury at home, but I see little prospect of the Treasury agreeing to shoulder the whole burden, especially as I 'believe the Government of India have recently turned down a demand made by the Treasury for a further sum in connection with expenditure outside India incurred during the War, It seems likely that the Government of f lraq will shortly abolish the revenue taxes on dates and all agricultural produce and will substitute what they call a Consumption* tax, which means that the middleman or exporter will pay lo% on what he buys or exports, but the producer will not have to pay on what he eats. The effect of the new law, if it gets through Parliament this session, on the question of the Shaikh's date gardens is being examined in my office and I propose to discuss it at home.

Thete two ;irden« f together, represent both in area and Talue orer 90f of trie wnole properties under conpideration# The remaining three gardens ore presumably thofe referred to in paragraph 6 of Colonel Biecoe's confi dential deepatoh No.?7A d^ted the 7th of Nov^aaber, 1950, ae belonging jointly to the Shaikh and three other mbribers of his family. They are comparatively email in siie. It is the larger estates which dominate the problem, and which in my opinion effec tively rule out as impracticable any attempt to purchase thorn by private agreement. 4. The schedule attached gives the detailed informa tion asked for in Your Lordship's telegram of th^ appro ximate annual output in produce in value and in kind of each of the five properties, anri aleo the rate and amount at which revenue would have been demanded from them had not the exemption from taxation been operative. In considering the figures of produce and the value of produce contained in the schedule it should be reraem- _ bered that they are not based upon actuals and can only be relied upon as a rou^ guide. They cover, for instance, only the date crop, whereas a quantity of grain« y M ' — ~ ^ /% 0* ^ain is al^o rai^^d on th# lands, of which no &amp;ccount» is taken in the oaloulations* Also ths conversion of Ihs quantities into oash is cooBplicated by the annual fluctuations in the value of dates. The assessed value of the produce as given in the schedule is based upon the prevailing market prices of trie 1930 dete-crop. These prices /ere little hi^er than half of those which prevailed during the preceding year. Thus, in twelve months the estimated annual value of the produce has dropped frow Rs.lO to Hs.5 lakhs, and it is not possible to forecast the future trend of prices. 5* .axation on the Basrah date gardens is at present levied in the form of a fixed cash rate per jarib or unit of area. The rate varies according to the olassification of trees in the area, i.e. there is one rate (Hs.14/10 per jarib) for an area containing a preponderance of full bearing trees, a lower rate (He.9/6 per jarib) for partial-bearing trees and there are two other classifications of area on which no tax at all is levied. The rates are fixed and have not been altered in Basrah for sixty years. The classi fication of the units of area comprising the ♦fardens under the four categories would certainly change whenever a new survey was made on account of the development of the trees in thera. Up to 1924, the figure of demand upon the five properties of the ^haikh o: Kuwait, prepared upon an inspection made prior to the• 4 - th« Britirh Occupation, fftood at th« equivalent of Re#67 i 856. An innpaction and a rou^i racla«Bifi- cation of the garrlenf! in 19?4 rai^ftd the amount of the ravenu# demand to R««7B t 500 per annum. No reolRPi?i fication hap wince been carried out and the anount of af?e8 c m«nt r&lt;^ain« at that finare. It ie importrmt to note that the increaee in the revenue demMnd i^ not the result of any slter^tion in the rate, or tne banis of taxation, but if consequent upon the natural transition of date bearing trees from one pta^e of growth to another. 6. The 'Iraqi OoT^rnm^nt hnve reduced the rata of demand on date gardens by 67if during the current year because of the abnormal fall in the value of dates* Taking this into account the taxable demand on the properties under consideration during the present financial year would b^ no more then Hb .33,?78. The contemplated change in the method of taxation of date gardens whereby taxes will not be levied upon a unit of area but upon the produce brought to market, will materially affect the consideration of this problem, and I shall be glad to be given an opportunity of dieoussing this aspect of it during my stay in England. 7.

The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these proposed changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ. In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's intention to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.Much of the correspondence in the file discusses whether or not this assurance can be upheld and how the British should react to the Iraqi government's desire to tax the produce that is grown on Shaikh Ahmad's land and then exported to Kuwait. The file contains direct correspondence between British officials and Nūrī al-Sa‘īd, the Prime Minister of Iraq.On folio 153 the file contains detailed information regarding how the produce and revenue of Shaikh Aḥmad's gardens were divided between members of the Al Sabah family.On folio 214 the file contains a statement regarding the size of Shaikh Aḥmad's land holdings in Iraq and an estimation of their annual produce and revenue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001cb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
