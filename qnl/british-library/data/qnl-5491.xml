He has already officiated as Consul-General, and win be well-known to Persian notables in the district who would expect to have an opportunity of calling on him. Again, once he has taken over as Political Resident, an announcement will have to be made to enable him to happen to Hay in the interval (which you recognise might be a fairly long one) before he can establish himself at Bahrein or somewhere on the Arabian shore. /exercise J«Tbyne Henderson, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l.; •} r .: 0 exercise his authority on the reb shore; been done the Persians can hardly faU to draw the conclusion that the Residency is going to be aiovtd.

As the Government of India will certainly consult you I should appreciate any support the India Office may feel disposed to give. I think the latter are under some obligation to me for initiating the proposals for my deputa tion last October which, as I told Sir David Monteath, could not have been more inconvenient or inopportune from my point of view. It is also possible that my deputation may be specially useful this year as all the Trucial Coast oil agreements are likely to become active now and P.C*L. will have a number of questions to raise after their winter’s working. j E.P.

It is therefore absolutely essential for me to have leave* and if I cannot have long leave then I must have short leave. It is relevant to add that the aotion of Government in placing me on deputation fo r a month at the conclusion of my last leave without any reference to me cauaed me the greatest personal inconvenience and could not have come at a store unfortunate time for my private affairs* I feel therefore that 1 am entitled to some consideration on this account.

We agree to this appointment and you will be interested to know that Bullard has telegraphed to us that he would regard the appointment of Hay as a very good one. With regard to the proposal that we should seek the Persian Government's agrement for Hay's appointment as Consul-General, Bushire, you will no doubt have seen that our Secretary of State has written to yours recommending that the Political Resident should be 1 withdrawn from Bushire in the very near future. If, as we very much hope, this recommendation is accepted, the question of applying for an agr&amp;nent for Hay as Consul-General will not arise, and, pending a decision on this point, we think it better for the present not to approach the Persian Government.

CONFIDENTIAL O Dear Baxter, I enclose copy of a telegram from the G-overninent of India recommending that Lt.Colonel William Rupert Hay, C.S. I., C. I.E., at present A. G-.G-. in Baluchistan should be appointed to succeed Prior as Political Resident^in the Spring of 1946. As you know. Hay officiated in the Persian Gulf four years ago and gained quite a reputation there. He is rather older than we should have liked,but there is a dearth of younger men with the requisite qualifications and we think that,on the whole, he is the best choice. If you see no objection, we should be grateful if you would send instructions to H.M./H.M. Ambassador, Tehran (to whom the Government asking him to seek the Persian Government s agrement for Hay’s appointment as Consul-General, Bushire. . i understand that Prior intends to take long leave from 1st April next and that day, ^ will take over soon after that date. of India's telegram has already been repeated) Yours sincerely, &amp;/ Minute Paper. extebnal Department. A**) *{1 Mr. Dqpaldson Appointment of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf You will see from the Government of Indian telegram No. 10536 below that they are proposing to replace Sir Geoffrey Prior in the Spring by Colonel Hay. The Government of India do not appear to have consulted us informally about this appointment as they have done on previous occasions (see papers in the file below) and have repeated their telegram to Tehran. In view of^ ^ H.M.G*s interest in the Persian Gulf which now An inwertant mittrrn of policy n°that of the Government of India, we have in recent years adopted the practice of consulting the Foreign Office informally on this appointment. Colonel Hay officiated as Political Resident from November 1941 to October 1942 while Sir Geoffrey Prior was at Cairo. Apart from that spell he has had no experience either in Arabia or Persia. Nearly all his time has been spent on the North West Frontier except for a. spell as Counsellor at Kabul from 193^- 1936 and as Deputy Secretary, External Affairs Department from 1936 to 1940. A possible alternative to Colonel Hay would have been Colonel Galloway (bom 1901 and 8 years younger than Colonel Hay). He has served as Political Agent at Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat, as Consul-General at Ahwaz from 1943-44 and has recently been acting as Political Resident during Sir Geoffrey Prior* s absence on leave. He has thus very considerable experience on both sides of the Gulf. He was, I happen to know. Sir Geoffrey Prior* s own recommendation for appointment as his successor. I do not know \ however whether you think it is desirable to take the question \ip further with the Government of India, (if so, perhaps a private telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy would be the best channel). z&amp;yAi- U.S.S. ifseems to have been agreed in 1932 that in view of the close interest of various Imperial Departments in the post, the Secretary of State should be consulted before the Viceroy reached a decision. On this occasion the Government of India have telegraphed officially their proposal to appoint Colonel Hay, and leave H.M.G. only an opportunity to raise objections. I do not think that we could well object to Colonel Hay’s selection although (a) he has not a very high Arabic qualification and (b) he has only another two years to serve before attaining the age limit of 55 . Sir G. Prior was definitely in favour of appointing a man of v* under 45^0 could hold the post for at least five years. Assuming however that it will be decided to accept the Government of India's proposal, I attach a draft D. 0. letter to the/ iTTo (11704) Wt.2t569t}/K282 10,000 9/39 A.&amp; KW.Ltd.

It is submitted that this should be agreed to.

As you are probably aware Prior’s five years term as Resident in tne Persian Gulf will be completed on the 31st August next and the question of arrangements after that date now therefore fall to be considered* 2. So far as can be seen, there is no other opening for Prior either on the External or Internal sides at First Glass Residency level; nor is there at present any officer who stands out as having particular claims for consideration as his successor. 3. In these circumstances the Viceroy is willing to consider the grant of two years'* extension to Prior and has noted that the extension proposed is balanced in part by the fact that nearly one year of his current tenure of office was spent in Cairo. Under strict interpretation of the rules this period counts towards his five years, but we feel it can justifiably be taken into cqnsideration now that the question of extension has arisen. It is true that Prior is not due to retire until 1951 and it would theref&lt;pre be possible to allow him a full 5 years extension of tenure in his present post before he r attains/- iatt ains t he agef of su nerannu ation, but, apart from the possible unwisdom of expecting an officer to serve for a continuous spell of ten years in so bad a climate, it seems undesirable to enter into commitments so far ahead. 4. Before passing orders His Excellency would be ^lad to know whether the Secretary of State would see any objection to the course which he proposes; as our general postings position is likely to be affected by the final decision in this case it would be helpful if your reply could kindly be telegraphed. I should aai that no approacn in the matter has been maae to Prior himself. H.I. Peel, Esquire, QBE., MG. • JLV^s^JL) J- -1 ~ j —• • y # y Secretary, External Department, India Office, London.

This would presumably involve employment of Prior as officer on special duty at Bushire with such allowance as would minimise financial loss to him.

A change of the incumbent of the post does however present an opportunity for the matter to be raised by the Iranian Government in the least offensive way possible.

I have ncrhad a reply from him confirming that there is no objection to your letting your friends know unofficially that you are designated for this oost. The actual announcement of your aopointment, which would be by an official communique' here and in India, would follow the receipt of the Iranian Government's agrement to your appointment as Consul-General, Bushire.

The Government of India are accordingly considering with us and the Foreign Office the best way of dealing with this possible contingency.PSHSONAL New Delhi, the 6th Feby. 1939 Many thanks for your letter of the 30th Jany. about Prior T s appointment to succeed Fowle in the Persian Gulf. So far we are concerned, there is no objection to Prior letting &amp;&amp; know unofficially that he is designated for the Gulf. Most people know it already and he will not be divulging a secret. The question of making an official announcement on the subject is somewhat more difficult. I mentioned it to the Viceroy this morning and he said that he thought the proper procedure would be to have a simultaneous official communique on the subject in England and in India. There would seem however to be considerable objection to any such official announcement being made until the Iranian Govt, have agreed to the appointment as Consul-General. I enclose a copy of a Despatch which we have just received from Seymour in reply to our official enquiry whether he saw any objection to Prior ! s appointment. As you will see he has agreed to the selection, but declines to make any move towards obtaining Iranian Govt. T s Agre'ment until he receives instructions from H.M.G. We will address the India Office officially regarding this as soon as possible. But you will no doubt agree that it will be better to make no official announcement until this fence has been negotia ted. I do not myself know exactly what importance to attach to the probability of Iranian objections. Fowle has, so far as I remember, always thought that the Foreign Office and Legation fears were exaggerated, but he may of course be wrong. We do2 not seem to have heard anything for a long time about the pro posed readjustment of financial charges between H.M.G. and the Govt, of India in the Gulf - a question with which that of the transfer of the Residency is somewhat closely linked. Do you know at all how this matter is getting on, or have H.M.G. been too busy with more important problems to give it their atten tion? The question would of course become of immediate importance, if it were necessary to clear the Political Resident out of Bushire at short notice owing to the impossibi lity of getting the Iranian Govt. T s agrement to Prior T s appointment as Consul-General. Yours ever J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, London.(COPY) Wo.12. (188/2/39) British Legation, Tehran, 27th Jany. 1939.

Fowle. 2. I see no objection to the selection of Major Prior for this post. 3.

H.S. the Viceroy has now considered the question of a successor and has decided that Prior should be aooointed to succeed Powle, when the latter vacates the post. Prior is at present employed as. Prime Minister, Aiwar State, and will vacate that appointment towards the end of September 1938. lie has put in for leave from that date and it is proposed to grant him ll months leave, which w ill enable him to take over from Powle by the 1st of September 1939. This appears to H.H. the Viceroy to be a satisfactory arrangement and he proposes therefore to give Powle another extension of 13 months which will take him up to the end of August 1939. Powle does not reach the retiring age of 55 until November 1939, so that there is no particular objection to granting this extension particularly in the present depleted state of our cadre. The proposal to appoint Prior to succeed Powle in the Gulf has already, I understand, formed the subject of correspondence between the Secretary of State and H.E. the Viceroy through the private and personal- 2 - personal channel and agreement has been reached regarding it • His Excellency however considers that it would he as well tor the matter to be placed on an otticial footing and I am accordingly to request that, if the Secretary of State agrees with the Viceroy’s proposals, his formal concurrence may be communicated in order tnat Howie and Prior may be informed accordingly.

Many thanks for your P. &amp; P. letter of the 5th March regarding Fowle’s extension. You will no doubt have seen, since you wrote your letter, a P. &amp; P. letter sent by the Viceroy to the Secy, of State early this month on the same question. As you will observe, His Excellency has there pointed out that Daly’s claims were given every consideration and that he has definitely preferred Prior for the appointment when it becomes vacant. It must after all be remembered that it is a First Class Residency and therefore purely a selection post, so that Daly, although he might find it difficult to understand that he was not selected, could not have any cause for complaint. x x XDear Colonel Daly, Mr. /alton is away on leave until the riddle of this month, and 1 opened yoar letter to him dated 29th larch, in which you notify your address. e have made a note of the address in the 'apartment, md 1 have sent your letter on to Walton.

Rendel on the subject of the succession to Colonel Fowle. He said that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was exceedingly grateful to Lord Zetland for his courtesy in consulting him about this appointment. Hr. Eden has no objections whatever to raise to the appointment of Major Prior, which he would welcome. The only point which had occurred to the Foreign Office - and Sir Lancelot wished it to be quite clear that they only put forward the point with diffidence, and did not m any way wish to press it or to interfere with the discretion of the India Office in this matter - was that it might conceivably be practicable to keep Colonel Fowle on even a little longer. He is in every way s£. admirable that they feel quite sorry at the prospect of his going. I explained that Colonel Fowle reaches the age of 55 in November 1939, and that this would therefore in any case be the latest date on which he would have to retire. The proposal to extend him till the/the ari&amp;afm of 1938 was, I thought, merely made from the point of view of convenience in postings, etc. I said, however, that I would of coarse mention the point here and make sure that it had been, or would be, carefully considered before anything final was done. Sir Lancelot again repeated that the Foreign Office did not press the point in any way, and that, if the Secretary of State for India felt that Colonel Fowle should go at the end of 1938, as was proposed, they did not wish, nor, indeed, bad they the right, to interfere in any way.Mr. Rendel returned to the Foreign Office to-day. I saw him and explained the position regarding the succession to Colonel Fowie. He said that he had come back from the Gulf much impressed with the atmosphere of unpopularity which Colonel Daly had left behind him both in Ira» and in Bahrein, and he wasEXTRACT from private letter from Lord Zetland to Lord Linlithgow dated 22nd March 1937. 4. In paragraph 5 of your letter you deal with another case of an appointment of some importance, namely, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Prior is certain -ly a young man to hold a post of this character, but I should certainly see no objection to his appointment on that ground, and I have no adverse comment of any kind to make on your proposal. I think perhaps that I should mention it to the foreign Office in case they desire to make any comments since, as you know, they like to be kept informed as to appointments in that part of the world, and I am taking steps accordingly.Tajor Prior is a good man. He has served m the Ga w lf as Secretary to the Resident, and as Political Agent at Bahrein (April 1929 - December 1932). In 1933-6 he was Deputy Secretary m the F. &amp; P. Dept. He is of coarse yoang for a First-Glass Residency. He will be 42 in December 1938, with 13 years to go before he reaches the retiring age. This might create a postings problem after he has completed his five years' tenure (since it would be very questionable to contemplate keeping a man for 10 years in one post in the Gulf); but the chances are that there will be no difficulty in absorbing him in some other high appointment when the time comes. The Viceroy has formed his view after full consideration, and I think we should accept it (after we have sounded the F.O., which is desirable in the case , of this appointment). It will be remembered that we suggested, m a letter whicn crossed, that uoi. Daly's qualifications should be considered. The Viceroy has, however, already made up his mind that iie is definitely unsuitable, one reason given being the unfavourable impression made by some correspondence/correspondence last year about the Kashgar post. We have not seen this correspondence, and the reasons for so decisively rejecting Col. Daly are not quite clear. As regards the I eshed incident referred to, the view taken at the time was that Col. Daly was not to blame. The Viceroy may perhaps have come to the conclusion on general grounds that he is unsuitable. In any case we should, I think, accept the conclusion. -vIEXTRACT from private letter from Lord Linlithgow to Lord Zetland, dated 5th torch 1937. 5. I have had under consideration the forthcoming vacancy in the Persian Gulf Residency, and I have gone very carefully, with Metcalfe and Glancy, into the records of the various officers concerned. I know how important this post is, and I am most anxious that we should find a really first class man for it; I have carefully considered the records of the possible candidates. I do not in the result think that Wingate, though I recognise his ability, is the man we want. Daly, while he has certain qualifications, I should regard as definitely unsuitable. I was unfavourably impressed by correspondence which took place last year in connection with his proposed posting to Kashgar and (any difficulties which he made for us at Meshed with the Persians apart) I should be strongly opposed ^o entiusting to him the post now under consider ation. The field, for practical purposes, and omitting Loch, who does not, I think, carry the guns for the permanent post, narrows itself to Skrine and Prior, and of the two my advisers have unhesitatingly expressed the view that Prior is definitely the better man. He is, it is true young, though I am far from considering that a drawback once, as in the present case, I am satisfied that the officer concerned possesses the requisite qualities of character and the experience to fit him for the post under- ? - © consideration; and I have had no hesitation in forming the conclusion, which is shared by metcalfe and Glancy, that he is unquestionably the best man available. I attach the more importance to Glancy’s judgment in that he is very reluctant to lose Prior of whom he has apparently formed a very high opinion. He has, however, asked me to agree if 1 possible to leave Prior in Alwar until December 1938, and I have told him that I am ready to do this and to extend Powle up to that date (I had already extended Powle for one year - up to the end of August 1938). I am conscious that Prior is a young man for this responsible and exacting post, but I am impressed by his language qualifications (for I see that he is a first class interpreter in both Persian and Arabic), and by the variety and scale of his experience, and from what I have seen of him I would judge him to have not only energy and balance, but to possess the personal qualities which are requisite and which are, in my opinion, likely to be of special importance in an area with which so many different forms of administration are actively concerned. I do not however contemplate, at any rate at this stage, that Prior should spend the balance of his service in the Gulf, ue are short of first class men in this department, and what I have in mind is that after a period of five years in the Gulf he should come back here, whereit would be of use to us to have available the experience he has gained. Much of course may happen in the period of time which I have mentioned which might lead our successors to takea different view when the moment came* j but I mention the point so that you may not think that I am contemplating his spending an indefinite period in that exacting climate which makes such demands on a man both physically and mentally. I hope, in the light of what I have said, that you will feel able to accept my view as to the succession to Fowle.? 2- C S * ^V- ' A3, Sir L. ./akelv , Sir F.

I asked whether he would like me to send personal enquiry to Sir A. Letcalfe about his prospects, and he has since telephoned and said that he would. I would therefore propose to do so in the terms of the attached draft letter, which is self-explanatory.

I presume that his service as iolitical Agent, Bahrein, in 1921-6 was a success, and that he would be persona grata there (looking forward to the time when the Residency will be transferred from Bus hire to Bahrein;. I gathered that, having regard to his past service, he would find it difficult to understand it if he were passed over for the Gulf appointment unless, as he put it, there is something against him which he is not a^are of. As regards this, there were the difficulties wttb/with thw ahKu in 1936 which srosc out oT intpl^uws against him at Mashed; hut the Minister was satisfied that &gt;aly was in no way to blame, though ffnatehbull- Hugessen indicated to you in November 1935 that It would be wise, on account of the Persian attitude, to move him when an opportunity occurred. Daly appears to be quite unaware that this was the motive for ?3oving him from Meshed. If we are satisfied, as we were, I think at the time, that Daly was in no way at fault, the Persian suspicions ought not, perhaps, to tell against him now. It is true that on account of this incident the Foreign Office (though they have little or no locus stand! for objecting to any appointment that the Viceroy chose to make) might perhaps regard him less favourably for the incumbency of the post at Bushire, but if Fowle stays till 1939, the Residency ought to have been moved to Bahrein by then, and even at the end of 1938 there will not be a long Interval before it is possible to make the move.The Immediate object of Dely’s call here was to get some indication of w.dere he stands, in order to decide what to do about his leave* He knew that Fowle desires extension; if this were only for one year, or if Fowle were extended till 1959 but took long leave before retirement, Daly, if there were a prospect of succeeding him, would ask for the conversion and extension of his present leave to the necessary amount of leave on half pay. He said that if he is to convert his present six months* leave on full pay, he ought to do so fairly soon. I, of course, pointed out tnat postings are a matter for the Viceroy; but said that I might write personally to you to ascertain what his pro&amp;pects are. T should be grateful if you could let me have an early line on the subject. S«U -J. a WALTON^ e5 “ M ' m7 Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with my letter oi 6th February about Fowle’s extension?

I think it is agreed that he is undoubtedly able, and on the score of experience and knowledge of vrabs, apart from grounds of t seniority, he would evidently be a strong candidate. Indeed, he is something of an .urab specialist. Daly recently called here for c*A, ** quite^personal talk, he told me that it had always been his ambition - a legitimate one, of course, considering his capacities and expoaence - to succeed eventually to the Gulf Residency.

Daly stated that he had been a candidate for the Political Dept, about 1910-11, but was unsuccessful because he was married. From 1917-21' he was engaged in political work in Iran. In 1921 he was specially appointed to the Political Dept, (three years’ advance in seniority being given); he said that he received a letter from the Foreign Secretary stating that he was appointed on the understanding that it would only be possible to employ him in Persia, Arabia or the iN.Y/.F. From 1921-6 he was Political .igent, Bahrein; this period covered the deposition of Sheikh Isa, the accession of Sheikh Hamad and the appointment of Hr. Belgrave, whom Col. Daly recruited, as Adviser. In 1929 he was appointed to Seistai and in 1932 to I’eshed on the amalgamation of those posts. In 1936 he was transferred from I eshed and asked to proceed at once to Kashgar, when due for leave; he was advised by his doctor that he was not fit for travelling at high altitudes (old mild cardiac lesion), and should be within reach of skilled treatment; he telegraphed accordingly and sent a medical certificate to this effect; letter crossed with one from Foreign Secy, rather brusque ^demanding a certificate. Col. D. was irritated by r the tone of this and correspondence ensued - rather brisk at first, but the matter was smoothed out later. Col . D. does not know Sir A. Metcalfe person ally . Transfer from Persia apparently put on ground (apart from Kashgar proposal) that he had served five years in post ( viz .. Seistan), and no mention was made of Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s view, given privately to Sir A. 1etcalfe m November 193b, that m Iconsequence of Persian attitude it would be wise to move hoi. D. when an opportunity occurred. I therefore said nothing about this.i Col. Daly’s ambition has always been to succeed to the Bushire Residency towards the end of his service, since his experience has all been Arabian and Persian. In 1936, on the Kashgar proposal fallin through, a post m Baluchistan % was suggested to him, but he took leave instead (one year, including six months on full pay, from November 1936); he has much more leave to his credit and could convert present leave to two years on half pay, but if he does this, thinks he must decide before full pay leave expires. The object of Col. Daly’s call at the Office was to seek advice privately as to the prospects of his being considered for the reversion of the Bushire Residency on Co±. Fowle vacating it. he knows that the latter desires an extension, but he thought dates might tit if the extension were only for one year, or if Col. '• took long leave be j. o.e retirement and Col. D. extended his leave. Col. D. wants to have some indication of probability because of leave question. Col. Daly evidently has a feeling that he has not bee a very well treated, and if he were not considered tor tne Calf appointment would find it difficult to understand, the reason, especially in view of the letter sent to him in 1921 on hi appointment to the Political Dept., since there is nothing, that he is aware of, against him m his previous service. (He is obviously suitable for the Gulf appointment on grounds of seniority, experience and .knowledge of Arabs.) he wondered whether he was ruled out by.a recent Political De circular which apparently indicates that previous service Secretary to a first-class,Resident or eputy Secy, m the Foreign Political ept. would ■ Ci i.i' sppointments &lt;to irst Class esmencies. . as 'Wv.

It would also be quite agreeable to the F.O., whom I consulted informally when Fowle mentioned the matter to me last autamn (see my p. and p. letter to you of 9th October).

I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from Powle regarding the possibility of his being given an extension beyond October 1937 when he is ordinarily due to retire. I cannot trace any letter from you on the subject, although I have an idea that you did write saying that you thought that the Secretary of State would view such a pro posal with approval. I have not yet mentioned the matter to the Viceroy, so that I would ask you to regard this communi cation as unofficial and I should be grateful for a reply before Fowle comes here next month ; when I could discuss the whole matter with him after taking His Excellency’s orders. The posit ion,as far as we are concerned, seems to be that we have nobody at present to put in his place except possibly Loch or Ytfingate or Prior. I am doubtful whether Loch is really suitable for the permanent appointment and I have hopes of being able to dispose of him otherwise. Wingate would, I think, be good, but he is taking long leave next autumn and it would certainly suit him well enough if he succeeded to the Persian Gulf appointment in the autumn of 1938 when he could still serve his full 5 years. Prior though undoubtedly competent is still rather junior and he could I think do his full 5 years if he succeeded Wingate. HowHow do you think that in view of these considerations the Secretary of State and the Foreign Office would regard an extension of one year for Fowle in his present appointment? Yours sincerely. J.C.Walton, Esijr., C.B., M.C., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, Whitehall, ’ London. S.W.T,Extract from private and personal letter to Sir Aubrey letcalfe, dated 9th October, 1936. XXX I consulted the Foreign Office informally about the question of extending Fowle’s tenure till he reaches the age of 55 m November, 1939. They are quite cordial in agreeing that this would be a good step. The only difference which they have with Fowle is that they would like to tighten up British control of the Uulf States, while Fowle (quite rightly, we think) is opposed to forcing the pace. They naturally look at the problem mainly from the international point of view, whereas ^owle, and, I think, no doubt the Government of India, are more impressed by the desirability of avoiding undue interference in the internal affairs of these States. here The only doubt which we/at the India Office have sometimes felt about Fowle’s handling of Gulf politics is whether he is not occasionally too brusque m his method of approach to the Sheikhs. But, if so, this is a very small matter compared with his many sound qualities and the advantage of continuing to make use of them and of the great experience which he now has of Gulf problems.

But I think we both agree point and pointsti out that a public announcement that I do not think there is much room to doubt that/that it would he desirable to make some communication course would be that it should be made orally on the general lines that we very greatly regretted that an Immediate appointment had to be made in the Persian Gulf and that we understood that he was unlikely to be able at present to return to the East, with the result that another choice had had to be made.

This is satisfactory, for the Legation had for some reason, the nature of which la not quite clear either to us or to the Foreign Office, anticipated difficulty in securing the recognition of Colonel Fowle as Acting political Resident during Sir Hugh Biscoe's projected absence on leave. It was thought probable at this end that the difficulties arose over the Persian if* objection to granting temporary commissions^) to officers who were merely officiating in posts in the temporary absence of the substantive incumbent.Mr. Walton, With reference to the Viceroy's private telegram below about the succession in the Persian Gulf, I venture to suggest that while Mr. Gould is the senior and in some respects, as the Government of India say, probably the better qualified officer for this very important post, the balance of advantage definitely rests, as the Viceroy rather suggests, with the appointment of Colonel Powle. He is, it is true, rather junior in the Department, but that is largely because he joined it rather late. He is of the appropriate rank (Lieutenant Colonel), and in point of age (bom 1884) is of the right standing, without being too old to make it impossible for him to complete a long period as Resident. As the Viceroy says, he has specialised in Persian and Gulf work and has the advantage of experience (and distinguished service) at Aden. He is an interpreter in Arabic and Persian and the importance of these linguistic attainments is particularly great at a time/time when there is so much to he done in the way of O direct negotiation with the chiefs of the trucial coast and the like* Further, he has not only served as Secretary at Bushire, hut he has at various times, as will he seen from the note of his services attached, been employed as Political Agent, Bahrein and as Political Agent at Muscat, while he acted as Resident in the Persian Gulf for six months last year successfully. Mr. Gould, who has secretariat qualifications and a considerable knowledge of Persia, has no Arabic language qualification and no Gulf service. It might perhaps he added that at a time when the Imperial Departments are so closely interested in Gulf affairs there is some advantage in having a man as Resident who is easy to get on with and who is well seen by them. From remarks made by representatives of the Air Ministry and the Colonial Office since the death of Sir Hugh Biscoe there seems every reason to believe that both those Departments would welcome Us appointment. The Foreign Office have no experience of him/5 „ r 1 him (save during the period when he acted as Resident last year), hut are unlikely to have any strong view. So far as is known he got on quite well with the sailors.LlfiUXygQLQNflu*..li Q .f W &lt; FOMi C&gt;B.g &gt; Bom: November 1884. Joined Political Department: 1914.

Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram No.1941. Successor to Biscoe. 2. After careful study of all possible selections, I consider the following two officers merit particular consideration. (1) Lieut.Colonel Fowle, now officiating,. He has since he joined the Department specialised in Gulf and Persian problems and is an interpreter in Arabic. He has been continuously employed in the Persian Gulf since November 1929 and is thoroughly familiar with local politics and personalities. Unfortunately Biscoe left no opinion of him on record and I am not personally acquainted with him, but I am impressed with the report recorded by Sir S. Symes in 192u after Fowle had acted as Resident at Aden for a few months. The report reads as follows - 'Fowle handled a difficult and potentially dangerous situation on the Yemen Frontier energetically and with excellent judgnent. He is an officer ofmarked ability, has good political sense, discretion and an understanding of native mentality. His character and capacity2 capacity for work have earned the esteem and liking of his British colleagues and tribal chiefs of this Protectorate.' (2) B.J. Gould, X.C.S., now acting as Resident in ./az iris tan. He has never served in Persian Gulf, but served with great credit as Consul, Sistan from 1918 to 192^ and has adequate knowledge of Persian. His confidential reports have been uniformly excellent and he possesses an experience of larger problems and of contact with H.M. Government gained during the three years he spent at Kabul Legation asCounsellor and Charge d f Affaires. He is eight years senior to Fowle and is better equipped for secretariat side of Residents duties. I am only doubtful whether he possesses sufficient personality or decision to overcome tne unfamiliarity with problems and persons which would confront him, and for this reason I am disposed to recommend Fowle as the best choice. 3» if you wish for other names I can suggest Skrine or ^ngs^who are just senior to Fowle and have experience of the G - ulf or of Persia. Both have, however, many years of service to go and I do not consider that it w °uld be in the interests of Government or in their own to promote them now to a first-class Residency. 4-. I should be grateful for your views as soon as possible.JGB/MM * i O O L ^ ■ o * v. V (16 wx'&amp;u) 3^19 D EGO D E l From A jh* ,T^ E_L^.

Sir Hugh Biscoe will he a very great loss to the Department and his e death while bn route for Shargah to endeavour to clinch the agreement which he had been negotiating with the Shaikh about facilities for the Arab Air Route comes at a particularly unfortunate moment. The Secretary of State has, it is understood, writ1Ten personally to Lady Bisco'^. The expressions of sympathy which the Government of India desire to be conveyed might, perhaps, most suitably be conveyed in a demi-official letter signed by the Under Secretary of State, a draft is attached. It will be seen that the Government of India have instructed Colonel Powle, at present the Political Agent, Muscat, to take charge pending further orders. The question of the successor to Sir Hugh Biscoe is not an easy one. The obvious candidate for it is Lieut.Colonel C.C.J. Barrett, C.3.I., C.I.E., now on leave from the post of Consul General, Meshed. Colonel Barrett has had long experience at Aden; he recently held all the three agencies in the Persian Gulf (Koweit, Ba^ein and Muscat) and has officiated as Political Resident Unfortunately, he has been (Invalided with what appears to be abdominal cancer. If there is the least chance of his being passed fit in the near future it would be well worth while holaing the post open for him. If the medical report is adverse it will be necessary to look further down the list for a successor to the late Resident. Colonel Powle 3000 5 31 has/has strong claims, hut is relatively very junior. Another possible name is Lieut.Colonel Loch, now a^ein, who is posted as Political Agent, Ba, e^Roidorahly senior to, though younger than, s Colonel Powle. The appointment is in the gift of the Government of India, hut its importance from the point of view of the Home Government is so great that there is something to he said for asking the Viceroy privately to give the Secretary of State an opportunity of commenting before any final decision is taken, I ^ /Ua ft 1 ? /U $ /* lA-.
