Beference correspondence ending with Government 0± foreign and Political Department memorandum Ho.P.35~E/29* dated the 31st May, 1930, on the above subject. Mr. H. Taylor of the Indo-European Telegraph Department was originally engaged by this Residency as a temporary Cypher Clerk on a consolidated pay of Rs.350/- p.m., viz., pay Rs.250/- plus Duty allowance Rs. 100 /- and free quarters. On my recommendations, contained in my memorandum iMo.32-8., dated the 1st February 1930, the Government of India were pleased to sanction the permanent retention of the post of the Cypher Clerk on revised rates of pay with effect from the 1st April 1930 viz., pay Ss*250-10-350/- plus Rs.5Q Special Pay, Bs.25/- Compensa tory allowance and Bs*40/- Bouse rent in lieu of free quarters. When the post was made permanent it was after some consideration decided that Mr. Taylor should not be appointed to it, but should be kept on on a temporary basis until a suitable permanent incumbent could be found. Considerable delay occurred in obtaining the services of a clerk possessing the special qualifications required for this post, and willing to serve in the Persian Gulf, finally, however, the services of a suitablesuitable person were obtained and on the 15th December last he assumed charge and Mr. Taylor reverted to the Indo-European Telegraph Department. As Mr. Taylor was continuing to serve on a temporary basis he was given pay at the temporary rate, i.e., pay Rs. 250 /- plus duty allowance Bs* 10 G/- with, free quarters* ib.e Ac count ant-u-eneral, Gen tral Bevenues has now ohjectei to the payment of the Special Pay at Bs* 100 /- p*m* instead of Bs*5Q/~ and has asked me to furnish him with sanction of the Government of India to the payment of the Special Pay at the increased rate of Bs.lQO/- p&lt;&gt;m. It will he observed, however, that, in reality, Mr* Taylor has only been paid Bs*25/- p*m*, in excess as the compensatory allowance of Bs*25/» p*m* sanctioned was not paid to him* In view of the special circumstances mentioned above, and in view of the fact that I think it would be unfair to Mr. Taylor to reduce his pay, while actually he was being retained on a temporary basis, I request that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the the payment to him of special pay at Bs.100/- p*m*instead of Bs*5Q/~ with effect from 1st April 1930 to 15th December 1930, the date he reverted to his permanent post; or as an alternative to change the date of sanction of the post of permanent cypher clerk from 1st April 1930 to 15th December 1930 which would automatically adjust the matter.

P. 4066, dated the 8th September 1927, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,Ho.T.11 dated the 12th December 1927, setting forth further reasons in support of the above appointment. 2. The Government of India endorse the views of the Political Resident. The Residency at Bushire is 7 miles out of the town v/hich increases the difficulty of entertaining.lt is a large building with many suites of rooms, most of which are generally occupied by official guests, such as the Political Resident’s subordinate officers, of whom there are nine, all but one within fairly easy reach of Bushire;officers of His Majesty’s ships in the Gulf which spend a good deal of time in Bushire, and an increasing number of visitors of standing. In addition the normal entertainment of the local community, including as it does high officials and other Persian gentry and foreign consular officers, all of whom expect formal attention especially on arrival and departure, is both heavy and difficult to cope with without special assistance. In view of the circumstances now explained, the Government \Governiaent of India trust that the necessity for a Persona! Assistant to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, will be admitted and the retention of the post for a period of three years in the first instance from 1st January 192?,moiety of the cost being borne by Imperial Revenues, will be approved. 4. As the period for which the post was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in August last will terminate on 5ist December 1927, I am to request that his further orders may kindly be communicated by telegram. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant for Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

Appointment of Personal Assistant to the hon«hle wLe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to Foreign and Political Department letter x^o.47 (2)-E, dated the 7th October 1927, on the subject ol the retention of a Personal Assistant for this of Residency. It is suggested that I should give additional reasons for the retention of this appointment. The appointment is one which exists in every First Glass Residency because it is a necessity and it would be an anomaly if the Persian Gulf Residency should be selected for an exception since with its execrable climate it is I think more necessary for the Political Resident to be assisted in the work which a Personal Assistant performs than even elsewhere under the Indian Government. I would however put forward one point which probably escapes notice. The entertainment of numbers of guests, the big dinner parties of from 20 to 30 people which have to be given and the preparation for such events all fall upon the wife ox the Resident who is thus performing Government work; though not officially considered in any way she is an unpaid u-overnment, official. After a dinner of the British community to meet the newly .appointed Persian Governor in October last my wife frankly told me that without a personal assistant and with the thermome ter at 100° and a damp atmosphere she could not undertake to re- m ' ; peat such an entertainment, it is quite obvious that X cannot do it and it is equally obvious that the Under- b e cretary cannot leave the cyphering and decyphering of telegrams and his other work in order to see whether things have arrived for the dinner and whether the details of the dinner are correct. If'‘'—V If my wife is away in Sngland the argument is equally strong. .But in my official capacity I must give big dinners to the Persian officials and to Foreign officials and to the British community: and 1 fail to see how a Resident of the First Class can keep up his position and prestige unless he is supplied with a Personal Assistant; the line of least resistance would be to neglect the outward show which is so necessary in an Eastern Country in order to impress the local officials and chieis and to make work run easily with the Eastern. * I would also note one other point. In a bad climate like the Persian Gulf where men are apt to go sick the Personal Assistant forms a reserve for cyphering for the Under Secretary either when sick or Yvhen he relieves the Secretary. If one Secretary is to carry on the work of two men while the other is sick it means he is overworked in a climate where overwork means ultimate sickness- a point which 1 have proved with my Indian staff apart from my European staff• The cost to Government of a Personal Assistant is small since the Resident keeps and feeds him- indeed he probably costs the Resident more than he does the Government. In the circumstances I trust the appointment will be maintainedfurther communication bject, please quote K 10767/10767/234 to any person by name, ider-Secretary of State,” r 'oreign Office, London, S,W. 1. 4066 C'', Foreign Office.

As the charges on this account are divisible in moieties between the Home and Indian Revenues, and the annual expenditure involved exceeds £ 100, the pre vious approval of the Secretary of State for India to the expenditure should have been obtained. It is regretted that the necessity for doing so was inadvertently overlooked, and I am to express the hope that the Secretary of State for India will now kindly confirm the action of the Government of India.

I heve notea while in Inaia that Agents to the Governor General are allcv/ea a personal assistant by Government, ihe necessity; in Bashire is far greater than it is in inaia for while, so Colonel Pricieaiix infarm^lme, the number of guests Wao are repaired to stay in the Residency is greater than in India, no hotels are available. The time of their coming and going would make their reception too great a strain on an officer who has regular office caities to perform, as the mail steamer, which lies seven miles fron the town^et o A.M. Tbe launch takes an hour to an hour ana a half to reach the mail end. when the weather is bad passengers have to travel out by sailing dhow as the launch becomes unsafe. Thus It is necessary for guests to leave the Resicency at 4 ^0 &gt;30 in the morning. The arranging for their arrival and departure and seeing them off has hitherto been done by Colonel priaeaux* private or personal secretary. These and the other duties which this gentleman performs, those normal to a per onal assistant, the regulation'of entertaining, issue of invitations, cha rge of the house and of camp furniture which give him a full time day, are entailed entirely by my official position and have no private interest. Yet I have found it necessary, as Colonel Prioeaux did, to have some one to assist me. TimIn one cincamstances I trust you will agree to the appoint inert of a personal assistant for this Besioency as in other 1st class Residencies. The pay in India for this appointment is Rs. ICC or Rs. 150 per sem. It would hardly be possible to get anyone to remain in ’lushire under Rs. 200 per mensem am I would request that this amount he sanctioned. I nave kept on Colonel Prideaux*s private secretary Mr. C.H.A.Bagshaw, an M.A. of Keble College, Oxford, aged 35, who is eminently suited for the appointment. I would accordingly ask that the appointment be sanctioned from the 1 st January 1927, the date on which. I assumed charge. The amount cue for the current financial year can be met by reappropriation but as .the end of the year is very near I would ask for early sanction by telegraph if possible.H t L (fa h #• FOREIGN OPPICP.

FOREIGN OFFICE. S.W.l. 29th October, 1926 Sir, ¥y attention has been drawn to the question of the extent of the superintendence exercised by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire over consular posts within his consular district, which comprises 'the Provinces of Fars 'Khuzistan and Laris tan and the district of Lingah, and the 'coast and islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the 'Dominion of Persia'. 2. Taken literally the definition of Lieutenant Colonel Prideaux’s consular district would presumably entitle him to exercise supervision over the following consular posts:- Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Ahwaz, Mohammer&amp;h, Shiraz and possibly Kerman. Bunder Abbas and Lingah are given on page 74 qP the current Foreign Office List as subordinate to Bushire, and have always been regarded as directly under tne Consul- General’s superintendence, 3. Since Ahwaz was transferred in 1925 from the Indian to the Levant Service, the Consulate is treated as being independent of the Bushire Consulate-General, except perhaps as regards the administration of the Indian code under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. As stated in foreign Office despatch No. 382 of August 10th, 1925, . . v to the Ahwaz Consulate, although as Mohammerah is subordinate to tne T + financial matters and accounts of the Vice- an Indian post a.11 iinancic.x , .-i+v, through the Consulate-General at Consulate are dealt with tn... l Bushi re. 4. e Honourable Harold Nicolson, C.M.G., etc., etc. , etc. , Tehran. iA 4. It appears that in practice Shiraz, since its transfer to the Levant Service, has become independent of Bushire, except perhaps as in the case of Ahwaz, as concerns the administration of the Indian code under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 5. The position of Kerman with regard to complete independence of Bushire is not clear, and I shall be glad to receive your observations on this matter as well as on the whole question dealt with in this despatch. I am, etc., (Lor the Secretary of State) (Signed) E.P.

Subordination of Consul-General to Minister-is one of Motifs in Despatch. I am sending Minister copy direct.

I have the honour to state that I am in receipt of your telegram No. 1479-S., dated 19th July 1927 (Serial No.^2), directing me to give an answer to Minister's endorsement No. 103, dated 11th December 1926 and with which was forwarded a copy of Foreign Office letter No. 476, dated 29th October 1926 (enclosure 1 of Serial No.J^) of which I attach a copy, on the subject of the jurisdiction of this Consulate General. 2. The Minister’s query arrived just as I had taken over the appointment and it is I think obvious that I could not give a satisfactory answer to so important a question a fortnight after assuming charge. I accordingly asked the Minister to give me time. 3. Having considered the question at leisure I found that my opinions differed considerably from those expressed in the letter, both as to the question of fact, and as to the necessities of the Persian Gulf. But it seemed to me for reasons that will readily be seen that the opinions to be expressed by me should either be condemned or supported by the Government of India before they were put up at all, and in my despatch No. 61, dated 19th May last [Sub-enclosure s (l) of enclosure (2) of Serial No. (3)] to the Minister I gave expression to this view. 4. The point at issue has never since been absent from my mind, nearly every question arising affects it; the appointment of the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, the rupture with Russia and the consequent anticipated propaganda amongst the Indian Staff of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the denunciation of the Treaties bv the Persian Government, have each had their bearing upon the questions to be answered and I have felt that six months residence in my post was not too long a time for delay in considering the points which are connected with so lar-reaching 3/ decision 5. I think it may be taken as a general axiom of politics that anything which has gradually grown into existence nas a definite reason or i s grow ™ generally speaking, the most practical way of meeting w a las o e 0 ’ ^ new conditions may modify the result achieved and may even necessitate chan . 6. The position of the Resident of the Persian Gulf, and *V^Vat^due to^the he possesses, have grown up gradually during the las o years ma ; n i v j n the important position of the Persian Gulf in our Empire .f Pe r s an politics and safety of our Indian Empire. At no time in its history has the Persian Gulf been more important to us than it is to-day. , I have said that I have disagreed with the letter and S 1926 (enclosure 1 of Serial No. 3), from the Foreign Office, both in tact policy. Let me deal with the two questions separately. p orcl ’ aT1 n oas ts and 6.

The points to be noted m ^^'^“^th regard 6 to Bushire, Lingah mg Ahwaz, Muhammerah, Shiraz and Ke , &amp; and Bandar Abbas no remark is required. — ——77 enclosure IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No. 0 9 5Vi - Dated \ SEP. 1927 Received 19SEP.F 7 V4 8 As regards Ahwaz it is stated, in paragraph 3, that since the post was trans ferred’to the^Levant Service the Consulate is being treated as being independent of the Bushire Consulate General, except in regard to the administration of the Indian Code. This I would respectfully submit is not, and cannot be, the case. The fact of the transfer to the Levant Consular Service makes no difference to the status of the official holding the appointment, or the power under which he acts “ f or the maintenance of order or for the control of or administration o’ persons or property or in relation thereto ” which powers “ shall be exercised underand according to the provisions of this order so far as this order extends and applies ” (article 6 Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council). 9. The reason that an Order in Council was brought in at all was owing to “ the insufficient power of control possessed by Her Majesty’s servants in Persia over British Subjects ” and in order to terminate _ “ an irregular jurisdiction for which there was no proper authority and which might at any time be called in question by the parties affected.” Remove the Order in Council and the situation reverts to the conditions to which objection was made and the only regular jurisdiction and “ control over British Subjects ” the only power “ for the maintenance of order or the control or administration of persons or property ” which the Consul at Ahwaz possesses disappear and he has “ an irregular jurisdiction for which there is no proper authority and which can be called in question by the parties affected.” The same applies to precautionary measures necessary to prevent any such religious disturbance between the Hindus and Mohamedans as have recently occurred at Lahore (article 23 sub-section 2). 10. Now this authority is not confined only to the code and it does not become his by virtue of his commission as Consul, since the power of Consuls as such are so limited as to be practically nil, they are his by the powers which are possessed by “ the Consul General or an officer subordinate to him either as such or as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ” (article 58). 11. In all his dealings with the members of Anglo-Persian Oil Company the Consul at Ahwaz is acting under me and if I am to maintain my control as required by the Order in Council these matters should be reported to me by him. That this is my opinion not only as a matter of fact but as a practical necessity will follow In my general remarks. 12-' The above remarks as to “ fact ” apply with equal force to Muhammerah and to Kerman. 13. feniraz appears to me to be m the most extraordinary position. The Consul of that place has been appointed to a post within the jurisdiction of the Consul-General, within the limits of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council and yet the present incumbent is not authorised to act under that order. i s ^ ar as .^ can see ev ery action of his within the power conferred by that order, is ultra vires, and he has no power to exercise any control over British Subjects, no power to register British Subjects (registration can only take place by a regula- xon under this order issued by the Consul General), no power to act for the main- enance of order or for the control or administration of persons or property, all of ^j 1 m T ^ le i in ^^ s orders must be exercised under the provisions of la or er. the Consul, Shiraz has ever signed any document or taken any action witnm the powers conferred by this order, such document or such action mig a any time be called in question by the parties affected” except as so far r&gt; S e some^ regulation, of which I am unaware, covering in general acts th^order in Councff 1 ^ °® c ^ s &amp; 00c ^ He is not covered in any way by si on ^ understand al so that there is some doubt as to the terms of his Commis- “ W r K ! ^ believe applies only to the town of Shiraz and its He is nntnrl • °i S V lr - s an , ddoes ^t an 7 wa y cover the district known as Pars. and simple m 6 0rei ^ n ^ d ce Tast as the Consul for Shiraz which is a town pure of ner^es^v^fo-° n ^ U I °t^iraz has no judicial powers conferred on him he bas y e erred to His Majesty’s Consul General all Judicial matters eventown one of his assistants that same would be necessary for any matter of a probate or admfnistrative nature. matters ^c^^bu^ln^a^matters^affecti^^he^contaxil^of'Brityfgub* °t^ 'll Consul General and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. hCeS Wl10 18 A 17 - In ^ ddltlon Vice Consul at Muhammerah ( and with the few ships at ^ onsul at Ahwa 2 ) exercises all powers with reference to &lt;c British shins with their boats and the persons and property on board thereof or belong thereto under the terms of this order and under my control. 8 g 18. Thus the subordination of the Consuls at Ahwaz, Muhammerah, Shiraz and er ^ la J 1 Consul General and Resident in the Persian Gulf is not only one oi code but attects practically every action of their official lives. 19. Now the Consul General and Resident control under the Order in Council the whole of the area within its limits in so for as His Majesty’s jurisdiction is exercisable {vide article 5 and 6) under Part II article 7 all exactments of the Governor General m Council or the Governor of Bombay in Council are extended to the same area and any future enactments can be extended to it by the Secretary of State and the Governor General in Council. J The Consul General is substituted for the Governor of a Colony for the pur poses of the Foreign jurisdiction Act (article 8) and under article 55 he has power to make and alter King’s Regulations. {a) For the peace order and good government of British Subjects. (6) for securing the observance of any treaty or arrangement for the time being in force relating to any place within the limits of this order or of any native or local law or custom whether relating to trade com merce revenue or any other matter. All this within the areas of Ahwaz, Muhammerah, Shiraz and Kerman. 20. The above being the circumstances it has presumably been necessary in the past that it should be so. The question then arises does this necessity continue and is it necessary that the Resident and Consul General should continue to hold the power which he possesses or would it be more convenient for administration and for policy that this power should be curtailed. 21. It is obvious that the Resident’s position has grown out of the necessity for regarding the Persian Gulf question as a single whole and that while the Resi dent should administer and advise in all questions connected with the Persian Gulf he should in all questions connected with Persia be entirely subordinate to the Minister at Tehran. 22. This appears to me to be the necessity for to-day as it has been in the past and the most logical way of dealing with a question which must to a certain extent present difficulties of administration. 23. It would be impossible to make the Minister also Resident in the Persian Gulf—the distances are too great and he could not be spared to tour the Persian Gulf and to attend to the matters of policy and administration of the Arabian Coast. But it is essentail that Gulf politics should be viewed as a whole • f°f instance take the recent desire of the Persian Local Governor that the ntisn Navy should inform him of their arrival in a Persian Port of the last port of departure, and of the intended port of arrival. The minister requires an adviser on his coast who will inform regarding ques tions as they affect the Gulf as a whole. Thus has the present situation grown into being. 24. As regards Ahwaz the experiment of a Levant Consular Officer has been tried and for nearly 3 years and we can examine the result. The biggest opponents of this system are the Levant Consular Officers who have undertaken to work it. They will tell you frankly it is impossible. y MC446FD, i fUp rtponlp with whom they deal, they do not know fcftIK “ 5 *“”*&gt;' CCt b- »V. l„ „ called upon to administer. , ^ . 25 If they have to conduct a trial, and with 1 000 Bnt.sh Subjects and 3 000 Indians they must frequently do so or arbitrate, they are obliged to call m then Indian Political Vice Consul to assist them. 26 In a recent murder case Captain Ryan the Vice Consul not only acted as nolice in investigating the case he was also public prosecutor and while public prosecutor addressed the judge as to procedure and as to law. I am of opinion that an appeal stating the above facts would have succeeded and the case would have been sent back for retrial or have been quashed in toto. 27. It is obvious that if you are going to have a code you must have officers trained in it to administer it. Now it has been admitted on all sides that the Indian code is essential for Abadan and the Oil Fields and indeed with the rupture of our relations with Russia with the anticipated Bolshevik propaganda among the Indian Staff I consider that the use of this code and its extended powers become doubly necessary while if the present denunciation of the Treaties is to come into force and affect the jurisdiction of our Consular Officers then indeed it becomes doubly necessary to have a Consul who knows the language and the customs of the people with whom primarily he has to deal. 28. But what have we gained by putting in a Levant Consular Officer to prmnfoT-Uolanpp flip loss in administrative power of an officer untrained in his work and the language. I have searched the files in vain. I can find nothing beyond that it provides an extra appointment for the Levant service to encourage them and that it is hoped that some economy has been arrived at. 29. I question the necessity of the truth of the latter statement. Captain Ryan who was at Ahwaz and officiated for Mr. Moneypenny was nearly the same age as the latter officer and certainly drew no more pay. I am of the opinion that by reorganising the services of Khuzistan and Shiraz the same work can be done at a reduced cost. 30. Politically I can see no difference between having an Indian Political Officer and a Levant Consular Officer and indeed Sir Percy Loraine in his No. 632, dated October 19th, 1922 referring to the fact that Consuls in Persia were drawn for two departments states “ it would be totally unfair to say that the working of the pre sent system indicates any compelling necessity for such unification. 31. Both officers are equally subordinate to His Majesty’s Minister and I would here state that a Resident who does not see the absolute necessity for his own complete subordination to the Minister at Tehran in all Persian matters has not the political sense and is not fit for his important post. 32. That there has been a question on this subject it would be idle to deny, that the apparently conflicting interests of England and India have sometimes produced enquiry our files show. It is a curious and interesting fact that a committee of the House of Commons examining the question in 1870 went so far as to say that the Legation ought to be, like the present one in Kabul an Indian Legation or failing that it should be staffed from India. This has never been since suggested by any one and I only quote it to show that the interests of India were so great that a Committee of the House of Commons could put this opinion on record. 33. These interests are as great to-day as they were in the past but we have now the added Imperial interest of the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the fact tha the Persian Gulf lies athwart the strategic air line to India and to the further east. 34. In these circumstances I would respectfully state my opinion as to the course we should administratively follow. Haying marked, as I have done, the subordination of the Political Resident to the Minister, in all Persian affairs, it appears to me in no way to benefit our policy or its carrying out to change the limits of the Order in Council and to attempt oreduce the status or power of the Political Resident and Consul General in the Persian Gulf. He works largely by prestige and his power on the Arab Coast is certainly affected by any reduction of his powers or position on the Persian Coast. 35. I would then leave in his hands as in the past all the maritime provinces and the officers acting in them and reappoint an Indian Political Officer to Ahwaz. All these officers are in their Consular capacities totally and completely subordinate to the Minister for all Political purposes, as is the Consul General. Leave them under the latter for all administrative purposes, for he can visit them and inspect their work, when necessary, and the resultant unity of purpose certainly strengthens our policy in the Persian Gulf which is, when all is said and done,the ultimate source of our strength and of our weakness in our Eastern policy, except in so far as the Af ghanistan Frontier is concerned. 36. By acknowdedging the position of the Resident in the Gulf, by underlining his subordination to the Minister in Persian Affairs, we rid the question of its diffi culties and provide the maximum driving power to do the work which lies before us. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to H. B. M.’s Minister, Tehran. J&amp;rO) Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 251-S., dated Bushire, the 6th August 1927. I have the honour to state that in my accompanying letter No. 248-S., dated the 31st July 1927 (S. No.4), I have dealt with the question of the jurisdiction of this Consulate-General in Persia. 2. In paragraph 29 I have hinted that with the reorganisation of the consular appointments economies could be effected, while I have argued for the rendition of the Ahwaz appointment to the Indian Political Department on the ground that Levant Consular Officers are untrained to function under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, have no knowledge of the customs of the people with whom primarily they have to deal, and are unacquainted with their language. Should the denunciation of the treaties take effect their disadvantages will be ;still greater since they will be unable to understand the complaints of the Indian employees of the Anglo Persian Oil Company and British firms whose num bers reach some 3,000 to 4,000. 3. The question of the jurisdiction of this Consulate-General has now been raised by the Foreign Office, London, and at the same time in his No. 45, dated May 14th, 1927, paragraph 6, the Consul at Shiraz has suggested his own abolishment pointing out that the appointment was made for a definite purpose, that that pur pose no longer exists and that the Consul at Shiraz has few British Subjects to pro tect. 4. The moment then seems a proper one to put forward certain suggestions for a reorganisation which I consider are very cogent and which while affording econo mies would strengthen our reorganisation. 5. Somewhere about 1863 Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf pointed out the unsuitability of Bushire as a headquarters or re Political Residency. After 64 years I would re-iterate the statement or that grea Resident and stress that unsuitability which to-day is magnified by the cl eve op- ment of other interests in the Persian Gulf which make it possible to n , w a formerly did not exist, some other place to which to move. The 0 y eaas has shifted the centre of politics from the South of the Gulf, which ley avoure , to the North. 6. Bushire was once a port, but with the greater tonnage of vessels it is now ■ roadstead in which the mail steamers lie either at four or seven miles distance Irom he harbour, according to their draft; the weather in the Persian Gu is peisis en } &gt;ad and the journey which may take one hour when it is safe for as earn aunc &gt;e used takes anything from six to twelve hours when the journey as o akenin a larger sailing vessel. My son in February last left e us . ° i P.M., was out all night and arrived on the mail steamer at 8 a.m. the following day. hips frequently are unable to deliver all their cargo and are o ige o ov y heir cargo*7 Bushire is a failing place and will in a few years be the port for Shiraz only and little more than a village. Only to-day the Governor of the Gulf Ports told me that in Perisan Official eyes the Bushire Governorship was steadily losing its im portance. With the development of the Railway Muhammerah with Khor Musa will be the centre of the traffic. 8. At Bushire there are no Persians and there are no Arabs, there are no politics and an officer learns as little m his daily life about either Persia or Arabia as he would jf P 0 wore m Karachi. X, who personally have been accustomed to constant con tact with Persians, find that living at Sabzabad seven miles from Bushire, I do not see an Arab or a Persian once in a month and I ceased to be surprised that Bushire Officials have been unable to speak the language. Even with the officers who live in Bushire itself the situation is much the same. Persian and Bushiries themselves are a different race and the few Persian Officials in the place mix very little with any one else. 9. The place is then an island cut off from all knowledge of Persia and its poli tics and is useless to me for any knowledge of Arabs or Arab matters. Its sole ad vantage is that it is fairly central for visiting the other places in the Persian Gulf, an advantage which is in actual fact when examined so slight as hardly to count, since the ships lie at such a distance from the harbour. 10. But not the least of the disadvantages of the place is its unhealthiness. The first complaint I received on taking over this appointment was the difficulty of obtaining sanitary houses for the clerks and the fact that all of them suffered very badly from fever in consequence, a fact borne out by this hot weather when my office has been depleted by sickness. 11. It has been our experience of 100 years in the Gulf that, until we pro vide our own house accommodation, men sicken. Our experience with Consuls at Muscat and Bandar Abbas is that Europeans not only sicken but die in these cir cumstances. Thus if we remain at Bushire it will be necessary to supply house accommoda tion for the clerical establishment. 12. But I consider that our organisation would not only be better but more economical if we removed from Bushire. With the building of the railway the centre of gravity of the Gulf will move to the Muhammerah area which is already in the centre of activity of the Anglo Persian Oil Company. Our interests in Bushire are small—-m fact I am unable to suggest any interest existing—and the weight of a Consul-General is wasted in the Muhammerah-Ahwaz area our interests are great or wi 1 day by day become greater. At present the Consul is completely over shadowed politically by the wealthier members of the Anglo Persian Oil Com- j • ^ or P^sian eye, for the Governor General who is now established m Ahwaz, for the Persian Official in general, is bad. We need a onsu enera o compete with the situation and we need an establishment such as t£e Kesident necessarily maintains for his position on the Arab coast to maintain e r ^ s P^ 1 or e Government which is in the East so important a matter an establishment which exists but counts for nothing at Bushire. rharqpfo^ Ut u°T r n ^ u ^ amm erah and the Oil Fields is mainly Indian in man win lf nd 1 1 6 a ™niadverted on the anomaly of specially sending a a nL - G n ° k “ &lt; ’ wled f e ° f the Mian language and Indian Laws and customs to same time w T 18 re 1 uired in most °f the work he does, when at the nested speclall y trained men available for the task—the work con- Politienl rtono t nropean employees can also be better done by an officer of the Political Department, since they come under the convenient Indian code.

The Muhammerah Vice-Consulate is one that must essentially be held by an officer from India. Apart from the large amount of semi-judicial arbitration work m which he is engaged the greater part of his work is connected with Indians. Last year he issued for the Government of India the following passports certificates of identity for British Indian passage passes (used for employees of the Anglo Persian Oil Company) and visas— Certificates of Identity and passage passes .. .. 1 , 7$5 Visas .. .. 585 Permits for permission to come to Persia .. .. 180 New passports to British Indian Subjects .. .. 57 Renewal of Government of Indian passports .. 263 He also issued for Iraq the following :— Certificates of Identity for Iraq and British Indian Subjects .. .. .. .. .. 427 Visas .. .. .. .. .. 1,946 During the same time he renewed 308 Foreign Office passports. To do his work a knowledge of Hindustani and of the Indian races and customs is essential. 17. I would then recommend that the Political Resident and the Consul General with all his staff should move from Busire to Muhammerah. In these circumstances with the nearness of Ahwaz to Muhammerah it would be possible to do all the work now requiring two officers at Ahwaz, with one officer with the addition of one European confidential clerk to the Resident’s staff to enable the Secretary or Under-Secretary to proceed to Ahwaz when necessary. 18. The administrative advantages of Muhammerah for the Resident are manifold. The first is that it will in time be on the railway and thus whether we decided to move now or not we should eventually have to do so. Secondly its position obviates all the difficulties of a bad port. Ships lie within a few hundred yards of what would be the Residency and we have none of the difficulties of reaching a ship or landing at the port on arrival a matter which more than compensates for the small disadvantage of the extra hours steaming to reach the Gulf ports. Thirdly my work brings me into contact with the Iraq Officials and the Air Force and is likely to do so more and more as the Air line develops. At Muham merah contact is easy. We are only 19 miles from Basrah at Bushire it is dimcu t. Fourthly Muhammarah is healthy and has accommodation available built by the Anglo Persian Oil Company. Fifthly one of the most important advantages in my mind, the Consul General and staff are near to and in communication with both Persia and Peisian cla and the Arab side of the world. They meet both Persian and Arab problems and are in touch,19 The Ando Persian Oil Company are giving up their mam offices as they are moving the whole of their clerical staff to Abadan. These offices cost £30,000 to build and belong to the Shaikh of Muhammerah. m,S.....«»«.'\ Cii'-i”.' glad to rfl in hi. pceaent in,pontion, t2.0» ..aid ' be required for reconverting to a Residency. Mr. Jacks informed me that the Persian Military authorities had their eye on these offices. The buildings are large and would accommodate the Resident and one wing downstairs could be made into the offices without in any way interfering with the privacy of the Resident. Buildings near by can be acquired from the Company at a reasonable rate for the accommodation of the staff and servants and our present Consulate could be kept on for the Secretary to the Resident while accommo dation could be hired or built for the Under-Secretary. 20 Khor Musa may possibly become the terminus of the railway but Muham merah and Abadan will always be our centre of interest and a branch line must certainly be built to Muhammerah. The price of land will rise and I consider that now is the time to take advan tage of the opportunity which exists. If we wait we shall have to pay double if not treble the price. 21. My suggestions then are:— Move the headquarters of the Resident \to Muhammerah with summer quarters at Shiraz. Post a Vice-Consul for Bushire and Shiraz leaving the present Pro-Consul at Shiraz and posting a similar Indian Official to Bushire. Reduce one British Officer at Ahwaz. Add one confidential clerk to the Resident’s staff. The consequent reduction would be one Consul and two Vice-Consuls. The increase one Indian Pro-Consul at Bushire and one confidential clerk in the Resident’s office. I have no hesitation in saying that with this reduction our efficiency and power will be greatly increased. It will benefit our work in Persia but will especially greatly strengthen our position in the Persian Gulf.

Department. ,Q. 5000 The question of reducing the Residency- in the Persian Gulf from first to second class has arisen in the course of consideration of the larger question of re-adjusting the incidence of Diplomatic ajid. uonsu.l&amp;r sxpGnditurs in Pspsici 't'-G extracts from earlier telegroms put below the Government of India’s telegram of 20th September. j So far as the information available here shows ; the reduction of the Residency to second class (from which it was elevated in February 1915 - see P.4063/14 and P.516/15) would only have led in any case to a saving in respect of the emoluments of the Resident himself, not to any saving in respect of establishment. If the reduction had been to the same footing as the ordinary run of second class Residencies, the saving would have amounted to roughly a total of Rs.11290 per annum (viz. the difference between the salary, Rs.4000 per mensem, of a 1st class Resident and that, Rs.3000 per mense m + £13. 6. 8. S.O.P, per mense m,of a 2nd class Resident, and the average annual cost of the ; enhanced allowances of a. 1st class Resident as I shov/n in enclosure 2 of the Government of India’s Finance Despatch of 24th September 1914 - assuming that these allowances are much the same now as then). This saving would not have been big enough to have any effect on the re-adjustment of Diplomatic and consular expenditure; but the Government of India propose to reduce it by more 1058 3/2(5 than2 than half, hy attaching to the post, on the resumed 2nd class 'basis, special ps.y at Es.oGOC pei ffinum. (I assume that the other concession of a rent-free house is no more than eo.uivalent to S.G.P. of £13.6.8 per mensem; hut in actual fact it seems likely to he worth more.) The saving that should resiilt from reduction will, if the Government of India’s proposals are approved, amount to no more than Rs.53TOO per annum - not a very large sum. The Government of India’s motive in proposing to make the post more attractive financial!, than the ordinary 2nd class Residency is to ensure that it continues to he filled hy a competent officer. But hy reducing it to second class basis they will remove what is prohahly one of the greatest attractions, the possibility of earning in the Persian Gulf Residency an additional pension of £200 a year for which military politicals may qualify. For over 60 years the Residency in the Persian Gulf has, except for two acting appointments, been held hy military politicals; and if it is the Government of India’s object to attempt to keep the post attractive to the best of these, one y •7; # £tc would have thought it desirable to keep the post as first-class, i.e. as one in which a military officer Can render ’’approved service for three years in a civil post carrying a salary of Rs.4000 or more” and so earn an additional pension of £200 a year; if the post is to carry a salary of between Rs.3000 and 4000 only additional pension which can be earned is only £100 pei annum. But perhaps the cornu et it ion at » * the top of the Political Deportment, for the tenure of^ 7 , Minute Paper. Bepartment. !S. any Residency is so great that this argument for retaining the Bushire Residency on a first-class basis is not very strong. There is no doubt that the change of conditions in the Persian Gulf since the War has been so great that the retention of a first- dass Residency^can no longer be justified with iovernment^of refer ence to all. the arguments which led'io its ''september'lQll elevation in 1915 - During the War and in the fi* llled^marginal y6arS precedillg dt the Persian Gulf was an area of very great Imperial and international importance, such as it is not likely to attain again. But the Residency still has qualities which differentiate it widely from Residencies, vhether first or second class, in India, and which the Government of India clearly consider to be such as to make the incumbents’duties more exacting than those of any Resident Class II elsewhere. The question therefore seems to _ CtA\ Iniu tL /V 's 'r j So* ** kru^k (' resolve itself into this:- whetherTit is worth‘ ^ /i I nb -t/sPu- (i*)— while, for the small annual saving involved ,to l ^ create the precedent of making a sort of intermediate Residency between 1st and 2nd class, whether it would not be better to maintain a clear-cut division between the two classes by leaving the Persian Gulf Residency in tiie higher class? If the latter course were adopted, the device of creating a supernumerary Residency Class I for four months,to enable Colonel Prideaux to preserve his legitimate claim to the higher additional pension or of taking action loss 5000 3/20 underunder §96 b/s) of the Act, would not he required. But if it he decided to approve the reduction of the Residency to second class as from Ibth December next,, one of these devices seems to he necessary, on grounds of equity; - the alternative ox postponing the reduction of the post till 15th April would he very awkward./^Th e proposal to create cemporarily a supernumerary Residency Class I in order to get round a personal difficulty is not altogether withou x precedent. It was adopted in 1911 in the case of Mr Stuart Fraser who was appointed Resident Class I while holding the Kashmir Residency - a Class II Residency. The circumstances were not the same nor even very similar, though there happens to he a reference to the case at the heginning of the despatch of 24th September 1914: and the circumstances in which the Government of India propose now to adopt this course are most unlikely t(j) recur. Fear of creating an awkward precedent need not therefore constitute an argument against approval, of the Government of India's proposal, if it is thought otherwise sound.^ Whether action such/as the Government of India propose, alternatively, under § 96 B(5) of the Government of India Act would he preferable, this Department is not in a position to sa y*&gt; prim a facie this course would he open to the objection that, as it would apparently necessitate a decision framed in general terms, it would he more capable of constituting a precedent which it would he better to avoid. (For example Lieut.Colonel S.G. Knox who retired in 1924 after officiating in the Persian Gulf Residency might possibly have cited itTwo questions are raised viz; (1) the futu e status of the Residency and (2) the treatment to be accorded to Col »Pr ideaox. (1) This Department, having regard to the small financial issues involved, has no strong views. As it appears from the Government of India’s telegram that the nature of the duties is more arduous, the responsibilities' more exceptional and the consequences of blunder graver than those of a Class II Residency, and in view o^ the “political reasons of weight” there be would certainly seem to/a case for retaining the Class I status of the Residency. (As regards the Government of India’s proposal, h the grant of rent free quarters is open to objection, so long as fundamental Rule 45 retains its present form But if the Residency is continued as Class I, the point need not be raised) . (2) The proposed concession to Col.priieaux is twofold; (a) His service is to be extended beyond the age o^ 55 for 3 weeks and (b) he is to be granted leave for 4 months beyond the date on which he would otherwise be compulsorily retired. i * / th (a) and (b) are within the powers of the Jtc. kVlt lb Governor General in Council, the former under Pun dame ntal Rule 56(c) (vii) (4) and the latter under Fundamental Rule 86. But unless Col.Prideaux has applied for leave in sufficient time before the date of compulsory retirement and leave has been refused owing to the exigencies of the service, concession (b) would not be consistent with uhe interpretation of Fundamental Rule 36 contained in the Government of India’s Circular letter No.2031 C.S.R. dated 26th November, 1923. It is true that under the Civil Service Regulations (Article 234) Col.Prideaux would have been eligible for the 4 months leave without the above condition, but t(mS 0f the Clrcular letter are quite explicit and fr‘&gt;fMinute Paper. Department. A ^ ik Li ^1 Ih Fr ^ jis ^ h'W ; JVw 5 ; I think that in the reply the point should he referred to; it would perhaps suffice to say that the Secretary of State assumes that the conditions laid do m in the Circular letter have 'been fulfilled. The correct course, if the cond itions have not been fulfilled and if, as is presumably the case, the Government of India are satisfied that the special reasons referred to Rule in Fundamenta 1/56(0) ^ii) ( 4 ) are present, would, seem to be for Col.Prideaux to be continued (under Fundamental Rule 56) on duty in the post until 15th April, 1927. The matter is entirely one for the Government of India under Fundamental Rule 86 and it might be held that this Office has no locus st an di for interfering, but the Secretary of State cannot divest himself of responsibility « the administration of the rules made by him in regard to officers^ control over whom is retained by him,and I think the point ought to be raised. If it be decided,in accordance with the Government of India's suggestion, to reduce the status of the Residency to Glass II, I venture to think, despite the views expressed by you and by the S.&amp; G .'Department, that it waul 1 oe preferable to give the concession to Col.Prideaux under the powers conferred by Section 963 ( 5) rather than by the ad hoc creation of a supernumerary post of seem to be entirely within the scope o^ the section. f ', f■ 1 - % There would he no need, as you suggest to frame a decision in general terms: all that would he needed is a statement in the reply to the Government o^ India that the Secretary of State in Council sanctions as a special case the counting of the 4 months leave as service qualifying for special additional pension at the higher rate. The alternative of creating a supernume _ary post seems to me an unnecessarily cumbersome method of attaining the same object and to he more likely to attract attention and therefore to form an awkward precedent.Of I \ 10!l Minute Paper. Department. To take LIr.Turner's last point first, I agree that the ad hoc creation of a supernumerary 1st Class Residency for four months in place of the one reduced is likely to attract attention. But it is not likely that the grant to Colonel Prideaux of the (D concessions of extending his active service to lust four months short of the qualifying period . |I J Q for higher pension and then allowing nini/to count four months leave as service for pension as if he held a lien on the 1st class Residency which he held •before proceeding on leave, would be hidden from his fellow officers; and it seems much more likely that other officers who have nearly, but not quite, qualified by service for the higher pension would prav for the extension to them of the concessions So granted to him, than that anyone will be in a position to request the^creation in his favour of a supernumerary Residency in place of Jj would have been able to claim a lion tf 1 “ nuu- to exist. Of the two alternative courses the creation of a supernumerary post seems less likely in fact to be quotable as a preceuent than action under section 963fe| of the Act, and therefore preferable. But this is a subsidiary point which will not arise if the proposal to reduce the status of the 1 Residency is not thought worth while.

It may, in individual cases, dispense with the production of a certificate, and may by general order exempt any specified class of Government servants from the operation of this rule. 11 . Unless in any case it be otherwise distinctly provided the whole time of a Government servant is at the disposal of the Government which pays him, and he may be employed in anv manner required by proper authority, without claim for additional remuneration, whether the services required of him are such as would ordinarily be remunerated from general revenues, from a local fund, or from the revenues of an Indian State. 12 . (a) Two or more Government servants cannot be appointed substantively to the same permanent post at the same time. ( 6 ) A Government servant cannot be appointed substantively, except as a temporary measure, to two or more permanent posts at the same time. (c) A Government servant cannot be appointed substantively to a post on which another Government servant holds a lien. 13. If a Government servant is transferred to duty which there is reason to believe will not terminate within three years, and retains no connection with his substantive post, a local Govern ment may suspend his lien upon that post and fill it substantively, subject to the condition that the arrangements thus made will be reversed on the return of the Government servant in question. When the Government servant transferred draws pay in a selec tion grade of a cadre, another Government servant may, subject to the same reservation, be promoted to the selection grade, even if no change of duties is involved. 14. Unless his lien is formally transferred or suspended by the local Government, a Government .servant holding substantively a permanent post retains a lien on that post or on a post of the same character in the same cadre :— (a) subject to the exception in Hide 97, while on leave; (b) while on foreign service or holding a temporary post or officiating in another post; (c) during joining-time on transfer to another post, unless he is transferred substantively to a post on lower pay, in which case his lien is transferred to the new post from the date on which he is relieved of his duties in the old post; and (d) while under suspension. Note.—In the case of a chaplain, the acceptance during leave of a benefice in the United Kingdom is not acceptance of foreign service for the purpose of sub-clause (b) above. 15. A Government servant shall not, save in cases of inefficiency or misbehaviour, be transferred substantively to a post carrying less pay than his relative position in the cadre of the service to which he belongs would justify. 17301 A 3I 8 16. A Government servant may be required to subscribe to a provident fund, a family pension fund or other similar fund in accordance with such rules as the Secretary 7 of State in Council may by order prescribe. 17. Subject to any exceptions specifically made in these rules, an officer shall begin to draw the pay and allowances attached to his tenure of a post with effect fiom the date when he assumes the duties of that post, and shall cease to draw them as soon as he ceases to discharge those duties. 18. After five years’ continuous absence from duty, elsewhere than on foreign service in India, whether with or without leave, a Government servant ceases to be in Government employ. Note. The Governor-General in Council is authorised to relax this rule in the case of Government servants lent to the Govern- m on f c nt Si mu and Iran.

Subject to the provisions of rules made under section 45 a of the Act and to any restrictions which the Secretary of State in .Council may by order impose upon the powers of the Governor- General in Council, or the Governor in Council, as the case may be, the fixation of pay is within the competence of a local Govern ment ; provided that, except in the case of personal pay granted in the circumstances defined in Rule 9 (23) (a) the pay of a Government servant shall not be so increased as to exceed the pay sanctioned for his post without the sanction of an authority com petent to create a post in the same cadre on a rate of pay equal to his pay when increased.

They do not, however, apply to any time-scale sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council in so far as they are inconsistent with terms specially so sanctioned for such time-scale. 22. When a Government servant is appointed substantively to a post on a time-scale of pay :— (a) (i) if he has not previously officiated in the post, or (ii) if he has officiated in it but his present substantive pay exceeds the pay which he last drew 7 in it, he will draw as initial pay the pay of the stage in the time-scale next above his present substantive pay, if any, and will draw increments after the periods usually required ; and (b) if he has previously officiated in the post, but his present substantive pay does not exceed the pay which he drew* when last officiating, A I he will draw initial pay equal to that pay, and will count for incre ment in that stage the period during which he w T as drawing the said pay. ;flere an efficiei |g Deit above tl Mont the spe' Miflcrements. befollowiiig pn '•■tsforincre: ♦111 duty in a \ . forincremen ^iciatHgserv post, and le: 7 forincremen Een, or won pended nnde llaGovernme biding a te appointed to tigher temp service in tl to tie lower &gt; scale applica IbGovernme interrupted i titan extraoi fety, leave, i® tie time. the Governi post, : itft ign serviu flicable tc t the pe Go 1 or sue° f Wh ‘ ch IS ^ 8 ^. *aU be treated as^^if he \teie transferred to a new post on the new pay ■ provided that he may at his option retain Ins old pay until the date on which he has earned his next or any subsequent inert ment on the old scale, or until he vacates his post or ceases to draw pay on that time-scale.

An increment may be withheld itl&gt; from a Government servant by a local Government or bv anv authority to whom the local Government may delegate this mwer under Rule 6, if his conduct has not been good or his work h is not been satisfactory. In ordering the withholding of an inerp Dt? Wto| ment, the witholdmg authority shall state the period for which it is withheld, and whether the postponement shall have the effect of postponing future increments. 25. Where an efficiency bar is prescribed in a time-scale the increment next above the bar shall not be given to a Government ii**,; servant without the specific sanction of the authority empowered the Sec® to withhold increments. 1 26. The following provisions prescribe the conditions on which MciUs v service counts for increments in a time-scale (a) All duty in a post to which a time-scale applies counts for increments in that time-scale. (b) Officiating service in another post, service in a temporary post, and leave other than extraordinary leave count for increments in the time-scale applicable to the post on which the Government servant concerned holds a lien, or would hold a lien had his lien not been sus pended under Rule 13. (c) If a Government servant, while officiating in a post or holding a temporary post on a time-scale of pay, is appointed to officiate in a higher post or to hold a higher temporary post, his officiating or temporary service in the higher post shall, if he is re-appointed to the lower post, count for increments in the time- scale applicable to such lower post. (d) If a Government servant’s tenure of a temporary post is interrupted by duty in another post or by leave, other than extraordinary leave, or by foreign service, such duty, leave, or foreign service counts for increments in the time-scale applicable to the temporary post if the Government servant returns to the temporary post. (e) Foreign service counts for increments in the time-scale applicable to :— (i) the post in Government service on which the Government servant concerned holds a lien, or would hold a lien had his lien not been suspended under Rule 13 ; and 17301 ncta, anil' Thev ionite ! e Secfftamk with terns sb site his pres® s-' -!

If, however, the presumptive pay of the post, whether permanent or temporary, which lie holds substantively is greaterMsu, 11! fe 'Bin i than the presumptive pay of the new post, he will draw pay equal to the presumptive pay of his substantive post. J 4 Note.—If the post in which a Government servant officiates is tenable by a Government servant of any one of several grades or classes m a cadre and the fixation of the pay of all such grades or classes is within the competence of the local ^ Government, the local Government may permit the officiatino- m&lt;G| Government servant to draw the pay of any one of such grades or Nssffite classes,: 32. A Government servant officiating in a post on a time-scale draws as initial pay the stage ol the time-scale next above his substantive pay, if any; provided that if he has previously officiated in the post oi in a post in the same cadre' on the same time-scale, his initial pay shall not be less than the pay which he drew when last officiating. All officiating service in any stage of the time-scale, whether continuous or not, counts for increment in that stage. If the presumptive pay of the Government servant’s substantive post at any time exceeds the pay calculated under this rule, he will draw pay equal to that presumptive pay. Note. —In cases where the fixation of the time-scale of pay is within the competence of the local Government, the local Govern ment may permit the officiating Government servant to draw as initial pay any stage of the time-scale. 33. When a Government servant officiates in a post the pay of which has been fixed at a rate personal to another Government servant, a local Government may permit him to draw pay at any rate not exceeding the rate so fixed, or, if the rate so fixed be a time-scale, not exceeding the lowest stage of that time-scale. imenf smsfi i id toe® tie is m fro specify ii onciai iter resp®*- 1 orfis®^ vo posts eencreatA atelyAeA rest”' iW 34.

Pay of Official Members of the Indian Legislature.—A Government servant nominated as a member of the Legislative Assembly or the Council of State shall receive, while serving on the Assembly or the Council, ffire pay which he would from time to time have drawn had he not been so serving. He shall receive, in addition, such travelling allowance as the Governor-General in Council may fix. 17301 A 5f 12 39. Pay of Temporary Posts—When a temporary post is created which may have to be filled by a person not already in Government service, the pay of the post shall be fixed with reference, to the minimum that is necessary to secure the services of a person capable of discharging efficiently the duties of the post. 40. When a temporary post is created which will probably be filled by a person who is already a Government servant, its pay should be fixed by the local Government with due regard to— (а) the character and responsibility of the work to be per formed, and ( б ) the existing pay of Government servants of a status sufficient to warrant their selection for the post. 41. A person appointed to a temporary post will draw the pay of that post. 42. Subsistence Grants. —A local Government may make a subsistence grant to a Government servant in the following circumstances:— (a) To any Government servant other than a military officer, while under suspension. (b) To any Government servant appointed in the United Kingdom, up to a maximum of two months, if, on first arrival in India, he is prevented by illness from proceeding to the seat of the Government to which he is attached, or to any other station to which he is ordered to proceed direct. 43. The amount of subsistence grant shall be regulated as follows :— (a) In the case of— (i) a member of the Indian Civil Service, a statutory civil servant or a military commissioned officer subject to the civil leave rules; or (ii) any other Government servant receiving sub sistence grant under Rule 42 (b), it shall be such as the Secretary of State in Council may by general order prescribe (b) In the case of any Government servant under suspension. other than a member of the Indian Civil Sendee or a military commissioned officer subject to the civil leave rules, it shall be such as the suspending authority may direct, but shall in no case exceed one-fourth of the pay of the suspended Government servant.

Emoluments, for the purpose of this rule, include compensatory allowance other than travelling allowance, whether drawn from general revenues or from a local fund, and pension, if the occupant is in receipt of pension. Note. —The standard rent shall be calculated as follows :— (i) In the case of leased residences, it shall be the sum paid to the lessor, plus such allowance for maintenance and repairs, if these are a charge on the local Government, as the latter may fix. (ii) In the case of residences acquired or constructed by Government, it shall be calculated on the cost of acquiring or constructing the resi dence, including any capital expenditure incurred after acquisition, or construction, together with rfie cost or assessed value of the site, and shall be a percentage of its cost equal to such rate of interest as may from time to time be fixed by the Secretary of State in Council, plus such allowance for maintenance and repairs as the local Government may fix.

Chapter X.— Leave. Section I .—Extent of Application. 58. Unless in any case it be otherwise distinctly provided in section VI. of this chapter, the rules in sections I. to V. of this chapter apply to all Government servants to whom the funda mental rules as a whole apply; provided that it shall be open to any person who is in Government service at the time when the fundamental rules come into force to exercise the option of remaining under the leave rules to which he has hitherto been subject. The intention of exercising this option must be specifically declared to the local Government or the Governor- General in Council, as the case may be, within six months of the date on which the fundamental rules come into force, or, if the Government servant be on leave on that date, within six months of his return from leave. Every Government servant who does not make such a declaration will become subject to the rules in sections I. to A 7 , of this chapter. The option once exercised is final. Note. —A similar option may be exercised by the Government servants mentioned in rules 97 and 98. T20 59. Leave is earned under Sections I. to V. of this chapter by a Government servant holding substantively a permanent post in civil employ, or holding a lien on such a post. 60. Leave is earned by duty only. For the purpose of this rule a period spent in foreign seivice counts as duty if contribution towards leave salary is paid on account of such period. 61. A military commissioned officer appointed to a post in civil employ becomes subject to these rules under the following ^ conditions :— ( a )_(i) An officer subject, before such appointment, to the Indian Army Leave Rules becomes subject to these rules from the date of first substantive appointment to a post in civil employ or from the date of completion of three years’ continuous officiating duty in such service, whichever is earlier. In reckoning con tinuous duty— ( 1 ) Any period of foreign service, to which transfer was made direct from a civil post, may be included, and (2) Leave does not operate to break continuity unless the officer has to revert to military employ in order to obtain such leave. N ote rppig ru l e also applies to commissioned officers transferred from the Army Veterinary Department to the Civil Veterinary Department. (ii) A continuous service officer of the Royal Engineers becomes subject to these rules from the date of his entry into permanent civil employ or from the date of his election for continuous Indian service, whichever is later. . (iii) A non-continuous service officer of the Royal Engineers, if he elects for these rules, becomes subject to them from the date of his entry into permanent civil employ or from the date of completion of five years’ Indian service, whichever is later. ... * Transfer from military service to a post in civil employ, the tenure of which is limited to a definite period, does not entitle an officer to leave under these rules. 62. Except as provided in Rule 61, a military officer in civil employ remains subject to military leave rules. ftSt When a militarv commissioned officer subject to these lien on his post in civil employ, the period of his absence counts 64. Unless in any case it be otherwise expressly provided by or under these rules, a Government servant transferred to a service or post to which these rules apply from a service or post to which they do not apply is not ordinarily entitled to leave under these rules in respect of duty performed before such transfer; 1 ^ Lgrt,* 8 : I siidi d tiC j!ioD df] Ljiw Lived after LfliW tf 16 Ufflinent hj Gown® 1 j,| c servirt Ly io count b 5ipiin? be* fti local L k ffhflm le jaliicoervie [ feriptioc p is real iaratretun lid iiiooniigs or flMtlMY,!

(b) A Government servant who is dismissed or removed from the public service, but is reinstated on appeal or revision, is entitled to count his former service for leave, unless the appellate or reviewing authority declares that he shall not so count it in whole or in part. Section II .—General Conditions. 66 . A local Government may make rules specifying the autho rities by whom leave, other than special disability leave under Rule 83, may be granted. 67. Leave cannot be claimed as of right. When the exigencies of the public service so require, discretion to refuse or revoke leave of any description is reserved to the authority empowered to grant it. 68 . Leave ordinarily begins on the day on which transfer of charge is effected and ends on the day preceding that on which charge is resumed. When joining time is allowed to a Govern ment servant returning from leave out of India, the last day of his leave is the day before the arrival of the vessel in which he returns at her moorings or anchorage in the port of debarkation. A local Government may, however, make rules defining the circumstances in, and the conditions on, which Sundays or other recognised holidays may be prefixed to leave or affixed to leave or joining time. 69. A Government servant on leave may not take any service or accept any employment without obtaining the previous sanction of— (a) The Secretary of State, if the Government servant is residing in Europe, North Africa, America or the West Indies; and (b) The Governor-General in Council, or any lower authority empowered to appoint him, if he is residing elsewhere. Note .—This rule does not apply to casual literary work, or to service as an examiner or similar employment; nor does it apply to acceptance of foreign service, which is governed by Rule 110. 70. All orders recalling a Government servant to duty before the expiry of his leave should state whether the return to duty is optional or compulsory. If the return is optional, the Government22 servant is entitled to no concession. If it is compulsory, he is entitled^— (a) If the leave from which he is recalled is out of India— (i) To receive a free passage to India; and, pro vided that he has not completed half the period of his leave by the date of leaving for India on recall, or three months, whichever period is shorter, to receive a refund of the cost of his passage from India. (ii) To count the time spent on the voyage to India as duty for purposes of calculating leave; and (iii) To receive leave-salary during the voyage to India and for the period from the date of landing in India to the date of joining his post to be paid leave-salary at the same rate at which he would have drawn it had he not been recalled but returned in the ordinary course on the termination of his leave. (b) If the leave from which he is recalled is in India, to be treated as on duty from the date on which he starts for the station to which he is ordered, and to draw travelling allowance for (he journey, but to draw until he joins his post leave-salary only. 71. No Government servant who has been granted leave on medical certificate may return to duty without first producing a medical certificate of fitness in such form as the Governor-General in Council, in the case of a Government servant on leave in Asia, or the Secretary of State in Council, in the case of a Government servant on leave elsewhere, may by order prescribe. A local Government may require a similar certificate in the case of any Government servant who has been granted leave for reasons of health, even though such leave was not actually granted on a medical certificate. 72. Unless he is permitted to do so by the authority which granted his leave, a Government servant on leave may not return to duty more than fourteen days before the expiry of the period of leave granted to him. 73. A Government servant who remains absent after the end of his leave is entitled to no leave-salary for the period of such absence, and that period will be debited against his leave-account as though it were leave on half average pay, unless his leave is extended by the local Government. Wilful absence from duty after the expiry of leave may be treated as misbehaviour for the purpose of Rule 15. 74. — (a) Subject to any instructions which may be given by the Governor-General in Council in connection with the control of the issue of money from treasuries or by the Auditor-General m India in order to secure efficiency and uniformity of audit, a local U All Go ver Lio be subject hjjv leave k following y leave rules jiinj Goverci entitled to prior to sir appointee: oftbeconf scholarsbif or been de^ linj Govern] tbe dlth.« entitled bi tbe Civil f Any Govern] appointee July 1923 departeen or a cert admission tee rules Provide] be entitlei Provide] ment serv reason of ordinate s&lt; hnhe purp tall be deteri ^Schedule |23 it is ’e to be to ! ®1 itlont fa izmM ler piescril s absent atet for tke pay, -Government may make rules prescribing the proeedur followed in India— (i) in making application for leave and for permission return from leave, (ii) in granting leave, (iii) in the payment of leave-salary ; and (iv) in the maintenance of records of service. ti- (b) The procedure to be followed elsewhere than in India will Ike prescribed by the Governor-General in Council.

The amount of Leave due to a Government servant is the balance of leave at his credit in the leave account. 81. Leave may be granted to a Government servant at the discertion of the authority entitled to grant the leave, subject to the following restrictions : (a) The maximum amount of leave which may be granted, expressed in terms of leave on average pay, is the privilege leave which it would be permissible to grant to the Government servant in question on the date on which he becomes subject to these rules, under the rules applicable to him prior to that date :. plus one-eleventh of the period spent on duty sub sequent to that date : plus (i) In the case of Government servants under the special leave rules—three years; or (ii) In the case of Government servants under the ordinary leave rules—two and a half years.

The following provisions apply to vacation departments only (a) A local Government may make rules specifying the departments or parts of departments which should be treated as vacation departments, and the conditions in which a Government servant should be considered to have availed himself of a vacation. (b) Vacation counts as duty, but the periods of total leave in rules 77, 81 (a) and 81 ( 6 ) should ordinarily be reduced by one month for each year of duty in which the Government servant has availed himself of the vacation. If a part only of the vacation has been taken in any year, the period to be deducted will be a fraction of a month equal to the proportion which the part of the vacation taken bears to the full period of the vacation .

The period of three months may be extended by the Governor-General in Council if he is completely satisfied as to the cause of the disability. (iii) The period of leave granted shall be such as is certified by a medical board to be necessary and shall in no case' exceed two years.

(4 Subject to. any restrictions which the Governor-General in Council may by general order impose in the case of transfer to the service of an Indian State, a transfer to foreign service in India may be sanctioned by the local Government under which the Government servant transferred is serving. 111. A transfer to foreign service is not admissible unless : (a) The duties to be performed after the transfer are such as should, for public reasons, be rendered by a Govern ment servant, and (b) The Government servant transferred holds, at the time of transfer, a post paid from general revenues or holds a lien on such a, post. 112. If a. Government servant is transferred to foreign service while on leave he ceases, from tire date of such transfer, to be on leave and to draw leave-salary. 113. A Government servant transferred to foreign service will remain in the cadre in which he held a post' prior to his transfer, and may be given such substantive or officiating promotion in that cadre as the authority competent to order promotion may decide. In giving promotion, such authority will take into account—• (а) the nature of the work performed in foreign service, and ( б ) the promotion given to juniors in the cadre. 114. A Government servant in foreign service will draw pay from the foreign employer from the date on which he relinquishes charge of his post in Government service. Subject to any restric tions which the Governor-General in Council may by general order impose, the amount of his pay, the amount of joining time admissible to him and his pay during such joining time will be fixed by the authority sanctioning the transfer in consultation with the foreign employer. 115. While a Government servant is in foreign service, con tributions towards the cost of his pension must be paid to general revenues on his behalf. If the foreign service is in India, con tributions must be paid on account of the cost of leave-salary also.

Note. 1 .—Pensions, throughout this chapter include bonus, if any, payable to a Government servant’s credit in a provident fund. Note 2.—In the case of Government servants lent to His Majesty’s Government, or to British colonies or protectorates, the contribution is payable by the employer, except in the case of Governmelit servants lent to the War Office, whose contributions are paid in accordance with special arrangements with the War Office, 17301 A &lt;5116. Contributions will be calculated on the pay drawn in foreign service. In return for the contributions the Governor- General in Council or the local Government, as the case may be, accepts the charge for the pension, and if the foreign service is in India the leave-salary, of the Government servant. In calcu lating leave-salary and pension, the pay drawn in foreign service, less such part of it as may be paid as contribution, will count as pay for the purpose of rule 9 (2). 117. The rate of contributions payable on account of pension and leave-salary shall be such as the Governor-General in Council may by general order prescribe. 118. In addition to the contributions prescribed under rule 117, subscribers to any of the following pension funds must pay to Government a contribution equal to one-fourth or one-sixth &gt;t the premium paid to the fund :— (i) Bengal Uncovenanted Service Family Pension Fund ... hi) Bombay Uncovenanted Service Family Pension Fund— (1) Subscribers who joined the fund on or before the I2th Novem ber, 1900 (2) Those who joined after that date hii) Bengal and Madras Service Family Pen sion Fund lie Ik 0 ^ uperp One-fourth.

Subject to any general orders of the Governor-General in Council, a local Government sanctioning a transfer to foreign service may— (a) remit the contributions due in any specified case or class of cases, and (b) make rules prescribing the rate of interest, if any, to be levied on overdue contributions. 120. A Government servant in foreign service may not elect to withhold contributions and to forfeit the right to count as duty in Government service the time spent in foreign employ. The contribution paid on his behalf maintains his claim to pension, or to pension and leave-salary, as the case may be, in accordance with the rules of the service of which he is a member. Neither he nor the foreign employer has any right of property in a con tribution paid, and no claim for refund can be entertained. 121. A Government servant transferred to foreign service may not, without the sanction of the local Government, accept a }&gt;enRion or gratuity from his foreign employer in respect of such service. 122.

A Government servant in foreign service, if appointed to v officiate in a post in Government service, will draw pay calculated on the pay of the post in Government service on which he holds a lien and that of the post in which he officiates. His pay in foreign service will not be taken into account in fixing his pay. 125. A Government servant reverts from foreign service to Government service on the date on which he takes charge of his post in Government service; provided that, if he takes leave on the conclusion of foreign service before rejoining his post, his reversion shall take effect from such date as the local Government on whose establishment he is borne may decide. 126.

We would now explain that in 1913 Sir Percy Cox, when proposing the re-appointment of a whole-time Treasury Officer at Bushire, recommended an incremental pay of Rs. 250-5-300 a month. But since the Treasury work was not, in our opinion, such as to justify the creation of a permanent appoint ment, we suggested the temporary appointment of a Treasury Officer or a period of tw r o years on a pay of Rs. 250 a month, and it has remaine^ a figure ever since. But with the outbreak of war the Treasury Officer s du ies and responsibilities increased very considerably ; and further the Resrdent has now given his opinion that, even when times are normal, a xe pay 0 per mensem is not sufficient for a gazetted officer in Bus ire 0 6 . the Treasury Officer, who, it should be explained, does not participate in the special concession granted to the non-gazetted establishment. 3. la the circumstances, we are of opinion that the Treasury Officer's pay needs revision, and accordingly recommend t at i 6 .

War has rendered re-organisation and regulation of financial arrangements of Bushire Residency impossible while duties of Treasury officer have increased so largely owing to same cause that it is not possible to abolish appointment on termination on 16th July 1916 of present sanctioned period of 2 years.

Your despatch dated 2nd July, No. 216. Chief Conservator of Forests, Bombay. In view of general financial position 1 am disposed to postpone proposals of this kind which obviously are of no immediate urgency. What are your views ? From Viceroy, 9th September 1914. P. —Reference to your telegram of 19th ultimo. It would he com paratively ineffective to postpone ordinary administrative proposals requiring your sanction, unless this were accompanied by suspension temporarily of Local Governments’ own powers, or by curtailing definitely their Budgets for current financial year. With regard to the latter point, it seems to us undesirable, both for political reasons and from point of view of adminis trative convenience and efficiency, that there should be any interference with programmes of expenditure provided specifically for Departmental and Provincial Budgets. We propose, however, that we should instinct Local Governments that new expenditure, unless of special urgency, oi of relatively small amount, should not be incurred in current year except in cases where it was specifically included in the Budget. 1 he result of such oideis will be that fortuitous lapses, instead of being reappropriated for new out ay, will fall in. At the present time it seems very desirable to avoid reduction of employment, and for this reason we are averse from arbitrary retrench ments which, if enforced, would probably imply large curtailment of iubiic The nex/point is consideration of newly made proposals which involve expenditure. We think it better so long as it is feasible to carry on under ordinary conditions the business of administration m order to avoid inconvenient accumulation of work. This will, of course, be subject to suci natural retardation of normal activity as will automatically follow ±rom the preoccupation of many departments with questions arising from conditions ^^mportant new schemes so approved by your Lordship or by Local Governments or Administrations cannot, under the above-mentioned restrictions, be brought into effect until admitted into Budge for next yea, unless they are specially urgent, or have already been included this ye ( Budget 'in connection with next year’s Budget the whole question of retrenchment of expenditure will naturally be considered anew by us, especially if the war is prolonged and grave effects follow.

No. 1730 , dated Bushire, the 4 th August ^ 12 . From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, —- To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour, with the highest respect, to urge the Government of India to take into their wise and sympathetic consideration the claims of the Persian Gulf Residency, on its comparative merits, to be raised to the status of a First Class Residency, both on administrative grounds and in view of the increasing extent and impoitance of the interests with which it is charged. 2. Approaching the subject first from the purely administrative standpoint, I beg to observe that (*) the past decade has witnessed a large increase in the personnel of gazetted Political and Consular Officers serving within the sphere. Thus, whereas before 1900 they were only 7 in number besides the Resident, namely, the First Assistant, and the Extra Assistant and Residency Surgeon at Bushire, the Political Agent and Agency Surgeon at Muscat, and the Consular Representatives at Kerman and Mohammerah, they now number 18 exclusive of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz (wde sub-enclosure 1). (it) As a natural result of this creation and development of gazetted posts there has been a steady i:'crease year by year in the volume of letter correspondence, failing to the Residency; correspondence which has become quadrupled in the last 20 years and double in the last io, and is still increasirg at the rate of about 5 per cent, per annum (vide sub-enclosure 2). (m) There has also been a very large increase, both as regards receipts and issues, in the telegraphic correspondence, the volume of which has increased 8 times in the past 10 years and is still increas ing at the rate of nearly 10 per cent, per annum. I may mention that by far the greater proportion of the telegraph work is in cypher and forms a very heavy item in the ministerial duties of the post; a fact which has been recognised by Mr. J. B. Wood in his report to Government on the working of the Residency Office. (Letter No. 9, dated Bushire, 24th March 1912, to which I beg a reference—Extract sub-enclosure 3). The increase results from no preventable cause, being due partly to the insecure state of the roads, which makes correspondence by letter futile • partly to the acceleration of business methods and machinery in general; and partly again to the fact that of late years the affairs of Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf have entered more prominently into the arena of Middle Eastern politics. (iv) The development of lively foreign competition for the trade of the Gulf and the entry, on regular lines, of powerful German and Russian Steamship Companies into the carrying trade and the necessity on our part to lese no effort to keep the competition in check has entailed a much closer attention than of old on t e part of British representatives in general and of the Resident in particular, to the problems and openings of commerce within his sphere. in checking it,(b) the unfortunately frequent visitations of plague and cholera in different ports in the Gulf during the last few years and the extension of the Quarantine Administration in the hands of British Medical Officers under the general and political supervi sion of the Resident. I may add that the quarantine work needs the most watchful attention from the political point of view, so prone are jealous Foreign representatives in the Gulf and on the sanitary Board at Tehran (and in a lesser degree at Constantinople) to use the quarantine question as a channel for the pursuit of political game. 3 . In the foregoing paragraphs I have dealt only with increases in the administrative duties and responsibilities of the post which have actually taken place during the^ last decade. I may leave this aspect of the subject with the mention of certain other developments in the immediate future which will further increase their volume. M The installation of several Wireless Stations with their connected establishments. {b) The supervision of the working of the lighting and buoyage scheme for the Gulf. (c) The working of the Pilgrims Ships Act. (d) The constitution of the Residency as a Court of Appeal under several existing or contemplated Orders in Council, covering the whole sphere of Southern Persia and the shores of the Persian Gulf. (e) Possible transfer of charge and execution of Public Works in the Gulf to a provincial establishment, to be incorporated in the Residency and supervised by an Officer of the Royal Engineers seconded from the Public Works Department as Secretary to the Resident for Public Works.

Wood, Esq., C.I.E., Foreign Department, on special duty, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. **»*#*» As an illustration of the volume of work now performed by the Residency Office, I may mention that the number of the receipts and issues has risen in •Figure, include telegram.. lhe IaSt 10 y ear S fr °m 2,682 and 2,747 in 1901 to 7,936 and 8,156 in 1911.* A further illustration of the responsibility of the Resident is afforded by the fact that the number of cypher telegrams received and despatched by him in 1911 amounted to 1,609, while the number dealt with during the three weeks of the present month actually amounts to 300. I think that I may safely assert that there is no local office in India which has anything like the volume of secret and important telegraphic correspondence that falls to the lot of the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. It is difficult to compare his work with that of officers of the same rank in India, since the conditions are so greatly dissimilar. But the time is, I think, fast approaching, when the Government of India must consider whether the arduous and responsible character of the Resident’s duties does not demand the raising of his status and the scale of his establishment to that of a First Class Resident. In any case, it is clear that with a responsibility so grave and so pressing it would be the height of folly to hamper his work by insisting on further curtailment.5 Enclosure No 2 .

Ur ' / V ' f ' Lorimer, during his charge as Acting Resident, found that the congestion of work had been if anything under- stated by Sir P.

The two specific causes which V' have mainly led to the overburdening of the Extra Assistant Resident, viz (1) the introduction of the Office Allowance system in the Consular posts subordinate to Bushire, and { (2) the lighting and buoyage scheme in the Persian Gulf, may to some extent *extent diminish; and the Govt, of Indie - than, for the present propose that the additional appointment should be for two years only to tide over the period of greatest difficulty.

C.S I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department’ Simla. * I have the honour to address G overnment in regard to the gazetted and minis terial staff of my office, and in this connection to invite a reference to this office letter No. 2386^ dated the 19th September 1909, in which Major Trevor recon&gt;- mended the amalgamation of the duties of Extra Assistant Eesident and Treasury Officer, and that of Superintendent, in the person of the former, and the abolition of the latter. 2. Major Trevor based his recommendation on the ground that an officer of the Levant Service having been appointed as Vice-Consul at Bushire and the Extra Assistant Resident having been thereby relieved of the Consular work which he had hitherto performed, it would be possible for the latter to perform a certain portion of the duties of the Superintendent in addition to his own as Extra Assis tant and Treasury Officer. 3. In the note on “ Bushire ” which formed an enclosure to my letter 2106 of August 1910, I endorsed Major Trevor’s proposal though not without some misgiving and mainly in the hope that the modified system of accounts then under contemplation would lead to a reduction in the Treasury Branch of the office. These hopes, however, I regret to say, have not been fulfilled. 4. In paragraph 3 of their letter No. 2085-Est.' A., dated July 6th, 1912, the Government of India were pleased to say that they recognised that in distant and isolated posts it was difficult except at excessive cost to maintain a clerical establishment capable of dealing with accounts on the lines prescribed by audit codes, and decided on the analogy of the system prevailing in Consulates under the London Foreign Office to initiate a scheme of Office Allowances with a view to the reduction of clerical labour. That this has been the result as regards offices subordinate to this Residency is, I think, or at any rate will eventually be the case. The reverse, however, has been the effect upon my own office, where the introduction of the new scheme has in practice transferred to my shou ders a large portion of the supervisory duties hitherto performed by the Comptroller, India Treasuries. That this has been the case is, I venture respectfully to think, perhaps due to a misconception as to the system prevailing m Consulates under the London Foreign Office. This system, as 1 understand it, consists, so far P ers is concerned in the grant to a Consular Officer of a sum varying from £200 per Anum to £300 per annum for the upkeep of his office Beyond an enumeration ,mnum to pe rly be charged to the allowance m question ('.■»* of the items which may propm-V De . g ^ ^ to its page 36 of the Consular Instructi™., 1907? n ^ ^ allowance drawn quarterly expenditure. .Noy® 0 ^7 Acoounte Current ” with regard to the same both and an entry m the Chief Clerk of the Foreign Office, London, are sub- specifically sanctioned for political purposes.

Under the old scheme, the duty of seeing that funds provided for a particular object were expended on that object, fell on the Comptroller, India Treasuries. fT This duty now naturally falls on my own office, and it is in this connection es pecially that heavy extra work has devolved on the Treasury Officer. 7. In paragraph II (/) of the memorandum which formed an enclosure to this office letter No. 424, dated the 3rd September 1905,1 noted certain of the difficulties under which the Treasury Branch of this office laboured, owing to the miscella neous accounts work which apart from bona fide Treasury work, it was called upon to perform, and I now venture to draw attention to one or two further points in the same connection which do not find mention in that memorandum. First among these I would put the large amount of work connected with the Indian sowars of up-country escorts, i.e., escorts attached to Foreign Office Consu lates and the Legation. This work results from Bushire being the channel through which in certain cases sowars of the various escorts mentioned remit money to their families in India, and through which their postal correspondence is conducted. Both entail a very considerable amount of correspondence, both with the Post Office, when money orders fail to reach their destination, and with the Consulates con cerned, and also the upkeep of a mass of intricate accounts in small sums, the set tlement of which is by no means facilitated by the difficulties of inter-communi cations with stations up-country. 8. Closely connected with this question is the frequent use made of this Resi dency for what may be termed, for lack of a better word “ Forwarding Agency ” work, i.e., requests by officers up-country to arrange for the clearing of goods both private and Government property from the Custom House, the payment of neces sary fees, arrangements for their despatch up-country, etc., etc. The presence of our troops in Southern Persia has not unnaturally led to a very considerable increase in this type of work. 9. I beg respectfully to say, however, that I do not draw attention to the points above mentioned in any spirit of complaint. I mention them merely to indicate the type of miscellaneous work which of late years has shown a marked tendency to develop, and which forms an ever increasing drain on the time of the Treasury Office. The work, however, is due to specific and known causes, namely, the presence of our escorts and troops in Persia and if not performed by this office, would have to be dealt with by other means no less costly to Government. It may be urged that work of this nature, so far as it is connected with the presence of our troops, might be performed by the Military authorities stationed at Bushire. I have in this connection received every possible assistance from the Officer Commanding the troops here, but it is difficult, stationed as our troops are 7 miles from the town, for him to co-operate effectively, and correspo ndence with the Customs Department and the making out of the necessary declaration forms, all of which have to be in Persian, has perforce to be done in my office. 10. I have dealt above mainly with that portion of the work which falls on my Extra Assistant as Treasury Officer, and I now turn to a consideration of certain of the other duties quite apart from Treasury and Accounts work which he is at present expected to perform. The work which undoubtedly takes up most time and which perhaps interferes more with the routine work of the office than any other is the continual “ inter viewing ” which the Extra Assistant is called upon to do, as much often as half the day being employed in this manner. The questions dealt with are mainly appli cations for Tazkereh Passes, applications by pilgrims for pecuniary assistance, complaints by British subjects, disputes between local boatmen, the coal establish ment and the ships of His Majesty’s Navy in regard to the discharges and loading of coal, discussions with Persian workmen and merchants in regard to the price of0 ^ SKTSt S i'- :St'£’£“• “ a '• ^uial^know^edgeoHh^lora^dialect^d^certa^ofthe^uestion^dealt^tMnyolv' the cleiks m tke offi - - ,, “• Th&lt; : nl0re important of other branches of the Residency work dealt with by the Extra Assistant are the registering of all inward and outward confidential letters, the entire charge of the coal depot, the supervision of the Toshakhana, and the upkeep of the Residency launch. Each one of these duties may not involve any very vast amount of work by itself, but their sum total, necessitating as they often do frequent and lengthy absences from the office, cannot but interfere, as I think the Government of India will agree, with the proper execution of the Extra Assistant’s duties qua Treasury Officer. 12. A further duty which will now fall to that branch of the office under the more immediate supervision of the Extra Assistant is that connected with the administrative arrangements of the scheme of lighting and buoving in the Persian Gulf. In paragraph 5 of my letter No. 1805, dated 11th August 1912,1 recommended that until a special officer had been deputed to be the Lighting and Surveying authority for the Gulf, the Besident should be that authority for the time being. The work connected with this scheme has already attained dimensions with which I find it exceedingly difficult to cope, and though a great deal of it is doubtless due to the extra work inseparable from the inception of any scheme of so extensive a nature, I foresee that a considerable amount of additional work will be thrown permanently by it on this office. 13. Summed up briefly, the position is that after two years’ experience (my late ex-Extra Assistant left in April 1911), I find that the amalgamation of the post of the Extra Assistant Besident and Treasury Officer, and that of Superin tendent has not been found workable. It has resulted in throwing on the Extra Assistant Besident and Treasury Officer a larger share of work than he is able to perform and there is a danger therefore of both branches of the work falling to him, suffering in consequence. As the Government of India are aware, I am by the terms of the last para graph of paragraph 6 of Foreign Department letter hio. 2085-Est.A., dated 6th July 1912, held directly responsible for seeing that the Treasury work at Bushire does not suffer by the new arrangements outlined in that communication. I would, however, venture most respectfully to represent that under the cir cumstances to which I have drawn attention above, the responsibility is one which I am compelled to accept with no inconsiderable amount of misgiv ing. 14. The Treasury work, as I have pointed out, is already heavy, and the c h ea ' tion of a new post in Luristan and the appointment of an Officer of the Indian Political Department to Shi^ will necessarily add to tnese duties. 15. In the above circumstances, I request the favourable consideration of Gov ernment to the appointment of a Treasury Officer in addition to that of the Extra Assistant Besident. My reasons for asking for a Treasury Officer and f tant are that Mr. P. J. Gandhy, the present mcumtent onoth pgts has served 24 years in the Persian ^ ^asp of good working know kdgii o . li ar ly fitted to perform those duties4 16. I therefore propose the creation of a fresh post of a Treasury Officer on a salary of Rs. 250-5-300, plus a house rent allowance of Rs. 25, thus involving an extra charge to Government of Rs. 3,700 per annum. The usual proposition statement in connection with this proposal is being submitted through the Comp troller, India Treasuries, and I earnestly request that the Government of India will be pleased to take the proposal into their favourable consideration. No. G. A. 670, dated Calcutta, the 18th June 1913. From—J. C. Mitra, Esq., Officiating Comptroller, India Treasuries, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In forwarding herewith a proposition statement received from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, duly verified, I have the honour to state as follows :— (1) The average costs of the appointments of F rst and Second Assistant Resident should be that of a time-scale officer of the Political Depart ment, i.e., Rs. 1,656-10-8 and Rs. 700 respectively as shown in the proposition statement. (2) The average cost of the appointment of Surgeon should be Rs. 850 and his exchange compensation allowance Rs. 53-2-0 instead of Rs. 916, and Rs. 57-4-0 respectively as shown in the statement. (3) The appointment of “ Mobile Assistant ” is not a permanent one. A medical officer in Military employ is, in times of epidemic, temporarily deputed to the Gulf, and receives for the period of such deputation, an allowance of Rs. 10 a day and travelling allowance under Civil Service Regulations, in addition to his Military pay and allowances. The present incumbent draws pay as Captain Rs. 400, staff salary Rs. 100, exchange compensation allowance Rs. 31-4-0 and deputa tion allowance Rs. 10 a day. As it is not a permanent appointment it need not be shown in the proposition statement. ( ^ i C, ] k is*!. ;*** 1 j'** l&amp;l j'So p ? 5m India, Foreign Secretary's No J3.VI, dated 5&gt;6 MAR 19V.

The necessity for it is open to doubt in view of the following considerations (а) The duties which wiU be allotted to the new Treasury Officer have not been specffied the average is less than 2 bills a day. ( б ) Presumably the new officer will act as visory duties mentioned m paragraphs - uttpr it is no doubt stated in the concluding portion of paragraph 5 o „desirable that some sort of check should be exercised on the expenditure from the contract allowances. It was intended, however, that this check should be of a general nature only, to prevent any striking misuse of the grants, and not a minute and exhaustive examination of details such as is carried out in an audit office. Otherwise spending officers are deprived of that full discretion in the expenditure of these grants, which the new system was intended to give them. Any real audit of expenditure would be done more effectually by the Comptroller than in your office. If those supervisory duties have thrown much work on your office a more suitable remedy would probably be the simplification of the form of accounts pre scribed by you in accordance with the orders contained in paragraph 3 (5) of Foreign Department letter No. 2085-Est. A., of the 6 th July 1912. (c) Your office will be relieved of the additional work in connection with the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf, as soon as the scheme has been properly launched, and the administrative arrangements taken over by the Director, Eoyal Indian Marine, in accordance with the orders contained in Foreign Department letter No. 1253- E.-A., dated the 10th June 1913. 3. For these reasons the Government of India are disposed to think that there would not be sufficient work for the new officer, if appointed, and that in view of the temporary nature of much of the increase of work the creation of a new permanent appointment would not be justi fied. If, however, you are still of opinion that it is necessary, will you favour us with your remarks on the criticisms made above ? r Fn To n Tom Pro.

From-LiEUTENANT-CoLONEL Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Hon’ble Mr. J. B. Wood, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. r ■ ' Please see Wilkinson’s demi-official letter to me, dated October 17th, regarding the pro posed creation of a new appointment of “Treasury Officer,” Bushire. He will, I hope, pardon my addressing myself in reply to you, but I do so as I should like to take this opportunity of re presenting to Foreign Department the very difficult and precarious position in which the Bushire office as a whole is placed at the present juncture, and in view of your knowledge of the local conditions, it is easier to discuss the situation with you. You will see from the record that in August 1912, in my letter No. 1730, I addressed Gov- _ „ ^ ernment urging that the volume and responsibility Pro. Nos. 275-276 m st. B., Octo er 913. 0 £ ^ wor k 0 f this post had reached a stage at which it was entitled on administrative grounds to be regarded and equipped as a first class Resi dency. Nearly one and a half years have since passed, during which the position has grown more and more burdensome, but no official reply has been received to the above repre sentation nor has any relief been granted. But I am aware form incidental remarks made in pri vate communications which I have since received that the Foreign Department regard the proposal with sympathy; and Wilson, my late second Assistant, who knew of the correspondence, made casual enquiries at the India Office when he was at home recently as to whether the pro posal had progressed at all, and although he learnt that nothing had been received on the sub ject from India, yet he derived the impression that the heavy task of the Bushire Residency was recognised there and that if representations did come from India, they would be likely to re ceive sympathetic examination at home. Thus the atmosphere surrounding the proposal seems a propitious one, and for this fact I am most thankful; but the months are dragging into years and meanwhile the actual situation on the spot becomes administratively a greater strain on those concerned from day to day. I am leaving Bushire and shall not be personally affected perhaps much longer; but my object in writ ing to you now is to urge that the position in the ministerial office is becoming desperate and I fear it cannot continue much longer on the present footing without every possibility of a break down. The state of things at which we have thus arrived is merely the result of a deliberate progres sive policy pursued in the Gulf and it needs to be faced; for Government cannot expect to obtain the benefits accruing from increased representation and enterprise m this sphere, and at the same time demand that the central office and machinery which is responsible for the focussing, collating and transmission of information to them should receive no reinforcement in the numerical strength or equipment of its component parts. Each new office and each new scheme has neces sarily imposed its extra quotum of work on the various members comprising the office staff and matters have now reached a breaking point. I have already asked for a Treasury Officer, and it is a matter of immediate concern that that i nave dirc&lt;uxy * / sanc tion- the creation thereof alone will not, however, appointment should recei y needed is a thorough recasting of the lines on which ttMXTsrantTaboMon n of non-pensionable clerical posts, and a very material increase in the ministerial appointments of this office. u voiUr Bpflfpatnre incidental to the elevation of the post to firs 13 These changes wou nat y ^ wai t indefinitely for that development They have class status, but I do not see y^ ^ ^ ^ inviewof thi8 pIactlcal local urgency in fact become urg^t and l J m J e theil recommendations to the Secretary of the Government of India will see tn y could reach Lon don by the time I do, the State forthwith. If that be P oss * e be expe dited by the fact of my being at hand to give in- StooUn^oXTScalLaring on which the India Office might desire further enlighten- I would, however, ^particffiarlyreipmst eonsideration of the question of a Treasury OffiT The creation of this a PP'’ f XTay tS I’coidd 6 not^continue*tcTaccept' existing responsibilities in regard to accounts matters ,n this office unless sanction to its creation were accorded.The observations made above anent the importance of keeping the machinery of the Residency Office abreast of current needs, apply equally in principle to our out-offices which, as you know, also came within the scope of the peremptory retrenchment order which emanated from Government in 1910. In that year in some cases reductions of clerical establishment were ordered, and in others pensionable posts were made non-pensionable, a course which in practice has resulted in it being impossible to find suitable candidates to fill them. This policy of retrenchment has been put in practice at a somewhat unfortunate epoch and is generating a general spirit of discontent amongst officers which is in no wise lessened by the persecution (I can use no other word) from which they now suffer at the hands of the Comp troller, India Treasuries. Of the majority of officers who select the Gulf as a career, it may, I think, be said that they do so out of a genuine interest in the work in these parts They arrive expecting work and keen to do it; and to such, as can only be expected, the absence of the necessary machinery to en able them to perform their duties efficiently can but be disheartening. Moreover, apart from the effect of this policy on our own officers, there is another aspect of the case which needs careful watching (specially in places like Mohammerah or Bahrain where considerable British or British Indian communities have formed) and that is, that it is the natural tendency, and indeed obligation of, a Government representative to see that work for Government always takes precedence of local and mercantile work. The inevitable result of this is, when his office is undermanned, that it is impossible for our representative to give adequate time and sympa thetic attention to local mercantile needs, any neglect of which, however, speedily produces a discontented community. I will now reply to Wilkinson’s letter in regard to the Treasury Officer. I cannot but think that the main point of the letter to which it is a reply has not been suffi ciently appreciated ; namely, that the need for a Treasury Officer at Bush ire is due to the fact that the combined duties of Treasury Officer, Accounts Officer and Extra Assistant are more than any one man can perform in an efficient manner. As regards the Extra Assistant I have in my letter No. 1428 of May 4th 1913, already out lined the duties which fall on him as such, as fully as it is in my power to do on paper, and more I cannot say than that the demands on his time as Treasury and Accounts Officer are seriously hampering my work in other directions and have created a situation with which I am no longer able to cope. As regards his duties as Treasury Officer, I am not sufficiently acquainted with the technical terminology of the Accounts Department to be able to differentiate between what is &amp;ond /ide treasury work and what is not. What, however, I meant by the term “Treasury Officer,” when I wrote my letter, was an officer who would deal with financial work connected with my own office and that of those under me. Perhaps “ Treasury and Accounts Officer ” would be a more suitable designation for him. As to the nature and extent of that work, apart from local supervisory duties connected with the new Contract Scheme, with which I will deal later, a good example is afforded by the series of communications under date November 4th which go to you officially by this mail. The latter are merely a small selection from a considerablejvolume of similar correspondence which has occupied far more than a fair share of my own time and that of my first Assistant, Extra Assis tant and Treasury Officer. As regards the supervisory duties connected with the new contract scheme it is suggested that these might be considerably reduced by the simplification of the form of accounts pre scribed by myself in accordance with the orders contained in paragraph 3 (5) of Foreign Depart ment letter No. 2085-Est. A., of 6th July 1912. The suggestion is doubtless due to my failure to define more explicitly what exactly was involved by the word supervision. This can perhaps best be explained by describing briefly the system of check established in connection with contract grants. The office allowance has been sub-divided into roughly a dozen sub-heads. At the beginning of ^ach financial year subordinate offices submit statements showing the estimated expenditure for the year under each sub-head, and at the end of each month returns showing the totals of the actual expenditure incurred and expenditure to date. The estimates submitted at the commencement of the financial year are, I may mention, purely of general guidance. An officer is in no way bound by them and is always at complete liberty to exceed the amount estimated for any particular sub-head provided always he does not exceed the total of the office allowance. Further, no details of expenditure are asked for from subordinate offices nor are vouchers -of any kind whatsover submitted by them. , . - j • ,7 It will thus b© seen that the only check possible in fliia 11 j. •. officers is a careful scrutiny of the progressive total e^ f ° n he ments made by their monthly returns. There is no question whatever^/* ' U &lt;* m ““ rred t * 1 ® m as shown m of that kind I entirely agree could be done more effectiwW Wt audlt of expenditure.” W ork the scrutiny does mvolve is the camw”ofttSes 0ll r ^ item of disbursement really means and has a general idea nf • • T W ° • j nows w bat each l - , “ t 1 ' As regards the prospect of being relieved of work in connection with the lightimr and buoyage there must always remain a c-rtam amount of correspondence with this Ind also work for the Lawrence, even after the lighthouse tender has been provided as all reports from out stations will have to he sent through this office, which will also torve to d».l with Foreign representatives m matters of lighting and buoyage aSecting their shipping. I am afraid this has been a lengthy screed, but the subject is a very lively one for us at present, and I have thought it best to put matters fully before you. G. M. Press, Simla,—No. 530 F.

H, McMahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E.- Siml feeCretar7 to tiie Gover nnient of India in the Foreign Department’ , . } ^ a I. e t , he hoi ^ )Ur to ad( lress G overnment in regara to the gazetted and minia- tenai statt of my ofhee, and m this connection to invite a reference to this office letter No. 2386, dated the 19th September 1909, in which Major Trevor recom- mended the amalgamation of the duties of Extra Assistant Resident and Treasury Officer, and that of Superintendent, in the person of the former, and the abolition of the latter. 2 . Major Trevor based his recommendation on the ground that an officer of the Levant Service having been appointed as Vice-Consul at Bushire and the Extra Assistant Resident having been thereby relieved of the Consular work which he had hitherto performed, it would be possible for the latter to perform a certain portion of the. duties of the Superintendent in addition to his own as Extra Assis tant and Treasury Officer. 3. In the note on “ Bushire ” which formed an enclosure to my letter No. 2106 of August 1910, I endorsed Major Trevor’s proposal though not without some misgiving and mainly in the hope that the modified system of accounts then under contemplation would lead to a reduction in the Treasury Branch of the office. These hopes, however, I regret to say, have not been fulfilled. 4. In paragraph 3 of their letter No. 2085-Est. A., dated July 6th, 1912, the Government of India were pleased to say that they recognised that in distarrt and isolated posts it was difficult except at excessive cost to maintain a clerical establishment capable of dealing with accounts on the lines prescribed by audit codes, and decided on the analogy of the system prevailing in Consulates under the London Foreign Office to initiate a scheme of “ Office Allowances ” with a view to the reduction of clerical labour. That this has been the result as regards offices subordinate to this Residency is, I think, or at any rate will eventually be the case. The reverse, however, has been the effect upon my own office, where * the introduction of the new scheme has in practice transferred to my shoulders a large portion of the supervisory duties hitherto performed by the Comptroller, India Treasuries. That this has been the case is, I venture respectfully to think, , perhaps due to a misconception as to the system prevailing in Consulates under the London Foreign Office. This system, as I understand it, consists, so far as Persia is concerned, °in the grant to a Consular Officer of a sum varying from £200 per annum to £300 per annum for the upkeep of his office. Beyond_ an enumeration of the items which may properly be charged to the allowance in question (vide page 36 of the Consular Instructions, 1907) no rules are laid down in regard to its expenditure. No accounts beyond a receipt for the allowance drawn quarterly and an entry in the “ Quarterly Accounts Current ” with regard to the same both of which are sent direct to the Chief Clerk of the Foreign Office, London, are sub mitted, nor does its tMal include any items specifically sanctioned for political urposes. 5 A glance at the details which go to make up the totals of the various office llowances laid down in Foreign Department letter No. 2085-Est. A dated the 6th i 191 2 will I think, show that the latter are on a completely different footing, nd in consequence need different treatment. There will be found included m the ffice allowance of one Consulate expenditure on behalf of a hospital, of another (tisnensarv • in a third the allowance is swelled by special grants to meet charges 1 connection with “ touring,” etc., etc. All charges of this nature have at one time another received the careful consideration of Government and have been .rJrl mainlv on political grounds with a specific object in view, and it is rtCeforr like it, intendednor would it be in the interests of Government fVinstance an officer with a disinclination to tour expended his allotment on 455FDj / vi' ^ r r embellishing the Consulate premises, or finding himself pressed for funds in other directions, abolished his dispensary. 6 Under the old scheme, the duty of seeing that funds provided for a particular obiect were expended on that object, fell on the Comptroller India Treasuries. This duty now naturally falls on my own office, and it is m this connection es pecially that heavy extra work has devolved on the Treasury Officer. 7 In paragraph II (/) of the memorandum which formed an enclosure to this office letter No. 424, dated the 3rd September 1905,1 noted certain of the difficulties under which the Treasury Branch of this office laboured, owing to the miscella neous accounts work which apart from Iona fide Treasury work, it was called upon to perform, and I now venture to draw attention to one or two further pomts in the same connection which do not find mention in that memorandum. First among these I would put the large amount of work connected with the Indian sowars of up-country escorts, ®.e., escorts attached to Foreign Office Consu lates and the Legation. This work results from Bushire being the channel through which in certain cases sowars of the various escorts mentioned remit money to their families in India, and through which their postal correspondence is conducted Both entail a very considerable Amount of correspondence, both with the Post Office, when money orders fail to reach their destination, and with the Consulates con cerned, and also the upkeep of a mass of intricate accounts m small sums, the set tlement of which is by no means facilitated by the difficulties of mter-commum- cations with stations up-country. 8. Closely connected with this question is the frequent use made of this Resi dency for what may be termed, for lack of a better word “ Forwarding Agency work, i.e., requests by officers up-country to arrange for the clearing of goods both private and Government property from the Custom House, the payment of neces sary fees, arrangements for their despatch up-country, etc., etc. The presence of our troops in Southern Persia has not unnaturally led to a very considerable increase in this type of work. 9. I beg respectfully to say, however, that I do not draw attention to the points above mentioned in any spirit of complaint. I mention them merely to indicate the type of miscellaneous work which of late years has shown a marked tendency to develop, and which forms an ever increasing drain on the time of the Treasury Office. The work, however, is due to specific and known causes, namely, the presence of our escorts and troops in Persia and if not performed by this office, would have to be dealt with by other means no less costly to Government. It may be urged that work of this nature, so far as it is connected with the presence of our troops, might be performed by the Military authorities stationed at Bushire. I have in this connection received every possible assistance from the Officer Commanding the troops here, but it is difficult, stationed as our troops are 7 miles from the town, for him to co-operate effectively, and correEpoader.ee with the Customs Department and the making out of the necessary declaration forms, all of which have to be in Persian, has perforce to be done in my office. r \ 10. I have dealt above mainly with that portion of the work which falls on m y Extra Assistant as Treasury Officer, and I now turn to a consideration of certain of the other duties quite apart from Treasury and Accounts work which he is at present expected to perform. The work which undoubtedly takes up most time and which perhaps interferes more with the routine work of the office than any other is the continual inter viewing ” which the Extra Assistant is called upon to do, as much often as half the day being employed in this manner. The questions dealt with are mainly appli cations for Tazkereh Passes, applications by pilgrims for pecuniary assistance, complaints by Biitish subjects, disputes between local boatmen, the coal establish ment and the ships of His MajestyA Navy in regard to the discharges and loading of coal, discussions with Persian workmen and merchants in regard to the price ofbuilding materials, and the cost of local purchases, in fact the hundred and one small details involved m the upkeep of the Eesidency and its appurtenances «„M T i he c ^ n f uct of w ®rk of all the above categories necessitates a good collo quial knowledge of the local dialect and certain of the questions dealt with involv- mg as they do important political principles, a thorough acquaintance with our attitude in regard to them It is not possible, therefore, for me to entrust this branch of the work to any of the clerks in the office even if their other duties allow ed. ot their undertaking it. 11. The more important of other branches of the Residency w r ork dealt with by the Extra Assistant are the registering of all inward and outward confidential letters, the entire charge of the coal depot, the supervision of the Toshakhana, and the upkeep of the Residency launch. Each one of these duties may not involve any very vast amount of work by itself, but their sum total, necessitating as they often do frequent and lengthy absences from the office, cannot but interfere, as I think the Government of India will agree, with the proper execution of the Extra Assistant’s duties qua Treasury Officer. 12. A further duty which will now fall to that branch of the office under the more immediate supervision of the Extra Assistant is that connected with the administrative arrangements of the scheme of lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf. In paragraph 5 of my letter No. 1805, dated 11th August 1912,1 recommended that until a special officer had been deputed to be the Lighting and Surveying authority for the Gulf, the Resident should be that authority for the time being. The work connected with this scheme has already attained dimensions with which I find it exceedingly difficult to cope, and though a great deal of it is doubtless due to the extra work inseparable from the inception of any scheme of so extensive a nature, I foresee that a considerable amount of additional work will be thrown permanently by it on this office. 13. Summed up briefly, the position is that after two years’ experience (my late ex-Extra Assistant left in April 1911), I find that the amalgamation of the post of the Extra Assistant Resident and Treasury Officer, and that of Superin tendent has not been found workable. It has resulted in throwing on the Extra Assistant Resident and Treasury Officer a larger share of work than he is able to perform and there is a danger therefore of both branches of the work falling to him, suffering in consequence. As the Government of India are aware, I am by the terms of the last para graph of paragraph 6 of Foreign Department letter No. 2085-Est.A., dated 6th July 1912, held directly responsible for seeing that the Treasury work at Bushire does not suffer by the new arrangements outlined in that communication. I would, however, venture most respectfully to represent that under the cir cumstances to which I have drawn attention above, the responsibility is one which I am compelled to accept with no inconsiderable amount of misgiv ing. 14. The Treasury 'work, as I have pointed out, is already heavy, and the crea tion of a new post in Luristan and the appointment of an Officer of the Indian Political Department to Shirz will necessarily add to these duties. 15. In the above circumstances, I request the favourable consideration of Gov ernment to the appointment of a Treasuiy Officer in addition to that of the Extra Assistant Resident. My reasons for asking for a Treasury Officer and not an additional Extra Assis- tant are that Mr. P. J. Gandhy, the present incumbent of both posts has now served 24 years in the Persian Gulf, 14 of which have been spent in Bushire He has a sood working knowledge both of Persian and Arabic and has a thorough grasp of focal ^stoms and conditions. He is thus peculiarly fitted to perform those duties which would in the ordinary course of events fall on the Extra Assistant and h Wh • in fUat rarmcitv are likely to be of more advantage to Government than would^e* those of an Jumbent nominated specially for that post from elsewhere. .16. I therefore propose the creation of afresh post of a Treasury Officer on a salary of Rs. 250-5-300, ylus a house rent allowance of Rs. 25, thus involving an extra charge to Government of Rs. 3,700 per annum. The usual proposition statement in connection with this proposal is being submitted through the Comp troller, India Treasuries, and I earnestly request that the Government of India will be pleased to take the proposal into their favourable consideration.
