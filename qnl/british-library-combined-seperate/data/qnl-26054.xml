The letter outlines the British Government's expectations in maintaining courteous relations with the Maskat [Muscat] authorities and stating that if the accounts of the Sultan's death are accurate they would expect the guilty to be brought to justice before friendly relations could be resumed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024174347.0x00002e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
