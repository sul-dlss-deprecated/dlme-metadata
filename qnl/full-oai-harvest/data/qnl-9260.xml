The Shaikh of Kuwait [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] exercised joint control over the Neutral Zone with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Shaikh of Kuwait was likely to seek the approval of the British Government before granting a concession in the Neutral Zone. The papers contain correspondence from some of the oil companies involved, principally the Burmah Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited, details of other (United States) companies involved in negotiations, and correspondence and memoranda from the India Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Political Agent, Kuwait, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait-Saudi Neutral Zone</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Burmah Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a9#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a9#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
