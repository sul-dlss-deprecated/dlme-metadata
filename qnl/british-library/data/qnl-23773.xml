I am having prepared another statement, for your information, relating to Import Rice business. end of February, 1928, the business done was steadily increasing, despite the fluctuations in the dollar-rupees exchange; and after that date the Hindu business shews a sharp falling-off, while the Arab business, which also had shewn a steady development, produces a marked sharp increase. Hence it seems right to infer that, owing to the withdrawal from Qatif, of the Hindu merchants, the business which could be done has swung across to the Arab merchants; but it cannot be inferred that the business has become less, although, consistent with the laws of supply and demand, the retail price of rice should (and has) become cheaper because of the larger stocks being carried at this time of the year. more closely than the Arab merchant because the Hindu business methods are much more competitive. The Hindu sells at practically a cash price for a small profit, while he has to meet interest charges (often amounting to on the value of his import; hence he is naturally anxious to sell quickly, and if the retail price be low, he may take a very trifling profit in order to clear himself. The Arab merchant, however, trades with his- own capital, and is consequently able to charge a higher price for his goods and to give a much longer period of credit for payment. Hence a phase of/r@tail prices, due to a glut in the market, as at present obtains, v/ould not affect the Arab merchant so closely as the Hindu. Personally, I do not think one can say there is a depression in trade—in fact rather the reverse; but there is certainly a depression in retail prices, which only the capitalist can easily bear; and if there is a falling-off in imports by the Bunniah merchants, it would be due to the From the enclosed statement, it will be noticed that up to the A period of cheaper retail prices would affect the Hindu merchant previous heavy buying, as is proved by the fact that the total during the past two months have exceeded normal expectations.%zx{ al SSLxxYxV, Baljrjein, ($xxl£. 1st September, 1929., Dear Mr Seyyid Saddiq Haeaan, Yesterday afternoon, I made it my duty to visit s.e.'Barpeta', to inspect the Passport work, which was proceeding satisfactorily.

The local charge for matches at sale is two annas per dozen boxes, i.e. Rs:1-8-0., per gross. Consequently the sale of these in the local oazar at this price ought to shew quite a handsome profit for the importer.

This steamer arrived here on 8th November, 1931, being, I understand^on a charter-party by the firm of Ranchodlal Purshotamdas Bros, of Bombay, whose local correspondent is the firm of Mustapha bin Abdullatif. She came from Batavia via Surabaya, Singapore, Bombay and ditch ,r andvi, and *1 ^'» v '°~ged at Bahrain 5,283 bags of sugar, coffee, and rice. Messrs Mustapha bin Abdullatif obtained permission from the G-overnmen'** of Bahrain to act as the steamer 1 s agents, and hi~ed Persian lighters locally, and discharged the ship during a heavy shumal gale. In my opinion)the worh was done badly, the lighters being overloaded, with the result that: 340 bags of rice, 431 TT TT sn^ar, 24 ' ' coffee, were damaged by sea-water, while in addition, 89 bags were lost over-board between ship and lighter, bringing the to+al of dsma^re to 684 bags, or thirteen per cent. The s.s. ,,r arly’ departed hence for Busreh on 9- 1 7-3i, having shipped 653 bundles of dates for Singapore; and she returned here on 23rd November, having loaded 23,574 packages in Busreh. From Bahrain she loaded 1,469 bundles of dates for Java, and departed on 24th November last. I hear that this ship’s offering to tahe Gulf cargo at Bombay led to the B.I.S.N.Coy 1 s reducing their rate of freight at once, which accounts for the heavy shipments by the subsequent upmail. ) f/'r/$! a ^ ft \ A , y i lb/ 1 *- t and ■Dnvm p' r, ~’I pTP-n ^ n/MTp A TV &lt; (y cD.O.No: Political Agency, Bahrain,the 16th December 1S31# Dear de GrenieP, The names and addresses you want are as follows:- Vice Admiral D # J.A,iullerton,0 # B.,D.S.0.,ruA., ConLmander-in-Ohief ,Dast Indies., O/o Post Laster.,Bombay.

The period of ten days Khanchi to commence from the day of the removal of cargo by the Import Yard, is unjustifiable to the cause of merchants as they are not expected to get delivery order from the Steamship Companies of the cargo until it is removed totally as part of the cargo requires either measurement or marks or counting or such other simi- liar reasons. That the cargo will not be delivered to the merchants be fore the Bill-of-3ntry is cleared fully. To put in a con crete- example if any steamer arrived on Saturday in port the cargo which required weighment (which ^orms a major por tion of the bulk cargo) will not be ready for delivery to some of the merchants before Wednesday evening while cargo which requires measurement by the shipping agent will not be ready for delivery before thursday evening or Saturday morn ing. Why and how this delay is caused is best known to you. Considering the above period which is beyond merchants power the only right period of Khanchi for him will be only 3 to 4 days. That this port has a very limit need of cargo for local con- sumption and is most dependent on outsiders where the cargo is shipped by crafts. These shipments are effected in consi deration of the winds which are not always favourable hence on occasions, it will be rather impossible to make the ship ments during such a limited small period.The existing charg- ges of Khanchi would make it impossible for any merchant to leave the cargo in the Import Yard. But to remove to his godown will deprive him of his benefit for Re-3xport refund. That the present world wide depression has obliged the mer chants to' order the stuff through the countries of origin in order to avoid the middle man’s profit and enter into competition with other gulf ports, the bills and documents where^are always through India whichccan not arrive here with the goods but will always be at least a week late than the stuffs hence all such cargo will always be liable to extra Khanchi which amounts to in ordinary cases more than margin of profit the merchants. That this port chiefly depends on ^atar and mainland to whom are accessable the ports of Dubai &amp; Koweit h r '.^j un less there is cheap market in Bahrein, the trade will be hampered heavily. That the new order reverts us the previous period of* Khanchi through the intervention of Colonel C.C.J.Barret, the then ^ Political Agent, who after discussion with the merchants and the Authorities concerned, had modified the old system after having satisfied that the merchants were quite justi fied in demands (a reference will satisfy). These facts should not be sight of. As regards the second and subsequent Khanchi there should be no^difference between first and other Khanchies. __i;o.G./22/.'',76.

BAHRAIN.On the morning of the 7th January 1933 I discussed the question of rewards to Customs officers with r.de Grenier, Director of Customs, 2. As I see it,the Customs Law is in force# lb was drawn up at our behest by :r,Bower in close consultation with ''ajor )aly andj even if we have no record^it is quite clear that the haw was brought into force with our knowledge and consent. It follows,therefore,that we must be bound by it and that half of any fine should be sent to the Director of Customs for distri bution among his officers in accordance with the conditions of the Law, equally,however,! think that the Law is a bad one as it stands^for it entitles a Customs officer to a reward even though he has done nothing to deserve it and may even encourage ill practice^, or example,if I (or let as say the Adviser; visit a steamer and happen to see a man go over the side with a bottle of brandy and call the attention of the Customs office to It,although he has shown no zeal or ability he is at present entitled to a share of any fine. Then suppose an employee of tne Customs is a rogue,he would be encouraged to bring a false * charge against a man for smuggling,let us say opium,and it would be an easy thing to introduce a stick or so of opium into a man’s kit. The Customs work is done in so much publicity that I doubt if this would be likely to become a a, Lft+H* practice but it is Just an example of result of the Law, 3, Ivr, de Grenier and 1 agreed that everything possible shouM be done to encourage a Customs officer to show zeal and also that it is far better for him to get a share of a not fine in a case in which he has perhaps/shown any particular zeal rather than that he should make his reward by some corrupt practice. 4. fo sura upt I said that if the question of a half fine was pressed officially I should have to ask for an alternation fir A Lr in the Law which would be most unfortunate,as it would discourage the Customs officers. I said, however,that I perfectly prepared to accept tho following procedure. I77; 2 . in each case the Director of Customs should say he recommends that half oij~ any fine should be given in some wording which did not make it savoui^can oraer to the Court: and that J perfectly satisfied to accept a wide interpretation of the word fceal',provided that he would MHt simply net recommend cases where the Customs officers had done nothing to serve a reward. I Fin^n that the wording of the recoim endations should not appear as an order to the Court to pay the amounts in question# 5. I think that this forms a practical solution of the tu- difficulties and^one thing we want to avoid is having a Customs J,aw altered owing to a strict legal interpretation.No, 2427 Political Agency, Bahrain The 27th July, 1946, To The Director of Customs, Bahrain.
