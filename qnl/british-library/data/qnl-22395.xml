A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the report for the year 19 11- 32 Annual series (No.5062). Since last year’s report the permanent popula tion has remained more-or-loss stationary and still numbers about 105,000. During the pearling season there is usually a large temporary increase in the population. The local clutoms department keeps no statistics of Import and exports, conse qaently these have to be prepared from steamers* and boats* manifests, access to which has been readily given by the courtesy of the Customs Director. * They are, therefore, incomplete, especially ^s regards ex ports to the mainland and Persian coast, which have all been carried in native boats and until qiit© recently wl out manifests, and over which the Customs Director had control owing to the merchandise having been shipped fro .a private godowns direct Into the boats without passing thrcu^f' the Customs House. &lt;*iite recently however at the suggestion of the Political Agent the Shaikh has issued stringent instructions that all goods must pass through the Customs House and steps are being taken to enforce production of manifests for all merchandise imported into and exported from Bahrain by native craft. A certain &lt;*iantity will still however undoubtedly be smuggled out of the Port. The statistics regarding movement of pearls and specie are very incomplete, as numbers of local pearl merchants, who travel to and from Bombay, also foreign pearl merchants, carry large (jiantitiee of pearls and specie in their luggage or on their person. Owing to absence of steamship service particularly duffing the pearl season a large cjiantity of pearls were exported by native boats to Bushire for shipment to India. There is no bank in Bahrain, and many lakhs of rupees are brought in .very year by r.giatered post in tha form of I Indian currency notes of 8?. 1,000/- and R!.500/-. It is, ol course, impossible to obtain statistics of all these sums.EFFECTS OF WAB« Th^ y«ar vender review ehowe a general improvement in the trade over the year 19 16-17. The retail prioee of all etaple food-stuffs were abnormally high throughout the year owing to high coat price and increased freight by steamship service as well as native craft. The Political Agent in consultation with the Chief of Bahrain was obliged to regulate prices of necessaries of life to avoid hoarding and profiteering* Owing to severe restrict ions on the export of specie from India, the pearl merchants experienced great difficulty in obtaining- funds for the purchase of pearls, and began to issue telegraphic orders (hundies) at a loss of from F.’40/— to E*.90/— per l£* 1,000/^ 'fe^Sugh the local general merchants who, in anticipation of this difficulty had imported, in lieu of specie, piece- goods, rice, wheat, coffee, and sugar in excess of the normal re cpireraents for the year, and who .ere, in conse- (pence, in urgent need of drafts for payment to their head offices in India. They took this opportunity to make large profits on exchange, and began to sell merchandise at a narrow margin so as to be able to keep the pearl merchants with sufficient funds for purchase of pearls, and at the same time obtain telegraphic orders from them for payment to their head offices in Bombay or Karachi. Towards the end of November 39 17 there was a glut in the piece-goods, coffee, wheat and rice partly in conscience of the overstocked market and partly due to absence of the usual visits of the overland merchants and caravans at this time of the year. In January 39 38 however, Kuwait merchants called here and large stock of foodstuffs was shipped to Kuwait. The restrictions in Kuwait soon put a stop to tnifc outlet, and the msrohants found thera.elves with a large stock* of goods, particularly piece-goods and rice at tne end of the official year. OPENING FOB BRITISH TRADE . The trade of the Bahrain Islands is to a large extent in the hands of Hindu andI I -•vand Indian .^uloarcjiiadan rcercJiantB, who liave had husinees connections with the Islands for over a centu^ry, and far the greater portion of the trade Is with India. Messrs Gray, Paul and Company, the Agent of the British India Steam Ad valorem on all imports, including transhipment cargo, and at the present time the Customs * work is being carried on for the Ruler of Bahrain by an Indian (Hindu) firm, a member of which acts as Director. Export duty of R?* 10/- per bundle of hides and R*.2/~ per bundle of dates is charged. very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from British firms in any part of the Empire. Such enquiries should be sent through the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trad©, London, or the Director General of Commercial Intelligence Calcutta, as may be more convenient. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is available in his records. SHIPPING &amp; COMMUNICATION. Shipping has continued to be ' 1 - 1 upset by the war, owing to so many British India and other Companye 1 ships having been taken off the run conse qiently the regular mail service had to be abandoned. A Hired Transport with mails has called here once a month from May 19 3?. only zr merchant vessels entered the port, as compared with 40 In 19 16- 17 and a normal number of 86. Calls have been made as follows Navigation Company,Ltd., is the only British firm. CUSTOMS . The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent EN 4JIRIES REGARDING TRADE.

The Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company,Ltd., 5 1 The Abad Line,Ltd., 3 1those articles were imported, in lieu of specie, which is strictly prohibited, in order to meet the demand of pearl merchants• EXPORTS . The total value of exports for the year tinder report amounted to £ 817,843 as against £ 779,943 in 13 38-17 showing an increase of £ 37,300 or 4.7b per cent. Export of specie has dropped by £ 320,594 or 95.88 per c«nt due to restrictions against the export of specie from India donse qaently specie in Bahrain which would ordinarily have been shipped to India, was utilised in purchase of pearls or horded here. %e decrease in pearls of 32.73 per cent is probably «*-as large qiantity of pearls were shipped by native craft to Bushire figures of which could not be obtained. The export of pearls would approximately amount to £ 4,00,000. There is also tendency on the part of the pearl merchants to under value pearls shipped by steamers in order to save in freight, apart from the fact that a large amount of pea.ls are carried personally by merchants returning to India. The slight increase of 7.50 per cent in general merchandise is mainly due to rise in value.

The export to the mainland has greatly iraplaved particularly in Rice, wheat, coffee, spices, sugar, tea, piece-goods and coir rope partly on account of improvement in the import of pearls and partly to better facilities for the prevention of smuggling into Persia. The issue of manifests for all cargo exported to Persia, and taking of deposits the eqiivaleno of the Persian Customs duties have deterred Persian boats from exporting merchandise direct from this port to Pernian coast ports where no Customs Officials are established.

Gopy to: The Givil Gommisaioner, Baghdad*INTRODUCTION . A general description of the physical, poli tical and comrercial peculiarities of the Islands is p-iven in the report for the year 1911-12 (Annual series No. 5052) The permanent population has sliphtly increased to 108,000. The local Customs Department does not maintain accurate e statistics, consequently trade figures h ve to he prep t^ed from from the manifests of steamers and country craft access to which has bean readily given by the courtesy of the Customs Director. The stiti^tios giver in this report are for the first time complete in as far as they go, as under a recent order the Ruler of Bahrain notified that all roods whether imported or Exported had to pass through the Customs House. This order has been carried out by all concerned and creditably supervised by the Customs Officials. Statistics regarding movement of pearls and specie are still very incomplete, as numbers of local and foreign pearl merchants make a practice of travelling to and from Bombay, carrying on their Journeys large quantities of pearls and specie in their luggage or on their person. The Shailch of Bahrain has, after some difficulty, consented to the establishment of a branch of the Eastern Bank Ltd in Bahrain. No branch has yet been opened owin&lt;* to the Government of India’s silver restrictions. Thv-result how-evei' ts that many lakhs of rupees are brought in every year by registered post, in the form of Indian currency notes of £.1,000 and £.500 / - It is quite impossible therefore to sive accurate figures for either the export of pearls or the import of silver. EFFECTS OF WAR . The severe restrictions imposed by the Government of India on the export of silver to Bahrain have hit the pearling fraternity very hard. The latter have been cormsILe to draw telegraphic orders (hundies) in consequence on local merchants for funds, at a loss of from R'. GQ/ - to R. 1J.o/- per R:. 1.000 /- during the season. The merchants who had lafce stocks / u/'i/y of goods from the previous year continued to import foodstuffs as much as they possibly oould, their ilea being to furnish d the3 the pe&gt;i.rl merchants with funds, from the sale nroceeds of these goods. They were successful in this until the embargo was placed in India on rice, wheat and flour at the end of iiovembar 1918. QPaNIHG FUrt BRITISH TRAP&amp; . The trade of Bahrain Islands is to a *reat extent in the hands of Hindu, Indian Muhammadan, and Persian merchants, who have had business connections with the Islands for ower a century and half, and far the greater portion of this trade of theirs is with India. The Mesopotamia Persia corporation Ltd (Late 'Iray, Paul oc Conoany) the arent of the British India Steam TTawi^ation Company Ltd., is the only British firm. CU3TJHS. The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent ’Ad ▼alorera’ on all imports with the exception of criminal bales cf piece-goods which pay a fixed charge of lv*lB^- per bale. A 5 ner oent tax is also levied on all car*’© landed whose eventual des tination is the mainland. Expert duty of tfUlo/- m#r bu^l of hides and ti.z/- per bundle of dates is charged. The customs work, is being carried on for the ’’uler of Bahrain by an Indian (Hindu) firm, a member of whio v acts an director. ENQUIRIES REGARDI HG TRADE . The Political Agent Bahrain and Mainland will be very wlad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom, through the Commer cial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the director General Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be save 1 by addressing the latter offioial direct, ae information on ost ordinary subjects is available in his records. SHIPPING . Shipping has continued to he very unsatisfactory and the trade of the oort has suffered proportionately, be regular mail service has been abandoned. A hired transport with mails and Government stores has called here onoe a month during the year. Qnly $5 vessels entered the port on the up voyage as compared with the normal number 8d, while 7 vessels called on the down voyage. Of these only 1 vessel belonred to the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company Ltd. Freights varied from £.5/- to £.5/- per ton from or to (Bombay or Karachi ) by5 , by steamer, and by country oraft £.1-10-0 to £.2-5-0 ner ton. _R^i-iKK3 on (l) The pearl trade atill dominates t&gt;ie whole co'neroial situation, and the movements of nearle and specie, though reacting on the movements of general merchandise, must be taken by themselvea. The table showing the total importi and exports under these heads for the year 1918-19 and the previous year are of interest.

Opening for British Trade, —The trade of Bahrain Islands is to a great extent in the hands of Hindu, Indian Muhammadan^ and Persian merchants, who have had business connections with the Islands for over a century and half, and far the greater portion of this trade of theirs is with India? The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited (late Gray, Paul and Company), the agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, is the only British firm. %. f &gt;/ {[. j r / t Customs. —The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent, ad valorem on all imports with the exception of original bales of piece-goods which pay a fixed charge of Rs. 15 per bale. A 5 per cent, tax is also levied on all cargo landed whose eventual destination is the mainland. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per bundle of dates is charged. The customs work is beim* carried on for the Ruler of Bahrain by an Indian (Hindu) firm, a member of which acts as Director. ^ Enquiries regarding trade. —The Political Agent, Bahrain and Mainland, will be very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom, through the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director- General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is available in his records. Shipping has continued to be very unsatisfactory and the trade of the port has suffered proportionately. The regular mail service has been abandoned. A hired transport wit^mails and Government stores has called here once a month during the year. Only&lt; 35 vessels entered the port on the up voyage as compared with the normal No. 86, while 7 vessels called on the down voyage. Of these only 1 vessel belonged to the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company, Limited. Freights varied from £3 to £5 per ton from or to (Bombay or Karachi) by steamer, and by country craft £1-10-0 to £2-5-0 pel ton. (1) General remarks on trade. —The pearl trade still dominate the whole commercial situation, and the movements of pearls and specie, though reacting on the movements of general merchandise, must be taken by themselves. The table showing the total import and exports under these heads for the year 1918-19 and the previous year are of interest. IMPORTS. ♦ Tear Specie. Pearls. Total of specie and pearls.

I he decrease is mainly in specie and pearls—the ionnt&gt;r is due as mentioned above to severe restrictions against export from India, while the letter is due partly to poor catch along the shores of the mainland of Arabia (the pearls whereof are brought to Bahrain |to be sold) and partly to non-declaration of import at the Customs. The slight increase of 4-40 per cent., in spite of general decrease in quantity, under general merchandise is solely due to continued high prices of all commodities during the year under report. Large quantities of China silk piece-goods (re-exported from India) have it is suspected been labelled as piece-goods in the manifests, in order to reduce the ad valorem duty buch have been valued in this report as “ piece-goods ” in the absence of correct information. The decrease in piece-goods is partly due to overstock of it in the previous year and partly to less import due to high prices ruling. (°) Exports. The total value of exports for the year under report amounted to £1,317,811 as against £817,248 in 1917-18, showing an increase ot £500,563 or 61*24 per cent. Export of specie has further dropped by £1,562 or 3*23 per cent, on account of restriction against the export of specie from India, consequently specie in Bahrain, which would ordinarily have been shipped to India, was hoarded here till the pearl season when it was used for the purchase of pearls. The increase under export of pearls amounts to £383,341 or 118T4 per cent, which is nearly ndrmal, as the decrease of the previous year was shown to have been due to large quantity of pearls bavins been shipped by native craft without value being declared at the Custom^ There is still a tendency on the part of some of the pearl merchants to under value their pearls shipped by steamers, in order to save in freight; also as mentioned above a large number of pearls are surreptitiously carried by special messengers who run down to Bombay during the season, and bring back specie on their vray up. The increase of 24-04 per cent, under general merchandise is mainly due to rise in value. ORIGIN OF IMPORTS. Country, 1917-18. 1918-19. Increase or decrease.

The large percentage of SO’? in the flow of imports from India is misleading, since the entire imports of hosiery, lamp ware, hardware cutlery, toys white shirtings (“ Siwalli ”) and crockery (including Arab coffee cups and Persian tea glasses) are imported from Japan in the first instance and are re-exported to Bahrain from India. The same may be said of silk goods from China all of which come vid Bombay Koughly two-thirds of the piece-goods, excluding white shirtings, are from Manchester and find their way here vid the Bombay market.

The slight increase in the variation of 12‘99 in the flow of trade between India and the neighbouring countries is due to increase in the export of pearls to India. Proportion of British and Indian Trade .—Excluding specie and pearls, the principal articles of import into Bahrain (other than fuel, cattle and other live-stock, etc., which are only of interest to merchants on the mainland of Arabia and Persia) are as follows :— Articles.

A general description of the physical,political, and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the report for the year 1911-12 ( Annual series Ho. 5052 ),also in the • Handbook of Arabia * Vol.I.( I.D. 112B ) prepared by the Admirality w ar Staff Intelligence Division 1917. The perman&amp;nt population has increased to about 115,000, thds increase being mainly among the foreign commercial community doing business in Manama.Tli© local Custom© Department Is run on very unbuelnesellkt lines and though there has been a narked Improvement In their work during the fcaet yer.r»lt still does not maintain anything like- accurate etatletlce, consequently trade figures have to be prepared from the manifests of steamers,and country craft,accesn to whir has been readily given by the coutteey of the local Customs Director The statistics given In thle repott are an Improvement on thoee of laet year (19 ID) as far as accuracy goes,as the order introduced by the Ruler of Bahrain,at the Instance of this Agency,last year that all goods whether Imported or exported should paes through the Customs house has had time to get understood. ***. This ordsr is being carried out by all concerned and Is creditably supervised by the Cuetome Officials. In epite of the above however the position in regard to the movement of pearls and specie Is very unsatisfactory. Hence accurate statistics under these heads are next to Impossible. I«rge numhere of local and foreign psarl merchants continue the practice of travelling to and from Bombay and Karachi,carrying large quantities of pearls and notes In their luggage or on their person. wouia Indeed appear to be no remedy so long as the steamship Companies charga the public for carrying pearls and specie. In my report for 19TB-19 I mentioned that the Shaikh of Bahrain had after much difficulty and opposition consented to the establishment of a Bank In Bahrain. For Information I am glad to report that thts has matarilited quit, recently,though subsequent to the period under report, and to day a branch of the Faetem Bari Ltd.hae Its office In the busiest quarter of Uanama.lt was openad on? v,th June 1990.To commence with,the Bank was greatly handicapped in Its work by the prohibition on the export of sliver from India.This prohibition -as removed by order of the Government of Indiafseptemb£ T9P0) and the position of the Bank at once became assured.At present most of the business is dons by the sale of drafts on india.But an Increasing number of percone are using the eank as a place to depo sit their eurplm cesh.For the present the Bank gives no Intreet on deposit, under arrangement with th. Ruler of Bahrain,Intre.t being looked upon ai» contrary to Muesalman law. #0 2. KFFECTS OF TUF WAR * During the last two years the s« Vk restrictions irapoeed by the Government of India on the export of silver fror. India hit the Bahrein pearling fratermty v^ry Ife bad hard* The latter were compelled to draw telegraphic orders ( bundles ) In consequence on local merchants for funds,at a loss from F' 60to I? 180/- per £* 1,000/- during the season. It is expected that things will be considerably eaeed during the 1920 season, mainly owing to the removal the embargo on eJlvni and to the foresight of the bant, which has provided itself with a considerable silver reserve with a view to supplying the Divert with their silver wants. Governnentrice policy still continues In force-that it to say Bahrain as well as other Gulf portc are given a definite rice ration for the year. During 1020 the ration was greatly increased, to the satisfaction of all concerned, but the intro duction of the tender system at Karachi has largely multifled the concession. At the present moment the Tender system Is chiefl responsible to keeping prices up * in Bahrain. Ae working now It m^ane that only rice from Karachi is alio ed to be exported tc the 3ulf,and no one is pensltted to export until he has purchased the right mt to do so. This right is obtained by merchants Mddir against each other for the right to export a bag of rice. At one period the tender rose to, I believe,! ll/- per bag of rice. Naturally the consumer has had to pay. The system has caused the greatest dissatisfaction in Bahrain. It is emestly hoped 1921 will see its final abolition. 0P EH Ilf OS FOR gaiTHH TRADE . The trade of Bahrain Islands and as a resultant the trade of falassa and Sejd, is to a great ax! extent in the hands of MIndus, Indian tfohanmedan,and Persian merchants, who have had business connections with Islands for over a century and a half,and v&amp;ffy far the greater port!of this trade is with India. The only British firm is the Ueeopotani Persia Corporation Limited ( late Grey Paul and Company &gt;. T n recent correspondence with the Director of Commercial Intelligenc Calcutta, 1 advocated the appointment of a Government Commercial ent in fahrain, whose prim«r v dut d ■' - —direct touch with English Houses and generally advice in tl. of trade etc. With the increasing importance of Bahrain as t (u*) dietriouting centre of central Arabian traded I think tfie ex ment well worth a trial. I might here remark that owing to the friction which has existed between the Ruler of central Arabia with gs his neighbours in the Hejaz nearly all trade that used to come into Bidtxxix Arabia via the west (Medina ete)now comes into his country via Bahraih and Koweit* Again as recently as 3 i 7 &gt;on c h^ ago Bin Saud ordered all his merchants of the province of Qaesim (central Arabia) to use Bahrain as their port instead of Roweit. It is unnecessary to go into details as to reasons etc. The fact remains that the trade of Bahrain is on the increase. 4. CUSTOMS. The tarrif is fixed by treaty at 5% advalorem on / s *6zcfi*£*+ t tt—“A' 4 *', all imports. By an order of the Government of India in June 1920 , s the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit for the mainland was reduced to 2# from 5% at which it formerly stood. Export duty of jf 1C/- per bundle of hides and F 5 2/- per basket of dated is char-^ed The Custom*s work is carrieu on for tbs Ruler of Bahrain by a Hindu firm, a member of which acts as Director. Owing to the lack of a shed on the landing pier goods get very damaged especially during the rains. It ie hoped during 1921 this defect would be remedied. 5 . ENQUIRIES REGARDING TRADE . The Political Agent,Bahrai n who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade iron merchants in the United Kingdom, through the Commercial Intelligence branch of the Board of frade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta* Tima wcv.ld probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, information on most ordinary subjects ie avalDable in hie records.

General Unlike the past three years, during the year under review there was a general fall in the import trade of the port, due chiefly to the diver sion of imports intended for the North of Persia, which in past years used to pass through this port, to the Basrah-Baghdad-Kermanshah route, and also due largely to the complete security of the Bushire-Shiraz trade route, the insecurity of which in past years had abnormally inflated the import trade of Mohammerah. VOLUME OF TRADE The Import and Export trade of the port and district during the year totalled £11,789,475 as compared with £11,433,441 in the previous year, an increase of 356,034 or 3*11 per cent. The total value of imports amounted to £3,645,427 as compared with £4,615,423 in 1918-19, a decrease of £969,996 or 21 per cent; and the value of exports stood at £8,144,048 as compared with £6,818,018 in 1918-19, an increase of £1,326,030 or 19'46 per cenL While almost the whole of the increase in the export trade is to be attributed to the ever- increasing output of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany's crude and refined kerosene oil and its pro ducts, the decrease in imports should have been j much larger for the reasons given in the opening I paragraph, had it not been for brisker trade condi- j tions prevailing in the latter half of the year under report, owing to better shipping conditions, which cnablod merchants to have goods shipped direct to Mohammerah from the United Kingdom, and thus avoid the expenditure of transhipment I at Bombay.Imposts—Y i-iuj.

FREIGHTS. Direct freights from and to the United King dom were available daring the latter half of the year under report, and this facility resulted in a large influx of United Kingdom goods, especially Manchester piece goods far in excess of the demand. Rates of freight on Import cavgo from Bombay were: — (а) On General Cargo— R From March to July 1919 80 per ton of 40 c. ft. and 20 cwts. From August to December 1919 60 ditto ditto.

The rates charged by other steamers chartered by a Persian firm in Bombay were :— Rs. 455 per chest to Japan in June and November 1919. Rs. 350 per chest in February 1920. Rs. 260 per chest to Hongkong in Febraary 1920. • RIVER FREIQETS.

Conditions affecting trade. The t. ade of the port of Bushire for the period under review shows an increase in the total volume of trade of very nearly £300,000 over that of last year, the whole of which was in exports, as the imports showed a decrease. The reason for the increase in exports is probably the greater security in Pars and on the Bushire- Shiraz mad owing to the presence of British Indian Troops at Shiraz and on the road through out the year. This factor greatly assisted trade, as did the fact that more shipping was available. The principal reason for the decrease in imports is* that very large amounts were imported in the two previous years to replenish stocks, and the market became overstocked. Trade was still hampered by shortage and excessive cost of European and American manufactured articles; excessive steamer freights ; shortage of, and high rate of hire of, transport animals. The Bushire- Borasjun Railway, originally a purely military line, was opened to civil traffic in May 1919, ^nd helped to quicken up trade to Shiraz, but it is too short to affect the situation very much. Volume of Trade. The total trade of the port of Bushire during the Persian year Qui-Il, corresponding to the period 21st March 1919 to 20th March 1920, amounted to £3,641,012 compared with £3,341,600 in 1918-19 and £3,260,130 in 1917- 18, an increase of 8'96 per cent, and 11‘68 per cent, respectively. Of this trade the imports amounted to £2,723,357, a decrease of £223,093 over the average of the two previous years, and the exports to £917,655 an increase of £522,505 over the average of the two previous years. The bulk of the imports was from India and the United Kingdom the former supplying 47’18 per cent, and the latter £6‘42 per cent, making a total of 736 percent, from the British Empire. This is a considerable falling off from last year when the British Empire supplied 93 per cent, of the imports, but this was only to be expected as a reversion to more normal conditions. The only other countries supplying more than 6 per cent, of th® import* were China and Egypt which sup plied 5 28 per cent, and 5*06 per cent, respectively. Of the exports India took the largest propor tion, 43 - 62 per cent, while the United kingdom took 6 64 per cent, totalling 60*26 per cent, for the British Empire. This is a considerable advance on last year when the British Empire only received 35*44 of the total exports. The places receiving the next large4 proportion of the exports are Hongkong with 18*19 percent. andSiguapor® with 10*62 per cent. Imports. The imports during 1919-20, as mentioned above, showed a decrease of £2*23,093—almost the whole decrease was from India, over £996,000 and from Dutch East Indies £3*2,000. Other countries showed increases headed by the United Kingdom with an increase of £239,000. By far the largest item of decrease in imports was tea the import of which declined by £280.281 on the average of the preceding two years; this more than accounted for the whole de crease in imports. The reason for it is not clear unless merchants were holding up in anticipation of a reduction of duty at the end of the v'ear. Possi bly also there was an increase of smuggling. Another large decrease was in the import of rice which fell to £62,657 ; this was due to the restrictions on the export of rice from India. A similar cause reduced the imports of flour by £ 82,634. The import of indigo decreased by some £55,000 and of apices by £ 23,271, but the reason for these decreases is not very clear unlessit is due to increase of smua'gling. Sugar also showed a large decline—£23,271. Tissues of wool also showed a considerable decline, this is proba bly due to the prohibitive cost of such tissues now. On the other hand the principal increases in imports are matches, over £13,000, wood for building over £8,000, loaf sugar over £36,000 drugs and medicines over £11,000, clothing over £14,000, Tin lead, zinc etc., in bars over £62,000 ; copper and nickel in bars over £21,000 ; cotton yarns over £77,000 ; Tissues of cotton over £78,000 ; Tissues not specified over £8,000 ; Mercery and Haberdashery over £25,000 ; China and earthenware over £14*,000 ; Glassware over £23,0()0 ; manufactured tobacco over £17,000. Most of these increases are due to the necessity for making good stocks which could not be replenished during the war. The increase in “ Tissues of Cotton ” appear to be due to increa sed price only, as about the usual quantity was imported. The reason for the large increases in Tin, Zinc, etc., and copper is not very clear unless it is due to the import of electric light and tele phone installations. Export. The export as mentioned above 'increased by £d22,50o. Of this the increase in exports to India amounted to almost £ 288,000 as compared with exports of 1918-19. Exports to the United States of America increased by nearly £18,000, to Japan by over £42,000, to Hongkong by over £134,000, and to Bahrein by £38,000. On the ! other hand exports to Singapore decreased bv over £41,000, to Mesopotamia by over £10,000 and to j Oman by over £12,0o0. The principal increases in exports were almond#, pistachios, etc., over £19,000, turn Tragacanth ; over £112,000, cotton raw over £14,000, carpets &gt; £ } 10.000, Tobacco unmanufactured over £55,000, i skins £12,000. The only considerable decrease was opium which, though showing an increase on 1918-19, declined by £66,000 on the average of the previous two years. CommuricatloD with Interior. Owing to the presence of British Indian Troops throughout the year the Bushire-Shiraa road was practically safe, and m'otor convoys went along it although parts were unfinished. The Bushire- Borasjun Railway was opened for civil traffic in May 1919, and helps to expedite cargo, though as mentioned above it is too short|to be of very much use. The safety of the road naturally assis ted trade. This combined with the improved state of Ears province undoubtedly helped the export trade a great deal. Rates of mule hire varied between £41 per ton in April and £15 per ton in October Rates for merchandise from Bushire to Borasjun was £1-13-0 per ton. Many of the muleteers are using the railway to carry the merchandise, which they have contracted to transport to Shiraz, as far as Borasjun, where it is transferred to mules. This is a great convenience to the muleteers as they can leave their mules at Borasjun instead of having to bring them to Bushire and then send them back to Borasjun on account of the lack of grazing at the former place. Exchange. The rates of sterling exchange varied from Krans 20‘69 to £1 in March 1920 to Krans 83 20 to £1 in August 1919, while rupee exchange varied from Krans 207*45= R100 in April 1919 to 292*85 Krans=S100 in August 1919. The average rates were Krans 28*83 = £1 Kran# 261-28 =R100. The rate at which statistics on this report have been calculated is Krans 26 to the pound. * Rainfall. The rainfall throughout Southern Persia in the cold weather of 1919-20 was good if rather late, and resulted in a good harvest in 1920, spoilt in many parts by locusts. The harvest of 1919 was not a good one. The rainfall at Bushire was 12T2 inches agai nst 8*06 inches the previous year and an average of 2*42 inches* Public health. There was no epidemic of plague or cholera in Bushire or South Persia during the year, nor was there any appreciable reorudence of influenza in epidemic form, though sporadic cases occurred. Freight. The rate for general cargo was R30 per ton. Throughout the greater part of the year practically all shipments to London were by transhipment in India; towards the end of the year some of the direct steamers from England recommenced run ning. The rates 'or the principal commodities were. Almonds and Pistachios . £ 7per ton of 17 cwt. Gum tragacanth . . £7-6-0 per ton 17 cwt. Carpets ....

General Remarks. - Ll 11 ^ nrr ' The tender system for export of rice from India ceased in 1922.lt had caused great satisfaction and was open to much abuse. Motor Cars have increased in the Island during 1920-22and there ar now some 40 ears, L outly of American makes,which are imported direct from America on a through ’Bill of Lading*,thus escaping customs in India.Any English firm of Light Car suppliers who xiklxkc would be enterprising enough to issue a circular in Arabic and Persian to the Gulf Ports might be well rewarded. The Director-General of Commercial Intelligence sent a number of samples from various Indian fims.of such articles as scap,hardware, cutl tinned fruits ,etc.These were exhibited to the public for a long period. It is doubtful whether any trade resulted.The principal reason may be x attributed to the very unsatisfactory way the articles were put up.The majority of the articles had no label attached to show address of suppli^ or price of the article.Tenas of business and prices were invariably ir&gt;M English# a hd typed on lists without any reference to the actual exhibit. in unlikely that intending Ar;/b or Persian customers would go to the km length of having the lists translated and then endeavouring to discover among the exhibits the articles to which each price referred. It is highly desirable that firms who exhibit samples should do A with due regard to the market for which the exhibits are made,as rega the language for written matter,andevery article should be clearly with prices, and name and address of the eupplier.Neglect of suoh ele' j precautions entirely jeopardises*** the prospects of suppliers.h?

Introduction. A general description of the physical, political, and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is oiven in the report for the year 1911-1 ~ (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population has increased to about 115,000, this increase being mainly among the foreign com mercial community doing business in Manamah. 2. Slump in Trade in 1920-21 and Partial Revival in 1921-22. As a result of the world-wide depression in trade, the pearl market was exceptionally dull in the year 1920-21. This, as is always the case in the Bahrain Islands, is at once reflected in the figures for the general trade of the Islands. Imports show a decrease in value of £U&gt;3,430 and Exports £533,273 compared with the year 1919-20; the latter figure being mainly due to a large decrease in the value of exports, mainly pearls. The decrease was actual since very few pearls were sold, though probably not so great as the figures would show owing to the fact that pearls are rarely exported on manifest and com plete records are therefore not available. A slight revival of trade occurred in the year 1921-22, imports showing an increase over 1921’- 21 of £201,096 and exports similarly an increase of £137,949 ; the latter figure again being due mainly to export of pearls to India. 3. Customs. The Tariff is fi xed by treaty at five per cent ad valorem on all imports. By an order of the Government of India in 1920 the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit for the mainland was reduced to two per cent, from five per cent, at which it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The customs work is carried on for the Ruler of Bahrain by a Hindu firm, a member of which acts as Director. Owing to the lack of a shed on the landing pier goods are often damaged especially during the rains. The Ruler has as yet taken no steps to remedy the defect. 4. Enquiries regarding trade. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be very glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade by merchants in the United Kingdom r through the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director-General of Com mercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is available in his records. 5. General remarks. The tender system for export of rice from India ceased in 1922. It had caused great dis satisfaction and was open to much abuse. The number of Motor Cars in the Island has increased during 1920-22 and there are now some forty ears, motly of American makes, which are imported direct from America on a through f Bill of Lading' thus escaping customs in India. Any English firm of Light Car2 suppliers who would be enterprising enough to issue a circular in Arabic and Persian to the Gulf Ports might be well rewarded. The Director-General of Commercial Intelli gence sent a number of samples from various Indian firms, of such articles as soap, hardware, cutlery, tinned fruits, etc. These were exhibited to the public for a long period. It is doubtful whether any trade resulted. The principal reason may be attributed to the very unsatis factory way the articles were put up. The majority of the articles had no label attached to show address of suppliers or price of the article. Terms of business and prices were invariably in English, and typed on lists without any reference to the actual exhibit. It is unlikely that intend ing Arab or Persian customers would go to the length of having the lists translated and then endeavouring to discover among the exhibits the articles to which each price referred. It is highly desirable that firms who exhibit samples should do so with due regard to the market for which the exhibits are made, as re gards the language for written matter, and every article should be clearly marked with prices, and name and address of the supplier. Neglect of such elementary precautions entirely jeopardises the prospects of suppliers. * % »TABLE C ” I—IMPORTS.

A general description of the physical, political, and the comm^ci&amp;l peculiarity of the Islands is given in the report for the year 1911-12 ( Annual Series Ho. 5052). The permanent population has increased to about 115,000, this increase being mainly among the foreign coionerGial community doing business in Xanaaah. 2 . RenT-ft3&gt;..9f XgftlU • The slight revival of trade which occulted in 1921-22 maybe said t© have continued generally during 1922-23 owing,ateusual, to the increased pearl trade. Imports shew an increae in value of £ iw^H*4^aad Ixports £ 309,574 compared with tht.'year 1921-22. Tne increase in value of Imports is mainly due to the movement of specie consequent on the improvement in the pearl market and to a certain extent to the heavy import .f America^oil.

The Exports show an increaee over 1921-22 af £ 309574 mainly due to the exort of pearls to India. The total value of £ 860589^ which is considerably below pre-war figures, compares favourably with those for previous years, but^as in imports, there has been a deorease amounting to 9.8 $er cent in the value of general merchandise exported as shown in the statement below:- Tear Specie Pearls 1921-22 HU 63393 1922-23 85534 334993 Increase or decifc&amp;be Kil per cent plus 528*4 per cent General Merchandise Total 487622 551016 440062 860589 minus ft* plus 56.2 per 9.8 per cent cent. This decrease is again mainly due te a fail in values and partly to decrease in the export of silk, wooilengoode,wheat and wheat flour. The decrease in value of wheat and wheat flour experts ie perhaps due to the fact that rains on the mainland in the early part of 1922 were exceptionally good resulting in good gracing and rain crops and consequent de creased importation of grains. On the other hand, the export figures ef dates te India and coffee to the mainland show considerable increases. One noteworthy feature during the period under review is the export of bother -of-Pearls to England and India to the value of £ 433 and £ 906 respectively. Exports of this commodity entirely eeased during the war although in pre-war years they were considerable. 3. Costuau The Tariff to fixed by treaty at 5 per cent ad-valorem on all imports.

Owing to the lack of a shed on the landing pier goods are often damaged especially during the rains. It is hoped that, under the Reforms recently introduced, the defect will be remedied early. 4 . Enquiries regarding Trade. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be very gladto answer any enquiries regarding trade by merchants in the United Kingdom, through the Commercial Intelligence branch of The Board of Trade. En quiries from India should be made through the Director-General, Commercial Intelligence Depart ment, Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary subjects is available in his records. 5. Shipping. There is a regular weekly and bi-weekly mail service from and to India. It may not be out of place to mention that, immediately after the period under review, as a result of the International Postal Conference held at Bushire and the consequent abolition of the British Post Office there, the practice of sending mails to India by up-steamers via Bushire has ceased. Thus the number of mails to India has been reduced from 6 to 2 a month. This, it is feared, will to a large extent adversely affect the trading community. 6 . General Remarks. Motor roads suitable for light cars exist between Manamah and Sukhair, a distance of 18 miles, and between Manamah and Budaiya, 12 miles. Besides about 40 private cars, motor vehicles now- ply for hire. As pointed out in last year’s report, any British firm of cheap light car suppliers who would be enterprising enough to issue a circular in Arabic and Persian might well be regarded. C. K.
