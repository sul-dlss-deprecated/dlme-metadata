(ii) The expenditure involved in locating the wreck, installing a dumb buoy on it, and later maintaining the buoy, is likely to be considerable, (iii) The arrangement might prove unreliable. 3, The Government of India suggest that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, should be requested to locate the wreck and, if there is no objection, he should be asked to blow it up with a depth charge or by any other means practicable. The Government of India would be glad to know in due course what action is being taken. The issue of the above has been authorised, (SGD,) GIRDHARI LAL. for Under Secretary to the Government of India. NPG.Copy of an express letter No. 13PGr/46 dated 28.11.46 from the Chairman, PGLS Advisory Committee, Bombay to the Asstt.Secretary to the Govt, of India, Commerce Dept., New Delhi, Reference enclosed copy of letter N o .12/ M -1/27 of the 7th instant with its enclosure from the Director Qereral of Ports and Navigation, Basrah regarding the location of a wreck at Manama, Bahrein in Persian Gulf. The proposal contained therein was circulated among the meiribers of the P.G.L.S^ Advisory Committee, Excepting Mr. Cope of the Anglo Iranian Oil Co., all were in fnvour of the PGLS locating the wreck and marking it by a buoy. Mr. Cope in his letter No.G/C/105 of the 25th instant (copy enclosed) considers that 'recks are no liability of the P.G.L.S. and suggests that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf should be approached to locate the wreck and if successful, blow it up. As it has already been established that surveys in Persian Gulf are not the liability of the P.G.L.S, vide correspondence ending with letter No.306-M-III(22) /44 dated 9-2-46 addressed to the Director General of Ports &amp; Navigation, Basrah by the Nautical Adviser to the Govt.of India, I agree with Mr. Cope. However, as the location of the xxsk wreck in question is essential for sale navigation of that area, I suggest that the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, be approached by you to make arrangements as early as possible to locate the wreck and bio* it up if possible. If it is stiil considered necessary to murk it by a buoy, the P.G.L.S. can have no difficulty to undertake the work. I may kindly be informed of the action taken by you.Copy of memo, N0.12/M-1/27 dated 7.11.46 from the Director General of Porta and Navigation, Basrah to Messrs Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., Bahrein, and copy to the Chairman. ith reference to your letter No. B1/S.656 of 9th Sept. 46, I am to state that I have no authority to establish a dumb buoy to mark the wreck near the est Spit Li^t Buoy at Bahrein and would advise you to take up this matter through your representative in Bombay ^ith the Chairman of the Persian Gulf Limiting Service Adv. Committee, c/o Dy. Supdt. of Lighthouses, Old Custom House Yard, Fort, Bombay, Copy to; The Chairman PGLS Adv. Committee, Bombay, with copy of letter under reference for information. It is stated that the wreck referred to is a wooden craft sunk some 25 years ago. As vessels of B.I.S.N.Coy. ani other concerns visiting Bahrein also call at Basra and pay light dues on crossing the Shatt-al-Arab Bar, and, as the Bahrein Govt, dies not collect light dues, the marking; or removal of the wreck, if still there, would appear to be a legitimate liability oi the PGLS. Copy of letter No.BI/3.656 dt. 9.9.46 from M/S Gray Mackenzie and Co. Ltd., Bahrein to the Director General of Ports and Navigation, Sasra. e shall be glad if you will pass on to tte proper authority an enquiry we have received from the Commander of a B.I.Vessel at this port to the effect that if possible, the wreck which is shown on the Chart near the Vest Spit Buoy at Manama, Bahrein, be located and marked by a Dumb buoy. At present, the presence of this wreck is shown by the Chart does not allow vessels to anchor as near the shore as possible, and if the wreck could be located, then, navigation could be made easier. Thanking you.Copy of letter No. G/C/105 dt. 25-11-45 from Mr. J.J.Cope c/o Anglo Iranian Oil Co., Bombay to the Secretary, PGLSAG, Bombay, port Director because the local Government Authorities in Bahrein who, it is understood, do not collect dues from shipping using that Port, were not prepared to take any action in the matter, T Vhilst I bive no objection to reasonable expenditure on essential aids to navigation being incurred by the Fund, it is pointed out that the wreck, being a wooden,craft sunk 25 years ago, its location at this distance of time is likely to be a matter of substantial expense if the intention is to employ 'Nearchu8 ,, , even if that vessel is now fitted with an Echo-Sounder, as to which confirmation might be obtained. 'recks are not the responsibility of the F.G.L.S., and in the absence of any Receiver of Wreck in the Gulf, it is felt reasonable that the Senior Naval Officer should be approached locally through the Political Resident, who resides in Bahrein, with a view to the wreck being located and, if successful, blown up by a depth charge, rather than that the Fund should incur the uncertain expense of the operation, as well as installing and maintaining a dumb-buoy, which might itself be an unreliable arrangement. The wreck is shown in 35 ft. of water and a survey of the area may prove that it has ceased to be a danger to navigation. ith reference to your circular letter of 20th inst (No.l3PG/46), it is assumed that reference «as made to the WRECK OFF BAHREINNo. C/247 Political Agency, Bahrain.

The Navigation Officer of the 'Wildgoose' came to see me tliis morning, and pointed out that whereas the wreck containing the bags of cement 1 entioned in your memorandum ^ Just quoted is (as mentioned in the enclosure to Residency Printed Letter ;o.918-S dated the 14th T r ay, 1947) to the south of the /Vest Spit Buoy, the wreck originally complained of by Gray 'ackenzie (vide Agency Endorsement lo.c/302) is to the North East. It would thus appear that there are now two wrecks for our consideration instead of one. The Naviga tion Officer also points out that to locate the position quoted by Gray Mackenzie, a chart and sextant (and some one to use them.') are required; that the operation is a small survey; that the Admiralty require a very high standard of evidence before they will take action to expunge wreck marks from charts; that, for example, they require the angles fixed to be cited before they accept a position: and that the Job is not one for native divers. /As the Phe lon'ble Lt-Gol.
