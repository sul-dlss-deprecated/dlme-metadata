Representative in Bagdad of the ±raq Petroleum Company has confirmed to me information received from other sources that company have decided to build a further pipe-line to Tripoli with an annual capacity of 5,000,000 tons and to increase the capacity of the existing line to Haifa from 2,000,000 to 5,000,000 tons. This decision, if fully carried I into effect, will mean that the export of oil from Iraq will be raised from slightly more than 4,000,000 to about i 8,000,000 tons per annum. I understand that according to information received by the Ministry of Finance from the Iraqi Minister in London construction of the new pipe-line is to begin by April 1st, 1940.jo . rfT&amp;wihfr' communiGation on this object, ileasc quote 1 ! — —- - — Jfr *&lt;• SJ toHq address —not to any person by name, butfto— ( l address —not Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Grace, London, \V&lt; ?&gt; ■ THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affai *s presents his compliments to vf^ I 3838 and, by direction of the Secretary oT State ; transmits herewith cop/^c^ of the under-mentioned paper.

I HAVE the honour to enclose a copy of the agreement signed between the Iraqi Government and the Iraq Petroleum Company on the 25th May, which formed the subject of my telegram No. 213 of the 26th May. 2. In addition to the provisions summarised in that telegram, the agreement (article 3) relieves the Iraq Petroleum Company of their obligation, under article 6 of their convention, to carry at least 50 per cent, of the capacity ot the whole pipe-line system to the Haifa terminal. I understand that Mr Skliros insisted on this amendment so that more oil could, when deemed expedient, e carried along the pipe-line to Tripoli as the cost of pumping it by this route is cheaper than by the Haifa route. n a u 3. The agreement does not become operative until it has been conhrmed by a special law to be promulgated not later than the 1st July next. 4. I am informed that, in letters exchanged at the time of signatuie, the Iraq Petroleum Company agree to advance to the Iraqi Government Li50,UUU (not £200,000 as stated in the telegram referred to above) on the 1st June trom the first £500,000 instalment of the loan of £3 million. -n v rvi c Mr. Skliros contends that the maximum saving to the .British uu Development Company by the reduction in the number of drilling rigs m operation from nine to three would be in the region of £175,000, which is half the cost of the present operations of the company and would represent nearly 6 per cent, interest on £3 million. The economy would, however, be operative for only seven years, at the end of which there would be no return on the loan As the maximum capacity of the pipe-line system only slightly surpasses 4 million tons (the total movement in 1938 was 4,138,216 tons, on which royalties to the value of £825,200 gold were paid), there is no hope of recovering an a PP^ cl ^ n p ^^^ the advance from royalties in excess of the stipulated figure of £800.000 (gold). In order to secure repayment the Iraq Petroleum Company will, therefore, be oblio-ed in due course to'build another pipe-line. They will, however, be able to take” this step at their own convenience, whereas if they had concluded an ao-reement—as they were on the point of doing—with the last Government just before they were ejected last December, they would have been committed to duplicate the existing pipe-line system within two years. This would have proved an embarrassing obligation m the light of the tension that has since developed in the international political situation. 6 As far as the Iraqi Government are concerned, the negotiations seem to have been concluded in the nick of time. The shortage of funds had become so desperately acute that the Minister of Finance had. I understand, been foiwid to draw on the revenues of the Municipalities of Bagdad Basra and Mosul, and was actuallv contemplating paying civil servants only 50 per cent, of then salarie for May in cash and giving them six months’ promissory notes for the^remaining 50 per cent There appear, therefore, to be some grounds foi Mr. Skin os s conviction that the Ministers of Defence (Taha Hashimi) and of Economics and Communications (Omar Nazmi) and the Rais of the Royal Diwan (Rashid A ) refused to associate themselves with the loan agreement because they hoped that the negotiations would fail and that the Government would in consequence, lie forced to resign owing to their failure to solve their financial difficulties . a new Government would have had to be formed, probably under the leadership of Taha Hashimi which would immediately have endeavoured to come to terms with the oil companies. I am informed by Mr. Skliros that, m order that the agreement Unnld he Strictly lecral. the Minister of Economics and Communications should have s.Sed it on behaif of the Iraqi Government. As he would not do so, the [630 f—1]9 Prime Minister signed instead in the presence of the entire Cabinet, the “competent Minister” witnessing his signature. Any legal deficiency will, however, be rectified by parliamentary approval. 7. The agreement, which has been well received in the local press, will provide the Government with the cash it so urgently needs to meet the overdue accounts of local railway contractors and to proceed with the construction of the Baiji-Mosul railway extension. Expenses in connexion with railway development will, it is believed, absorb nearly all, if not all, the advance of £1 million payable this year. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. BASIL NEWTON. Enclosure. A greement between the Government of Iraq and the Iraq Petroleum Company (Limited), B.O.D. Company (Limited), Basra Petroleum Company (Limited) on May 25, 1939. THIS agreement, made the 25th May, 1939, between his Excellency Sayed Nuri Said, Prime Minister of the Government of Iraq, on behalf of the said Government (hereinafter called “ the Government ”), of the first part, Iraq Petroleum Company (Limited), of City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, in the City of London, of the second part, and B.O.D. Company (Limited), of City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, in the City of London, of the third part, and Basra Petroleum Company (Limited), of City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, in the City of London, of the fourth part (the parties of the second, third and fourth parts being hereinafter called “the companies” and represented by their attorney, Mr. John Skliros). Whereas the parties hereto have agreed to add to, supersede and partially amend the conventions hereinafter defined in the manner hereinafter appearing; Now it is hereby agreed between the Government and the companies in the manner following :— Article 1. In this agreement the following expressions have the following meanings :— The relevant convention means, in the case of Iraq Petroleum Company (Limited), the convention made between the Government and that company, dated the 14th March, 1925, as amended by certain agreements and letters, dated the 24th March, 1931 (hereinafter together called “ I.P.C. Convention ”); in the case of B.O.D. Company (Limited), the convention made, and certain letters exchanged, between the Government and B.O.D.

Company (Limited), that is to say : With effect from the date of this agreement the company shall drill not less than 12,000 feet per annum until the commencement of regular export of oil, provided that any excess of drilling over the amount named herein shall be credited to the amount required subsequently to such drilling. If this obligation is not complied with, the B.O.D. Convention shall become entirely null and void. All drilling shall be efficient and workmanlike.(2) The period of seven and a half years mentioned in article 6 of the B.O.D. Convention shall be extended by seven years. Article 3. The following sentence shall be deleted from article 6 of I.P.C.

The total advance shall be recovered by the companies without interest by annual instalments on the 1st day of January of each year at a rate not exceeding 20 per cent, of the said total advance, but only by deductions from the aggregate of the payments due by way of royalty under the relevant conventions as and when and in so far as such payments exceed £800,000 (gold) in any year, and shall not be otherwise recoverable. (2) With effect as from the date of this agreement, up to and including the royalties accruing during the year 1946, the royalties payable by Iraq Petroleum Company (Limited) on the 1st day of January under the I.P.C.

RUSTAM HAIDAR, Minister of Finance.Copy. (E lo19/1079/93) No. 49/E. . British Embassy, Bagdad. 2nd February, 1939. My Lord ■With reference to the Eastern Department’s letter of the 13th December last (E 7136/103/93) regarding the Convention concluded between the Iraqi Gove -nment and the Basra Petroleum Company, Limited on the 29th July, 1938, I have the honour to enclose copies extracted from the Official Gazette of the English text of Lav/ Ko. 68 ratifying the Convention which is annexed thereto, together with letters exchanged between the Iraqi Government on the one hand and the Basra Petroleum Company and the Iraq petroleum Company on the other. 2. The law entered into force on the 30th November, 1938, the date of its publication in the Official Gazette (Artbic version)• 3. The Convention, which closely follows the lines of the British Oil Development Company agreement, is for a period of seventy-five years (Article 2). Exports of oil are to commence aeven-and-a-half years from the date of the agreement at a minimum rate of one million tons per year (Article 6). If the oil deposits in the concessionary area, which is defined as all territory not comprised in previous concessions (Article 3), prove to be comparable in extent and specification with the deposits now being exploited by the Iraq Petroleum Company, the annual minimum oil exports must be/ \ight Honourable, The Viscount Halifax, K • G. , G.C • 3 • I., G.C .1 .E ., • 9 etc., etc etcbe increased to two million tons (Article 12). 4. The Company will pay the Iraqi Government by way of dead rent (Article 10) the sum of £200,000 (gold) on the 1st of January each year starting in January 1939 until the commencement of regular exports, when the dead rent will cease as such and be replaced by minimum annual payments of £3300&gt;000 (gold) based on a royalty of four shillings per ton (Article 11 (3) (a).). 5. The royalty and production liabilities are conditional on the petroleum found being of merchantable quality (Article 12). This provision was not specifically included in the British Oil Development Convention but formed the subject of an exchange of letters. The new Convention also differs from that made with the British Oil Development Company in that the dead rent is fixed at .200,000 (gold) from the first payment whereas under the British Oil Development Corapanji's agreement it rose from £100,000 (gold) in the first year to the £200,000 (gold) maximum in the fifth# The Basra Petroleum Comapny, though they must start drilling operations within three years of the date of the Convention and drill a specified minimum footage each year (Article 5), are not under an obligation to eep a minimum of nine rigs working,a commitment which the British Oil Development Company are finding embarrassing. A further difference is found in the Basra Petroleum Company’s undertaking to pay £3,000 annually for the education and training of Iraqis in England (Article 31). 6# In letters exchanged between the Acting Minister of Economics and Communications and Mr. John &gt;kliros on behalf of the Iraq petroleum Company, the site of the Government refinery, which under Article 14 (2) of the agreement of the 24th i arch, 1931 that company have to build if so requested, is defined as M any place/place within a radius of three miles of K*2 pumping station near Baiji'. It is also established in the letters that the Government may, if they wish, construct the refinery themselves. I understand that they intend to adopt this course and that the Minister of Economics and Communications is on the point of writing to four United Kingdom firms and one Czecho-Glovakian firm specialising in such wopk, inviting them to submit proposals for building and equipping a refinery. The minimum cost is likely to be in the neighbourhood of £500,000. 7. According to Mr. Skliros the concession is in the nature of a gamble as far as oil probabilities are concerned. There are no obvious indications of oil-structures in the concessionary area, which covers 95,000 square miles, but it is unlikely that there should be a gap between the Iranian and the Saudi Arabian structures. 8.
