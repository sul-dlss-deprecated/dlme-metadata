The policy was proposed by the Government of India, and Lord Linlithgow, the Viceroy and Governor General of India, forwarded a copy of the policy to Arthur Edward Broadbent Parsons, the Acting Governor for the North West Frontier Province, who provided feedback which is contained in the file. The file also includes a handwritten note with an illegible signature, which criticises the language used in the draft of the policy.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of the North-West Frontier Province</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>North-West Frontier Province</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002b8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
