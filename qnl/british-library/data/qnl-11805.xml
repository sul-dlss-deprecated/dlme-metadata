The following brief sketch of the more salient features ReC(mt politic* of the political history of Persia during the past few years History of will help to explain the present situation in that country. By the beginning of the present century, the condition of Persia, which for some years had been giving cause for grave anxiety, had grown quite intolerable. The Shah, Muzaffar-ud-Dln, was entirely in the hands of a corrupt ring of courtiers, who were living on the spoils of the Government and country. He had parted with the trea sures inherited from his father and with most of the imperial and national domains. He had thus been obliged to have recourse to foreign loans, the proceeds of which he had spent in foreign travel or had lavished on his favourites. There was a yearly deficit and the debt of the country was growing daily. Disturbances broke out everywhere and the popular discontent was not appeased until the Shah, in August 1906, had signed a decree granting constitutional Government to the people. A Majlis or National Assembly of 162 representatives of all classes, elected by their peers, met in October of that year. A few days later Muzaffar-ud-Din died. The new Shah, Muhammad All, adopted a reactionary policy and made every endeavour to crush the Nationalist movement. Insurrections broke out in the principal cities and finally w L391GSB 1a in 1909 tlie Shah abdicated his throne, being succeeded by his son, Armad Mirza, a boy 12 years’ old. The ex-Shah retired to Russia, a pension being allowed him by the Persian Government. There was, hovfever, no improve ment in the state of Persia and fresh disturbances broke out everywhere, notably in Pars. During 1911-12-13 several attempts were made by the ex-Shah and his brother, Salar-ud-Douleh, to overthrow the existing Government. These all ended in failure. These disturbances, however, coupled with the attitude adopted by Russia, who by the end of 1913, had on one pretext and another sent some 14,000 troops into Northern Persia, had brought Persia to the verge of ruin. Her treasury was empty, she had no military forces available to suppress disorders or to collect revenue, and there was no strong public man to be found to direct efforts at reform. Most of her troubles Avere ascribed to Russia, which had con sistently thwarted every effort at reform ; but Great Britain also incurred much odium for connivance. During the Great War Turkish troops and German agents entered Persia in order to cause further difficulties for the British. Their efforts were unsuccessful, but they had the effect of still further increasing the difficulties of the Persian Government. An additional danger arose early in 1920 from the advance of the Bolsheviks to the borders of the old Tsarist Empire in Trans-Caucasia and Turkistan. Their arrival there was the signal for an attempt on their part to get their agents into Persia, and also for a violent anti-Persian campaign in the Bolshevik press. The general tenor of this campaign was that the Persians must organise a revolution and get rid of the Shah, and that, if they could not start a revolution for themselves, then the Bolsheviks would invade their country and do it for them. On the excuse of captur ing the Volunteer Caspian Fleet which was interned at Enzeli, the Bolsheviks in May, 1920 landed troops at that port, got into touch with Kuchik Khan and the local Persian revolutionaries, and commenced an advance on Tehran. The Persian forces, backed as they were at that time by Britishtroops, checked this advance, but were unable to drive out the Russians. Under the Anglo-Persian Agreement concluded in 1919, the British Government had offered to advance to Persia two million pounds sterling, and to reorganise her army and finances. A military commission and also a financial mission were sent to Tehran to make the preliminary re commendations for this reorganisation. The Persian Government, however, were from the start only hall- hearted about the Agreement, and had put obstacle after obstacle in the way of its ratification. Early in 1920 the Persian Government commenced to negotiate with the Bolsheviks primarily for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Persian soil, and ultimately in February concluded a treaty with them, by which the Bolsheviks agreed to recall their troops and to grant generous concessions to Persia in return for permission to have a Russian Legation at Tehran and Russian consulates in all the chief Persian towns. Shortly after the signature of this treaty Saiyid Zia-ud-Din with the help of the Persian Cossack Division overthrew the Government, and set to work to institute reforms of a sweeping nature, which included the reorganisation of the Persian army and finances under British advisers. While accepting as part of his policy the main principles of the Anglo-Persian Agreement, he denounced the Agreement itself, and ratified the Russian treaty. In May his honest attempt to set his co\intry s house in order was upset by jealousy and intrigue, and Saiyid Zia was forced to resign. His fall gave a handle to the newly-arrived Russian Minister and enabled him to start an anti-British campaign in the capital and to advance the Bolshevik cause in Northern Persia to the detriment of British prestige. The Cabinet which came into power after Saiyid Zia’s fall, came more and more under Russian influence, and at the present time Persia is being exploited by Russia owing to the inability of her weak and corrupt leaders to break the spell the Russian Minister has cast over them. The national finances fire chaotic, and the future contains little hope of any improvement, unless Persia can cut adrift from her present position, and obtain4 (a) P^rm*n Baluchistan. assistance both in money and expert advice from some country other than.Russia, to enable her to set about her own reconstruction. Persian Baluchistan.— Persia, held what is now known as Persian Baluchistan for less than ten years during the reign of Nadir Shah, and lost it during the anarchy that followed on the death of that monarch. After a hundred years of practical independence, during which some districts occasionally paid tribute to Kajat, I ersia re annexed parts of the country in 1849, but Goldsmid found no settled authority by the coast, and it was really his mission in 1872 that gave Persia a title to the boundaries that existed before her last abandonment. The Persian Government established a Governor at Bampur, but exercised little more than fitful supervision beyond the Bampur valley. Even this shadow of sovereignty was abandoned some years ago and for the last fourteen years Persian Baluchistan has to all intents and purposes been independent of Persia. The history of the country is one of intrigues and quarrels between petty Baluch Cl nets scrambling amongst themselves, with constantly shitting fortunes, for power. The following brief sketch of recent local politics, taken from a report by Major Tveyes, introduces the principal characters now appearing in Pprsinn Baluchistan politics. The only four families with any hereditary rights as territorial chiefs dating from the confused period before the last Persian occupation, when most of the country was loosely attached to Kalat, are the Bazurgzadas of Dizak and Sib, the Buledis of Geh and Qasrqand, the Lashars ot the hill country between Makran and Bampur and the Sherkhanzai Nahrufs, originally of Rudbar, who had held Bampur for two generations before the Persian occupation. The Persian occupation, which commenced in the late forties, put an end to their status as hereditary chiefs of territories. All forts and lands belonged theoretically to the Shah, while much of the land, specially in the Bampur valley, became actual Crown property, cultivated by people who were virtually slaves, the remainder being held as hereditary property, on payment of revenue, or as revenuefree 'rants, for the most part by the families of the former territorial chiefs. The Persian Governor gave out the revenue farm of each district at the Naoroz of each year, and this auction tmsi- ness has gone a long way to rum ^^^X^te a which the alien Government was unable to substitute a stable rule. Tn practice, the revenue farm, which carried with it in definite rights of hukumat, was generally given _ to die tfst capable member of the local family, which, m most cases, owned the greater part of the land. Tn this manner the Bazurgazadas always held Sib and Bi-vk and the Lashars their hill country, while the Buledia we matotoed in Qa»rqand and' Geh tUl rep aced m the latter place bv Hussain Khan, Sherkhanzai, father o Khan The Sherkhanzai Nahrui ran a more chequered Oripnallv at Budbar, they had taken Bampur from a ehief of Kavanl extraction. The second Sherkhanal to hold Bampiir, Muhammad Ah, w'as m power at the U of the Persian invasion. He opposed the Persians and was taken prisoner and sent to Tehran, where he was kept m confinement for some years. On his release he ^tem^d to regain Barapur, but was defeated and his sons, Chakai a Hussain Khan were taken as prisoners to Tehran. He himself died as a refugee in Minab, and his sons were allowed to return to Baluchistan. The elder, Chakar, settled in Fanuch and married a Buledi, while the young married another Buledi in Qasrqand and was given the farm of Geh over the heads of the local Buledi family. His son, Said Khan, after his death, continuously held the farm of Geh which included the ports and Bint. Said Khan inherited a small property in Qasrqand from his Buledi mother, and acquired some land by for Jf ltu £® Vj Geh, but the Bampur lands were escheated to the Shan. Said Khan also occasionally held the farm of Sarbaz. Towards the end of the Persian occupaBon M^ladad, Buledi, and Said Khan each, when holding Saibaz, put Bahrain Khan, Baranzal, in as their sub-farmer.r Another of Said Khan’s sub-farmers was Islam Khan, of the inferior Rais tribe, who owned some property in Bint. Said Khan put him into the farm of Bint and the smaller ports. In 1907, the Persian Governor, Wali Khan, threw up the Governorship and returned to Kerman. The kotwals of Fahreh and Bampur thereupon offered these two places to Bahram Khan and Said Khan, who promptly took posses sion and held their respective forts for about 3 years before any serious attempt was made to re-establish the Shah’s authority. Sardar Nasrat then led a force to Bampur, where Said Khan made submission, but Bahram declined to come to heel and repulsed Sardar Nasrat’s attack. But for Said Khan’s help few of the Persian force would have got back to Kerman. For his services Said Khan was given the title of Deputy Governor of Baluchistan. This was merely a device for saving the face of the Persian Government, and it was an empty honour for him, as he never exercised any more authority than he had done pre- viously. That is, he merely controlled the Bampur end of the Bampur valley, Qasrqand, Geh, Bint and the small ports, while Bahrain Khan, who had held on to Sarbaz and .bahreh, was becoming more powerful owing to his famiVs annexations in Dizak. -Islam Khan was now for a short time Said Khan’s right nd man, but he had become too rich and powerful for his subordinate position. He and Said Khan were three times Z a th % P ° 1I ^ t of hostilities, but each time that Said Khan be»an to raise a lashkar against him he came to terms and no actual breach had taken place before Said Khan died. In February m 6 , during the absence of Said Khan bv Sakl Kh- n ’ JT admitted int0 fort at Bampur Sh Persian oL r n e fT , and ^ 11 had squired the \ a f- an ,. lands irrigated by the Bampur river tte guMdkmUp S C J&gt; aud £anaUasm be &amp; an to spread eastwards from!Mn, y in 1 the ) the s of 3S to sses- fore lah’s pur, ined But lave Avas fhis sian ; he jre- [ of nail and ly’s ght his nes mn nd in, iur he er. ed id te tn Persian Baluchistan, culminating m some very serioui raiding into British Makran and in the vicinity of the East Persian line of communication, and later in the murders of two British officers. Operations were undertaken against the Damanis in the Sarhad, whilst a Mission under Map or Keyes marched through the eastern portion of Persian Bafuchistan and extracted an agreement from Bahrain Khan by which the Baranzais undertook to recognise the authority of the Persian Government and to accept the appointment of a Persian Governor in Baluchistan. In December 1916, Hussain Khan threw off the ^dian- ship of Islam Khan and recovered his fort of Geh. In 1917 Islam Khan Avas murdered. Persian Baluchistan had remained generally tranquil until August, 1921, when Bahram Khan died Bahram Khan had established himself as the one powerful factor among the various chiefs in the province, and his death is liable to have an unsettling effect upon the others, and to cause a recrudescence of raiding and inter-tribal quarrellmg. The following Ire details of military operations carried out in Persian Baluchistan since the beginning of this century. (1) In 1901-02 Mir Muhammad Umar, a Baluchi t'hief 901 - 02 , who had previously been giving considerable trouble, fled to Persian territory, collected a following of Persian tribesmen, and embarked on a course ^ or ^ e n r + de K prea o a ; tions. The Nazim of British Makran with 1,500 tribesmen attempted unavailingly to suppress him. The Persian Sar- tio of Bampur expressed his willingness to assist, but his efforts and indifferent troops and guns were powerless to capture three forts, held by the rebels near Dizak The British Political Agent at Kalat with an escort of 200 infantry and 10 sowars, arrived and succeeded in persuad ing some of the rebels to submit to the Sartip, but Mir Muhammad Umar remained at large and continued Ins depredations. The Persian Government willingly con sented to the co-operation of the British and I ersian troop in Persian Baluchistan during the cold weather of 1901-04for the purpose of suppressing him. The Persian Sartip of Bampur a^ain express.-d his willingness to assist. The Political Agent returned with an escort of 300 infantry, 50 cavalry, 20 sappers and 2 mountain guns, and found that the Nazim of British Makran had besieged the brother of Muhammad Umar in the fort at Nodiz, in Kej, for 53 days, but without result as they had no guns. The’ British escort after bombardment by the guns stormed the place. The whole garrison was either killed, wounded or captured. The forts of Irafshan and Magas in Persian U.i.uchi.stan were also taken, and the latter partly demo lished. Muhammad Umar fled to Afghanistan. An Anglo-Persian agreement was drawn up by which Persia bound herself to maintain a garrison in Irafshan to assist in keeping order. To secure peace still further the Makran Levy Corps was raised in 1904. It was com- manded by an Assistant Political Officer and consisted of Panj^i^* 117 ^ 203 Infantry with headquarters at Op»atioL «’1909 of 1906 [t heeame evident that the Operation*, 1009 . arms traffic in the Persian Gulf was assuming dangerous proportions. Masqat had developed into an entrepot for an extensive trade between Arabia, Persia and Afghanis tan. It was decided to bring the case before the Arms Con- C WR . Brussels early in 1908.

These arms were transported short distances inland to convenient depots whence they were removed as opportunity offered to Afghanistan, many of them eventually tiuding their way into the hands of the North-West Frontier tribesmen. A naval and military expedition was therefore organis ed to suppress this traffic and the following steps were taken :— (а) Four of His Majesty’s Cruisers were with other ships employed in patrolling the coast, launches, etc., being used for inshore work. (б) A landing force was embarked on board Royal Indian Marine ship Hordinge consisting of half a battalion of Indian infantry, two mountain guns and a section of Sappers and Miners for operations ashore when required from January to April. (c) A General Staff Officer was posted at Jask for intelligence work. (d) A wireless station was erected at Jask for com munication between the naval and military forces. (e) Jask and Charbar were put into a state of defence with 2 machine guns and garrisons of 135 and 115 men respectively. (f) Measures were taken for arresting arms traders proceeding to the Gulf via India. (g) i battalion of Indian infantry was stationed at Robat on the Sistan border. These measures were successful. Arms captured con fiscated, etc., amounted to:— Rifles :—12,409. Pistols :—217. AmmunitionRifle—2,138,620 rounds. Pistol—3,560 rounds. Several depots of arms were destroyed by naval and military landing parties.10 MakrSn Ex pedition, 1911, * Operations against UamSuIg, August, 1916. (3) During tbe spring of 1911 there were large numbers of Afghans in Persian Makran engaged in the anus traffic. The running of contraband cargo from Masqat was being carried on on a large scale, the profits of the sale to all concerned being very considerable. To check this recrudescence of activity a force consisting of 1 bat- ' talion of Indian infantry, 2 sections of mountain guns, tvnd 2 sections of Sappers and Miners was mobilised under Colonel Delamain, D.S.O., on March 29th. The Royal Indian Marine Ships Northbrook and Hardinge sailed from Bombay on April 7th. On April 10th the whole force together with a party of Marines from His Majesty’s Ship Highflyer disembarked at Galag on the Makran coast and was joined by the princi- pa* local Baluch Chiefs. The force advanced up the Rapch river to Barka Band. On April 16th Colonel Delamain with 90 men mounted on mules pushed on to Bint. The Afghans retreated northwards. The whole force re embarked on April 21st and on April 25th disembarked at Sink on the Biaban coast to capture some arms which had just been landed there for Barkat Khan, a local Baluch, who was assisting the Afghan arms traders. On April 28th the force attacked the Pushak defile which was held by about 160 followers of Barkat Khan. After a sharp encounter the enemy was driven off. Forty rifles and 4,000 rounds of ammunition were recovered out df the consignment landed at Sirik. The force was re- embarked on May 8th and returned to India. The moral effect of these operations was great. The Afghans were discouraged, and the local Baluch Chiefs understood the inadvisability of participating openly in the illicit arms- traffic. (4) As a result of the raiding activities of the Damanls in the direction of the British lines of communication in East Persia, in 1916, it was decided to undertake operations against them. On August 2nd General R. E. H.

The force arrived at Hush on August 2nd, Muzin on the 3rd and at Ab-i-Kahugan on the 4th. Water was only procurable in the beds of nullahs and camps were invari ably pitched there. Heavy rain on the 4th impeded the column, but owing to good staff work no damage of any appreciable extent was done. On August Gth the force marched to Gusht and camped at Kalag, one mile north of Gusht. On the 7th the column met Major Keyes and his Mission at Kalag. On August 8th the column left Kalag at 5 a.M. and made a very arduous march through the Saraghan defile which entailed very difficult picquetting of the heights throughout its length for some fifteen miles, many of these heights towering up right and left for well over 1,000 feet above the road. Much road-making had also to be done to enable the baggage to get through. The rear guard reached camp at 8-30 p.m. On August 13th the column arrived at Jalk, where terms were offered to the Gamshadzais. These terms were reject ed and on the 15th the force marched out of Jalk to Sinu- khan, about 11 miles, where it camped. On the night of August 15th-16th a march was made to Jalk with 2 com panies of Hazara Pioneers, one section of mountain guns and one M. G. Section for the purpose of surrounding Jalk and punishing the Gamshadzais. The fort of Jalk was surrounded at dawn, many Gamshadzal jugis were burnt, and 150 or so women and children and 5 prisoners cap tured, also 25 cattle and 25 donkeys. The women and children were released and the detachment left Jalk for Sinukhan. On the 17th the force marched to Chahokan, on the 18th to Sareghan and on the 19th to Gusht and again joined hands with Major Keyes’ column. On August 21st Khwash was reached. This expedition was very expedi tious in achieving its object and in finally restoring the tribesmen to a proper frame of mind.12 (t) Kerman. (e) Bandar Abbas. The column experienced Sfreat difficulty throughout its operations owing to the heat and lack oi w atei in a country where shade is non-existent. ' Kerman.—From the time of Alexander the Great to the end of the 18th century wave after wave of invasion both from east and west swept over Kerman. The continued changes of government resulting from these invasions has contributed largely towards engendering in the people of the province a feeling of independence, in spite of the fact that during the latter half of the 19th century Kerman attained in an era of peace to something of its former importance. In 1911 there were many rebellions in the province against European incursion but these were finally put down by the Governor. In 1912 the province was again disturbed owing to the forcible collection of revenue, but by the end of the year a more settled state of affairs had made its appearance. This has continued to the present day. Bandar Abbas.—Until the year 1856 Bandar Abbas, together with the islands of Qishm and Hormuz, which had up till then been held in farm by the rulers of Oman, was formally declared to belong to Persia. Its history has been uneventful except A&gt;r periodical raids on the town by the Baharlus from Ears.

Geography. (a) Persian Baluchistan. Persian Baluchistan is the generally accepted nomen clature of a huge tract of thinly-populated country lying along the eastern border’s of Persia, conterminous with British territory. Its greatest length, from Gwatar on the south to Kuh-i-Malik Siah on the north, is roughly 350 miles ; and its breadth, from Kuhak on the east to near Kalanzau on the west, is about 250 miles. Its southern boundary is the coast-line from about Kuh Mubarak to a point in Gwatar Bay (Long. 61 degrees 29 minutes E.). Thence the eastern boundary runs north and east along the watershed of the various ranges of hills to Kuhak, as laid down by Goldsmid’s Mission in 1871; then turning west along the main watershed of the Siahan range, it passes between Jalk and Ladgasht, and, following the course of the Talab river as far as Mirjawa, it branches off from there over the highest point of the Kacha Kuh to Kuh-i-Malik Siah. The western boundary runs from this latter place m a south-westerly direction and, leaving Kiih-i-Bazman to the east of the line, cuts through Chil-i- Nadir, and from thence passing Ramishk on the east and Ispand on the west, follows the eastern and southern boundaries of Bashakard and Blaban to the Persian Gulf. The province is divided into four administrative districts with very vaguely defined boundaries. These are :— 1. Persian Makran, embracing all the low-lying region from the coast to the watershed of the Lashar mountains. 2. Bampur, north of the Lashar range with Kerman on its west. 3. Dizak or Saravan to the east of Bampur and bordering British territory. Bonndariea, AdministntiT* Districts.4. Snvliad to the north of Dkak, with British Baluch istan on its east. (a) Makrdn .—Stretching inland from the coast as far as the watershed of the first important range of hills, lies the district of Makran, which includes a strip of country averaging some sixty miles in width from north to south, except on the west' where the Bashakard hills gradually approach close to the coast, and narrow the district of Jask to a width of less than twenty miles. For twenty miles from the coast there is a sandy plain traversed by several rivers, and often covered by tamarisk. Beyond j this plain lies a range of hills of which the average height appears to vary from 1,000 to 2,500 feet. This outer range is not straight or continuous, but nowhere does its distance from the sea much exceed 20 miles, while towards J its extremities, as well as in the centre between the Rapch and Geh rivers, it approaches with an elevation of 1,500 feet to within a few miles of the coast. It is ordinarily com posed of a light coloured clay, and is capped with sand stone. Behind this range are the rugged limestone ranges of the Lashar Kuh and the Kuh-i-Bampusht, which lie outside Makran, but whose crests form the watershed of the district. South of them all the water drains to tde sea, chiefly through the Nahang, Sarbaz, Kaju, Geh and Rapch rivers. Most of the rivers, except after rain, only run above ground in parts, and then flow underground. This has the advantage of saving loss by evaporation. The soil is good and the water-supply fair, while there is excellent camel grazing in parts. 1 The following are the chief villages of Makran:— (a) Geh, elevation 1,504 feet, is a large and important village, 115 miles from Bampur, 85£ miles from '• Chahbar, and the first place after leaving the coast which is sufficiently fertile and well-watered to supply anything. It consists of some 500 houses. There is a fort standing on a rocky15 ilucb- s far 3 , lies untry south, lually .ct of sventy ed by eyond aeight outer ies its wards lapch 0 feet com- sand- cliff, but it is more or less in ruins. Geh is the capital of the district of that name. (b) Bint, elevation 1,400 feet, a large village and Bint, su ^-district, is situated on the Bint, or Fanuch river, about 45 miles west of Geh. The district is hilly, traversed by small streams and on the whole fertile. The village stands in the centre of date groves and is overlooked by a square mud tort on a high steep hill, round which cluster some &lt;0 strongly constructed houses. The streets are steep, narrow and very filthy ; consequently the place is unhealthy. The population consists mostly of Baluchis with a certain number of slaves, and is said to number 2,000. They are supported mainly by their dates. Camels are numerous and big, but not enduring. Religion is of great importance here, as in other villages of the region, except among the nomadic part^of the population. The mullas represent themselves as Sunnis, but are in reality Sufis. 'es of utside istrict. chiefly rivers. above is has soil is cellent (c) Qasrqand elevation 1,770 feet, a large village Qm^d. with a fort and population of 1,880, mostly Baluchis. Around are extensive date groves and cultivation. The village is well supplied with water, fuel and grazing. Routes radiate in various directions. It is the capital of the dis trict of the same name. (d) Bahii Kalat, the capital of the district of Balm, Buha Kaiat. a village of 1,000 persons, 38 miles north of Gwatar. The local chief receives a subsidy from the Indo-European Telegraph Department, ortant (2) Bampur is bounded on the north by Narmashlr from tbe west by Rudbar, on the south by Bashakard and amP r * ,g the Juakran, and on the east by the Paskuh and Magas sub- atered districts of Dizak. On the north lies the Jiibal Barlz range B 500 ^mle to the south are the Bashakard hills and the Lashar rocky which to the south forms the watershed of Makran.16 Hamper. Fahrflj. Sink. Between these ranges lies the Bampur plain with a general average elevation of 1,900 feet. A large proportion of this plain appears to be a sandy desert with heavy rolling ridges of sand stretching in many places right up to the foot of the hills. In the centre of the plam on its western side stretches the Jaz Miirian Hamiin, which absorbs the waters of the Halil Hud from the west, and of the Bampur river from the east, as well as those of the streams which flow down from the mountains to north and south. Along the river Bampur and its tributaries, however, is a fertile and thickly wooded strip of country, which alone provides a change from the sand of the remainder of the plam. The 'only places of importance in the Bampur district are :— (a) Bampur, elevation 1,906 feet, a small decayed place, no longer the capital of the district, since Fehruj rose in importance. It is now only note worthy because many routes converge there. (6) Fehruj, or Fahreh, or Pehura, about 17 miles east of Barapur, the present capital of the dis trict. It owes its existence to the fort built there in 1892. This fort is in a good state_ of repair but is not a place of any strength, being merely Ji fortified caravanserai, about 80 yards long by 80 broad, with seven towers. It contains a store room, workshops, stables and quarters. The town has a population of 12—15,000. (3) Dizak, or Saravan, lies between Bampur and the British border, with Sarhad to the north and Makran to the south. It is a highland district, cut up by high and disconnected mountain ranges, chief of wdiich is the Bampusht Kuh to the south-east. Across the centre there runs from west to east the Mashkil river. Parts of the district are considered among the most fertile in Persian Baluchistan. ' t The most important places are :— \ '• Ha) Dizak, a fort, which gives its name to the sur rounding district, and the chief of which is SI lin Its pr.

It lies in a valley about 50 miles long by ten wide, watered b_\ \ arious tributaries of the Mashkil river, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet. The valley, with those of Sib and Magas, enjoys a great reputa tion for fertility. (b) Sib, elevation 3,650 feet, a town of some 1,500 Sib. families situated on the banks of the Ruhtak river, a tributary of the Mashkil, which has a perennial now of water. It is surrounded by considerable cultivatian and date groves, and supplies are usually procurable. The Sib valley is about 8 miles broad. Ihe fort is a strong mud structure, Avell protected by tiers of habitations, all arranged for defence, and usually provisioned ready for a siege. The citadel stands about 60 feet high and contains a well. It has the reputation of being one of the strongest forts in Persian Baluchistan, an f’ owin £ to the nature of the ground, would be a difficult one to shell at close range. ^ &lt;I fr~ The .i Sarba L d is bounded on the north by Sarh.J. Sistan and the southern boundary of Afghanistan on a line running from Dehaneh Baghi to Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Its western boundary marches with that of Kerman running roughly north and south past NasraUbad Sipi, Gurg and Shurab. From Shfirfib it turns east and follows the northern borders of Bampur and Bmak and pass^g just Horth of Ja lk , reaches the border of British Baluchistan, which forms its eastern frontier. uiTind WH Ed iS p E mOUntaino 1 us tract - intersected bv high 1 land v alleys of an average height of 4,000 to 5,000 feet axne sea-level, with a steady downward slope to the south In general aspect it is identical with the wild barren' scenery of Baluchistan, and like Baluchistan it suffers from sunnlv n°f ''I c Wat6r - There is however a considerable to mike f n SUb 1 Urf f 6 1 Wat ? r ’ which would render it possible ilcT ^ i moderate development in agriculture, and with namb^of 81 ^ f ^ f c ? nsiderabl e increase in the f iloc^s for which the country could provide L391GSB 318 grazing. The chief feature of the district is the Kuh-i- Taftan, situated in the very centre. Otherwise the country gives the appearance of a waterless waste, with plains or valleys devoid of all trees and with nothing to rest the eye from the glare and the endless brown burnt-up soil. Dust devils are continuously forming and adding to the discomfort. The drainage from the Ivuh-i-Taftan, however, renders some parts less desolate. On the north the drainage on its w r ay to join the Mirjawa river has to pass through the Ladis valley, and this is well-teupplied with water and capable of much development. It lies at a height of 3,500—4,000 feet and has a good climate, but the population is, sparse. At present its water is made but little use of, except for the requirements of the railway. To the south the fall is by no means as rapid as in the case of the Ladie valley, and the highlands in this direction average about 4,500 feet, sloping due south. The main valley, that of Khwash, is over 30 miles in length and runs in a south south-easterly direction. Though it is stony at its northern end, it gradually becomes soft and sandy as it approaches Khwash fort. Prom this point a region of karezes and exceptionally fertile sandy loam is reached which continues to improve as one goes south. There is little doubt that this valley was once very fertile, but Daman! control has turned it into a desert with only a few patches of cultiva tion. The population of the Sarhad is in reality entirely nomadic, living in tents, and moving about according to the suitability of the pasturage for their flocks. All their grain is imported either from Sistan or from Narmashir. There are however some places which o^ing to their water- supply have always a number of tents pitched in them. J Da The most important places in the Sarhad are :— Oei kwStih. (a) Khwdsh, elevation about 4,500 feet, is one of the places which have most possibilities for develop ment owing to its well-watered and fertile soil. It possesses an imposing looking fort of no greatage, which in reality is not a very strong defence. It is rhomboidal in shape, 75 yards from north to south and 95 from east to west. The walls are thin and are built of rammed mud 20 feet high. There is a tower at each corner with a staircase up it. There are no banquettes round the walls and the fort is unarmed. In the centre of the north wall is the main gate, and there is a sm all private gate leading to a neglected garden on the south face. The interior resembles a serai ; many of the godowns and offices are crumbling away owing to the sandy nature of the earth with which they are built. The place is most insanitary. (6) Diisddp, a small oasis lying at a height of 4,500 Durdap. feet, which has risen into importance through becoming the rail-head of the line from Quetta. There is a Persian Customs post and a post and telegraph office. A small colony of Sikhs are to be found here. (c) Gusht, elevation 4,800 feet, is 60 miles south of Guuht. Khwash on the southern border of the Sarhad. It has a strong mud fort, which is of considerable strategic value in any operations against the Damarns, whose stronghold lies in the mountains to the north, by reason of the fact that it com mands the entrance to the valley separating two mountain rangefe, and in the hands of an indi vidual hostile to the invading force would cause delay to operations in which rapidity of move ment is essential to success. The present chief, Jalal Khan, rendered every assistance to General Dyer in the Damani operations of 1916. Rivers .—Of the rivers of Makran the chief are (a) the Rirer*. Dashtidri Chil, which enters the sea at Gwatar, (6) the Geh, which, flowing down from the Geh district, reaches the sea about 30 miles west of Chahbar, (c) the Rdpch, which has two mouths in the vicinity of Galag, and (d) the Sadaich, which flows into the sea 65 miles east of Jask. Of all these it may be said that they rise in the hills to the20 Ukcs. Moaotains, north of Makran and flow in a general southeidy direction towards the sea. They are not navigable and only after heavy rain do they possess any considerable volume of water. Usually they are fordable almost everywhere, and in the hot weather they nearly dry up, so that the main caravan routes run along their courses. The Dashtiari Chil is the name given to the combined streams of the Xahang, Sarbaz and Kaju rivers. The only river of any military importance is the Rapch, known in its upper reaches as the Bint or Fanuch, which enters the sea by two mouths, 9 miles apart, the western at Khur Rapch, and the eastern at Khur Galag (See under Harboicrs— Gulag). Both estuaries have shallow bars with deep water inside. Khur Rapch is the more considerable by reason of its large tidal breakwater, and would be a better landing place in rough weather, but the bar at both places has silted up, and it is doubtful to what extent it can be used even by small boats except at high tide. Like the rivers of Makran, the Bampur and Mashkil rivers in Bampur and Dizak districts respectively have but little water in them except after heavy rain, when alone they would offer any military obstacle.' Properly speaking, there are no lakes in Persian Baluchistan. T he northern drainage of the Lashar hills and that of the Bampur river, with its tributaries, runs into the Jaz Murian Plamun, which also receives the Halil R^d and other minor streams. This hamun, though of considerable extent during the rainy season, almost dries np during the summer months, all its water being lost &gt;\ e\ aporation. 1 o the west of Khwash is another small hartmn of no importance, the jChah-i-Gabl Hamun, vdnch is similarly generally dry. The Mashkil Hamun in British territory absorbs the Mashkil, Talab, Kalaghan and Jalk rivers. The other numerous water courses and nalas with which the country is covered seldom have any running water in them, though it can, in most paces, be found by digging in their beds, the water level being about 4 feet below the surface. The Kuh-i-Taftan or Chehil-Tan which is 12,681 feet a^ove sea level, is a volcano in the Solfatara range situ; the of f T1 wine two othe T1 and T1 and TI T1 are &lt; and is di Th west to 1( To Mor] pron snow To tl are i nous the v are Angi W Sarh wine) barn and i So rang the |21 ection after tie of md in main htiari f the [' any ipper &gt;a by a pch, Mrs— ivater lason iding ; has used slikil have when rsian hills runs [lalil h of dries lost imall nun, shkil ilab, ater- dom nost level feet iuge situated in the Sarhad district and about the centre of the plateau having a south south-west strike. It consists of four cone shaped peaks :—- The Madar Kuh, an active volcano 13,400 feet high, which gives forth rich sulphur and salammoniae. It has two large volcanic holes from which smoke issues. Several other parasitic volcanoes are seen along the slopes. The Nair or Nar Kuh to the west of the Madar Kuh' and separated from it by a narrow valley. The Ziarat Kuh to the north, shadowing the Madar Kuh and separated from it by a narrow valley. The Subh Kuh. The sides of the Kuh-i-Taftan for the last 1,500 feet are composed almost entirely of disintegrated pumice stone and beds of sulphur. It is to this and not to snow, that is due its conspicuous white appearance. The range continues altogether for some 50 miles to the west of the main mountain, at heights varying from 7,000 to 10,000 feet. To the east from north to south are the high Bugsar, Morpish and Gili Kuh rangeh. Behind these again is the prominent Safid Kuh range. All these ranges, which are snow-capped in winter, attain a height of 9—10,000 feet. To the south and south-west on the southern Sarhad border are isolated ranges of less importance, the most conspic uous landmarks being Hinjarak, Astahru and Margok. In the vicinity of Khwash itself the two most notable features are the sugar-loaf hill known as Kulhor and the Panch Angusht range on the south and west respectively. West of the Kfih-i-Taftan along the western edge of the Sarhad is the long range of the PIr-i-Shoran (Siahband) which runs north and south, and acts as a formidable bar rier between Sarhad on the cast and the Kerman desert and the Dasht-i-Lut on the west and north-west. South of this range lie a group of smaller and isolated ranges, the Gwarkuh hills, the lofty Kuh-i-Murghak, and the peaks of Malan Kuh and Hashal.22 Harbours. Jlsk. \ The Kuhi-i-Birg, which runs north-west from Magas to the southern border of the Sarhad, is a rugged limestone range rising to a height of 4,000 feet, which forms a prominent dividing line between Bampur and Dizak. South-west of this and forming the southern boundary of the Bampur plain lies the Lashar Kuh. East of the Lashar Kuh in the south-east corner of Dizak lies the Kuh-i-Bampusht, which forms the boundary between that district and Makran. It rises to a height of 5 ; 000 feet above sea level, and 2,000 feet above the surround ing country. The range consists of a series of parallel ridges of shale and sandstone, which are apparently more precipitous on their southern than on their northern sides. The principal harbours along the ( coast-line are Jask, Chahbar, Tiz, Gwatar and Galag.— Jdsk .—There are two anchorages at this place, east and west respectively, of the promontory on which stands the telegraph station. Large ships usually anchor in the west bay, miles from the shore, as landing in small boats is more convenient there. During a strong shamal (which generally blows from the west at Jask) they anchor in the east bay, half a mile from the shore and a mile from the telegraph station, as landing in the west bay then becomes dangerous. The promontory is low-lying, and the beach sandy and shelving. Low cliffs only exist in places. A small light house erected in 1920 is situated on the promontory in front of the Telegraph buildings. It shows a group flashing light visible seven miles at sea. It is looked after by the Telegraph Department. Tides never run strongly enough to- interfere with land ing in boats. The rise and fall is 9 feet and there are no dangerous currents. Pilots are not needed, but there are shoals in the approach to the west anchorage. Troops could be landed in fine weather anywhere along the open sandy beach, which forms the foreshore. Transports of the B. I. type could come within one or two miles of tht tel: dai owi strc are fro- 1 Tin the I is a mi]&lt; san usei bea cree ent&lt; T con; OCCf littl wad T A whr be not; A 2 h wal thic eve; wal eve: fro; Per 1 by situ23 as to jstone ms a udary er of idary ;lit of ■ound- irallel more sides.

Landing in the west bay would be dangerous -with strong north-west to south-west winds, owing to the surf. At times these winds even cause a strong swell to set round the point into the east bay. They are generally strongest in the afternoon, and common from October to Mai’ch. The only native craft available are a few baghelas. There are six ranging from 18-28 tons burthen belonging to the port. Landing by boat .—About 2 miles of shore in either bay is available, but the usual place is in the west bay, lialf a mile from the head of the promontory. Here the beach is sandy and shelving. When the shamal blows the east bay is used ; here the transports can approach nearer, but the beach is steeper, and not so convenient. There is a small creek 3 miles to the north of the station which can only be entered by small boats at high water. There are no wharfs and no available material for their construction. Apart from the small quantities of storea occasionally landed for the use of the telegraph station, very little merchandise is landed. Cattle, horses and camels wade ashore out of boats. There are no landing appliances. About one dozen coolies could be found for work as wharf and lightermen, and three times that number could be obtained from the neighbourhood with a fortnight’s notice. An old square Persian fort contains 24 small rooms and 2 large rooms in a fair state of preservation. The outer walls measure some 180 feet by 15 feet high and 2 feet thick, made of roughly fitted limestone. The mortar, how ever, is in many places in a very delapidated state, and the walls would need a certain amount of sand bagging to be everywhere bullet-proof. The fort is situated 50 yards from the landing place. It is at present occupied by the Persian Mudir of Customs. The telegraph building contains 18 large rooms (32 feet by 15 feet) and six smaller rooms (32 feet by 8 feet), and is situated 250 yards from the shore and some 400 yards 'iu from the landing place. The sepoys’ ban-acks have accom modation for 2 I. Os. and 100 men. There is also a guard room and a small hospital. There is a separate build ing sufficient for British officers. Electric light is laid on* in all these buildings, and fans are installed in the Hospital hut and officers’ quarters. There is a suitable ground 30 acres or so in size for park- ino- and camping convoys just east of the telegraph station. The soil is hard except’ after rain. Grazing is not procur able for many miles. The telegraph station is an important one on the Persian Gulf section of I. E. T. Department and is also in com munication with Masqat. The cable leaves the shore south east of the Telegraph buildings, and on account of this there is a prohibited anchorage which is marked on charts. Vessels should not anchor to the westward of the line beacon near Cable House on with ‘ Telegraph flag staff (N. 71 W. Mag.) or eastward of the line beacon on with conspicuous tree (N. 44-E. Mag.) A small beacon denotes the spot where the cable enters the sea. The statf consists of an European Superintendent and 10-12 European clerks and an Assistant Surgeon. There is a British ] 5 pst office of the Indian Government Postal Department in charge of a clerk of the Telegraph Department; also a Persian post office in charge of the Customs official. The inhabitants speak mostly Makrani, a Baluch dialect, and a little Persian. An interpreter is attached to the garrison; most of the Telegraph servants are also capa ble of acting as interpreters. Water is procurable, in small quantities and slightly brackish, from wells outside the telegraph compound. There are three tanks inside the compound, in which rain water is caught for the use of the staff. To obtain an adequate supply a condensing ship or plant ashore -would be necessary. A well belonging to the Telegraph Department, from which small supplies of brackish water are obtainable, is situated some three quarters of a mile north of the station. A well for the use of the garrison has recently been dug aloi gro wtu pip on tan in Tel par Go&lt; one fro ver To ing r J the snii to vill rui fro r hoi son Ba An wit po; the tin mo 15( r me of of sid tin:25 ) a Id- aid the rk- ion. ur- ;ian )m- ith- thia its. line taff nth &gt;tes ists rks lice rge nan ect, the pa rtly nd. a in an uld •ora , is ion. lug alongside that of the Telegraphs, and is connected under ground with it. The water is raised to a tank by a Persian wheel, whence it flows to the station by an underground pipe. The supply of tliis water depends almost entirely on the rainfall of the preceding year. There are three tanks, each holding 82,700 gallons, inside the compound, in which rainwater is stored. Two are for the use of the Telegraph stuff, and one for the garrison. (Sepoys ap parently prefer the slightly brackish water of the well.) Good water, sufficient for a force of 200 men for about one week, is obtainable from wells a mile and a quarter from the station. All the wells in the neighbourhood are very quickly exhausted, but fill up again in a few hours. To obtain an adequate supply for a large force, a condens ing ship or plant would be necessary. The ground occupied by the Telegraph buildings and the barracks of the garrison forms the extreme end of a small promontory, and is a concession from the Persian to the British Government. The old Persian fort and the village of New Jask are outside the boundary line, which runs from bay to bay at a distance of some 450 yards from the point. The Persian village consists of some 28 small stone houses and 75 reed ones. The population, which numbers some 400 souls, is a mixed one, consisting mostly of Baluchis and others, including a few Sidis, or negroes. An undisciplined rabble about 500 strong, mostly armed with Martini rifles, but of whom perhaps 80 to 100 would possess modern magazine rifles, could be got together from the surrounding parts. Ammunition however at the present time is scarce. It is doubtful if for each Martini there is more than 50 to 60 rounds, and for the magazine rifles 150 to 200. Such a force would have little fighting value. The only Persian officials belong to the Customs Depart ment. Jask telegraph station has been placed in a proper state of defence. The old Persian fort is situated on the flank of the line of march of an enemy attacking from the land side. During a threatened Afghan attack in April 1908 this fort was occupied by a naval force and a gun. Atrench was run across the promontory about 250 yards in advance of the telegraph station and manned by the Indian infantry guard. There is now a wired-in picquet line constructed across the promontory some 1,000 yards in front of the Telegraph station and enclosing the Persian village and fort. This line is held by picquets of the Indian infantry garrison. Gunboats in the east and west bays can command prac tically the whole ground in front of this position. The garrison at present consists of one Indian Officer and one platoon of the Indian infantry regiment garrisoning the Gulf Ports. The slope of the shore on the east side of the promontory would afford cover from the west to a small force advancing along the beach with the intention of enfilading the defences ; but it would come under the fire of a gun-boat in the east anchorage. Extremes of heat and cold are common, and in summer the moist atmosphere renders the heat very trying. Sand- * storms are frequent, and malarial fever prevalent in the cold weather. Normal rainfall about inches. The actual temperature during the summer is not ex cessive, the average being 96 during the hottest months (June, July and August), but the moist atmosphere renders the heat very trying. The average winter temperature is 72, . Jask village proper, now known as Juna (or Old J&amp;sk) is some 10 miles distant by land to the north of New Jask, where the Telegraph station is situated. The village con sists of some 60 mud and stone huts and a similar number of reed ones._ The inhabitants number about 500, com- pose of Baluchis with a few Sldls, or negroes, who are engaged in fishing and agriculture. Old Jask is the start ing point for the interior. The Khan of the district, Mir Mustaph?i, resides here. cnanbar .—The -— ancnorage at Lhahbar is exposed to the monsoon which blows here from the south, and is dangerous , 8eas ^- A lar £ e number of ships drawing to 20 leet could anchor in calm weather about 2 ™ilp-a27 i in dan ’OSS iph ’his &gt;on. •ac- rhe one the ory ing the in the id- * old ex- ths ers 72. »k) sk, m- oer m- ire rt- ict, the ms ng leg from the beach. The distance round the bay by land to Chahbar is 28 miles. But during the monsoon there is a heavy swell here. Large ships must anchor more than a mile out. There is no bar at the entrance to Chahbar bay, and it is passable with all winds. The five-fathom line is distant about two miles from Chahbiir beach. The coast south of the promontory on which Chahbar is situated is rocky and consists of cliffs 10 feet to 50 feet high. North of the promontory is a sandy beach, varying in^breadth from 10 yards at the point to 50 yards opposite the village. The water north of the promontory is shallow, except for a distance of 800 yards opposite the village, where boats drawing G feet can approach to within 20 yards of the shore even at low tide. The surf on the beach is not serious during the monsoon, and small boats can land without much difficulty. Lightering of heavy cargo from steam ships during the monsoon is impossible. No current exists. The rise and fall of the tide is about 9 feet. Pilots are not required. A fixed white light is exhibited at 10 feet above high water mark from the roof of the Telegraph office. This is visible from a distance of about 5 miles. About 20 boats carrying 20 men each are available here and at Tlz; also 20 canoes capable of carrying 4 to 6 men. There are about 20 baghelas, drawing 7 feet to 9 feet, capable of carrying 100 men each. During the worst months of the monsoon (June, July and August) practically all of these baghelas are taken away and beached at Gwatar, Gaobandl, etc., and shipping is at a standstill. For landing troops, etc., by boat the facilities are only the 800 yards of beach opposite the village. There are no appliances, but stone can be quarried about 800 yards west of the telegraph buildings suitable for the construc tion of landing places. ■ Chahbar is the most important port commercially on the Makran coast, being the chief importing centre for the28 interior of the district, as well as for the smaller ports between Jask and Gwatar. It is roughly square in shape, the sides being some 500 yards in length, and consists mostly of mud-built houses with a few of stone. The south-west side of the town lies parallel and approaches to within 10-20 yards of the shore. The Telegraph station, a substantial stone building, is situated three-quarters of a mile to the south of the town, and a quarter of a mile from the landing ground. The Telegraph staff comprises one Assistant Superintendent and six Eurasian clerks. The garrison consists at present (January, 1922) of one British Officer and one platoon of Indian infantry. These are accommodated in brick huts in the Telegraph compound. The station is enclosed by sand bagged trenches, protected in front by a heavy barbed-wire fence. In the post are one machine gun and one Lewis gun. About 400 unskilled labourers could be collected locally, mostly from British Baluchistan, in about 3 weeks’ time, and double that number, if about 2 months’ notice were given. . Camping and convoy grounds are capacious and well situated on level ground to the north of the Telegraph buildings. Climate is fairly cool and healthy, except during June and Juty. Even then the south-west monsoon makes the heat considerably more tolerable than at Jask or in the Gulf. I he chief diseases are malaria and dysentery. Hea\y rain usually falls from December to February. The average amount is about 4 inches annually. A line of telegraph runs from Chahbar to Karachi via Gwatar, Pasni and Omara, one to Jask via Rapch, and two lines via Suntsin to Panjgur. A sub-marine cable runs from Chahbar to Jask. Makra.nl, a dialect of Baluchi, is the language spoken here; Hindustani is generally understood, but Persian is rarely used or understood. There are three wells, one in, and two along side a garden, situated half a mile from the station. One well belongs to the Telegraph Department, the water o- winch is pumped into a peservoir and thence by a pipe to tl the in d thre' priv but quir surd brae Tl firm; Tl fron soutl extei the &lt; fort marl Tl here T1 Bali bad! who: placi qual the 1 to c silks post clerl the 1 Tl Bom forti Ti hnis of i29 to the quarters. The second well has been given over for the use of the garrison, whose supply has to be brought in daily by mules and stored in tanks, of which there are three, each of 400 gallons capacity. The third well is private property. These three wells are soon exhausted, but rapidly refill, and their capacity should meet the re quirements of a battalion. Other wells could probably be sunk clbse by. The remaining wells in Chahbar are brackish, and the supply barely suffices for the village. There are no tugs, launches, skilled labour nor European firms, and no defences nor local forces. The town lies round a ruined fort standing 300 yards from the shore at the head of a small bay. Close to the south are gardens, with a few fruit trees and date palms, extending for half a mile inland in a valley lying inside the coast hills. At a short distance to the north-east of the fort is a large white tomb, the dome of which is a land mark at sea. There is an official of the Persian Customs Department here. The population is mixed, and numbers about 3,000 chiefly Baluchis with a few negroes. There are about 300 Hydera- badls and 200 Khujar merchants and shop-keepers, in whose hands is a very large portion of the trade of the place. The chief exports are sharks’ fins, ghi of excellent quality, barley and cotton, though the quantity of all except the first named has greatly diminished in recent years owing to continual droughts. Imports are chiefly piece goods, silks and foodstuffs. There is a British and a Persian post office here. The former is in charge of one of the clerks of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the latter in charge of the Customs official. The B. I. Company’s slow mail steamers running between Bombay and Basrah call in here each way, normally once a fortnight. Tiz .—Is a small village consisting of some 15-20 reed Tiz - huis inhabited by fishermen. It is situated at the opening of a valley, north of the tableland, and hills separate itCwaur. Oalog. from Chahbar from which it is about 3£ miles distant. It may, under certain circumstances, be considered a more convenient landing place and base to work from. In calm weather a large number of ships could anchor in 5 fathoms about 2 miles from the beach. The coast between Chahbar and Tlz point is marked by the termination of the tableland in cliffs about 150 feet high which slope down to a sandy beach, backed by a valley north of the point. Only the beach is available for landing troops and stores. It is f mile in length and 100 yards wide, and gradually slopes down to the water’s edge. It is sandy and easy to land upon. Boats drawing 5 feet can approach within 20 yards of it. No facilities exist, but stone for constructing wharfs, etc., is obtainable quite near by, though timber is scarce. Water is sweet and there is plenty of it obtainable from 3 wells in the bed of the Nunkhan! Nullah. Other wells could be sunk. Gwatar.~-ls equally divided between British and Persian territory. The village and the mouth of the river Dashtiari Chll are in Persia. There is no harbour, and the roadstead is shallow, exposed and unsuitable for large vessels. There is an anchorage in 4 fathoms wdthin 2 miles of the shore but shoals were reported in 1915. The inhabi tants belong to the Maid tribe. They number about 1,000 and are all fishermen. The Customs Department have an official here. Gdlag .—Is a small dirty village of about 15 fishermen’s huts on the east side of the eastern branch of the delta of the Rapch river about 700 yards from the river mouth. The roadstead is open, and about 3 miles from the shore, where the anchorage, in 7 fathoms, has good holding ground. There are five boats of 20 tons employed in trade with Masqat, Qishm and other places. It is reported that, owdng to the bar silting up, boats have now some difficulty in entering. A good landing place is situated just inside the entrance of the river to the east side, on to a steep beach. Men can land drysbod.

If there ia too much sea to enter, then the best landing place is about 1^ miles east of the creek. During a heavy swell a landing would be difficult. Water is good from shallow wells in years of normal rainfall. For the last two years (1921) it has been scarce. There is a small date grove near the village, and the inhabitants should be able to supply fish, but there is little else except a few livestock. Besides these there are several small bays and indenta tions, which are only used by the fishermen and smugglers. (6) Kerman. The province of Kerman is bounded by the Persian Gulf Boundaries, and by districts of Shamal, Biaban and Jask on the south. Its eastern boundary runs from the north-eastern corner of the Jask district almost due north to a little west of Kasratabad Sipl along the western boundary of Persian Baluchistan. From the vicinity of Nasratabad Sipl it marches along the southern boundary of Kain to a point near Darband, thence to a point about 20 miles south-east of the town of Yazd ; from this point it runs almost straight to the sea, forming in turn the eastern boundaries of Yazd, Fars and Laristan, and reaching the sea at a point about 25 miles west of Bandar Abbas at the mouth of the Shor river. The province is divided into about 28 roughly defined Adminmtrttiv# districts, of which only those of (a) Kerman, (b) Khabis, (c)'Rafsinjan, (d) Sirjan, (c) Bam and Narmashlr, (/) Jiruft, (g) Rudbar and (h) Bashakard are of particular importance, the remainder being for the most part moun tainous, sparsely populated and capable of producing little in the way of supplies. (a) The district of Kerman comprises only the area RermSn Piitrict lying immediately around the town, and is important, not so much for what it produces or contains, as from the fact of being the chief centre of this part of Persia. It is luilciently described on page 33.32 Khabis. (b) Khabis is a small district lying about 50 miles east of Kerman, and divided from it by a range of hills. It is bounded on the east and north-east by the Lut desert, and its chief importance lies in the fact that across it passes the main caravan route from Kerman to Khorasan across the Lut. Its chief village is Khabis. Rafsinjan. (c) Bafbinjan, of which Bahramabad is the chief town, consists of a plain about 80 miles long and 20 miles broad running roughly east and w'est, and receiving on the north the drainage of the Kuh-i-Badaman mountains and on the south that of the ranges lying to the north of Pariz and Saidabad. The plain is a bare expanse of hard chay and rises gradually from the east from about 4,700 to 5,500 feet. Across it runs the main Kerman-Yazd road. The district comprises about 90 villages with an aggregate population ot some 60,000 souls, most of whom are engaged in the production of cotton and wool. Sirjan. {d) Sirjdn, the chief place of which is Saidabad, is situated about 100 miles south-west of Kerman. It is surrounded by mountains, on the north by the Kuh Namzar range, on the east by the Kuh Panj ami Kuh Tambur, on the south by the Kuh Khajui and the Kuh Kaviz and on the west by the Kotru and Bishneh mountains. It is well irrigated b\ streams from the northern and eastern hills, and the cultivated area is considerable. Sirjan district is about 80 miles long from north to south and 70 miles wide irom east to west, and consists for the most part of a very fertile plain, the western‘part, however, is kuvir, and quite waste. Bam and Martnashlr, (e) The Bam and Narmashlr district is bounded on the north and east by the Lut desert, on the south-east by Persian Baluchistan (Bampur), to the west by Rayin, while to the south the Jabal Barlz range separate's it from inn m ^ C ° nS1 ' ts of a fertile undulating plain about 100 miles long and varying from 35 to 85 miles in width. di• tbe n Ud 18 in 1 the lmnds of a ^w Khans.

It is abont 300 feet above sea level, 50 railes long l&gt;y 22 miles wide and has a permanent population of about 2000 families. It is watered mainly by the Halil Rud, and has a normal rain and snowfall. Population of about 2000 families. There is an abundance of water available for cultivation. In seasons when there is a scarcity of raip and snow there is hardly enough water to cultivate the upper Jlruft, and for this reason about every fourth year must be considered a dry year, though even then by means of qanats the inhabitants usually manage to secure a yield of two-thirds of the normal crop. The population is, however, small owing to the absence of security in the district. The Rudbarls have managed to establish themselves in the district with armed supporters and,*having prevented, the Jlruftis from keeping any arms, are able to rule supreme and are doing everything in their power to ruin the district. During June, July and August nearly every one leaves the district, taking to the cool mountains, white with the advent of the cool season there is a great influx of tribesmen, who spend the winter in * the district, grazing their docks. R (g) nmlhar a rich district lying to the north of ,s hakard w , lth wlneh is combined administratively is bounded on the north by the Jabal Bariz range and Jiraft, on the east by Bampiir, and on the west by a line running approximately due north from Jaghin. Like Jlruft it &amp; J' 1 ' Wa . ere&lt; ^ nd sparsely populated. It is however very little cultivated in proportion to its possibilities. ‘ Bashakard, (h) BashSkard is a mountainous and wild district lying to the south of Rudbar and the Jaz Murian Hamim.

In the north the mountains consist of a very pronounced succession of ridges extending across the whole breadth of the province from the Lut to the coast of the Persian Gulf. Further east the chain gradually narrows till it reaches the range of Jabal Bariz which divides the plain of Bampur from the Lut desert. The main chain is divided into four separate ranges (1) The most westerly is the Lalehzar about 70 miles south of the city of Kerman. It rises to a height of ] 4,350 feet and overlooks the district of Rabur to the south. This range abounds in game. The road from Baft to Kerman cuts through it at the Kalanu Pass which is 9)400 feet above the sea. Its northern slopes are steep but those to the south more gradual. (2) The next and adjoining range, the Kuh-i-Bahr Asman, is a long ridge averaging 10,000 feet above tlie sea along its entire length. It has a few copper mines which are only worked spasmodically. (3) The next ridge is the Kuh-i-Zarab which is cut through at Gudar-i-Sarbistan (9,300 feet) by the road leading from Shaikh Bakhtiyar to Rayin. (4) The range becomes a very pronounced one, when it reaches the Kuh-i-Jabal Bariz, the most extensive of the chain, which divides the hot country of the Jlruft from the uplands of Rayin and Sarduieh. It contains the great peak Anjaz (12,450 feet) which towers above Dasari and separates Jfruft from the districts of Bam and Narmashir. To the east of this section is the Zumak Pass (9,310 feet) while the prolongation of the range beyond this is called the Shah Sawaran Kuh, which is again cut through by the Gishu Pass (3,660 feet). Many of the valleys enclosed in this massive wall of mountains are rich and cultivated and have large orchards, i he hillsides are thickly covered with shrubs and trees of all sorts, amongst which are fine oak, fig, cypress, etc. Game abounds.35 Further south is the Bashakard range dividing the plain of Bampur from the sea. It consists of one main rugged range running approximately east and west and serves as a watershed for streams draining into either the Gulf of Oman or the Jaz Murian Hamun. It is a labyrinth of rugged and impracticable hills, intersected by huge water courses. The lines of communication mostly follow the latter, but even these are often impassable, owing to the enormous boulders which fill the river-channels, and to the great ridges of uptilted strata with which the country is intersected, and which often convert the banks into perpendicular scarps many feet in height, at the foot of which water lies, still and deep. The slopes are covered with the usual stunted vegetation found in such localities, and wherever there are level places these are generally sparsely wooded with trees of a thorny nature such as the bu and varieties of the mimosa and acacia family. These often grow to an enormous height, attaining 40 to 50 feet with a circumference of 6 feet at the base. The best feature of the Bashakard is the abundance of water. Nearly all the streams have a plentiful supply of running water, which is almost invariably good. In this respect, at least, this region forms a pleasing contrast to the rest of Persia. For in Kerman province, with the exception of the Halil Rud, rivers are unimportant. In the desert, west, south and east of Kerman, water for the villages has to be conveyed from the hills for many miles by means of qanats. Narmashlr and Jlruft are less arid than other parts of the province, but even in the former the desert is encroaching. Few ranges are now covered at all extensively with timber; the forests are gradually dis appearing, being exhausted by charcoal burners. This probably accounts for the diminishing rainfall. The garmsir is the belt of country between the great mountain ranges and the sea, and in the area under review is composed largely of saline sand. It stretches inland across the plains of Rudbar and Jlruft. The date palm flourishes in. these parts. The Tlal'd, or Tlaliri Rud is the only river of any import ance in the province of Kerman. It rises in the mountains Garmsir. Rivers* Halil Uud.$6 to the west of Sardfiieh, and after a generally south easterly course across JTruft and Rudbar mingles its waters with those of the Bampur river in the Jaz IJdurian Hamun. It does not possess a perennial flow of water throughout its course, and running water is said to exist permanently only as far south as Bijnabad, though it can always be obtained by digging IQ to 15 feet below its bed. It is, however, liable to sudden floods, and in places becomes on these occasions as much as one mile broad. Its bottom and banks are of sffnd. Part of the Lut desert lies within the limits of Kerman. Though impassable for anything but the smallest body of troops, it is feasible for caravans and there is more water than was formerly supposed. The term Lut is a general term for wastes in this part of the country, but dil'feis from kdvir, as it may have sand interspersed over its surface, whereas kdvir never has; also the lut desert is generally sprinkle^ on the borders at any rate with Thorny shrubs which afford grazing for camels. The interior of the desert is absolutely devoid of all signs of animal or vegetable life. The Jaz Murian Hamun lies between Bampur and Khaim. As shown on most maps the extent is misleading. The entire ground between Kalanzau on the east and Zeh Kaliit on the west, is liable to inundation during the rains. Between these two spots is the actual limit of the swamps, making it some 50 miles by 20. There are said to be two separate swamps, called Milan and Jihum. Jaz Murian is a sweet-water lake, in which water remains permanently only between Kalanzau and Gumbaz. In the hot weather the swamp is mostly dried up. The chief towns of Kerman are:— Kerman, elevation 5,680 feet, the capital of the province; is mainly surrounded by desert, but being at the junction of many trade routes the town is important as a trade centre. It is surrounded by a clay wall 30 feet high wldch is in a good state of repair with a ditch 40 feet wiue and 10 feet deep forming an irregular hexagon,37 measurinc: rcmehly a mile from east to west and slightly more from north to south. Touching it on the western side is the Ark in which the Governor-General resides, and which contains the post and telegraph offices, barracks and arsenal, all in good repair. For water it is dependent on qanats, though every house has a well. It is about 5 miles south-west of a range of mountains which are from 6-12,000 feet above sea level and which run from north-west to south-east. At a distance of 20 miles south east of the town this range turns west and north-west. The principal passes through these mountains are :— (1) the Gudar-i-Khorasan, 7,650 feet high, 35 miles north of Kerman on the Kerman-Khorasan road across the Lut desert; (2) the Gudar-i-Tagan, 7,500 feet high, 30 miles north east of the town on the Kerman-Khabis road; and (3) the Nabid pass, 8,000 feet high, 45 miles south-east of the town on the Kerman-Bam- Duzdap road. The first two of these passes are only crossed by mule tracks, but the road over the third is fit for motors, and was constructed by the South Persia Rifles. Half a mile away from the town in an easterly direction is a limestone crag, some 500 feet above the plain, upon which are built the two forts of Kerman. The first is built of colossal sun-dried bricks, resting on stone founda tions, which are still in almost perfect preservation ; below this on a westerly spur is a second keep from which the road winds up to the castle on the crest, which possesses a triple line of defence. The second fort is situated on another crag of smaller dimensions half a mile north-west of the first one ; and between these two were the palace and other buildings, which are now a heap of ruins. On the southern spur of the main crag is a detached cliff, with 143 steps hewn out of the rock leading up to it. Immediately below- is the deserted quarter of Farnitan. There are many other ruins in the plain. The population is assessed at some 50,000 (see Chapter Ulh There is a post and telegraph office ; also an English83 Khabis. Bahramabad. BaidabSd. Baft. Kbanu. Bam. Medical Mission with a hospital, and a branch of the Im- perial Bank of Persia. The city is famous for the manu facture of beautiful carpets. Khabis, elevation 1,8G0 feet, is a village on the edge of the Lut desert, 56 miles east of Kerman, which is the centre of the district of the same name. It has a popula tion of about 5,000 persons, mainly employed in raising dates and henna. Khabis is the point where the main caravan route from Kerman to Khorasan enters the Lut. It is a well watered oasis, but in summer its heat is so intense that the majority of the inhabitants leave it and take to the hills. Bahramabad, elevation 5,090 feet, a village situated about 75 miles west of the town of Kerman on the road to Yazd. It is the chief town of the district of Rafsinjan and the residence of the Governor. It has about 5,000 inhabitants, a well-built bazar and 3 or 4 caravansarais. Saiddbad, elevation 5,490 feet, is a busy, prosperous place and contains about 9,000 inhabitants. It is encircled by a high wall and is situated near the southern end of the great kdvir in a fertile plain studded with magnificent trees. The town lies on a main route between Bandar Abbas and Kerman and Yazd, and has a post and telegraph office. Caravan routes radiate in all directions, the most important being to Kerman, Bandar Abbas, Yazd, Shiraz and Darab. Baft, elevation 7,290 feet, the chief town of the small district of Aqta. It ha c come down in the world of recent years and only has abort. 200 houses and a population of 2,000. A fair amount of supplies could be collected here from the surrounding country. It lies on the main road from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, and has a telegraph office on the main line between those two places. A branch telegraph line runs from here to Saidabad. Khanu, elevation 1,580 feet, is the capital of Rudbar district and has a population of 2-3,000. Its fort has been destroyed by an earthquake. Fair quantities of supplies should be available here from the surrounding country. Bum, elevation 3,500 feet is situated about 120 miles south-east of Kerman and 180 miles north-east of Bandar3P AliHs about 8 miles from tlie edge of the Lut, in tho fertile’ and wealthy district of Bam-Nannashir and 19 o^vyed by the three mam caravan routes of which the one to Bandar Abbas via Jlruft is a good road, but at times troubled by nomads. Caravans take 15 to 20 days t,, do the journev. The other two caravan routes form the Kerman-Bam-Duzdap road, which is passable for light lorries and touring ears, and brings Bam within three days of railhead at Duzdap. Bam consists of the old and new towns, the former crowded within the wall that surrounds the fort, the lat-cr along both: banks of a river liable to floods, i he mhabi ants number about 13,000. The great fort is built of sundried bricks and is • famous in history ; it is still in a fair state of preservation and contains some muzzle-loading field guns. (c) Bandar Abbas. The Bandar Abbas area consists in addition tothe town of that name, of the districts of Blaban, Shamil and Minab and the islands of Qishm, Henjam, Hormuz and Larak. The district of AbmadI, which was _ formerly in this area, was some years ago separated from it and place under the jurisdiction of the Qawam-ul-Mulk, head of the Arab tribes. For purposes of convenience however it is here included under the heading of Bandar Abbas. (1) Bandar Abbas.—Bandar Abbas town stands at the Bandar Abba*; foot of the bay, and consists of a sqitalhd collection of flat-topped houses extending about Hi Allies along the shore and about half a mile inland. The buildings approach to within 100 yards of the water. There are about 1,000 mud brick houses, many being two-storied. Except the main bazar there are practically no streets, each house or group of houses standing in its own enclosure. Theve^ is no wheeled traffic of any sort, and the heavy sand both inside40 and outside the town makes all progress slow and tedious. The only stretch of good going is along the w^et foreshore. The beach is good firm sand, and the tide runs out to a distance of some 160 to 200 yards. The immediate surroundings are bare sandy desert. North of the town and lying roughly parallel to the sea •extends a belt of very low, broken foothills, some 100 feet high, consisting chiefly of limestone and. volcanic rock, intersected with valleys and ravines. The depth of these foothills is approximately five miles and the length some four and a half miles on either side of the town, where they merge into the surrounding broken country and their outline is lost. At a distance of about 800 yards from the northem outskirts of the town and some 1,600 from the sea, these foothills drop into a flat, sandy plain, and give the appear ance, -when viewed from seaivard, of a low rocky ridge running parallel to the coast line. This apparent ridge converges to within 400 yards of the British Consulate, situated three-quarters of a mile to the east of the town, and recedes slightly again to 600 yards from the camp at Naiband, 2£ miles further east. Up to this line excellent cover and protection would be afforded to an enemy advanc ing from the north, or land side. The country around the town is flat and sandy, and ’could be completely covered by the fire of gunboats in the inner anchorage. There are no sea or land defences. Bandar Abbas is the residence of a Deputy Governor, appointed by and subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Governor’s house is s'tuated near the pier, and is surmounted by a cupola, but is not conspicuous. A British Consul is situated at Bandar Abbas. The Consulate, a grey stone two-storied house with a flagstaff, standing alone and conspicuous, is about three-quarters of a mile to the east of the town. It is an imposing double storied structure, built of stone, standing in a compound ,70 yards square. It has a large enclosure on the north side, sub-divided into courtyards and quarters, wdiich on41 occasions have harboured’ as many as 600 refugees. la cn adjoining compound, 130 yards by 50 yards, are its own post and telegraph offices, hospital, infantry lines and a large well giving an ample supply of brackish water, practically undrinkable. The defensible 6-foot mud wall surrounding the whole has circular bastions for flank defence. On the eastern outskirts of the town. 20 feet above the river bed and 150 feet west of it, is a carauansarai. Ships at Bandar Abbas drawing up to 17 feet can anchor Harbo “ r - 2 miles from the beach. There is an anchorage in 4 fathoms 2£ miles out, for 2 miles each side of the town. Ships approach and anchor on the lead. Holding ground is good, being sand and mud. During a strong south-east wind there is considerable surf on the beach. Steamers usually anchor in the vicinity of a buoy about 2 miles from shore on the edge of the 4 fathom line. Gunboats could anchor a mile from the landing place opposite the town. r i here is safe anchorage for a large number of ships. No fixed moorings are provided. A fixed white light is hoisted at night above the Consulate, it is visible about 8 miles at sea. The steamers of the 13. 1 Company call in here once a week on their way up and down the Gulf, and steamers belonging to other companies call in nt irregular intervals. The coast is a very gentle shelving sand hence the distance of the anchorage. The beach is of sand and mud, and very soft, without cliffs. At low tide the shore is so flat that small boats take the ground 100 yards from the water’s edge. Tides and currents are not strong enough to interfere with boats or landing. During rough weather, rollers or surf -are liable to capsize a boat, or broach it to. If landing 3 miles west of the town caution is necessary as the tidal streams of the Clarence Strait set up strong currents. The foreshore dries up, at spring tides, for 200 yards42 arrass sAESSTiS to 600 to 800 yards. No pilots are needed. i. „ e+onm and a motor launcn. the The Customs have » ^ an(1 d ,. aws 6 feet of fomer, ;kl i 3 ’ some 30 feet long and draws about water. ^ 3 M.’s Consul has another steam 1 whieh is of the same dimensions as that belonging 1 small motor launch of the Eoyal Indian Marine is under the charge of the 0. C. troops. The locality is not adapted for dredging, unless such work is undertaken on a large scale m connection with harbour construction. Naiband Camp.-^bm the Headquarters of the South Persia Rifles were moved from Bandar Abbas up 19M, and the two other chief centres were formed at Storas and Kerman, Bandar Abbas became- the base for the latter centre, and in addition for the former until the opening of the Bushire—Shiraz road in 1918 by the Bushire Fie Force. During this time a large camp was toraed at Naiband, some three miles to the east of Bandar Abbas, number of solidly constructed permanent type buildings, among which was a pier, were erected, the termination of the Great War putting a stop to the completion of t!ie scheme for the formation of a base. Landing facilities—There is an unfinished pier opposite the camp 1,400 feet in length by 15 feet in breadth, builtof wooden piles on a stone foundation, capable of taking the weight of any guns which could be transported across country in Persia. There is a steam crane, capacity i tons, on broad guage rails, which runs 100 yards back from the head of the pier. A light trolley line runs from the head of the pier to the Military Works yard in the camp. (At the present moment however there are only four trucks left.) A pipe line from water tanks north of the camp is laid on to the head of the pier for the use of launches, etc. At high water there is a depth of 9-12 feet of water43 at the head of the pier, but at low water it is left high and dry. Troops at low water would have to wade 100 to 200 yards to reach the shore. 1 his pier was originally inteuded to be much longer. Landing could be effected at any point up to three miles west of the town, or nine or ten miles east of it, but it would have to be through surf in small boate, and the troops would have to wade a long distance'' at low water. The surf is only dangerous with a strong gale. Bad weather seldom lasts more than two days at a time The beach is hard and firm below high water mark. The unfinished metalled road to Kerman, which starts from the shore end of the pier branches off to the east some 600 yards from the centre of the camp: wagons and carta would have to be pulled through heavy sand for this distance. Buildings .—The following are the buildings erected, show ing their dimensions and present use:— 1. Indian Station Hospital. 170 feet by 42 feet. Pucca brick masonry, flat roof on iron rails; there are two wards, operation room, office and store rooms. 2. 7 Officers’ Bungalows. 56 feet 8 inches by 43 feet 9 inches. Kacha brick masonry with stone and cement foundations. These have 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms each making 14 officers’ quarters. 3. Officers’ Mess. 85 feet by 39 feet.' Kacha brick masonry with stone and cement foundations. 5 small rooms 2 bathrooms. 4. 6 Kacha brick buildings averaging 13 feet by 70 feet, servants’ quarters, cook houses, etc. 5. 2 Barracks. 200 feet by 53 feet.

Exchange in the camp. Tele phone installed in the mess, Officers’ quarters and offices ; also connections to the British Consulate and the town. 5. Timber Pier. Generally two companies of Indian infantry could with ease be accommodated in the existing buildings. The stone used in part of the buildings was brought from Henjam Island and 1 is of fairly good quality. Wafer Supply .—An abundant supply of good drinking water is obtained from a well situated about 700 yards north of the camp. The water is pumped up by an oil engine at the well, through two 4 inch pipe lines, partly underground and partly exposed where they cross two small nullas, to iron tanks situated at a high level, some 500 yards north of the camp. The tanks, which are all covered in, are six in number, each having a capacity of 1,600 gallons. ater is laid on by pipes to all the bungalows. r l Ids supply never failed since its installation in late 1918. (In the summer of 1920 and 1921 the average consumption Th a die of w very whirl It ha respc provi the i there wash quarl Th from those dated upon in th Ro town is th] Kern meta rapid over beym Ca camp the v Lo 10 to 20, t bums tonm of Cf wate]45 lild- rick mis iclia •ick. iimo S.

The well, which has been brick lined and covered in, has a diameter of 13 feet and a depth of 30 feet. The depth of water measured in March was 15 feet and this remains very constant. There is one well situated inside the camp which was used before the present system was introduced. It has plenty of water, but of inferior quality, and it was responsible for a good deal of sickness. A marked im provement in the health of the troops has taken place since the new well outside the camp was brought into use, and there has been no water-borne disease since this date. For washing purposes water is drawn from a well situated a quarter of a mile from the centre of the camp. The water supply of Bandar Abbas town is bad, being from brackish wells, and can only be regularly drunk by those used to it. There are 14 birkehs, mostly in a delapi- dated condition and whose water supply cannot be depended upon. The Naiband well has the only good drinking water in the neighbourhood. Roads .—The road between Naiband and Bandar Abbas town is little better than a track in many places; the going is through heavy sand. Of the proposed Bandar Abbas—- Kerman road some ten miles only were completed (fully metalled) when work was stopped. This section is now rapidly falling into disrepair, and in many places is covered over with sand drifts. A further section of six miles beyond the metalled portion has been graded. Camping Grounds. —^Excellent and extensive convoy and camping grounds, well-drained, sandy and level exist to the west of the camp. Local Craft .—There are 10-12 rowing boats (capacity 10 to 15 men) and some 30 sailing boats. Of these, about 20, the majority of which are mashuwahs, Sambugs, and bums, are generally to be found in the roadstead. Their tonnage varies from about 20 to 25 tons, they are capable of carrying 30-35 men. They draw from 6 to 8 feet of water. _ *4f&gt; Light tianvw&amp;ys, owing to the flatness of the country, would be easily constructed and would be very useful. There are practically no facilities for landing at the town. There are no wharfs and no landing appliances. The pier, 23 yards wide, opposite the centre of the town, extends about 100 yards into the sea from high-water mark. At low water it is high and dry. At high-water, boats drawing G or perhaps 8 feet (at high springs) could be worked at the extreme sea end. Being in a very dilapidated condition, it would not bear the weight of heavy guns. Goods are landed in lighters which come alongside the pipe when the tide is high enough. The pipe would require to be extended 100 yards further to be of use for launches and | heavily-laden barges at all states of the tide. At night- one Kitson lamp of about 100 candle power sheds a feeble light on it. In the cold season 400 to 500 coolies are procurable for wharf and lightermen. In the hot season not more than 200 are available. The Customs warehouses and other private godowns are situated in the vicinity of the pier. These are at present in a fairly good state of repair, but during the rainy season from November to March tarpaulins would be necessary in some of the I private godowns. The capacity of the former is given as approximately 5-6,000 bags of grain, and of the latter as 18-20,000. Other than for camels there is no grazing procurable in the vicinity. A cable and land line via Qishm Island connect with the Indo-European Telegraph station at Hen jam Island. The office is at the British Consulate. A line of 3 wires con trolled by the same (Department also runs via Baft tc Kerman. The office is in the town. . A P ost offi ce is situated in the British Consulate. There is a Persian post office in the town.

(2) Bldban .—The district is about 50 miles in length and 10-20 in breadth, and is bounded on the west by the tea and on the east by the crest of the range of ills which runs .parallel to the coast at a distance o. j. 0-15 nuks inland, dividing Biaban from Bashakard and Rudbar. The northern boundary, which divides it from the Minab sub-district, runs roughly east and west to the south ot the village of Taling, while on the south Kith Mubarak is the dividing line between Biaban and Jask. The Kuh-i- Blaban range which forms the eastern boundary rises to heights varying from 2,000 feet in its northern half to 4,000 in its sou them. Between this range and the sea lies a well defined subsidiary range, which starts from the coast at Kuhistak, and after trending some miles inland, rejoins the coast at KAh Mubarak. This range, which is composed entirely of sandstone, never attains a greater height than 000 feet. It dirides Biaban into two natural divisions, the western of which is a flat plain, in winch lie the majority of the villages of the district, while ibe eastern is a succession of small valleys, cut off from each other by outlying spurs from the ranges on either side or by rugged plateaux. There are no rivers of any importance in the district. The coast line is low and sandy. There are few creeks or inlets, and none of those which exist are of any con sequence except that which forms the anchorage for Siiik. The whole length of the coast is very exposed, and landing is therefore difficult, more especially os there is a very flat foreshore. Bandar Sirik is the most suitable landing place, and this is best negotiated at higb tide, \&gt;hen a narrow channel can be seen through the surf leading towards the southern side of the creek, where are usually to be found in the windy and stormy season one or two ^M Shamil and MSuiib. 4 ff small boats. Only very light draught boats can be used within about half a mile of the shore. The soil of Blaban is clayey in parts and sandy else where. Near the coast quicksands are common. (3) Shamil and Mindb.—A district of Persia, bordering the north-west side of the loop formed by the Gulfs of Persia and Oman at their junction ; it includes the port of Bandar Abbas, The bulk of Shamil lies east of Bandar Abbas in the form of a somewhat elongated parallelogram with its south-west corner close to the west of that town. The district is a maritime plain enclosed between the sea and bold mountain ranges, of which the elevation generally exceeds 3,000 feet. The dominant feature of the whole country is the Kiih-r-Ginau, the summit of which reaches 7,783 feet at a point 18 miles north-north-west of Bandar Abbas. The mountains to the north rise very steeply from the plain and attain 4,481 feet in the Kuh-i-Namak at their western end and 6,057 feet in Kul Nian at their eastern extremity ; between these points they are interrupted by four gaps through which Valleys of some size descend to the plain, giving the range a disconnected appearance. The Kuh-i-Zindan range, JJso called the Rudbar hills, at the east of the district appears to have a nearly constant elevation of 3,000 feet- A great mountain situated out side the district but visible from the Persian Gulf is Kuh-i-Bakhun which is 42 miles north of Bandar Abbas, 10,660 feet high and covered with snow in winter. Besides these considerable mountains the district pos sesses a generally low and in places ill-defined sandstone ridge, which subtends the sea^eoast at a distance of from d to 10 miles and divides the country into two portions that differ widely in their characteristics ; the ordinary height ol this ridge is perhaps 200 feet, but at a point 13 miles west by north of Bandar Abbas and 6 from the sea it reaches a height of 1,645 feet. On the east this ridge dies aw ay a little east of Baghu. Between this ridge and the mountains the land is a fertile plain, while betwi •on it and the coast lies a sandy plain impregnated with salt and49 « diversified, at intervals, by date groves and small patches of cultivation. Prom the sand stone ridge numerous steep sided ravines, containing no water, except during heavy rains, run down to tlie coast. The sea shore is sandy in its whole extent. There is a salt stream running down to the sea at a point 8 miles west of Bandar Abbas called the Rud Shor. In addition to this the district contains some clear flowing streams and springs, especially in proximity to the hills. The water of moet of these is absorbed in irrigation, or by the porous soil, before reaching any channel by which it could be brought to the coast. The inhabitants are a weak, peaceable and oppressed people, and as cultivators idle and unthrifty. They live in the majority of cases in date leaf huts and so long as they can obtain enough dates to eat they are quite content ed. There are practically no arms amongst them; only a headman here and there owns a rifle or two. The chief cultivation is dates and barley which form the staple food, but in some places wheat and tobacco are grown, the latter especially around Gurband and Karyan, both in the Mlnab district. The chief town of the district is Minab, which stands on the left bank of the MTnab river and is immediately com manded on the east side by some hills which rise to 040 feet and carry a large bnt very dilapidated fort overlooking the town ; the whole hillside is covered with ruined bastions, towers and walls. The greater part of the town consists of mat huts, but at the foot of the hill on which the fort stands is a quarter about 5 acres in extent, with many good and substantial houses ; this quarter was originally enclosed, but the wall is now’ in ruins and only the towers end bastions remain. On the southern side are extensive plantations and gardens and here begins an enormous date belt, about 6 miles in breadth, which follows the course of the Mlnab river within 13 miles of the sea. There are about 2,000 houses and a maximum population estimated at about 10,000. The inhabitants are civil and obliging. L391CGS50 Supplies of all kinds are procurable at ^Mln.ib, if there has been a good rainfall the preceding winter. ater, which is from the Minab river and canals dependent on it, is good and abundant ; there are also a few wells. Minab Khur is a salt water creek 33 miles east by south of Bandar Abbas into which the Minab river discharges. The bar, which is nearly dry at low water, is some one and a half miles from the sea. The river is navigable for vessels drawing up to 6 feet of water for a distance of 9 miles from the mouth. The channel of the river is winding and navigation difficult. A Customs House, in which there are 4 tufanghchls, is situated at Shah Bandar, 9 miles from the mouth. The facilities for smuggling and gun-running in the neigh bourhood are unlimited. It is an indifferent harbour, but native boats not exceeding 20 tons can use it, entering at high water. Abroad!. The Islands, Qishm Island. (4) Ahmadh —The district of Ahmad! takes its name from a tumble down fort and small village 110 miles north of Bandar Abbas and 25 miles north-west of Sar-i- Sikh. The village, which consists of only some 12 houses, is surrounded by cultivation and date groves, among which are other huts, singly or in groups of 2 or 3 : even those still further away among the hills are all known by the name of Ahmad!. There is a good quantity of supplies and fodder, and camel grazing is extensive. Water from a qanat is excellent, and fair mutton and vegetables can be procured. (5) The Islands .— Qishn Island .—The largest and most important island in the Persian Gulf is the island of Qishm. It subtends the Persian coast from Lingeh almost to Bandar Abbas. The islands of Larak and Henjam may be regarded physically as appendages of it. The extreme length of Qishm ia 68 miles with a breadth averaging 10 miles. The island is almost covered with table topped hills without any dominant peaks, though Kishkuh, the highest summit, nearly in the middle of the island and about 17 miles from aparl eonta the h west excel Th a mi straii by rc the \ mis t the read: and foun T1 of ti of ( Gust Qish It aggi Tl QU extr to tl grac wesl one fun for in a T tion ates boa mar of '51 from Basidu, reaches a height of 1,300 feet. Qishm is, apart from the villages, almost deserted, but the hills contain some animal life. The coast is rocky. Some of the hills, notably at Namakdan near the coast in the soutli- west of the Island, are composed almost entirely of excellent rock salt which is exported in large quantities. The total population of the island is about 13,500 souls, a mixture of Arab and coast Persian by race, the former strain predominating. The great majority are Sunnis by religion. A severe earthquake in 1898 reduced many of the villages and killed a number of the people. A mongrel mixture of Arabic and Persian is the language spoken in the Island. One or other of these languages is however readily understood everywhere. In Qishm Town especially, and even in the smaller coast villages individuals will be found who can converse in them. The local chief for administration, under the authority, of the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas, is the bheildi of Qishm, who resides in the town of that name. The Customs Department have a total of 10 officers situated in Qishm town and the more important coast villages. It is estimated that there are 279 native craft with an aggregate tonnage of about 6,500 belonging to the islands There are 33 villages on the island of Qishm of which Qishm is the chief. Qishm, which is situated at the eastern extremity of the island, stands on a level sandy site close to the sea. Behind it and to the south the land rises m a gradual slope, until it breaks off precipitously to the north west. There are 10 domed, water reservoirs but only one well, situated about a mile from the fort, furnishes good water ; this supply is generally sufficien for the population. An old Portuguese fort now stands in a ruined state. _ The climate is cooler than Bandar Abbas. The popular tion is roughly 3,500, in which the Arab element predomin ates. These are mostly engaged in the fishing industry, boat-building, and particularly boat-repairing, and the manufacture of lungis. Qishm is the chief importing centre of the Island and has a good deal of shipping, but there52 la no harbour, and off the town there are several banks of rock and sand. Vessels of moderate draught anchor m five fathoms about three quarters of a mile off shore; those of heavy draught in 6 fathoms at two miles distance, and there is an anchorage anywhere northward to the bank bordering the mainland. Anchorage is prohibited between lines drawn north north-eastward from about 800 feet an( j i miles north-westward of the fort, which is situated near the south end of the town. The anchorage near the town is well sheltered in a channel and there is no heavy sea with a nashi, but the tidal streams cause a vessel to lie broadside to the wind and to ride uneasily. A light buoy exhibiting a white flashing light is moored H miles east ward of Qishm fort. The inhabitants of the Island are perfectly docile. The standard of labour here compares very favourably as re gards efficiency and price (krcms 2 per day) with other parts of the Gulf, but is limited. Salagh is the chief fishing centre of the south coast, and exports fish to Lingeh, Bandar Abbas, Bahrein and Dubai. There is excellent water here from seven wells wdiich are well supplied even in years of drought. These w T ells quickly empty, but refill in a few hours. Sulphur is found in the Island, and there are indications that large quantities exist. This mineral was first worked in a small way by the Muin-ut-1 ujjar of Tehran, who formerly farmed the revenue of the Island, and in 1919-1920 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company quarried 100 tons at Namakdan for use with their electric plaqt at oil-borings works. Oil Borings .—The extremely favourable report of a geological expert decided the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to drill for oil in April, 1914, and ■work was begun in August of the same year. In July 1915 owing to several attacks on the works by Luris from Lingeh, instigated by the German agent Wassmuss, ex-Consul at Bushire, opera tions were suspended. In March 1916 work was resumed and boring started. At the present moment, (May, 1921) the boring has reached the depth of over 3,000 feet. Small quantities of oil have already been brought up, and there are favourable indications that a large supply may at any momeut be discovered. . - -5S ■ A former well was sunk, some 20 years ago, it « Mievei h a German Company, and abandoned when nothing was *' Thp headquarters of the present venture are situ- l Zt forelore u” west of Ras Takhum. The staff Isists of 4 Europeans of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company 'Two native employees. The boring is situated about Smiles west by north of the settlement and is reached by r • hnt san a v road. The anchorage is exposed to both winds. The beach is sandy and shelves gradually to the water’s edge. Landing is easy. There is an infantry guard of 1 Havildar and 18 found from the detachment at Hen jam with which they are in heliographic communication. There is no good drinking water nearer than Salagh, abont 3 miles away, and distilling has to be resorted to. Water for the boiler of the drilling plant is pumpet the distillery at the foreshore through a 2 inch pipe. Local well water is both turgid and brackish and i 3 supposed to cause softening and falling out of the teeth in those not brought up to its use. n „ A Bnsidu is a British station on the westernmost pomt of B^da. the island. Basidu point is a low cliff rising about 20 feet above high water ; the top is level with a few date trees and open to every wind. The station was practically unoccupied for some years but in 1910 was re-opened as a coaling station in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. In 1913 the co&lt; ^ depot was transferred to Hen jam. The former o cers quarters, hospital, sepoy lines and bazar an s ore houses have fallen into ruins, and the remaining ungar lows and buildings erected in 1910 into disrepair, quarter of a mile south-west of the point is a ags on which the British flag is hoisted when any vessel is in the anchorage. Alongside this is a small building, nown. as the ‘ Officer’s House in a fair state of preservation. It is now used as a store house for the flagstaff appara us. A stone pier extends 200 feet from the shore some yards north-west of Basidu point. It is about 12 fee wi Q and 4 feet high, and the water around it dries, the outer en54 Lift. being awash at low water. There are rough steps at the end and on both sides, but the whole pier is dilapidated and would need repairing before being of use. There are seven roofed-in reservoirs in good repair; average dimen sions are 45 feet by 12 feet by 10 feet. Three are Govern ment property and four belong to the inhabitants. There are 8 wells containing sweet water. These wells have only a few feet of water, but quickly refill after being emptied, and the quantity varies very little even in years of drought. Four miles east of Basidu at Nakhlistan there are some good wells and a date grove. There were never any per manent defences, and since 1913 there has been no British guard. The wireless station, workshops, etc., were also withdrawn when the station was closed down. The station is now unoccupied save for a few families of fishermen and herdsmen, about 50 in number, and an Arab caretaker who looks after the flagstaff and the European cemetery. R, I. M. S. Nearchus, the Lights and Buoys vessel of the Gulf, periodically visits the station to carry out any necessary repairs to the flagstaff. Basidu-i-Kuchak, or Persian Basidii is the name now frequently given to Hujar, a village of some 60 huts and 150 inhabitants situated about 2 miles from the point to the east of Clarence Strait. The inhabitants of Basidu possess a few cattle and 'donkeys, and some 200 sheep and goats. No supplies are obtainable. The anchorage here extends parallel to the shore on the north side of the point, and consists of a belt i mile broad, and 1 mile from the shore. The depth is 5 to 7 fathoms, and the^ clay bottom forms good holding ground. Landing is inconvenient in a swell, owing to the rocky nature of the coast, and a mud flat uncovered at low Water. Laft is a village on the west side of the salient from the north coast of the island, of which the extremity is Laft point. It is built at the foot of a hill 200 feet high, and the approach is by a narrow creek in which native craft lie. The village consists of 250 houses of Arabs and Persian*, engaged in fishing, boat building, and cutting fire-wood55 from the adjacent swamps. The water supply from roofed t ] .. ..ml wells is sliffhtly brackish. The livestock consists Stfew cIttH Sheep and gouts. The hill behind Laft is scarped and the scarps strengthened at their crests wit Sains and flanking works. These with a dilapidated fort having five circular towers pierced for guns, appear to b traces' of a former European occupation. Hen iom .—This island sometimes called the “ Perun of the llenjam. Persian Gulf” is situated off the south coast ot Qishm, and is divided from it by a strait, 1 mile wide and 0 to % 12 fathoms in depth. It would form a good base of naval observation, the gulf here being so narrow that the Arabian coast is visible on a clear day. 1 he island measures 5| miles from north north-east to south south-west by abou 3*miles in breadth and is an agglomeration of rugged hills (the highest 350 feet) decreasing in elevation towards the south end. It is a dismal mass of barren, broken and volcanic rock intersected with numerous wide valleys. The heat in summer is barely tolerable and is aggravated m Jane, July and August by sand-flies. The rainy season is from October to March, the fall varying considerably. Only three points are inhabited. On a cliff near the north coast, about a quarter of a mile from the shore, is situated the cable and wireless station of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in charge of an Assistant Superin tendent with some 6 Eurasian clerks. The quarters consist of two well-built stone houses. A cable and landlme con nect with Bandar Abbas. Since 1913 a naval coal depo has been established here. It is situated on the sioie in front of the Telegraph buildings, and is in charge o a Petty Officer of the Royal Indian Marine, who is the Marine Transport Officer. About 100 coolies are employed in the coal depot. Hen jam has now become the chief coaling base for the Navy in the south of the Gulf. ^ Landing Facilities —Opposite the coal wharf is a solidly constructed wooden pier, built by the Indian Governmen in March 1919, 321 feet in length, built on wooden beams 15 inches by 5 inches on steel piles. Landing Appliances .—There is a hand crane fixed at the end of the pier with a lifting capacity of about one ton.A double trolley line, total length 750 feet, runs from the head of the pier to the coal stacks. A three inch pipe line leads from a tank to the end of the pier for filling water barges. The depth of water at the head of the pier averages 15 feet at high tide and 10 feet at low water. Owing to the foundations of the pier for a distance of 170 feet from the head being of sand, no steam vessel of much more than 85 feet in length should he tied up alongside. Troops and stores to be landed on the pier would first have to be dis embarked into lighters or dhows. The Marine Transport Officer has a small steam vessel, the Miner, 110 tons register, for towing coal barges, etc. The B. I. Company’s slow Gulf steamers running between Bombay and Basrah call in here every week on their way up and down the Gulf. The Company’s agent (who is here the Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs) has one baghela of some 25 tons burthen, capable of carrying 50-60 men. Other craft could quickly be obtained at short notice, either from the Island or from Qishm. Camping Grounds. There is a good camping ground suitable for a battalion south-west of the Telegraph build ings on a slight rocky slope. More extensive spaces exist office fl&amp;t Sandy ValIe7 t0 the north ' east of the Telegraph Water Supply.—The water supply of the Telegraph staff and employees is obtained from five roofed reservoirs, total capacity 134,000 gallons, which are dependent on rainfall m winter for their supply. This supply is barely sufficient. Water for the employees of the coal depot is obtained from a condenser on the foreshore. This water is stored in 6 tanks, the total capacity of which is 158,144 gallons. A 3 inch pipe leads from one of the tanks to the head of the steam tug ^ barges ’ which su PP 1 y the tanks of the The condenser has a capacity of about 1,200 gallons daily, a . tl ^ es - 0f thi s quantity not more than 300 gallons would be available for outside purposes owing to57 ft, w demand of the coal depot Tor anything more a small detachment therefore sent to the station for !“ lensrth of time an additional distilling plant would b. necessary. . , _ . Post 0 ff [ ce ,—A British post office is situated in the Tele- mph office in charge of one of the clerks. The village of Hen jam at the south-east side has some 200 houses and 1,000 inhabitants of . ra ^/^w^re^es- feent the former stock predominating, they are acs oribed as intelligent, industrious and hospitable ; they occupied in date and other cultivation, fishing and pearling, for which they have some 25 boats; they own a few cattle, donkeys and goats. In the summer during^ the P ea . rllT ^ season (April to September) the village is practically deserted. The third settlement is Ghail, with about 30 houses, 3 miles south-west of the telegraph station There is an almost inexhaustible well here of excellent water, close by the beach, and a valuable anchorage, sheltered from the shamal, between Henjam and Qishm. This was formerly a rendezvous for piratical craft, and occasionally slavers, and is now much visited by native craft to take in water. The anchorage lies on both sides of a sandy spit opposite the coal depot and Telegraph buildings, at the most northern point of the island, and is sheltered from the prevailing winds. A beacon consisting of a post 1(1 feet ig sur mounted by a 9 foot triangle has been erected on this spit by the cable ship of the Telegraph Department, rom e eastern entrance it is inconspicuous except when e sun shines on it, and it is often obscured by dhows. The^ o m is hard, and holding therefore bad in places, especially as the ebb tide runs very strongly, this anchorage however was used throughout the war by numerous ships without incon venience. The depth is about 9 fathoms. Lights .—A white fixed light is exhibited at 128 feet abovs high water from the north-east corner of the Telegraph office; it is visible about 5 miles at sea. A fixed red light is exhibited at 30 feet above high water on the foreshore58 Honan. immediately behind the beacon on the spit. This is visible about 3 miles out to sea. The local administration is in the hands of the Sheikh who lives at the village of Hen jam. The only trace of Persian sovereignty is an office of the Persian Customs Department in charge of a subordinate official. This office, which is situated near the Telegraph buildings, was sent there only when the coal depot was established in 1913. Hormuz .—Tlie northern point of Hormuz, the site of the celebrated ancient city, is 11 miles east south-east of Bandar Abbas, and 4 miles south of the nearest part of the mainland. The passage between is navigable for vessels of moderate draught about its centre. Except at the northern and southern extremities, the island has a broad belt of shoal water. The hills average over 300 feet and one peak reaches 690 feet. All ravines and valleys in the interior are incrusted with salt, and the whole surface is almost entirely barren. Copper, specular iron ore, red oxide of iron, and salt exist on the island, but only the last two are worked. Before the Great War the red oxide ore was exported in large quantities to Europe, but since that date only one shipment (in 1919) has taken place. The exploitation of minerals in Hormuz, as well as in the other islands of the Gulf, is in charge of the Customs Department. The quantity of sweet water available from the reservoir is strictly limited; practically nothing else is obtainable. The only inhabited place is the village situated on the neck of the northern promontory between the Portuguese fort at its extremity and the ruins of the ancient city landwards. It consists of about 150 stone huts and 400 inhabitants of mixed Persian and Arab descent, whose staple industry is fishing. The village is practically deserted during the summer months, when the majority of the inhabitants go off to Mlnab. When the mines are worked several hundred coolies are imported from Qishm, Minab and Bashakard, but return to their homes during the summer months. There are 6 snmbuqs of 15-20 tons burthen, as well as a dozen or so small fishing boats. The anchorage is half a mile to the east of the old fort in 4 to 5 fathoms.

Wild semi- nomadic tribes, in every part of the kingdom, are ready at any moment to disown allegiance to the Central Govern ment, and can be restrained only by force and fear. The Mullahs of the Shiah religion are reactionary and dread anything that may weaken their prerogatives or dispel the superstition of the masses ; they, therefore, deprecate the spread of civic rights and liberties to their bond slaves. The governing and upper classes are all reactionaries and royalists. They are steeped in corruption, and have battened for centuries on such ill-gotten gains as an iniquitious system of Government allows them to squeeie out of the masses. The Persians are an emotional people, quick to seize upon a new idea or doctrine and their subtle, active brains render them peculiarly susceptible to the influence of any kind of sentimental or abstract teaching; hence a Persian crowd is easily manipulated by a demagogue. So it follows that a few enthusiasts of the younger generation, who have imbibed western ideas of freedom and constitutional rights, experience little difficulty in exciting an enthusiasm of popular feeling, at least momentary and spasmodic. Thus during the nationa list movement, at one time a fanatical populace was clamouring for a constitution and abolition of hoary wrongs, and at another was acquiescing, almost without a murmur, in the cannonading of its national assembly or the arrival of foreign troops to restore order. Charac teristics such as these are insufficient to bring about a sno- eeesfuf revolution, but afford a magnificent field for the machinations of agitators and adventurers. The success &lt;rf the constitutional movement was thus largely due to e adroit use of such inflammable material by a few bold leaders (mostly foreigners), who supplied the necessary61 i ffiionnt of courage, resolution and practical ability, whicH the Persian patriots lacked. As to any hopes that in t ie future Persia may grow strong and independent enough to conduct her own administration, with her own trained and proven leaders, two obstacles stand in the way. The first is the lamentable vanity so marked in the 1 ersian character which precludes them seeking or ensuing a good example. Up to a point they may appreciate, or even imitate, what other nations have achieved. The other obstacle is the reactionary Shi'ah religion, with its vested interests, its fanaticism, and its hatred of progress and modern enlightenment. An Intelligence officer should never believe, and never NotMto trust a Persian, or rely on his promises in any waj whatsoever. In dealing with the lower class Persian, formal interroga tion should be avoided. Much good information can be obtained in the course of friendly conversation. VV ith the upper classes of society the most punctilious regard to etiquette, and the exaction of the most scrupulous obser- vance of what is due in return, both in correspondence am conversation, are essential. All Persians are greedy o money and presents. They have a very high opinion o Europeans, who show skill in shooting and riding, and t ie ability to bear fatigue and exposure. (a) Persian Baluchistan—The majority of the popula- Perj.«^ #n tm are Baluchis. The Baluchistan organisation is essen tially feudal, and all power lies in the hands of the local chiefs, who are called Sarddrs or Mirs. The bulk of the population occupy a very subject position, and the Sardars own numbers of ghulams or slaves of both sexes. About 1,000 families have wandeiei into Sistan and Kain and 3,000 more into Khorasan. These communicate with their brothers iu Baluchistan. Many of them claim Arab descent. Many of the population are so backward and degraded as to be little better than primitive savages. They are generally thieves, liars and swaggering boasters. Politi cally they have two feelings ; an intense passion for tn )al independence, with all its murderous accompaniments ofBampur. On Said KTian’s death, Islam Khan, tK# guardian of his heir, Hussein Khan, was not strong enough to keep the petty chiefs under his control, and the Sherkhanzai influence is now limited to Geh and Bint. (c) Buledis, pride themselves on being the oldest family in Perian Baluchistan. They have however lost much of their land, and for many years have been very weak. They are much intermarried with the other tribes, more especially with the Sherkhanzais, Said Khan’s mother having been a Buledi. The chief Buledis now occupy Rask, Qasrqand and Fanuch. (2) Bampur .—Until the death of Bahram Khan, Baran- 1 tai, in 1021, the whole of Bampur, as well as Dizak and the Sarbaz sub-district of Makran was under the influence of the Baranzai family, who originally came from Dizak and occupied the place. The population of Bampur are for the most part Baluchis belonging to various tribes, whose numbers it is dimcu to estimate. The people of Bampur town are of a mixed race, very inferior to the ordinary Baluchi, and showing strong traces of negro blood. They are rude and uncivilised in their habits. They speak Makrani Baluchi. Chief among the Baluchi tribes of Bampur are: * (a) Baranzais, originally descended from Afghan stock. They first settled in Jalk and the Dizak valley, and gradually attained sufficient stiength to overthrow the ruling Bazurgzadus. Under Bahram Khan they became supreme over the whole of Bampur. They are universally disliked owing to the severity of Bahram Khan’s control. Bahram Khan’s successor in Bampur is his brother, Mir Ali Muhammad of Rusk.

Closely akin to the H5t Baluch, they stren ^ are taller and finer physically than the ordinary Tin Baluchis. They are warlike and independent and have a frank appearance. Though nomadic they return to villages in the date season. Iheir chief is Mr H5tl Khan of Lashar. g (3) Dizak, which was formerly under the Bazurgzadas, has now passed under Baranzai control. There are, as in other districts of Persian Baluchistan, a number of Baluchi tribes in Dizak, the chief of which, a iter the Baranzais, who are mostly found in the Dizak, Jalk and Irafshan areas, are:— (a) Bazurgzadas, are of Kurd origin and came originally from Bokhara. For many generations they provided the Hakims of Jalk, Dizak and Sib, and were the leading family in the district; but as the Baranzai influence has increased, so ^ has that of the Bazurgzadas proportionately decreased. They now hold Sib and Jalk, in the latter of which their control is only nominal. Their chief is Ghulam Rasul of Sib. (b) Kurds, the survivors of those who formerly ruled the Sarhad, are to be found in small numbers in Magas, but they have nearly died out. Their \ present chief is Shah Jehan of Magas. Both the above are bitterly hostile to the Baranzais and would gladly join any combination against them. ic) Nausherwdms, a small section of the Rinds, belong- j ing originally to British Baluchistan, which has crossed into Persian territory and has settled in Kuhak. Their present chief is Mir Mehrab Khan. (4) The Sarhad was from about 1908 to 1916 entirely under the control of the Damanis, who looted the other A66 about 400 families, made up of the FaMrzai (50 families), Hadizai (20), Daruzal (50), Allah Bakshzal (10), Balozai (10), Radozai (30) Jamsherzal (15), and Kamarza! Ismailzai (60)! to which may be added the followina:, who are not true Ismailzai, but have been living among them for many years:—Totozal (20), Gur^eech (20), Shahozal, (20), Hassanzai, (30), Muliara- madzal (12), and Kamarzal Muhammadzai (50). The Ismailzai are not in alliance with any other tribe, but are hostile to Sardar Khudadad Khan Nahrui of Sistan. (c) Ddmanis, are divided into two distinct sections, the Yarmuhammadzal and the Gamshadzai. The former have always resided in and around Khwash and towards Erindagan and Bampur, while the latter keep more to the east and south east haying their headquarters at Gusht and Jalk, and using the intermediate grazing grounds of the Safid Kuh and Naukdar valley. (1) i armuhammadzais, are entirely nomadic and by reason of their hard life and mountain homes are addicted to raiding and are exceptionally cruel by nature. They have no religious scruples; they lightly take and break the most solemn oaths ; they are lax about their women folk and divorce is extremely common among them. They are physically well set up. The tribe numbers some 250 families, and consists of the following sub-sections:—Sohrabzai, Sherazal, Roshanzai, Mirgulzal and Muham- madgulzai. To these may be added the follow ing unimportant sub-sections, who, though not actually Tarmuhammadzais, are closely con nected with them:—Muhammadzai, Rahmar- zal, Jamsherza! and Buranzai. The present chief of the tribe is Sardar Jahind of the Sohrabzai sub-section, in which the Sardarship has always been. -The Yarmuhammadzais67 were formerly hostile to the Baranzals of Bampur but of recent years Bahram Khan had shown himself more or less friendly to them. One peculiarity of this tribe is the control exercised by many of the women. (2) Gamshadzais, number 300 to 350 families, and consist of the following sub-sections:—T)ad- khudazal (70 families), Moradzai \50), Mezarzal of Sib (60), Muhammadzai of Gusht (20), Kerramzai of Gusht (20), Arzezai of Gusht (40), and Jehangirzai (30). To these may be added the Gisadzal (about 30), who live in Jalk and the only Gamshadzais on their mother side. The present chief is Nazar Khan of the Dadkhudazai sub-section, in which the (d) Sardarship has always been. The attitude of the Gamsbadzals has always been most satisfactory towards the British, and, had it not been for their Sardar Khalil Khan voluntarily supporting the T armuham- madzals in 1916, it is improbable that there would have been any trouble with them. They are infinitely superior to the Yaunu- hammadzals in character, and are not on very cordial terms with them. Like the Yarmuhammadzals they were formerly hos tile to the Baranzals of Bampur, but oi recent years Bahram Khan had been mo/e. or less friendly to them. Zurds .—There are small numbers of Kurds around msha, Khwash and Tamin, the remnants ot hose who once dominated the Sai ia • m&lt; ie Persian Governor of Bampur in 1889 mas- acred their chief men, the tribe has sunk mm ^significance. They are absolutely dominated by he Damanis. (e) Mir Baloaais, a tribe of cultivators and land owners of Kurdish origin, who are to be found68 scattered in small colonies at most of the cul tivable spots in the Sarhad. They are compelled to place their political interests in the hands of the particular tribe among which they are living, and as a result some are under Reki and others under Daman! influence. They are a peaceful, hardworking set of people. (/) Hashamzals, are a sect of cultivators and flock- owners of Sistani-Balueh origin to be found among the Reki tribe. They number about 45 families. (g) Tamlndanls, who are of Parsi origin, arg to be found living on the higher slopes of the Kuh-i- Taftan. They appear to be almost self-support ing and to be a hardy set of men. They number only about 60 families, and are of no political importance. &lt;h) Brahuls, numbering about 30 families, live near Dijjing and acknowledge Reki leadership. They are physically a fine set of men. Though of little importance in themselves, they have continually been the cause of local blood feuds. (i) Khwdshls, a small tribe of about 130 families, apparently aboriginal, which lives in the Khwash plain. They are closely connected with the Dehwars who live further south in Sib and Bampur. Both they and the Brahms call them selves Arbabls. They do not intermarry with the Baluchis, but have been forced by hard times to give many of their women to the Yannuham- madzais. They are short of stature, good culti vators, and of genial disposition. In Dizak and to a lesser extent in Bampur and the Sarhad are to be found the Arbabls and DeJncars, who are the original inhabitants of the land. They are great culti vators, but are despised by the Baluchis who look down on them as cowards. They occupy a subject position everywhere. They are sturdy, lively and talkative, and are not nomadic.69 ?*) (b) Kerman .—The population of Kerman town, consists Kerman, principally of Persian Muhammedans (Shiahs and Shaikh's) of whom a few non-indigenous families form an aristocracy, while the remainder are mainly carpet-weavers, shop-keepers and merchants. The number of craftsmen if., carpenters, blacksmiths, etc., is not very great. There are also a number of Tabriz! Turks who, until the advent of the European firms, controlled the carpet industry. There is also a community of Parsls amounting to about 1,'00 who carry on trade, but whose importance in the business world has much declined in recent years. There is also a very small and unimportant community of Persian Jews who are very poor. A few extraneous Armenians, principally clerks and carpenters of Isfahan origin, go to make up the sum total of the peoples of Kerman. The following is a table of the population of Kerman which was in 1902-03, estimated at 50,000. Shl’ah Muhammedans . » . 37,000 Sunni . 70 Babls (Bahai) . . 3,000 Biibls (Azall) .■ y 60 Shaikhls . . 6,000 Sufis . . . y • • . 1,200 Jews .... . y ;.J 160 Zoroastrians (Parsis) . y 1,700 Hindus . . . . • v 20 Total . 49,210 Kerman Province .—The population of the province was estimated by Sykes (1902) as 750,000 and by Newcombe (1905) as i,000,000. It is divided into dwellers in houses and nomads, the latter forming a large percentage o e inhabitants. The townspeople are mostly Iranians, the successive hordes of invaders having almost in e\ery case kept to a wandering life. A list of the Kerman nomad tribes will be found in Appendix A,70 r (e) Bandar Abbas .—The population of Bandar Abbas is about 12,000 souls, but in the summer is not much more than one quarter of that number, the majority of the re mainder goin£ away to the Minab district, where there are extensive date plantations and the climate is somewhat better than that of Bandar Abbas. The inhabitants are a hybrid race of mixed Persian Baluchi, Arab and negro descent and are known as Abbdsis. They are a poor spirited people who lack even the necessary courage to defend their own houses and property. A few years ago, when a raid by tribesmen from the interior was threatened, the people of the town collected all the available vessels they could lay hands on and as many as possible put to sea until the danger was averted. There are about MO Shikarpur Hindus, British Indian subjects, here, in whose hands is about three quarters of the trade of the port, and a small Khojah community. The official language is Persian, but the bulk of the inhabit ants speak a patois almost unintelligible except to them selves. Plenty of individuals however in the town have a working knowledge of Hindustani and would be available as interpreters. The inhabitants of Balban number about 8,000 persons. They are all Baluchis, chiefly of the Rais and Hot tribes. In religion they are Sunnis, and are not in any degree Persianised. They are extremely poor, ignorant and uncivilised. Almost all of them live in date leaf huts, and there is hardly a dwelling of any other kind in the district. The following are some of the chief tribes to be found around Sirjan, Bam and Narmashlr:— Sirjan, Afshars .—Mostly nomadic, liring more especially in Aqta and Khabr. They number about 2,000 tents, but are not much use as fighting men. Friendly to the Buchaqchls. Doragdhis .—Chiefly engaged in trade and friendly to the British. 1 hey number about 2,000 tents, and live astride the road between Saidabad and the Tang-i-Zagh.71 Kihistanis .—Live in the hills between Saidabad and Baharlu country round Darab. Most of them therefore live in Fars, but some are to be found in the Sirjan district of Kerman. They make a livelihood chiefly by robbery and tie carrying trade. They are subject to the Qawam. Buchaqchis. —A nomad tribe living round Chahar GumbaZ in summer and Bagh Khajui in winter. It possesses about MO tents, but few good fighting men. ltd Ulldhi. —A small tribe living mostly in and around Siahr-i-Babak, but having some 100 bouses in Sirjan. They are however practically one with the Khorasanis, who are followers of the Agha Khan, and are therefore inclined towards pro-British sympathies. They are among the best fighting men in this area, and as such are a valuable factor from the British point of view. Khordsdni. —A partially nomadic tribe, living all over Sirjan and to a certain extent in Pariz. 1 he nomadic section numbers about 500 tents, while the settled members of the tribe have about 900 houses. There are about 150 tents of the Khorasani with the Afshar. Like the Ata Ullain, thev are thoroughly pro-British and good fighting men. The tribe has sutfered much from robberies at the hands of the Arabs, but as a rule can keep its end up. Kami .—A nomad tribe of flock-owners, living in summer round Chah Haq and in the Sarchahan valley, and in winter moving a long way down the road towards Bandar ) ms. They do a certain amount of robbery. 1 heir tents er about 1,000. The men are no fighters and have a reputation for bringing bad luck and defeat to any force they are with. Luri .—A nomad tribe of about 500 tents living around Bid Khab in summer and around Tal Ha a in win er^ They are therefore friendly w r ith the Buchaqc is, an ar not hostile to the Kuhistanis. Shul Turkls. —A nomad tribe of 400 tents living in and around Daristan Sirjan in summer and close by near Puzeh Khua in winter. They are enemies to the Buchaqchis, and they pride themselves that, though J they are better fighters, man for man than the B - v' 'Arashlu. — A small nomadic tribe living around Gughar. Claimed by the Buchaqchls as part of themselves. Khajfn. —A small nomad tribe of about 200 houses living around MalikSbad Sirjan in summer and Kuh Khajui in •winter. They do not move far. They are supposed to be enemies of the Shul Turkls. Bam and Narmdskir Shdikhi. —A nomad tribe of about 200 male adults, living in summer near Zahu to the south east of Rigan and in the winter at Chah Degal, about 10 miles to the north-west of Rigan. They are of Baluch origin. Their migrations take place about March and July. Ydglu.—k Shi’ah tribe living around Deh Reza, 20 miles north-west of Rigan. The whole tribe numbers only about 80 males. Bais .—A small nomad tribe living in summer at Kuh Shah between Rudbar and Narmashir, and in winter at Gumbaki, 7 miles north-west of Rigan. The tribe can raise some 40 armed men. Gaavi .—A tribe numbering about 30 armed men, dwelling in summer round Zahu and Dar-i-Kashki and in winter at Deh Gaavi, 10 miles north-west of Rigan. The nomad tribes of Ears, especially the Jabbareh Arabs and the Baharlu, which are described in ‘ Military Report on Persia, Volume IV, Part II \ have an important bearing on the 'western side of the Kerman province, while on its eastern frontier and as far west as Bam the prowess of the nomad raiders of Persian Baluchistan is well-known. The people of Shamil are of Persian race with probably a considerable infusion of Arab and Baluchi blood. The universal language is Persian of a purity which increases with the distance from Bandar Abbas. The people are nearly all Shi’ahs with the exception of about a dozen villages, all further west than Bandar Abbas, which are either altogether or predominantly Sunni. The total number of inhabitants, excluding Bandar Abbas and Minab, amounts to 25,000. The population of Minab numbers about 10,000 in the summer and 7,000 in the winter, and als ( The : large p&lt; Island, date ph lack of proport Jahrum Minab.

The tenets of Babism are no clergy, no prayers, only g- matic belief in God and His manifestations, whether by Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, or Baba’Ullah.74 Climate. lick tan. CHAPTER IV. Climate and Health. (a) Persian Baluchistan. Owing to the great extent of country covered by Persian Baluchistan the climatic conditions are most varied. The coast district of Makran is extremely hot, trying, steamy and unhealthy ; while the further north and higher one goes, the cooler and healthier it becomes. The valleys of the Bampur division are stifling in the summer months, tvhile Bampur itself is notorious for its unhealthiness. Among the highlands of Sarhad different conditions pre vail, and on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Taftan are spots suitable for hill stations, but destitute of supplies. Here the air is dry and bracing, and in winter snow and ice are not uncommon ; in fact heavy snowstorms have been re corded even at Bampur in February. Am ong the moun* tains four seasons prevail, but towards the south, two only -—the cold and the hot. In Makrdn the cold weather lasts from October to April; the hot weather from May to October. The maximum winter temperature on the coast varies from 87 to 94 degrees, and the maximum summer temperature from 94 to 110 degrees. Rainfall is uncertain, but usually occurs between November and February, occasionally continuing into March. The annual rainfall probably averages between 6 and 7 inches, but differs considerably in the various localities; along the coast belt it is never more than three or four. In summer it would be most inadvisable for Europeans to sleep under canvas by day, on account of the heat: while, wherever water exists, mosquitoes and other insect pests abound, making rest almost impossible. Qasrqand is noted for its mosquitoes ; as a consequence malaria is common. Even the poorest inhabitants here sleep under mosquito curtains during the hot months. The heat of Geh is intense between April and October, but the district does not appear to be unhealthy, and the people are singularly free from malaria.75 ^ 1 district k notoriously bad evan T U r tan £ The Lhly irrigated land along the river, or Baluchistan.

(b) Kerman. In Kerman province rain very seldom falls before the climate, middle of November, or after the end of March ihe average number of days in any one month would be three or four only. The average annual rainfall in Kerman city is only 5.6 inches. Floods caused by rain subside in 24—3(5 hours and the ground dries very quickly, hut, where not pure snnd oi stone, it is very slippery when, wet and is then difficu t to inarch over.r 76 The heat is never excessive on the top of the plateau but in mid-summer it might be advisable to march by night rather than by day. In the garmeir it is so hot from April to October that campaigning would be impossible; the nights there, however, are chilly from November to March. There 13 no very extreme cold on the plateau November to March are cold, especially January and -b ebruary ; the night temperature in these two months is usually 9-10 degrees below freezing point. Very rarely temperatures below zero are registered as late as March. Snow usually falls during January and February, but not before or after. Roads are occasionally blocked by it even as low as Bam, but it seldom falls there or anywhere off the plateau. , f. n ^ erm Sn town a prevailing west wind blows almost daily from April to October, raising large and sometimes very oppressive sand and dust storms. On the Sarvistan plain and from Tehrud to Abariq, a high bitterly cold wind b ows all tlie winter. In summer the breeze is cool on the plateau; but down below there are hot winds, which, across the Lut, are intensely and dangerously hot. The only other climatic condition which would interfere vuth the marching of troops, is the melting of the snow in the spring, causing floods in the rivers, which are, however, very seldom unfordable at the places where the main caravan routes cross them.

(c) Bandar Abbas. cZ^. kW ;- „ , T,le °t Bandar Abbas is notorious for its heat and unhealtlimess. The summer heat is almost intolerable,V ovring to the combination of moist air from the stagnant bay in front of the town with the reflected and radiated heat from the mountain wall behind. Even in the depth of winter the mercury seldom falls below freezing point. January and February are cool and salubrious with occasional showers of rain, which are sometimes heavy. In March, April and May the surrounding country dries up and malaria prevails. From June to September the heat is intense and most of the inhabitants desert the town, but fever diminishes. The actual temperature seldom rises above 100 degrees in the shade, but it is the humidity of the air that makes the summer months so oppressive. From October to December the heat is on the wane, but malarial fevers are once more rife. Mosquitoes are trouble some in the spring and autumn. In addition to the malaria mentioned above, which is of a malignant type, other common diseases are:— Smallpox, an endemic, of which there is nearly always an outbreak every summer. Dysentery, which is prevalent towards the end of the hot weather; owing to lack of water in the ambdrs, the residue m them becomes very foul. Eye disease {trachoma), due to lack of personal cleanli ness. Venereal disease, which is estimated-to be present in 80 per cent, of the population. Guinea-worm and kidney disease, which are the result of drinking the polluted water from the wells and ambdrs. Sanitation is non-existent; every street is a drain unto ireelf. A aOband Camp .—The health of Naiband Camp is far from resembling that of Bandar Abbas town. Being three miles away on sandy soil, it escapes contamination, and especiallyrs mce (he new water supply from the covered-m well was “fid the camp has been generally very ftee from d.seasa Orrine however to the exceedingly debilitating effects o« S,™Lp heat on those unaccnstomed to it, combined with the lack o£ fresh vegetables, which are always very scarce, the lops are liable to softer a good deal from dysentery especially and from malaria. There are wells in the town, but the water from them is bad, brackish and conduces to guinea-worm and kidney diseases Ample supplies of drinking water are now obtain able from the 1 camp at Naiband three miles to tbe east. ■Well water in small quantities and slightly brackish is ob tamable at two places near the shore, one and two miles respectively east of the town. This water is taken m and sold in town, and, the supply being so limited, b ' available in any but the very smallest quantities for troops There are ten birkehs, or rain reservoirs, situateo north am east of the town; average dimensions oo feet by dU teet If the rainfall has been normal, these are generally tub m January. Water from them however should never be drm&lt; without being carefully sterilized, owing to contammatioi from surface drainage. In the case of operations on a large scale arrangement should be made for the supply of drinking water eJher b condensation, or by means of a piped supply. latter purpose however supplies could apparently only be obtained from Nehu and Mlnab, a distance of 50 miles. There is a source at Nung, but tliis is liable to contamina tion, and its yield is uncertain. The rain falls in this district from about November 20th to March 20th. During this time average statistics show about 6 inches per annum, obtained by 3 days in November, 13 days in December, January and February and 4 days in March. From 1st November to 1st April, troops marching m the district would experience little inconvenience from the pre vailing temperature ; but during December, January an February excessive cold prevails in the uplands beyond the hinterland and would necessitate the provision of plenty of warm clothing for use at nights. During April anu79 October, the heat would render it unwise to move troops to any extent by day: but the early morning and evening could be utilised for this purpose. From 1st May to the end of September, the excessive heat makes it practically impossible to move about by day or by night, and the climatic conditions are so bad as to render it practically unbearable to Europeans. From May to August the native population of Bandar Abbas migrate to Kuh-i-Ginau or Mlnab, neither of which places are salubrious for Europeans ; but the mountains, tlu; highest peak of which attains an altitude of 7,783 feet, are only 18 miles from the town and should afford a sanitarium. Snow has never been known to fall within the garmslr. The climate of Shamil resembles that of Bandar Abbas, but inland the summer heat is even more intense owing to the distance from the sea and the rejection of the sun s rays from the bare sandy soil. Medical. Kerman .—There is a hospital at Kerman run by the Kerman Medical Mission of the Church Missionary Society under the direction of a European doctor assisted by / men and 4 women, fully trained assistants. The present building is cramped and inadequate but a new ward for 28 beds with kitchen and store rooms is being built and is nearly completed. (1921.) Hen jam .—There is a fully equipped Dispensary (with four beds) in charge of an Assistant Surgeon, I.S.M.D. be longing to the Royal Indian Marine, who looks after the employees of the coal depot and the Telegraph Departmen . This officer is also in medical charge of the men of the garri son, including the detachment at the oil-boring works on Qishm Island. Bandar Abbas.— In the town there is a 2nd Class Dis pensary in charge of an Assistant Surgeon, I.S.M. ., w io is Quarantine Officer for the Port. In the camp at Naiband there is a 5th Class Station Hos pital with 30 beds in charge of an I. M. S. officer and two Sub-Assistant urgeons.80 Jasfc.—There is a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, I. S. M. D. for the personnel of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, who is also Quarantine Officer for the port. For the troops there is a 5th Class Station Hospital with 14 beds in charge of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, I. S. M. D. Chahbdr .—There is a 5th Class Station Hospital with 9 beds in charge of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, I. S. M. D. Under present arrangements this officer also looks after the personnel of the Telegraph Department, which possesses a small dispensary. The Quarantine Officer for this port has lately been abolished.81 CHAPTER V. • Resources. (a) Transport. There is no wheeled transport in South and South-east Transport Persia. Where water and forage are available, the mu]e GoneraL is the best and fastest animal carrying a load of 2 naaunds at 3$ miles per hour. In Eastern and South-eastern Persia, however, the scarcity of fodder and water make the use of the camel imperative. The Persian camel carries a load of 4 maunds. For a comparatively desert country with minimum loads, donkey caravans would be useful, and move quicker than camels. The South Persia Rifles transport officers found that mule and donkey convoys from Bandar Abbas reached Kerman (326 miles), four to five days earlier than camel convoys. Feed for donkeys is 4 lbs. barley and 10 lbs. bhoosa daily, whether laden or not. On this they will carry 2 maunds at 3£ miles per hour. The Persian ration for mules is Bandar Abbas man (9 lbs.) of barley and 10-12 lbs. of bhoosa daily. For employment with his own animals the Persian caravan man is excellent, but when he is merely in charge of animals not his own property, much supervision and tact would be necessary. His endurance and stamina are marvellous and his wants as regards food and clothing very small. He is usually accustomed to handle arms. He treats his animals with great care and kindness. The length of marches is dependent' on the water supply j the first march is always made short, and subsequent ones average about 20 miles ; 30 to 35 miles is not unusual for, a long march. Caravan animals are almost invariably hired out at in clusive ra t es, the owners being responsible for finding all attendance, and for arrangements for watering and forage. This plan is found to work a good deal more satisfactorily than that of merely hiring the animals alone. For equipment, an ample supply of ropes should be brought with a force. The supply could probably be kept 1*301 JGS „83 aould probably be collected, if one month’s notice were given. These numbers would be for hire, not for sale. The in habitants of this district, as of other parts of South Persia, can seldom be induced to part with their animals. The Makran camel carries 5 maunds, and marches 15 miles a day. Marching iS usually done in the morning and afternoon with a rest in between for grazing. The Ham pur camels are small and can only carry about 240 lbs. as a rule. The camels of Rudbar are a particularly good class and able to carry considerable weight. They are mostly owned by the Ilyat Baluch, who breed them, but they are not used to any great extent by their Rudbari owners for caravan work. Being used to the plains they are at first awkward in stony and mountainous country, but soon become accustomed to bad going. Motet of them are bred in the district between the western end of the Jaz Murian Hamun and the mountains, and the tribesmen in this area are frequently found to have herds of as many as 2G0. The principal tribes engaged in breeding are the Shambuleh (or Yar Alunad Khan), the Lurag and the Jausi. 1 he total number of Rudbari camels is estimated at 15,000. Bhoosa and cotton seed are the chief camel foods in this district. In Jiruft there are about 1,000 camels in the possession of the tribes. In 1008 it was estimated that three men could purchase about 3,000 camels in two months’ time in these two dis tricts. There are not many camels in the Narmashir district, and it would probably not be possible to purchase more than fifty. Such as there are are mainly to be found on the borders of the Dasht-i-Lut, and these have the advantage of being used to desert work and of being able to go long distances without water. A considerable number of camels could be collected at Kennan from the surrounding district 29,000 is the wtiinate number of camels in the whole province.UbIm. 84 In the Bandar Abbas area, as in Baluchistan, camels and donkeys are the only means of transport. Previous to the Great War, before the NushkI extension railway to Duzdap diverted so much of the trade with India and Afghanistan, big camel caravans, frequently number ing several thousand animals, used to come down to Bandar Abbas in the winter with merchandise from Khorasan and Afghanistan. This has now almost ceased, and for hiring camels, and (to a lesser degree) don keys, the number available depends upon the state of the trade between Kerman and Bandar Abbas. When trade is brisk, it is an easy matter to collect transport animals, but, when, as at the present time, there is a slump in trade owing to the insecurity of the routes, it is considerably more diffi cult. In the former case 1,000 camels could probably be collected in 2 weeks time during the winter and in six weeks 2,000 should be available. In summer one-third of these numbers could be relied upon. When there is a slump in trade, in 2 weeks in the winter 200 camels is the most that could be gathered, and 1,000 in 6 weeks. Half of these numbers should be obtainable in summer. No transport animals are owned by the local inhabitants, and owners from up-country will very rarely sell them, or, if they are willing, it is only at exorbitant prices. Such camels as have been purchased for Government use came chiefly from Rudbar district. With a month’s notice 200- 250 is the most that could be collected at Bandar Abbas in the wunter time, while in summer the number would be less than 100. , The normal rates of hire for camels are 8 krdns per diem. The camels suffer greatly from surra. In Bandar Abbas, Shamil, Mlnab and Bashakard camels are mainly fed on dates. Mules. There are practically no mules to be found in the area under review, except in the vicinity of Kerman. Such mule caravans as may ordinarily be seen in other parts are invariably found to have come from Kerman and eyond. It is doubtful if more than 300 mules could be ob tained by uire and purchase, using Kerman as a centre.

The rate of hire for these latter is krdns per diem. donkeys .—After the camel the donkey is the most usual Donkey*, method of transport in Persian Baluchistan while in Kerman it is the most usual. In the Sirjan and Kerman areas very considerable num bers could be collected. In Jiruft there are about 800 in possession of the Jlruftls and 1,000 in the possession of the tribes. In Narmashlr they are not so plentiful, the ox being preferred as a means of transport. There are said to be 24,000 donkeys in the Kerman province. The factors affecting the transport situation in the Bandar Abbas area have been mentioned above, and are the same both for camels and donkeys. If the roads were secure, 1,000 donkeys could probably be collected at Bandar Abbas in winter in two weeks time, and 3,000 in 6 weeks. In sum mer one-third of these numbers could be relied upon. hen there is a slump in trade 1,500 donkeys should be obtainable in winter in 6 weeks time, and in summer half as many. The normal rate of hire for donkeys is 4 krdns per diem. Horses .—Horses are little used, and only a few would be Hor»e«. obtainable anywhere except perhaps in Jiruft, where the settled population own about 700 and the tribes l,o00. Oxen .—In Narmashlr a few oxen might be obtained for Oxen, transport purposes, but not more than 500 at the outside. There are probably not more than 2,000 in the district. (For estimate of the numbers of transport animals avail able in the various districts see Appendix B.) (b) Supplies. (a) Persian Baluchistan.—In Persian Baluchistan the Pe[* ia h n istan inhabitants only cultivate sufficient for their own wants, 8 ®p p ii ai , and sometimes, owing to the exactions of Persian officials and want of water, not even that. Until experience has taught that the necessity does not exist, all supplies should be carried, even including forage for animals, as one cannot rely on obtaining bhoosa locally. Crops of wheat, barley, rice, etc., are met with everywhere in small quantities.87 merchants. Fish, generally coarse and not good eating, arei netted in large quantities in the bay. Camel grazing is abundant throughout the year. Grass is unobtainable. Fodder can be brought in from the interior in large quan tities. Fuel is very scarce. i Near Jask the corn raised is barely sufficient for the few inhabitants: a supply might be requisitioned from the Minab' district. Other supplies are practically unobtainable. FisK in limited quantity is obtainable at times. Mangrove for camels can be had, but no fodder for other animals. For fuel brushwood has to be brought from Old Jask 12 miles away, where there are abundant supplies. Plenty of fire wood is also obtainable from the coastal belt to the east as far as Charbar. Bampur .—In the Fehruj—Bampur valley supplies of Bampur. wheat, barley, millet and kurbi are procurable in fair quantities, and a brigade could probably be subsisted in this area for about a month. Elsewhere however in the district little in the waj 7 of supplies would be obtainable. There is good camel grazing all over the district. Dizak.-^As a whole small quantities of any kind of sup- Dizakj plies would be available, though Jalk, Sib and the Dizak valley could probably support a force of a few hundred men. Sarhad .—In spite of its possibilities for development^ Sarha&lt;r, the Sarhad at the present time does not produce enough grain for il* own inhabitants. All supplies, except meat, would have to be imported. Large numbers of sheep and goats should be obtainable. Fuel and grazing are limited. (b) Kerman .—The supplies produced are wheat, barley, Kemin millet, beet-root and peas. In the garmstr, rice and maize 8U PP lles ’ are the summer crops. Many kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown in the province. The most fertile sub-districts are Bam, Narmashir, Rudbar, where there is excellent graz ing, and Jiruft; the richness and fertility of these is im portant with reference to Bandar Abbas. Bam and Narmashir produce considerable quantities of barley, oats and cotton. In a good year the production of the two former is about 250,00O maunds, of which 4,00^88 Bandar Abbas 6 applies. matuids are exported to Bandar Abbas, and 18,000 maunds- to Kerman, the Sarhad and elsewhere. The cotton crop is sown in March and April, and is picked in October and November. It gives a yield of 2,400 maunds of cleaned cotton. The normal crops of rice and dhal are 3 200 maunds and 2,400 maunds respectively. Of these *800 and 1,600 maunds respectively are exported. Jiruft would be the most productive of all the districts hf Kerman province, if it were not for the state of insecuri ty at present prevalent there. At present the annual pro duce in a normal year consists of 80,000 maunds of wheat, 40,000 maunds of barley, 175,000 maunds of bhoosa, 8,000 maunds of dhals, 8,000 maunds of firewood, 8,000 maunda of lice, 100 maunds of milk during the five winter months, 160 maunds of ghi, and 80 maunds of butter. The Jlrufti own 2,500 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats, While the tribes in the district own 1,500 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. There are eight primitive waterdriven mills in Jlnift, each with a capacity of 350—700 lbs. during the five winter months. Practically no packing material is available, beyond the bags used for camels and donkeys. In case of emergency the black goathair tent covers might be used. fc) Bandar Abbas. —Dates, barley and wheat are the main crops. Within a radius of 50 miles from Bandar Ab’ as wheat is rot largely grown. The grain harvest is in April and May, and the date harvest in August and Septem ber. For grinding corn the usual arrangement is by stone band mills in each house. In the surrounding villages •within 30 miles radius there are some 10 water mills whose total combined capacity would be not more than 30 maunds daily. In the town there is one motor driven mill (at present out of order) which can grind 30 bags of grain a day. No crops are grown in the immediate vicinity pf Bandar Abbas.89 During the last six years in the hinterland of Bandar Abbas, and in fact over the whole coast region of South Persia’, there has been a steady diminution in the crops fathered, owing to a succession of years of drought and visits of locusts. So small has been the quantity produced that instead of being able to export grain and foodstuffs, the whole hinterland is largely dependent for its supplies on imports from India. The quantity of these imports is naturally limited, and, were it not for the date crops, which can always be depended upon, things would have gone verv badlv with the inhabitants of this distuct. Large quantities of dates can always be obtained, es pecially at the harvest time (August-September) from the Minab neighbourhood, which has a big export trade in this commodity to the surrounding districts. Bandar Abbas is an importing centre for a large district, including Qishm Island, and the warehouses in the town always contain a fair amount of goods awaiting re-export With a week’s notice the bazars could very Probably meet the requirements of a force of 2,000 men, with followers and transport, for a week or ten da&gt;s. o y ^ longer than this period, or for a larger force, all supphea wr.md have to b i brought from India. Vegetables are scarce and only to be obtained in the winter season, when 100 maunds could probably be supplied. The onl y ™ t f to be procured are limes and water-melons in September and October. These are brought over from Minab. Milk is scarce and mostly from goats. In the summer the supply is practically nil. Fish is abundant in the winter seas , but the supply falls off during the summer months. 1 here is no grazing at all, and fodder is ver y u scarc '’ during October, November and December Bhoosa and barley are stored in small quantaries to meet loca require- ments. Camels graze 14 miles off, behind a ' ’ . , Rud Khaneh, Taz Born, Chah Chakur and Hormundah. Fuel —The nearest coal store is at Henjam Island, and belongs to the Indian Government. Firewood is scared expensive, being practically all imported from Clarence {Strait.90 PeraWa acathod of Note on Persian method of shoeing. Horses and mules are shod in Persia in a manner which, the natives say, gives them the best foothold and protec tion over rough stony passes. The hoof is shortened to the required length with a clumsy cutter and rasp, and a thin plate, which covers the entire lower surface of the foot, except for a circular hole over the frog, is then fitted by cold hammering, and secured on each side by four large nails about 2£ inches long, which are roughly clenched. The plates are not counterstruck and the heads of the nails all project and give a foothold even on sheet rock. This pattern of shoe was tested- by Indian cavalry and transport units and was condemned, because mud works into the hollow parts of the sole being enclosed cannot be properly cleansed and the- sole being enclosed cannot be properly cleansed and thrush is induced. On the other hand, it is pointed out that horses, shod in the ordinary way, are almost inevit ably lamed by the rocks and stones on such roads as those in South Persia ; also, the Persian pattern is exclusively and successfully used by all Persian muleteers, men who spend their lives on the road, and do practically all the carrying trade of the country. British officers travelling in Persia all speak favourably of the shoe, especially for mules, though for horses opinion differs. Taking everything into consideration, it would appear that animals required to work over dry, rocky stony ground would best be shod with the Persian pattern shoe, while those working over wet, muddy, soft ground, or picquetted in permanent standings, which are liable to get damp and foul, should be shod with the ordinary shoe.91 CHAPTER 1Y. Military. British Garrisons .—The distribution of Indian troops is uritighGarris, at present as under:— Dusddp .—One company. Khwdsh .—One company. Chahbdr .—One platoon, under a British Officer, with 1 machine gun and 1 Lewis gun. Jdsk .—One platoon, under an Indian Officer. Bandar Abbas .—One Company, less 2 platoons, with 2 British Officers, and with 5 Lewis Guns. Eenjam Island .—One N. C. 0. and 23 men. Qishm Island. {Bds Takhun ).—One Indian officer and 18 men. The detachments at Hen jam and Qishm Islands are from the battalion which provides all the garrisons in the Per sian Gulf and which has its headquarters at Bushire. The detachments at Duzdap and Khwash are based on Quetta. South Persia Rifles .—The only Persian force of any 8( , oth P0rsift fighting value in Southern Persia of recent years has been Bifles. the South Persia Rifles. Raised by Sir Percy Sykes in 1916 and commanded and trained by British and Indian officers and instructors, they formed an efficient safeguard for the tranquillity of the districts w T here they were stationed and their presence acted as an effective deterrent to the local badmashes who previous to their formation had rendered the majority of trade routes impassable. In the area under review the Kerman Brigade with Headquarters was stationed at Kerman and detachments at Saida bad and Bandar Abbas. It consisted until the middle of 1921 of one battery of artillery, 1 field company of engineers, 1 cavalry regiment, 2 infantry regiments, 1 machine gun squadron, and was entirely self-contained, possessing its own medical, veterinary, signalling and transport personnel. Its strength amounted to 3,200 officers and men with 4 funs and 4 machine guns. It has now been disbanded.92 Penkn Army, Trito. PemUn B«laohiatan. The Persian Government will probably maintain a small force to take its place, but this cannot either in numbers or efficiency provide an adequate substitute for the South Persia Rides in the task of maintaining law and order. At the present time it may be said that no regular Persian Army is in existence in South Persia. The Governor-Gen erals and Governors of the various provinces keep up gust so many irregular troops as they are obliged to by the exigencies of the local situation, but the numbers vary to such an extent that it is impossible to secure any satisfac tory figures concerning these ‘forces.’ The following notes give a guide to fighting strengths in the various districts of South-Eastern Persia. Makrdn .—In Makran almost every male carries a sword, pistol or revolver, even if he is not in possession of a rifle. Only the lowest classes such as fishermen and herdsmen go unarmed. The number of armed men at present in Makran, as far as is possible to estimate, is approximately 6,500. Of these probably one-third have modern rifles. This figure covers the immediate followers and adherents of the 10 leading chiefs, of whom the most important are as fol-. lows:— Piinoiptl Chief. Personal Followers. Total number whicn could be raised in an Din Muhammad Khan 200 emergency. 1,000 of Dashtiari. Jumna Khan of Halt. 200 500 Hussein Khan of Geh. 150 500 Ayub Khan of Bint. 300 500 Mir Hot! Khan of Lashar. 100 iSJ O O Rustam Khan of Cham. 150 400 All Muhammad Khan of 200 500 Sarbaz. Mustaplia Klian of 100 500 Jask.93 In addition to the above, Mir Barkat of Biaban, who is closely allied to Jask, has about 200 personal followers and could probably raise 1,000 armed men in an emergency. As regards the numbers given above of the personal fol lowers of each chief some two-thirds at least would have modern small bore rifles, and the remainder Martini-Hen- rys. Of the numbers which could be raised in an emer gency, about one-third would possess small bore rifles, the remainder having about half Martinis and half ancient muzzle-loaders. Ammunition however is scarce in all cases. Bampiir .—The number of armed men in this area is Bampflr. uncertain, though Bahram Khan’s brother Mir Ali Muham mad, on taking over the stocks of rifles, etc., which came into his possession after his brother’s death is said to have found 800 rifles and two old guns (one B. L.). Dizak .—An estimate of the number of fighting men in Di*ak. this district compiled in 1909 was as follows :— Sub* District. Fighting* men. Armed with modern rides. Diiak ... 1,310 950 Jalk ... ... ... - ••• 525 332 Bampusht ... 1,000 l.^OO Kalaghan ... ... 260 198 Sib 566 510 Ir&amp;fshan ... ... ... 200 190 Magas ... ... ••• '• 220 195 Total 4,081 3,375 According to a more recent estimate Dost Muhammad, late Sirdar of Saravan, who succeeded Bahram Khan ol Bnmpur on his death, had 300 personal followers and could probably have raised a total of 2,000 men in an emergency.94 Sarhad. EarmSn, Uandar Abb5fi. Sarhad .—In 1917 the numbers of armed men in the Sarhad were estimated to be as follows :— Tribe, Fighting Strength. Modern Bides. Bemarks. Eeki ... Damani — 1,000 750 Mostly old Bussian and German rifles. Yirmuhammadzaia 600 350 About 30 per cent. Gamshadzais 300 400 magazine rifles. About 30 per cent. Ismailzais 800 600 magazine rifles. Kurd ... 75 50 ir Balozai ... 75 50 Total 2,850 2,200 Kerman. —The total number of armed men in the pro vince is about 15,000 with some 11,000 riflefc. Of the latter however only about 5,000 are of modern patterns. The tribes are independent of one another, but might combine for a common cause. As a general rule they are not of an y great value as fighting men. The best fighters are the Khorasani and Ata Ullahl, followers of the Agha Khan, and therefore inclined to be pro-British. The Afshars are said to make very fair cavalry soldiers. For details of the armed strengths in the various areas, see summary below. Kerman .—For the armed strength of the Kerman district, see summary below. Bandar Abbas .—The number of armed men in Bandar Abbas town is small, probably not exceeding 400. In a week’s time it is said that 1,000 ill-armed villagers might be collected from the vicinity, but they would be of little military value, and their morale would be negligible.95 In Blaban it is estimated in 1910 that Mir Barkat has 200 personal followers and could raise 1,000 men in an emergency. Blaban and Jask are closely allied. The following gives a summary of the fighting strengths of the various districts in the area under review :— District. Persian Baluchistan-- Uukran ... ••• Fighting men. 6,500 Men with modern rifles. 5,000 Bampar .» 2,000 1,500 Dizak ... 4,000 3,300 Sarhad ... ... 2,800 2,200 Kerman Province— Afshars ... ... 3,000 800 Buchaqohis ... ,.. 500 150 Budbar Tribes ... 2,500 200 Jiruft Tribes ... ••• 2,300 800 Bam and Narmashir ... 1,750 850 Eemainder of province ... 4,000 2,000 Bandar Abbas— Shamil and Mi nb Biaban ... 3,000 1,200 1,000 600 The military ranks in the Persian Army are— 4 Sipah Salar or Commander-in-Chief. Sardar. Commander. Military in the A.my. Both these officers wear on the TculldH a badge of two lions rampant, facing inward, surmounted by the Imperial crown, and have a specially embroidered collar. Amir Tuman, Mir Panj, and Sartip of three grades, all correspond with generals ; the first two have specially embroidered collars ; the sartips have one, two or three etais on gold-embroidered collars, according to grade. ranks Persian96 Persian BaluuauUn, Sarhang, or colonel of Infantry, and Yuz Bashi, colonel of cavalry have specially three stars on a embroidered collar. Yawar, or major, of whom there are two grades, have one or two stars, according to grade, on a gold-embroidered collar. Sultan, captain of infantry and Panjeh Bashi, captain of cavalry, wear three stars of silver on the collar. Ajudan is the Adjutant, and Naib a lieutenant ; of the latter there are two grades, who wear one or two silver stars on the collar accordingly. Tabib corresponds to the regimental doctor. Non-commissioned officers and men are designated as follows :— In the cavalry or savarh, yasaul is a non-commissioued officer of irregular cavalry and savar a trooper. In the artillery dah bashi is a corporal, and tupchi a gunner. In the infantry vakil is a sergeant, sar jug eh a corporal, and sarbaz a private. Military Notes. Owing to chronic unrest for centuries, the whole of Persian Baluchistan contains many forts, almost every village possessing one. These are built of mud, set almost as hard as rock, usually on an ■ eminence, and rectangular in shape, with well-arranged flank defences, provided by towers and bastions. In the centre is the citadel, rising to 40 ft. or 50 ft. in height, and divided into two portions, connected by covered ways. Its plinth is usually filled up to half its height with solid earth, and has a well sunk right through the mound on which the fort is built. The walls of the citadel vary from 5ft. to 10 ft. in thickness, and the entrance to it is always up a steep narrow passage, *a ittmg the approach of only one person at a time. Against the perimeter of the outer wall the houses of the village are constructed, frequently arranged in tiers pre- pared for defence, and surrounded by another loopholed .Trail with flanking arrangements. Loopholed battle-97 ments, 2 ft. thick and 5 ft. liigh, fringe the outer edge of the walls and machiconli galleries are also fre quently provided. The loopholes are usually badly plan ned, and th$ field of fire from them greatly restricted. These forts are commonly built on the edge of a grove near a karez and have a clear field of fire for about 100 yards. The approaches are usually easy, as the date groves afford good cover. Mountain guns are of not much use against the majority. They could, however, demolish the battlements of the towers and* assist the infantry in keeping down the enemy’s fire, while gun cotton was being lodged in a suitable place to blow up the wall or gate. The Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf. The chief place in the Gulf whence there is a small but steady stream of arms into Persia is Koweit, where considerable quantities of .303 service rifles and ammuni tion have been accumulated. These arms are exported from Koweit in two directions. By far .the larger number are smuggled across in dhows to the Persian coast between Bandar Dilam and a point about 40 miles south of Lingeh. Considerably smaller numbers however, are carried overland to Gatr and Dubai on the Arabian coast whence, as opportunity offers, they are sent across in dhows which trade principally between Minab and Chahbar on the Makran coast. Along the strip of coast between Bandar Dilam and Lingeh, during the first nine months of 1920 at least six to eight hundred rifles were landed at various times from Koweit and neigh bourhood. 95 per cent were modern pattern .303 service weapons, the remainder being chiefly Turkish Mausers. Each rifle is usually accompanied by 100 rounds of ammu nition. Besides this large quantities of ammunition are carried over separately and in the period above mentioned amounted to as much as 100,000 rounds. The price of a service .303 rifle ^ith 40-50 rounds near the coast between Bandar Dilam and Lingeh is 40 to 45 Tmnans (120—140 Rupees). i The price of ammunition is 12 Tumans (40 RupeesJ, per 100 rounds. L391CGS98 r r A's regards Persian Baluchistan between the limits already described (Mlnab-Chahbar), though difficulty attends the receipt of accurate information, from reporte received (in September 1920) the number can at least be laid down as 200—300 rifles with some 15 to 20,000 rounds of ammunition, though the latter is probably a good deal less than the actual figure. The prices in these parts are :— For a service rifle and 50 rounds—Rs. 200 to 250. Ammunition Rs. 60 per 100 rounds. (The currency here being nearly all rupees.) A good proportion of these arms are believed to make their way to I ersian Baluchistan, Kerman, and Sistan, and through the last named province to Afghanistan.99 CHAPTER yill Communications. All routes are described in detail in “Routes in Persia Eoad *- Volume IV, Part I.” ’ Railways. The only railway existing in this area runs BaU wa y«. from Mirjuwa to Duzdap, being a continuation of the broad gauge line from Quetta to Mirjawa. It was commenced in 1918 for the purpose of simplifying the communications of the British force on the Trans-Caspian border, and was completed in February, 1919. The length of the line is 52 miles. There were originally stations at Mirjawa, Bug, Khan Muhammad Chah^KachS Road, Lar, and Duzdap. Of these the stations at Bug, Khan Muhammad Chah and Lar have been closed, and Kacha Road was to be shut shortly (March, 1921). They can however be reopened at short notice whenever desired. Detraining Facilities.—Mirjawa. One end unloading ramp. One small high' level platform for un loading animals. Duzdap. One end unloading ramp. Two high level un- loading platforms of 300 feet each for unloading ani mals. Water. —Mirjawa. Water is available both for locomo tive and for drinking purposes. The supply is obtained from the Ladis river four miles from the station. The total supply available in the river, during the dry season, is 57.000 gallons per hour. Of these 30,000 gallons per hour are brought to the station. Of these 30,000 gallons only 15.000 gallons per hour are allotted to the railway. The remaining 15,000 gallons are delivered to the villagers for cultivation, but in emergency can be turned info the railway overhead tank of 10,000 gallons capacity. .100 The pipe line consists of one 12 inch earthenware piping one mile long, delivering into a 400,000 gallon reservoir, from whence it gravitates by two six inch cast iron pipes to the station. Arrangements have been made for the filling of six passenger coaches at a time from overhead piping. There are four hydrants from which passengers can obtain water. The overhead tankage capacity of the station is 10,000 gallons. Ihizddp .—Water is available both for locomotive and drinking purposes. The supply is obtained from three wells joined by a tunnel. The tote! supply is 10,000 gallons per hour pumped into a temporary overhead tank of 14,000 gallons capacity, and also into a temporary overhead tank of 3,000 gallons, which was originally attached to the Duzdap hospital and which is still used by the military. The pipe line is 6 inch cast iron and is all within the perimeter of Duzdap. Between Duzdap and Mirjawa there is no water supply. Water for the staff is carried out by trains and delivered into temporary ground reservoirs, varying from 1,500 to 3,000 gallons capacity according to the staff employed. Telegraph .—There is telegraph communication between Duzdap and Mirjawa allotted for railway use only. Permanent TFay.—The permanent way consists of 75 lbs. rails, British standard section, on wooden sleepers. There is only one culvert of two spans of 10 feet. All the remain ing waterways are met with either dips or small pipe drains. The ruling gradient is 1-100 which stretches practically from Mile 396 half-way between Bug and Mirjawa to Mile 433 (Lar Station). From Mile 433 (Lar) to Mile 436 there is a falling gradient varying between 1-100 and 1-200. From Mile 436 to Duzdap the gradient is easy. Bolling Stock. —There is no stock set aside for the use of this section. Whatever stock is required is obtained ivova the general system of the North-Western Hallway.101 The maximum loading for a single engine on this section U 15 vehicles, or 350 tons, of which two vehicles, or 50 tons, are water tanks allotted to the engine. The maximum for a double-engine train is 30 vehicles, or 550 tons, of which four vehicles, or 100 tons, are water tanks allotted to the engine. The capacity of the section is 8 trains per day in each direction. Possibilities of Demolition. The most vital portions of the railway are the water supplies. That at Duzdap, being within the perimeter, should be safe. The supply at Mirjawa is however four miles away and would need protec tion in case of hostilities. Between Mirjawa and Duzdap there are no places requiring special protection. Two other lines have been surveyed in the area under review t— (1) Bandar Abbas— Minab—Rigan—Kerman. This is said to be the easiest alignment for a railway from the coast to the main plateau of Persia. First G6 miles level, 62 miles up the course of the Minab River, 13 miles over low hills and the Ginau Pass (1,370 ft.), 63| miles over level plain, 30£ miles over the Jabal Bariz range by the Gishu kotal (3,160 ft.), and 42A miles to Rigan practically level. Rigan to Kerman presents no difficulties. The only difficulties would be encountered in the vicinity, of the Gishu kotal. From a commercial point of view this line could hardly, under present circumstances, be a paying concern. (2) Gwatar—Kerman. Length 574 miles with a ruling gradient of 1 in 45. This also could not at present become a paying proposition. Telegraphs .—The chief telegraph lines in Persian Balu chistan and Kerman are :— (1) Bandar Abbas via Tang-i-Zindan and Baft to Kerman (2 wires). Length 274 miles. Inter mediate Station, Baft. (2) Baft to Saidabad (1 wire on wooden polesfc Length 64£ miles. Telegraphs.102 Cables. (3) Land line along the Makran coast from Karachi via Omara, Pasni, Gwadur, Chahbar to Jask, 646^ v including 318 miles on Persian soil (2 wires). This line is connected with cables at Jask and Chahbar. (4) A section of the international line (3 wires) run ning from Ardistan via Nain, Yazd, Anar, Ker man, Bam, then across the Dashb-i-Lut to Shurgaz, Gurg, Nasratabad Sipi, Dehaneh Baghi to Duzdap and the Perso-Baluch frontier and con necting with the Indian telegraph system. Intermediate stations, Anar, Kerman, Bam, Dehaneh Baghi and Duzdap. (5) Duzdap to Mirjawa (1 line), 52 miles. Nos. (1) to (4) belong to the Indo-European Telegraph Department. There is a light military line from Mirjawa to Khwash. 'Cables .—The following are the cables in this area :— (1) Jask to Karachi. 551.6 miles. / (2) Jask to Henjam. 135.5 miles. (3) Henjam to Bushire. 373.8 miles. Nos. (2) and (3) are sections of one of the Jask— Bushire cables. - (4) Jask to Bushire. 520.2 miles. t [(5) Jask to Muscat. 219 miles. { ,'(6) Henjam to Bandar Abbas. 41 miles. '(7) Chahbar to Jask. 160.4 miles. riie distances are of cable lengths and in nautical miles (2,029 yards). All the above, with the exception of (6) are owned by the Indo-European Telegraph De partment. The Bandar Abbas—Henjam cable was built for the Persian Government, but, as it has never been paid for, it is at present in the possession of, and worked by; the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Since103 the money for it is most unlikely to be forthcoming, it can safely be assumed that it will remain under its present control for at least some years to come. y Wireless .—The only wireless station in this area; open wireless, to international traffic is at Hen jam Island and is owned by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. It com municates normally with Bahrein, and only under favour able circumstances with Bushire and Basra, owing to the exceedingly disturbing atmospheric conditions between these places, and to the fact that the apparatus is not of the latest pattern. It is chiefly used by ships in the Persian Gulf as a means of getting messages sent by, cable to India or Basra. The call code is y. T. H. Th§ generator is of 3 Kilowatts capacity. 4 At Bandar Abbas and Chahbar there are pack wireless installations of small radius of action belonging to the Royal Air Force. There are no personnel, however, of that Force in either of the two stations, and the wireless is reserved solely for emergency purposes for aeroplanes which may be passing by this route. There is telephone communication by the Indo-European ^otophone, line between Kerman and Duzdap, with intermediate sta tions at Bam, Fehruj, Kahurak, Dehaneh Bagln and Duzdap. * There is telephone communication between the various stations on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas line. This is used mostly in connection with the up-keep of the lines. In addition to the telegraph station at Baft there are several telephone stations subdividing sections which are too long. It is just possible to speak through from Kerman to Bandar Abbas over this line.

Political. Administration. The Government of tlie country consists of a Shah, a Majlis or elected National Assembly, which rarely sits, and a Cabinet. The latter is nominated by the Shall but m theory must retain the confidence of the Majlis. In prac tice it does not do so, but really governs the country. The country is divided into 33 provinces, under Governor- Generals or Governors. These provinces are divided into districts, sub-districts and parishes, each in charge of officials subordinate to the Governor-General or Governor. Ihe administration is corrupt and inefficient. The dispen sation of justice is always summary, but the Persian Gov ernment has no jurisdiction over foreigners who are tried by their own consuls, except in the case of subjects of countries which formed part of the Tsarist Russian Empire, who are subject to Persian law. (a) Persian Baluchistan has since 1908 been practically independent of the Persian Government, and the various tribal chiefs have been a law unto themselves. In Mekran there are many petty chiefs styling themselves ‘hakims’ in their villages or groups of villages. Said Khan succeeded in acquiring their support, and a reputation for generosity y granting to the local families of BuledI extraction or related to the Buledls freedom from the revenues paid formerly to the Persian Government. From other dis tricts, such as Sarbaz, which was under complete Baranzai control, he never dared claim any revenue. The common people however were taxed by him and his grantees to such an extent that numbers of them migrated to the Gulf Ports or to India, and the majority would have welcomed the annexation of the country by the British. On Said Khan’s death Islam Khan was unable to maintain the former’s hold over the other chiefs, and the country reverted once more t ?- b f ng o a gr0Up of inde P e ndent districts under their own chief s. Some of the latter would welcome the advent of the n isi m oider to put an end to the uncertainty under jyhich they now live, though they would not relish the loss107 of revenue, or of the powers of hukumat which they now enjoy. • Until his death in August 1921 Bahrain Khan was supreme over the whole of Bampur and Dizak. He was hated by the cultivators on account of the crudeness of ms administration, which consisted in screwing as much as he could in cash and kind out of them. The surrounding chiefs too were antagonistic owing to the Baranzals having usurped the power they formerly held. The Sarhad is now divided up between the Damanls, Rekis and Ismailzais, each of whom control their own section of the district and any minor tribes living in it. Prior to 1916 the Damanis were predominant, but as a result of the punislunent meted out to them in that year they are now content to live at peace with their neighbours. (b) Kerman province is ruled by a Governor-General, Kera.n. who has his headquarters in Kerman. There are Governors under him in the various districts, to whom the revenues are farmed out. (c) Bandar Abbas is one of the Gulf Ports and as such B-taibM.. is subject to the Governor who has his headquarters at Bushire. He has under him a Deputy_ Governor at Bandar Abbas, who exercises authority in Shamil and Minab. in Biaban the Deputy Governor delegates his authority to a Kalantar. The islands are for the most part only nominally under his jurisdiction. Miscellaneous. The unit of money in Persia is the kran, a silver coin, the value of which varies with the price of sUver At the present time (March 1921) 3T0 krans are worth Rs. 100. The coinage consists of: Copper Nickel { Pul = in size to Indian pice. Hsed only J . &gt;in Khora- * \ Shdhis—in size to half an anna ) san. •1 1 Shahis—rfo bran.')

These are not in circulation owing to their ever varying silver value. A gold tumdn has a value of 22 krdns. A tumdn in silver is worth 10 krans. Accounts are sometimes reckoned in dinar, an imaginary ^om, the ten thousandth part of a tumdn of 10 krdns. A Kran therefore = 1,000 dinars ; one shdhi = 50 dinars. The favourite coin is the silver 2 krdn piece, often called a gudgdrl by Afghans and Baluchis, this being their pro nunciation of Qdjdri, a name given on account of the image of the Shah on the coin. The Imperial Bank of Persia issues notes which are current in all towns of Persia, though a discount is gene rally charged, if out of the circle in which issued.
