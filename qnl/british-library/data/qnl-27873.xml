The reply is in the affirmative* (^j), This relates to the despatch of air mails from London to Bunder Abbas via Bahrain* The London post office commenced despatching closed air mail bags for Bunder Abbas through the East bound Imperial Airways service which are offloaded at Bahrain* Ine iirst despatch consisting of three such bags was received at Bahrain on the 1st May 1939* These begs are received as closed transit mails advised in the way bills (Feuille d’avis) received by the Bahrain post office from the Imperial Airways and are forwarded to destination by the Bahrain post office inside its own bag, which necessitate their being advised in part IV of the said way bill. This practice is being followed from May 1939 and there has been no change in it since. This shows that air mails Irom London to Bunder Abbas are received at Bahrain by air and from there are sent direct to destination by the next Slow Mail sea service. The sea borne mails from London to Bunder Abbas do not pass through any Indian office of exchange. (iii) The practice hitherto has been that letter mail articles are exchanged with Iran by the Bahrain post office direct and not through the intermediary of the properly constitued offices of exchange on the side of India, viz * Bombay and Karachi, ihe mails are international mails as they are exchanged between two independent countries* Such mails must pass through a spe cified office of exchange. (iv) Parcel post acpounts with Ifcan are always settled direct with that Administration and not through the International Bureau, Berne* Both India and Iran are parties to the Parcel Post Agreement of Cairo, and in disputes of this nature, the parties concerned can invoke the assistance of the International Bureau, for a settlement. In the present case, this has hot been done so far. as Iran may raise the same claim that Bahrain is located m their territory. No other course seems to be opened to this Department for recovering the amount from the Iranian Administration. It may be mentioned in this connection that in addition to 14.75 gold francs due to India from Iran for 1936, further sum of 3.50 and 17.40 gold francs for the years 1937 and 1938 respectively are also due on the same account. The information for the year 1939 is not yet available. Para 4 of the Ministers letter* The Minister’s presumption is correct. Further enquiries made in the matter have also shown that Iran does not send any parcels to Bahrain direct destined for parcels beyond Bahrain.INDEXED FILE COPY / 6615 • i I940 / 14 ’DEC 1 4i&gt;C5 Telegram XX.

Before reaching any definite conclusion in this matter 1 should be grateful for further information on several points which are not clear to me. .Thile these points are be ing examined I see no reason, in view of the attitude of the Iranian Government towards British passports bearing endorse ments for Bahrein ana even Kuwait, why Bahrein should not continue to return to Bandar Aobas parcels for Bahrein which authorities send tnere direct, instead Bomoay or Karachi to be forwarded, which I should be grateful for information the Iranian postal of sending tuern to 3. The points on are as follows;- ti) Am 1 to understand from the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Your Lordship's express letter under reference that Bahrein is considered part of India for postal purposes? (ii)In his telegram Lo134 of the 27th September Sir H. Seymour reported that the Iranian Government were complaining about mails in general, and not only about parcels. The Director General of the ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that there had been a cnange in the practice as to the 'fsuilles d'avis'* accompanying mails from London to Bandar Abbas via Bahrein. Have there been any such changes, or was the Director General perhaps trying to draw a red herring across the x track owing to his inability to produce a convincing answer on the subject of parcels? liii) it is not clear from paragraph 6 of your express letter under reference what the position of 'ordinary inter national mails, including registered mails' has been in the past, in the first place, does 'international mails' in this context mean simply mails which are international because they pass between two separate countries, namely, Iran ana Bahrein ? Am I to understand that letters, whether registered or not, b&amp;nnot be exchanged direct between Iran and Bahrein, but must travel via India unless I give an opinion in favour of direct exchange? 7/hat has been the practice hitherto? liv) How are accounts settled between the Government of India and the Iranian Government for the conveyance of mails, terminal charges, etc.? I imagine that each has a claim against the other, and that whichever owes tne other most eventually remits a draft for the balance. Is trie Government of India in a position, under whatever arrangements exist for tne settling of accounts, to recover the 14.75 go la francs due for 1936 in spite of the objections of the Iranian Government? But even if there were a balance in favour of the Iranian Government, which would be necessary to enable such action to be taken, it may be contrary to the terms of the Parcel Post Convention of Cairo for disput ed char ores to be levied without reference to the central authority in 5 Switzerland. 4. Tnese queries are based on the assumption that in Your Lordship's express letter under reference you are referring only to parcels for Bahrein, and not for parcels destined ior places beyond Bahrein which are sent there for onward transmission.

Subject;- Exchange of letters and parcels between Iran and Bahrain and between Iran and Muscat. I a;- directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your despatch :o.21 (222/3/40), dated the 19th February 1940 and to enclose an extract of a note dated the 1st June 1940 recorded by the IndianFosts and Telegraphs Department giving the information on the various points mentioned by you. 2. in this connection I an to state that the Muscat post of Tice which is also under the Indian Posts and Teleigraphs Department has been exchanging both letter and pare el Inails with Iran for a long time. This oractice has been irregular as the mails should have passed through Bombay or Karachi which are the Indian offices of exchange. As in the case of Bahrain, the Iranian Administration have not been affording the ter #mal dharges due to India on parcels sen . by Iran to Muscat direct, unfortunately no account of the charge due under this head has been kept. It is desirable to regularise the position and there seem to be two alternatives - ti)~ to maintain that Muscat, like Bahrain, possesses no post office capable of exchanging international parcels and the t parcels for Muscat should therefore oe sent sqc to Bombay or Karachi for re-fo rwarding; Ui) to agree to Iranian parcels being xorwarded to Muscat only^if the Iranian government agree to pay the terminal ch£ rges. 3. in view of the serious delay involved 'ey tie adoption of the first alternative and the fact that the Iranian Groyernment shadowy claims to regard inhabitants of Muscat as Iranian subjects are much less stressed than their claim to Bahrain, it is possible that theyjnight agree to the 2nd alternative, if, however, you consider that they are unlikely to ao so, the only course open seems to be, as in the case of Bahrain, to adopt the first alternative. The G-overnment of India would be grateful for your views on this point. 4. As regards letter mails sent direct to Muscat from Iran there is no objection to the present practice being continued as the opiestion of terminal charges does not arise. Dopy of a note dated the 1st June 1940 recorded oy the Indian' Posts and Telegraphs Department. Information regarding the several points raised my the Minister, Teheran, in his'*letter dated the 19th February 1940 is given below ser ia tim;- Para 3 (i). The reply is in the affirmative.

Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke to me on September 26th about Bahrein postal service. He gave me gist of communication from Indian i^stal Administration to the Iranian Post Office in which it was explained that Bahrein possesses no Post Office capable of exchanging international mails and that therefore mails from Iran - which are shipped from Bander Abbas - should be sent to Karachi or Bombay for reforwarding. Director-General went on to explain that whereas hitherto mail from London reaching Bander Abbas via Bahrein had been accompanied by 'feuille d’avis' of the General Post Office, London, only recently Bahrein had been sending its own ,, feuille d’avis” as well.

'O * ■J • /V c. f* / 06 /\ From the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the xternal Affairs Department, New Delhi, To His tilajesty's ? inlater, Tehran (Repeated Secretary of State for India). SUBJECT:- Bahrain Postal Service. Reference correspondence ending with our telegram No. 53, dated 25 th October 1939. 2, The position is as follows The post offices at Bombay and Karachi are the two offices constituted for the exchange of parcels between India and Iran, while the Bahrain post office has not been so constituted. It appears that during the last three years the Iranian post offices were irregularly sending parcels to Bahrain, instead of to Karachi or Bombay, for onward transmission (? to Bahrain), and, on these parcels, the Iranian Administration was affording only sea conveyance charges to India and no terminal charges which were due. This irregularity was pointed out to the Iranian Administration by the Superintendent, Foreign Posts, Bombay, in 1938* but that Administration replied that no terminal charges were due to India because tae locality of Bahrain belonged to Iran. The Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department then took up the matter and the Iranian Administration was requested to forward all parcels to Bombay or Karachi, instead of to Bahrain, and also to afford the terminal charges on parcels to India. It was also pointed out to the Iranian Administration that the Bahrain post office was net In a position to correspond with foreign administrations. 3* According to Article 3 of ihe Parcel Post Agreement of Cairo, the administrations of origin and of destination of a parcel are allowed to collect a fee for the conveyance by land of the parcel. This is called tne land rate, territorial charges or terminal charge. As stated above, the Iranian Administration has been refusing payment of this terminal charge on parcels / sentsent to Bahrain on the ground that the locality belonged to Iran. 4* j.he question of terminal charges arises only in the case of parcels, and the number of parcels concerned is only about 6 a year, ihe wotal amount claimed by the Indian Posts and Telegraph® Department for terminal charges in 1936 is 14.75 gold francs. Ihe matter, therefore, is at first sight a very petty ono, and it is only becanoe of its connection with the Iranian claim to Bahrain that it is necessary to give it a very careful consider- ation. 5* There appear to be three courses open:— (i) To maintain the attitude that Bahrain possesses no post office capable of exchanging international parcels, and that parcels from Iran which are shipped from Bandar Abbas should, therefore, be sent to Karachi or Bombay for re-forwarding. (ii) To agree to the Iranian parcels being forwarded to Bahrain only if the Iranian Government agree to oay the terminal charges. (ill) To agree to the Iranian parcels being sent to Bahrain as before and forego the recovery of terminal charges. The objection to the second course is that it might raise the Bahrain issue in an acute form, which is presumably most undesirable in present circumstances. The objection to the third course is that it may lead the Iranians to think that we are giving way on the questibn of Bahrain and give them an argument to support their claim if it is ever examined in an international court. In view of these objections the Government of India are inclined to adopt the first course, but would be grateful for your views. 6 . It can be argued in support of the first course that the Bahrain office is a small one In charge of a sub-postmaster, on whoru tue responsibility of exchanging foreign parcels, maintain ing an international account, and corresponding with a foreign fiowlvXr^ m §§ s cafrfIS h lu? e a? f Ba£fa?n r Xo there are no terminal charges to be recovered on these and orders will be issued on receipt of your reply. Pending further consideration of the case, orders have been issued to the sub- /postmaster ^sub-postmaster # Bahrain, to refuse to accept parcels from Iran and return them to the Iranian postal authorities. It will be necessary for such parcels to be sent to the foreign offices of exchange at Karachi or Bombay. 7. The Government of India will also be grateful if you would do what you can to recover the sum of 14*75 gold francs claimed on account of terminal charges for the year 1936. There will be similar claims for subsequent years as soon as the exact amounts have been calculated. If, however, you feel that these claims cannot be pressed without raising the whole Bahrain question in an acute form, you will no doubt inform the Government of India accordingly and perhaps consult His Jla^esty’s Government - before taking action. 8 .

(222/3/40) Vy Lora .ftr^ueas, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Tour Lordship 1 a express letter ??o* D»3569~K/89 of the 19th January on the subject of the exchange of letter** and parcels between Iran ana Bahrein* 2. Before reaching any definite conclusion in this matter I should be grateful for further information on several points which arc not clear to me* While these points are being examined I see no reason, in view of the attitude of the Iranian Government towards British passports bearing endorsements for Bahrein ana even Kuwait, why Bahrein should not continue to return to Bandar Abbas parcels for Bahrein which the Iranian postal authorities send there direct, inetead of sending them to Bombay or Karachi to be forwarded, 3* The points on which I should be grateful for information are as follows♦- (i) Am I to unaerstand from the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Your lordship*?* express letter under reference that Bahrein is considered part of India for postal purposes ? (ii) In his telegram No, 34 of the £7th September Sir a. Seymour reported that the Iranian Government were complaining about malls in general, ana not only about parcels. The Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that there had been a change in the practice as to the *feuilles d*avis'* accompanying mails / fro* His Kxcelleney2 - fpos London to Bandar Afcfc&amp;s via Bahrein. Have tnex-e been any auch changes, or «ns the director General perhaps trying to draw a red herring acroas tne trade owing to his Inability to prodace a convincing answer on the subject of parcels ? (Hi) It is not clear froa paragraph 6 of your express letter under reference what the position of '’ordinary intemationfU ^aila, including registered mails'* has been in the pfiat. In the first place, does ''inter national mails’ in this context wean simply wails which are International because they pass between two separate coontrieo, namely, Iran ana Bahrein ? Aza I to on-er st and that letters, whether registered or not, cannot be exchanged direct between Iran and Bahrein, but must travel via indie aniens I give an opinion in favour of direct exchange ? vhat has been the practice hitherto ? (iv) Ho* art^s accounts settled between the oovenusent of India and the Iranian Govemiaent for the convoysnea of isailB, terminal BfeMgSi# ?tc. ^ i Imagine that each has a clniis against the other, mx&lt;X that whichever owes the other most eventually resits a draft for the balance, la the Government of India in a position, under whatever arrangements exist for the settling of accounts, to recover the 14*7b gold franca due for 1936 in spite of the objections of the Iranian Government 7 But even if the*** were a balance in favour of the Iranian Government, which would be necessary to enable such action to be taken, it may be contrary to the terms of the areel ;o»t Convention of Cairo for disputed charges to be levied without reference to the central authority in Gwitnorland.3 t 1940 J These queries ere baaed on the assumption that in Your Ijorcship’s express letter under reference you are referring only to parcels for Bahrein, and not for parcels destined for places beyond Bahrein ^hleh are sent there for onward transmission* I have the honour to be* / Wra karquess, Your lordship’s jK&gt;at obedient, humble Servant, (Hgd) *'Uliards Sir, ./ith reference to ihe correspondence ending with your u.o. communication No*G-*P* 92 dated the 6th November 1939, i am directed to say that the existing practice of the Bahrain Post Office exchanging parcels direct with the Iranian Administration is irregular and should be stopped immediately.

The position is as follows:- The post offices at Bombay and Karachi are the two offices constituted for the exchange of parcels between India and Iran, vftiile the Bahrain port office has not been so constituted. It appears that during the last three years the Iranian post offices were irregularly sending parcels to Bahrain, instead of to Karachi or Bombay, for onward transmission, ana, on these parcels, the Iranian Administration was affording only sea conveyance charges to India and no terminal charges which were due. This irregularity was pointed Iranian Administration by thi NlOo. POL, a?, f P Superintendent/ ••• {Designation) s. 44. “ ' MFP-—1813BftP—(M-2617&gt;— 214 &lt;S ^gg| ; ^ OFFICE |(ii)/ •.

The Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department then took up the matter and the Iranian Administration was requested to forward all parcels to Bombay or Karachi, instead of to Bahrain, and also to afford the terminal charges on parcels to India. It was also pointed out to the Iranian Administration that the Bahrain post office was not in a position to correspond with foreign administrations. b. According to Article 3 of the Parcel Post Agreement of Cairo, the administrations of origin and of destination oi a parcel are allowed to collect a fee for the conveyance by land of the parcel. This is called the land rate, territorial charges or terminal charge. As stated above, the Iranian Administration has been refusing payment of this terminal charge on parcels sent to Bahrain on the ground that the locality belonged to Iran. 4. The question of terminal charges arises oply in the case of parcels, and the number of parcels concerned is only about 6 a year. The total amount claimed by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department for terminal charges in 1936 is 14.75 gold francs. The matter, therefore, is at first sight a very petty one, and it is only because of its . . - it connection with the Iranian claim to Bahrain that^is necessary to give it a very careful consideration. 5. There appear to be three courses open:— (i) To maintain the attitude that Bahrain possesses no post office capable of exchanging international parcels, and that parcels from Iran which are shipped from Bandar Abbas should, therefore, be sent to Karachi or Bombay for re-forwarding.(ii) To agree to the Iranian parcels being forwarded to Bahrain only if the Iranian Govern ment agree to pay the terminal charges.

Exchange of ordinary international mails, including registered mails can, however, be carried out at Bahrain as there are no terminal charges to be recovered on these and orders will be issued on receipt of your reply. Pending further consideration of the case, orders have been issued to the sub-postmaster, Bahrain to refuse to accept parcels from Iran and return them to the Iranian postal authorities. It will be necessary for such parcels to be sent to the foreign offices of exchange at Karachi or Bombay. 7.

Six Persian merchants have written a combined letter to the Sub- ost Master datea the 8th February 1934 in the following terms:- ^we have been given to understand by our Bushire constituents that they have not received letters posted to them by the last mail.' ,f As some ol these letters contain drafts and other documents we shall reel obliged if you will Kindly let us Know if you have any miormation as to why and how these letters have been delated.' 3. The regulation covering letters posted with foreign stamps in an Imperial Post Office would seem to be Paragraphll0(3; of the Posts and s. 8.Telegraphs Manual,Volume V,which runs:- '(2). Postage stamps of foreign countries and Indian States, including the overprinted stamps referred to in tne preceeding vjDaragraph.should not be recognised in payment of postage or other postal charges on articles oosted in Imperial post off ices,mail oflices,sections or letter boxes. If an article so posted bears only such stamps,it should be treated as wholly unpaid,the stamps being ignored. The stamps,however, should not be defaced,but a remark,drawing attention to the fact that they are those of a foreign country or Indian State, should be written on the face of the article or section of posting. Indian State postage stamps in addition to those of the'Indian Post Office are sometimes affixed to articles intended for delivery in an Indian State. The Indian State postage stamps should not be obliterated but the other stamps should be defaced in the usual manner.' 4. Ordinarily,! should have advised the Sub-Post Master to proceed on the analogy of the above uoteu regulation,but to do so may at once raise with the Persian Government the question of the Bahrain stamps (and so perhaps the status of Bahrain). 5. There appear to be two courses which can be pursued (a) The first would be to proceed on the analogy of the Regulation quoted in Paragraph 3 above and for the Sub-Post Master to demand the recovery by the Persian Post Office of double the postage on the grounds that the stamps affixed are those of a foreign country. This can,however,only be done if His Majesty’s Government are prepared to fight the question,if the Persian Post Office refuses to recover the amount. (b) The second course is to allow these particular letters to go through without any endorsement on the envelopes and without any demand for the recovery of the amount due; and at the same time for the Sub-Post Master to place a notice on the notice board couched in the following terms 'The Public are informed that postal articles cannot be accepted for transmission,if they bear stamps other than those bearing the surcharge ’Bahrain’.' 6 . i would suggest that no answer be returned to the letter of the merchants and that,if they pursue the matter,they should be referred verbally to the above notice and informed that,as an act of grace,their letters have on the present occasion been forwarded without penalty.A 3 . I should prefer the course of proceeding precisely on the analogy ol the regulations (though at the same time issuing the notice menti in Paragraph b above),but I appreciate that it may be expedient at the present juncture to avoid raising the stamp question in an acute form. The matter is one of some urgency as the letters have been detained,but delay is inevitable if the course to be adopted involves a reference to His Majesty T s Government. If,however,you consider that the course outlined in Paragraphs 5(b) ana 6 above sufticiently meets the present case please telegraph me the one word 'TASTE'.

It, will he remembered that the Sheikh of ago Bahrein seme time/asked that the Indian postage stamps at present used in his state (which is served 'by an Indian post office under the control of the Government of India) should (as is at present the practice in Koweit) be surcharged ' , Bahrein ,, . It was agreed that this proposal should be approved and the Universal Postal Union were notified of the forthcoming issue of surcharged stamps towards the end of last year. The Persian Government, on receiving a circular notification from the Universal Postal Union on the subject, protested to the minister, who recommended unostentatious delay in their issue to avoid an acrimonious discussion'. He was apprehensive that the Persians might regard the issue of the stamps as an infringement of the status quo arrangement in the Gulf. 3* totters rested at this point until the early part of this year, when, consequent on a formal protest by the Persian Government to the Universal Postal Union, which was circulated by the Union to all States members, ano in the course of which they reiterated their claim to Bahrein, it was agreed that_ a reply on the lines approved in our letter to the Foreign Office of 23rd February, on P.Z.777/33 flagged, should be sent. Sir H. Hoare subsequently recommended (P.Z.2021/33) that the stamps should be issued without further regard for Persian susceptibilities. This proposal was accepted by H.lt.G. and the Government of India, and the Minister authorised to proceed accordingly. 4/ -4. Prom his letter to Mr. of 1st June, on P.Z.3959/33, it will he seen thut Sir H. Hoare, who had postponed acting on the instructions given to him, has now rather changed his mind and is anxious to let sleeping dogs lie unless this would form the subject of adverse comment in the Gulf. Both the Government of Inula and Colonel Powle strongly urge, however, that the stamps should now he issued without further delay and it is relevant in this connection that so long ago as April the Political Agent, Bahrein reported that the delay in their issue 'has become subject of some local comment and issue would be appreciated locally'. 5. I suggest that we might support the views of the Resident and the Government of India. £ven if negotiations are resumed they are unlikely to be concluded rapidly and the delay may become considerable Secondly, having regard to the international correspondence which has passed, our position may to some extent be weakened if in effect we yield to the Persian claim that these stamps should not be issued. Finally, the Minister, from his letter of 1st June, paragraph 2, does not apparently think that the Persian reaction will be very serious - 'They will be peevish about it, but they will get over it in time.' 6.

That statement having been made we consider that delay in the issue of the stamps would be interpreted not only by Persia but also by other members of the Postal Union as an admission that we are not altogether certain of its correctness.

We do not agree with Fowle that issue should take place without previous warning being given to the Persian Govern ment, but hope that the warning will be given soon so that the Persians may have as much time as possible before negotiations are resumed to get over the peevishness anticipated by Hoare. The issue of the stamps will not of course be authorised until a decision is taken. Copies of this letter are being sent to Lalthwaite and Fowle. Yours sincerely, Sd/- W.K. Fraser-Tytler. V.A.L.

Personally, I am against any further delay in the issue of these stamps. Originally both the Government of India (vide their telegram Wo.2319, dated the Iflth October 1932) and I ( vide my telegram Wo.633, dated the fith October 1932) agreed to postponement provided it was clear that the postponement was only temporary and that Bahrain retained full discretion to issue any postage stamps it liked when it pleased. 3. ’’lie Persian Government 1 * protest and claim to Bahrain (made in connection with the proposed issue of the stamps) was given publicity in the circular dated 26th January 1933 issued by the Pirector, International Bureau of the Universal ^ostal T nion. His Majesty’s Government decided that a reply should be sent through the medium of the ^ostal Authorities in India, that this claim was entirely without fo udatlon, which was accordingly done, 19^ ^e letter W 0 .36-Kis/st/31, dated the 24th March 1933, from 33 the Pi rector General of ’’osts and Telegraphs, India, to the director, International Bureau of the Bniversal Postal Phi on.

To my mind the letter of the Persian Postal Administration to the International Bureau was deliberately provocative and I expect that good rather than harm will result from showing our readiness to take up the challenge.* I entirely agree, and cannot help thinking that any further postponement of the issue of the stamps may be taken as a sign of weakness on our part by the Persian Covemwent and the Shaikh of Bahrain. f Tie issue of the letter of the ' irector General, Boots and ’elegraoha, India, quoted in the preceding para graph, would seem to furnish an additional reason against postponement. 5. In paragraph 2 of his despatch quoted above Hoare suggested that - before the issue of the stamps - he should make an oral communication to the n ersian Minister for Boreign Affairs* but in his demi-official letter under reference he explains that this communication has not been made. In the circumstances it might perhaps be better tactics for the stamps to be issued forthwith without any cosmiunicatlon be ng made at all to the Persian Govrmment? 6 . It was pointed out in my letter No,826-3, dated the 31st October 1932, that - in epite of the threats of the Persian Government - there were no practical difficulties in the/3 OS the way of leeulng the etampe.

Your telegram 11 T of April 21st about the surcharged Bahrein stamps is on my mind now that I am on the point of going on leave. I was unwilling to act on the lines agreed upon while the Anglo-Persian Oil Company business was still unsettled and with the passage of time my unwillingness has grown - exactly why I find it difficult to say, though partly because I really think that with treaty negotiations in the air the original proposal to surcharge the stamps was a mistake. It is true that I did not protest, but having only just arrived I did not realize that the matter was of any importance. There is no doubt that if their present mood lasts, the Persian Government and the Shah will want to get on with the treaty when I get back in the autumn. I f m not particularly hopeful that we shall achieve anything, but even if we won 1 1 I am rather inclined to believe that a 'state of negotiation' is not as unsatisfactory a situation as we have sometimes thought, by which I mean that the Persians are rather less likely to provoke incidents if they are negotiating than if they are not. 2. If therefore Bahrein can bear to wait in the hope that we shall get Persian recognition of her independence in the autumn, I favour waiting; but if to wait would make things definitely difficult for Loch and Gastrell, then I think we must talk to the Persians as agreed; they'll be peevish about it/ H.A.F.

To my mind the letter of the Persian Postal Administration to the International Bureau was deliberately provocative and I expect that good rather than harm will result from showing our readiness to take up the challenge. 2. If you concur, I would propose to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs orally that his Department (he was abroad when the note was sent) had presumably noticed firstly that I had not answered the vehement note summarized in my telegram No. 151 of October 12th and secondly that the stamps which formed the subject of that note had not yet been issued. He must have concluded, if he had seen the papers on the subject that in both cases our inaction v/as inspired by a desire to avoid controversy. It was to be regretted that the Persian Government had not followed our example, but had deemed it desirable without even reverting to the matter with me to address to the International Bureau the communication repro duced in the circular No. 653/23 of January 26th. In the circumstances, it had been inevitable that His Majesty s Government/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.3.I., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office.Government should take steps to rebut the Persian claim to Bahrein and this had been done. Moreover, in view o^ the action of the Persian Government it had been decided not to defer any longer the issue of the surcharged stamps. It was, of course, not for me to attempt to dissuade the Persian Government from penalizing letters bearing these stamps, but it would be unfriendly not to tell him that, so far as I could learn, practically the only persons who would be inconvenienced would be Persians established in Bahrein and their correspondents in Persia. 3.

Please see previous submission on P.Z.373/33 ana the correspondence circulated to the members of the Universal Postal Union on the subject of ’the • proposea issue ol British Inaian stamps surcharged Bahrein on P.Z.777/33 below. It is important from our point ol view to maintain the status quo in the Gulf am ( while negotiations are in abeyance^ the balance of advantage seems to rest at the moment with doing nothing which coula justify the Persians in e.g. challenging our position at Henjam. But while in these circumstances it is probably undesirable actually to issue tne stamps to which the Persians object, it seems important not to allow this further affirmation of their view of the status of Bahrein to go unchallenged, more particularly in view of the very wiae publicity which will be given to it among states quite unfamiliar (in all probability) with the history of the dispute. The Foreign Office, with whom the question has been discussed, entirely share this view (see JPr. Warner’s letter below). ^• The balance of advantage is at the same time thought by the Foreign Office to rest with sealing with the question on a purely postal, as distinct from a diplomatic, basis, and in these circumstances tne simplest course appeared to be that tne Director General 01 Posts and Telegraphs in India should reply to the circular letter issued by the Bureau International in terms to be approved by H.L.G., and the Foreign Office have now suggested a formula. • ihey attach some importance to immediate action and wish to send a copy of whatever communication '&gt; -v 2 . conrnunic&amp;tion we send to the Governnent of India to lx.

No corrrnunication to this effect has, however, been made to the Persian Government, nor has any action yet been taken on the protest addressed by that Government to the League of Nations on tne present subject. It appeared preferable to H.M.G. to suspend any action until the political situation arising from the unilateral cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession was clearer. 2. The receipt of the circular letter of which a copy is now enclosed from the( Bureau ^Internationa| of/f of the Universal Postal Union necessitates considerat ion of the desirability of any longer leaving unchallenge cl tne Persian I assert ions on tne subject of the status of Bahrein. Ana this is more particularly so in view of the wide publicity which will be given to the circular in question. The terms of the Persian note, in the absence of any contradiction, might well produce a very unfortunate impression on states unfamiliar with the history of the Bahrein dispute;. 3. Subject to tiie’ views of the Government of India ana of the h Linister at Tehran, to whom a copy of this letter is bein^ sent by the Foreign Office with a_request that he will communicate a^-root on the mutter the Government of India, H.m.G. are disposed to think that some reply would be desirable. Tney are further disposed to think that it would be preferable that the matter should be dealt with on a postal rather than on a political basis; ana that the simplest course would be that, if no objection is seen, the competent Postal authority in India (presumably the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs) should write to the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union with reference to the i Persian/Department. Persian letter circulated in the Union’s circular letter No.653/25 of 26th January/€hat, since Bahrein is not Persian territory and consequents the Persian Government have no right to nictate what stamps the Sheikh shall issue, the Sheikh, at whose request a British Indian post office has for many years been maintained in Bahrein, is within his sovereign rights in requesting the Government of Inaia to arrange for the issue of stamps surcharged as now proposed. 4. If the Government of India, in the light of Hr. Hoare’s remarks, concur in the action proposed, I am to ask that they will cause the necessary steps to he taken and will send a copy of any communication which may he addressed to the Bureau fnio Cliice and to ...L, Minister at Tehran. ^THWAITE.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 22nd February, 1933.

Our Legal Advisers suggest, however, that as regards the actual phraseology of the proposed letter to the Union, it would be best, rather than saying that the Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent ruler and reserves his rights to J.G. Laithwaite, Esqto issue what stamps he wishes, to say that Bahrein is not Persian territory and that consequently the Persian Government have no right to dictate what stamps Bahrein shall use* You kindly said that we might see your draft to the Government of India and that you would get it off in time for us to send a copy to Hoare next Thursday (tomorrow), asking him to telegraph his views to the Government of India and to repeat his telegram to us.A ^£•5310/782/91. 102798/52.

But this is of relatively small importance and a formal answer could be sent to it if and when it- i s found ne-c-essary to a-pprove the intro auction-of the—-surcharged ups anu-^bo ignore the -Persian s^sntatrions. _ L&lt;KaM CO CLA t~ 29a 2000 5.31No* 483, I 273 B ^ itl#h L&lt;igation ’ 7 DEC 19 32 j Tehran* ember 9 1952* 1 ° Slr 9 The Political Heaident in the Persian Gulf has sent me a copy of his despatch No* 327*3* of October 31st to the Government of India on the subject of the threat of the Persian Government not to deliver letters bearing Indian stamps with the surcharge 'Bahrein'• 2* In view of the very definite Information in this despatch that the only persons who would be inconvenienced if this threat were carried out are Persian merchants established in Bahrein, I have the honour to suggest that no answer be returned to the note from the Persian Government summarised in my telegram No. 151 of October 12th, and that the issue of the new stamps be deferred until it be seen whether the general negotiations have failed or not* Should they fail, I suggest that I be instructed to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs orally that I am not replying to his note and that the stamps are being brought into use forthwith* I advised him as a friend to tafce note of the fact that the only persons who were likely to be inconvenienced if the threat of the Persian Government were carried out were Persian subjects in Bahrein and their, presumably, Persian correspondents in this country. 3 * I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India (No. 234) /and The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C*3*I*, ete* 9 etc*, etc*, The Foreign office.and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire,(No» 199)* I hay© the honour to be with the highest respect.

On that paper it was agreed that,in tne interests oi avoiding any possible charge by Persia that by approving the issue of these stamps we were violating the Status ^uo Agreement in the Persian Gulf, the issue of the stamps should oe unostentatiously delayed and that the Persian Government should be informed that CSu issue ms being suspended,our action ms entirely without prejudice to tne rights of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Before any such communication had been made to the Persians it appeared that the Persian Government had made a formal complaint to the/the heague of Nations. The Foreign office X were still disposed to reply as originally ^ proposed, a copy of the sense of any such reply being communicated to the League in reply to their circular letter. L. Since then relations with Persia have markedly deteriorated. The Department in the first instance suspended any reply to the Foreign Office letter of 9th November PZ68&lt;r*(? until it could be seen how our discussions with the Persian Government over the question of Henjam would result. If, as seemed at one time not impossible, they resulted in a very definite breach or in/strained relations, the arguments for meeting Persia half-way even over so small an issue as the present would have been greatly weakened. If, on the other hand, they improved, we could make additional play with any such action as a mark of the friendliness of our dispositions. Since then there have been the Anglo-Persian developments. In the light of these I have discussed with the Foreign Office the desirability*of taking any action until the atmosphere is clearer. They agree thut we need do nothing for the moment. The issue of the stamps has, of course, been provisionally suspended.n CONFIDENTIAL, No. 827-S of 1932. p/zt 7065 193 2 The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to / His Msgeety’s Secretary of State for mala, i^ondon, wo. 827 His Majesty’s Minister, xehrar, wo.

The real difficulty is aouotless as Sir II. seton suggests ^that thejff^TSgard the issue of a special Bahrein stamp, auly notified internatially through the Postal Union, as emphasising Bahreini independence of Persia. 2- The Foreign Office were duly informed that we agreed with the views of the Government of India on this subject. But the situation has now undergone a change, for the Foreign Office have heard privately irom the league that the Persians have submitted a formal protest (as to which the league were anxious for advice as to whether the Foreign Office or India Office should be addressed). 'Trie Foreign Office have replied indicating that tne communication should be made to them/them, hut in view of the Persian move they now propose to consider the whole mutter further on receipt of the Persiun protest.

Previous Papers :— A, — v '/1212 5 (.00 9.32 Minute Paper Department Please see previous submission on P.Z.5090/32 about the introduction of postage stamps over-printed ’’Bahrein” for use in Bahrein. An Indian post-office has been established at Bahrein since about 1904 and the stamps hitherto used have been ordinary Indian stamps without any surcharge. In Koweit, on the other hand, where Indian stamps are also used, they are used with the surcharge ’’Koweit”. As will be seen from Mr.Hoare’s telegram of 12th October the Persians have protested against the proposed surcharge in the case of Bahrein. They may be unaware of the existing position, but one would have thought that the surcharge had the advantage/of emphasising that we do not regard Bahrein as British territory. But they may, of course, take exception to anything which emphasises its independence of Persia. The Government of India’s views are given in yuur of 18th October. I understand demi-officially from the Foreign Office that they are prepared to instruct Mr.Hoare on the lines proposed by them. I submit that we might inform them that we support the Government of India’s views and concur in action on these lines. IcuXL 22* X -TiCOPY P.

In these circumstances, 1 recommend the request of tne Bahiein Government for the favourable consideration ol the Government of India and trust the necessary sanction will be accorded, to the surcharge of stamps for sale in Bahrein. At present the Post Office at Bahrein obtains its supply of postage stamps from the Post-master, Karachi. In the case of the surcharged stamps the same procedure can he adopted, the Post Office, Bahrein receiving its supply as required from Karachi.
