Omitting the articles mentioned in the previous paragraph the value of imports and exports for the last two years has been as follows:- Imports, Exports 1942 - 43. 1,80,28,990 1,16,11,650 1949 - 2,91,04,750 77,76,490 These figures which include considerable transhipment and re export cargoes, show an increase in the value of imports of Bso 1,10,75,760 and a decrease in the value of exports by Ss. 38,36,160. Sources of trade . The principal source of Bahrain's imports is India whose share of the total imports decreased by 14% as compared with 1942-43. The shares of the United Kingdom and United States of America on the other hand showed a decrease of 3% and an increase of 688^ respectively. Imports from Arabia show an increase of 30^. The increase in the value of trade cannot however be attributed to an all round improvement in trade, but was due to an increased quantity of imports by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and of cereals by the U.K.C.C. There was however a distinct improvement in local trade between Persia and Bahrain.(B) FINANCIAL -TIuiiTNKGS OF uQN^Y &gt; Money remained extremely tight during the year 1943 - 44* Indian Funds were being sold in the bazar at 4^ discount until the beginning of 1944 when the rate fell to 1^ discount. iSxchanee* The average sterling-rupee rate of exchange for the year was Ss. 1,338 per £ 100. liarvos The date crop was unusually good. During the year under report there was an increase of cultivation of vegetables by small holders. Industry. The pearl catch was a little less than the previous year. Due to activity on the Indian market prices of lower grade pearls rose considerably over 1942 - 43 prices. Development of mines . The figures below will give some idea of the development of the oil fields:- Quantity of oil shipped from Bahrain for the fiscal year ended 31st March 1944 - l f 095,844.346 tons. Total production of oil for the same period - 882,923.626 tons. Quantity of crude oil received from Arabia and refined in Bahrain - 686,103.299 tons.

The freight charges in respect of general cargo were as follows!- Bahrain to Karachi 29 rupees per ton. Bahrain to Bombay 29/8/- do. Bahrain to Basra 25/- do. Bahrain to Persian Gulf ports 5s. 32/8/- per ton. Lighterage . There are a number of sea-going dhows with cargo capacity of up to 40 tons each. There is a marked increase in the craft available in this area. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., Ltd., Bahrain had ten steel barg -.s with average capacity of about 180 tons during the period under review. Moreover the British Indian Steam Navigation Company maintained twelve cargo boats with an average capacity of about 25 to 30 tons. State \r i. ^ roads .

Light cars 342. Buses 53. Lorries 110. Social - Standard of living. The standard of living remains low. An increase in wage rates barely offset a slight rise in the cost of living.mmmm - 3 - ^P^QY' At the end of the year under report there were 2286 Bahrain subjects and about 800 other Asiatics in the employ of the Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain, in addition to 181 Europeans and Americans# Public health and hygiene.

During the year under review- there was a considerable increase in the number of vessels calling at Bahrain, as compared with the previous year. The value of imports was higher than the previous year chiefly due to increase in local trade between Persia and Bahrain on account of high barter values. The figure of exports was higher than that of last year which can be attributed to more exports of specie by the Oil Company to Arabia, and exports of Persian and Iraq currency notes to Iraq.

The increase in the value of imports may be attributed to more commodities being available for export from Manufacturing Countries.
