December 5th 1932. My Dear Belgrave, I am writing to you about a matter which I should address to the Political Agent but not knowing him, Prior having already left I believe, I am addressing it to you and trust that you will be kind enough to pass on the request to his successor. The matter is with reference to relief measures which it is thought might be instituted in connection with our service aircraft between Basra and the Musendam Penxnsula. I believe I am correct in saying that there are three Government sloops always on duty in the Persian Gulf and it is thought that if their positions were obtained and passed on to the captains ox our aircraft while passing through Bjahrein, in case of emergency they would be able to call to their aid the sloop which should be in their near vicinity. If the Political Agent will agree to provide this information, I wonder if }ie would be good enough at the same time to agree to our communicating with any one of the sloops in cases of such emergency, in which case would he kindly provide me with their names, call signs ^or wireless purposes and their normal wavelength.

In some cases the damage seems to have 'been wilfully caused hy natives or water fauna such as crocodiles, but in several instances it appears to have 'been the result of contact with the propellers of launches and steamers. 3- In this connection the Company have suggested that Local Authorities should 'be asked to issue a warning to shipping with a view to precautionary measures 'being taken during the navigation of areas used 'by Imperial Airways' flying 'boats, in order to avoid collision with the mooring 'buoys. 4. I should 'be glad if you could arrange for the matter to 'be taken up with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You may also consider it desirable to inform the Government of India at this stage although the flying 'boat services have not yet commenced to operate across India and the complete marine facilities have not yet 'been installed.

With 17 aircraft based on Kasferit. 11 services each way per week between C'. iro and India, With the inception of Stage Tvo, the B .O.A.C . will cease to be responsible for* the Cairo-United Kingdom sector which will be taken over by the Transport Command. There will presumably be connecting services to and from the United Kingdom. 6. No tiae-tcble for these stages is yet kno^n to the B.0./-C., as they depend on when the new base Is established and when the extra aircraft are obtained. (They assume that the n ew t^ase will be in operation before the six extra planes, but the reverse may easily occur). It is the present intention, however, t hat Stage Three should be reached by the end o_f this year. 7. /.Iso, details of the fiu:l destination of all the services l; ■ in India are uot yet known. They depend on where aircraft in Indie are to be centred. The figures given for stages Two and Three above f re be bed on the assumption that all planes vvill go to Calcutta,/-- 3 - » Calcutta, but some, at least, of the services may terminate at Karachii in that event the numoers or services ^iven for those two stages (7 and 11 respectively,) might be increased# 8« in addition, the land planes are to be increased to two services each way per week, and D.C«3»s a_re to take the place oi Lock iteeds. it is not known when this will happen. The- proposal is that all the Bunderlands shall nijht stop at 3chrain^wnich has, I understand, a much better stretch of water for them to land on than Basra; they are 25 per cent heavier than «C Class' planes. If this proposal is accepted, Sunderlands would probably normally not land at Basra at all. It is also proposed that eastboand Sunderl^nds should go 1'rcm Bahrain-Jiwani-Karachi (cutting out Dubai) ^nd westbound from Karachi-Dubai-Bahrain ^cutting out Jiwanl). 10. The proposax referred to in the previous paragraph will eventually mcc n tnat there will^be three Sundei'lcJids ni^nt ^stoppin^, &gt; t Bahrain every day of txie week and a fourth on one day. It is pos; iole that, nith the lend planes v iich are also to ni^ht — here ^ stop actK^OLKaciai, there might be one night per v&lt;/eek with as many as six night -stops at Ba hrain. The T! C Class' ,:ic.nes will con tinue on their present time-table and will not night-stop here. 11. These proposals, of course, raise a number of problems or Bahrain, of wuich the first is acconuiiodation ana the second is food. As regards the former, the B.O.A.C. are negotiating with the iirain petroleum Company for a part of the Compcny's garden which lies between the /ir Liaison Officer*s house and the B.O.A.C. jetty, and blue prints are already being prepared, in r_egard to foo_d, figures of their reiuirements supplied to me by the B.O.A.C. are surprisingly small. They are under examination, but it may be taken, as r* gards meat, eggs and other commodities for which we depend upon exports from Persia, that they will not affect the figures given in paragraph S /-i ^ c o 0 2 of your telegram No. T/713 of September 11th to Foreign, which had? already taken a considerable expansion into consideration, B.O.A.C ! s and that it should be posbible fctf MWfaP/ requirements to be met from the Bahrain market provided we obtain the extra quotas of tea and sugar for which v^e have asked» i^lso, their compara tively small demands of cereals, sugar and tea could be provided from Bahrain's quotas so long as we get them. A certain amount of tinned provisions will of course have to be held in stock here aga inst an emergency. I told the Assistant to the Regional Director and the Traffic Superintendent accordingly and Informed them of the food position in Bahrain. 12. I apologise for an excessively detailed and hastily dictated letter^ but I i.antea this to catch the 'Resang', , hich sails f__irst thing tomorrow morning.

With regard to advising the Authorities at Bahrein officially concerning the proposals, it appears that, as we are a subsidiary of the Air Ministry, the proper and most satisfactory procedure would be for me to write to the Air Liaison Officer,R.A.F., asking him to advise those concerned. I am doing this and I hope it will meet with your approval.

I myself travelled from Bahrain to Sharjah on the 15th of this month in close proxi mity to three of the passengers of whom exception appears to have been taken and their behaviour called for no comment whatso ever. In fact they were better mannered than many Europeans with whom it has been my lot to travel. This may have been exceptional but since it has been placed on record that the conduct of certain Indian passengers from the Oil Company was objectionable it is desirable that it should also be placed on record that the conduct of certain other Indian employees of the same status from the same Company was unobjectionable. 3. I do not grant priorities in Bahrain but I do make recommend ations for persons whom I consider worthy of consideration to the Priority Boards in Hew Delhi, Baghdad, and Cairo. I have no doubt that you do not wish to burden your Station Managers or your Captains with the unpleasant necessity of declining to accept passengers but I do not see why I should undertake this duty on your behalf. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company who are agents for various shipping lines have so far not asked me to undertake similar duties. I discussed this question with your Station ?ianager today and I have told him idxtow that priorities aside^for of course they are the responsibility of the priority Board ; it would appear to me to be a matter for his decision regarding the carriage of other m ^nbers of the public, but in order to avoid as far as possible any unfortunate incident occurring I am perfectly prepared to give him advice in doubtful individual cases.

Harvey by your service on the 7th of February. 2. There were special reasons why it was desirable for the luggage of this individual to be searched by the Customs authorities before his departure. particular care was taken by the Censor to issue specific directions on this point to the Director of custoias who has assured me that he was especially careful to ensure that his officials were present on your pier before the time notified by your office on the 7th of February. I understand that on their arrival they found that the employees of your Corporation had actually embarked the passengers in the aircraft with complete disregard for the rules and regu lations in force in these Islands. 3. It is apparent to me that the present arrangements for the enforcement of Customs and censorship regulations are inadequate and I propose to discuss with the Bahrain Government forthwith the introduction of additional measures which I trust will ensure that the evasion of the rules will be less likely to occur. Order No.5 of 1944 has been amended to make provision for the adequate punishment of individuals aiding and abetting the contravention of clauses of that regulation.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire •ymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.S., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To: His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent Bahrain. Sir I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sulman has instructed me to write to you on the subject of the cessation of n G n class flying boats which will apparently result in local air services between Bahrain, Iraq and Karachi being discontinued for an indefinite period. His Highness is disappointed and gravely concerned by the failure of the B.O.A.G. to maintain the air services between India end Iraq upon which the people of this State nave come to rely when travelling on coDmercial business and for other reasons. The cessation of the air service and the immense difficulties which are encountered by persons who wish to travel on the B.I. steamers will render Bahrain almost inaccessible. This is a matter which will seriously affect the pearl industry as the pearl merchants and brokers are compelled to travel constantly between Bahrain and India. His Highness wishes me to remind you that from the very beginning he has always done all that was possible to assist Imperial Airways and then the British Overseas Airways Corporation to establish themselves in Bahrain and has facilitated their work here and he considers that even a temporary suspension of the air service to and from Bahrain should have been avoided and that due regard should be paid to the needs and the interests of the people of his country. His Highness now regrets that the American air service which is established in Saudi Arabia does not operate in Bahrain. 2/ Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT,&amp; - E - His Highness would like immediately to open negociations with Air Misr or any British air line which is operating in this locality with a view to inducing another Air Company to inaugurate an air line connecting Bahrain with Karachi, Iraq and the Gulf ports. His Highness is not disposed to become dependent on the Tate Air Line but would prefer to see some other British air line undertake the Gulf services which until now have been provided by British Overseas Airways Corporation. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,EXPRESS LETTER . From: Political Agent, Bahrain. To5 Political Resident, Bahrain. N o.c /34, Dated the 7th of January, 1947. Reference correspondence ending with your Endorse ment No.1223-3 dated the 30th December, 1946. I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from the Bahrain Government. 2. There is no doubt that the gap in communications caused by the cessation of the ♦c 1 Class will be seriously felt, particularly because of the paucity of shipping. This break is looked upon as failure of the British to fulfil their unwritten obligations to Bahrain and its people, it is quite true the shaikh has done a lot to assist air facilities in Bahrain, even to the extent of presenting a portion of the f!uharraq landing-ground, and I fully sympathise with his reluctance to allow Bahrain to become dependent on a non- British Air-Line. Further, J appreciate his pro-British attitude. r;: 3. The situation as I see it is that in 1946 His Highness agreed to amendments to the Civil Air Agreement, and under the new paragraph 4 he ceded to His ajesty f s Government the right to grant on his behalf to foreign aircraft the use of the aerodrome for special purposes. It was not at that time contemplated for a moment in Bahrain that 'is l/ajesty's Government wouldpermit a non-British company to take over local passenger and freight traffic. In any case the reservation was made that His Highness would be previously informed of the arrangement made, vide Residency Express Letter No.391-3 dated the 5th April, 1946. I request, therefore, confirmation that, in fact. His Majesty's Government have given local air carrying rights to Tata Air Lines or All India so that I can inform the Shaikh officially. 4. I understand that the British Overseas Airways Corporation have notified the Bahrain Government concerning the transfer of traffic on this route to one or the other of the above mentioned concerns. This is in contravention of paragraph 5 of the Civil Air Agreement and I request that B.O.A.C. be so informed, and asked,as regards the air transport facillties ior Bahrain, to address me and not the Bahrain Government direct. 5*, I n addition to the complaint made in the enclosure to this letter, the shaikh has spoken to me on the subject, and also Abdulla bin isa has represented the matter. They would both like an air-line to be based on Bahrain and from the air-passenger lists only it is patently clear that local passenger traffic is sufficient to warrant the continuation of a regular Persian Gulf Air-Service. T suggest that this should be entrusted to a British Company under inclusive charter to the Bahrain Government. This might be on the lines of the A .I.O.C. charter service, and I Dequesfc authority to inform the Bahrain Government that they may make enquiries. Sd./- A.C. GALLOWAY ATTESTED .

By 'inclusive charter' I mean that a charter or contract is given to an aircraft company, or corporation, which under the charter provides the aircraft, the pilots, the ground staff including the managerial staff etc., etc.. In return the company ply the aircraft to specified places under conditions of lift, load, etc. which they lay down. 3. Regarding the point that we, and not the Bahrain Government should conduct the negotiations, personally I don't see how we can do it. We should have no position unless we negotiated on behalf of His Majesty's Government. I think it would be better for us to instruct the Bahrain Government, but a point which occurs to me is that possibly B.O.A.C. should invite the co-operation of a purely British company in maintaining a Persian Gulf feeder-service. One gathers that B.O.A.C. consider that they have a monopoly for Bahrain, but this indeed is not so in fact. They have an established position, but this does not give them the right to transfer good-will earned over a long period of years to * a non-British concern. 4. •c* Class has already ceased and it is most unlikely that it can be re-started, and unless B.O.A.C. can make satisfactory arrangements early to carry passengers and freight under British auspices, they will increase the bitter local disappointment at the sudden cessation of the public carrying service which they have operated for some dozen years. They will not only have let the public down - I am speaking for. the Bahrain Agency area only - but will have driven travellers to seek passages with foreign lines. Travellers are already using T .W.A. and I hear that in the quite near future K.L.M. are to re»-commence their passenger service using Dhahran. I think, therefore, that either the Bahrain Government or B.O.A.C. should commence^to institute a Gulf feeder-service and this could well be on the lines I have already suggested. vours sincerely. ^at once to negotiate with a British concern Q C.J. felly, ., 0.

The position is that the only services which we operate to Karachi at the present tirae are the U.K./Hong Kong and U.K./ Sydney services which are almost invariably filled with through load, and the best that can be hoped for is the occasional seat. 3. priorities issued by your Agency are only effective as far as Bahrein is concerned, for example a priority 2 on our waiting list would get away before a priority 3, but have no bearing at the service itself, the priorities on which are controlled by London for seats ex U.K. and thereafter any load which may become available is free for each Station on the route. 4. There is still no news of the Air-India Karachi/Jiwani/ Sharjah/Bahrein/Basra/Baghdad service but our Area Manager is due at the end of the week and it is hoped that he may have some news. NS.Mr. Lee tells me that he has suggested to his headquarters that they should start a special flying-boat service from the U .K. to serve places between Cairo and Bahrain, and that he thinks this suggestion will be adopted. The service will ordinarily terminate at Bahrain but until Airindia get their proposed Gulf service going it may be continued to Karachi. 2. Mr. Lee also states that Airindia contemplate using Dhahran instead of Bahrain, and he suggests that the Bahrain Government should themselves endeavour to arrange an air service between Bahrain and Dhahran. 3. It is for consideratj«)n whether we should address the Government of India urging the use by Airindia of Bahrain instead of Dhahran.

In that case there would be no necessity to invite Airindia to use Bahrain. 3. Should the new flying-boat service not materialise, I am disinclined at this stage to support a request to Airindia to land in Bahrain.

I wrote to you on 2nd January (Ext.8590/46) enclosing a copy of the Political Resident's telegram No, 1463 and now e ncl ose a further telegram expressing the iated 8th January ) serious concern of the Bahrein Govern ment at the failure to maintain local air services. 3. We have left you in no doubt as to the importance we attach to ensuring adequate means of communication in this area, with particular reference to the oil developments now in progress and contemplated. Vve hope that you will be able to put us in a position to reassure the Political resident and the Bahrein Government and should be glad to have a statement of the present position at a very early date, 4. We understand that in recent years a matter like this would have been dealt with, in the first instance at least, by the Middle East Air Transport Board in Cairo, which was in a position to assess needs within the Middle East area and to allocate resources in accordance with those needs. We are not sure whether the M.E.A.T. Board still functions, and, if it does, what its views are as regards this question of the Persian Gulf traffic. If this question has not been dealt with by the M.E.A.T. Board, would it not be advisable that it should be put to the Board (if it still exists) v/ithout delay. ? 5.

Deer Donaldson, V i y\ Your letters of 2nd and 16th January, under references Ext.8590/46 and Ext.92/47 respectively, have remained too long unanswered. I much regret the delay but we are confronted with a difficult problem to which there is no easy solution. 2. I am afraid there is no prospect of continuing the 'C' Class flying boat service, which hitherto provided facilities for the carriage of passengers in and out of Bahrein. As you probably know, this was the so-called 'Horseshoe' service, and the 'C' Class flying boats used thereon have been in service for nearly 10 years. They have reached the end of their useful like ior lack of spares, and much as we regret their withdrawal, it is technically impracticable to keep them going any longer. 3, We are now examining with B.O.A.C. whether, and to what extent, the gap, so far as Bahrein is concerned, can be filled. The Hythes which operate a thrice weekly service to Australia, a once weekly service to Singapore and a once weekly service to Hong Kong, all pass through Bahrein, and there will be no difficulty in arranging for them to carry Bahrein mail,- both Eastbound and Westbound. 4, To find capacity for passengers to and from Bahrein, however, is the difficulty. The Hythe services primarily serve Australia, I alaya and Hong Kong, and because the demand for passenger accommodation far exceeds the available capacity, the wnole of the 22 seats with which the Hythes are equipped are filled with end to end - traffic. 5. Whether it will be possible to allocate some of the space for local traffic in and out of Bahrein at the expense of long haul traffic from end to end of the routes, is at least doubtful, but we are giving the question close examination, and will write again as soon as possible.

Major oil development is going on in this area now and rapid expansion may be expected in the future.

His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, BAHREIN. ^ . B.O.A.C. SERVICE Dear Sir, ~ Since the BOAC has discontinued the use of ■' ^ its 'C' class flying boats in its local service, without substituting other planes, the Company has experienced extreme difficulty in the normal movement of its personnel. Examples of the difficulties encountered are as follows 1. Usual routing for employees and their families proceeding from the United Kingdom to Bahrein is by sea to Egypt and then by air to Bahrein. The last party to proceed by this route, numbering thirteen, were forced to remain in Egypt for fourteen days before the Company ^ was able to arrange their onward passage by TWA aircraft. A further party numbering eighteen is now en route to Egypt and the Company expects to experience similar delay as its on carriage from Egypt has not yet been arranged. 2. On occasion, it is possible to arrange for charter aircraft to move parties such as the above, but unless the capacity of the particular craft can be utilized both to and from Bahrein, the resultant cost per passenger is excessive. 3. Thus far the Company has been able to move its personnel from Bahrein to Cairo but since this movement has been on an 'as available' basis, no forward planning has been possible and generally the passengers have been sent out early to ensure making connection in Egypt with resultant increases in lost time and costs. 4. Eastbound aircraft have generally been filled to capacity, resulting not only in the difficulties in moving personnel from Egypt as mentioned above, but also in making it virtually impossible to move personnel to India by air. In mentioning the difficulties experienced by the Company, no criticism of the local office of the BOAC is intended as this office has been entirely co-operative and&amp; ■ ! ot No. C/PA-274-. • - 2 - 16th February, 194-7 has done its utmost to take care of the Company's needs. However, the Company will appreciate any representations which you may deem advisable to make toward improving the local air service for Bahrein. Yours very truly, R. M.

Due to the cessation of the 'Horseshoe' service a vacuum in air passenger transport has been created in the Persian Gulf. 2. B.O.A.C. are being pressed to fill this at least as regards long distance passengers, but there is little hope of their doing so for inter-Gulf service. Bahrain Government are of the opinion that possibly a British Co^many would undertake charter for flights between Basra, Dhahran, Bahrain, Sharjah (and possibly on to India). Approximate lift figures for 1946 and 1946 respectively are ex Bahrain Eastward 319 and 736; Westward 1986 and 1312. Sharjah Eastwards 132 and 92; Westwards 245 and 260. Arrivals 1945 and 1946 respectively were Bahrain 2,355 and 2,119 and Sharjah 697 and 655o 3. These figures are fairly accurate I hope for embarkation and disembarkation, but I cannot guarantee that there is no overlapping since in many instances I have no means of knowing ultimate destinations or points of departure of travellers. 4.

I am told that the H.A.F. propDse to leave only a maintenance party of one officer and 20 men on kuliarraq and that after that only refuelling facilities will be provided for civil aircraft at that aeroarone. On an average aoout 30 civil aircraft are using the aerodrome per month. It appears that neither the ii.A.F. nor the B.O.A.C. will willingly'undertake responsibility for the servicing of the aerodrome . Except in the wilds of Arabia the local Government is ordinarily responsible lor the upkeep and servicing of ciiil aerodromes in its country . Is there any possibility of the Bahrain Government taking over the Luharraq aerodrome ? If not do you think we have adequate grounds for protesting to His Majesty's Government against the proposed reauction of H.A.F. strength on Luharraq? 4. I am taking the file concerned on tour with me and should ^e grateful if you would telegraph to me as soon as possible your views on the points raised in paragraphs 2 and 3. C. J.

Colonel llay informs mo^tha B.O.a.C . have now agreed to operate from early in May, once weekly, a flyingboat service between the United Kingdom and Bahrain with once weekly shuttle service betv/een Bahrain and Karachi# ihe Bahrain-Karachi section will have to be flown non -stop as the creek at Dubai is not deep enough for the Plymouth type flyingboat which it is proposed to use. There'was, however, basis for the rumour you mentioned at my excliange of visits with the Shaikh for Colonel Hay adds that Tatas propose to operate a line to Basra shortly calling at oharjah. The route betv/een Cairo and Bahrain is not yet decided, but an intermediate call will be made at either Basra or Abadan. The decision will depend on traffic requirements. 3. I am also informed that a firm called 'Skyways' London can provide a DC-3 aircraft immediately based on Basra for maintenance and available to operate regularly uasra, Bahrain, Karachi or elsewhere as required, ihe rate would be 10 shillings a mile, but if the Bahrain urovernment made an arrangement with Skyways for a local air service, that Government would be expected to make all the arrangements for the booking of passengers, recovery of fares, etc., and the Company would axpect to be paid its charges for miles flown. 4. In view of the proposals of B.O.A.C. and Tatas riescribed in paragraph 2 above, I should be glad if you would let me know whether the Bahrain Government is interested in the 'Skyways' arrangements.

From His Majesty^ Government's point of view there would seem no advantage in pursuing Skyways proposal now that we have managed to persuade B.O .A .C. to restart service and it would be unfortunate if such a charter service were operated to the detriment of B.O.A.C.

My dear Play, Would you please refer to your d.o. letter No•C/lO dated 22nd January, 1947 about changes in air services passing through the Arab States of the Persian Gulf? 2* We took up this matter with the Ministry of Civil Aviation who in turn have been in touch with B.O.A.C. It appears that the Ministry of Civil Aviation were under the impression that B.O.A.^s local representa tives kept the political authorities in the Gulf fully informed of material changes in the Corporation's services. The Ministry therefore were apparently unaware that the Karachi-Sharjah service had been inaugurated, and no other information had reached us here in the India Office before the arrival of your letter. We now understand that the Karachi-Sharjah service was in fact withdrawn on 1st February, having operated only three return flights. 3. B.O.A.C. have expressed their regret that you were not informed of the inauguration of this service, and say that they have now taken steps to ensure that in future you are given prior notice of all changes in their services passing through the area under your jurisdiction. I trust that you will have no similar cuase for complaint in future. Yours ever, E.P.DONALDSON. The Hobble Lieut.-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E. D.O.No.C/108.

Statistics obtained locally confirm that there is no public demand for the shuttle service between Bahrain and Karachi. This is due to the introduction of the fast mail steamer service and the improvement of mail steamer services generally. 3. From the political angle air communication between Bahrain and Trucial Coast ranks first and present shuttle service which overflies Dubai does not provide this. High priority political passages between Bahrain and Karachi can be obtained on through services. 4. It appears unlikely that Indian or Iraqi air services in the Gulf can be introduced at an early date and there is unlikely to be demand for these air services ms long as fast mail steamer services operate. 6. Provided no deterioration in mail steamer service is likely I feel that we cannot repeat not object on political grounds to withdrawal of shuttle service. = GALLOWAY = CONFIDENTIAL .

Accordingly, the 39F Service arriving here on Wednesdays terminates at Bahrein and departs for U.K. as a 40F on Thursdays at 1050 hours LST. The 39F Service arriving here on Mondays proceeds to Karachi as a 41F on Tuesdays, returns to Bahrein as a 42F on Wednesdays and departs for U.K. as a 40P the same day. 3, Our allotments on these services have also been revised and with immediate effect Bahrein will hold 26 seats to U.K., 2 seats to New York, 4 seats to Basra and 12 seats to Karachi each week.

Parker, Esq., British Overseas Airways Corporation, Bahrain.kr. Lloyd raylor, divisional iJuporintenlent, British uversens Airways Corporation, cnlled to see me this morning. He stated thrtflae^ anticipated increas'ng their services very shortly and that they proposed that no ni^ht stop should be made in Sahrc in, but the TH; st-Bound service would halt for two hours in the early morning and the West-Bound for two hours in the aiternoon. L'hus it would only be necess' ry to provide passengers with b^ekiast and tea. r Iowever, he considered that arrangements would have to be made to cater for emergency night stops and thrt the maximum number of / persons who would have to stay at night and be rationed would not exceed 200. 2. i made it clear to Mr. Lloyd Taylor that the British Overseas Airways Corporation would have to import food stu'fs to meet their requirements and thnt they could not be supplied from Bahrain. Meat and fish would probably be available 5 the latter all the year round and the former in adequate quantities in the winter, but they must also be prepared to be rationed as far as meat ^s concerned during the summer months. m other words, they would kxy( have to cater for themselves to the same extent as the ^oyal Air ^orce do now. 3. Mr. Lloyd Taylor said that he had gre^t visions of the future and considered tht Bahrain would become one of the principal air ports of the Sngland - Australia Pvoute after the war. He visualised a very large concrete, landing ground the preparation of which would involve suction dredging and the raising of the present surface of Moharraq Island by at least two fee® He also foresaw the provision of a marine base at Moharraq instead of at Manama as at present and the building of adequate first class hotel accommodation for a very large number of passengers. He suggested that the scheme should be put /in-in hand aiLmost. im/nGdiaa 'tely so as 'to bo prepared 'to + resume peace-time services as soon as war was over ana he asked what, the channel of c on /nun ic at ion with the Bahrah Government would be. 4. j . said that he would no doubt make his repre sentations to the Headquarters of his own Company and that they would approach the political (Authori ties in the Persian Gulf through the India Office.
