Section 2. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received November 7.) (No. 322.) Sir, Jedda, October 24, 1933. ' WITH reference to my despatch No. 305 of the 3rd October, regarding the strained relations at present existing between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to inform you that upon receipt of the Acting Chief Commissioner at Aden's telegram of the 18th October to the Colonial Office, reporting renewed fighting in Najran and the capture of Badr by Zeidi forces, I at once sought an^nTterview with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who happened to be on a visit to Jedda, in order to obtain what further information on the situation he would be willing to impart. T took the step of approaching the Minister of Finance, notwithstanding the return of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs from abroad, owing to the latter's absence in Riyadh, whence he was not expected to return for at least ten days and in view of the necessity as it seemed to me, of bringing my information, from Saudi sources, up to date as early as possible. I saw Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman on the 19th October, and reported to you the gist of his remarks in my telegram No. 179 of the same date. 2. I opened the conversation by remarking that to judge from the exiguous information which had reached Jedda for some two or three weeks past, there would appear to have been a lull in hostilities on the southern frontiers of Asir, but more recently I had received reports which went to show that there was now a renewal of activity, particularly in Najran. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman at first was inclined to repeat what has recently become rather a stock phrase of his, that the situation remained unchanged and that no further reply had been received from the Imam Yahya to Ibn Saud's last telegrams. He, however, soon became more communicative and admitted that heavy fighting had recently taken place between the Beni Yam and Imamic forces in Najran, whither the Imam's eldest son, Saif-ul-Islam Ahmad, had returned to take command. He confirmed that Badr, a township which for so long has been on the point of falling into the hands of the Imam, had at last fallen, but he implied that this had occurred not so much as a result of fighting but through the local sub-tribe of the Beni Yam, always an independent element in the tribe, throwing its lot in with the forces of the Imam. The place had been ' occupied.' 3. I next enquired whether Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman himself considered that this renewal of local hostilities signified that Yemeni preparations for more general operations were being pushed forward. He replied that the Imam was, in reality, short of men as he was unable to count on the tribesmen ' press- ganged ' from the districts his forces had occupied, and that Zeidi troops were few in number. He added that there was now scarcely a Saudi soldier left in Nejd, they were all either in Asir or on their way there, and that within one week he anticipated that Saudi military preparations would be complete. His own personal view was that the Imam Yahya would remain unyielding to the demands that Ibn Sand would soon be pressing upon him and that war was inevitable. ' Before ten days were up we should see what we should see,' and the first thrust of the Saudi army against the Yemen would be through Najran. 4. He professed to be glad to be able to pass on the information to me, the Saudi Arab Government entertaining such exceptionally friendly sentiments for the British Government and so forth. He informed me that other foreign representatives in Jedda had recently requested information on the situation with the Yemen and had been refused. This I todk to be a reference to the Italians here, as Signor Tonci some weeks ago informed me he had made a verbal request of this nature. 5. The low estimate entertained by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman of the resources of the Imam Yahya is not borne out by what appears to be the opinion of certain of my foreign colleagues here. From conversations with the Turkish [963 g—2] EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. R fi779/7/ifi/2/51 BUSrvHF h .H fikji 'vV Al No. 1.Charge d'Affaires and the Egyptian consul, I gather they consider that Ibn Saud has a formidable task in front of him if he is to maintain his position in Asir. They state that the Imam, although himself less intelligent than his rival, has not only greater financial resources, but has better trained and equipped soldiers who are at home in the mountainous country of Asir, where Ibn Saud's bedouin are at a disadvantage. I do not consider either of my colleagues is particularly well-informed, but their views are perhaps worth a mention. 6. On the 20th October the Umm-al-Qura appeared containing an official communique, a copy of which I enclose herewith,^) issued by the Press Depart ment, Mecca, a brief summary of which was telegraphed to you on the 21st October. It was accompanied by a very lengthy leading article, of which I enclose a resume, which is in the form of a reply to a letter addressed by the Imam Yahya to Tahsin-al-Faqir and published in the newspaper Falestin of the 29th September last. I have been able to obtain a copy of the article containing the Imam's letter and enclose a translation herewith.^) These articles reveal little of fresh interest; they cover much old ground, protest each in turn the desire of their respective parties for peace and friendship, but bring the prospect of an amicable settlement not a whit nearer. There would indeed appear now but slender hopes for a peaceful solution, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's prophecy that a clash will occur within a few days seems to destroy the half-formed expectation that the situation might be allowed to remain for the present as one of stalemate. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's Ambassador, Rome; His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan, Jerusalem; the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt, Cairo; the Acting Chief Commissioner, Aden; and to the senior naval officer, Red Sea Sloops.

' WITH reference to my telegram No. 321 of to-day's date regarding the situation in Asir, I have the honour to inform you that I made the communication to the Italian Government based on your telegram No. 352 in the form of a note verbale, with the exception of the second half of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference, the gist of which was conveyed to the head of the African Department verbally. 2. Signor Guarnaschelli said at once that if this last information was a reference to recent importations of ^Italian arms into the Yemen, he would not deny that shipments had taken place. The Imam had entered into negotiations for the purchase of arms with an Italian firm, and in view of the fact that Ibn Saud was arming heavily, the Italian Government had not thought that they could stand in his way. But they were not a party to the transaction. Their position was exactly the same as that of the British Government vis-a-vis the British firms from whom Ibn Saud had bought arms and the firm of Besse and Co. who had conveyed them to Asir. 3. The member of my staff who interviewed Signor Guarnaschelli said that as a matter of fact no rumours had reached him of recent acquisitions of Italian arms by the Imam, nor did he know whether Ibn Saud had purchased any British arms. He thanked Signor Guarnaschelli, however, for the information he had volunteered. 4. From subsequent conversation it was evident that the Italian Government were inclined to be comforted by the latest communication of His Majesty's Government, and to read into it some prospect that Ibn Saud had abandoned, at any rate for the moment, his intention of sending in an ultimatum. The member of my staff accordingly, in view of recent despatches and telegrams from Jedda, thought it best to sound a note of caution, and to suggest that the danger of the despatch of an ultimatum was by no means averted. It depended to a considerable extent on the behaviour of the Imam, who, Signor Guarnaschelli would observe, had just attacked Badr. Signor Guarnaschelli replied that he would, of course, get in touch with the Imam (owing to the changing of the Italian doctor at Sanaa this would take about four days) and again impress on him the desirability of resuming negotiations. The essential object was to get these started again. Once they were started, it was perhaps legitimate to hope that some definite agreement by consent might be reached. I have, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to inform you, in somewhat greater detail than I was able to give in my telegram No. 182 of the 27th October, of my interview with the Minister of Finance on that day, relative to the successful request of M. Roger Maigret, French Charge d'Affaires, to be allowed to visit Ibn Saud at 2. M. Maigret, as was recorded at paragraph 183 of Jedda Report for August, left on the 9th August for Syria, where, it is understood, he passed the whole of his leave of absence. According to a statement of a member of the French Legation here to Mr. Furlonge, he was expected to return by a French naval despatch-boat, which was calling at Beirut on its way to the Red Sea. His return was due almost any day, when I received Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's request for an interview on the 27th October. As I have reported, his Excellency informed me that he had been instructed by the King at Riyadh, through Amir Feisal at Mecca, to bring to my notice that M. Maigret had approached Fuad Bey Hamza, whilst the latter was in Syria, with a view to obtain the King's permission to pay a private visit to Nejd upon his return to this country. Upon his return from abroad, Fuad Bey Hamza had placed this request before His Majesty, who had been pleased to accede to it. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman went on to say that M. Maigret was expected the following day and would leave for Nejd at once, and again referred to the private and personal nature of the visit, and alluded to M. Maigret's wish to see the country. He added that, should anything transpire during this visit not of a strictly private character, I should learn of it in due course from Fuad Bey Hamza himself. In reply to a question, he said that the French Charge d'Affaires' interview with the King would take place at Riyadh or perhaps somewhere in the vicinity. 3. The following morning, the 28th, the French naval despatch-boat Yfres duly arrived, but no M. Maigret was observed to come ashore. From information subsequently received it would appear he was not on board, and I now learn that he is expected on or about the 5th November. 4. It is unprecedented for a foreign representative in Jedda to be allowed not merely to pay a visit to Nejd, but to be accorded an interview by Ibn Saud in his desert fastnesses at Riyadh. Whether it is fanciful to read, or attempt to read, into this rather startling piece of information more than its superficial meaning I am at present unable to decide. M. Maigret, in September 1932, paid a visit to Taif—an achievement in its way, though of no special significance—and also, I believe it is true to say, that he takes an intelligent, if not scholarly, interest in matters pertaining to the Arab world. This, however, seems scarcely adequate as a reason, and the alacrity, almost, with which his desire in this instance has been granted does little to dispel one's doubts as to the reasons for this so-called private visit. The cloak of privacy is often the most useful wear in the more delicate dealings with Eastern minds, and the news when it becomes generally known will be, I believe, thus construed. 5. In my telegram under reference I have drawn attention to the fact that this meeting at Riyadh will, if it occurs, form a precedent which other foreign representatives, not least the Soviet Minister, may welcome. It will be interesting to observe whether, indeed, they make any attempt to follow where M. Maigret is so unexpectedly leading the way. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's consul-general at Beirut and to His Majesty's consul at Damascus for information. \ Riyadh. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT.

Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 5.) (No. 333.) Sir, . Jedda, November 14, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 328 and my telegrams Nos. 190 and 193 of the 7th, 12th and 12th November, respectively, regarding the present dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya of the Yemen, I have the honour to report more fully than was possible in my telegrams under reference my conversation of the 12th November with Fuad Bey Hamza in so far as it concerned the present situation of tension between the two countries. The meeting was the first I had been able to have with the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs since his return from abroad, owing to his somewhat prolonged absence in Riyadh, as I have reported to you elsewhere. 2. Fuad Bey Hamza explained that he had gone to Riyadh immediately upon his return to this country in order to consult Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi- Yemen situation, to bring his own information on the subject up to date and to acquaint himself with what he termed the ' inside ' of the question. He was cognisant of the communications which had already passed between Ibn Saud and His Majesty's Government through Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and this Legation, and said that it was the King himself who was dealing with all matters relating to the present situation, as all papers were at once passed on to Riyadh by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, copies only being retained by the Ministry at Mecca. It was a case, therefore, of the two rulers, rather than their Governments, being in direct control of this delicate situation. 3. He informed me that since my last interview with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman there had been certain further developments of importance. On the 8th November Ibn Saud had received (probably by wireless) a communication from the Imam Yahya asking to be informed of the reason for the recent concentration of Saudi troops near the southern frontiers of Asir. Two days later the King had replied stating that the measures were purely precautionary and were a consequence of similar concentrations and other military activities which had for some time been steadily pressed forward on the Yemeni side of the border. The King had again emphasised, according to Fuad Bey Hamza, his firm intention of avoiding any act of aggression, but maintained his resolve to defend the integrity of his territories. The King had also seized the opportunity presented by this renewal of correspondence with the Imam to include with his reply a reformula tion of his demands, his four points (summarised in my telegram No. 186), and Fuad Bey Hamza went on to describe the communication as being in the nature of an ultimatum. He represented the King's demands as reasonable, for, said he, as far as the Tihama was concerned, Ibn Saud would be justified, from a legal point of view, in demanding the cession of more territory to the south than he was actually claiming. When Ibn Saud concluded his first treaty with the Idrisi some fourteen years ago, the latter's seat of government was at Hodeida, and territory as far south as that port was then considered as the Idrisi sphere. Ibn Saud, however, was now contenting himself with that portion of Tihamat Asir as far only as the present frontier. Surely this was reasonable. 4. As regarded the Idrisi himself, by the terms of the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of ' Bon-Voisinage,' &amp;c., of December 1931, he should have been handed over to Ibn Saud by the Imam. The treaty provided for the extradition of all offenders, political as well as other, yet the Imam's obligation in this respect had not been carried out. But Ibn Saud was magnanimously prepared not to insist on the surrender of the Idrisi (in deference to the traditional Arab custom in regard to asylum and sanctuary), provided that he was either expelled from the Yemen or, Fuad Bey Hamza gave me to understand, removed from the frontier zone to some place as, for example, Sana, where he would be out of harm's way. Surely this, too, was reasonable. [991 e—1]2 5. When the Deputy Minister stated that this ultimatum, or quasi- ultimatum, had not been published, and that on the nature of the Imam s ieply would depend the King's future course of action, I intervened, as described in my telegram No. 190, to inform him of my instructions in the event of the issue of an ultimatum. He thereupon endeavoured to define the nature of Ibn Sand's communication to the Imam as a restatement of the Saudi case and an invitation to the Imam to give his views thereon. Although earlier in the conversation Fuad Bey Hamza had stated that the King was well aware of Zeidi ambitions, both through the Imam's statements to the last Saudi delegation to visit Sana and from inspired articles in the Arabic press of neighbouring countries, as well latterly as from the Yemen's sole newspaper the Iman, I accepted his explanation and agreed to take no further action for the moment beyond acquainting you with these new developments. I might here say that I have since received information from a source which in the past has proved most reliable, a source, moreover, in touch with official circles, to the effect that Ibn Sand's latest communication was his '' last and decisive '' message, and I may therefore have to address you again by telegraph in the course of the next few days in regard to the real nature of this ultimatum. 6. An ultimatum had been prepared, Fuad Bey Hamza continued, and would be issued, if necessity arose, together with a Green Book which would contain a complete statement of the Saudi case and which was now in the hands of the printers, in the course of ten or fourteen days. 7. He went on to speak of the situation should it unfortunately deteriorate into hostilities. Of the sympathy of His Majesty's Government they had no doubt, but the Saudi Government would like to feel as assured of the attitude of the Italian Government. The latter were in treaty relations with Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Government were sincerely desirous that those relations should remain friendly, but they (the Italian Government) were also in treaty relations with the Imam, and should a conflict ensue, might be inclined to lend support to the Imam as the older friend. I pointed out that this doubt had been raised by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman several months ago, and expressed my conviction that the Italian Government's attitude in the event of hostilities would be strictly correct. As far as the supply of arms by them to the Imam was concerned, I said, making use of an argument already used at the Foreign Office with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, that the Italians were entitled to trade in munitions and, moreover, had been doing so for a considerable time before this crisis arose—a point Fuad Bey Hamza seemed to admit. As he pressed me to request His Majesty's Government to favour his Government with their views, I promised to inform you that he had expressed these misgivings. He then asked me point-blank, as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman had done (and reported in my telegram No. 184), who, in regard to the recent representations, had taken the initiative, His Majesty's Government or the Italian Government ? I answered, as on the previous occasion, that, as far as I was aware, the demarche was the outcome of joint consultations. 8. The Deputy Minister went on to speak, feelingly, that counsels of modera tion should be offered to the other side rather than to Ibn Sand, whose patience and longanimity in dealing with so obstinate, perverse and fractious an individual as the Imam Yahya had won general recognition. He said that he had gathered from his recent visit to Riyadh that Ibn Sand was determined to avoid hostilities at all costs. lor one thing, were the King to ignore the numerous appeals he had received from Moslems in neighbouring countries, calling upon him to avoid a fratricidal Arab war, and to take the first step in a war with the Yemen, he would at once forfeit the sympathy of the whole Islamic world. For another! the cost of a wai would prove disastrous and the financial situation of this country was bad enough as it was. But, Fuad Bey tlamza added, any attack on the honour of the country would be resisted by all the means in their power. He quoted the Arab proverb to the effect that if the only road that presents itself be a thorny one, then one is obliged to go that way. i 9 ' • ^ co ] lcl 1 ude( i ^ describing certain frontier intrigues which, he said, had been suitably dealt with and denied, on my putting a question to him, that Saudi troops had crossed the frontier into the Yemen in the neighbourhood of Medi (as reported m my telegram No. 193). With regard to this denial, however, I am not altogether satisfied, for strong rumours are current, and are reported by the source Aw 16 c ? ea J r . lier m thls despatch, that such an infraction of the frontier at that point by Saudi troops has actually occurred, and it is also said that seriousfighting is now in progress in the Tihama, whither a further 400-500 troops were sent from here (by sea to Jizan) yesterday. While I am not at the moment prepared to accept the latter report, the next day or two may witness the commencement of hostilities and a war may well be in full swing before the formal ultimatum, which Fuad Bey Hamza states is still up the Saudi sleeve, can be launched in accordance with the punctilio of more enlightened practice. 10.

The latter had been complete ly surprised and had lost 700 men killed. The occurrence/ I 1;- 2 - The occurrence took place during a truce when full peace negotiations were proceeding and after Bin Saud had issued most stringent orders to all his generals that no aggressive move whatever was to be undertaken. As a result of the incident the Imam Yahya at once broke off all peace conversations, and ordered his armies to hold themselves in readiness for an immediate offensive. Bin Saud had at once dismissed Saayid bin ITaisal and had telegraphically disowned the attack and expressed regrets, but the Imam Yahya had refused to accept his explanation s* A couple of days before the messenger left Riath, Bin Saud believing war to be aainent, had sent his son the 3mir Saud post haste to Sbha to take supreme com mand of the Sa f udi armies in Asir, With him had gone all available troops in Riath (800 men) in 80 light lorries under the following members of the Royal Family: Khalid bin Mohamed as Saud Fahad bin Sa'ad al Saud. 6» His Excellency the Shaikh when telling me the above story stated that hitherto he bad not believed there wDuld be any war, but in view of his man T s story he feared only a miracle could avert hostilities now a What made him more pessimistic was the fact that he had received by the Air Mail of 19th January, a letter dated the 10th frcrn a Kuwait subject in Aden to the effect that Yahya appeared entirely bent on war and had concentrated all available troops on the Asir front and was sending large quantities of arms and ammunition to the tribes of Asir. 7• While I think it somewhat early to accept the story of the Shaikh's messenger, I nevertheless fear there may be considerable truth in his report.

He was met on the landing-ground close to the town, which for the previous two days had been the scene of considerable activity, by the Amir of Jedda, a posse of local notables and a large concourse of the inhabitants. He had left Egypt on the 2nd December and had spent the night at Tor, where he had taken the opportunity of inspecting the quarantine station. He had resumed his journey on the 3rd, had descended at Wejh, where a stay of some little time was made, and at Yanbu, where a short stay was necessary for the purpose of refuelling. His pilot was Mr. G. J. Mahony, of Misr-Airwork, S.A.E. 2. It is still early to learn more than I was able to report in my despatch under reference as to the objects of his visit and the measure of success he is likely to achieve. I understand from my Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha is pleased with his reception by the Saudi authorities. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, has been in Jedda during the past two days, and I learn that conversations have been proceeding at the Kandara Palace^ where the members of the mission are being entertained as the guests of the Saudi Government. 3. Talaat Pasha, whom I met for a short time to-day, informed me that he proposed to leave for Mecca by car to-morrow and expected to return in two or three days' time. He would take to the air again on the 9th December for Yanbu, whence he intended to go to Medina by car, returning to resume his journey to Egypt from Yanbu two days later. 4. His visit has naturally received a good deal of local attention, and has. it is believed, excited considerable interest in Government circles. One is inclined to wonder how far Fuad Bey Hamza, during his leave, which was partly spent in Egypt, was instrumental in preparing the ground for this visit. At any rate, the obvious intention of Talaat Pasha is to create an impression as favourable to the objects he has in view as he r - ibly can. The D.H. Dragon aeroplane has been partly occupied since its ^ .i^al in carrying out short demonstration flights for the benefit of both European and native passengers. I am also informed by mv Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pasha, to mark the occasion, brought with him a large selection of goods, probably of Egyptian manufacture, for distribution as charity to the poor of this country. It is pleasant to observe this pious practice, one of the five obligations of the true Moslem, going so happily hand in hand with, and sanctifying, ct more material commercial purpose. I hope to be in a position to report further on this matter in due course. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade, and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Egypt. I have, &amp; q . A. S.

Drummond to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 2, 1934.) (No. 1022.) Sir, Rome, December 30, 1933. WITH reference to my telegram No. 389 of to-day's date, I have the honour to transmit herewith translations of three notes verhales^) from the Italian Government on the subject of the situation in South-West Arabia, together with a translation of a personal letter from Signor Suvich to myself which accompanied these notes. 2. It is evident from the tone of this last communication that the Italian Government attach real importance to the projected discussions in Rome; and for that reason, if for no other, I hope that it will be possible for a member of your Department to come out here as soon as is convenient. From the first two notes you will observe that the Italian Government are anxious to justify their own attitude in regard to Asir ; and no doubt they still have hopes of influencing in some degree that of His Majesty's Government. In effect, however, they have agreed to conversations in full realisation of the latter's attitude; and they cannot complain if His Majesty's Government eventually fail to modify it. Their arguments, however, are moderately set forth, and will no doubt receive the examination which they merit. 3. I regret that the Italian Government should have thought it necessary to send the third note verhale at all; but it should be remembered that they have throughout maintained that (in their view) it is impossible for British policy to be conducted in watertight compartments. 4. I should perhaps add that the substance of Jedda telegram No. 223 of the 26th December and the gist of No. 226 of the 29th December were conveyed to the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. As regards the latter telegram, it was merely stated that, according to the Saudi Government, agreement seemed to be in sight on all the major points (including Asir), with the exception of Nejran. Signor Guarnaschelli, to whom this information was given, expressed pleasure and relief at the progress made, which, he seemed to infer, implied that Ibn Saud had, in fact, consented to ' negotiate ' in regard to Asir. He added that he would try to obtain confirmation of the progress made from Sanaa. I have, &amp;c. ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. M. Suvich to Sir E. Drummond. (Translation.) My dear Ambassador, DURING the last few weeks we have had occasion to consider the situation in Arabia; the Ministry has been in contact on this subject with the Embassy, and your Excellency has forwarded certain notes regarding the various aspects of the situation itself. I send you herewith the replies to these notes, which I have preferred to submit together, given the connexion between them, and after having given my own particular attention to the question, both in its present phase and in its preceding phases. Besides the events which are now taking place in Arabia, the fundamental fact which underlies these notes is formed, as you know, by the conclusions of [6 b—2] Not printed. bthe Rome conversations of 1927. and represents one of the aspects of Anglo- Italian collaboration after the war, and one which is both interesting and fruitful, seeing that it has certainly contributed to the maintenance of peace between the States of the Arabian Peninsula. It is hardly necessary that I should draw your attention to the contents of the attached notes, and that I should request you to be so good as to draw the attention of your Government to them. I am also happy to inform you that I do so at the instance of his Excellency the head of the Government, with the request that you should be so good as to interest the Prime Minister, Mr. MacDonald, in the question. At this moment, in which our two Governments are bound in the interests of peace to continue their common work for the best solution of the problems and questions which concern Europe, and one may say the whole world, the Italian Government desires to express the hope that such collaboration and understanding may also continue in regard to the problems of the Arabian Peninsula, a result which could not fail to have the most favourable influence on the pacification of this district, and, in general, a favourable repercussion on the whole work of Anglo-Italian collaboration. Accept, &amp;c. SUVICH. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Note Verbale from Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (Translation.) THE Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the notes verbales of the British Embassy Nos. 350 and 365 of the 20th and 26th October last, and of No. 372 of the 7th November, as well as the receipt of the aide-memoire of the 30th October and the 17th November last, and with reference to their contents and (with reference) at the same time to the Ministry's preceding notes verhales on the question and. in particular, to No. 228396/118 of the 21st September last, have the honour to make the following communication ;— 2. According to the British Embassy's note verhale No. 350 of the 20th October last, the British Government considers that its own position in regard to the sovereignty over Asir is determined by the fact that in 1931 it entered into relations with the Hejaz Government regarding communications between certain localities under British administration and the port of Jizan. In this regard note No. 350 of the British Embassy refers to a preceding note verhale No. 296 of the 24th July, 1931. The same British note No. 350 adds that such action on the part of the British Government constituted an informal admission of the rights of Ibn Sand over this province, though, in order to meet the point of view of the Italian Government, the British Government deferred any direct and foimal manifestation of its lecogmtion of the sovereignty ot the Saudi King over Asir. It further asserts that the British Government holds, so far as^ it is concerned, that this sovereignty is valid de facto and de jure. Since reference was made to the preceding exchange of notes in 1931 the Italian Government considers it opportune to resume as follows the contents of these notes :— In its aide-memoire 9f the 30th May, 1931, the British Embassy mlonned the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the London Government had received a note trom the Hejaz Government m which the latter requested British acquiescence in what, according to the point of view of the latter should be considered as the de facto and de jure status of Asir, and that in these circum stances the British Government had the intention of recognising the absorntion of Asir on the part of the Hejaz, but that, before doing so, it desired to receive the observations of the Italian Government t0 rece ' ve of I f0 :: F , OT .fS'. fPly was a detailed of the 25th June, 1931, m which it referred to the discussion of the Asir question which took place during the Rome conversations of 1927, and concluded byw 1 3 expressing the hope that the British Government would find it convenient not to proceed with the demanded recognition in the interests of the maintenance of peace in the Arabian peninsula. The British Embassy made it clear in its note verhale of the 24th July, 1931, that the communication of the Hejaz Government did not demand a formal expression of recognition of the incorporation of Asir in the dominions of Ibn Saud, but only the conclusion of agreements for laying down the methods of communication in certain localities under British administration and the ports of Jizan and Asir. It added that the British Government, in order to meet the views of the Italian Government, agreed to put off all formal and direct expression of recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, although it remained of opinion that Asir had become de facto and de jure an integral part of the Saudi provinces. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in its note verhale of the 13th August, 1931, took note that no demand for formal recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir had been put forward by the Hejaz Govern ment to the London Government, and noted with pleasure that the British and Italian Governments were agreed in the determination to put off all formal and direct expression of recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir. The statement made in the British note No. 350 of the 20th October, that the London Government considers that the question of the sovereignty over Asir is determined by the fact that in 1931 they entered into correspondence with the Hejaz Government with regard to the method of communication between certain localities under British administration and the port of Jizan, and that such a fact constitutes an informal admission on the British side of the rights of Ibn Saud over Asir, represents a new statement which seems to go beyond the idea expressed in the British note of the 24th July, 1931. The establishment of such communications is a simple fact which, in the opinion of the Italian Government, does not in itself imply any admission, even informal, of the rights \of Ibn Saud over Asir; still less would it seem to have as a consequence the determination of the position of the British Government in regard to the question of the sovereignty over Asir. The Italian Government points out in this connexion that, as was mentioned in note verhale of the 25th June, 1931, the representatives of the British Govern ment during the conversations at Rome declared that all territorial questions in regard to Asir, and in general in regard to the frontiers between the Hejaz and the Yemen, were regarded as an internal Arabian question which did not interest the British Government. So far as it is concerned, the Royal Government considers the question of Asir as still open between the Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen; and, basing itself on the spirit of the conclusions of the Rome conversations, holds that it should not in any case commit itself in regard to a dispute between the two Arab States. Recalling in particular that the original cause of this dispute is the suppression carried out by Ibn Saud of the buffer State, the existence of which was considered necessary in the Rome conversations in order to avoid acute friction between the two Arab States, the Royal Government trusts that the British Government will uphold its own determination to avoid any formal and direct recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, and will also abstain generally from committing itself in regard to the dispute which separates the two States. 3. Having thus explained the point of view of the Italian Government in regard to Asir, it is now necessary to consider the action which has been or will be taken by the British and Italian Governments with a view to preventing an armed conflict between the two Arab States. The Royal Government, for its part, has not failed to exercise all possible influence on the Imam with a view to avoid the outbreak of hostilities; it considers, so far as it is concerned, that it has attained its end, seeing that in spite of the continuous violations, from 1926 to the present time, on the part of Ibn Saud of the de facto and de jure status in Asir—a province over which the Imam claims and maintains his well-known rights—it has succeeded in avoiding, on the part of the Imam himself, a reaction greater than that which has taken place, and which has been limited to verbal protests and to categorical reaffirmations of the above-mentioned rights. With regard to the analogous action to be exercised in regard to Ibn Saud, the Italian Government, with reference to what was said in the first part of [6 b—2] b 24 paragraph 5 of note No. 350 of the British Embassy, is perfectly aware of the difference existing in the situation in which the British Government found itself in regard to the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah. However, if the British Government is not in a position to exercise its influence on both parties, the possibility exists that such influence might be exercised in a parallel manner on Ibn Saud and on the Imam. In effect and in the same way as the pressure exercised on the Imam by the Italian Government, the British Government has renewed its pressure on Ibn Saud, as is shown by note verh'de No. 265 of the 26th October last, and by the aide-memoire of the 30th October, and by the note verhale No. 372 of 7th November. 4. The Royal Government holds that parallel English and Italian action on the Imam and on Ibn Saud should continue to be exercised with a view to avoiding the further deterioration of the grave political situation existing to-day in the Arabian Peninsula, and the interruption of the direct relations which still exist between Ibn Saud and the Imam resulting in armed conflict between the two States. 5. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs notes with interest what the British Embassy communicated in their note verhale No. 372 of the 7th November last regarding the attitude of Ibn Saud and his point of view in regard to the existing disputes with the Imam. From this communication it results that the principal objects of Ibn Saud are to assure— {a) The recall of the forces of the Imam from the de facto frontier existing before the outbreak of the present conflict (Ibn Saud evidently refers to the occupation on the part of the Imam of the territory of Nejran). (b) An agreed delimitation of this frontier. {c) The confirmation of preceding agreements. While not wishing to discuss the merits of the Saudi point of view, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs cannot refrain from observing that, while it does not appear that the occupation of the territory of Nejran by the Imam violated any existing rights of the Saudi Kingdom, no statement was made by Ibn Saud regarding the territory of Asir, which he evidently considers as an integral part of his kingdom, but which, in fact, constitutes the principal subject of dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imam. It is, indeed, a positive fact, in regard to which, in spite of the uncertainty of the available evidence ((' I'incertezza degli elementi disponibili ') that it was Ibn Saud who changed the de facto and de jure situation existing in Asir by annexing it definitely to the Saudi Kingdom. 6. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs is replying separately to the note verhale of the British Embassy No. 384 of the 20th' November last. Rome, December 1933 (XII). Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Note verbale from the Italian Ministry for Foreign A ffairs. (Translation.) THE Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of note verh'de No. 384 of the 20th November last, in which the British Embassy informed them that the London Government, appreciating the desire of the Italian Government to eliminate all possible points of friction between the two Governments and to co-operate m assuring the re-establishment of pacific i elations m ^outh-V^est Arabia, accepts the proposal of the Italian Government to hold a meeting of experts in Rome, but adds at the same time that it desires to know in advance more precisely the proposals and, if possible, the programme which the Italian Government has in mind. It adds that the London Government is, for its part, forced to state that it is not in a positionto modify its attitude in regard to the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir proper, that is to say, over that territory at least over which the Idrisi exercised his own sovereignty at the time of the Treaty of Mecca in 1926, and that it would be ready to elaborate the juridical reasons on which its attitude was based. It further asserts that there is no question of proposals intended to modify the conclusions of the conversations of Rome in 1927, which still, according to the point of view of the British Government, form the basis of the Anglo-Italian relations in Arabian and Red Sea questions. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, while thanking the British Embassy for its courteous communication, has the honour to inform it that the Italian Government is grateful to the British Government for having promptly accepted the Italian proposals for a meeting of experts in Rome. With regard to the request for explanations made by the British Embassy as to the proposals and the programme which the Royal Government have in mind to lay before the projected meeting, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to state that, as the Director-General of Political Affairs had already had occasion to communicate to the counsellor of the British Embassy on the 2nd November last, the meetings between the Italian and British experts should have for object the joint examination, on the basis of the conclusions of the conversations of Rome in 1927—which, in the opinion of the Royal Govern ment, also constitute the basis of the Anglo-Italian relations in Arabian and Red Sea matters—and in the interests of the maintenance of peace in the Arabian peninsula and of friendly co-operation between the two Governments, of the events which have since taken place and the situation which has developed in those regions. 3. It is precisely because the Italian Government completely agrees with the British Government in holding that the conclusions of the conversations in Rome should constitute the basis of Anglo-Italian relations in all Arabian and Red Sea questions, and hence should be the starting-point of the projected meeting of experts, that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs cannot avoid being rather preoccupied in regard to the statement contained in the note verhale under reply, according to which the British Government could not abandon the attitude assumed by them in regard to the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir. 4. It should, in fact, be remembered that, as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has already had occasion to explain in detail to the British Embassy in fts preceding notes verhales (see, for example, note verhale No. 222751/91 of the 25th June, 1931), the Treaty of Mecca of 1926, by which Ibn Saud set up his own protectorate over Asir, was the subject of discussion during the conversations at Rome in 1927; and in regard to it the British delegates, after having demanded and received instructions from the London Government, declared that the British Government could not have refused a Hejazi demand for the recognition of the Treaty of 1926, seeing that it was about to conclude with the Hejaz a Treaty of Friendship, and a refusal would have compromised the conclusion of this treaty (the treaty was afterwards concluded in 1927, although the British Government continued in its non-recognition of the situation created by Ibn Saud in Asir), but that, in any case, the British representatives, in the name of their Government, declared that all territorial questions, such as those of Asir, were regarded as an internal Arabian question and did not interest the London Government. It is further noted that the record of the Rome conversations expressly consider Asir as the State existing in the Arabian Peninsula in regard to which the possibility was foreseen of taking the action contemplated in paragraph 2 of the conclusions themselves. 5. The statement mentioned in the note of the British Embassy No. 384 of the 20th November last, according to which the London Government desire to make it clear even before the opening of the proposed conversations between experts, that they are not in a position to depart from the attitude adopted by them regarding the sovereignty of Ibn Saud over Asir, deserves to be explained in relation to the assurances given in the course of the Rome conversations regarding British disinterestedness in territorial questions regarded as internal Arabian questions, if only to give rise in the proposed meeting of experts to a useful examination of the new situation created by Ibn Saud in Asir, which constitutes the principal modification of the political situation existing in the Arabian Peninsula at the time of the Rome conversations of 1927, and forms at present the principal reason for the existing tension between the Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen.6 6. The Eoyal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, while draiving the attention of the British Embassy to the above considerations, has the honour to confirm that it is ready for its part to begin the proposed conversations on the basis of the conclusions come to in 1927 in order to examine the events which have taken place since then, and the situation which has developed in Arabia (thus including the question of the action taken by Ibn Saud in regard to Asir) in the interests of peace in that region and of the friendly co-operation between the British and Italian Governments.

I was glad to receive the latter but Dickson's information squared so little with mine that I thought it would be useful to you to have a summary account of the situation as seen from here. Hence my telegram to you No.9 of January 31. I did not repeat this to the Foreign Office but sent a copy by bag. I have of course reported every stage of the Sa f udi-Yemen business to the people at home but economy forbids my repeating my telegrams to London toother interested posts like Aden to which I merely telegraph periodical summaries of main developments. The copy of my telegram sent to the /Foreign -Col. T.C.W.Fowle, C.B .E., I.A. , Bushire./ Foreign Office will not reach them for quite a long time. The only object was to complete their permanent record of all that has passed here. I have since included the following in a more general telegram of February 3 : ' I have informed Aden and S.N.O. 'by telegraph of essential facts up to date. I also telegraphed main facts to Bushire on January 31 as Political Agent at Kuv/ait had got report from Riyadh that a Yemen contingent had been destroyed by Sa^di forces in Najran or elsewhere with result that Im^m had broken off negotiations and ordered an advance.' I hope that my procedure has not caused you any embarrassment. The situation is so obscure that Tts every scjfap of information is useful and, as I have said, I was glad to get Dickson*s contribution. The amplification in your telegram to the India Office is of /furthersn y\ : 7 / further interest as Badr is definitely in Najran.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 325 of the 31st October and to my telegram No. 216 of the 10th December, relative to the visit of M. Roger Maigret, French Charge d'Affaires, to Ibn Sand at Riyadh, I have the honour to report that, as foreshadowed in my telegram under reference, my French colleague, who arrived back from leave on the 3rd December, left for Riyadh yesterday in a car provided by the Government in company with Haji Hamdi, the French-Algerian vice-consul and Fuad Bey Hamza. In my interview with the latter on the 10th December, he admitted that M. Maigret's visit would not be of a purely personal and private nature as I was informed on the 27th October by Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman. Conversations would take place on matters of no great importance, except to the countries concerned, viz., Syria and Saudi Arabia, and would relate to trade and commercial questions affecting the two countries. Fuad Bey remarked that he expected to be absent in Nejd for about two weeks, but that on his return he hoped to be in a position to give Sir Andrew Ryan more information in regard to the objects of this visit. He also observed that M. Maigret was ' opening the door ' of Nejd to other visitors. 2. I understand that M. Maigret's projected visit was known in Syria at the latest early in November, as the Indian vice-consul of this Legation, passing- through Damascus about that time on his return from leave in Istanbul, found rumour very busy with the news. It was stated in some quarters that France was ready to lend countenance to Ibn Saud in his present political difficulties, and the wildest conjectures were current .according to which Italy and France were the 'backers ' of the Imam and Ibn Saud respectively in the present dispute, Great Britain, for once, being omitted from the picture. 3. It would be of great interest to learn in due course from His Majesty's consular officers at Beirut and Damascus, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch, whether any light, independent of the perhaps somewhat refracted information promised by Fuad Bey Hamza, can be thrown from Syria upon the ^ inward reasons for this visit. Can there be among these matters of mutual commercial interest to the two countries the rather baffling problem of the market for thrones in Syria? I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 285 of the 9th September regarding the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that the day of cheap and plentiful water for Jedda now seems as far off as ever. 2. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziria Committee are still at work at Waziria extending the old Turkish conduit farther back into the foothills in order to increase the head of water, which seeps into it from the subsoil, and a satisfactory flow of water into the town continues. They have, however, done nothing towards the renewal of the conduit near the town; and it has now been established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated filth of ages that the water, which is reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of germ. Europeans here consequently eschew it, and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considerations of price a great deal more than by those of hwiene, fights shy. 3. It is estimated that an expenditure of £5,000 would suffice to repair the whole conduit, renewing the piping where necessary, and thus relieve Jedda of any future anxiety as regards water. The water runs from these wells to the town by gravity, and no pumping apparatus, not even the now derelict windmill pump introduced by Mr. Twitchell, is needed. An enterprising municipality would whole-heartedly support the scheme. But the Waziria Committee is lethargic. The all-powerful Minister of Finance is believed to be hostile to the scheme because its fruition would necessitate the closing down of the condensers which at present supply the town and would thus deprive him of one small but certain source of revenue. The local merchants on the committee are far too much in awe of him to act effectively. Whilst, therefore, the yield of certain municipal taxes has been voted for furthering the scheme and there is some talk of a future levy on pilgrims, no efforts are being made to raise an adequate sura for the purpose, and the labours of the well-meaning Dehlavi seem doomed to be stifled through lack of funds. 4.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 352 of the 5th instant, relative to the visit of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission, under the leadership of Talaat Pasha Narb, to this country, I have the honour to report that the members of the mission left by air for Yenbu on the morning of the 10th December, intending to journey by car thence to Medina and, returning the second day, to resume their flight to Egypt. 2. The programme followed whilst they were in this country conformed closely to that reported in my despatch under reference. Talaat Pasha Narb left Jedda by car on the 6th December for Mecca, where he was entertained by Amir Eeisal, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muhammad-el- Fadhl, and returned on the 8th, when he dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. 3. The results of the visit, in so far as they are known, or partially known, may be stated under the following heads :— (a) Banque Misr. —I am informed by the manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), that his firm have been given, for the time being, the agency of the Banque Misr as regards its purely banking business. Mr. Warner expressed the opinion, however, that it would not be long before the Banque Misr established a branch of their own in this country. (b) Local Representation for Pilgrim Ships. —It is understood that this has been given to the local firm of Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Ridha. It was stated on the 8th December that, although no written agreement had at the time been signed, yet Talaat Pasha Narb had definitely promised the representation of this shipping interest to the local firm. Mr. Warner, in this connexion, stated that his firm had been given the handling of the money of Egyptian pilgrims, probably qua agents of the Banque Misr. .(c) Pilgrimage hy Air from Egypt—It is believed that this question has received some consideration during the stay of the mission, though I am unaware of the result, if any. I have received 'the impression that the Saudi Arab Government have not proved very receptive to this idea. (d) Sale of Egyptian Products am not at present in possession of information on the activities of the mission in regard to the organisation of the sale of Egyptian products. The gratis distribution of such goods, to which I referred in my last despatch, was, I find, not confined to the poor alone, but was liberally used as commercial ground-bait in business circles as well. 4.

Sir, Jedda, December 12, 1933. SINCE my despatch No. 339 of the 27th November last, in which I had the honour to bring certain further information regarding the present state of tension between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen to your notice, the chief interest in the situation has centred in developments in the long-range negotiations, if such they may be termed, now proceeding between the two rulers. I do not propose to recount these in detail, as I venture to think they have been adequately reported to you by telegram, beyond briefly indicating the stage to which these exchanges have now come. According to Fuad Bey Hamza, there would now appear to be some prospect of a preliminary understanding over two of the Saudi four points, viz., the ' minor ' one (to quote Fuad Bey) of the disposal of the Idrisi; and Najran. 2. With regard to the former, it seems that Ibn Saud is willing to waive his demand for the Idrisi's extradition and, in return, the Imam has agreed to remove him from the danger-zone of the frontier to the interior of the Yemen. It is understood the retreat selected by the Idrisi is Zebid in the Tihama. 3. The position with regard to Najran is not so clear. Ibn Saud, Fuad Bey informed me, had emphasised to the Imam the tendency of the tribes in Najran to look more towards Nejd than to the Yemen of recent years, but, for the sake of a peaceful settlement, declared himself ready so far to ' sacrifice his own interests ' as to agree to the neutralisation of this territory as it was in former years. He was prepared to agree with the Imam that neither should send forces into Najran except for the maintenance of law and order, and then only after consultation and upon mutual agreement. This was the King's ' last word ' on this point. The Imam's reply consisted of a statement to the effect that the presence of his own troops in this province was due solely to his desire to preserve security; and since then, Fuad Bey continued, the Saudi Arab Government had received information that the Imamic forces were withdrawing from Najran, having burned and razed to the ground the township of Badr, the religious centre of the Makrami sect, on evacuating it. Fuad Bey stated that the Yemeni troops were now being concentrated on the Asir frontier at Medi, Haradh, Saada and a fourth place, whose name was unknown to him, between Haradh and Saada. 4. So much for the present diplomatic phase. To judge from the statements of Fuad Bey Hamza, upon which the above account is based, the atmosphere in this dispute would now appear to be less highly charged. Militarily, the situation has undergone no material change. Reinforcements and supplies continue to flow south, but in a somewhat slower stream; and reports of road-making along the stony road to Abha from Mecca, to vary the story of warlike preparations, have also been received. The frontier was quiet, according to Fuad Bey, but there had been cases of individual desertions to the Imam of tribesmen in Asir, chiefly of the Abadil. 5. The general situation, therefore, has every appearance of having taken a turn for the better, but that this view is not shared by others in a position to form a considered opinion was illustrated by the report contained in my telegram No. 219 of the 12th that war with the Yemen was now imminent and that the King was proceeding to Asir to take command in person of the Saudi army there. The report reached me, through a trusted intermediary, from the person mentioned in your despatch No. 263 of the 5th October last; but, although this individual is normally well-informed, having, as you are aware, access to official circles, the story is so much at variance with the latest news gathered from Fuad Bey, that I feel constrained to await further confirmation.

January 15, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. [E 50/2/25] No. 1. John Simon to Sir E. Drummond {Rome). (No. 39.) Sir, Foreign Office, January 15, 1934. I HAVE reconsidered in the light of your Excellency's despatch No. 1022 of the 30th December, and the three notes verhales from the Italian Government, copies of which were enclosed therein, the proposal that His Majesty's Govern ment should send an expert to Rome to discuss the position in South-West Arabia; and I have decided that, in the circumstances and for the reasons described below, it is no longer expedient to accede to this proposal. In spite of the message from Signor Mussolini, conveyed in Signor Suvich's letter to you, I have not felt justified in troubling the Prime Minister in the midst of his many and pressing preoccupations with this complicated question which is only of secondary importance. 2. In the first place, although, when provisionally agreeing in my telegram No. 375 of the 17th November to the Italian Government's proposal, I made it clear that His Majesty's Government were unable to change their previous attitude in regard to King Ibn Saud's sovereignty over Asir proper, two of the three recent notes from the Italian Government deal almost exclusively with that question. They apparently regard it as the crux of the whole matter, and, it must be assumed, as you point out in paragraph 2 of your despatch, that they still hope to influence the attitude of His Majesty's Government thereon in the course of the proposed discussions. It is, however, impossible for His Majesty's Govern ment to modify their view that the area over which the Idrisi held sovereignty at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca, passed, in virtue of that treaty, under the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud, and has formed de jure and de facto part of his dominions, at any rate since his arrangement of 1930 with the Idrisi. 3. Although it is undesirable to become involved in a detailed and complicated controversy with the Italian Government on this subject, it may be useful to you to have a full statement of the grounds which have led His Majesty's Government to this view. The position in international law appears to them to be as follows. Prior to the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca of 1926 (the text of which is to be found in Eastern Affairs, Part XX, January to June 1927, No. 11), the Idrisi was an independent ruler exercising sovereignty over certain territories in South-West Arabia. By the Treaty of Mecca the Idrisi handed over to King Ibn Saud the entire control over his foreign relations, while retaining the government of the internal affairs of his country, apart from financial matters, which were also handed over to Ibn Saud, The result of the Treaty of Mecca was to establish a protectorate by Ibn Saud over the territories of the Idrisi as they existed at that date, and the Idrisi became unable, owing to the fact that he no longer possessed the control of foreign affairs, to alienate to any other Power any of his territories. As a result of the treaty of 1926, the Idrisi ceased to possess the status of an independent person under international law. 4. In 1930, as the result of negotiations which culminated in letters of the 10th October from the Idrisi and from his council to King Ibn Saud (see Eastern Affairs, Part XXVII, July to December 1930, No. 107), and as further defined in an arrangement contained in a report signed on the 16th November by repre sentatives of King Ibn Saud and of the Idrisi (see the same print volume, No. 108), the Idrisi handed over to King Ibn Saud the internal government of his territory; and these arrangements were put into force by an order issued by King Ibn Saud on the 20th November, 1930 (see the same print volume. No. 108), under which the Idrisi territory was governed by a direct representative, appointed by King Ibn Saud under the title of Emir, assisted by an elected legislative council, the Idrisi merely retaining a nominal position of head of the Idrisi territory under Ibn Saud, with some powers of veto over the decisions of the Emir and the legislative council, subject to the final decision of King Ibn Saud. It appears to be perfectly clear that, as the result of the arrangements made in 1930, King [6 p-1]2 Ibn Saud acquired full and complete sovereignty oyer the territories of the Idrisi, and that the form of government set up therein became merely part of the internal constitution of the territories of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Wejd and its Dependencies, as it was then called. . . 5. The territories over which King Ibn feaud thus acquned sovereignty were the same territories as those over which he had acquired a protectoiate under the Treaty of Mecca of 1926, namely, all the territories which were under the sovereignty of the Idrisi, at the moment of the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca. This appeared to His Majesty s Government at the time and s till appears to them—to have been the position at that date. They considered further that Kino- Ibn Sand's sovereignty over these territories was effective m international law and did not require any express or implied recognition by any other power to render it legally complete and effective. 6. It was on these grounds that-His Majesty's Government (when the question was under discussion with the Italian Government in 1931 as a result of a request of the Hejaz-Nejd Government, which involved entering into correspondence with them on matters concerning Asir) decided that there could be no question of their declining to recognise the sovereignty of King Ibn baud over Asir, but that, in deference to the wishes of the Italian Government, they could agree to refrain from sending to the Hejazi Government a formal com munication of their recognition. The Italian Crovernment appear to have mis understood the purport of the Embassy's note. No. 296, of the 24th July, 1931, a copy of which was enclosed in Sir Ronald Graham s despatch No. 561 of the same date, and they appear to suggest in paragraph 5 of their note of the 23rd December last that the interpretation of the Embassy's note, which has now been given to them, involves some degree of conflict with statements made by the British representatives during the conversations held at Rome in 1927 regarding affairs in the Red Sea and South-Western Arabia. It was, indeed, precisely because there seemed some danger that the Italian Government might misunder stand the attitude which His Majesty's Government felt bound to adopt in 1931 in entering into correspondence with Ibn Sand's Government over Asir, and thus recognising by implication his sovereignty over that territory, that they felt it desirable to explain the position to the Italian Government beforehand. They can only regret that the Italian Government appear to have failed to understand the attitude underlying the course proposed by His Majesty's Government in the Embassy's note No. 296 of the 24th July, 1931, when they replied in their note of the 13th August, 1931, concurring therein. 7. In paragraph 3 of the Italian Government's undated note of December 1933, they refer to the 'well-known rights ' of the Imam over Asir. His Majesty's Government know of no good grounds for any claim which the Imam may have put forward before the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca to the area over which the Idrisi held sovereignty, and they therefore could not agree to any discussion with the Italian Government on the basis that the [mam had a reasonable claim to that area at the present time. 8. It will be seen from the preceding paragraphs that the attitude of His Majesty's Government, both regarding the legal status of Asir and also regarding the Imam's claims to that territory, is completely opposed to that of the Italian Government. This fundamental disagreement on two major questions is the first reason which leads me to consider it inexpedient to hold the proposed conversations. 9. In the second place, it appears from Sir Andrew Ryan's telegram No. 226 of the 29th December, which was repeated to you as my telegram No. 433 of the same date, that a measure of agreement in principle has now been reached between Ibn Saud and the Imam, and in particular that the Imam is prepared to recognise by treaty the existing position in Asir. If, as may legitimately be suspected, the chief motive of the Italian Government in refusing to recognise that position themselves is to maintain the Imam's unjustified claim to Asir in the^hope of strengthening their own influence with him, it would be inappropriate and, indeed, paradoxical that at the moment when the Imam himself is prepared to recognise King Ibn baud s position in Asir, the validity of that position should be discussed in the proposed conversations. Moreover, if the Italian Government were able to represent to the Imam that His Majesty's Government had agreed to discussion on this basis, the Imam would naturally form the impression that the status of Asir was still an open question, and would be encouraged to go backvjO J/ on the provisional agreement which he has apparently reached with King Ibn Saud and to revive his claims. The projected conversations would thus be likely actually to impede the prospect of a peaceful settlement in regard to Asir. They might also in the same way tend to make the Imam less ready than he might otherwise be to accept the apparently reasonable proposal which has now been put forward by King Ibn Saud for an agreement in regard to Nejran. 10. Thirdly, His Majesty's Government are anxious to maintain the relevant parts of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927 as the basis of Anglo-Italian relations in matters concerning the Imam of the Yemen and Ibn Saud. They do not wish to run any risk of this basis being called in question, by discussing any modification of these conclusions at the present time, having regard more especially to the advantages presented by conclusions 2 and 3, in virtue of which the Italian Government are under an obligation to use their influence with the object of restraining the Imam from aggression against Ibn Saud and to refrain from intervention in any conflict between the two rulers. In the third enclosure in your despatch, the Italian Government speak of these conclusions as the starting point of the proposed conversations. This does not entirely exclude the possibility of their modification being discussed, and this con sideration is, in my opinion, a further argument against embarking on the proposed discussions. 11. In sum, therefore, I see no advantage to be gained from agreeing to a meeting of experts in Rome to discuss the position in South-Western Arabia at a moment when, since King Ibn Saud and the Imam appear themselves to be moving in the direction of a desirable settlement, no discussion of the situation seems necessary; when His Majesty's Government are not in a position to discuss what the Italian Government erroneously profess to regard as the main issue, namely, Asir; and when His Majesty's Government desire to avoid any danger of the fundamental agreement between them and the Italian Government in regard to the Arabian coast of the Red Sea being disturbed. It seems that the proposed discussion would merely serve further to satisfy the Italian ambition to play the leading role among the Powers, without the justification on grounds of practical expediency which was present in the case of the Rome Conference, of my recent visit to Rome, and of the discussions there on the question of the Sudan-Libya boundary. 12. I accordingly request, in the light of the above considerations, that your Excellency will inform the Italian Government, in whatever manner you think least likely to provoke either an unfavourable impression or detailed and useless discussion, that His Majesty's Government consider that in the circumstances it would be unprofitable and possibly even prejudicial to the prospects of a direct settlement between King Ibn Saud and the Imam to hold the proposed conversations. 13.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that I received on the 23rd January your elegram No. 30, instructing me to inform the Italian Government unofficially of he communication which Sir Andrew Ryan had been authorised to address to 7 uad Bey Hamza concerning the threatened outbreak of hostilities in South-West Arabia. Since I had not yet taken action on your despatch No. 39 of the 5th January, instructing me to inform the Italian Government, in terms which vere left to my discretion, that His Majesty's Government were no longer jrepared to enter into conversations in Rome regarding the Arabian situation, t occurred to me that the two communications might suitably be combined in a )rivate letter to Signor Suvich, who, as you will remember, wrote to me personally m the 29th December, enclosing three notes verhales from the Ministry for foreign Affairs. 2. I accordingly addressed to his Excellency on the 24th January the )ersonal letter of which I now enclose a copy. You will observe that I have made ise of the discretion given me with the object, in the terms of your despatch under -eference, of avoiding the creation of an unfavourable impression or detailed and iseless discussion. In these circumstances, I trust you will not demur to my laving inserted a paragraph about the pressure of work in your Department, nore especially since the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs have been informed verbally on more than one occasion of the difficulty with which an expert could De spared and the considerable notice which would, in any case, have to be given before he was able to arrive in Rome. 3. As I pointed out in my telegram No. 22 of the 19th January, the Italian Grovernment are likely to be a little sore at the refusal of His Majesty's Govern ment to take part in the proposed conversations. It is fortunate, therefore, that I was able to gild the pill of refusal by the announcement of an intervention by 3ir Andrew Ryan in terms which I think the Italian Government will most certainly appreciate. I have, &amp;c. ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir E Drummond, to M. Suvich. My dear Minister, January 24, 1934. IN view of the interest which I know you take personally in the situation in South-West Arabia, I write to let you know that, according to our information, the prospects of a peaceful settlement between Ibn Saud and the Imam, which up bo a week or so ago appeared to be rather bright, have again become clouded, and that, in the opinion of our representative at Jedda, there is, unfortunately, now a very considerable danger of war breaking out. In view of this fact, and Bspecially since the situation seems to have become obscured by simple misunder standings on both sides when they were within sight of a reasonable settlement, Dur Minister to the Saudi Government was instructed yesterday to address a personal letter to Euad Bey Hamza, of which the following is a summary :— On the 13th January His Majesty's Government learned that the Resident at Aden had again urged on the Imam the desirability of a friendly settlement, and had been told, in reply, that negotiations were still progressing between the two countries. This seemed to correspond with information which had been [6 gg—1]2 supplied to our Minister by the Saudi Government themselves, even though agreement over the Najran still presented difficulties. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government, whose only object is to promote peace and stability in Arabia, are perturbed to learn that, before the arrival of a telegram despatched by the Imam on the 9th January, the heir apparent had been ordered to the front as a consequence of some local disturbance and that the Commander-in-chief in Asir had been instructed to advance. Although the advance of the latter appears to have been now countermanded, it seems that, as a result of some misunderstanding on each side as to the intentions of the other, there is a serious danger of an outbreak of hostilities. His Majesty's Government accordingly express the earnest hope that the Saudi Government, who have given so many proofs of their desire for peace, will do their utmost to avert the irreparable misfortune of war. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was to be asked to convey this message to the King, with an assurance that it was inspired by the friendliest motives, and that His Majesty's Government were ready to continue to use their good offices to promote an amicable settlement if the negotiations were continued. I feel that the Italian Government will appreciate the motives which have inspired this communication, and that, for their part, they will continue to use all their influence with the Imam to arrive at a reasonable settlement with Ibn Saud. In the circumstances explained above, and for certain other reasons which I shall proceed to describe, His Majesty's Government have come to the conclusion that it would not be desirable to proceed, for the present, with the proposed conversations referred to in the Ministry's note verhale of the 23rd December last, enclosed in your letter to me of the 29th December. One of the principal grounds for arriving at this decision has been the fact that, as emphasised in the Ministry's note verhale of the 23rd December, as well as in previous corres pondence on the subject, the points of view of the Italian and British Governments in regard to (a) the status of Asir, and (h) the Imam's claim to that territory, are obviously very far from reconciliation. My Government would, of course, be quite prepared still further to elaborate their own ideas on the subject if the Italian Government so desire, but for the moment the question seems to be to a certain extent academic. Moreover, while the actual position in South-West Arabia is still admittedly obscure, it is certain that up to a short time ago great efforts were clearly being made on both sides to arrive at an agreed settlement without recourse to war. In these circumstances it seems possible that the proposed conversations might be misunderstood locally and give rise to rumours which would impede, rather than facilitate, the peaceful solution of the dispute. In any case, my Government would find it difficult at this moment to send out a suitable expert from l^ondon, as the competent Department of the Foreign Office is extremely hard pressed. I hope that your Excellency will appreciate the force of the considerations which I have set forth above. Our two Governments may, and very likelv will, continue to differ in regard to the specific problem of Asir; but I am convinced that we shall continue to collaborate in regard to the larger question of the prevention of war, and I have some hope that the last demarche of our Minister, coupled with any representations which the Italian Government may, for their part, see fit to take with the Imam, may result in a successful solution of our difficulties.

() Although I took copies of the telegrams before returning , them, I think that you will find them at least as intelligible in this form as if 1 submitted even lengthier literal translations. 2. It is no new thing for Ibn Saud to cause sheaves of telegrams to be brought to the knowledge of the Legation by special emissaries. What is more unusual is that all the present telegrams are carefully dated, and that steps were taken to communicate to me the last and most important of them 1 within forty-eight hours of its despatch. I may add that Taufiq Bey, who has none of 10Ilgw | s his brother Fuad's experience and little of his assurance, appeared to be terribly e mk nerv0lis - He speaks French quite passably, but he begged me to provide an he nr interpreter, although he had nothing to do except to hand me the texts for perusal «ta! and return - 3. I do not feel that at this stage 1 can add anything useful to the comments K contained i 11 m y telegram under reference. The situation seems to be approaching some sort of a denouement, and will probably have taken on a quite new aspect by the time you receive this despatch. I need only call your attention to the fact that the correspondence, judged by the references and internal evidence, does not appear to be quite complete. There is much about incidents in the frontier region, but little to indicate their exact nature. 4. You are aware that the Jebel Faifa is extremely marginal. In this connexion I may refer back to paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 23 of the 17th January, 1933. 5. Taufiq Bey left the telegrams with me on the understanding that I should tow ie ^ urn them to him as soon as possible. Before I could do so, however, he decided I not to wait, and requested me to send the texts after him under cover of a personal !v ' letter. This gave me an opportunity of writing next day a letter, of which I enclose a copy^ 1 ) and of expressing in it my hope that the local incidents would be smoothed over, so as to enable the conference to meet in favourable conditions. ■ j 6. I still hear of great military activity in connexion with the collection !Uu of motor transport and the mobilisation of further troops. There is said to be much^recruiting in the Northern Hejaz and the adjoining parts of Nejd, ' f a ^ With reference to the concluding portions of paragraph 5 of my despatch II 1 No. 15 of the 23rd January, and paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 26 of the n t:. January, I now learn from two independent sources, of which Mr. Philby ii * * is one, that the Amir Feisal went three or four days ago to hunt at a place not far f, 0 irom Medina. This is unexpected news, as I rather thought that the Amir might tio' 1 leave Taif for the south at any moment. It is barely possible that the report of i# north is a blind, but it is hardly in the Saudi manner to use such a device 1- - rather than to maintain silence. Mr. Philby suggests that the Amir and the l^ing may intend to meet, though not in the direction he at first suggested. He still says that the Amir is eager to go south, but that, in his opinion, the King will not let him go. As for myself, I am still greatly interested in the prince's niovements, but I prefer to hazard no surmise as to the ultimate intentions of either father or son in this respect. a i ^ an ! sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's Ambassador in Rome and His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden.

[E 501/76/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Si?' John Simon.—{Received January 22, 1934.) (No. 371. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, December 30, IN my telegram No. 227 of to-day's date I have summed up briefly my conversations with my French colleague and Fuad Bev Hamza regarding the visit of the former, in the company of the latter, to Riyadh.' It may interest you to have a fuller account of this episode. 2. As reported in Mr. Calvert's despatch No. 359 of the 12th December, M. Maigret and Fuad Bey started on the 11th December, two days before my own return to Jedda. They reached Riyadh on the morning of the 15th December and left again on the 18th December, getting back to Jedda and Mecca respectively on the 21st December. 3. M. Maigret lay very low, as his custom is, until the 27th December. On that day a telephone message from me asking whether he had returned elicited the offer of a visit. When he came, he first gave me some interesting general impressions. He contrasted Sana, a place where one merely got back to the Middle Ages, with Riyadh, which might be a Babylonian city of 5,000 or 6,000 years ago. all sun-dried bricks and silence, in a setting of illimitable desert. 4. I observed presently that M. Maigret's journey had been the subject of much comment. In order to draw him out, I cited, half-jestingly, the rumours that a Saudi prince was to sit on the Syrian throne, that negotiations regarding the Hejaz Railway were in progress, or that France was intervening in the quarrel between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. 5. M. Maigret endorsed my own sceptical comments on rumours so fantastic and proceeded to tell me, with an air of great frankness, what he represented as the whole truth. He had a passion for visiting out-of-the-way places. He had a great sympathy for this country. He intended to write a book. His Government had authorised him to go to Riyadh, and he had gone there on the invitation of Ibn Saud. He had undoubtedly talked politics with the King, but only European politics. France had no political interest in Arabia, except in so far as her position in Syria raised certain questions, e.g., in regard to tribes, and intensified her concern with Moslem affairs. His Government always impressed on him the necessity for a discreet avoidance of mixing up in Arabian politics. And so on and so on, for a pleasant hour or more. 6. It is quite true that M. Maigret, who hardly leaves his house while in Jedda, has a great taste for distant travel in the East. I had been prepared, for this reason and because I do not believe him to ' cut much ice ' with his own Government, to discount the importance of his trip to Riyadh. Nevertheless, his statement left one thing unexplained, namely, why the Saudi Government had authorised the visit. The ban on non-Moslem access to Riyadh has been slightly relaxed this year, witness the recent visit of Mr. Twitchell, but the reception there of any foreign diplomatic representative is a portent. 7. On the 28th December Fuad Bey came to see me for the first time since my return. Our first subject of conversation was M. Maigret's adventure. I trotted out the same three rumours, with much the same comments as before, and added a vague reference to suggestions that the French Government might be prepared to give some kind of material assistance to Ibn Saud. Fuad Bey expatiated on M. Maigret's love of travel, his desire to write a book and his great iriendliness towards this country and Islam. He dealt systematically with my collection of rumours. There was no present question, he said, of a Saudi candidature for the Syrian Throne. There could be no such question so long as the French were committed to a policy in Syria which turned on its having a republican constitution, and any modification of which would raise complicated questions, among them that, of securing' the assent of the Leasrue of Nations. Ifin their minds to do, they would approach His Majesty's Government in the first instance. All that had happened so far was that his own replies to inter*iew6rs in Egypt had had a repercussion in Syria, where he had been asked many questions and been led to engage in very general conversations of an informal kind. He dismissed more briefly any idea of French intervention in the quarrel with the Imam. 8. Fuad Bey went on to say that there was, none the less, a business side to M. Maigret's journey. After obtaining my promise that what he was about to say would be regarded as highly confidential, he explained that when he was in Paris with the Amir Feisal in the spring of last year, certain questions had been broached. Conditions in Paris made it impossible to pursue them at that time. The French had tried later to communicate with him at The Hague and Berlin, but he was already in Moscow when they got into touch with him. Skipping d long interval, he said that eventually the French Government had charged M. Maigret to communicate their views on the desiderata put forward by the Saudi mission last year. They related to war material, a loan and a mission to help with military organisation and the Saudi air force. It had been decided to invite M. Maigret to convey the French reply to the King at Riyadh. 9. Fuad Bey was much less precise as to the messages which my French colleague had brought. His language generally, rather than any definite state ment, implied that the negotiations were approaching a happy close. As I have stated in my telegram under reference, he mentioned financiers, and not the French Government, as the providers of the prospective loan, and he said that the mission, though recruited under the auspices of the French Government, would be of a civilian character. 10. Fuad Bey assured me more than once that these dealings with thfc French implied no departure from his Government's policy of friendship with His Majesty's Government. He reminded me lightly and amiably of their failure to obtain from British sources the help they needed. T said that we could not criticise the action of the Saudi Government in cultivating French friendship, and begged him to believe that my desire for information was inspired by interest and not by jealousy. I did not comment otherwise on his statement, except for a passing remark, when he mentioned the proposed military mission, that I thought the Saudi Government had been looking to Turkey about a year ago for this kind of assistance. !uad Bey replied, with a slight and perhaps unintentional lapse from strict accuracy, that there had only been a question of sending voung meii to be trained in that country. • i. ^A ssum i n S ^ lia&lt; ^ Bey's explanation to have been generally in accordance with the facts, and he was not only more precise but also more convincing than my French colleague, it remains to be seen what advantages the French Government expect rn return ior their benevolence. I have no means of obtaining information on t is subject. My general view is that there will be little reason for perturM- tron, even if the negotiations do in fact produce concrete results. Despite my regard and admiration for Ibn Saud, I have still to discover that, in his dealings w i } ^uTOpean Powers or commercial interests, he ever gives much that is solid or o c urable value for what he receives. I have never thought, for instance, that a Vr^bia^ ^ ^ air 6 Can h0pe f0r mUCh 0f a ' cinch ' on the air of SaU(li ^ tt ^ 1 , a (&gt;0 Py 0 / this despatch to His Majesty's representative in Pans and His Majesty's consular officers at Beirut and Damascus I have, &amp;c.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 22.) Sir, Jedda, January 2, WITH reference to your despatch No. 333 of the 14th December, I have the honour to state that, in my opinion, any claim by the Saudi Government to : Hodeida on the ground that it was formerly Idrisi territory would be untenable, as untenable as the suggestion that the Idrisi could not validly cede rights further Mali north to Ibn Saud, without the Imam's consent. When Fuad Bey spoke to ;| et Mr. Calvert of the possibility of a claim to Hodeida, he would appear to have been using it merely as a makeweight in his demonstration of the reasonableness 11 j ®: of Ibn Saud. I am confirmed in this appreciation by a conversation which I defiif myself had with Fuad Bey on the 29th December. I pointed out to him, among )se. is other things, that Hodeida was in fact in British occupation for over three s, audi- months after the date assigned in the Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of 1926 to the earlier lesaiii treaty between Ibn Saud and the Idrisi. The date of that treaty is given as the irnmii 10th Safar, 1339, or about the 22nd October, 1920. The British forces evacuated Hodeida, which the Idrisi thereupon occupied, at the end of January 1921. I lings lii cannot discover that the Idrisi had at any previous time held Hodeida, although dsliipffi he had been given possession of Loheya soon after the armistice with Turkey, ieir Ml according to the Survey of International Affairs for 1925, vol. I, p. 320. we li According to p. 322 of the same volume, he was compelled to evacuate Loheya rienii early in 1925 and Hodeida on the 27th March of that year. So far as Hodeida is )y iflte concerned, therefore, he would appear not to have been in possession either on the .except of the Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of 1920 or on the date of the subsequent treaty of ikill 1926. 3 fori 2. I agree that it is very difficult to apply legal tests to the claims and flntid counter-claims as to how the frontier between what is now Saudi Arabia and the nff vol Yemen should be drawn. Some rational conclusions may, however, be deducible from a study of the history of the Yemen and Asir since 1872, when the Turkish inaffi Government included both in the newly constituted Vilayet of the Yemen, (icingi though they separated them, to the best of my belief , between 1908 and 1911. I [iGofff ^ ave cer tain reasons for the latter belief in a memorandum which I wrote in ffinfoFi London before returning from leave, but of which I have no copy. Such enquiries forptf I have been able to make since tend to confirm it. I have before me a calendar Deft Turkish for the Turkish financial year 1327 (the 14th March, 1911, to the nhisk ^ a rch, 1912), which, though unofficial, shows clearly that, at that time, there were on ^ t ^ 0 out tyi n g sanjaks of the Yemen Vilayet, viz., Hodeida and Taiz, j and that Asir was already an 'independent' sanjak, i.e., one directly under parf ^ ons tantinople, though not administered by a Vali. 3. I am at present engaged in an attempt to put together in outline an le# historical study of the kind indicated in the preceding paragraph. If Ibn Saud and the Imam come to a real settlement in the near future it may not be worth while to pursue this rather difficult task. Should I complete it, I will venture Bll to the results for verification and correction by experts. For the moment I content myself with drawing your attention to the fact that the handbooks drawn up by the Arab Bureau and the Admiralty in 1916-17 describe the Wadi Ain, which falls into the sea at parallel 16°, as the then limit of Idrisi expansion., In my opinion, any subsequent extension of the Idrisi's authority further to the south must be regarded as having been in the nature of a purely temporary occupation. I think it will be found, though I am not in possession of the whole correspondence, that even when His Majesty's Government allowed the Idrisi to occupy first Loheya and then Hodeida, they were unwilling to commit them selves to the position that these places were being assigned to him permanently. Having regard to all that has happened since, I should say that the reasonable he of a frontier towards the sea would be somewhere from the Wadi Tashar to the .Wadi Ain. [6 y-i]I &amp; While the foregoing observations may appear to be at once meagre and cursive, I think they provide the best approach to the specific matters, on which vou have been good enough to consult me. Before dealing with them, I have to record one point which emerged from my conversation with Fuad Bey on the 29th December. When I mentioned the Wadi Tashar as being the terminal on the sea of the frontier, as described by the Saudi Government themselves last year (see my despatch No. 113 of the 14th April, 1933), Fuad Bey said that the actual frontier abutted on the sea a little further south, i.e., at a place called Muwassim, 8 kilom. north of Medi, and that that place was occupied by Saudi forces. This may account for the recent recrudescence of rumours, which, however, I still believe to be confounded, of clashes between Saudi and Yemeni forces in the immediate neighbourhood of Medi. Be this as it may, Fuad Bey's statement is important as a matter of precision, although it does not affect the main argument of the present despatch. 5. Although the Saudi-Idrisi Treaty of 1920 has not been published, I think it can safely be assumed that it had no bearing on the frontier between the territory remaining to the Idrisi and the Yemen. It is conceivable that Ibn Saud may have promised the Idrisi support in resisting encroachment by the Imam, but the only frontier that could have been definitely determined between the parties was an inland one, as the Idrisi was then treating as an independent ruler, with the Yemen to the south of him and the Hejaz to the north. It indeed seems probable that Ibn Saud and the Idrisi did not define the whole even of the inland frontier between them. In Mr. Mayers' despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 6 of the 19th January, 1927, Dr. Abdullah Damluji is described as having said that the treaty of 1920 ' only defined the north-south frontier in the Muhail-Abha region .... and did not attempt to make a partition between Asir and the territory of the Imam Yahya.' I derived the same impression from my conver sation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 29th December, and it is strengthened by a consideration of the situation at the time. Any agreement between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud, recognising the latter as ruler of portions of inland Asir bordering on the Yemen, might have precipitated a question between Ibn Saud and the Imam; but in 1920 Ibn Saud was pursuing another objective which made it specially important for him to disinterest the Idrisi in the Abha region. This was the absorption into his dominions of that region, in which the head of the former ruling family, the Beni Aidh, had made himself independent after the 1 uikish ev acuation at the end of 1918. Ibn Saud achieved this immediate obiect m 1922. * It appears to me fairly certain that Ibn Saud did not become seriouslv interested m the frontier between what is now Asir Tihama and the Yemen until c time oi the second treaty, which he made with the Idrisi in 1926. As he was +i ei T^ C ^ U1 u in i^i Iover what had been the Idrisi's territory, and as the Idrisi had been hard pressed by the Imam, it became important for Ibn Saud to make sure that he was getting all the territory to which the Idrisi could give fv. 1 t 'i ■ • i ag ? e u e ^ e transfer might be held to include territory from which Q a v. ^ on S fui ly ejected by the Imam, but for the reasons given in P ^ 0 P. , ov e' no t think that places like Hodeida, or even Loheya, couW t &lt;:&gt;r . now f having at any time been a part of the Idrisi's m y v 'ew what the Imam did in regard to those places in 1925 t i t i ■ ■ i possess ie Idnsi of what had lawfully been his, but to recover what tions sepm ^ f v a ^ imperrnanently occupied.

We I' ^ lo y t f 1 ^ Saud claims to have come to an agreement with the Imam about ^ the frontier inland at the end of 1927. The most precise account of this is given ^ X 1° the 28th Jul y last - Mr. Zada there states that on the 7th Rajab, 1346 (about the 31st December, 1927), the Saudi mission then m Sana made a proposal to the Imam's representatives, and that two davs later the latter accepted it, ' except where it related to the Idrisi territorv ' Even assuming the Saudi account of this affair to be correct, it is obvious that an exception m regard to Idrisi territory might be interpreted in various wavs. The tdnsi had ruled mountainous regions in inland Asir at the height of his power. Muhammad-bin-Dhulaim, who actually figured in the 1927-28 negotia tions as one of Ibn Saud's representatives, had previously been the Idrisi's 'ii nit J 0 ™''' 1 in the country of the settled Qahtan (see Admiralty Handbook of tr . ' P - . 4 P- 14 18 therefore evident that the words ' Idrisi territory ' i W* might have very different meanings for Ibn Saud and for the Imam. Anyhow ? the situation ran on until the autumn of 1931, when the Imam occupied Jebel Arwa, and precipitated some sort of a fresh frontier settlement. AH we know l 7 about this is that m December 1931 Ibn Saud renounced any claim to Jebel Arwa ep t and that his delegates signed what he regards as a treaty of friendship. &amp;c. This i* treaty, which, if ratified, was ratified in a very singular fashion, contains no floltli, reference to frontiers, and nothing has ever been published on this subiect, except 1 - the announcement of the relinquishment of Jebel Arwa by Ibn Saud. It may, I niii2s think, be said that there is a de facto frontier running inland from Muwassim lik to the north of Jebel Arwa and of Sada, but except as regards these two points, i Asm: the first of which Ibn Saud ceded in 1931, and the second of which he admits to '0™ be m Yemen, I think it would be unsafe, in the present state of our knowledo-e. trengtk to speak of either an understanding or a working agreement between the two TOitk rulers. Fuad Bey might well feel free to suggest that nothing was agreed to Asiri m 1931 which would affect Ibn Saud's right to Hodeida. But, as I have indicated Saudi above, I do not think the suggestion is meant to be taken seriously. It would. Mm m my opinion, become important only if Ibn Saud were negotiating with the regit Imam after a successful war. beidr 9- The historical review foreshadowed in paragraph 3 above will, if dent m completed, deal to some extent with Nejran. That subject is not relevant to the mkt Present despatch, but I may say for the sake of completeness that I doubt whether. s |!l ce the latter part of the eighteenth century, any of the rulers mentioned in comesff this despatch, whether Turks, Imam, Idrisi or Ibn Saud have ever established a ieYen P 0 ®, 1 ^ 011 ^he region of the Wadis Nejran and Habuna sufficiently dominant lg and durable to serve as the basis of a solid claim to sovereignty. This view seems ■ritonJ to underlie Ibn Saud's suggestion that it should be regarded as a sort of buffer forli 01 neutral territory between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, a solution which, in mv risiffll 0 P ir ^ on ' has much to commend it. 10.

Jedda, January 5, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Report on Heads of Foreign Missions at Jedda. (Paragraphs marked with an asterisk are reproduced from the report submitted in January 1933.) A fghanistan. SALAHUDDIN KHAIN SALJUQI, the Afghan consul in Bombay, arrived in Jedda on the 16th March, 1933, and obtained a Saudi exequatur as consul here with effect from the 11th April. It was understood to be the intention of the Afghan Government, when making this first appointment to Jedda, to do no more for the time being than to detach Salahuddin Khan for service in the Hejaz during the pilgrimage season. He stayed at the local hotel and took an unexpectedly early departure on the 25th April, leaving a clerk in charge of current business. I had no opportunity of cultivating his acquaintance after his first visit, when he struck me as a well-educated man, with a special inclination for philosophy. He spoke English passably and was understood to have a good knowledge of classical Arabic. His age is probably about 45. I gathered that before being sent to Bombay, in or about 1931, he had been little outside his own country, where he had been educated and had held a succession of official posts, including that of secretary to King Amanullah. Egypt. # Hafiz Amer Bey has been Egyptian consul since March 1931, but was absent from Jedda from September 1931 until June 1932, and again from early November 1932 until the end of the year. He lacks previous diplomatic or consular experience, having been formerly an advocate at Tantah, his home town, and having later held minor judicial posts in Egypt. He is said to owe his position to the protection of Emin Yehia Pasha, brother of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs^ 1 ) He speaks English imperfectly and French very sketchily. Up to August 1932 he was by way of being very frank and friendly with the British Legation, and indulged at every turn in fulsome compliments, especially in intercourse with my wife and lady visitors. His frankness was chiefly shown in a rather tactless inquisitiveness, and I have had reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendliness. He is an ardent Moslem, strict in observance. Soon after he came here he formed a very poor opinion of the Wahhabi regime, and does not conceal his dislike of it. He is repaid by suspicion, which, in June 1932, was pushed to the length of a definite accusation of complicity in the plots behind the then rebellion in the Northern Hejaz. There is no evidence, as far as I am aware, in support of this accusation. Nevertheless, Hafiz Bey's sympathies are certainly with the enemies of Ibn Saud. He is hardly the man for the difficult task of promoting a rapprochement between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. C) The Minister for Foreig-n Affairs mentioned above, Abdul Fatah Pasha Yehia, is now Prime imster of Egypt bnt there is reason to believe that Hafiz Bey's attaches are with the Palace, rather an with any particular Egyptian Goverument. [6 gg—3]Ll He ;f i will ®r£ Hafiz Bey spent more time in Jedda in 1933 than he had done in the two preceding years, but was little m evidence at the Butish Legation and is seldoin met in other European circles. He is, perhaps, more restrained in his sentiments than he was. When we do meet he evinces great anxiety to please. His wife and family have never come to Jedda. France. *M. Roger Maigret holds the position of permanent Charge d'Affaires, but the French Government have shown unwillingness to make his post more than a consulate, despite the conclusion of a general treaty with Ibn Saud in November 1931. He is a man of perhaps 60, and has had a long career in the French Near East service. He was employed in Morocco for many years prior to 1921, and appears to have had only a moderate reputation there. He was subsequently consul- general in Iraq. He is intelligent and witty, has a considerable knowledge of Arab countries, and boasts in his lighter moments of an equal knowledge of the Parisian underworld, as a result of having cultivated apaches in his conscript days. When I first knew him he was always very ready to talk about Morocco, which we both knew, but was more reticent about affairs nearer to us, notwith standing professions of friendship which were sometimes almost 'smarmy.' I found him rather more communicative in 1932, but we met rarely during my short stays here, as M. Maigret seldom leaves his house, except to leave Jedda, and eschews social intercourse almost completely. His health is poor and he was much taken up with an aged mother until her death in August 1932. He does not appear to carry much weight with Saudi officials, whom he found incon ceivably tiresome when negotiating his treaty. He is understood to have a considerable book knowledge of English, and has translated Mr. Philby's Arabia into French. M. Maigret continues to go abroad very little in Jedda, but excited a good deal of interest in December 1933 by visiting Riyadh ostensibly to gratify his passion for distant travel and to obtain material for a book. He is known to have had other objects, but himself kept up the pretence throughout a very friendly and apparently frank conversation with me on his return. He is a permanent grass-widower, but is understood to console himself with the society of a permanent lady guest, who occasionally makes discreet appearances elsewhere, e.g., at a fancy-dress ball in an English house on New Year's Eve, whicn M. Maigret himself attended (in ordinary attire) to the surprise of all. Germany. Ihe German consulate is to all intents and purposes vacant. The titular incumbent M.

He has appeared little in society since he was joined recently by his wife, a lady who 1(1 j?' is almost invisible, except when cars pass in the desert. No further account le need be given of M.

Habibullah Khan Hoveyda, who had been Persian representative for some 1V!! - years, left Jedda to his infinite joy in December 1933, leaving the Legation in 11 - charge of his vice-consul, M.

When ^ • we do see each other, we never approach any kind of political subject, but exchange i j yolitesses and simple stories. In this sort of talk M.

I think that he is genuinely more interested in com- v m^cial and economic subjects than in politics, and is content to devote himself r o the uphill task of marketing Russian goods (he did an important deal in !f S/ euin P ro ducts in 1931, but is still whistling for the money), and securing it; e removal of the restrictions still imposed by the Saudi Government, in e t on direct trade with Russia.

Celal Bey has been Turkish Charge d'Affaires for a little over a year, in which time he has spent about eight months here. He was formerly an army officer and did part of his service in the Yemen up to the time of the Turco-Italian War. He is now a man of perhaps 45 or more. He seems to know Arabic well, and, I believe, speaks Italian, but his French is elementary. He entered the Turkish foreign service some years ago and before coming to Jedda had held consular posts at Rhodes. Damascus, Cyprus and, 1 think, Alexandropol. From the little I know of him I should judge him to be a pleasant and easy-going man, a superficially modernised example of the old Turkish school, not highly competent in any direction. If he has any impetuosity, he shows it in the handling of his wireless sets, which are powerful but very apt to go wrong under his management. His wife, a good example of the modern Turkish woman, not spoilt by progress, could not bear Jedda. Though apparently quite attached to him, she fled after a stay of barely a month to superintend the education of their son in Istanbul, and left Celal Bey to lead the simple life of an ancien militaire. This dispenses him from making any attempt to entertain while in Jedda, though he is reputed to be quite well off. ilE Op.

S ection 4. ^ Aral — tjj': [E 716/79/2S] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 30.) y ( No - 5 -) Sir, Jedda, January 10, 1934. FOR several days after I despatched my telegram No. 226 of the 29th December, there was in Jedda an almost uncanny dearth of news, or even rumours, ,, regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation. A few small straws in the wind seemed ■ to indicate vaguely that it might again be blowing up for war. A posse of well-known ulema arrived in Mecca from Nejd. The object of their visit might have been to stimulate martial ardour,-but this surmise is discounted by the fact that it is now Ramadan, a month which the devout like to spend wholly or partly in Mecca. The King's cousin Saud-al-Arafa (see personalities report 1 (23)), who had come to the Hejaz for that purpose, returned unexpectedly to Riyadh. This prince, though outwardly loyal, is believed to be somewhat ill-affected towards the King, and the latter might well like to keep him under his immediate eye, if His Majesty were starting on a distant expedition. Finally, the Emir Feisal, who had promised to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Philby on the 7th January, postponed the engagement at short notice until the 9th, in order to go once more to Taif to review the troops there. 2. The Amir came from Taif to Jedda on the 8th January for the usual dinner in honour of the King's accession. Fuad Bey Hamza came down for the same event, and I had a conversation with him on the 9th January. He described the situation as still uncertain. He stated that some days earlier war had appeared imminent. The King, however, in his eagerness for peace, had made a further concession by proposing to leave the question of Najran in suspense pending a meeting of delegates at Sana or elsewhere, perhaps a place near the frontier, who could discuss the question at the same time that they recorded in treaty form the agreement already reached in principle regarding the de facto frontier between Asir and Yemen and the disposal of the Idrisi. Fuad Bey said that he was himself to attend the conference, if it took place, a decision which would appear to indicate the King's wish to ensure precision in any written agreement, as Fuad Bey has had a greater experience of negotiations on civilised lines than any of Flis Majesty's present advisers. 3. At the outset of the conversation Fuad Bey referred to the Imam's intrigues among the Beni Malik, as though this grievance still existed or had recently revived, but he presently dismissed it as a subsidiary matter. He complained generally of the impossibility of getting straight answers from the Imam, who indulged freely in evasive verbiage. He was unable to tell me anything more about the actual situation in Najran. I questioned him guardedly as to the report reproduced in the penultimate sentence of my telegram No. 226 of the 29th December, describing it simply as a rumour which I had heard. Fuad Bey admitted that certain elements near the frontier, who were co-operating with Ibn Saud but did not form part of his organised forces, had joined the local Najran tribes in repulsing the Yemenis. He said that there had still been no clash between the accredited forces of the two rulers, and that Ibn Saud had explained to the Imam the character of those concerned on his side. Although any such incident must necessarily be disquieting, I do not think that undue importance need be attached to this particular affair, as it does not seem to have interrupted the curious course of negotiations between principals. 4. We must still be prepared for all contingencies, but my present impres- sl on is that Ibn Saud is most anxious to avoid war. He may well think that ^ would be better in any case to postpone it, if it is to come, until the failure 0 i a formal conference of delegates had demonstrated clearly the impossibility or any reasonable agreement with the Imam. This policy is attended by one disadvantage, namely, that there is not much cool weather left for fighting. On the other hand, a break-down of negotiations on all the points at issue would [6 gg—4]enable the Kinff to present armed action in a more justifiable light to the Arab and Islamic worlds. It would also allow time for such pilgrims as intend to come to the Hejaz this year, but have not yet started, to get too well on the way to recede for fear of disturbances in the Holy Land. tt - ivt ^ ' 5 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His jVIajestA s i epresentcitive at Rome.

[E 1431/79/25] No. 1. Sir 1 A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 5.) (No. 41.) Sir, Jedcla, February 13, 1934. SINCE I wrote my despatch No. 33 of the 6th February there has been very little to report about the Saudi-Yemen situation, but it may be worth while to amplify the contents of my telegram No. 22 of the 12th February. 2. In paragraph 7 of my previous despatch I mentioned that the Amir Faisal had left Mecca in the first days of February, ostensibly on a hunting expedition. I have since heard that he went to a place called Hanakiya or Henakiya, which appears to be the place of that name shown in the maps some 60 to 80 miles north-east of Medina. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the permanent camel parks maintained by Ibn Saud as a definite part of his military organisation. I he camels are kept in large numbers at small expense in order to have mounts ready for troops in case of need. I am told that there are three such parks in the Hejaz. I have heard of another near Hail, and there are doubtless similar parks elsewhere. The Amir Feisal had not returned to Mecca up to 11th February, when he was, according to the Minister of Finance, at another place not far from Hanakiya. 3. My Indian vice-consul, who returned on the 11th February from a short visit to Mecca, found people there depressed and full of rumours of war. It was suggested that the Amir Feisal might proceed from the Medina area direct to Jizan and that the King himself would leave for the front about the end of this month at the head of forces recruited from the'' towns,' who are less likely than the Ikhwan and the tribesmen to be called out on minor occasions, but who would appear to constitute an important element in the army when it is mobilised for large-scale operations. Both the prince and his father were represented as being now engaged in great efforts to inflame the ardour of the tribes and to overcome the reluctance of some, e.g., it was said that portions of the Ajman and Mutayr had been brought to the Hejaz, but that the latter were unwilling to march. The Amir Feisal is said also to have been at great pains earlier to conciliate Ibn Rubaiyan, when the latter was at Taif some little time ago before leading his Ateyba to the south. 4. I need not multiply these reports and rumours. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah's personal observations and his information from intimate personal friends leave no doubt that warlike preparations of every kind are on foot, including measures to increase the number of recruits, to extract money from non- combatants and to provide transport, &amp;c. It does not follow that even now Ibn Saud wants war, but he is certainly acting as though he expected it, and he can hardly support indefinitely the strain entailed by his present preparations, whether it be the financial strain or the strain involved in keeping in the field large numbers of men, who might fight readily enough for the King, despite all that is said of his unpopularity, but who grow impatient if kept doing nothing. 5. I am aware that this picture is not unlike those that were painted at earlier stages of the quarrel. It is not so much the preparations themselves as their sustained intensity and the consideration that they cannot go on for ever that make me take a rather gloomy view T . What has impressed me most in the last few days has been the emphasis with which the Minister of Finance told me, on the evening of the 11th February, that neither side expected the Abha Conference to succeed. The Minister had come down from Mecca to receive the information wmch you had authorised me to give him about the promoters of the new bank scheme. He was in a mood to please, but when I asked him for news of the south, he affirmed and reaffirmed that no good could come of the conference. I asked him how things were going in the Jebel Faifa area. He gave no definite further information, but said that it was precisely because of what was happening there that he took the view he did of the prospects of the conference. He laid the blame on the complete untrustworthiness of the Imam. [56 e—2]6 I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of what Sheikh AbduM Suleiman said He has not been in personal contact with the K ing and would not necessarily be in Ibn Sand's confidence, if he were determined to make peace at all costs. ' Nevertheless, the Minister of Finance knows a great deal and he knows how other minds are working. Last week T was inclined to think that the chances of war and peace were about equal. Since the letum of the Indian vice-consul and my conversation with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, I have been inclined to increase the odds on war. i ^ tt- ivr • 4- ' \ u j • 7.

[E 1637/79/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 13.) (No. 55.) Sir ' T 1 , Jedda, February 28, 1934. IN my despatch No. 41 of the 13th February, I summed up my then most recent information regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation. Since that date there has been an extraordinary paucity of news or even rumours about what is happening. It can hardly be wondered at that, in all interested outside quarters, it should be thought that, to quote the Times of the 9th February, 'prudent diplomacy' in an 'Arabia Still Fortunate' has ended the crisis, and that nothing but the treaty-making remains. The Saudi Government themselves seem to have been anxious to foster this idea, witness the announcement on p. 13 of the Times of the 8th February, a variant of which was given about the same time to the Egyptian press. 2. The announcement just mentioned suggests either of two things. Ibn Saud may be so averse from war that he is determined to make the Abha Conference a success at all costs, or he may be expecting war but anxious to be able to represent it in due course as due to the Imam's intractability in a general negotiation which promised to be successful. At the moment it is impossible to know what has been passing at Abha. The Amir Feisal returned from the camei parks about the 15th February and came to Jedda on the 18th for four days. When I saw him on the 20th he professed to have had no news from Abha, since that of the arrival of the Yemeni delegation; although three clear days had elapsed, and there is no reason to believe that wireless communication has been interrupted. The Prince replied rather vaguely to a question about the position in the mountain area peopled by the Beni Malik, &amp;c., but I understood him to say that he thought that the Yemeni forces had withdrawn. 3. Mr. Philby, who returned from Mecca three days after my conversation with the Amir, had heard nothing further about the negotiations, and he told me last evening that according to the Minister of Finance there was still no news. It seems hardly credible that the two Ministers most concerned should remain completely in the dark for over a week, but it is possible that the King is keeping the matter in his own hands at Riyadh, and it is conceivable, though less probable, that he has given full discretion to the heir apparent. 4. Meanwhile, the Saudi military preparations have continued. There appears to have been activity up Medina way about the time of and just after the Amir Feisal's excursion in that direction. One thousand one hundred men from the north are reported to have gone south by motor lorry at that time. Ford lorries bought through Mr. Philby's firm were being hurried off to Mecca as soon as they could be assembled, without undergoing any road test. Two of the motor barges sent to Jizan some time ago returned to Jedda on the 19th February and put to sea again two days later. The third was delayed on the return voyage, but reached Jedda later and left for Jizan on the 24th February with another party of some 200 troops. 5.

Andrew Mecca, January 28, 1934. I AM writing to you just before I leave Mecca for Abha in order to acknowledge your private letter of the 23rd January, 1934 i^ bo ' t , the ^^rsSion of the situation between this country and the Yemen. e a truth of on this question on Wednesday last, which I believe has shown j ou the truth ot the matter and has made clear that the measures tahen wm-e by waj ot preparation for eventualities, once it had been proved to us t^t the actions ot Imam Yahya were at variance with his statements. I b® co in Hi cat pel the of your letter, referred to above, to the proper person, and ave chnuld explanations I made to you. It was then found mos appiopn ' summarise the recent situation for you as follows . Our attitude as regards our desire for peace and frie ' d ^P ™ Imam Yahya remains unchanged. Our pi'oofof thi® is e _ , while have strongly urged the Imam Yahya to have the difficu y 10u o . . f a ^ en all our forces are concentrated on the frontiers and en 116 ^ i:,ea J' i y i nc | no action, thank God, which might provoke a quarrel between us and Yahya, a^ in spite of our having ascertained that while he was , P , HnifiP- the compacting with us for peace and friendship he was, on e o ei , . , ^ ^ opposite by provoking insurrection in the lihama area, i action he is Wahhab-al-Idrisi, who is under his protection an 0^+3^8 of the responsible, gave him money and arms and thus stirred U P the Abadil highlands of the Tihama such as the Ahl Faifa, the Bern until they expelled those of our Amirs who were with em jpf™™ a settle- from the people of those mountains. The Imam s m 1°^ nnnor f lin itv he will ment is to cause insurrection and strife so that^if he n s a , ^ frankly break the peace and do whatever he likes. His the K ng has tianki&gt; acquainted Yahya with the facts and strengthened the forces with extra ones in [31 n—3]2 preparation for eventualities. He has also issued his orders to his Highness the Amir Saud to proceed to that quarter for two reasons Firstly. —To prevent our forces from any act of aggression, particularly after the Imam Yahya had broken (his) promise, when we feared that our tribes would retaliate. Secondly.— To modify the system of war m preparation for eventualities. The advance of the forces from our side to the vicinity of the frontier was due to the fact that the people of that area, for example the Masariha, the Beni Shubeyl and the Al-Mareth, who are close to the frontier, had shown our Amir subversive letters which they had received from the Idrisi and from some of the Imam Yahya's officials. It was thus found inevitable to advance as far as Samta in order to reassure them and to prevent insurrection, and also to fortify our posts in the mountain district, also in preparation for eventualities. What seems most probable is that the position will be altered by the insurrection which the Imam Yahya is stirring up. It is therefore not unlikely that incidents will occur as actually did happen with Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi, particularly because all the people of the Tihama who are subjects of Imam Yahya are saying that the Imam wants peace negotiations only to deceive so that he can subsequently find an opportunity to break his engagements. Despite all this His Majesty's orders are continually issued to prevent any advance to the frontiers of the Yemen. The situation will remain the same until the conclusion of the conference which is to be held at Abha, whether or not that conference succeeds. If, however, there occurs a definite act of hostility on the part of the Imam Yahya, we shall then have to defend ourselves. Yours sincerely, FUAD HAMZA.THIS DO CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN ( A rabia ). February 13, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 2. of tiefi tie ly [E 985/79/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received February 13.) (No. 22.) Sir, Jedda, January 27, 1934. IN my despatch No. 15 of the 23rd January, I brought the story of the latest phase of the quarrel between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya up to the afternoon of the 23rd January, when Mr. Calvert handed to Fuad Bey Hamza the personal letter, a copy of which I enclosed in that despatch. There is little of importance to add to what I have telegraphed regarding the later developments, but as Fuad Bey is leaving for Abha to-morrow (not to-day, according to a telephone message he sent me this morning) this is a convenient moment to bring the subject WaWI up to date. ctsoffe 2. Fuad Bey read my letter in Mr. Calvert's presence. Before doing this eivesoil he informed him of his projected visit to Abha, of which I had heard from Mr. Philby the evening before, and asked whether Mr. Calvert could put him in led top the way of borrowing a sextant, as he hoped incidentally to do something to clarify aintki the geography of those regions. In the course of subsequent conversation he stated Mm that the Yemeni delegate who was to meet him was Seyyid Abdullah Ibn Wazir, 3f Wli who until recently was in command of the Imam's forces on the Asir Tihama is, front. Fuad Bey expressed himself hopefully about the projected meeting and ncerek described his outlook as 'optimistic,' although, when using the word a second TAD M time, he rather qualified it. He did not refer to the movements of the heir apparent or to other matters of detail. He promised to convey my letter to the King by telegraph next day and to acquaint me with His Majesty's reply. 3. I had been anxious not to meet Fuad Bey personally until he had received my letter. He called on me by arrangement on the morning of the 24th January and we discussed the situation fully on the lines reported in my telegram No. 11 of that day. I enclose a fuller account of our conversation, not including the sketch map referred to, which was merely a rough and extempore attempt to illustrate what Fuad Bey was telling me. 4. Fuad Bey returned to Mecca that afternoon. When we parted he thought it unlikely that lie would start for Abha before the beginning of February, and even spoke of the possibility of another visit to Jedda. On the 25th January, however, he telephoned that he had had to expedite his plans and would be leaving for Abha on the 27th. I expressed satisfaction at this, as it is obviously desirable in the present highly electrical conditions that the meeting should take place as soon as possible. A few minutes later, he again telephoned to announce that the heir apparent had reached Abha on the 23rd January. 5. The Umm-al-Qura of yesterday published a brief announcement regarding the proposed meeting at Abha, giving the names of the two principal delegates and their dates of departure to attend the meeting. The object of the nieeting was categorically described as being '' the conclusion of the treaty referred to in the leading article in the last issue.' . u j a ui. 6. The same IJmm-al-Qura announces that the heir apparent reached Ablia on the 24th January, i.e., one day later than Fuad Bey had said; that he has assumed command there; and that he was accompanied by five junior princes. The fact that the Amir is to be definitely in authority at Abha is significant. As you will see by the enclosed record, Fuad Bey stressed the importance oi sending to the south a personage of sufficient standing to take decisions. It is possi e that the King has delegated to the prince wide powers to make either peace or war. 7. It is clear that the statement of the views of His Majesty s Governmen which I conveyed to Fuad Bey on the 23rd January, has m no way atlected tne course of events. I still consider it satisfactory, however, that the statement should have been made, especially as Fuad Bey exhibited no sort of resentment a your intervention. His attitude throughout his conversation with Mr. ^alvert and myself was eminently friendly and sensible. When speaking to Mr. Calvert he again manifested much curiosity as to Colonel Reilly s proceedings at bana^ and expressed spontaneously the hope that they would terminate in a success. [31 n—2]2 8. I have no further news regarding Saudi military preparations. The three barges are still lying peacefully off Jedda. The most significant pieces of information given me by Fuad Bey were that, when war seemed imminent, it was intended to send the 'Amir Feisal, the King's son, to the front, and that Ibn Rubaiyan, the Ateyba leader, had marched south. You will have seen from the Koweit intelligence reports that this chieftain was, in the autumn, supposed to be more than half-hearted, but eventually decided to obey the King. Early in the month it was widely rumoured that the Ateyba at Taif were in a rebellious mood and were even creating disturbances in the town. Whatever the facts, the Amir Feisal has gone personally to Taif two or three times since the beginning of January. It may well be that Ibn Rubaiyan's Ateyba have latterly been not so much disaffected as impatient for action. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty's Ambassador in Rome and to the Commissioner at Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Note respecting the Saudi-Yemen Situation. FUAD BEY HAMZA called on me this morning. We had a long conversa tion, parts of which were rather involved. The following, though not an exact record, gives the gist of what passed ;—■ Fuad Bey confirmed what he had told Mr. Calvert yesterday afternoon about his proposed journey to Abha to meet a representative of the Imam. I asked whether this was to be the actual conference which had been foreshadowed or merely a preliminary. Fuad Bey said that, in the intentions of his Government, it was to be the conference. He added in reply to a further question that he would have colleagues, but he did not name them; nor did he appear to know of any Yemeni delegate other than Seyyid Abdullah Ibn Wazir, the general who has been in command at Haradh and who has now been called to Sana. News of this gentle man s departure for Abha was awaited, and Fuad Bey would then proceed. He Avas to go from Mecca by car via Bisha. He hoped to vary his route coming back and to do some geographical work, but sounded doubtful as to whether he would venture as far as Najran for this purpose. I told Fuad Bey that [ had been completely mystified by the apparent discrepancies oetween the Umm-al-Qura article of the 16th January, and what he ad told me 1 said that 1 now reduced the areas in dispute to three, although there might be more. Firstly, there was Asir Tihama. Here Ibn Saud was in a strong position, and my only difficulty was that we had never been told what the inland boundary of Asrr Tihama was. The Saudi Government appeared to be unwilling to supply this information, though I had given him frequent opportunities of tellmg me the effect of the Saudi Idrisi Treaty of 1920.

The fact was that at am actl 5 )ns were quite at variance with his activities among the Beni Malik andVh^Ti the 9th Januar y the ^ main H 1 Mallk and Abadil had gone the length of invasion and^ occupation, and his forces were accompanied by Seyyid Abdul Wahhab al-Idrisi, 1111% despite the Imam's promise to relegate the Idrisis to Zebid. It was in consequence fromj of these activities, which had created a storm of indignation in Saudi circles, that 11 arrangements had been made for the Amir Saud to go to the front and for his 1%; brother the Amir Feisal (for it was to him and not to Feisal-bin-Saud that the ieftu Vmm-al-Qura referred), to go south also. War seemed inevitable, and it was 'rein necessary that a person of the heir apparent's authority should be on the spot to verlj,,' take decisions. He had gone off on a date of which Fuad Bey said he was himself ignorant, taking one of Sir F. Humphrys's wireless sets on which he could receive messages, but which could not transmit more than 200 miles. His objective was Bisha, but up to last evening there was no news of his arrival there. He would 0 1| probably get there about now. Meanwhile, reassuring telegrams had come from the Imam and the Abha meeting had now been arranged. The trouble was that, when he sent his messages, the Imam had not discontinued his activities in the Beni Malik and Abadil country. The King, showing amazing patience, had fallen back there in order to avoid a conflict. Military preparations were still in progress on the Saudi side owing to the ambiguousness of the Imam's attitude. The troops embarked here on the 16th January were part of the forces, which the Amir Feisal (Ibn Abdul-Aziz) was to have commanded. Ibn Rubaiyan, the Atayba leader, had also moved south from Taif. I observed that it was natural to suppose that the Amir Feisal mentioned by Umm-al-Qura as having been ordered to march along the Tihama, was the Commander-in-chief in Asir. I was glad to get the correction, but it would be even graver if the King's son, Feisal, had also been despatched. For the rest, I accepted Fuad Bey's explanations without much criticism and with sympathy, but said I had one complaint. I had been left to infer the importance of the Beni Malik and Abadil area in the recent stages. I looked for greater confidence than this showed. We had really done our utmost, more than he perhaps realised, to avert a conflict. We had used influence to restrain the Imam, indirectly—he knew what I meant—and then directly when the presence of Colonel Reilly at Sana gave us the opportunity. It was a condition of using influence with the Imam that we should use influence with Ibn Saud. We could only work with the Italians in ^ ^ friendly understanding, all the more so as the European situation required close collaboration with them. I had been really alarmed just after the 16th January lte lest war should be imminent and my Government had shared my alarm. Hence e ' the letter I had sent to him yesterday under instructions. Mr. Calvert, I said, had foreshadowed a written communication in the event of the issue of an ultimatum ' when it was thought that an ultimatum might be issued at any moment. The 'M E situation after the 16th January had presented an appearance so comparable in its dangerousness that the written communication had now been made. ^ Fuad Bey assured me of the King's pacific intentions. The King could not 1 put up with anything and everything, but he had astonished Fuad and others by ipF lis patience, e.g., by falling back in the Beni Malik and Abadil area. He himself, to; Fuad, was strongly desirous of peace. What the King held he must hold, but the country needed repose. They could not put their house in order if there were gefj always troubles. He would go to Abha full of the most sincere desire to arrive at was'- a settlement. I said that for my part I had been firm in the belief that there dm would be no war if the King could avoid it, and that all His Majesty's efforts were beii? 5 directed towards an honourable settlement. I admitted that the Imam was a very difficult person to negotiate with. I expressed confidence that every effort would be made on the Saudi side to reach a satisfactory conclusion at Abha and wished jet, I Fuad every success in his mission. loapf In the course of the conversation Fuad Bey showed me roughly on a map the sirT'- lie of the land. He traced the boundary between Asir Tihama and the Yemen in ar ticlf : a sort of S shape, starting eastward from the sea, then running northward so as jfos^ to leave the Jebel Razih on the Yemeni side and Jebel Faifa on the Saudi side j further north; then bending round again to the east. He placed the Abadil and the Beni Malik along this last bend, that is to say north of the Jebel Faifa. He # ™\f promised to send me a sketch map on the lines of the attached very rough P^cil sketch( 1 ) which he made to illustrate his explanation. ^ ^ ^:i ; | January 24,1934.

Having regard to Fuad Bey Hamza's statements to me on the 9th and 16th January, as reported by telegiap , I have seldom seen a more curious publication. Fuad Bey had told me on t e former date that Ibn Saud had made a fresh gesture of conciliation and that the Imam's reply to the King's latest proposals was awaited. He told me at midday on the 16th January, by telephone from Mecca, that this position was unchanged. Yet the Umm -al-Qura had produced that very morning the obviously inspire article with which I am now dealing. . . . • tj : 2' It is pretty clear that the question of Yemeni activities m the Bern Malik and Abadil area has come into the forefront of the dispute between Ibn Saud and the Imam. My maps and books of reference^ to locate that area, but it would appear to be somewhere X Jizan and Sada. As I stated in paragraph 3 of my des P a l ch ° f ^ e b 10th reference Fuad Bey started his conversation with me on the 9th January by a reterence to the Imam's intrigues among the Bern Malik, but he P re ? e ' 1 p eill ee importance. It is significant that, in the account given bj Colonel Reilly, see Foreign Office telegram No. 6 of the 17th January, o P r ' l I ) rientralisation of made by the Imam, he is represented as having asked for t ^ e ^ u ^ al ^ tl T d n the Beni Malik. It is also significant that mention s m the Aden Intelligence Summarv of the 20th December of a reported a PP ^ tl ™ &gt; y R Imam's commander at Haradh for sanction to march against the Jebel Ben, Mal t If the Vmm-al-Qura article be taken at its face value, it reads almost as though the heir apparent had gone ofl on his '' WT '', i, 8 'tornrct:! tion though that he started without a wireless set. I confess t a ? s , , The' Am'ir Saud it would rationalise the article, is intrinsically i m P ro r^; n , r at t i )e is reputed to be a bit of a fanatic, and his pub is e a PP . „ j „ time of the Ibn Rifada affair was an almost reproach ',,I cry of ^t « u P and at 'em '; but I have no other reason to suppose that he would defy a pa » T m' S U, - - on th. &gt;rj. the 19th January from iaudi^Telllment and he admitted that the to be in the inner secrets of the baudi Uovernmeni, anu uc however situation was most puzzling. He pooh-poohed t e ' 7 P' m h . did not think and said that he had not read it, and from what he had he^ it worth reading, and maintained stoutly that e , . . through Riyadh ..trltf,, 2^825 dismissed so lightly, especially as 11 h COul d p C ^L suggested that it was all sirs vusttur&amp;te ' rr; h .bt 5t«LTs fissf s-t o.—. had set about it in a very extraord mary ^^ which if confirmed, are 5. Mr. Philby gave two pieces the inner secret, he has more important than his opinions, tor, tnoug [31 n—1]many important contacts. He said that a meeting was to taike place at Abha between Fnad Bey Hamza and a representative of the Imam, and that Fuad Bey was only awaiting news of the Yemeni representative's movements before himself starting. Mr. Philby did not think, and represented Fuad Bey as not thinking, that this meeting could produce an agreement. He regards war as inevitable. His second bit of news was that both the King and the Amir Feisal his son, were going a hunting and that they were to meet. The Amir Feisal, he said, was made keen to go to the front, but had not been authorised to do so. Mr. Philby did not think that Ibn Saud would be persuaded to deprive the Hejaz of its Viceroy, but the convergence of the two hunts would take the King himself within easier distance of the front. 6. I regret that my information should be so imperfect. I share a general ignorance of what is really toward. Fuad Bey has lain low in Mecca since the 16th December, until to-day, when he arrived unexpectedly in Jedda about midday, and I could not put the questions 1 should like to ask him by telephone. Rumours reach me in waves, but they are of no value. The latest is that 8,000 of the Atayba have left Taif for the front. The only thing that I can at present see with my own eyes is three-fourths of the Saudi fleet, the three barges mentioned in my telegram No. 6 of the 16th January. It was generally supposed that they would follow the Besse steamer, which embarked anything up to 800 soldiers of sorts for Jizan on the 16th December; but they have continued to lie peacefully in full view of my house. 7. The one good result of all these singularities is that they enabled me, m spite of my earlier doubts, to suggest in my telegram No. 9 of the 21st January I a form of communication to Fuad Bey, which would show both the Saudi and the Italian Governments that His Majesty's Government were concerned to do what little they could do by words to attempt to restrain Ibn Saud from rushing into war. I received early this morning the telegram, in which you were good enough to approve of this suggestion. I enclose a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Fuad Bey. As I have said above he has arrived in Jedda unexpec e \ to-day The news reached me while my letter was heine prepared for signature and while I was drafting this despatch. Being anxious that the etter should reach him before we met, I arranged for Mr. Calvert to deliver it ' t 1 ) 11 P elsona J at ^ report any further developments as soon as i have myself seen Fuad Bey. rpnJLr^f 1 se f n ^ in ^ C0 P i f s of 1 th i s despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's hnvp nrp u f ^ p 01 ' 10 a to the Commissioner at Aden.

As regards the question of Najran, negotiations should be conducted in a conference to be held for that purpose by delegations from the two parties, with a view to settling it in such a manner as to preserve the interests of both and to prevent harm befalling them. There is still a strong hope that the proposed conference will overcome the difficulties and settle the trouble in a way which will preserve the interests of both parties as well as the interests of the people of Najran themselves. His Majesty the King sent this suggestion to his Highness the Imam Yahya on the 17th Ramadan (the 3rd January, 1934), but his Highness the Imam Yahya, as frequently happens, delayed his reply either accepting or refusing the suggestion. It happened during that time that certain of those in the mountains of the Tihamat Asir caused disturbances because of the intrigues of certain of his Highness the Imam Y^ahya's Amirs, which caused a bad effect, particularly in Nejd. Meanwhile, orders had already been issued to his Highness the Amir Saud, heir apparent of the Saudi Arab Kingdom, to march south with a Nejdi force; orders had likewise been issued to his Highness the Amir Feisal to march south along the Tihama coast. On the 23rd Ramadan (the 9th January, 1934), however, a message was received from his Highness the Imam Yahya to the effect that he agreed to the suggestion of His Majesty the King and that his Highness admitted the activities and interference of his Amirs, in the matter of stirring up disturbances, amongst the Bani Malik and the Abadil. He stated that he had issued orders to prevent this and asked His Majesty to grant pardon to those who had committed these acts; and he manifested readiness to conclude the treaty and to depute a delegation. Thereupon orders were at once issued to the Amir Feisal to stop his march, but the Amir Saud had already started with a force in cars, and it was not possible for the orders to return to reach him; so he continued on his way. The Government have made certain that the attitude of his Highness the Amir Saud in that direction of the kingdom will be one ensuring tranquillity in affairs and precluding any aggression or hostility, unless the situation should necessitate it for purposes of defence, which the Government hope will not be the case, they hope also that his Highness the Imam Yahya will expedite the settlement of the matter, so that the Islamic and Arab worlds may repose in the amicable settlement of this affair. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Fuad Bey. My dear Fuad Bey, Jedda, January 23, 1934. I HAVE naturally kept my Government fully informed of our conversations regarding the situation between this country and the Yemen, including that of the 9th January when your Excellency was good enough to inform me of the latest proposals made by His Majesty the King to the Imam, the reply to which was awaited, and your telephone message of the 16th January, when you told me that the situation was unchanged, but that the Imam's reply was expected that evening or the next day. I also telegraphed to the Secretary of State a summary of the article which appeared in the Umm-al-Qura of the 16th January, and which is referred to in the following communication, which I have been instructed to make to your Excellency in the form of a personal letter. My Government learnt on the 13th January that Colonel Reilly, who as you know has been at Sana for some time, had just urged on the Imam, not for the first time, the desirability of a friendly settlement of the differences between him and His Majesty and was told that negotiations between the two rulers were progressing. This seemed to tally with what your Excellency had told me on the 9th January, even though the question of Najran still presented difficulty, and as I have stated above, you told me on the 16th January that the position was unchanged. In these circumstances. His Majesty's Government, whose only object is to promote peace and stability in Arabia, are perturbed to learn from the Umm-al-Qura that in consequence of some local disturbance His Royal Highness the heir apparent had been ordered to the front before the arrival of atelegram despatched by the Imam on the 9th January, and that the Commandet. in-chief in Asir had also been instructed to advance. Although it is stated in the Umm-al-Qura that the latter advance was countermanded on the receipt of the Imam's telegram of the 9th January, my Government cannot but fear that there is a serious danger of an outbreak of hostilities as a result of mere misunderstanding on each side as to the intentions of the other They earnestly hope that the Saudi Government, who have given so many proofs of their desire for peace, will do their utmost to avert so irreparable a misfortune. They ask me to request the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to convey this message to the King, with the assurance that it is inspired try the friendliest dispositions towards a ruler, who has constantly shown his confidence in them by asking their advice and that they are ready to continue to use their good offices to promote an amicable settlement, if the negotiations between His Majesty and the Imam are continued.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a letter which I have received from Signor Suvich in reply to my letter of the 24th January, a copy of which was transmitted to you in my despatch No. 84 of the 26th January. 2. You will observe that the Italian Government, while appreciative of the action of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, express certain apprehensions regarding the present situation and revert in effect to their proposal to hold what they apparently wish to be secret conversations in Rome. I still feel, as stated in my despatch No. 1022 of the 30th December last, that if His Majesty's Government found it possible to consent to these conversations, the efet produced here would be good. I have, &amp;c. ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure in No. 1. M. Suvich to Sir E. Drummond. (Translation.) My dear Ambassador, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Rome. I THANK your Excellency for your courteous letter of the 24th January last, in which you were so good as to send me the latest information regarding the relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam, and the step which the British Minister at Jedda, on instructions from the British Government, had taken vis-a-vis the Saudi Government with a view to stopping the advance of the Saudi troops and preventing the outbreak of hostilities. The Italian Government appreciates the action taken by the British Govern ment in this respect; and I may, in my turn, assure your Excellency that we have continued, for our part, to exert all possible influence on the Imam with the same objects of pacification which inspired the action of the Government in London. I hold that parallel action by the two Governments has indeed already contributed to diminish the tension in the relations between the two Arab kingdoms, and to induce the two Sovereigns to resume negotiations in order to arrive at an agreement. Your Excellency will in fact be aware that Ibn Saud and the Imam have decided to send their own delegations to a meeting which has been called at Abha. The head of the Saudi delegation is the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Euad Hamza. The Imam has nominated as head of the Yemeni delegation Sayid Abdalla-el-Wazir, who left Sanaa on the 29th January last, and travelled first to Saada, where he conferred for some days with the Yemeni Crown Prince, Seif-el-Islam Ahmed, and afterwards went to Abha. The conference at Abha was preceded by an exchange of wireless telegrams between Ibn Saud and the Imam as a result of which it appeared that acceptable bases had been found to enable the conference to examine and solve the following questions:— (fl) To decide the destiny of Asir and the form of its future administration^ with the consequent delimitation of the frontiers between the two Arab States. (fr) To settle the disputes regarding Nejran and the respective allegiance of its tribes. (c) To decide on the place where the Idrisi Emirs of Asir shall reside. [d) To conclude a treaty of friendship between the two countries. [56 u—2]-■Uiih. The favourable news reported above should, however, in m) opinion, be iudsred in the light of the rapid changes in the situation in the Arabian penLula A telegram dated the 11th February, 1934, from Sanaa stated that new difficulties had apparently arisen in regard to the outcome of the negotiations between Saudia and the Yemen. In fact on the 10th February a report i S said to have reached Sanaa that Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud had moved off at the head ot his army ('si era spostato con i suoi armati and was heading tor Nejran, whereas, according to the agreements which had been ailived at, military niove- ments should have been suspended, the Seif-el-Islam Ahmed remaining at Saada and Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud at Abha. , . n „ In these circumstances, while for our part we continue to follow with all attention the development of events and to influence the Imam in a sense favour able to a solution of the existing differences, we maintain an attitude of reserve in regard to the merits of such differences in conformity with the conclusions and the spirit of the conversations of Rome 1927. .fl In the last paragraph of your letter of the 24th January, your Excellency set forth the motives which led the British Government to think that the moment was undesirable to proceed with the conversations proposed b) the Italian Government. Vour Excellency stated, ititw o^lia, that one of the principal reasons which induced the Eoreign Office to assume this attitude was that the points of view of the Italian and British Governments in regard to Asir and in regard to the rights of the Imam over that region were completely divergent. I think it useful to observe in this connexion that in accordance with the statements contained in paragraph 2 of the note verhale of the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 23rd December last, the Italian Government, conforming to the spirit of the conclusions of the conversations of Rome, holds that no particular attitude should be adopted (' di non dovere comunque assumere posizione ') in regard to the differences which separate the two Arab States, and hence in regard to the question of Asir which is the principal bone of contention between them. It does not seem, therefore, possible to assert that the points of view of the Italian and British Governments in this connexion are divergent since the Italian Government, I repeat, holds that no particular attitude should be adopted. With regard to the attitude adopted by His Britannic Majesty's Government, the Italian Government has already had occasion in the above-mentioned note verhcde, to draw attention to the fact that the representatives of the British Government, during the conversations of Rome, declared that all territorial questions in regard to Asir and in general concerning the frontiers between the Hejaz and the Yemen were regarded as an internal Arabian question, which did not interest the British Government. In the same note verhale was expressed the confidence that His Britannic Majesty's Government would maintain their determination to avoid all formal and direct recognition of the sovereignty of Ibn baud over Asir, and would also abstain from adopting any particular position in regard to the differences between the two Arabian States.' lurther, the Anglo-Italian conversations proposed by the Italian Government were designed to have the same confidential character, as the conversations of Rome of 1927, and since they would not become known in Arabia they could not influence the course of the negotiations at present being conducted between the two Arabian States. They would thus serve a useful purpose in defining the points of view of the Italian and British Governments, who have always co-opei ated in a friendly spirit for the maintenance of peace in the Arabian peninsula.

(No. 79.) itndeoii gj r) Jedda, March 25, 1934. win ' jjq- -^y telegrams Nos. 45 and 46 of the 24th March, I have reported the main points in my conversation with Sheikh Ynsuf Yasin that morning regarding the !i Saudi-Yemen situation. I now enclose a fairly full record of what passed. The 1 discussion covered the ground so completely that I do not think it necessary to i send you any further account of the less interesting conversation I had with a Taufiq Bey Hamza on the 22nd March, when he brought me the message reported lewast! in my telegram No. 42 of the 23rd March. to Mi 2. The denouement, which has been so long expected, has taken a rather dmrp: unexpected shape. When I received the first intimation that Ibn Saud had ordered 'dance his troops to advance, I was in some doubt as to whether his apparent desire to falii localise any armed conflict was due to unwillingness to commit himself too ent,^ irretrievably to a war which may be disastrous for him, or to unwillingness to let loM the full importance of the crisis be publicly realised until after the pilgrimage, mpf 3. The King might well shrink from war, if he could avoid it without jabm crushing humiliation. Only a couple of days ago his Director-General of Military leofii Organisation told a member of my staff that the Saudi Government knew all ittlffi about the Yemeni army. The Imam, he said, could put 12,000 regulars into the - nl field at once and could produce another 13,000 regulars and 50,000 irregulars m due course. The Director-General added that, in his opinion, Ibn baud could smash the Imamic army within two months; but, if there be anything m these i'sGo® figures, one cannot think that Ibn Saud likes the prospect of tackling 75,000 men -' : - i of any quality with the troops he has mobilised. 4 My conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, however, seems to show tha i n -11, ,1 • 1, T TTwn iTtrill fhink T WMlf, tnO tar ji r the King has decided to take every risk.

SHEIKH YUSUF YASIN came to see me this morning. ^ the main points in a conversation which lasted over two horns. , . ■ or J er always that of the actual discussion, as we came back on cer a J inpidputallv to elucidate them. I have omitted many points which were touched on incidentally only or are unimportant. [81 q-2]2. The King, said Sheikh Yusaf, was desirous of peace. There had been many occasions in the past when he might have gone to war with the Imam, but he had always avoided it. He had no territorial ambitions in respect of the Yemen. His dominions were quite large enough. The failure of the Abha Conference and of his direct negotiations with the Imam compelled him to defend his rights. It was hardly necessary to go into the reasons for his friendship with His Majesty's Government. He wished to keep them informed as a duty of friendship and in order to seek their advice. He was confident that His Majesty 's Government were on his side. 3. Sheikh Yusuf went on to say that he was not sure how much I had been told by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Taufiq Bey Hamza. He would, therefore recapitulate the developments which had produced the present situation. I would remember that at an earlier stage the King and the Imam had reached a preliminary agreement regarding the determination of frontiers, the disposal of the Idrisi, the discussion of the Najran question and a meeting of delegates to draw up a treaty of friendship. The King had thereupon ordered his troops to keep to their positions and to make no advance. Even before that the Commander- in-chief had been directed to refrain from any aggression. 4. Before the delegates met the Imam had taken forward action. He had sent Abdul Wahhab-el-Idrisi to occupy A1 Ardha, where a Saudi garrison of fifty men were made prisoners. He had made approaches to the Beni Malik, some of whom took his part, and to the people of Faifa, who resisted. He had occupied both districts, sent olncials there and collected taxes. The Imam had stated, in reply to remonstrances, that these acts were done before his orders had reached his commanders, and had promised to evacuate the occupied areas, subject to the King s pardoning the local dissidents. The King had done this, but there had been no withdrawal. On the contrary the Yemeni forces in the Beni Malik area had been reinforced. 5. Sheikh Yusuf was quite vague as regards dates, and his information as t ? ^ti ibution of tribes differed somewhat from that given me bv ua ey Hamza. I gathered, however, that the area affected comprised the two moun ains called Beni Malik and Faifa, and the tribes bearing those names as we as 0 eis like the Abadil and Bil-Ghazi, A1 Ardha being apparently in the V. ,U n 0 • 0 A ^ acllL .(The fact is that neither Fuad Bey nor Sheikh Yusuf have ^c£ re f C1 /? e 111 01ma Jj 011 ' ^ ma y be taken that the most salient features of tne disputed area are the two mountains named.) tainp!i w k en . th® delegates met was that the occupation was main- to ask thp Kincff 1€ | 0ni !f €s ? lven by the Imam.

After thanking Shefkh Yu nf ^ e i lad ? far beei1 no clash - • f confidence that His Majesty's Government wpvJ ^ th ! Ki ^ ,s ^ vessl jj j . vjuvernment were on his side. They were, indeed,animated by the friendliest dispositions toward him, but they had never passed a judgment the elements for which were lacking. The quarrel related to three areas. Firstly, there was the littoral of Asir, where the position was pretty clear, i.e., the King held it and the Imam had asserted a claim to it without having attempted to enforce his claim. Secondly, there was the mountain area, which fell to be subdivided into two parts, as part of it had belonged to the former Idrisi territory, which the King claimed in virtue of a cession by its previous ruler, while part of it belonged to what was called Asir Surat, where the King's claims rested on some different basis. Thirdly, there was Najran. 9. I said that the message sent to me'by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 22nd March had suggested to my own mind two questions, one of which I could not put to a subordinate secretary, though I had asked him the other. They were these: (1) If the objective were the recovery of territory which the King considered to be his, why should it be contemplated as necessary to cross into territory which was admittedly the Imam's? (2) Was it certain that the acts complained of were those of the Imam and not merely those of Abdul Wahhab, the most strenuous member of the'family which had ruled Asir ? 10. Sheikh Yusuf took the second question first. He said there was no doubt whatsoever that the Imam had sent his forces, had installed his officials and had collected taxes.. 11. In reply to my first question. Sheikh Yusuf said that he had no knowledge of military affairs. It might be necessary to enter Yemeni territory to get the best access to the areas to be recovered. 12. This, I said, did not quite agree with the Amir Feisal's message. He had spoken of an advance to the frontier and to the possible necessity for crossing it, when it had been reached. I urged that any invasion of the Imam's territory would mean war. Sheikh Yusuf asked whether the Imam had not been guilty of aggression, when he entered Saudi territory. I said that, if the King were sure of his title he could no doubt have regarded this as casus belli. He had prudently preferred not to do so because it did not suit him. If he entered the Imam's territory he would be putting the Imam in a position to treat his action as hostile and to declare that he had provoked war. This might not suit him either. The position to-day as I saw it was that no formal state of war existed. The position would be very different if, in the immediate future, there were a definite war, the outcome of which no one could foresee. It was generally thought that the King intended to produce this state of affairs immediately after the impending festival, and Sheikh Yusuf himself had just used the phrase, 'when the war begins.' 13. To reinforce my argument that the King should not precipitate a definite state of war by invading the Imam's territory, I reminded Sheikh Yusuf that the King was a party to a pact, the Kellogg Pact, the renunciation clause of which did not apply to the present case, but which condemned war. The King would have a position to defend not only militarily but politically. 14. I made it clear throughout that I was speaking merely for myself. Indeed, I observed, I was saying much more than my Government would ever say probably. I was not criticising the King. I was thinking of two interests, that of the King and that of peace. 15. The following further points of some importance came out during the conversation :— [a) Sheikh Yusuf said that the King was on perfectly sound ground as regards Jebel Beni Malik and Jebel Faifa, which had been expressly mentioned at the time of the Arwa settlement, I said this was new to me. Sheikh Yusuf said that, when the Imam accepted the King's award, the Imam had expressed disappointment at not getting more, but had said that he would abide by the award and had instructed his delegates not to pursue the question of the Jebels Malik ana Faifa. This had always been taken to mean that he agreed to their being regarded as Saudi. t ^ (5) When Sheikh Yusuf referred to a Saudi withdrawal from Najran, I said we had understood that there were no Saudi forces in that aiea. Sheikh Yusuf said that there had been forces from Wadi Duwasir at the northern extremity of the valley. When the Yemeni forces got to Habuna and saw Saudi forces in the neighbourhood, the Yemenis retired.(c) Sheikh Yusuf said that it had been decided to publish the ' Green Book' previously inentioned. It would contain all the documents and show clearly that the King's aetion was justified. id) Sheikh Yusuf thought it unlikely that the King would go to the front. There hcicl been some ides thcit he might, but he hcicl no prGS6iit intention of doing so. ANDREW RYAN.

Drummond {Rome). (No. 318.) Sir, Foreign Office, April 5, 1934. I HAVE had under consideration your Excellency's despatch No. 241 of the 17th March, but I remain of the opinion that it would be inexpedient to accede to the proposal of the Italian Government, that a conference of British and Italian experts should be held to discuss the situation in South-Western Arabia. 2. It is true that the developments which have taken place there since my despatch No. 39 of the 15th January was written make it appear less likely that King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen will reach a solution of their differences without recourse to hostilities; but there appear to be no new joint steps to promote a peaceful settlement of the dispute, which His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government could agree, as a result of such a conference, to take. They can only continue, as in the past, to urge moderation upon both Sovereigns, should further opportunity arise. Meanwhile, so long as the Italian Government maintain their present attitude upon the questions of King Ibn Baud's rights over Asir and of the Imam's alleged claims in respect of that territory, no conference can lead to agreement upon these points. Moreover, discussion of them, if hostilities do in fact break out, would be academic. It might even lead to the disappearance of the existing measure of agreement in regard to the attitude to be adopted by the two Governments in case of a Saudi- Yemeni conflict, as recorded in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927. 3. Since, however, the Italian Government continue to reiterate their thesis that the question of the sovereignty of Asir remains open, and to imply, as is done in the seventh and eighth paragraphs of Signor Suvich's letter to you, a translation of which was enclosed in your despatch, that in regarding Asir as now rightfully a part of King Ibn Saud's dominions. His Majesty's Government are acting at variance with the spirit of the Rome conversations of 1927 and the declarations of the British representatives during those meetings. His Majesty's Government cannot, merely in order to avoid controversy, refrain any longer from making the grounds of their attitude clear without a risk that the Italian Government may doubt their good faith. 4. I request, therefore, that, in replying to Signor Suvich's letter, you will, using the material in paragraphs 3-7 of my despatch No. 39, explain to him the reasons for the considered view of His Majesty's Government that in inter national law the sovereignty over the territory ruled by the Idrisi has undoubtedly passed to King Ibn Saud (and that it therefore cannot be considered an open question), and endeavour to clear up the misunderstanding regarding the undertaking of His Majesty's Government to refrain from addressing to the Government of King Ibn Saud a formal communication of their recognition of his sovereignty over Asir. It may be well to add in your reply that His Majesty s Government will naturally continue, in pursuance of the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, not only to refrain from intervention in the present conflict between King Ibn Saud and the Imam, but also to avoid all appearance of taking the part of either of the disputants, while seeking, should further opportunities arise, to use their influence in favour of a peaceful settlement. You may also assure Signor Suvich of my desire to continue to exchange information with the Italian Government regarding the progress of the dispute. You should give him no encouragement to hope that His Majesty's Government will accept the invitation to hold a conference of experts, so long at any rate as the Italian Government maintain their view regarding the status of Asir; but you may inform him that, should he desire further explanation in regard to any special point concerning the policy of His Majesty's Government in Arabian affairs, I shall of course be happy to give it to him when he visits London at the end of the month. 5.

Sir, JcddcL J^lQjTch 31 ^934 WITH reference to my despatch No. 79 of the 25th March, I have the honour to state that since that date I have received no further information of any value regarding the Saudi-\emen situation. Rumours of fighting and of Saudi reverses have reached me from Mecca, and my Indian vice-consul reports the existence of much apprehension there. He also reports that the King goes in fear of his life, in consequence of a message that a party has set out from Sana to assassinate him. He relates with circumstantial detail the precautions that were taken before and after the pilgrimage to ensure His Majesty's safety. 2. In my telegram No. 45 of the 24th March I referred to the speech which the King was understood to have made on the 22nd March at his annual dinner to notable pilgrims. This speech was reported in the Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd March, but the number was unobtainable in Jedda for several days. It was perhaps deliberately kept back until the pilgrimage should be safely over. When received, it was found to contain the King's speech, a leading article on the situation, and a communique. The leading article followed closely the general lines of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's statement to me on the 24th March, but was not so precise. The communique contained little more than an announce ment that the King, having achieved nothing by his patience and his negotiations, had ordered the heir apparent to advance to the frontier, with a view to the recovery of the territory invaded by the Imam. I need not trouble you with translations of these documents. I need only note that they do not reproduce Sheikh Yusuf's statement to me that the Imam had made the evacuation of the occupied territory conditional on the renunciation of Najran by Ibn Saud; and they do not explicitly foreshadow a crossing of the frontier, though the note struck in the leading article is a note of war, unless the Imam uses the door to peace which the King has left open, by honouring his previous engagements. 3. The King's speech is fairly hot stuff, but this also reiterates so much that is familiar that a full translation would be wearisome. It begins with the complaint that the King has been done down by the Imam, a man whom he had regarded as his dearest friend. This is followed by a justification of his proceedings in Asir, where he had spent from 200,000 to 250,000 riyals a year, over and above its revenue, after the Idrisi had asked him to take charge. He goes on to accuse the Imam of breaking the agreement reached in December 1931, inter alia by not extraditing the Idrisi after his flight into the Yemen a year later. This leads up to a relation of more recent events, which is chiefly interesting because of certain incidental passages. In one of these the King gives as his reason for patience (apart from the question of expense) the fact that the Imam was negotiating with His Majesty's Government regarding the nine cantons, and he was unwilling to do anything that might be misinterpreted. In another, he claims that the people of Najran have paid taxes to the A1 Saud since the time of his ancestors, in virtue of letters and treaties still in existence; and he scoffs at the idea that a Yemeni tribal origin can justify the Imam in claiming them as subjects, any more than he himself could claim his cousin jbn Shalan, or the Imam could claim the many people of Yemeni origin in Syria. In a third passage the King comments bitterly on the fact that none of the Moslem rulers, representatives or parties have sought to effect a reconciliation and to S1 it the true from the false, but have merely sent useless expressions of their hopes a na good wishes. [81 aa—2]2 4. The Umm-al-Qura of the 30th March contains a further communique, which I enclose in translation^ 1 ) as it is the most recent pronouncement available, and shows that even now Ibn Saud is anxious to present no appearance of seeking war. You will observe that it formally asserts that there has been no fighting so far, despite the rumours referred to in the first paragraph of this despatch. G 5.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 318 of the 5th April, I handed Signer Suvich to-day a letter of which a copy is enclosed, embodying the substance of the statement you instructed me to make to the Italian Government. I laid emphasis on the point that Signor Suvich would be able to obtain any additional information he desired during his forthcoming visit to London. 2. Signor Suvich stated that he could not regard the present hostilities very seriously. No doubt we should hear for some time to come of important victories on each side. At any rate the Italian Government were continuing to act in the spirit of the Rome conversations of 1927 and had yesterday sent a message to the Imam urging moderation and a settlement. 3. As regards the Asir question, the Italian view was and continued to be that it was desirable that Asir should be a small, and more or less independent, buffer State. I said to him that the reasons for which His Majesty's Government were unable to accept such a position were set out in the letter I had just handed to him, but I felt that the advice given by the Italian Government to the Imam would be much appreciated by my Government. I have, &amp;c. ERIC DRUMMOND. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir E. Drummond to Signor Suvich. My dear Minister, April 19, 1934. I DID not fail to transmit to my Government your letter received in tne Embassy on the 9th March, regarding the situation in South-West Arabia, ana I have now received their comments. Briefly, these are to the effect that His Majesty's Government, though anxious as always to meet the wishes of the Italian Government, are unable to share their views as to the desirability of a conierence between British and Italian experts at the present time. If we may believe the rather confused reports of the last fortnight, nostili les between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen have already broken out on a considerable scale. In the circumstances it would almost certainly be use ess to hold a conference, the major object of which was to consider ways and means of arriving at a peaceful settlement of the dispute. There appear, thereiore, to be no new joint steps which the two Governments could, as a result o sue a conference, usefully take. They can only continue, as in the past ana m accordance with paragraph 2 of the Rome conversations oi 19 7, o urge moderation upon both sovereigns, should further opportunity arise. Moreover, your letter under reference appeared to suggest that the Italian Government still considered the question of the sovereignty of Asir as open, ana implied that, in regarding Asir as a rightful part of King Ibn Saud s dominions, His Majesty's Government were acting at variance with the spirit o e ome conversations of 1927 and the declarations of the British representatives during those meetings. Since His Majesty's Government desire to act m complete frankness. I have now been instructed to explain to you in detail the reasons tor their considered view that, quite apart from the outcome of the present hostih i , m international law the sovereignty over the territory ruled by the Idnsi lias undoubtedly passed to King Ibn Saud (and cannot, therefore, be considered as an open question) and, at the same time, to endeavour to clear up the misunder standing regarding the undertaking of His Majesty's Government to retrain [81 cc—3]2 from addressing to King Ibn Saud a formal communication of their recognition of his sovereignty over Asir. The position in international law appears to His Majesty's Government to be as follows :— Prior to the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca of 1926, the Idrisi was an independent ruler exercising sovereignty over certain territories in South-West Arabia. By the Treaty of Mecca, the Idrisi handed over to King Ibn Saud the entire control over his foreign relations, while retaining the government of the internal affairs of his country, apart from financial matters, which were also handed over to Ibn Saud. The result of the Treaty of Mecca was to establish a protectorate by Ibn Saud over the territories of the Idrisi as they existed at that date, and the Idrisi became unable, owing to the fact that he no longer possessed the control of foreign affairs, to alienate to any other Power any of his territories. As a result of the treaty of 1926 the Idrisi ceased to possess the status of an independent person under international law. In 1930, as the result of negotiations which culminated in letters of the 10th October from the Idrisi and from his Council to King Ibn Saud, and as 1 further defined in an arrangement contained in a report signed on the 16th November by representatives of King Ibn Saud and of the Idrisi, the Idrisi handed over to King Ibn Saud the internal government of his territory; and these arrangements were put into force by an order issued by King Ibn Saud on the 20th November, 1930, under which the Idrisi territory was governed by a direct representative, appointed by King Ibn Saud under the title of Emir, assisted by an elected legislative council, the Idrisi merely retaining the nominal position of head of the Idrisi territory under Ibn Saud, with some powers of veto over the decisions of the Emir and the Legislative Council, subject to the final decision of King Ibn Saud. It appears to be perfectly clear that, as the result of the arrange ments made in 1930, King Ibn Saud acquired full and complete sovereignty over the territories of the Idrisi, and that the form of government set up therein became merely part of the internal constitution of the territories of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies as it was then called. The territories over which King Ibn Saud thus acquired sovereignty were the same territories as those over which he had acquired a protectorate under the Ireaty of Mecca of 1926, namely, all the territories which were under the sovereignty of the Idrisi, at the moment of the conclusion of the Treaty of Mecca, is appeared to His Majesty's Government at the time—and still appears to ^been the position at that date. They considered further that King ^ vi s / overei g llt y over these territories was effective in international law and did not require any express or implied recognition by any other Power to render it legally complete and effective. It was on these grounds that His Majesty's Government (when the question f if 1 m l 'A f r H CUS v OI 'i W n 1 the Italian Government in 1931 as a result of a request * e ^ az t, 0 !

Sir, Jedda, April 4, 1934. WITHIN twenty-four hours of drafting my despatch No. 88 of the 31st March, regarding the Saudi-Yemen situation, I received an intimation that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had been appointed Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. I gave you in my telegram No. 49 of the 2nd April the main points of our conversation when he paid me his first visit in his new capacity that morning. 2. I made very rough notes of the ten telegrams exchanged between the two rulers, following on telegrams from the King to the Imam announcing that he had ordered the heir apparent to advance. Although I am keeping a record of them here, I think it unnecessary to burden you with the details of this wordy correspondence. Its chief characteristic is the unrelenting firmness of the King in stating and restating his demands and refusing to be put off by any suggestion that he should stay his hand without obtaining complete satisfaction. 3. As for the demands themselves, there is little to add to the summary in my telegram No. 49 of the 2nd April, except that the King made a special point of the release of the hostages taken by the Imam in the Faifa-Beni Malik area. The King bases himself expressly on the agreement, which he says was come to by his delegates at Sana in 1927-28, and on the agreement of the 31st December regarding Arwa. He claims that by the former the Imam agreed to leave to him everything north of Waila, but offers for the sake of peace to agree to a neutralisation or partition of the Wadi Najran proper, as distinct from the area Badr-Hadada-Habuna, which he describes as being occupied by the Ikhwan. He repudiates a suggestion, apparently made by the Imam, that the Yemeni invasion of Najran was justified by correspondence subsequent to the Arwa settlement. 4. The statement that the Badr—Hadada—Habuna area is now held by Ibn Saud was new to me. I do not think I had previously heard of Hadada, which appears to be east of Badr. Sheikh Yusuf could not explain what had happened in this area. I surmise that the Ikhwan have held it since December, when it was admitted that certain of the King's sympathisers had joined forces with the local tribesmen, but denied that they were organised Saudi troops. 5. The King's telegrams emphasise and confirm his previous promise ot pardon to the rebels in the Faifa-Beni Malik area. , t _ 6. In one of the earlier telegrams the Imam begged the King to beware ot opening the door for foreign intrigue. The King, in his reply, said that he was alive to this danger, and took credit for having held his hand when he learned that the Imam was engaged in negotiations with His Majesty s (joveinmen . When reading these passages. Sheikh Irusuf said that the King had specia \ charged him to explain the references to the Anglo-Yemen negotiations m is speech of the 22nd March and in his correspondence with the Imam. I hey mean that he had wished at the time to avoid any appearance of putting pressure on the Imam not to conclude an agreement with His Majesty s Government. 7. In my comments at the end of the conversation I expressed gratihcation at the King's explanation, saying that I had noticed the expression toreign intrigue.' I developed in some detail the thesis that, whether people liKe( oi disliked the policy of His Majesty's Government, it was open and above board.. Since the Great War they had sought to cultivate friendship with all Arab rulei h in their respective spheres and to promote friendship among them. Iheir poiic\ was entirely free from intrigue. I recalled once more the en cumstances m w iic the British mission had been sent to Sana. . , . „ •, i + 8. When urging that it might be prudent to avoid, if possible any entry into admittedlv Yemeni territory, I made it clear that 1 was not speaking m le- interest of the'Imam, but in that of Ibn Saud. I had heard, I said, not from a [81 aa—3] EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL.^ [E 2835/79/25]Yemeni but from a Saudi source that the Imam could put some 80,000 men in the field. If that were so, could the King tackle them ? It had suited him not to treat the Imam's invasion of what he claimed as his territory as a casus belli. Would it suit him now to become involved in an open and declared war, which would be the greatest in Arabia since the Turks were driven out ? Sheikh Yusuf insisted that the Imam's aggression must be met, and intimated that the Saudi Government feared a Yemeni attack on Sabya and Jizan. I admitted that this would produce a new situation. 9. I asked whether the King's reference in his speech to the failure of Moslem rulers, &amp;c., to prompt reconciliation did not ignore the offer made some time ago by King Feisal. I was not, I explained, suggesting that King Feisal would have been the ideal mediator, but the offer had been made. Sheikh Yusuf first referred to telegrams received, after the King had ordered the heir apparent to advance, from the Chief Mufti of Palestine, King Ghazi, Prince Omar Toussoun, and at least one other. He intimated that, in the case of King Feisal, the Saudi Government had suspected some understanding between the King of Iraq and the Imam. They supposed that those who had approached the King had also approached the Imam, but they did not know what had passed. They themselves had neither sought nor rejected mediation, whether by King Feisal or anyone else. Sheikh Yusuf referred, when speaking of potential mediators, to the Moslem Conference of Jerusalem, a topic which I preferred not to pursue. In any case, Sheikh Yusuf clearly thought that the time for mediation had gone by. And, of course, it has, for the time being. 10. A rumour got about some little time ago that the King was detaining the Yemeni delegation at Abha. It was doubtless with reference to this that the King in his last telegram told the Imam that Abdullah-al-Wazir could do as he pleased; return to his master, stay at Abha or come to Mecca as an honoured guest. A more explicit denial of the detention rumour appeared in Saut-al-Hijaz of the 2nd April. The same paper announced that the King, not from necessity, but in deference to the patriotic wish of the people of the Hejaz and Nejd to take part in the war, had ordered the Emirs Feisal and Muhammad to take command of the forces from the Tihama and the reserves in Nejd respectively. The war is described in this paper as Jihad. 11. Mr. Philby came to see me on the 3rd April. He regards war to the knife as a foregone conclusion. He outlined a probable Saudi plan of campaign, which he has sent to the Times. Broadly speaking, he contemplates two main Saudi advances, east and west of the central ridge of mountains running from north to south between Tihamat Asir and Najran. The object of the eastern advance would be to cut communications with Najran and the mountains and to occupy Saada. The western advance would be aimed at Medi and Haradh. Mr. Philby talks merrily of the ease with which these movements would lead on to Sana and as far south as any desired point on the coast, e.g., Hudeyda. He believes fervently in the success of Ibn Saud, and describes his imagined operations as though it were a question of a military promenade. He describes Baqim, or Baghim, which Sheikh Yusuf mentioned confidentially as the heir apparent s first objective, as being definitelv in the Yemen.

CONFIDENTIAL. /\ May 9, 1934. S ection 1. [E 2923/79/25] No. 1. Sir John Simon to M. Grandi. Your Excellency, Foreign Office, May 9, 1934. ON the 7th May a member of your staff called at the Foreign Office and made a communication from the Italian Government regarding the conflict which has unfortunately broken out between King Ibn Sand of Saudi Arabia and the Imam Yahia of the Yemen. This communication began by stating that the Italian Government learnt that the Imam had invited the mediation of friendly States by a telegram dated the 2nd May, addressed to Rome, London, Moscow, Bagdad and The Hague. The Italian Government were anxious to know whether His Majesty's Government contemplated any approach to the two belligerents as a result of this telegram, and, if so, the Italian Government, fearing lest the situation should further deteriorate, wished to make it clear that they would be disposed to take similar action, with a view to furthering a peaceful settlement, in agreement with the British Government. In making this communication the Italian Government were inspired by the spirit of the conclusions of the Rome Conversations of 1927. 2. I now have the honour to inform your Excellency in reply to this communication that His Majesty's Government fully share the desire of the Italian Government to do all in their power to help bring about a peaceful settlement of the present dispute. They have, indeed, ever since the dispute first showed signs of becoming acute, lost no opportunity to urge counsels of moderation on King Ibn Saud, and they think that King Ibn Sand was influenced by this advice in making the repeated efforts which he undoubtedly did to reach a peaceful settlement with the Imam and in postponing an actual outbreak of hostilities for so long. As the Italian Government are aware. His Majesty's Government also took the opportunity of the recent visit to Sanaa by the Resident at Aden to urge similar counsels of moderation on the Imam. 3. Unfortunately, however, these counsels of moderation did not suffice to avert a rupture; and His Majesty's Government cannot but feel that, in view of this experience and of the present situation consequent upon the actual outbreak of hostilities, the conditions which might make any effort at mediation useful do not at present exist. In these circumstances, while they will continue to watch for any favourable opportunity to do whatever may lie in their power to further the cause of the re-establishment of peace, they feel that nothing would be gained by any attempt at mediation at the present stage.

Rome, May 4, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Note verbale. (Translation.) IN their note verbale of the 30th April, replying to the request of the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs for immediate British intervention with the Govern ment of Jedda with a view to procuring the suspension of hostilities by King Ibn Saud, His Britannic Majesty's Embassy stated after recalling various other recent occasions on which British influence had been exercised at Jedda —that the Government of London feared that ' where the rights and wrongs of the position are as obscure as they are at the present moment, intervention at this stage might well do more harm than good.' In regard to the above, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to make the following observations, viz., that apart from the discussions as to the rights and wrongs, the situation is clear in this respect, that the Imam has declared his acceptance of all the conditions imposed by Ibn S a uu. for desisting from armed action, and that in spite of this the advance of baudi troops into Yemeni territory continues and the tribes of the Yemeni-Tihama are stirred up against the Imam. The result of this has been that Hodeida as recently been evacuated by the Yemeni troops. We are thus face to lace wit events which may upset the existing political equilibrium on the eastern coas of the Red Sea, which was the subject of the Rome conversations ot Wli between Italy and Great Britain. If events are allowed to take their course without interference, the interests w T hich these conversations were designe o protect may be compromised. The Royal Government for their par canno therefore but regard with anxiety the creation of a fresh situation dis mc -o that which was the basis of the Italo-British agreements embo ie in protocol of the Rome conversations of 1927. It was in the light o sue ^ siderations that the Royal Government considered it desirable and urgent thac the work of persuasion vis-a-vis the Government of Ibn Sau s iou jj 0 , interrupted, but rather intensified (the Italian Government for their pait l a \e not failed to act in this sense vis-d-vis the Imam) m order that notnuig nngnb be neglected which might prevent the situation in the Arabian penmsu c becoming more serious. „ , , i . tj -^ A/To^afv'^ The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs are confident that Hls Embassy will appreciate the friendly spirit of the present commumc y ' +-j on is inspired by the desire to eontinue the cordial I^'o -British oollaboration established in 1927, with the object of preserving peace m the Arabia p and of safeguarding the important interests possessed y a y c Britain on the eastern coast of the Red Sea.

Ttome, May 2, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Note verhale. HIS Majesty's Embassy present their compliments to the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and have the honour to inform them that they did not fail to communicate to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom the substance of the Royal Ministry's note verhale of the 25th April on the subject of the present situation in South-Western Arabia. As the Royal Italian Government will be aware. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have, throughout the course of the present dispute between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of Yemen, constantly urged on King Ibn Saud the extreme desirability of arriving at a peaceful settlement of the questions at issue. In particular, when, at the beginning of the present year, an outbreak of hostilities unfortunately appeared imminent, His Majesty s Minister at Jedda was instructed on the 23rd January to address to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs the personal letter, the substance of which was communicated to the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs in His Majesty s Ambassador's personal letter of the 24th January to his Excellency the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Similarly, on the 22nd March, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda made to a representative of the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs a personal communication, the tenor of which was subsequently approved by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, expressing the earnest hope that it would be possible to avoid the crossing of the frontier by Saudi troops: the substance of this communication was given in the note verbale from this Embassy No. 99 of the 29th March. While His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will, m the future as on these and other occasions in the past, be most ready to use their influence with King Ibn Saud whenever it appears to them that by so they are likely to contribute to the cause of peace, they fear that where the rights and wrongs of the position are as obscure as they are at the p i esen moment, intervention by them at this stage might well do more harm tnan good. His Majesty's Government will, however, certainly exert their mnuence on behalf of peace as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs. Rome, April 30, 1934.

SINCE writing my despatch No. 91 of the 4th April, I have sent you several telegrams on the Saudi-Yemen situation, ending with my telegram No. 60 of the 12th April, as well as the two communiques enclosed in my printed despatches No. 101 of the 9th April and No. 102 of the 11th April. There is little of real importance to add to these reports, as regards the main course of events, but, as the King has been in Jedda and is leaving to-day, I find this a convenient moment to record a few matters of subsidiary interest. 2. The King arrived in Jedda early on the 11th April, in accordance with his usual practice of visiting this town soon after the pilgrimage. I was received in formal audience that morning, accompanied by Mr. Furlonge, and again this morning, when I presented the Commissioner of Port Sudan, now here on a visit. We all gained the impression that His Majesty was in good form. He seemed somewhat tired and worn, but exhibited no signs of nervousness or discomposure. We discussed general subjects only, as etiquette requires. For all His Majesty showed, there might have been no war on nearer than Paraguay. He has left all business to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin during this stay and I need not record his visit to Jedda otherwise, except in the Jedda report. 3. The statement in the last paragraph of my telegram No. 52 of the 6tli April that the Amirs Feisal and Muhammad had started for the front was based on the communique issued that day, but was erroneous as regards the Amir Feisal. I learnt afterwards that, as his troops were mounted on camels, he preferred to delay his own departure and catch them up later. So far as I know, he had not set forth up to yesterday. i a -i 4. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, whom I have seen daily since the 10th Apnl, discussed the situation with me that evening and again on the 12th April. He added little, as regards the actual operations in the south, to the communiques, except that he spoke of a movement of submission to the Ibn baud among the tribes along the littoral. I think that he was referring to tribes on both sides of the de facto frontier, and at one moment spoke of the tribes as fai as Luhayya having submitted, or being ready to submit, but he was rather muddled when I reverted to the subject on the 12th April. . 5. You will have heard of the abundant talk of mediation m Egypt and elsewhere. The most important move in this direction so far seems to be tia of a group including Haj Amin Husseini of Jerusalem, Abdul Hamid Bey baid, the Egyptian politician, Hashim Bey Attas of Syria and, it would appear from General Wauchope's telegram No. 60 to me (repeated to the Colonial Office), an Iraqi element of which I have not heard otherwise. I am no c ear as o how far Prince Omar Toussoun is connected with this group or as to the attitude of the King of Iraq. I gather that the plan is to se ' d . a ™ SS10 'J; 0 visit both Ibn Saud and the Imam in the hope of composing their differences. 6. Judging by the language of Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and other indications I think that Ibn Saud's present attitude towards all outside peace movers is one of polite aloofness. If a mixed Arab mission should vis't bmiarid bjibasiio sustained any serious reverse in the interval, I anticipate that h's epb ™ 1 such as may be summed up in the words : ' That wicked man ha-s foreed me across the Rubicon. I have told him my present terms. And there is no m g T 6 Thf public of Jedda show very little interest in the war^w ^ ^ 1 ^n ascertain. I hear of no important repercussions m Mecca Any %alty may be felt towards Ibn Saud in these towns is well M'taine - Eumou readier to locate the Imam's forces a few hours march from Riyadh or at Jizan than to echo the official news of victories over the border. [106 o—l]u. There is, of course, a great deal in the two local papers. Most of it y apart from communiques, is not worth recording, but one passage in the UTfiM-al-Qura of the 6th April is at least faintly amusing. An aiticle headed ' Poor News ' refers first to the Times leader of the 24th March. It is not, however, directed, as might appear at first sight, against that sympathetic journal, but against commentators who have ti led to make out that the 4,000 hostages mentioned by the Times are at Riyadh, not at Sana. The Umm-al-Qura assures its readers that the number of hostages sent to Sana is not less than 30,000, not merely 4,000, as stated m the Times; and adds that there is nothing of the kind at Riyadh. . 9. The press also announces the formation of a First-Aid Association for the benefit of the fighting forces, under the presidency of Muhammad-ash-Shaibi, the Keeper of the Key of the Kaaba. The objects of the association are apparently to collect funds from the people to supply first-aid requirements, which have not hitherto been considered necessary adjuncts to warfare in this country. Its subscription list has been opened by the head of the long-established merchant family of Keynal and that of the A1 Fadhi family, who put down £200 and £100 gold respectively. Nothing has yet been said as to how the monies collected will be spent. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to Rome and Aden. I have, &amp;c.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 14.) (No. 115.) Sir, Jedda, April 19, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 104 of the 13th April, I have the honour U) submit a further report on the Saudi-Yemen situation. It must be even more meagre than usual, as I haye had no personal contact with the Saudi Government since that date. They may be too busy; they may have too little to tell to make it worth telling; or they may be holding off me owing to the imbroglio over the iioyal slave, who took refuge in the Legation on the 11th April and who is still undisposed of. 2. I enclose a translation of ^ communique issued in the Umm-al-Qura of the l^th April. It merely confirmed what Sheikh Yussuf Yasin had told me the previous day, as recorded in my telegram No. 60 of the 12th April. You will observe that the Saudi Government give in their communique the text of the Imam's telegram to the King, one phrase in -vvhich is completely obscure (that relating to the Yam territory); but give an account only of the King's reply. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin had followed the same procedure in his conversation with me. The account he gave me of the King's telegram was similar to that in the communique, except in one particular, which I have not thought it worth while to telegraph. The sheikh mentioned the 'release of hostages' as one of the King's conditions. The communique refers more explicitly to hostages taken in the mountains, i.e., the Faifa-Beni Malik area, and adds that the King demanded that the Imam should cease to concern himself with the people in that area. 3. No further war news has appeared in the press, except a short announce ment in the Saut-ul-Hijaz of the 16th April, a translation of which I also enclose^ 1 ) The most definite statement in it is that the last of the forts at Haradh has fallen. Mr. Philby, who gave me the same news said that the Yemeni officer commanding had escaped. He stated that the position at Baqim was unchanged, but that the Saudis attached importance to the occupation of Bab-al-Hadid (see the enclosure in my printed despatch No. 102 of the 11th April), as it commanded the approach to the disputed mountain area. 4. I still have no confirmation of Mr. Philby's further statement (see my telegram No. 62 of the 16th April) that the King received on the 14th April a telegram from the Imam agreeing to all his demands. My general impression is th^t Ibn Saud, haying embarked on the war, is not very eager to call it off. If he finds himself in a strong position, he may even have some idea of asking for an indemnity, a possibility foreshadowded in a report from Koweit, dated the 1st March, a copy of which was forwarded by the Political Resident to the India Office on the 7th March. I have heard no reference to this here during the recent p}iase, but tfte general tpne pf the inspired press has been determined. Thus, on the tfth April, the Uw,m-al-Qura had an article referring to foreign reports of the Imam's strength. According to these reports, said the writer, he could mobilise from 50,000 to 100,000 fighting men. The Saudis knew that he could in fact master twice that number; that he had ^rms left behind by the Turks and collected froni other sources; and that he had gold and silver galore. Yet they must defend their frontiers and believed that God would give them the victory, because they were ^either unjust nor aggressors. 1 . - i 5. I am awaiting to-morrow's Vmm-al-Qura before telegraphing further, the chance of its containing something more than the single definite fact recprded in paragraph 3 above. In the meantime, I turn again to subsidiary matters. ' T]}e Amir ^eisal left Jedda for the south in the small hours of the morning on the 15th April. His passage through this town was exceedingly unostentatious. Before he left, it was announced that his brother Khalid, a mere { 1 ) Not printed. [106 o—2]n lad was to act as President of the Council and Minister of the Interior. No announcement has been published regarding the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. As I write I learn that Fuad Bey Hamza has returned, and that he resumed his duties as Deputy Minister yesterday. As, however, the Amir Feisal is still in the country it must be assumed that he is still technically at the head of the Ministry. 7. I reported in my telegram No. 62 of the 16th April the arrival here on that day of the self -constituted mission of Arab mediators. I believe the list 1 cave was correct, but as the Saut-ul -Hijaz of that morning gave a slightly different Fist of those expected, I cannot be absolutely certain of my own. The party, who landed in pilgrim garb, were met on board by Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and others. They were met at the quay by the Governor of Jedda and a guard of honour. This constitutes a first-class official reception, but I accept none the less readily Mr. Philby 's view that the King holds the mission of little account and regards them as a 'nuisance to be suffered with a show of gladness. Mr. Philby quotes a recent utterance of the King to the effect that only the Iraqis are worth anything and that the others just say ' Ouah ! Ouah !' Nevertheless, I should dearly like to hear the King in converse with leaders of Moslem thought like Haj Amin Huseyni and the Amir Shakib Arslan. 8. The same Saut-ul-Hijaz of the 16th April contains a long article partly or wholly reproduced from the Al Fath newspaper of Cairo in its issue of the 29th March. It purports to give the text of telegrams exchanged between Fuad Bey Hamza and the King and Abdullah-al-Wazir and the Imam, when the Abha Conference had broken down. They are of little present interest, especially as the dates are not given, but the telegram ascribed to Fuad Bey contains one interesting observation, viz. : ' After the conclusion of the Anglo-Yemen Treaty,' he says, ' Abdullah-al-Wazir and his colleagues began to show obstinacy and fraudulence.' 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to Rome and Aden. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Umm-al-Qura, April 13, 1934. O fficial C ommunique N o 3.

It is significant in this connection that the IraSm figures in it as 11 His Majesty the Kinc&gt; ol the Yemen 'c a title never given to him in Saudi ofiicial language before this Treary was drawn up# Apart from the preliminary Eonditions on which Ibn Sa'ud insisted to t-he last, ohere is no single provision, which is not based on the strictest reciprocity. There is no provision for an indemnity and, pace Mr# Philby, no present evidence that Ibn Sa'uc. has got one by some special arrazigement outside the published texts. '. hat it comes to is that he has, at any rate for twenty years, established his 'citle co 'loth parts of 'Aslr an', seo^ Hajr&amp;n; and for these unftoiibteaiy solid cains he has paid a lon-ish price in S'.ilit-.ry ex-ienciture and a certain price in wen.4. V/hether the Treaty can be regarded as in any sence in is d more dufxicul u Qnestion# I niyssXi* am inclined bo think that it amounts to little or nothing of the kind. The peculiar position of the parties as the only two really Independent rulers in Arabia, both ardent xenophobes, has Iriven them into impressive affirmations of their Moslem and Irab solidarity. In this matter, if no other, the mission )f Arah mediators may have made themselves felt. My new 'Iraqi solleague goes so far as to attribute the recurrent phrase about motherhood to the inspiration of the Amir Shakib 'Arslan, ?ith whom it is a favourite catchword. Great play is made dth the doctrine that the people of the two 'countries' 7hich are carefully distinguished, are one '■'nation', but the CL 1 7ord wh&amp;fch, for the want of^better/ equivalent ha'- been translated 'nation' is not used so as to imply any political mity. It refers rather to that ideal unity of Moslems and Irabs which it is the present fashion to acclaim. 5. ''hen all is said and dome there is little to suggest i real pooling of interests except Articles 15 and 17. The former of these is not very explicit. The latter contains a singular a&amp;finition of neutrality, compounded, I think, of the three ideas that neutrality in the European sense is a duty, that a brother's a brother for af that and th^.t it iust as v/ell none the less to ti-gr a brother up in the knots of a formal understanding 11 you ehouM need to tmeVhie neutrality. I an not ignonnij the reference in Article 19 to the poKSloility of m ultiw'ite Cl1 .stoma union but that need not, I think, be tuKen very seriously at present. /6.6. The only other point to vhich I need advert 1b the reference to secrecy in the first paidKof annexed letters. The Saudi letter su^. ests that the Treaty should 'be kept secret, especially the part relative to the frontiers, for fear of disturbances, more particularly in the coafetal region. It might have been supposed that this reason v/ould operate until the Saudi evacuation had been complete, but Ibn Sa ? ud and his Government seem to have been content in the end to delay publication only until their preldbminary condi ti had been fulfilled and the coming into force of the Treaty was assured.

Personalities in Sa'udi Arabia.—{Revised to June 1934.) I ndex. Note on Titles, &amp;c. 1. Sherif. —Said to apply strictly in Arabia to persons recognised as being in the direct male descent from Hasan, the son of the Caliph Ali. There is, however, much confusion as to the exact meaning of this and the following term. 2. Seyyid. —Said to apply in Arabia, though much abused in some other countries, only to persons recognised as being in the male descent from Huseyn, the son of 'Ali. 3. A mir. —Given as a title to all princes of the blood and describes the office of practically all provincial governors. 4. Sheykh. —Applied very widely, but not indiscriminately, not only to tribal personages, but to townsmen of consequence, especially, perhaps, though not exclusively, to those in official positions, e.g., Sheykh Yusuf Yasin. 5. Bey. —Still used, sometimes in preference to Sheykh, by persons who would have been so called by right or courtesy in the Turkish system and who may dislike the association of ' Sheykh with age or desert life, e.g., Fuad Bey Hamza. 6. Hajji. —Convenient, in a country where every Hejazi adult has made the pilgrimage, for certain persons not otherwise easy to give a title to, e.g., Hajji Yusuf Zeinal. n j ov i v 7. Effendi.—StiW applied to persons hardly entitled to be called bheyim anything equally honorific, e.g., Muhammad Effendi Ali Eidha. 8. Ibn, &amp;c. —-Means, like its variant. Bin, 'son of/' or by extension, 'descendant of.' Replaced sometimes by the article ' al, which ^ js not always easy to distinguish from ' al,' meaning 'of the house oi. our forms are illustrated by the name of the Kin g' '' i Z1 . Z i 'Abdurrahman al (son of) Faysal al (of the house of) Sa ud, and tie a re names ibn Sa'ud or bin Sa'ud. The use of the patronymic Ibn bo-and-bo is so common as often to make a man's personal name dimcult to tiace. 9. Abu. —Means 'father.' Used in combination with the name ot an actual son or the name of an object to form a familiar name ^ known in sometimes becomes an accredited surname. Cap am names the desert as ' Abu Hunaik,' or the father of the Little Jaw. Similar names are sometimes formed from other terms of relationship. i -ij i- OTT1 10. Composition of Names.—The most normal &gt; person's own name by adding that of his father and som f ™ es n ^ e ® ^/^ the ancestors and/or a family name. It is n ot uncommon to first Ibn and'place the father's name immediately ato tecribed, e.g., 'Abdullah Ibrahim al-Fadhl first 'lie second of two unseparated names is that of the ' be Muhammad, which is often little more than a pie name of all „ .

King. 1 (1) Abdul-'Aziz ibn Hasan Qusaibi. 78 (1) .AWul-'Aziz ibn Ibrahim. 2 Abdul-'Aziz ibn Mu'ammar. 3 6967 [10293] ^ '\ IEntered into treaty relations with His Majesty's Government through the Govern- iP$ ment of India in 1915. Took Hail in 1921 and finally destroyed power of Beni and, Rashid. Next fought King Huseyn, an old enemy. Took Mecca in 1924 and A completed conquest of Hejaz by compelling abdication at end of 1925 of Huseyn's son and successor Ali. Acquired suzerainty over 'Asir in 1926. Converted position into one of practical sovereignty in 1930 and recently reduced 'Asir to status of ordinary province, following on repression of a rebellion there. Has thus become ruler of territory, seaboards of which extend from just south of 'Aqaba to just north of Medi in Yemen and from Kuwait neutral zone to north 'It of Qatar Peninsula. Ibn Sa'ud has measured his titles by his acquisitions. He became in 1902 Amir of Nejd and Imam of the Wahhabis; in 1921 Sultan of Nejd and its ,,u Dependencies; in January 1926 King of the Hejaz; in 1927 King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies; and finally in September 1932 King of the Kingdom of Sa'udi Arabia, defined as a single and united State, comprising his existing dominions, though without express mention of 'Asir. : 1 The hero of this spectacular aggrandisement is a man of fine presence, some 6 foot 3 inches in height and handsome except for a blotch across the left eye due to neglected leucoma. He combines a strong character with courage, much native shrewdness and a charm which, though now a little stereotyped, is still attractive. He is feared rather than loved by his subjects on all of whom except^ those of the Shi'a persuasion he imposes at least the forms of Wahhabism. Hij • - own Wahhabism is sincere, but tempered by a readiness to compromise when his--* temporal position requires innovations contrary to the prejudice of extremists'^ or sometimes even to the original principles of his sect. On his own ground he |1M0 is an efficient ruler and a hard one, a Napoleon of the desert, but too much of the desert to cope quite successfully with the problems with which his conquest of the Hejaz and his attainment of an international position have confronted him In diplomacy he is normally fairly honest, but difficult. He is as well disposed MM- towards foreigners as is compatible with his fundamental belief that Islam is all ito in all. His relations with Great Britain have been mainly friendly, but he is a friend who expects much for love. He has tried a strong constitution very by living hard and by innumerable marriages. It was reckoned some years ago that he had already had over 200 wives, though never more than the permitted four at a time. He is thought to find the natural decline in his powers in this direction disconcerting, but seems otherwise a hale man, except for digestive troubles and the effects of nervous strain. Was made a G.C.I.E. in 1920, but does not now greatly prize an honour which he considers too reminiscent of a past connexion with the Government of India only and in some sense vassalish. . ^ The King's eldest son Turki died in 1919, leaving issue. The following is a list of the King's immediate relatives,many of whomalsohave issue. Philby's^raftmis ilnki probably the best authority on the Sa'ud family as a whole, but does not claim h k to be absolutely accurate. pin 19: t Sons. All Amirs. ^ (2) Sa'ud ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz. —Born of a lady of Sa'udi stock. Probably not it| v | ( more than 32, if as much. Has for some years been Viceroy of Nejd and seldom | leaves it, though he went to consult an oculist in Egypt shortly after the ' MahmaUi incident' of 1926. Was last in the Hejaz in 1930. Said to have had some schooling from Dr. 'Abdullah Damluji and Sheykh Hafiz Wahba, but to be in the main untutored. Resembles his father in physique and appearance. ; Also suffers from eye trouble, but has inherited Ibn Sa'ud's ' magnetic smile.' w May in other respects be a chip of the old block, but has had little opportunity^' of displaying his quality to Europeans. Is strongly Islamic and may be moresm^ fanatical than his father. &gt;' W Sa'ud is sometimes inaccurately described as Heir Apparent. A report in^ February 1928 that he had been declared to be Ibn Sa'ud's destined successor was not confirmed. When the Kingdom was unified in 1932 it was announced thaUj^ a rule of succession would be established. It is reported that Ibn Sa'ud has since designated Sa'ud as his successor and has obtained the assent of the family, o: perhaps also of a wider circle; but no public announcement has been made. P.S.—Sa'ud's designation as Heir to the Throne was formally announced ^ on the 11th May, 1933.lsu JI 00f .t (ll! r (3) Faysalihn'Abdul-A ^.—Viceroy of the Hejaz in his father's absence and permanently President of the Council of Ministers, Minister for Foreign Affairs the Interior, and, m theory, War. Born of a lady of the family of 'Abdul-Wahhab in or about 1905. Educated partly by Sheykh Hafiz Wahba. Reported intelligent and has at least had moie opportunity than his brothers of cultivating his intelligence and powers of observation as he has lived mostly of late years in the comparatively civilised surroundings of Mecca and has travelled in Europe; I d 1919, when he was in England; in 1926 when he visited England, France,' Holland and perhaps other countries; and in 1932 when he headed the Sa'udi mission which visited London and many other capitals. In physique a much feebler version of his father and elder brother owing to excessive delight in the harem from his youth upwards; possibly also to the use of alcohol and possibly to a tubercular tendency, though neither is proved. Very listless and rather nervous in European company, but can rise to an occasion, as he showed in 1932 by playing his part in London, albeit that of a figurehead, with a good deal of distinction. His decorum is not known to have broken down until he reached Kuwait, where his indulgence in night-life scandalised the Sheykh and his subjects. Is supposed to have succumbed much to Syrian influences, though he seems to have got tired of Fuad Hamza during their grand tour and there have been recent signs of diminished intimacy between them. Believed not to see eye to eye with his father and joined in the onslaught by Fuad, Philby and others on Ibn Sa'ud's principal henchman 'Abdullah Suleyman in October 1931. Although 'Abdullah Suleyman had the best of this in the end, the King has continued to treat Faysal with consideration. Received many decorations during his tour in 1932, including an honorary G.B.E. (4) Muhammad ihn ' Ah did- Aziz. —Aged about 21. Headed the Sa'udi forces which entered Medina in 1925. Was made acting Viceroy when the Amir Faysal went abroad in 1932, but got beyond himself and was replaced by his brother Khalid. Met Faysal at Kuwait on his return and shared in the bout of dissipation there. (5) Khdlid ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz.—Aged about 18. Acted as Viceroy of the Hejaz in 1932 (see (4) above). (6) to (18). Children of 16 and less. The names and order of age are not quite certain. The following is an approximately correct list in alphabetical order, from various sources: 'Abdullah, 'Abdul-Muhsin, Abdur-Rahman, Bandar, Fahad, Mansur, Mash'aL Musa'id, Mutayyib, Nasir, Sad, Sultan, Talal. Two of them, Mash'al and Sultan, are said to be adopted sons, ot the family of the Beni Rashid {q.v.). Brothers. All Amirs.

Some of them rebelled against him in 1910, but the present p 1 : members of the family form portion of the King s posse of satellite princes, $1^ Although inconspicuous, they might produce a claimant, by right of senior fW descent, to the throne. Various names are given in the Almanach de Gotha and Philby's Arabia. The most important of these princes, who bear individually - raids the surname of al-'Arafa, would appear to be— ;|1, 5 (23) Sa'ud ibn 'Abdul-Aziz ibn Sa'ud ibn FaysaZ.—Married the King's sister Nura. Seems to play a certain role in Ibn Sa'ud's entourage. Probably the same Sa'ud al-'Arafa who was described in a recent report from Kuwait as being, according to a reliable informant, a friend of the 'Ajman tribe and secretly hostile to Ibn Sa'ud. 2. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Ibrahim. Governor of Medina. Little is known of this official except that he is believed to come from Hail and is of considerable age. Has the reputation of|^t being a severe and arbitrary Governor. ^ '' 3. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Mu'ammar. Governor of Jedda. A young man of apparently not more than 30. Conies !5 j of a former ruling family of Nejd, apparently the same Beni Mu'ammar of j Ayaina, who were prominent in the early days of the Wahhabi movement and are mentioned several times in Philby's Arabia. Brought up principally at Riyadh. Was Governor of Yanbu' for some time and earned a good reputation there. Was appointed to Jedda in August 1932, with the title of Amir, on the death of Hajji 'Abdullah 'Ali Riza, a leading local merchant who had been governor with the old title of Qaimmaqam since King Huseyn's time. Ibn Mu'ammar seems likely to be a successful governor. He is good- iMng looking and pleasant, but pretentious, probably on the score of his blue blood. He ^ ^ is keen on riding and other forms of sport, and promised to try his hand at polo on receiving from Mr. Hope Gill a parting gift of sticks and balls in return for a dog's-head walking stick. Seems reasonably intelligent for a young man of his upbringing. Not related to Ibrahim ibn Mu'ammar {q.v.). 4. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Musd'id. Second cousin to the King. Governor of Hail since 1925 or earlier. Said by the Sheykh of Kuwait in March 1932 to be only 40, but to have aged greatly owing to worry. Was much in evidence in 1929 as one of the King's right-hand men at the time of the Akhwan rebellion. Came into prominence in February ^ 1930, when, apparently without the King's authority, he conducted a raid on the | ( scale of a punitive expedition, which it was, in fact, intended to be, into : ] Transjordan. Disavowed by the King at the time, but maintained in his governorate. Was in November 1932 put at the head of the principal force despatched to reduce the 'Asir rebels, and proceeded from Riyadh to 'Abha and Jizan, where he assumed supreme command of the forces in 'Asir. Said then to be intended for the Governorate-General of the whole 'Asir area, but now unlikely to remain longer than may be necessary to clean up and reorganise it. A man for occasions requiring drastic action. m M\ z 5. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Shuheyl. Governor of Tebuk in or about 1929. Probably, despite a discrepancy of name, the same ibn Shuheyl of al-'Aridh in Nejd who took over that governorate in 1926. Later Governor of Turaba. Appointed Governor of Taif in September 1932. Commanded the troops sent from Taif in connexion with the repression of the revolt in 'Asir in November-December 1932, and has since been concerned m the arrangements which it was hoped would end in the surrender of Hasan al-Idrisi to Ibn Sa'ud. 6. 'Abdul-'Aziz {ibn Hamud) ibn Zeyd. Inspector of Beduin in Transjordan frontier area. Probably about 40. Comes of a Hail family said to be related to the Beni Rashid. Said to have beeneducated in ConstantinoplG. Sent to Amman, in summer of 1926 to discuss claims in respect of raids, and attended with two other Sa'udi delegates an abortive conference at Ma'an in September. Was one of the two Sa'udi delegates on tribunal which sat at Jericho from February to May 1927 in accordance with _ the Hadda Agreement. Was later an Assistant Governor of Jedda. Sent to 'Amman in August 1930 as Sa'udi agent at the MacDonnell investigation regarding raids. Appointed Inspector of Beduin in the frontier region in January 1931, and has since the 3rd June, 1931, held meetings at long intervals ™ with Captain Glubb, his opposite number in Transjordan. Personally amiable, \ j but will take no responsibility without reference to the King. 7, 'Ahdul-Kerim ihn Rummdn. Governor of Teima. Little information is available about this man, whose family is not mentioned in the 1917 volume on personalities in Arabia. Seems to be important more as a town Sheykh than as a person having necessarily much influence with Beduin, according to a statement made by the Sheykh of Kuwait in 1932. Said to have maintained the quasi-independence of the Teima oasis even against Ibn Sa'ud. Came into some prominence at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932, when he appealed to the Amir 'Abdullah, with whom he appears to have been in correspondence previously, for assistance against the danger of attack by the Akhwan mobilised to repress the rebellion. Reported to be still defiant in January 1933, when he disobeyed the King's order to return certain land to a man who had appealed to the King, and imprisoned the man instead, possibly, it was suggested, because he thought the man likely to murder Mm with the Royal approbation. e than lii sni Mi' ibi moTeiG it up pi r earlier. Iiave ageJ [lug's r adhto it &amp; 0^ itW 1 been^ 1 :r eD(itf ( 8. 'Abdullah ihn Blayhid. A leading figure among the Wahhabi Ulema. Comes from Hail. Qadhi of Mecca after its occupation by Ibn Sa'ud, and was described in Lldon Rutter s account of him (1925—26) as a '' bent and wizened little man. Appointed Grand Qadhi of the He3az in January 1926. Was instrumental m May 192b in obtaining a fatwa from seventeen Ulama of Medina in support oi the Wannabi policy of destroying tombs. Head of the Nejdi delegates at the Moslem Congress of June 1926. Again visited Medina in November of that year m attendance on the King and in the company of 'Abdullah ibn Hasan (see 16 (1)), ent on purging the place of iniquity as Mecca had been purged. Vacated post at i ecca in 1928 and returned to Hail. Was thought at that time to favour the extremists of the Akhwan movement. Still visits Mecca at intervals. Ihought to be embarrassing in high places owing to his frankness and faiiaticism. Signed the ill pronounoemlnt by the Ulama of Nejd in favour of Jihad at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. 9. 'Abdullah ibn Jiluwi. Governor of Hasa. A first cousin of the King s i same age as the King, whom he has served consistent y s P t recapture Riyadh in 1902.

In 1926 Governor of Jauf, but had vacated the post by March 1928, when he fL, was put in command of a force sent to quell the disturbance created at Wejh by 5 ? j Hamid ibn Rifada. Probably identical with the ibn Aqil who was mentioned in May 1931 as a possible candidate for the governorship of Tebuk, but was not fr appointed, 'Abdullah ibn 'Aqil commanded the Akhwan mobilised in June 19321* r , to repress the further rebellion of Hamid ibn Rifada. ^ ^ 12. 'A hdullah ihn Muhammad al-Fadhl. Vice-President of the- Legislative Council. Probably rather over 50. ^ Principal member of the Fadhl family q.v. Was formerly a merchant in Jedda. ^ Described in 1917 as ' anti-Sherif and pro-English' and as going by the sobriquet of ' Englisi ' in Jedda. Put in prison at that time in Mecca for some ' |f a unknown offence. Played no particular role subsequently (and was so little valued for brain-power as to be known as ' the Sheep ') until ex-King 'Ali sent him on ^ a delegation to negotiate with Ibn Sa'ud at Mecca. Went over definitely to Ibn Sa'ud and acted as his representative at Rabigh for the 1925 pilgrimage, in which employment he is said to have feathered his nest. Attached to the King's son, Muhammad, as adviser when the young 'Amir occupied Medina later in 1925. Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926, Obtained about the same period, in partnership with Indians settled in Mecca, a contract for motor transport, but lost it. Did better as purveyor to the Government. Sent on an unsuccessful mission to Eritrea in 1927 in connexion with negotiations for the recognition of Ibn Sa'ud by Italy and proposed treaty s arrangements. Also had some part in the treaty negotiations with Great Britain. lie h Became assistant to the Viceroy at Mecca and so on to appointment to his present i post in or before 1929. Went in that year on a mission to Persia. Alleged in Man the same year to have done nicely in the company of 'Abdullah Suleyman by loflai cornering benzine, &amp;c., just before new duties were imposed. Appears to enjoy IW- the King's confidence in a high degree and to steer an even or waggly course iitEami between rival factions. Not impressive in appearance or conversation; still Mm somewhat of a sheep; but wears his recent dignities with an acquired air of ply be dignity, sobriety and sagacity, which may be a part of his success. May still have commercial interests, but has long been dissociated from the business of the 'Wa, other Fadhls. a of IpDepiit 13. 'Abdullah an-Nafisi. Important as being Ibn Sa'ud's agent at Kuwait, where he is established as imar: a merchant and once did a large business in rice, &amp;c. Now elderly and less active, tee, Seems sensible. 1, W( 14. 'Abdullah Suleymdn al Bassdm. A Nejdi, presumably a member of the Bassam family of 'Aneyza, described in Philby's Arabia as having been formerly staunch adherents of Ibn Rashid. Appointed Inspector-General of Customs in 1930. Was said then to be a penniless man of no character who had lived for two years as the guest of his off namesake the Minister of Finance. Now said to be on very bad terms with the ^ latter. Another al Bassam was mentioned in October 1932 as the consignee of goods shipped from India to Uqair. i . 15. 'A bdullah ibn Suleymdn al Hamddn. Minister of Finance. Aged about 46. Of plebeian 'Aneyza origin. Started life in a small way with the Qusaibis, originally, it is said, as a coffee-boy. Spent ten years as clerk in their Bombay office. Returned to Nejd some twenty years ago. Said to have gone bankrupt as a broker. Recommended by the Qusaibis to replace his brother, who had died, as a clerk in the King's Diwan. Rose to be head of the Diwan. Became Director-General of Finance and had acquired complete control of all financial matters by September 1928, when it was remarked that he travelled in greater state than the King himself between Mecca and ^ Jedda. Has since been the most powerful of the King's advisers. His position was strongly assailed in October 1931 by a cabal, which included the Amir Faysal, , Fuad Hamza, 'Abdullah al Fadhl (perhaps a doubtful enemy) and Mr. Philby 111 I w^as sent for a time to lend a hand with the Tawil mission in Hasa, but had his place kept warm for him and returned to it. Was promoted in August 1932 from being Director-General of Finance to the post of Minister of Finance for the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, thus obtaining the title of Wazir, hitherto enjoyed only by the Amir Faysal, Continues to be supreme in the financial administration and has his finger in many other pies, being in effect Comptroller of the Privy Purse, Grand Master of Ordnance, Quarter-Master-General on occasion, general manager of the King's establishment of slaves and pilgrimage- organiser. Probably entirely faithful to the King, whose needs he supplies at the expense of others having demands on the Treasury. A man of rather mean appearance, but emphatically a 'live wire.' Ready and energetic in conversation and full of ideas about development. Detested by Fuad Hamza and not loved by pany. Has for some time been very friendly with the Indian vice-consul, and has of late been at pains to cultivate relations with His Majesty's Minister. Has enriched himself and has built a pretentious house outside Jedda, which the King made use of in April 1933. Has provided posts for two relatives, viz., his brother Hamad {q-v) and Muhammad, Director of the condensers at Jedda. 16. Abdul-Wahhdb, Descendants of. The following seem to be the most notable of the descendants of the founder of Wahhabism :— (1) 'Abdullah ihn Hasa7i. —Is one of the leading Wahhabi Ulema in Mecca. Played a role in 1926, with 'Abdullah ibn Blayhid (q.v.), in the Wahhabi purging of the Holy Cities, and was in 1929 thought, like him, to favour the Akhwan extremists. Signed the pronouncement of the Ulama in favour of Jihad at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. Now Grand Qadhi. Proud and fanatical. (2) Muhammad ibn 'A bdul- A ziz ibn Sheykh, nicknamed as-Sahabi, formerly Governor of Taif, transferred to Riyadh in 1932 as Assistant to the Amir Sa'ud. (3) 'Abdul-Latif Family.—-^om sons and a^ probable grandson of a descendant named 'Abdul-Latif were among the ten signatories of the declaration of Jihad referred to under (1). No. (2) and the mother of the Amir Faysal {q-v,) also probably belong to this connexion. 17. 'Abdul-Wahhdb, Seyyid. A man of 50 or over. Holds the post of Naib-al-Haram at Mecca. Was formerly Deputy for 'Asir in the Ottoman Parliament, but has never been theie. Of no apparent political importance, but a familar figure in high circles. A jolly little pock-marked man, whose deserved reputation as a raconteur is set on by his appearance. 18. 'Abdul-Wahhdb Abu Malha. A personage of consequence in 'Asir, possibly of the Sheykhly family of Malha near Sabya, although this cannot be affirmed. Was described m 192/ as Director of Finance in 'Asir, and was in that year one oi four delegates sent by Ibn Sa'ud to negotiate with the Imam Yahya. _ Probably- still has the title of Director of Finance and commanded the Sa'udi forces which entered ^abya i November 1932. 19- 'Abdur-rauf as-Sabbdn. Born in the Hejaz forty to forty-five years ago. Grandson of an immigrant from Egypt. Educated in the Hejaz and m Egypt. Associated with his fa , Hasan, and others in what was in 1917 the principal hide and skin busi ness m Jed a and Mecca. Impressed the Hejazis at that time by his knowledge European manners. Was made Director of Education in reverted to trade in cotton goods and skins. Edited m p . ' t F ^ il-Vmma in Cairo with the help of one of the Dabhaghs Given a post by the 'Abdullah as manager of his estates in Transjoi an i „„ T , nec i ; n J932 an active supporter of the Hizb -al-Ahrar al Hijazi, ;i ' r '' ' f ;i Dromo ters of a the press propaganda and financial arrangements of t his movements against Ibn Sa'ud. Seems to have gone a^ast onre to ^ a connexion. Was dismissed by the Amir Alxlullah 1 „ excluded from result of these political activities, but went on with them. Mow excluded tiom [10293]10 If, Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan, and has retired to Bagdad, where he is ^j ^ understood to have become a private secretary to ex-King All. Seems to be one , jjjecti of the most energetic of Ibn Sa ud s Hejazi enemies abioad, and may be expected ^ to continue his efforts, wherever he is. i#' 20. Ahmed 'Abdullah 'Ayshdn. Stated to have brought money from transjordan to Aden in April 1932 for ' e Huseyn ad-Dabbagh. Presumably a member of the Mecca family, two members of which were mentioned in 1917, one as a wealthy merchant, the other, a young ^ i man of 20 named ' 'Abdullah ibn 'Ashan ' (perhaps identical with the subject , of this notice), who associated with King Huseyn's sons and was specially intimate ^ s with the Amir 'Abdullah. 'Abdullah 'Ayshan is one of the persons now excluded ^ anU ' L from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan on account of other anti-Sa'udi activities. 0 011111 21. Ahmed Sa'id al-Kurdi. Director of Police in Jedda. Presumably of Kurdish origin, perhaps distilled flack in through Syria. Was previously Director of Police at Rabigh and gave offence to the Legation by trying to commandeer a car which was taking the Nawab of lit® Bahawalpur to Medina. Was transferred to Jedda in 1932 and confirmed in the fjlestinian post early in 1933. Is said to have stated that he would know how to put the fear : |!7, I of God into the inhabitants of Jedda. Is believed to be anti-foreign, but has not Lga'udi yet put the fear of God, further than it already exists, into the European ^eyd foi community. Seems to be supported by persons in high quarters, including 0 Fel probably Mehdi Bey (q.v.), and, not improbably, the Amir Faysal and Fuad Bey | €tlirn ed Hamza. A man to watch but not to judge too hastily. Rides a horse, a thing now ^jyfair unusual in Jedda, and looks well on it. Was removed from his post in Jedda and ^ Q r a i; apparently reappointed to Rabigh in 1933. jinJedd 22. 'AH al 'Amdri. *** hspq of sq Of Nejdi origin, but settled in the Hejaz before Ibn Sa'ud conquered it. ^ i Probably about 50. Formerly a merchant. Became Director of Customs in Jedda ' , in 1926 and, later, Inspector-General of Customs. Feathered his nest and put a ^ good deal of money into building a house, which he presented or sold to the King, ' but for which, if the latter is the case, he has never been paid. This is the house called the 'Green Palace' outside Jedda. Appointed member of an ■ Inspectorate of Government Departments in 1930 and Assistant Governor of '■ . Jedda early in 1931. Exercised some authority in this post, but does not appear r to count for much nowadays. Probably a rascal, but cheery even now that he has Mee P ar gone poor again. 23. 'All Ridha Family (or Reza as they spell it themselves in English). idicult A rich merchant family in Jedda, of Persian origin. Have very important i business connexions in India and elsewhere, and are agents for the Turner it Morrison Line, which has a monopoly of transporting pilgrims from India by ipsl sea. The best known members of the family were Zeynal 'Ali Ridha, who died some years ago, his son Qasim, formerly a M.P. in Turkey and a man of parts, tnz. : - and 'Abdullah 'Ali Ridha, who combined business with the post of Governor of ; Jedda from King Huseyn's time until he died in 1932. The principal members of the family now in Jedda are :— (1) Yusuf ibn Zeynal 'All Ridha, a pleasant man of 45 or 50, who has been ^ ih much in India; and Ar (2) Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah 'Ali Ridha, a bullet-headed but agreeable lad fas' of little more than 20. ^rima Other members of the family are met with elsewhere. The family has Syrian ^ family connexions, 'Abdullah having married a Syrian or Syro-Persian lady, and ^t-nan his son Mohammad having married last year the daughter of a well-known but decayed Syrian merchant in Jedda, Sadiq' al Khoia. The latter is also connected % ta( with Huseyn Awayni (g.v.). 5 24. 'Ali Taha. Assistant Governor of Jedda since 1928, and, in addition. Assistant Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs since early in 1932. A Hejazi of f nn about 40. Rose from a small post as secretary to the Governor. Cadaverous11 and unhealthy, with a mouthful of gold teeth. Speaks Turkish well. Well meaning, and not without intelligence, but frightened of his own shadow. Completely ineftective, except on the rarest possible occasions, in connexion with foreign affairs. Normally serves as no more than a transmitter of messages to and from Mecca. 25. M. A mm Shanqiti. Said to be a recent import from Shanqit, somewhere in North-West Africa. Atone time resided in Mecca, and became later a member of the Idrisi's Council, apparently with the sanction of Ibn Sa'ud. Was a signatory in this capacity of the decision which signed 'Asir away to Ibn Sa'ud in October 1930. Latterly concerned in anti-Sa'udi activities in connexion with 'Asir. Came to notice in that connexion in July 1932, when it was reported that he had returned to 'Amman from Damascus, whither he had gone on the Amir 'Abdullah's business and to be a bone of contention between the Amir and his Government. Seems to have been back in 'Asir at the time of the rebellion of November-December 1932. 26. M. Amin Tamimi. A Palestinian from Hebron, son of an official at Tulkaram. Came to the Hejaz in 1927. Had known Fuad Hamza in Palestine, and was employed by him in the Sa'udi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Attached to Sheykh 'Abdul- 'Aziz Ibn Zeyd for the purpose of the MacDonnell enquiry, and left with him in August 1930. Fell out with his chief, and was accused inter alia of selling a cypher. Returned separately to the Hejaz and was re-employed in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Was probably still protected by Fuad Hamza, but left the Ministry in or about May 1931, and served for a short time with Sharqieh (Limited) in Jedda. Was by then very much under a cloud, and, according to his own story, had to use a ruse to get away on the 6th August, 1931. He had been accused of some irregularity in accounts, and may already have been under suspicion of stealing documents. Tried later to sell certain copies oi Bntisn secret papers to the Embassy in Constantinople. Surrendered these voluntarily to the Residency at Cairo in June 1932, but may still possess Sa udi documents^ A very nasty young man, unlikely to return to Sa'udi Arabia, but wor mentioning because of his approaches to British authorities elsewhere Was mentioned by the Amir 'Abdullah to General Wauohope, on the 6th September 1932, as one of a number of important and dangerous members of Independence party in Palestine, against whom precautions shou c e a ven. N. 'A qil Family of Mecca. It is difficult to place various bearers of the name of not be related to the Muhammad ibn 'Aqil mentioned 111 , 19 v £ ! th at Mecca merchant, whose grandfather, a learned and ho y ma , p p . the English would take Mecca. A person of the same ^oT^fvinf sons of family deported from Mokalla in 1928, died at Aden in 1931, leaving so , whom one, viz. :— , t a , (1) 'Isa ibn Muhammad ibn 'Aqll was secretary to the Imam s son.

Arrested at Mecca m June Ju y • t t JI Sa'ud said to have (3) 'Ahhds 'Aqil, one of the inspirators Mokalla come on pilgrimage with two other conspnato c &amp; to buy cartridges at Bir Ali.

Rif 29. Ba-Ndjd Family. is 11111116 A merchant family of humble Hadhrami origin, long settled in the HejazJ 1 ^ 0 ^ They have considerable property in Egypt, and are still wealthy. The principal members are the following :— (1) 'A hdur-Rahmdn, the patriarch. Probably over 70, and lives a retired ^ life, but is still going strong as a man of business. .^portant (3) Ahmed, son of (1), had quarrelled with him before 1917. Was . King Huseyn's Minister of Finance in that year, and was ridiculed for his airs, iff n as besides being condemned for his private vices. Returned to Egypt, but returned ' tr ;, to the Hejaz in 1932. ■ S (3) M. Sdlih Ba-Ndjd, another son. I Itb (4) Sufydn Ba-Ndjd, a slave of the family, but now sole manager of the ' i property. He was treasurer to (2) whilst he was Minister. Is a Jedda notable; 5tl0 oo ! lives a quiet life and is respected, though he is a slave. .[jvpUnd All these are well-known in Jedda, where (4) is concerned in a motor ,'^, transport concern. The family appear to enjoy considerable favour under the J;J \ present regime. 30. Ba-Sdhi Family of 'A sir. The principal member of this Hadhrami family, Muhammad Yahya, played an important role in 'Asir at the time of the Great War. They would appear ' , to be still people of consequence there, as three of them were concerned in the ^5 arrangements for the practical annexation of 'Asir by Ibn Sa'ud in October 1930, f \ v i Zi . 1 at under J (1) Muhammad Yahya 'Aivadh Ba-Sdhi. —A member of the Legislative \ ^ Council which signed the decision. Probably the same as the person named above. r 0 ' 1 Seems to have tried to dissuade the Idrisi from revolting in October 1932. ! e ! m (2) 'Ahdul-Qddir ihn Muhammad ibn 'Awadh Ba-Sdhi, also a member of V the Legislative Council. Seems to have helped to get the Idrisi to fall in with ^ 3 the plans of the Dabbagh conspirators in 1932. jf Ir0! (3) Muhammad 'A hdullah Ba-Sdhi. —One of the Idrisi mission sent to Mecca 10 - to complete the arrangements for annexation in 1930. alllallt • 31. Bujdd {or Humayd) Family. A leading family in the notoriously fanatical Ghutghut section of the 'Ateyba tribe. A confusing effect is produced by the use in past reports of the names^ ^ Sultan ibn Bujad, ibn Humayd ibn Bujad and ibn Bujad tout court, but they :rfe i would appear all to apply to one and the same man. This is assumed in what follows regarding :— (1) Sultdn ihn Humayd ihn Bujdd. —Once one of Ibn Sa'ud's stalwarts and MFmih one of the commanders of his troops when they took Mecca in 1924. Had a , 1 daughter married to the King's brother Muhammad. Noted early in 1927 as one ■ of the extremists who were then inclining against the King. Became reconciled ll&gt; a; with him later, but finally stood in with Ibn Sa'ud's opponents in the Nejd rebellion of 1929 and was accounted second only to Faysal ad-Dawish in ever ' importance. Was one of the earlier leaders to fall into the King's hands and ll y s was imprisoned at Riyadh in the spring of that year. Appears to be still in :wo of close confinement, as no record has been found of the death of Sultan ibn Bujad, iiSan^ ^ the best known of the names cited above, and ' ibn Humayd ' was mentioned % avr in a recent report as one of the prisoners who were receiving more lenient^ ^ treatment than before, though, unlike the others, he was still not allowed to see ; his womenfolk. May still prove important, as he had a strong hold on his tribesmen, some of whom have been reported sullen over his imprisonment. (2) Ndif ihn Faysal ihn Humayd. —A pretender to the chieftainship of the^^ '' 'Ateyba, but moved to 'Iraq in 1924, having been ousted by No. (1). Played with ^ y the idea of recovering his position in June 1929 and sent a minor relative, 'Obeyd, to spy out the land, but was apparently dissuaded by King Faisal from going adies o ahead. Mentioned in 1932 as being still a refugee in 'Iraq and as a possible friend aspirant to the hand of Mazyuna, sister of Faysal ad-Dawish, but the engagement or marriage was denied.32, Dabhdgh Family. A Mecca family of 'Moorish' (i .e some North-West Africa) origin. Appear to be beyyids Became prominent in 1932 in connexion with plot behind the revolt o± ibn liitacLa and the preparations for the retarded revolt in 'Asir Tie family is numerous. Certain members of it still reside in the Heiaz' including two who were arrested and deported to Riyadh in June-July 1932^ viz. (1) Ibrahim ibn 'A bdullah and (2) 'Isa ibn 'A bdullah. More important are the following persons abroad:— (3) Huseyn ibn 'Abdullah, brother of the above. Migrated to Mokalla in or about 1926. Has since done school-mastering in South-West Arabia and has been an active intriguer against Ibn Sa'ud. Went to India in 1927 to enlist support for the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi and their National Pact. Sought, and probably enlisted, the support of Shauqat Ali, who, with his brother, had been violently at loggerheads with Ibn Sa'ud at the Moslem Congress of June 1926. Went,to Egypt and perhaps to Transjordan in 1929. Said to have attended Moslem Congress at Jerusalem in December 1931, when persons concerned in Hizb-al-Ahrar seem to have devised a pendant organisation called Jami'at ad Dif'a lil Hijaz. Was using Aden as base early in 1932, but left in summer owing to adverse attitude of British authorities and seems to have since worked mainly in Eritrea. Now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan. (4) M. 'AM ibn 'Abdullah, another brother. Less conspicuous, but also very active. Took a hand in the actual revolt in 'Asir. Reported drowned at Jizan, but report was contradicted later. (5) M. Tdhir ibn Mas'ud, uncle of the above. Born in 1890. Had some employment under King Huseyn. Obtained British-protected passport at Caiio in 1926 on strength of alleged subjection to Sultan of Mokalla. Author of letter from Lahej to Amir Shakir of the 20th February, 1932, which fell into hands of Sa'udi Government and revealed plans of conspirators. Seems to have gone further east, as he arrived at Aden from Singapore early m June Mas since been very mobile, visiting Eritrea, Egypt, Palestine, Transjor an an Now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan.

Dehlavi Family. An Indian family long settled in Mecca. Wahhabis by faith. Still British, but allowed to own real property, and so much identified with the Hejaz that two ^ftieloiig 111 ! members of it sat as representatives in the National Conference of June 1931. ^ ^ They were— (1) 'Abdullah Dehlavi, elder brother (about 57 years old); under Sherifian regime was member of various committees; is a trusted adviser of Ibn Sa'ud, whom he has supported from beginning. Together with (2) is prime mover in the T lt 'Ain Zubeyda Committee. &gt; (2) Oheidullah Dehlavi, younger brother—aged about 53. Chiefly concerned 51 ™ 0 ^ c in management of the family Motor Transport Company ' El-Nijah.' He is an ^ all0cca ' intimate friend of Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman, and like his brother is a trusted re ^| adviser of the King. Both brothers interest themselves privately in affairs of the Sa'udi Government, but are not office seekers. ^Governme .sits were: 35. Fadhl (al-Fazal) Family. iitkbrok Nejdis of 'Aneyza origin long settled in the Hejaz. An original 'Abdullah aitmaintai had at least five sons, all now deceased, with one possible exception. Each of tSi'ldgrudt these had issue. Members of the first and second generations after the original Ag visit 'Abdullah were concerned in firms doing important business in the Hejaz and it lie is am India, where they had a high reputation, enhanced by their position as business iirestill pr agents of Ibn Sa'ud, until 1930. Family differences and bad trade led to the iskvecloi collapse of their business at Bombay and Karachi in that year. The two partners most actively concerned in the business in India absconded to the Hejaz, where a ™ third tried to dissociate himself from the partnership. The affairs of the family i agent ii have for some years been the subject of very complicated litigation and have i as it wi engaged the attention of various British authorities for reasons too long to !t Ammaii. recapitulate. The family still have influential connexions in the Hejaz, and stodotliisl several members of it have been given employment by Ibn Sa'ud. Apart from 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah, who is the subject of a separate notice, the following deserve mention :— (1) Muhammad, son of the 'Abdullah just mentioned. In business in Jedda a rather i and does a tidy trade in benzine, &amp;c. (2) Ibrahim ibn A bdurrahmdn. —One of the two who absconded from India in 1930. Appointed a member of the Legislative Council in October 1930. Became later a secretary to the Amir Faysal. Was called on to resign, ostensibly on grounds of ill-health, by Amir Faysal. He is now living in Mecca and engaged »^ ril f uu in trade in an unimportant way; but is still said to enjoy the confidence of Amir ?n ' ^ Faysal. ' ' (3) Muhammad ibn Abdurrahman ibn 'Abdullah. —Was a partner in the !/, firm which collapsed in India in 1930, but resided in Jedda and tried to dissociate ; himself from the other partners, his brother and cousin. yf™ (4) 'Abdullah ibn Ibrahim ibn 'Abdullah. —Private secretary to the Amir Hat yeai in any ait as a Faysal in 1926. Afterwards one of the partners who absconded from India. T '* 0 a Selected in 1931 for the post of Charg^ d'Affaires in Holland, under scheme which ; ' d: did not materialise for having a Legation there with the Sa'udi Minister in ^ly London as Minister. Appointed Treasurer to the Government later in 1931, as a ; e ftio result of the cabal against 'Abdullah Suleyman. ';H er (5) Ibrahim ibn Suleymdn. —Son-in-law of father of (4), and has taken the ^hdii place of (2) as Rais-i-Diwan of the Amir Faysal. Is an important official and ^givi enjoys Amir Faysal's complete confidence. ' n ^ 36. Fahad ibn Zu'ayr. h fL Late Governor of 'Asir. Was head of the mission sent to 'Asir in May 1930 ^ctinj to make the arrangements which subsequently culminated in its practical annexa- ■ uder-j tion by Ibn Sa'ud. Was later appointed Amir, though probably not the first to ^ined hold the post. Reported to Ibn Sa'ud with increasing urgency in the autumn of Stilted 5 Visit,15 1932 that the Idrisi was getting beyond himself. The Idrisi, professing complete loyalty to the King, complained bitterly of Fahad's rough treatment. The King, anxious to placate the Idrisi, steered a middle course and sent a commission to investigate. Before it could reach the spot the Idrisi had gone into open revolt aI1 d Fahad had to escape from his seat of government at Jizan. Was little heard of for some time afterwards, but was appointed Governor of Qunfida in or about June 1933. 37. Farhan ihn Mashhur. A chief belonging to the Syrian Ruwalla tribe, and hardly within the scope of this report. Nevertheless, deserves inclusion because of the important role he has played in regard to Sa'udi Arabia. Quarrelled with his own paramount chief in 1926, severed his connexion with Syria and embraced Wahhabism. Was concerned in raids from Nejd into 'Iraq and Transjordan in and before 1929. Took a leading part in the rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud that year, in association more particularly with the ' Ajman. Described at that time by the Political Agent at Kuwait, who saw him personally, as a tall man of about 40, speaking Nejdi Arabic, with an occasional break into Damascus patois. Escaped into 'Iraq on the collapse of the rebellion and became the subject of an acrimonious controversy, owing to Ibn Sa'ud's contention that not only the 'Iraq Government but His Majesty's Government were bound by definite undertakings to surrender him. Arrangements were finally made for him to be shephered circuitously from 'Iraq to Jedda, but he broke away in Syria and has since remained there. His Majesty's Government maintained their consistent theory that they had no responsibility and Ibn Sa'ud orudgingly allowed the controversy to be laid during Nuri Pasha's treaty-making visit to the Hejaz in April 1931. Ibn Mashhur has since kept quiet, but he is a man of energy and likely to reappear some day. His natural attaches are still probably with the Hashimites and Nun Sha alan, although his adventures have clouded his relations with both in the recent past. 38. Fawzdn as-SaMq. Sa'udi agent in Egypt. Aged about 45. Belongs by origin to the T l ^ e 7|' the guild, as it were, of recognised caravan-guides. Educated m a . school at 'Amman. Is by profession a dealer m camels and horses and stil 1 appears to do this business. Was Ibn Sa'ud s agent m ^ amas ^ s n P , n fc P i a ii v Moved in that year to Cairo, where he occupies a similar pobi i , , m V i v recognised in any wav, although he does passport wore, c. f as hioned- Mr. Smart as a devout Moslem, plain, slow, courteous a ^ 0 ld-fa s hioned, politically rather innocent, but possessed of a certain native shiewdness. 39. Fuad Bey Hamza. „ t . t u ^ Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs A Druze fr ° m Xl 4 ining about 1900. Educated in Turkish schouls J 11 ' ^ -Deirat Was Inspector of College, Beirut, and the Syrian Protestant Palestine Schools at Damascus for a time, gained P f months and took Department of Public Health ^Vf iv.^ fs^ tloaer in IcTe Transferred in service under the Department of Educati j English and remained until 1922to a secondary school m Jerusalem as teacher m Certificate of Legal 1926.

Had probably worked eariiei became titular Mini st er with Remained Acting Minister until the r ^ ad of the Ministry m December Fuad as Under-Secretary, but stl11 e n th Council of Ministers when the latter 1930. Retained his post, with a seat on t ^ ^ hiinS elf in English Deputy w as constituted early in l 932, ? . time as a member of the Sa udi Mission Minister. Visited Europe for the first time16 d The under the Amir Faysal in the spring of 1932 and did all the real business. Was ''Jsreg made an honorary K.B.E. during the visit to London. Fuad Hamza is alert, intelligent, well informed on matters pertaining to his work and industrious. Speaks English well and Turkish, but is hampered by iLtltf lack of more than elementary French. Equally devoted to his own ambitions and to the cause of Arab nationalism, serving Ibn Sa'ud as its exponent, though ,, : , a u inclined sometimes to despair of the system of which he has made himself part.. Keeps in touch with other Nationalists in Palestine, and probably Syria. Is used t by the King as his instrument for foreign affairs, and makes the most of wj- his position, but probably does not enjoy Ibn Sa'ud's full confidence, so that his ii power varies. Very hostile to 'Abdullah Suleyman and took part in the ^ re , unsuccessful drive against him in 1931. Conforms to Wahhabism without conviction. Would like to see Sa'udi Arabia, a name of which he was one of the authors, develop on modern, more or less constitutional lines. Likes drafting laws. Would go to great lengths for the causes he has at heart, but is seldom, if ' ^ ever, dishonest in diplomacy. Rather bumptious and sometimes difficult to deal . with, but responds to personal handling. Sometimes spoken of as anti-British, V sometimes even as pro-Soviet; probably wrongly, except in so far as his attitude towards foreign Powers is determined by Arab nationalism. May have put by :,; FW a modest amount of money, although the only traceable record of anything : s ® nn approaching corruption is an allegation in 1929 that he bought large stocks of M a ^ tobacco before promulgating a decree imposing new duties. jtHoteh Taufiq Hamza, Fuad's brother, serves under him in the Ministry, but does ^ not merit a separate notice. Speaks French. Myliisei 40. Gdbil Family (more correctly Qabil, but they use the other spelling). Important merchants in Jedda of African slave origin. Take their name ^reti from an extinct Jedda family, one of whom owned the father, later a freedman. , Mr y U i] The firms consists of the two following brothers :— '^5 (1) Suleymdn Amdn Gdhil. —Aged about 60. Worked up an important ^ ^ business connexion with Medina, India, &amp;c., in his early days. Paid President fWon of the Municipality in Turkish times, and held the same post under King iW-Q Huseyn. Had at that time a poor reputation for honesty. Took a leading part IsGover in the movement by notables of Jedda and Mecca to compel King Huseyn's wolt ,l] abdication in October 1924. Went to Port Sudan in March 1926 as one of' the delegates sent to negotiate about the Eastern Telegraph Company cable and was more helpful than his colleague, 'Abdullah Kazim {q.v.). Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. A Vicar of Bray under three successive regimes, but can be outspoken, as when he displeased the King ^ by his frank criticism of fiscal policy at the 'National Conference' of June ' Jsac ^ 1931. Described in 1928 as ' a lively and entertaining host.' Still pleasant to meet and apt to be met in Royal circles. Speaks moderate Turkish. ^land (2) 'Abdul-Qddir Amdn Gdhil, several years younger than Suleyman, in ^anis whose wake he follows at a distance. 41. Hdfiz {Hdfidh) Wahha. as Sa'udi Minister in London. An Egyptian born probably between 1885 and ?a nic 1890. Educated at Al-Azhar. Mixed up in Nationalist and pan-Islamic politics ^onn in early manhood and was closely associated with 'Abdul-'Aziz Shawish. ^1-32 Definitely anti-British at time of Great War and said to have been deported from ^aa: India. Later started a school at Kuwait and passed thence into Ibn Sa'ud's service. Became tutor to the Amir Faysal and accompanied the prince to London in 1919. W as one of Ibn Sa'ud's delegates at the abortive Kuwait Conference ^ in 1923-24. In supreme charge of the civil side of the Administration at Mecca , u in 1925, with a viceregal title, and did well. Read the King's inaugural address at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Much employed on missions and negotiations during the ensuing years. Inter alia took part in negotiations with Sir G. Clayton in 1925, 1927 and 1928 and expounded Ibn Sa'ud's views and fears regarding Italian policy in the Red Sea, Bolshevik activity and Hashimite sovereignty in neighbouring countries to the Residency at Cairo early in 1928. During all this period waged a ding-dong struggle against the Syrian influences around the King, and had ups and downs. Was occulted towards the end of 1926, but returned to favour soon after and became Assistant Viceroy beside theAmir Faysal. Thought to have indisposed the Amir by his masterfulness as a tutor and his disregaid as Assistant yioeroy for the Amir's position. Relegated i, July 1928 to the post of Director-General of Education. Went to London in 1929 to represGnt ibn oa ud at the International Postal Congress. While there was selected for the P^st of Minister in London, but did not take up the post for over a year, during which interval he went on a sort of undefined mission to Kuwait and was also employed much about the King's person, though he appeared on the whole to have lost ground to the Syrians. Has during his tenure of the Legation in London icpresented his country on international occasions, at Geneva and elsewhere, and has only once been back in Sa'udi Arabia. Was designated in 1931 to be Minister at The Hague, but the arrangements have never materialised for reasons of economy. Hafiz Wahba has sown his political wild oats. His anti-British sentiments are supposed to have undergone a change in or before 1928, when he was reported as being accustomed to say that, as regards Egypt, he would always be against Great Britain, but, as a servant of Ibn Sa'ud, believed the King's interest to lie in friendly relations with His Majesty's Government. He has certainly shown himself well-disposed in London, and has on occasion been distinctly helpful. He is a good propagandist for Ibn Sa'ud on the lecture platform and in society. Neither taciturn nor talkative, he appeals by his sense of humour and looks any thing but a Wahhabi (except that he abstains from alcohol and tobacco) at the Hyde Park Hotel or the Savoy. Likes the theatre too. Speaks moderate English, but is not fluent. A useful servant to the King, whose respect he commands, but not probably his entire confidence. 42. Hamad Suleymdn. Under-Secretary of State for Finance, brother of 'Abdullah Suleyman, q.v., and has worked under him. Acted for him as Director-General of Finance during his relegation to Hasa towards the end of 1931. Was appointed Wakil or Under- Secretary when 'Abdullah was made Wazir or full Minister in August 1932. Has been employed on missions in ' Asir, notably in November 1932, when he was sen with Khalid-al-Qarqani to investigate the differences between the Idrisi and Ibn Sa'ud's Governor. They were too late to reach the spot before the idrisi wen into open revolt, but have since been standing by in Asir. 43. Hamdi Bey. ,. , Director-General of Military Organisation.

Hamza al Ghauth al Madani. ^ the Understood to be consul-general designate for Java. A Hejazi of Medina, aged over 40. Said to have been educated in Turkish schools and to have#^ 1 frequented Turkish society. Sided with Turks at time of Arab revolt, and edited an anti-Huseyn paper at Medina in their interest. Continued to be anti-Huseyn issoci^ 1 after the success of the revolt and fled. Said to have been sentenced to death by ftla i or default during his absence. Seems, nevertheless, to have been given an important post at Damascus, which he continued to hold under King Faisal's regime there, even after King Huseyn had launched against him an accusation, probably ^grou] trumped up, of having stolen valuables from the Prophet's Tomb. Was inpsof Ibn Sa'ud's service by end of 1923 and was one of his delegates at the abortive Kuwait Conference of 1923-24, an appointment which led to a revival by the 'Iraqi delegates of the robbery charge. Became Assistant Governor of Medina m after its occupation by Sa'udi forces in 1925. Was later employed in the Palace. Selected in 1931 for the proposed consulate-general at Batavia, to the creation of which the Netherlands Government agreed, but which has never been opened, i®® I probably owing to financial difficulties. Filled in time as a member of the J® ^ Legislative Council, whence he was transferred to the Amir Sa'ud's Diwan ini^ September 1932. Came in King's train to Mecca in March 1933. Much of a s^is palace man evidently. a fas s 47. Hashim Daghestani, called Sayyid Hashim. T ^ A Hejazi, aged perhaps 50 or more, descended from a family of Mutawwifs ^ate i who derived their name from the fact that they looked after the pilgrims from ^ o f ■ Daghestan. This was a lucrative business in the good old days, and Sayyid i Hashim was formerly well off. He seems to have lost a great deal during the war between Ibn Sa'ud and King 'Ali, and has also lost heavily by being loaded up with now worthless roubles. Was formerly employed in the Awqaf Department, ; apparently in King Huseyn's time. Appointed ' Chief Revenue Officer ' under ^ the new regime in January 1926, and was later local Director of Finance in Jedda. Ejected from this post and appointed a member of the Inspectorate of Government Departments in 1930. Has since been employed in various financial connexions and hunts in couples with Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman, but his real importance lies in the fact that he is said to have an independent position as a sort of personal secret service agent of the King, and to correspond with the latter, when His Majesty is in Nejd, about persons and things in the Hejaz. Is on intimate terms with the Indian vice-consul, to whom he sometimes supplies information. This connexion was of some value during; the early stages of the m 'Asir revolt of November-December 1932. -JJ •ipar t 48. Hithlayn Family. People of importance in the 'Ajman tribe, much concerned in the Nejd revolt : e 5 of 1929. Its principal member, Dhaydan ibn Hithlayn, was slain treacherously in April of that year. Ihe following other members of the family deserve mention :— ilispr ■^r was ii( i,as in pr( si (1) Naif ihn Hithlayn (nicknamed Abu 1 Kilab).—Succeeded Dhaydan and carried on the revolt, but surrendered in January 1930 to the British authorities m Kuwait, and was in due course handed over to Ibn Sa'ud. Has since been a State prisoner at Riyadh, closely confined. (2) Hdzim ihn Hithlayn also took an active part in the revolt, and was one 51%^ of two leaders who in July 1929 visited Kuwait in the hope of enlisting support. Was fighting together with Naif in October. Eventual fate unknown. (3) Khdlid ihn Muhammad ihn Hithlayn, described as a ' debonair and ? . aiIlai handsome young warrior. ' Is one of the Mutavr and 'Ajman Sheykhs living in Iraq under King Faisal's protection. Visited Kuwait in 1932 at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair, apparently to size up the chances of new anti-Sa'udi action. 5?^ Nlef 49. Huseyn al 'Awayni. ^ A O • i . . 0i I1T A young pynan merchant established in Jedda. An enterprising fellow, who '^ou ; derives some importance from being a friend of Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin Jiipid ^d'n^r' k 19 and connexions in Manchester; notably with another Syrian, 'Abdul- Ghani Idlibi, the natuialised British head of a small company there. This association was close eaily in 1932, when ^dlibi visited Jedda in order to work business and with gieat ideas of getting concessions of all sorts. They claimed t0 have important support in Lancashire, and specifically that of the Calico Printers' Association (Limited). It was understood in 1932 that 'Awayni was leaving Jedda for good, but he returned. His last important appearance was in February or March 1933, when he went to Riyadh on behalf of certain merchants t 0 try and dissuade the King from proceeding with the concession to the ex -Khedive's group for the creation of a National Bank. A man likely to have ups and downs of fortune, in dealing with whom commercially great care should be used. 50, M. Huseyn Nasif. A well-known Hejazi of Jedda of Egyptian origin. Aged about 50 or more. Inherited much property from his father, 'Omar Nasif, who was a notable personage in Turkish times, as well as the agency in Jedda of the Sherifs of the 'Abadilah branch. Occupies the largest house in Jedda and was once very prosperous, but is now probably less so. Was said in 1917 to have lost favour with King Huseyn, who had previously been accustomed to stay with him when in Jedda. Was said also to be desirous of British naturalisation at that time. Described as having been a Wahhabi by conviction, even before the Sa'udi invasion. Deported to 'Aqaba during King 'Ali's short reign. Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Was given the privilege of putting Ibn Sa'ud up during the years following the Jail of Jedda, but has not done so since the King acquired the ' Green Palace.' Has not held office, as was expected, under the Sa'udi regime, perhaps owing to doubt as to his trustworthiness. Rather a dark horse nowadays and may both dislike and be disliked by the regime, but keeps quiet. Said to be a good Arabic scholai and possesses what passes in Jedda for a remarkable library. An aldei manic figure. 51, Ibrahim ihn MiCammar. Head of the Amir Sa'ud's diwan, or secretariat, at Riyadh. Was formerly »well-known propagandist and press correspondent for Arabic papers an seems to have spent some years in Egypt and India. Probably identica y 1 . . ® ' Muammar Bey ' mentioned in the Jedda report for February , § ken Neidi representative in Egypt and having just been appom e J;. ,, the Foreign Political Intelligence Department and chief advl ® er '° : he ^['f 1 Would appear to have become head of the King's diwan ^ ]v af ^ in July 1926. Little known in European circles but probably 'iportant Ibn Sa'ud's entourage. Was transferred m September t0 ^ an ti ° the Amir Sa'ud. This transfer, if effective, need not be regarded as lelega ^ loan inferior post, as it may quite well have been P a ,2, , Ibrahim ihn Amir for his probable role of successor to the throne. 1 4 ee flS 1 ( 2 ^ od .3ted and Mu'ammar wa P s described by ^Bagdad pro -British man.

The brother Yasin Rawwaf, whom he succeeded, is said to have become Governor of Medina in 1929-30. He was appointed second assistant to the Viceroy of the Hejaz in September 1930, but has faded out of Sa'udi official life and now lives at Damascus. P.S.—'Id Rawwaf was superseded as consul at Damascus by Rusheyd Pasha {q.v.) in May 1933 and appointed an Assistant Under-Secretary of State for ^ Foreign Affairs. 53. Idrisi Family. Founded by Ahmed al Idrisi, a native of Fez, who became a notable religious teacher at Mecca and created a Tariqa, or school of religious doctrine. Moved on to Sabya, in 'Asir, where he acquired land and died in the odour of sanctity about 1837 and where his tomb is still venerated. The Idrisis supplanted the Sherifian family, which had ruled at Abu 'Arish in the time of his son Muhammad ^ and Muhammad's son 'Ali. The branch of the family most identified with stlearri 'Asir is descended from these two, as appears from the following table, which is d ^ not necessarily complete or accurate as regards order of birth : — awaaft Ahmed, the founder J ■riian n I lofanc Muhammad Igllt pi 'Ali Ijesty's aiewei regai ; news- (1) Muhammad, died 1923 (2) Hasan Ifflt in fasati i at the (3) 'Ali (4) 'Abdul- (5) 'Abdul- 'Abdur- Hasan iilajest Wahhab 'Aziz Rahim or Ahmed gj The numbered members of this branch deserve further notice. (1) This Muhammad was a notable man in his day. Born in 1876. Studied iiliemb an bet? in Egypt and at Kufra. Organised opposition to the Turks in 'Asir in and &gt; after 1904. Made treaties with His Majesty's Government through the Resident at Aden in 1915 and 1917. Came to terms with Ibn Sa'ud in 1920, when he ceded to him any rights he might have in the country about 'Abha. ' (2) Displaced (3) in 1926, after complicated events. Accepted in that year 1 the suzerainty of Ibn Sa'ud by a treaty signed at Mecca. Accepted in October 1931 the practical annexation of 'Asir by Ibn Sa'ud, retaining a simulacrum only ^UGh of quasi-sovereign rights. Joined in the rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud in November , . 1932, and on its collapse in due course took refuge in Yemen. After strenuous ' ; efforts to obtain his surrender, Ibn Sa'ud agreed recently that he should remain in the Yemen under the Imam's supervision, and accorded him a pension. Appears to be a man of weak character, very amenable to influence. Was | described some years ago as ' monkish.' 3^ (3) Succeeded his father in 1923. Was upheld by the Masariha and other ; tribes in 1924 against an attempt to displace him by his cousin Mustafa. No. (6), ; who established himself temporarily at Hodeyda, then an Idrisi possession. 'Ali, i j 1011 in turn, lost Hodeyda to the Imam in 1925, and was displaced by (2) in 1926. I 10 ® Returned to Mecca in August 1926, and seems to have lived mostly there until ■ ' he was suddenly arrested and deported to Riyadh in the summer of 1932, under ,! M suspicion, apparently, of intending a coup in 'Asir. Recently attempted to ; 5 tlie escape. Was foiled, but did not die, as was rumoured. M ' (4) And (5) were very active in organising and conducting the 'Asir revolt of November-December 1932. te ^ec The original Ahmed has a numerous posterity through another son, variously ^ ^ called ' Abdul-Al or 'Abdul-Mutal. His descendants have been principally ^ . ( associated with Dongola, where his tomb is a place of pilgrimage, and with Egypt.The following table shows only those of the branch who have come to notice in connexion with Arabia m recent years :— Ahmed, the founder I ! 'Abdul-Al Muhammad Sharif (8) Mirghani (6) Mustafa Senusi (9) 'Abid (7) M. Al-'Arabi (6) Was a trusted British agent during the Great War. Later played a role in opposition to his cousin 'Ali, No. (3). Died in Egypt in 1930. (7) One of the 'Asir delegation which came to Mecca in October 1930 to complete the arrangements for the absorption of 'Asir into Ibn Sa'ud's dominions. Concerned in the rebellion of November-December 1932, and left with No. (9) for Massawa after it collapsed. (8) Has been politically active for many years. Works normally, it is alleged, in the Italian interest, but played an apparently pro-Sa'udi role in 1926-27, at the time of and after the establishment of Ibn Sa'ud's suzerainty over 'Asir. Visited Mecca at least three times from September 1926 to September 1927. Was thought perhaps to aspire himself to the post of ruler of 'Asir. Visited His Majesty's agent and consul in Jedda on the 15th September, 1927. Mr. Stonehewer Bird described him at that time as being the King's unofficial adviser in regard to 'Asir and Yemen. He found him a man of intelligence and broad views—pro-Sa'udi, but not pro-W r ahhabi. Accused by the Sa udi Government in 1932 of again serving Italian interests, and of being concerned in the political plot behind the 'Asir revolt. (9) Much concerned in the 'Asir revolt of November—December 1932. Was at Jizan at the crucial time, and attempted by a letter and a visit to Kamaran to get His Majesty's Government to recognise what he represented as the restoration of Idrisi rule. Withdrew early in 1933 to Massawa, with his relative M. Al- 'Arabi, No. (7). All members of the familv have the title of beyyid. There is a close connexion between the family and the Senusis whose founder was a disciple ot the original Ahmed al Idrisi. The spiritual relationship has een rem or y intermarriage at various times. The Idrisis have also a connexion ^ _ Mirghani family, whose head resides in the Sudan, and is c le } Tariqa, once powerful and still important. 54. Ismail Ghuznavi. Of Amritsar in India.

Jemdl Pasha Ghdzi {Ghazzi). A man of about 50. Of Syrian origin, but born at Gaza in Palestine; hence his surname. Graduated in the Turkish Staff College. Said to have been a member of a Turkish Military Mission lent to the Sultan of Morocco in 1910, to have seen service later in Gallipoli and to have been A.D.C. to Enver Pasha, to Wj whom he claims to have been attached up to shortly before the armistice. Went ] to Basra after the armistice to manage the property of his wife, the daughter of ^ a rich landowner there. Visited India more than once from Basra. Fell out ^ with his wife and applied to Mustafa Kemal Pasha for employment, which was ^ refused, possibly because of his past association with the C.U.P. Entered the ^1° service of Ibn Sa'ud and commanded the artillery during the siege of Jedda. 11 'Went to 'Asir in 1926 and was reported late in that year to be running Hasan ' al-Idrisi in company with Ahmed es-Senusi and Mustafa al-Idrisi. Was reported in 1927 to be an Italian agent, trying to undermine Ibn Sa'ud's position in 'Asir. #^ Re-employed later in the Hejaz. Was serving in the Amir Faysal's household ^ early in 1931 as a sort of chamberlain, and was then scandalously spoken of as ^ders M. le Procureur. Accompanied the Turkish Prince Ahmed Tewhid to India, with the permission of Ibn Sa ud, in May 1931. Travelled a good deal after wards, posing as Minister of War in the Sa'udi Government. He appeared in ^ Jerusalem in November 1931 and played an ambiguous part in connexion with the ' then impending Moslem Congress. Whether he eventually attended it or not is not known in Jedda. Returned to India in June 1932 and continued alone the propaganda in favour of the pilgrimage which he and Prince Ahmed Tewhid had initiated in 1931. In a secret report from India of February 1933, he is stated to have expressed in one quarter the intention of enlisting Indian Moslem - interest in Ibn Sa'ud's claim to 'Aqaba. Returned to the Hejaz for the 1933 it pilgrimage. Jemal Pasha is presentable though unpleasantly fulsome. He speaks French some English and probably other European languages. He is almost certainly a 3 man of loose and untrustworthy character. His recent activities in India give him a certain importance. He is doubtless rewarded for his propaganda in ^ he P 11 ^ 1 ™^ 6 ' but should not be regarded as a responsible 'agent of Ibn fea ud tor any other purpose. He is a mere hanger-on. 56.

Three of them became prominent in 1932 in connexion with the activities of the political organisations behind attempts to undermine Ibn ba ud; viz., the Hizb al Ahrar al Hijazi and the Jami'at al Difa lil Hijaz. Actively connected with the organisation are— (1) 'Abdul Hamid al Khatib, and (2) * Abdul Malik al Khatib— who appear to be permanently settled in Egypt and to have property there. (2) may possibly be identical with a man of the same name who was described in 1917 as a Javanese of Mecca, well educated, who had been correspondent of the Mokattam and had influence with King Huseyn. A third person, viz.— (3) Huseyn Ali al-Khatib— lived at Lahej in 1932 and seems to have squandered in riotous living at Aden, &amp;c., money given him by Huseyn ad-Dabbagh for the purposes of the plot against Ibn Sa'ud. It is understood that Fuad al Khatib, formerly Foreign Secretary to King Huseyn and now secretary to the Amir 'Abdullah, is not related to this family. 59. Ldmi Family. A Sheykhly family of the Jiblan section of the Mutayr tribe. Concerned in the Nejd rebellion of 1929. Not apparently of great consequence, but worth mentioning, because Jasir ibn Lami was one of the Akhwan leaders who surrendered to the British authorities in Kuwait in January 1930, and was in due course handed over to Ibn Sa'ud. He has since been a State prisoner at Riyadh, and is one of those who were recently reported to be receiving more lenient treatment than before. 60. Ldri Family. Persian Bahais long settled in Jedda. (1) Muhammad 'Alt Ldri, the head of the family, is a charming old gentle man, now close on 70, probably. Was the principal carpet merchant in Jedda and rich, having an important connexion with Egypt. Health now impaired, but is still in business and highly considered. Has in the past acted as Peisian consul, as did his father before him. Reads poetry and likes to commune with natuie. (2) Ahmed, son of the preceding, is in the business in Jedda. Was m charge of Persian afiairs in his father's absence in 1925, and was reported to have come much under the influence of the then Soviet representative, Hakiraov urged Ibn Sa'ud at that time, according to Ibn Sa'ud himself, to join m a great Eastern Union against the imperialistic Powers, with Persia and Afg anis an m i Russia supporting.

Mahmud Hamdi Hamude. . r 0 Director-General of Public Health. A Syrian of Damascus, born about 1882. Studied in Beirut and Constantinople. Spent in all sixteen or seventeen years in latter place. Served in Turkish army during and up to end of war, after which he settled in Syria. Held post in some hospital there under the French and was professor of rhino-laryngology at Damascus. Left Syria, apparently for political reasons, and joined Ibn Sa'ud in Nejd early in or before 1925. Appointed to his present post in January 1926 and represented Ibn Sa'ud, as ^ j King of the Hejaz, at the International Sanitary Conference of 1926. Seemed '' caI1 likely to be eliminated in August 1927 with other Syrians and was said to have resigned but to have been kept on pending an audit of accounts. Evidently \ weathered this storm. Was Sa'udi representative at meeting of International ! ^ ustC Health Office in autumn of 1932, following on accession of Sa'udi Arabia to Rome Convention. Speaks good Turkish and moderate French. Probably has reasonable medical attainments, but gives no impression of real capacity as Director-General 1^ of Public Health. 63. Mahmud ShalMb. ®fV l r s r jj], Director of Finance in Jedda. Comes of a Mecca family, one of whom was 4wc described in 1917 as controlling the distribution of Zemzem water, a very : , .n lucrative job. Mahmud, who must be over 50, was employed in Turkish times as ' - - a Government clerk in Mecca, and was later chief clerk in Huseyn's financial '. department. Continued to be employed in Mecca under the new regime and was Ij' cl r appointed to his present post in 1930. A decent seeming man, but plays no C,, important role in a domain in which 'Abdullah Suleyman is supreme. Replaced V L( in his post as Director of Finance in Jedda by his clerk, 'Abdullah Zakir, in June 1933, and transferred to Mecca as head of the General Accountancy section of the Ministrv of Finance. .. M-hi 64. Mehdi Bey. : Director-General of Police with headquarters in Mecca. An 'Iraqi, who ■■■'w has, however, lived little in 'Iraq. Said to have been a regimental clerk in the Turkish army, in which a brother of his is still an officer. Was employed also in T. \ King Huseyn s army. What little is known about him to the Legation is unfavourable. He appears to be arbitrary and ruthless and to wield considerable V; authority, not always deferring even to the Viceroy. This account of him is given with reserve. 65. Ihii Mubarak. Sir of A man of this name would appear to be Governor at Burayda, but is only 1 ^ known to the Legation from a reference to him in a letter from Ibn Sa'ud to the ff 80 ! Sheykh of Kuwait of the 30th December, 1931. The post is important, as it is . ^' the administrative capital of Qasim, not including, however, 'Aneyza, which has its own Governor, probably hereditary, and depends directly on the King. iec,lst 65 a. Ihn Mubarak. , . Governor of Dhaba. Little known to the Legation, which cannot even trace ^ his first name, but worth mentioning because of the importance of his post in relation to Egypt and Transjordan, and because he was one of the leaders of the forces with advanced base at Dhaba, employed against Ibn Eifada in 1932. Is possibly a tribal personage rather than an administrative Governor, and may be td u i / Huse y n ibn Mubarak of the Harb tribe, who was a power at liabigh at the time of the Arab revolt. Later information. This man, whose first name is 'Abdur-rahman, was transferred from Dhaba to Weih in or about June 1933. J %liyj *12 i, 66. Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan. An actively anti-British Indian, who, like Ismail Ghuznavi, cannot bi, appropriately be dealt with at length in this report, but has resided much in Mecca, and has been associated more particularly with the Holy Carpet factory oi Dar-ul-Kiswa, a rallying-place for Indian sedition-mongers. S(*25 fft Muhdimnad ibn Sultdn. Commander of Ibn Sa fid s camelry in the Hejaz. As such played an important part m the suppression of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932 Was also a powerful and much-feared element in the machinery set up to Wahhabise public morals in Mecca until its rigours were relaxed. 68. Muhammad at-Tawil. A native of J edda of Egyptian origin. Got a small post in the customs in Turkish times and rose to be Director of Customs in Jedda under King Huseyn played a leading part in the movement of the Hejazi notables to compel Huseyn's abdication and the accession of King 'Ali in October 1924. Remained in theory Director of Customs only, but wielded great influence under 'Ali, and was described as being ' practically dictator ' in November 1925, after his triumph in a dispute with Ahmed Saqqaf, the Prime Minister, who decided to leave. Promised at that time to devote to the cause of the Hejaz every penny of ' certain economies '' which he had effected while Director of Customs. Left the Hejaz on the fall of Jedda, but returned in 1927 or early in 1928 and started a motor transport business. Was said in 1928 to have been president of the Hizb-al -Ahrar al Hijazi, but made his peace with Ibn Sa'ud after an absence at Riyadh, which was described in February 1928 as a deportation. Was slow to receive official employment, and was perhaps considered unsuitable for such employment in the Hejaz, but was in September 1930 placed at the head of a commission to study and reorganise the financial and economic situation in Hasa. Has remained since then in this employment, despite rumours of assassination or flight. Appears to have tightened up regulations and trodden on Qusaibi corns in the process, but not to have made the Hasa customs as paying as he hoped. A capable and well-reputed man, liked by the authorities at Bahrain. fiQ Mm how nl-Firm ' Principal chieftain of the Eastern Harb tribe in Nejd.

He appears to have been ^ employed at Tebuk and perhaps at Yanbu' in the ensuing years. He became^* notorious in February 1930 for a large-scale raid into Transjordan similar to that ' of 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Musa'id {q.v.) about the same time. He was apparently at&gt;A &gt; the time already Governor of Jauf, a post from which the King dismissed him i 1 ®, 0 about the end of the year, not, it was explained, because the man was bad, but ■ because the King desired to eliminate causes of quarrel with His Majesty's;^. Government. Reappeared subsequently as Governor of Al-'Ula, but was:^ s transferred to an unspecified post in or about June 1933. Is now (May 1934) oneif ? of the more important subordinate commanders in the Western Army on the'A 8 Saudi-Yemen border. 74. Oheidullah, Maulvi. 35W1MC An Indian permanently established in Mecca. Has had a lurid past in India, having been at one time closely connected with the Bolsheviks and been involved in the Silk Letter conspiracy, &amp;c. Was mentioned in March 1927 as a man whointi/ was attracting modest notice in Mecca as a lecturer on the traditions of the Prophet, and as belonging to the class of migratory agitators '' whose flight is Kabul, Moscow, Berlin and Constantinople.' Appears now to carry much weight jcipalit as a religious teacher and is much frequented by Indians. Probably uses his.iableto influence in a definitely anti-British spirit, but has not come to notice latterly as forks i a direct participant in conspiracies in India. Jmtlitli ;lj -Jtmeto 75. Othmdn 'Arab. lafaini A Hejazi, whose past connexion with the Hejaz is not known to the Legation, lis ^ Came to notice in 1932 as one of those concerned in the Dabbagh conspiracy of the against Ibn Sa'ud. Was described as a man of 50 to 55, fairly wealthy, normally nglt-hs resident in. Egypt, but in the habit in 1931-32 of visiting Jerusalem and holding Morgan telephone conversations with the Amir 'Abdullah and Abdur-Rauf Sabban. Was supposed to be an intermediary between the Hejazi conspirators in Egypt and the Amir. Was certainly concerned in the anti-Sa'udi plot and is now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan. 7^ 76. Philhy, H. St.-J. B., C.LE., since 1917. ^ Born in Ceylon 1885. Educated at Westminster and Trinity, Cambridge. !to lie (i Passed for Indian Civil Service in 1907 and had normal career in India from 1908 Mtione to 1915, when he was detached for service in 'Iraq. Sent on mission to Central ii,wh( Arabia in 1917-18, visited Ibn Sa'ud and crossed Arabia Peninsula from 'Uqayr n trac to Jedda. Employed in Ministry of Interior in 'Iraq in 1920-21 and as British i desp representative in Transjordan from 1921 to 1924, when he fell out with His idliy A Majesty's Government and tendered a welcome resignation from that post. Retired on a pension from the Indian Civil Service in 1925, but had already 'ilkl-'. embarked on the recent career which entitles him to a place in this report. Came pus; ^ to Jedda in November 1924, shortly after the accession of King 'Ali, by whose father, Huseyn, he had been decorated in 1923. Was said, in 1924, to believe ;1 iealim that republicanism was the nostrum for the Arab world. Was regarded on his^tQ^ arrival in Jedda as having necessarily been sent on a mission by His Majesty's Government, so much so that they officially denied it. Was one of the would-be peacemakers between 'Ali and Ibn Sa'ud in the last two months of 1924, but was „ repulsed, by Ibn baud. Appeared at one moment in 1925 to hover towards the ilasliimites, but had long believed in the star of Ibn Sa'ud, whom he visited near kj' i Mecca towards the end of the year and for whom he plumped finally, if indeed he p • had e\er really hesitated, after the fall of Jedda. Has since devoted himself to , the King s cause in the press, in his books and in every other way. Resided P r J* n Jeckia until 1930. Was prime mover, though not principal share- Li holder, in^SharqiehJLimited), whose business he directs in the Hejaz. Embraced ?%lii Islam m August 1930 and has since spent much time in Mecca, but was away from the Hejaz during most of 1932, when he effected an enterprising journey across the Hub a-al-Khali and then spent some months in England. Mr Philby has been variously judged and his influence in Arabian affairs variously estimated. He was for some time in and after 1924 a thorn in the ^ side 01 British authorities and was described in 1925 as clinging tenaciously to his religion, a simple dualism in which the spirit of darkness is represented f 11 %by His Majesty s Goieinment. Need now no longer be regarded as anti-British, except that he would still sympathise with Ibn Sa'ud in any quarrel with His Majesty's Government, and will still rail on occasion against the British Empire as a system. He would as soon sell British goods as Standard oil or Ford cars and he got Ibn Sa'ud's wireless contract for Marconi's in 1931. His influence wiih the King has been exaggerated by some into a legend, while many still believe him to be a British political agent. He has much access to the King and the King values his advice on certain occasions, but he presents no appearance of being in Ibn Sa'ud's confidence on major political occasions. He is still one of the King's greatest foreign admirers, but in the last two years has conceived doubts of Sa'udi administration, especially that part of it for which 'Abdullah Suleyman is responsible and doubts even of the King's capacity to direct his own machine. 77, Qattdn Family. (1) Yusuf ihn Salim Qattdn, said to have been originally a servant in a coffee -shop in Mecca and afterwards of the original Qattan family whose name le took. Became a guide for Javanese pilgrims. Rose to be president of the Mecca municipality under the Turks, but was still so uneducated that he was said to be unable to tell '' the letter Alif from a telegraph pole.' Became Minister of Public Works under King Huseyn. Was said in 1930 to be full of schemes connected with the pilgrimage and the advancement of his son No. (2) below. Has also come to notice as one of the agents concerned with the properties of the Sherifian family. (2) 'AhMs Qattdn, an ambitious young man of 30 odd, who was himself president of the municipality in Mecca in 1930 and still occupies that post He is the right-hand man of Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman, Minister of Finance, and is chief organiser of the hotels recently opened at Mecca, Jedda and Medina. 78, Qusaibi Family. An important merchant family in the Persian Gulf. The Legation is indebted to the Political Agent in Bahrain for an account of them, which was drawn up in June 1931, and of which the following is a summary . Said to be descended from a butcher of Riyadh. Composed of the five brothers mentioned below; children of the same mother by two brothers, Hasan aad Ibrahim, who married her successively; partners in business and property, engaged in trade between Bahrain their headquarters, Hasa and JNejcL Accounted, despite their acquisition of wealth, extreme y p e eian an disqualified by Arab custom from intermarriage with women of better birth.

He has of late employed ^nsta: other persons to buy for him, but he is not known to have deprived the Qusaibis of their general agency for him at Bahrain. ^ Cl$ 79. Rashid Family. ^{'Ab 1 Former rulers of Hail. Little is known of the remnants of this family once so powerful and later so fallen, even before its final collapse, that it was ' accounted infamous, even in such a land of violence as Arabia, for its record of domestic murders.' It deserves attention, however, because of the possibility Jifor of its reappearance on the scene, e.g., if the Shammar tribes from which it sprang should go against Ibn Sa'ud. It is understood that, after the fall of Hail, the ^ojSid King pursued a policy of absorption, not of annihilation and that many persons a ( belonging to the Beni Rashid, or connected with tnem, passed into his entourage. • ^ ^ Two lads who are being brought up with his younger children and are included in % ig( the list of his sons are said to be the children of a Rashid lady, whom Ibn Sa'ud married after their birth. Their names are— (1) Sultan and (2) Mish'al — star as I the latter of which corresponds with that of an infant child of the last ruling fasn ibn Rashid, as given in the 1917 volume of Personalities in Arabia. Two other .Prok persons have come to notice, who are said to be related to the Beni Rashid, viz.— iftiRiyi (3) Mansur ihn 'Asaf, who is said to have been taken into Ibn Sa'ud's service reduced and to have served for a term as Governor of Tebuk; and his brother— (4) Ndsir ibn 'Asaf, who also served Ibn Sa'ud, but was reported to have deserted into Transiordan in 1931. . • -i ■ As the information about this family is so meagre, it is worth noting that the following members of it accompanied Ibn Sa'ud from Riyadh to Jedda in March 1934: Muhammad ibn Talal, Mash'al ibn Mas'ud, Rashid al Miheysin, Sultan al Jabr and Fahd al Jabr. At least one Ibn Rashid accompanied the King's son, the Amir Feysal, to the Yemen front in April. m i nor o St in Sa'uc 80. Rifdda Family. Chiefs of the Billi tribe, with an urban establishment at Wejh. The most notable recent member of the family, Suleyman Afnan, played a not inconsiderable !:] role during the Great War, but was killed in a raid in 1916 and left two sons, Ibrahim and Ahmed. His brother Salim, who had died earlier, left a son, Hamid. The cousins in this generation were at enmity. Hamid made a bid for the Sheykhship on his uncle's death. He was one of several Hejazi Sheykhs who e ,o approached the Residency in Cairo in 1924, complaining both of King Huseyn's ^ 1 , 1 tyranny and his inability to protect them against the Wahhabis. He came into : ! greater prominence in 1928, when, having returned from Transjordan and taken ^ to brigandage, he attempted a coup at Wejh, hoping to dislodge his cousin Ibrahim, who was Governor there and head of the tribe. After a further period of exile he came into still greater prominence in 1932 by invading the Hejaz at ' ^ i the head of a rebel band. He and two, it was said, of his sons were killed, but there may be survivors of this branch. At the outset of the revolt Ibrahim visited the King at the head of a loyal delegation. He is still head of the Billi tribe in the Hejaz, but the Governor of Wejh is now Ibn Mubarak (see No. 65 a ). The family have attaches with a section of the Billi established in Egypt. Si tin Ql. Rushdi Malhas. -ttowi Editor of the Umm-al-Qura, the more important of the two weekly Jrecei newspapers published at Mecca and the unofficial organ of the Sa'udi Govern- jj^ ment. A Palestinian from Nablus, of whom little else is known to the Legation. 82. Rusheyd Pasha. Consul in Syria, stationed at Damascus. Aged well over 50. A native of Hail, said to be related to the Beni Rashid and to 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Zeyd (q.v). ^ Was semi-official representative of Ibn Rashid in Constantinople before the Great War. Said to have promoted Turkish efforts to curb the rise of Ibn Sa'ud at that time. Was attached during the Great War to Jemal Pasha in Syria, and was ,ittl e j s29 employed in Damascus where he showed bitter hostility to the Hashimites. Retired to Constantinople after the fall of Damascus. Eventually made his peace with Ibn Sa'ud and returned to Sa'udi Arabia. Was selected in 1931 to be the first Sa udi Charge d Affaires and consul-general at Bagdad, but has never proceeded, possioly because of difficulties over finance, aggravated by hostility on the part of 'Abdullah Suleyman. Showed signs about the end of 1932 of intending to leave for Bagdad overland, but is still in the Hejaz. P .S.—Appointed consul at Damascus, instead of Bagdad, in May 1933, and left Jedda for his post on the 24th May. 83. Sadiq (or Siddiq). The King's chauffeur. An Indian or of Indian origin. Born in the Bombay presidency; is about 36 years old; came with Ibn Sa'ud from Riyadh in 1925; had been in his service since about 1924. He was probably introduced to King by either the Qusaibis or al-Fadhls. Worthy of mention in this strange country, not only because he is said to be the only chauffeur the King will trust, but because he has been concerned in buying transactions, which have carried him at least once as far as London. Quite a clever fellow and said to have amassed some £20,000. Was recently reported to contemplate the creation of a canning industry at Wejh. Probably holds the speed record for Arabia, as he did the journey by car between Riyadh and Mecca in thirty-one hours a year or two ago, and is said to have reduced this recently to twenty odd. Some feat for a distance of about 600 miles over Arabian ' roads.' 84. Salih ibn 'Ahdul-Wahid. Governor of Qaf. Transferred from the Governorship of Al-'Ala to his present post in 1931. A man of no great standing, but of some importance as being the Sa'udi Governor nearest to the Transjordan frontier and not a nice neighbour by all accounts. Probably identical with man of the same name whose appointment as Ibn Sa'ud's representative with the Idrisi was announced in June 1927 and who played an important role in the Idrisi s entourage, e.g., at the time of the negotiations regarding the Red Sea Petroleum Company s concession m the Farsan Islands. 85. Salih Ibn Abu Bakr Shata. Aged about 45 to 50. Comes of a learned family in Mecca, where he was bom Much employed on committees for Waqfs, grain distribution, T c., Hashimite regime. Fled to Jedda after the Sa udi c JP^ l } ie ^ al of the Hejazi notables who compelled the abdication of King Huseyn t 1924 and rallied in due course to Ibn Sa'ud. Became one of ^ Amir Faysal in his capacity as Viceroy. Spoken of m 1930 as ^ PP s ® lb J® th of Education in a Cabinet then rumoured to be m contemplation,^ rumour was true, the project was not pursued. When e ^ , given the organised on its present lines early in 1932 and the Ami ^ i ^ is Ministry of the Interior, as well &lt; as others, Sah of it assistant in that Ministry and is still the adminis i a ive 86 ' itrSr name from the district of r ^ ^ jd He ^Vmo^ver!

Important in Mecca as the Keepership of the Key of the Ka'aba is hereditary in the family. The prerogative is very lucrative because all persons entering the Ka'aba are supposed to make a present to the Keeper according to their means. The family are admittedly descendants of the Quraysh tribe, but not of the Prophet. It is claimed that the pedigree is continuous from pre-Islamic times and that the right to keep the key also dates from that early period. According to one story, there was a blot on the escutcheon in the 19th century, when the male descent failed and the succession passed through a lady of the family who married a slave. The late Keeper's physical appearance suggested that this might be true, but there is no proof of it. Another branch of the family, claiming similar descent, formerly lived in Tunis, but now resides in Mecca. The present Keeper of the Key is— (1) Muhammad ash-Sha'ibi, an elderly man, probably the nephew of the late Keeper, who died in January last and whom this relative was appointed to succeed. The following two persons, who have come to notice in connexion with the activities of expatriated Hejazis against Ibn Sa'ud, are not improbably members of one or other branch of this family :— (2) M. Huseyn Sha'iba. —Accompanied Huseyn ad-Dabbagh {q.v.) on his visit to India in 1927. (3) Hasan Slntiiba. —Mentioned in reports from Aden as a Hejazi, who was in 1932 intimate with Huseyn ad-Dabbagh, and had been a school-master at Terim in Hadhramaut before coming from Mokalla to Aden in March 1932. If of sufficient age, he may possibly be identical with the man of the same name, who was a member for Mecca of the Turkish Parliament for some years, fled from Constantinople to Mecca in 1916, and at first supported but afterwards turned against King Huseyn. 88. Sherifian Family. Also called Hashimites by virtue of descent from the great-grandfather of the Prophet, but this name seems to be more particularly affected by the family of King Huseyn. There have been in the past and are in the present numerous families claiming this descent through one or other of the sons of 'Ali, the fourth Caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet. There are in Arabia itself many individuals bearing the title of Sherif, which is held to imply descent from Hasan, the elder son of ' Ali, and whole clans known collectively as Ashraf. The strains most conspicuous in the Hejaz trace this descent through an intermediate common ancestor Hasan ibn Abu Numey, who was Grand Sherif of Mecca in the latter part of the 16th century. Three groups of his descendants are accounted specially important, viz.— The Dhawi Zeyd, The Abadila, a particular branch of whom are the Dhawi 'Aun, and The Dhawi Barakat. All Grand Sherifs of Mecca in the 17th century were drawn from the rival Dhawi Zeyd and Dhawi 'Aun. The last Grand Sherif belonging to the former was 'Abdul-Mutallib, who held the post three times at long intervals. The majority belonged to the Dhawi 'Aun, of whom came the late King Huseyn and his sons. Although the most important members of the Sherifian family now live outside Sa'udi Arabia, their connexion with the Hejaz is so close as to justify this general notice. The following list, very incomplete, shows those who have come to notice in recent years :— (A) Dhdwi Zeyd. (1) 'Ali Haydar. —Now elderly. Formerly resided in Constantinople. Worked in with the Young Turks and was at one time Minister of Auqaf. Appointed Grand Sherif to supersede King Huseyn in or about 1917, but was naturally unable to assume the post effectively. Sought early in 1926 for British support in obtaining post of Regent or Governor of Hejaz under Ibn Sa'ud. Moved later that year to Beirut, where he still resides. Has several sons, the eldest of whom Abdul-Mejid is married to a daughter of his namesake, the31 ex-Caliph, and showed signs of political ambition after the Armistice. One of 'All Haydar s wives and the mother of two of his younger sons is of British birth Yet another son studied at St. Andrew's and had the distinction of acting as best man at the marriage of a fecotch divine at St. Giles' Cathedral. Civilised people important to keep m mmd though of no obvious political importance at present (2) J a far, brother of the above. Also lived in Constantinople. If alive, maybe identical with the elderly Sherif 'Ali Ja'far who lived at Lahei in 1932 and was described as a descendant of 'Abdul-Mutallib. (3) Sharaf ' Adndn Pasha at Ghdlib Formerly frequented both Constantinople and the Hejaz. Spoken of in 1925 as a possible ruler of the Hejaz, if Ibn Sa'ud won the war. Elected president of the Moslem Congress at Mecca in June 1926, and was later the vehicle of Ibn Sa'ud's refusal to hold another owing to attitude of the 'Ali brothers. Represented Ibn Sa'ud in 1927 at conference at Jizan to deal with the Red Sea Petroleum Company's concession in the Farsan Islands. Described in 1928 as 'grizzled and doddering.' Still resides in Mecca, but apparently a back number. (4) Sharaf Ridha, usually called Sherif Sharaf tout court. —Appointed Acting Minister of Finance under Ibn Sa'ud in January 1926. Resides in Mecca and is now a member of the Legislative Council. (5) Khdlid. —A nephew of the 'Ali Ja'far mentioned at (2). Implicated in the conspiracy against Ibn Sa'ud in 1932 and was active in and around Aden. (B) Dhdwi 'Ann. (6) 'AH ibn 'Abdullah. —Formerly Grand Sherif. Dismissed by the Turks in 1907. Resides in Egypt. Described in June 1932 as an active supporter of the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi. (7) 'Ali ibn Huseyn. —Ex-King of the Hejaz. Succeeded King Huseyn on his abdication in October 1924, but was compelled to abandon untenable position in Jedda in December 1925. Resides mostly at Bagdad. (8) Faisal ibn Huseyn. —King of 'Iraq. 9 'Abdullah ibn Huseyn.—Am\v of Transjordan. , ^ , (10) Zeyd ibn Huseyn.— Minister at Angora. Had a Turkish mother, a granddaughter of the well -known Grand V izier Reshid Pasha, and as property interests quite distinct from those of his brothers. All these, except perhaps (10), have issue. So had King Huseyn's brother Nasir, now deceased, who left six sons and four daughteis. (C) Dhdwi Barakat. (11) Sharaf ibn 'Abdul-Muhsin.—Seems to have served King Huseyn in Egypt, but entered the service of Ibn Sa'ud and became Director of Tribes. Appointed President 0 | tie n ^P p 0 . vn t but his present Departments in 1930. Recently returned to - ec j ca 11T ^pfstood to have been official status is not known, as the mspectora e abolished. (D) Apparently of the Abadila stock though not of the Dhdu' (12) SUUrihn Zeyd ihn Fawwaz.—Formerjy Gover^o^ T«f, ajost which seems to have been hered itary i n '' l ^ 1 ass o C iated with the Amir Control Board in Transjordan and ^'enemy of Ibn Sa'ud 'Abdullah, with whom he has thrown m his lot. A tenacious y and much less of a play-boy thal \ his Tf|-5 nrece ding —Lives quietly at Taif. (13) Hamud ibn Zeyd, brother of the Pf e .S® rt A a 3),_Said to have also (14) Sharaf ibn Rdjih, a cousin [-2, at Bagdad. Identified both in been Governor of Taif at one time. No Sharaf mentioned by Tahir Jerusalem and Bagdad as being e , . nt0 ^ hands of the Sa'udi ad-Dabbagh in February 1932, ^ ^ , e n K stec [ in the conspiracy against Ibn Government, as a man who might be enlisted m Sa'ud. (E) Even less easy to place, hut member of a family, two of (15) 'Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Ma ™ u l', n '7time and had great influence m the whom were prominent in King Huseyn s a h ing b |en one of the persons Harb tribe. This 'All has only come to notice32 arrested at Mecca and deported to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. (16) 'All ibn Huseyn al Harithi. —One of the Sherifs of Muda'iq, near Taif. Took part in the Arab revolt and is remembered as one of the conquerors of Damascus. Described by Colonel Lawrence as having been at that time an attractive young man, physically splendid and full of courage, resource and energy. Seems to have resettled in the Hejaz, as he was arrested at Mecca and deported to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. (17) Muhammad Mohanna. —One of the Jedda family, one member of which was Chief of the Controlling Department in 1917, and was then described as a ' bottle-nosed bandit,' while his brother, still alive, was said to have acquired wealth by smuggling and general robbery. This Muhammad is only interesting because he was arrested at Jedda and sent to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair. (18) and (19) M. 'All and Muhammad al-Bedeywi (a corruption of Bedawi). Members of a family distantly related to King Huseyn and formerly important in the Juheyna tribe and in the coast towns of the Northern Hejaz. Despite the similarity of name, they would appear to be two distinct, though closely related, persons. Both were mixed up in the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. M.'Ali became an object of attention in Transjordan and was more or less arrested in July to the displeasure of the 'Amir. Muhammad seems to have been in trade at Suez and Dhaba and was concerned in attempts to get supplies by sea to Ibn Rifada. It was probably he who was reported killed in the defeat of the rebels. 89. Suleymdn Shefiq Pasha Kemdly. Omitted, as he seems to have left Saudi Arabia for good. See Personalities report for 1933. 90. Suwayt Family. Leaders in the Dhafir tribe. Two members of it have figured in recent reports from Kuwait, viz.— (1) Ja'ddn, a disgruntled man, hovering between allegiance to King Faisal or to Ibn Sa'ud and too proud to come to terms with either; and (2) 'Ajemi, recognised as chief of the tribe by Ibn Sa'ud. 91. M. Taufiq Bey Sherif. Syrian ex-officer in Turkish army, of remoter Yemeni origin. At one time secretary to Ahmed as-Senusi. Later head of the divan of the ' Am ir Faysal at Mecca. Figured as an 'Asiri delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926, and was appointed Secretary-General after an election hotly contested by the 'Ali brothers, who complained that 'Asir was not, in fact, represented and that Ibn Sa'ud was packing the congress. Went to India later in that month to combat the 'Ali brothers and make propaganda for Ibn Sa'ud. Floated in and out of the Hejaz in subsequent years and had hopes of great preferment with a mandate to reorganise the administration. Had very variable relations with Ibn Sa'ud during this period. Finally broke with him so acutely that in June 1931 he decamped secretly in a pilgrim ship bound for India. The Sa'udi authorities accused him at that time of being concerned in a plot for circulating forged rupees on a large scale, but did not pursue the charge, which may have been trumped up. He later published violent attacks on the Sa'udi Administration. Has since ranged about in India and countries beyond the land frontier. Engages in trade as well as political adventure. Intelligent and active, but volatile; a superior type of adventurer, who might again make his peace with Ibn Sa'ud and play a role in this country. Closely associated in the past with Mahmud Nedim, former Turkish Vali of the Yemen, who seems to have gone to earth in Constan tinople in his old age, after a long and curious post-war career; and with Ismail Ghuznavi (q.v.). May still be in touch with the latter, despite his breach with Ibn Sa'ud. 92. Abu Tuqeyqa Family. Formerly chiefs of the Tihama, mainly Hejazi, section of the Huweytat tribe, with an urban connexion at Dhaba. Rafi'a, their common ancestor, was chief of iff i33 the tribe prior to his death in about 1870. One of his many grandsons, Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Rafi'a, was chief in 1917. He came to notice in 1924 as one of several Hejazi sheykhs who approached the Residency in Cairo with a complaint' of King Huseyn s tyranny and his inability to protect them against the fahhabis. He appears to have been Governor of Dhaba in 1927, but in that year the family were apparently in serious trouble with the Government, as it is said that Ahmed and four others were ' killed by Ibn Sa'ud,' and others fled to Egypt. Numerous members of the family were concerned in the rebel invasion of the Hejaz by Ibn Rifada in 1932. Seven of them lost their lives in that adventure and five more were reported by the Sa'udi commander to have been slain after Ibn Rifada's defeat. Among the survivors was, however— (1) Muhammad ihn [ ? ] ^4 hdurrahim ibn Alwdnihn Rafi'a, who was regarded as co -leader with Ibn Rifada. He escaped, and after many vicissitudes left 'Aqaba for Egypt early in October 1932. May be the person against whom an exclusion order was made in Egypt rather later, but whose name is given as Muhammad bin Ahmed. Another probable survivor is— (2) Mahmud ibn Ahmed ibn Rafi'a, who ratted on Ibn Rifada early in the rebellion and tried to make his peace with Ibn Sa'ud.• Although the above summary cannot be verified at all points, it is inserted in view of the obvious tenacity of the family hatred of Ibn Sa'ud, and the survival of (1), who seems to have been an active leader and may crop up again. 93. TurM ibn Madhi. Was in 1932 Inspector-General of 'Asir and was associated with Fahad ibn Zu'ayr in efforts to make Ibn Sa'ud realise the gravity of the situation preceding the open revolt of the Idrisi at the end of October. Identical wi ie person mis-named at the time 'Abdullah ibn Turki ibn Mahdi, who, wi u- Wahhab Abu Malha and two chiefs of Asiri tribes, was sent on a mission to tlie Imam Yahya in June 1927. Took part in further negotiations with the imam early in 1928. Would therefore appear to be one of Ibn Sa ud s experts in Asii and Yemen affairs, but no further information regarding him is a i available. 94. Weis, Leopold, alias M. A sadullah ' Vyce. yv eis, jueopooa, anas m. r An Austrian convert to Islam. Born at Lemberg in obscured by confusion at one time between him and a ^ erm r • r b e f or e name. Appears to have embraced Islam with numerous Ge , ri ?^ s ^ n Tb c * 1926, under the auspices of Dr. Jabbar Khair, who if roduced him to Ibn Sa ud.

Attacnea y ^ [10293] :'ti34 'Amman with whom he remained six months. Formed so low an opinion of the 'Amir that according to his own account he broke with Huseyn m consequence. Joined Ibn Sa'ud in due course. Came to Mecca in 1924-25 and started the Vmm-al-Qura newspaper. Figured as a Nejdi delegate at the Moslem Congress of June 1926. Remained editor of the Umm-al-Qura for some years, but was also official Director of Publicity. Took part in negotiations with bir Gr. Clayton m 1925 1927 and 1928. Acted as Minister for Foreign Ahairs m absence of Dr ' 'Abdullah Damluji in 1926 and 1927. Reported in 1928 to have worked to undermine influence both of Damluji, who resigned that year, and of Hafiz Wahba iq v) Employed in various negotiations and again acted at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, for Fuad Hamza early in 1931, and for the 'Amir Faysal and Fuad as well in 1932, but has for some years been principally important as a personal secretary to the King, who made him head of the political section of his diwan in 1930, and whom he always accompanies. Was notorious for his obstructiveness during the Clayton negotiations, and is naturally obstinate and hair-splitting in discussion, but can on occasion be amiable and even conciliatory. Takes his cue, in fact, from the King himself, to whom he appears to be genuinely devoted, and who probably trusts him as much as any of his near advisers except 'Abdullah Suleyman. Is probably a more convinced Wahhabi than most of the King's alien entourage and is also a strong Arab nationalist, with fewer ulterior motives than Fuad Hamza, having a simpler character and less European knowledge. Has the eyes of a fanatic. Works very hard. Though a very useful factotum to the King,' is rather a butt in high circles. A facile and sometimes intemperate writer, still responsible for contributions to the UiTim-Q/l-QuTd. Speaks only Arabic well, but can manage a little English. 97. Zawdwi Family. A Mecca family, worth mentioning because one of them, viz., Yusuf 'Ali az-Zawdwi appears to have been concerned at Cairo in 1932 in plots against Ibn Sa'ud; and because this or another Zawawi may have been in reality the person who went to France in the summer to buy arms for the conspirators. The man who went to buy the arms was first described as being Muhammad Pasha az-Zawi [szc], and was afterwards identified at Aden as being Hamid Pasha al-Wadi, then head of the Amir 'Abdullah's diwan. It is difficult to reconcile this with what is known of Hamid Pasha al-Wadi s movements about that time. Anyhow, whoever went to buy the arms, whether Zawi, Zawawi or Wadi, was associated with another person ' Abdul-Qadir Hamad ba-Hamid, and the names may have got mixed up. 98. 'Ahdul-Latif 'Ahdul-Jalii. Comes from Kuwait, where he held the post of Director of Customs, and was given the Indian title of Khan Bahadur. In 1930 or 1931, however, he vacated his post under a cloud. Has since moved about a good deal in Middle Eastern countries, including Sa'udi Arabia, and has attracted attention in Bagdad, Tehran and elsewhere by representing himself as empowered by Ibn Sa'ud to engage in purchases and to promote various schemes, e.g., an overland pilgrim route to Mecca, oil concessions, &amp;c. May have some general authority from Ibn Sa'ud for his activities, and is therefore worth mentioning, but he is not known in Sa'udi Arabia itself as a man of real influence or importance. 99. Hamad ibn Shuway'ir. Little is known of this man except that he appears to have played a role for some time in connexion with 'Asir and is now (May 1934) Governor of Tihamat 'Asir. In this capacity he has taken an important part in the present military operations in the coastal region of the Yemen. 100. Muhammad Surur as-Sabbdn. Administrator of the Finance Department. Son of a slave of the Sabban family and became the moving spirit in their hide and skin business, which was at one time important, but became latterly bankrupt. Was a clerk in the municipality under King Huseyn, and is said to have tried to assassinate Ibn} 35 , % ) i W ■■ ga 'ud when conquered the Hejaz in 1925, and to have been subsequently incarcerated at Riyadh. Returned to the Hejaz about 1929 and was taken up by the Minister of Finance, whose powerful influence got him appointed about two years ago to his present post. Is nowadays second only to him in the Ministry of Finance in practical importance, and during the latter's present (May 1934) absence at Hudeyda is in effective control of it. Manager of the recently-formed Arabian Export Company, a corporation formed to promote the export trade of the country. Pleasant, generous, and said to be most capable. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. ] &gt; V /7/7/w July 18, 1934. Section 3. [E 4624/2792/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 18.) (No. 204. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, July 2, 1934. YOU are aware that at various times during the past three years attention has been directed to the possibility of gold being discovered in the Hejaz in commercially exploitable quantities. Interest in the subject has been stimulated 3rincipally by the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitchell, a United States citizen, who las made several stays in the country, at first as an expert employed by the Saudi Government for various surveys, &amp;c., and later as a private person with commercial interests. In February of last year he was closely associated with Mr. Hamilton, the representative sent here by the Standard Oil Company of California to negotiate the Hasa Oil Concession, and it was understood at that time that he had interested one or more American concerns, whom he would himself represent, in other mining enterprises, and more particularly gold-mining (see, inter alia, paragraph 15 (c) of the Jedda report for February 1933). His earlier explorations had disclosed the existence of gold, though not necessarily in important quantities, in various places, notably the North-Western Hejaz, and two districts not far from Taif and Medina respectively. Some or all of these places are known historically as sources of gold in ancient times. 2. For some time after February 1933 little more was heard of gold. Nothing appears to have come of Mr. Twitchell's efforts to interest the Ameiican concerns more actively. Fie pursued his own activities, however, and the continued interest of the Saudi Government in the subject was demonstiated by the enquiry regarding gold-mining legislation in the British Empire, whic reported in my despatch No. 372 of the 20th December last. . 3 Mr Twitchell has now succeeded in obtaining the backing ot what appear to be important interests in the United Kingdom. He returned to Jedda on the 27th June as representative of the recently formed Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate (Limited),' which, it would appear from the registered in England as a private company with a capital of £20,00 - shares. I understand from Mr. Twitchell that the con 1 tr ° llm | ^ new concern is that of the Anglo-Oriental and Geneia , , -.j' £ of whose directors is on the board of the syndicate, but ^ ^J^Hnd firms the syndicate as a whole is unusually varied. Among ^e ^ P ^ /'Limited') interested are a Mr. McDermott and Messrs.

It may be worth adding that Mr. Iwitchell has acquired some interest in certain gold-mining propositions in the Sudan. In this area he is associated with Messrs. Foley, Bishop and Clark, who appear to have formed, or to be forming, a company to handle three propositions at places called (?) Wadi Aw, (?) Makraf, and a third of the name of which I am even less certain. They are not interested in the proposition at Oebeit, which is being handled by another British subject independently. 7.

Henderson.—{Received February 2) (No. 13.) * ' Sir, Jedda, January 12, 1931, WITH reference to Mr. Bond's despatch No. 25 of the 20th January, 1930, I have the honour to state that the anniversary of King Ibn Saud's accession was celebrated for the second time on the 8th and 9th of this month in accordance with a programme generally similar to that of last year and with equal pomp. On this occasion there was no delegation of the Egyptian press, but there was a sufficiency of journalists to provide for publicity and innumerable photographs were taken by all sorts of people. The most active press representative present was one Mahri Bey, an Arab of Mosul origin, who seems to have his headquarters at The Hague at present and whose main line appears to be the supply of European new T s to the papers of the Arab countries. 2. I had received your permission to attend the banquet, which I understood would be given by the Emir Feisal in Jedda on the evening of the 8th January, if I considered it politically desirable to be present, notAvithstanding the mourning ordered by His Majesty the King for the Princess Royal. I learnt later that there were to be four principal functions to which foreign representatives were invited. As the head of the only mission of first-class political importance here, I felt that any abstention on my part would be seriously misinterpreted in Jedda and Mecca, especially as I had had no previous opportunity of meeting the Emir Feisal, who now combines the functions of Minister for Foreign Affairs with those of Viceroy of the Hejaz. I therefore accepted the various invitations. C 511 ® the social functions projected, a tea-party at Kandara on the afternoon of the 8th, was in the event countermanded. Although no express reason was given, I was told privately by Fuad Bey Hamza that this change in the programme was intended as a mark of respect to the memory of the Princess Royal. I felt it all the more incumbent on me to attend the other functions. In my private letter thanking Fuad Bey and expressing satisfaction, I added that the gesture of the local authorities would be greatly appreciated in England, and explained that was interrupting a period of mourning for an event deeply felt at home m cider to be present at the various celebrations. 3 On the morning of the 8th January, my colleagues and 1 called on tne Acting Governor of Jedda. Early in the afternoon the Emir Feisal gave me a special interview, which had been arranged by iuad Bey. His Roya ig mess was very civil and very nervous. I cannot say that my first impression ot him was favourable. He has the hue features of his family and he does not show m his face the signs of dissipation which I expected. He lacks however both the charm and the physique of bis father and his elder brother, the , repose he wears a look of jaded melancholy and hstlessness an 11 ® ® , J?, agreeable, are sickly. In my own slight intercourse with him on the 8th and 9th January, he gave little evidence of keenness or mtelhgencB oug ; n ter- with his own entourage he seemed confident and qmc^ m ■ y . , prefer whom he employed at my private interview was 'l^pable^ 1 ^ intended to talk much business on such an occasion and, owing to the difficulty o u-ettiri'' anything of importance translated, I limited myself still further. enquired as to whether my letters to Fuad Hamza and the King m connexion with enquired as to wnetnei mv forwarded to Riadh and when they the proposed visit of Colonel B ^ coe that he had forwarded the letters, might be expected to arrive, ine rnnce sa Mv nnlv nthpr attemnt but hie; rpnlv in mv second question was hopelessly vague.

He ^ would appear to have been German trained, judging by his excellent knowledge fL. of German. During the last Syrian revolt he went over to the rebels and came to i this country as a fugitive from the French. The review afforded an opportunity ! A for displaying the meagre results so far achieved in the direction of creating a 1 ' regular army. The march past was headed by two detachments of infantry, ? about 500 men in all, rather ragged in formation but workmanlike and to some extent disciplined. Then followed a string of pack animals with various equip- f aI1 K ment and about 100 men in charge. Then came two armoured cars, which were 31lts0t followed by the 'cavalry,' consisting of less than forty horsemen, ill-mounted # rwaf ' and variously equipped, nothing more, in fact, than a disorderly rout of tribesmen, who indulged in wild shouts as they passed. The camelry, who came after them, were distinctly more impressive and numbered at least 320, perhaps more. This force, though also wild and composed of heterogeneous types, had a certain air of efficiency. Towards the end of the review T three aeroplanes of the Hejaz Air Force swept round in great circles, while the ' cavalry '' again appeared to display their prowess in galloping, firing comic pistols and emitting war cries. The aeroplanes did not venture to come low for fear of stampeding the camels. It had been intended that they should approach when the camelry went back to barracks, but the arrangements for this miscarried and as no signalling had been arranged the aerial display was rather tame. 5. The first day ended with a dinner of about 120 covers at Kandara. The Emir, who was to have presided, excused himself at the last moment on grounds of slight indisposition. Otherwise, the arrangements were excellent. Only two speeches were allowed. The first and more important consisted of a lengthy review of Ibn Saud's efforts in various directions. International relations were touched on and reference was made to tihe rapprochement with Iraq resulting from the meeting of the two Kings on board H.M.S. 'Lupin.' It was remarked that no mention was made of Egypt, an omission the more striking as it is understood that recent negotiations, though their scope and prospects of success have been exaggerated, have afforded promise of a better understanding between Egypt and the Hejaz. The Soviet Minister said a few words in Arabic at the end of dinner in reply to the references which had been made to the diplomatic representatives. 6. Mr. Hope-Gill and I started early on the 10th January for Wady Fatma to attend the celebration organised there by the municipality of Mecca. The programme was a heavy one. There were some twenty-four speeches, poems and set pieces recited by schoolboys, before and after luncheon. The Emir Feisal presided with hardly concealed boredom, though he was himself the object of the most eloquent eulogies. He was at his best with some children of the Royal family, including his own son, who flitted in and out of the reception tent. One of the items was a set piece welcoming the Prince and the foreign representatives, delivered in English by a Mecca schoolboy. His nervousness contrasted strongly with the aplomb of his comrades, who produced their Arabic effusions from lungs a br( ? nze '. anc i - e boggled sadly, poor child, over the hard word ' representatives.'' Another interesting school item was a case heard before the Cadi between 2^ vo ^ te ® P en a n d sword. The sword was very large and the pen very little. he Cadi, in a nicely-balanced judgment, declared them both to be servants, of equal utility as such, and reconciled the advocates in a handshake. One poet graceiully compared the Emir and the diplomatic representatives to the moon surrounded by stars. His comparison was apter than he knew, for our Minister oi roreign Affairs is a s^reat but pallid and elusive luminary and we, the stars, are very fixed m Jedda. The proceedings were punctuated by choral pertormances. Singing does not appear to rank as forbidden music, and one of the chants was introduced as the ' Song of the Fatherland.' At least 200 guests sat down to an excellent luncheon served at one long table in a marquee. The av en ed with a fantastic war dance by JNejdi tribesmen, a barbaric pantomime q V 5 1, an ^ J 0 l 0ur - At the outset the dance centred on a gigantic Royal standard, but before long standard and standard-bearer were dancW with the most active. 5 7 Not only had Egypt been ignored in the speech of the evening, but the Egyptian consul had been given a comparativelv poor place at table' These circumstances may account for his absence from the Wady Fatma party. Some o er ip omatic abstentions were due to indisposition and were less noticeable.3 8. I apologise for the length at which I have described these proceedings They are worthy of attention for various reasons. It was suggested last year that such a celebration was un-Islamic. The contrary view has triumphed fondly, no one present couM fail to be struck by the element of Saudian propa^ gaMa and the strong insistence on his successes as being great Arab achievements. Lastly, the element of compromise between Wahabi strictness and European ideas, which Mr. Bond noticed last year, was again definitely present The intervals for prayer were duly observed, but during the Prince's absence many members of his entourage strolled with us under the palms and smoked freely in our company. Although the music at the Wady Fatma party was all sung, the inhabitants ot the district used musical instruments undisturbed within earshot of us, nor was there any lack of drums in the war dance.

Sir, Jedda, March 6, 1931. IN my despatch No. 80 of to-day's date I have had occasion to mention the visit of Mr. Charles R. Crane to Jedda. As this event has attracted a good deal of attention, it may be worth while to make it the subject of a report. 2. It will be remembered that Mr. Crane visited Jedda at the end of 1926, as recorded in the Jedda report for December of that year. He did not then meet Ibn Saud, but they exchanged presents. His recent visit would appear to have been arranged by Mr. Antonius, who was formerly employed in the Palestine Administration, and who assisted Sir G. Clayton here at various times from 1925 to 1928. I first heard of it from Mr. Philby, shortly before I received a telegram from Sir John Chancellor on the subject. 3. Mr. Crane appears to have come specially from America to accomplish his personal visit to Ibn Saud . He arrived here on the 25th February and left on the 3rd March. He was accompanied by Mr. Antonius. He stayed, by his own request, at the house of a local notable who had entertained him in 1926. He saw a great deal of the King in one way or another, both by special arrangement and at functions. 4. In 1926-27 Mr. C rane was mal vu in French and British official circles because of his association with Syrian revolutionaries. I have no full information on the subject, but my French colleague here tells me that, in his opinion, the French authorities took a rather exaggerated view. He seems to regard Mr. Crane as an amiable busybody, who makes oriental peoples his hobby and who has money to burn, although he does not burn it as freely as he is sometimes expected to do. My own observation tends to confirm this. Mr. Crane called on me, and I entertained him a little during his stay without going beyond the courtesy which it is natural to show in this place to any distinguished vxsi or. He rode his hobby all the time, caracoling from Turkey to the Far East, and le seemed to be merely an interested, though sympathetic, observer of expeumen s m uplift in the various countries. He dwelt greatly on the many t nngs e a seen there from benevolent motives.

Before replying to this request the Turkish Government, having regard to the very friendly relations existing between themselves and us, desired to inform us of the request and to consult us about it. The Ambassador indicated that Turkey would not wish to act in the matter other wise than in accordance with our suggestion, though he made no promise to this effect. He observed that his Government, like ours, was sincerely anxious to promote peace in that part of the world in which we were both so closely interested.

It will be seen therefrom that on that oocasi n King Ibn Saud allowed certain Baniahs to return to t-f xor three months to settle their affairs, and also agreed to periodical visits to -.atif during the date season. -t is not quite clear whether this permission was limited to the two individuals whose case was then under consideration, namely, Katanmal son of Kanaymall and Haganmal son of Ohonamal, or was intended to apply to Hindu merchants in general.

Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon—{Received June 14.) [Enclosures not printed.] (No. 213.) Sir, Jedda, May 18, 1932. WITH reference to Sir A. Ryan's despatch No. 255 of the 3rd July last, regarding the proposed compendium of the constitutional laws of the world, I am at length in a position to furnish a reasonably comprehensive survey of the constitutional measures affecting the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies which have been promulgated since the establishment of the Saudian regime. 2. In his despatch No. 272 of the 20th October, 1929, Mr. Bond enclosed a translation of the Hejazi 1926 Constitution, or 'Organic Instructions' or 'Fundamental Rules,' as it is also sometimes styled. I have the honour to transmit herewith, marked 'A,' an amended translation which has now been made from an Arabic text of the Constitution communicated to this Legation by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. The first important change in the Constitution occurred on the 29th January, 1927, when the Sultanate of Nejd and its Dependencies was made a kingdom and was formally united with the Hejaz under Ibn Sand as King of the Heiaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies. A translation of the text of the Royal decree as published in the ' Umm-al-Qura of the 8th April, 1927, is attached marked ^ ^ -B.' 4. In June 1927 a Committee of Inspection and Improvement was constituted by Royal command. A translation of the .relevant extract from the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 1st July is attached, marked ' C.' 5 On the 9th July 1927, and on the recommendation of this committee, articles 28 to 31 of Part IV of the Constitution regarding the Legislative Assembly were modified. A translation of the amending regulation published in the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 15th July is attached, marked D. 6 In July 1928 this regulation was superseded by a similar regulation, which made no reference, however, to its predecessor, but only to Part iv o± the Constitution. A translation of the text of the new regulation as ^published i the ' Umm -al-Qura ' of the 13th July, 1928, is attached, marked K 7 An undated regulation conceiving the Directorate-General of Finance and referring- bv implication only, to articles 20 to 22 of the Constitution, was published in the Umm^al-Qura of the 21st September, 1928.

A translation was transmitted to you under cover of my despatch No. 36 of the 21st January. 12. There have certainly been many derogations in practice from the terms of the Constitution of 1926, and probably not a few modifications have been made constitutionally, and published in some form or another, but those enumerated above are all that can now be precisely traced, in the absence of any official gazette or other compendium, and with the assistance of the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs has stated in semi-official correspondence on the subject that Part IV of the Constitution has lapsed since the abolition of the post of Inspector-General, but he has been unable to indicate the date or exact nature of the modification. • I would refer in conclusion to the comment made on the status of Asir in paragraph 5 (b) of Sir A.
