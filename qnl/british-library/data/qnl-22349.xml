BJRLIN (i) On the 26th April the announcer made a statement rejecting President.Roosevelt 1 s 'interference' in European politicsi and attacking British policy in Palestine and India, and French policy in Syria.

In this particular case tne India Office have asked for a special telegraphic report on the reaction to German broadcasts in Arabic. It will however be useful for the India Office and the Government of India and myself to have regular reports on the effect of \rabic broadcasts from foreign stations on local public . . . opinion in your area. You already (vide paragraph 3(a) of my Chancery letter iio.3^8-3 of 22nd April 1939 to Cairo) report fortnigntly on tne local effect of B.B.c. broadcasts. You should now include in this report a section on the effect of foreign broadcasts. You can use for tnis purpose the same local organ ization, i.e. the Listeners Committee, as you have for tne B.B.C. broadcasts. 3.

Berlin. !• Usual news about Palestine. 2* Tne Jerusalem correspondent of tne Times, Lonaon, reports that tne Berlin ^rabic broadcast aiu not in the least interest the Arabs in Palestine. His message was on Monday whilest the Arabic broaucast from Berlin only began on iuescay. The broadcast has so annoyec the British that there is no wonaer we fine them in such confusion. Tiie Berlin Arabic broadcast has been opened witn tne purpose of telling tne wnole world wnat is really going on m tne Arabian countries and not as is shown tnrough British binculars. ^ A message irom Cairo says tnat tne French nave oliered tne district oi Aleppo in Syria to Turkey to^ induce her to join the democratic powers in case ol war. \ Italy . Hamc as No. 4 above with tne addition of the British and French instead of tne French, and also ''but Turkey is sympathetic with the Arabs'. 2. i T ucn resentment is felt in Egypt about the romours started by tne British, French and Jews in i ^gypt against Italy and Germany. Tne Egyptian paper 'Al-ilisri' says tnat we uave nothing against Italy and Germany for which we may be in enimity with them. Egypt has been asked by her ally before to make sacrifices which she did, and now she is being asked to sacriiice tne blood of ner youth in a war in wiiicn sne has no interest. Our friendship with Britain is not that of one Government with another but of one people and another. Egypt will not agree to plunge herself into the fire of a volcano in eruption. wtxier news irom Italy is about tne same as txiat of Germany. BagUao. / ^ 1 i 4 -r ; ; I v/&gt;' 'fS Jagndad broadcasts at tne same time as Italy arxi cannot be listener to.It appears that many people in Bahrain are pleased by the German Arabic broaacast because they seem to think that it champions the cause of the Arabs in Palestine, Syria ana elsewhere. The Italian broaacast, in spite of its show of sympathy towards Palestine ana Syria, is very unpopular because it is felt that it treats its listeners like chilaren by openly trying to play on their creaulity, ana by its many contradictory remarks and false news. ?.A : ' in •^adio rt ports lor Tiiursoa./ ana Friaay 4tli ana 5th May 1959.

It is addressed to the Political Agents for Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat and asks them to send him weekly summaries of any news items relating to their area, made in Arabic broadcasts by foreign radio stations.The file consists almost entirely of several English summaries of Arabic news broadcasts, transmitted to radio listeners in the Gulf States by European and Middle Eastern radio stations and expressing mainly anti-British views. Most summaries are from Berlin Radio and include news of Jewish immigration into British controlled Palestine and President Roosevelt’s peace telegram to Hitler on14 April 1939. There are also two short news summaries about Palestine from the British viewpoint, broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) Empire Service (known as Daventry Radio) in England.The reference number ‘1.a/25’ appears on two telegrams in the file (ff.17-18). This is a related file in the same series. There is also a cross-reference to a particular file part in a handwritten note on the file cover which says:‘Please see file 1.a/25-III for future correspondence’.
