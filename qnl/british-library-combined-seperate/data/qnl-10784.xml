The longer letter is a copy of a letter from the Political Resident to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Dated 24 April 1950, the letter recounts the Political Resident's recent visit to Sur, where he was accompanied by the Political Agent. The shorter letter, written on the same date, is addressed to the Political Agent; it requests details of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's revenue from Sur.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
