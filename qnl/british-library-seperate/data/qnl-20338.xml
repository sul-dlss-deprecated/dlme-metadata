It therefore requests instructions for guidance, particularly with regard to the circumstance where such assistance is limited solely to the recruitment of mercenaries from the island.The item has one enclosure, which itself attaches a further three enclosures; the principal enclosure is a letter from the Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf to Charles Augustus Murray, HM Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at the Court of Persia, at Tehran, dated Bushire 24 October 1855.The enclosure is forwarding a copy of an autograph note from the Imam of Muscat (no date) to the Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, along with a copy of his reply dated 22 October 1855. The Imam had requested an answer on the extent he could prosecute a war against Persia in the event their dispute over Bunder Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās] is not resolved. The reply explains that the Imam is free to adopt whatever measures he feels are required, but recommends that he awaits the outcome of British mediation with the Persian Government.The final enclosure is a translation of a letter from the British Agent at Muscat to the Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 9 October 1855. It informs him that the Imam intends to enquire as to whether he can seek assistance from Bussorah [Basra], or Bahrein in the event he is unable to reach a settlement with Persia. It also outlines some of the difficulties in negotiating the tribute due from Bunder Abbas.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000045#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
