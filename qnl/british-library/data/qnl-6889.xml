BIN SAUD is the hereditary ruler of the Wahabi State of Nejd (capital Er-Riadh). ai ly in the nineteenth century his ancestors, under the impetus of the Puritanical reli gious movement of which they were the champions, spread their power widely over the simomidin^' tribes and oases, and ruled for a moment from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. Later in the century they suffered adversity. Their power was broken by Mehemet Ali. 1 he hegemony of Central Arabia passed to the rival Bin Rashid house of Jebel Shammai (capital Hail), and in 1871 the Turks planted garrisons in the al-llasa province, along the Gulf Coast between Koweit and al-Katar. The Bin Saud powei was confined to the interior, and during this period there was practically no contact between it and His Majesty's Government. 1 he situation was radically altered, however, by two events in 1913. In May that year Abd-ul-Aziz Bin feaud, the reigning prince of that house, expelled the Turkish garrisons from Hasa and reoccupied the coast. And on the 29th July His Majesty's Government signed a Convention with I urkey, in which they recognised as belonging to the ' &lt; )t toman Sanjak of Nejd the coastline and interior west of a line drawn north and south from a point on the mainland opposite Zakhnuniyah Island (Gulf of Bahrein) to latitude 20° in the Ruba-al-Khali desert (Article 11). 1 Ins conjunction of events placed His Majesty's Government in a difficult position, k-unce Bin baud had become not merely the ruler of a section of the Gulf Coast, but the most powerful of all the local rulers, it was inevitable that His Majesty's Government should have direct relations with him over the arms traffic, British trade, and his dealings with neighbouring Arab States (Koweit, Katar, Trucial Chiefs, &amp;c.) already in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. On the other hand, Bin Sand's de facto independence in Hasa was not recognised by Turkey, and we had agreed with the 1 urkish Government to regard his coast and country as Turkish territory, and himself, by implication, as a Turkish subject. On the instructions of Sir P. Cox, at that time British Resident in the Persian Gulf, the British Residents at Koweit (Captain Shakespear) and Bahrein met Bin Saud on the 15th and 16th December, 1913. At this meeting Bin Saud invited His Majesty's Goyernment to keep the peace on his coast, showed the British representatives the draft agreement which the Turks were trying to make him accept, and practically asked for British mediation (6117/1990/14). The Turkish conditions communicated to us by Bin Saud were as follows ;— 1. The readmission of the Turkish garrisons to the province and coast of Hasa, as formerly. 2. The appointment of Kazis and other judicial officers by direct ' farmans ' issued by the Sultan. 3. The payment by Bin Saud of annual revenue of £T. 3,000. 4. The reference of all communications from foreign Powers or their representatives to the Turkish authorities for disposal. 5. The exclusion of all foreign merchants and agents from the province. 6. An undertaking from Bin Saud not to give concessions to any foreign companies for railways or motor-car services. On the 9th March, 1914, the Foreign Office presented a memorandum to Hakki Pasha, who was at that time conducting negotiations in London on behalf of the Turkish Government, in which the difficulty of His Majesty's Government's position in regard to Bin Saud was explained, the Turkish conditions cited (without the source of our information being stated), and a protest made against the last three of them (10569/14). In this memorandum British desiderata in regard to Bin Saud, subject, of course, to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, were defined as follows :— 1. That he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including Trucial Coast and Katar. [939] ' B -2. That, like other Sheikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf, he should co -operate for the observation and maintenance of the maritime truce, i.g., the suppression of piracy and the pursuit of inter-tribal hostilities by the passage of armed dhows at sea. 3. That he should co-operate for the suppression of the arms traffic. 4. That British traders should be freely admitted to Katif and properly treated while there. Meanwhile, negotiations between the Turks and Bin Sand proceeded, and resulted in a treaty signed by Bin Sand and the Vali of Basra on the 15th May, 1914 (236112/4650/16). The terms of this treaty may be summarised here :— Article 1.—Signatories' names ; secrecy ; validity. Article 2. —The vilayet of Nejd to remain in charge of Abd-ul-Aziz Pasha al-Saud for life. His descendants to succeed by Imperial firman, ' provided he remains loyal to the Imperial Government.' Article 3.—A ' technical military official ' (? euphemism for Turkish resident) to be appointed by Bin Sand, to live wherever he (Bin Sand) wishes. Turkish military instructors to be employed by Bin Saud at his discretion. • Article 4.—(Turkish) soldiers and gendarmerie to be posted, at Bin Saud's discretion, in sea ports. Article 5.—Customs, taxes, ports, lighthouses, to be administered by Bin Saud according to Ottoman regulations. Article 6.—Deficiency of local revenues to be met out of customs, ports, telegraphs and posts revenue. Any surplus in this imperial revenue, and 10 per cent, of any surplus in local revenues, to be remitted to Constantinople. Article 7.—Turkish flag to be flown on buildings and shipping. Article 8.—Correspondence 'ftgarding supply of arms to be conducted with Marine Department at Constantinople. Articled. —'The said Vali»And Commandant [i.e., Bin Saud) is not allowed to interfere with or correspond about foreign affairs and international treaties, or to grant concessions to foreigners.' Article 10.—Bin Saud to correspond direct with Ministries of Interior and Marine at Constantinople. Article 11.—Post offices to be established in vilavet of Neid. Stamps to be rp i • i * J J l lurkish. Article \'2. —In case of internal disturbance in Turkey, or war between Turkey and a foreign Power, ' if the Government asks the said Vali for a force to co-operate with its own forces, it is incumbent on the Vali to prepare a sufficient force with provisions and ammunition, and to respond to the demand at once, according to his power and ability.' During the course of these negotiations between Bin Saud and Turkey, and, in fact, during the whole period between the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, and the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey on the 31st October, 1914, His Majesty's Government discouraged Bin Saud's advances to them, and did their utmost to comply with the spirit of the Convention. During the interval between the beginning of the war in Europe and the inter vention of lurkey, when the attitude of the Turkish Government was becoming more and more hostile to the Allies, rumours reached His Majesty's Government that Bin Saud was preparing to throw in his lot with the Turks. The Turks did, in fact, attempt to reconcile Bin Saud and Bin Rashid, and secure their military co -operation on the 1 urkish side. But Bin Saud evaded these overtures (84042/46261/14 and 17000/1385/15 : No. 48). In October 1914 the Sheikh of Koweit wrote to him on his own initiative, stating that he proposed to stand by His Majesty's Government himself, and that he advised him to do the same (59746/46261/14). And Bin Saud wrote back that in the event of war with Turkey he would stand bv the Sheikh and the British Government' (63562/14). I he earlier rumours that Bin Saud was inclining towards the Turks, and the importance, in the event of war with Turkey, of securing his friendship, had ahea y decided the India Office to send Captain Shakespear, formerly British Resident at Koweit, on a special mission to Bin Saud (59038/46261/14). On the 4th October, 1914, th^e llesident in the Persian Gulf was instructed to inform Bin Saud of this intention through the Sheikh of Koweit; and on the 8th October, 1914, instructions were sent toGulf, he should co-operate for ime truce, i.e., the suppressiou lities by the passage of armed le arms traffic. ;o Katif and properly treated Saud proceeded, and resulted jra on the 15th May, 1914 marised here :— of Abd-ul-Aziz Pasha al-Saud , 14 provided he remains loyal lism for Turkish resident) to id) wishes.

The Turks did, in fact, ire their military co -operation ertures (84042/46261/14 and of Koweit wrote to him on his Majesty's Government himself, ' And Bin Saud wrote back &gt;y the Sheikh and the British towards the Turks, and the ir his friendship, had already formerly British Resident at i). On the 4th October, 1914, m Bin Saud of this intention L914, instructions were sent to * the Viceroy for a further communication (also to be made through Koweit) explaining His Majesty's Government's attitude towards Turkey, and asking Bin Saud to help them to keep the peace in Arabia in the event of Turkish aggression leading to war. Three Arabic letters were accordingly drafted at Koweit, one by the British Resident and the other two by the Sheikh (82216/14), in which Bin Saud was addressed in the sense of the India Office instructions and was informed of Captain Shakespear's mission. These letters were despatched on the 15th October, 1914. In answer to them, Bin Saud wrote letters on the 24th October, 1914, to the Political Resident in the Gulf and to Captain Shakespear himself. The letter to Captain Shakespear was conveyed through Bin Saud's lieutenant on the Hasa coast, and the latter was instructed to arrange a meeting for him with Captain Shakespear when that officer arrived (5353/1385/15). Meanwhile, on the 14th September, 1914, the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had submitted to the Government of India drafts of letters and notices to the ditferent Gulf Chiefs, which he had prepared for the event of war between Great Britain and Turkey, and which he proposed to issue upon the receipt of intelligence that war had broken out (64214/61439/14). The draft letter to Bin Saud (which was to follow a brief circular announcing that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Turkey) ran as follows :— ' In continuation of my previous letter, informing your Excellency of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey, I am authorised by my Government to request your Excellency to co-operate with our honoured friends, their Excellencies the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, in the capture of Basrah from the Turks or, should such a task be beyond your united powers, which seems unlikely, that you should make such arrangements, especially above Gurnan, as may prevent assistance reaching Basrah, until such time as the British arrive and take over the city. Consistently with your main object, viz., the captare or isolation of Basrah, we request youi Excellency to take all measures in your power to prevent the plundering of British merchants and property in the town of Basrah itself and in the neighbourhood. The personal safety of the Europeans should also be a special object of your solicitude. ' In return for this valuable co-operation, I am authorised by my Government to assure your Excellency that, in the event of our success—and succeed we shall, insha Allah—Basrah will never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority. ' I am further to assure your Excellency that the British Government will guarantee your Excellency— u 1. Against all reprisals by the Turks in consequence of these measures ; '2. Against attack by sea ; and ' 3. That they will be prepared to recognise your Kxcellency as independent Ruler of Nejd and al-Hasa, and to enter into treaty relations with your Excellency. ' I am also directed to request your Excellency to turn the 1 urkish garrisons of al-Hasa and al-Qatif out of your territory.' This draft was approved in due course by the Government of India and the India Office, and the letter seems to have been released for delivery on the 3rd November, 1914 (82713/61439/14 : pp. 7-8, 15-6, and 17). The three assurances contained in it became the basis of the subsequent negotiations. Bin Saud 's reply, dated the 28th November, 1914 (17000/1385/15: No. 46) was phrased as follows :— 'We have received your august communication dated the 3id ^November, 1914, in which you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has declared war'against the Ottoman Government, and that you ha,ve been ordered by the illustrious Govern ment to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Ruler o Koweit—our cordial friends and sincere allies—and attack Basrah. • • • • co-operation with the above -mentioned two friends is incumbent upon us (and so is it fdr us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, m a.l useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. \ ou should rest fully assured and be confident in this question.' 1 3 .iii one of the greatest helpers to the Grovemnient of Griedt Tiiitciin, hik ! she will, God willing, obtain satisfactory results, as we have mentioned to our mutual friend. Captain Shakespear. As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow a single one of them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation, and have turned them all out. 1 1 « But as to the following three matters mentioned by you, namely, the promise of the exalted Government to protect and safeguard us against the Ottoman Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection (to us) against any attack and hostility which may be made by sea, her recognition of the independence ot my chietship on all the parts of ^Nejd, al-IIasa, and C^atif, and the conclusion of treaties between us, (these) will depend on our arrival at Koweit. I am leaving my headquarters on this date and am bound for Koweit, and we will make the necessary verbal negotiations, in order that we may earn the approval of our friend, the Government of Great Britain.' No further steps were taken on the British side till Captain Shakespear, travelling vi4 Bahrein and Koweit, reached Bin Sand's camp on the 31st December, 1914 (30472/1385/15 ; No. 2). During the next few days he discussed exhaustively with Bin Sand the latter's relations with Great Britain and Turkey since their previous meeting a year before. Bin Saud referred to the various messages he had received from representatives of Great Britain during the past three months, and dwelt especially upon the letter of the 3rd November, 1914, from the Officiating Resident in the Gulf. He cited the three assurances contained in it, but remarked that— ' the document was a vague letter, did not specify whether the assurances were limited merely to the present war or also included the future, gave no hint whether other conditions would be required of himself later, and could not be regarded as a binding instrument between the two parties for the future.' Captain Shakespear concluded from these conversations that Bin Saud— ' had no intention of abandoning his neutral position, with freedom to make his own arrangements with the Turks (and he was confident that he could secure from them a very good 'second best') until he held a signed and sealed treaty with the British Government; nor would he move a step further towards making matters either easier for us or more difficult for the Turks so far as the present war was concerned, until he obtained in that treaty some very solid guarantee of his position, with Great Britain practically as his suzerain.' Captain bhakespear therefore asked Bin Saud to draw up *'a preliminary draft, containing what he was prepared to accept and what he desired,' which he (Captain Shakespear) might then forward to His Majesty's Government for their consideration. Ihis suggestion wa§ promptly carried out by Bin Saud, and in a report, dated the 4th January, 1915, to Sir P. Cox (in which the foregoing conversations were also put on record) Captain fehakespear submitted a rough translation of Bin Sand's desiderata :— Ihe clauses which will be reasons for a binding agreement between myself (' Bin Saud ) and the Great British Government;— 1. That the British ( jovernment will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, al-Hasa, Qatif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of m\ fathers and forefathers ; that I am the independent ruler of them, and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above-mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there ls no (right of) interference to any foreign Power. 2. ihat they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory's) boundaries north, south, east, and west, by land and by sea, and that (^g^ding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, w ich au* either under British protection or (directly) under British government, if there should arise differences between me and the c le s of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, e} s lould be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors. r5 3. That all existing jurisdiction in all my territories shall continue in accordance with the laws of the sacred Mohammedan Shariat, according to the sect of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanhal-as-Salafi, and all who dwell therein shall be subject to them in all matters or (shall be subject) to the customary law of the towns in which they may be, whether my own subjects or the subjects of States adjacent to my territories—by reason of religious obligation we are helpless without it nor can we exceed it. ' 4. There shall be no permission to any foreigner to acquire a hand's-breadth of my territories (within the defined) boundaries, not even by a substitute, except after reference to myself and with my permission. ' 5. After acknowledgment erf the above clauKes, that she (Great Britain) will promise to prevent and to defend from all oppression and aggression which may come upon or happen to my territories by land or by sea, from whatever Power it may be. 6. That she (Great Britain) will promise that she will not permit nor encourage nor accord sanctuary to accused persons or fugitives from our territories, whether townsmen or nomads. ' 7. That she (Great Britain) will respect and protect the rights of my subjects, and deal with them as she deals with her own subjects while they may be (resident) in her territories and dependencies. '8. If she (Great Britain) accepts and acknowledges the foregoing clauses, then I accept and acknowledge severance of dealings with any other Power in all (matters of) concessions, interference, and intercourse^ except with reference to the Great British Government. 44 9. I bind myself to protect trade within my territories from all aggression, and that I will deal (with her subjects) according to the treatment my own subjects receive in all matters of government and business in her (Great Britain's) countries and dependencies. '10. T bind myself to the protection (in) the coasts and ports which are under my Government from all aggression to the subjects of the British Government and those under their protection. '11. I will forbid the traffic in arms and ammunition, whether by a Govern ment or by (way of) merchandise, from all the ports which are under my Government, on condition that if I should be in need of anything in arms and ammunition I will refer to the British Government in order to obtain my wants.' In forwarding this document. Captain Shakespear added some observations of his own, which have still, after four years, an important bearing on the eventual settlement of our permanent relations with Bin Sand after the war:— # 'I venture to submit that Bin Sand, in effect, asks for little more than*what has been already conveyed in the Acting Resident's assurances, if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis, and if they are interpreted liberally and generously. In exchange. Bin Saud offers to make himself a British vassal for good. The addition to our responsibilities does not appear heavy :— '(a.) The Turkish menaces from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Bin Saud, need give us no anxiety—we have no reason to suppose they will be more successful in the future than thej have been within the last two or three decades, while, guaranteed from attack by sea. Bin Saud will be in a far better position to meet them than was possible hitherto. Should they become threatening, strong diplomatic representations would probably suffice to prevent any attempt on a scale with which Bin Saud could not cope himself. ' (?&gt;.) We should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between the Arab Sheikhs along the coast and Bin Saud, a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. • Three weeks later, on the 24th January, 1915, Captain Shakespear was killed in a battle between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid, at which he had insisted on being present. No blame attaches to Bin Sami fur this lamentable event. [939] C6 ' On the other hand, the advantages seem to be considerable ;— ' (a.) Complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. {b.) Similar complete control of the arms traffic. '(c.) The practical exclusion of foreign Powers and influence in Central Arabia. ' [d.) The security induced by British suzerainty and 'Bin Sands' strong control of the Bedouin tribes will give a great impetus to trade through the Persian Gulf ports, probably diverting a share of what now passes through the Red Sea ports. (&lt;?.) The great influence Bin Saud ha»s over Mohammedan opinion in Arabia, an influence likely to increase as the Turkish Empire breaks up and the Khalifate of the Sultan is questioned, will be a British asset. (/.) Bin Sand's influence with all Arab tribes, and particularly with the Northern Anazah, with whom our occupation of Lower Mesopotamia will bring us in close contact. Upon receipt of Captain Shakespear's report, Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 16th January, 1915, to the Government of India (17000/1385/15 : No. 49) a summary of Bin Saud's desiderata, and made the following further suggestions:— ' Bin Saud should undertake :— 'First. —To receive representative of British Government either at his capital or sea-port or both, if desired. 'Secondly, —To agree (to) extra-territoriality for our non-Mohammedan subjects. 'Thirdly. —To abstain from waging war by sea without our consent, and to co-operate for the suppression of piracy. ' Fourtldy. —To protect pilgrim traffic passing through his territory. ' Fifthly. —To levy customs dues at rates which we consider reasonable, having regard to rate prevailing at Bahrein and Koweit. ' Sixthly. —To allow British merchant vessels to visit his ports. ' Seventhly. —To agree to locate post office and possibly telegraph office at his port when the time comes.' 'I do not include any item regarding slave trade, as that is not now a serious difficulty, and has given us no trouble at Koweit. Only point regarding which it seems necessary to offer c^nment here is the question of protection against external aggression by land. w ^hen we invited Bin Saud to move on Basrah, we undertook to protect him against reprisals by Turks, so that, as far as latter are concerned, what Bin Saud now asks us to give does not amount to much more. Apart from Turks, Central Arabia is practically inaccessible by land to any Power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to (the) reservation that aggression be unprovoked. We have publicly declared that our object is to effect liberation of Arabs from oppressive yoke (of) Turkey. In this case there is no question of annexation of territory to which our allies could take exception, while Bin Sand's weight in scale would be no mean asset to joint cause of us all. Can I possibly be authorised to draft a treaty on above lines for negotiation by Captain Shakespear ? I shall not now have the opportunity of meeting Bin Saud myself. am obliged to give Bin Saud some reply by his messenger, who has orders to return at once. I am sending Captain Shakespear purport of above additional pomts and asking him to use his discretion in discussing them with Bin Saud. To -&gt;in &gt; aud I am replying that I hope that an instrument safeguarding his position can )e arrived at somewhat on lines indicated, and that I have telegraphed to overnment on subject, but that treaty must necessarily take a little time to aqq 1 /! ja 1 nuar y» 1915, after further correspondence with Sir P. ^ oX &lt; 11837/1385^S) a Vicero y telegraphed to the India Office as follows runri., settlement, Bin Saud has himself submitted memo- m se irig orth tentatively his proposals for formulation of treaty. Theseinclude many matters of detail, fraught with difficulty and requiring ripe con sideration—for instance, definition of boundaries, law and jurisdiction, harbouring of refugees, reciprocal treatment of subjects, arms traffic, and arras facilities. 'We consider early conclusion of treaty with Bin Saud most important, but that, for the present, it should be on broad lines somewhat similar to the original Afghanistan agreement with Abdur Rahman, and suggest following :— ' 1. British Government recognises Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, llasa, and Katif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty, subject to the acceptance of successors by tribesmen and approval of His Majesty's Government; ' 2. In the event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any foreign Power, British Government are prepared to aid Bin Saud to such extent and in such manner as the situation may require ; ' 3. In return. Bin Saud agrees to have no dealings with any other foreign Power, nor grant concessions to subjects of any other foreign Power, except on the advice of the British Government, which advice he will unreservedly follow; ' 4. British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude, as soon as this can be arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters jointly concerning them. ' Cox agrees that a preliminary treaty on these lines would meet the case, and thinks Bin Saud would accept it. Dynastic guarantee of some kind would probably be essential.* That proposed appears sufficiently guarded.' On the 30th January, 1915, the India Office communicated this telegram to the Foreign Office with the following observations (11837/1385/15):— ' The desirability of concluding a treaty with Amir Abdul Aziz follows not merely from the exigencies of the moment, which make it necessary to pay an immediate price for his friendship, but also from the general situation that will be created in the Persian Gulf in the event, as the result of the present war, of the disappearance of Turkish rule from Basra, to which His Majesty's Government are pledged. It may be anticipated that the Amir of Nejd will be left the master not only of Central Arabia, but also of a long strip of the coast, and in the interest of peace and order it will be essential for the Power that controls the Gulf to have a working arrangement with him. The extent, therefore, to which his claims must be met must be measured not only by the immediate services which he is expected to render, but also by the potential power for mischief whioh, in the event of success, he will possess, and if permanently estranged will doubtless exercise. ' As regards the terms of the treaty suggested by the Government of India, the dynastic pledge is undoubtedly the crux, but safeguarded in the manner proposed it appears to be free from reasonable objection. It is, however, more than probable that the condition that the successor must be accepted by the tribesmen will be a stumbling-block to Bin baud, as it was to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in whose case His Majesty's Government, under the pressure of the war, have recently approved its abolition. Moreover, regard being had to the very large area over which Bin Saud is to rule and the notoriously factious temper of the Arabs, it may be very difficult to fulHl in practice. We must therefore be prepared for opposition from Bin Saud, and the Marquess of Crewe would not let the negotiations break down over this point. _ . i i • » ' The guarantee against unprovoked aggression should, in his Lordship s opinion, be so worded as to make His Majesty's Government sole judges of the nature and extent of the assistance to be given. 44 Subject to these remarks Lord Crewe commends the proposals of the Government of India to Sir E. Grey's favourable consideration. It is a question whether, in view of the importance of our eventual relations with Bin Saud, the present treaty should not contain a clause binding him (subject to an agreemenr as to boundaries in the detailed treaty to be concluded later) to abstain from ^ter- ference with Koweit, Bahrein, al-Katar, and the Trucial Chiefs. His Lordship would propose to suggest this to the Government of India, but to leave it to their discretion. * The Turks had given Bin Saud a dynastic guarantee in their Treaty of the 15th May, 1914,8 On the 1st February, 1915, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, instructed the Viceroy, in the sense of the above letter, as follows (11837/15 ; 14168/15) ' Your proposals are approved subject to following lein.irks . ' 1 In dynastic guarantee condition of acceptance of tribesmen should be secured if possible, but you will remember difficulty which this caused in case of Mohammerah, and negotiations should not be allowed to break down over this point. ' 2. You are presumably prepared for Sheikh of Koweit to ask for similar guarantee when both Bin Saud and Sheikh of Mohammerah have it. ' 3. Pledge ao-ainst unprovoked aggression should be so worded as to make His^ Majesty's Government sole judges of nature and extent of assistance. '4. Please consider whether this treaty should not contain clause binding Bin Saud, subject to eventual definition of boundaries, not to interfere with Koweit, Bahrein, al Katar, and Trucial Chiefs. But I leave this to your discretion/' On the 6th February, 1915, the Government of India communicated these instructions to Sir P. Cox (30472/15 : No. 6), and authorised him to enter into negotiations with Bin Saud on the lines laid down, ' on the clear understanding ^that anv r.reaty agreed upon is subject to the confirmation of the Government of India.' Accordingly, Sir P. Cox drafted a treaty in seven articles, the terms of which (see 111069/15) may be summarised at this point:— Article 1.—His Majesty's Government recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, al Hasa, Qatif, and their ports on the Gulf Coast, and his descendants after him, ' but the selection of the individual shall be subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government.' Article 2.—His Majesty's Government shall aid Bin Saud at their discretion in case of unprovoked aggression against him by a foreign Power. Article 3.-^Bin Saud renounces diplomatic relations with any foreign Power other than His Majesty's Government. Article 4.—Bin Saud will not cede, sell, or mortgage territory, or grant concessions to any foreign Power or its subjects, without the consent of His Majesty's Government Article 5.—Bin Saud will keep open the pilgrimage routes through his territory to the Holy Places, and will protect pilgrims. Article 6.—Bin Saud will refrain from interference with Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Oman Coast, and any other tribes and chiefs under His Majesty's Government's protection. Article 7.—A further detailed treaty shall be concluded later. About the same time (43530/15: No. 14) Bin Saud wrote to Sir P. Cox, asking, in view of Captain Shakespear's death, either that another officer should be deputed, or that negotiations should be continued by correspondence direct from Basra, and not viS, Koweit. On the 24th February, 1915, in reporting this request to the Government of India, Sir P. Cox made the following proposal ;— ' I would propose now to send him draft treaty which was awaiting despatch through Shakespear, together with Viceroy's letter. In doing so 1 would advise him to sign it without delay, and say that, as soon as it is completed, an officer can then be deputed to discuss details of second treaty.' The Government of India instructed Sir P. Cox to act as he proposed, and on the 28th February, 1915, this was reported by the Viceroy to the India Office (24119/15). Sir P. Cox s draft and the Viceroy's letter were accordingly forwarded to Bin Saud, and two letters, both dated the 24th April, 1915, and addressed respectively to the Viceroy and fc»ir P. Cox, were eventually received in reply from Bin Saud (111069/15). In his letter to Sir P. Cox, Bin Saud enclosed a signed copy oi the Arabic version of the treaty. But, to quote his words— &lt; ertain modifications (which are not important) were found necessary for cogent reasons, necessitated by local conditions, the need to reassure the inhabi-tants and the governing family of Bin Saud, and also in view of the knowledge we possess as to the circumstances of the Arabs.' Sir Percy Cox replied to Bin Saud as follows in a letter dated the -iGth June, 1915 As regards the treaty, i have understood what you wrote, explaining that you had made certain modifications in the text. I have not the least doubt that we shall succeed in adjusting the wording of the articles into a form which will suit both parties and safeguard the interests of yourself and us ; but, as the wording was different to what the Government had approved previously, it has been necessary for me to refer it to them.' On the same date he forwarded to the Government of India translations of his own and Bin Sand's drafts in parallel columns, adding a schedule of Bin Sand's alterations, and commenting upon them. It may be convenient to set out the two versions in this memorandum :— British draft. Bin Saud's draft. In the name of (rod the Merciful and In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.

Cox suggests 4 where his interests are not injured thereby,' and this seems unobjectionable. Cox proposes to arrange a meeting shortly with Bin Saud to adjust differences. W e think lie should be authorised to do so, and to negotiate a treaty on lines above indicated, subject to ratification by Government of India. On the 11th August, 1915, the India Office communicated to the Foreign Office copies of this telegram and of the documents received from Sir P. Cox, and submitted a draft telegram of instructions to the Viceroy. In their covering letter explaining the grounds of the instructions proposed in this draft, the India Office laid particular stress upon Bin Saud s omission of the words ' subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government,' at the end of article 1 :— ' It is ordinarily the policy of His Majesty's Government to recognise only the de facto ruler, and to avoid giving dynastic guarantees; and the rare exceptions which they have made have been in cases—such as that of Mohammerah—where their relations with the ruler have been of long standing, and where the responsi bilities undertaken are limited. Neither of these conditions is present in the case of Bin baud, and Mr. Chamberlain therefore hopes that Sir P. Cox may be able to obtain the restoration of the words. Those which Bin Saud proposes to substitute are apparently intended to provide for the constitutional election of a successor in a case where the ruler has failed to designate during his lifetime. There seems to be no objection to such a provision, so long as the method of election is practicable, but it does not appear how in such a case His Majesty's Government are to ensure that only a person agreeable to themselves shall be elected. Since, however, a person elected by a tribal majority would probably have no difficulty in maintaining limscflf as de facto ruler, if the election had been conducted by a method recognised by the tribes themselves to be valid, undesirable complications are perhaps unlikely to arise. ' Ihe draft was concurred in by the Foreign Office, and the following telegram was accordingly despatched by the India Office to the Viceroy on the 16th August, 1915 (111069/15 and 116544/15):— ' Article 1 of treaty. Cox, after suitable explanation, should press for resto ration of original words, to which His Majesty's Government attach great importance. There seems no objection to election 1 ' in default of designation, pro vided method of election is practicable and recognised as valid according to Arab custom by all tribes concerned. Otherwise we may become involved in inter-tribal disputes. Article 2. ' Unprovoked ' should be restored. His Majesty's Government do not like leaving ambiguity as to their aid, and if Bin Saud will not agree to original words they would prefer ' to such extent and in such manner as British Government after consultation with Bin Saud may consider most effective for protecting his interests.' ' Article 4. Cox should secure omission of Bin Saud's addition if possible; if not, substitution of his own proposal. ' As regards other alterations he should exercise his discretion.' On the 18th August, 1915, the Government of India communicated the telegraphic correspondence that had passed between the Viceroy and the India Office to Sir P. Cox, and authorised him (141285/15) to arrange a meeting with Bin Saud, as he might think advisable, and negotiate further on these lines, on the understanding that a treaty, if concluded, would be subject to ratification by the Government of India. Accordingly, Sir P. Cox resumed negotiations, and concluded a definite treaty with Bin Saud, on the 26th December, 1915 (201630/15). In a letter dated the 3rd January, 1916 (38086/4650/16), he forwarded to the Government of India a translation of the treaty as signed, and also 'set out the text of this and of the original British draft (both in translation) in parallel columns, with the alterations marked, and with comments on each alteration, explaining how it arose and * For the words in the British draft of article 1 which the Viceroy quoted in his telegram of the 7th. July, 1915, Bin Saud had substituted 'by the living ruler or by calling for the votes of the subjects inhabiting those countries.'12 what its effect would be. A copy of the text signed on this occasion, and subsequently ratified is printed at the end of the present memorandum, and the passages that differ from the original draft (printed on pp. 9-10 above) are there done into italics. Copies of this text, and of Sir P. Cox's comments were transmitted by letter to the India Office on the 21st January, 1916, and on the 8th February. 1916, the \ iceroy telegraphed to the India Office (26095/16) that the Government of India proposed to ratify the treaty in this form if the India Office saw no objection This proposal was approved by the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office in a telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 6th March, 1916 (40708/15 and 67554/15). On the 10th March, 1916, the Government of India wrote accordingly to Sir P Cox (71652/16), returning him the two original copies of the treaty signed by himself and Bin Saud, and attaching parchment copies of the English translation, with instructions that the Arabic version should be written m on the margin of these, and that they should then likewise be signed by Sir P. ( ox and Bin Saud. These instructions appear to have been carried out, and the parchment copies returned in due course to India. The treaty was eventually ratified by the Government of India on the 18th July, 1916 (174647/16). tx - ™ ^ i i Shortly after this, Sherif Husein, with whom His Majesty s Government had entered into relations in the latter part of 1915, wrote to Bin Saud asking for ' alliance ' and ' assistance ;' and Bin Saud reported this to Sir P. Cox, recalling former aggressions by the Sherif on his (Bin Saud's) territories and tribes, and expressing mistrust of the Sherit's intentions. (See Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, Section (vii)). In view of this, Sir P. Cox submitted on the 8th September, 1916, that Bin Saud should be informed definitely that no present or future understandings between us and the Sherif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles 1 and 2 of our treaty with him of the 26th December, 1915.' And he also suggested that the terms of this treaty might be communicated to the Sherif (180581/16). In regard to the first of these proposals, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office (183325/16), telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 19th September, 1916 (191509/16), informing him that 'as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or Confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,' and instructing him that 'reference to the treaty should be confined to Article 1, as we could not admit that Article 2 was binding on us as against other Arabs.' These instructions appear to have been carried out by Sir P. Cox in the form of a verbal assurance to Bin Saud on the occasion of durbar held at Koweit on the 21st November, 1916, at which Bin Saud was decorated by him with the K.C.LE. in the presence of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah (235981/16 and 236884/16). The terms of the treaty of the 26th December, 1915, were also communicated to King Husein in due course (see Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein, Section (vii)), in accordance with Sir P. Cox's suggestion. Relation of Commitments to Bin Saud to British Desiderata. In considering the bearing of this treaty with Bin Saud upon British desiderata, it has to be remembered that it was intentionally confined to immediate essentials ; that important questions like the regulation of the arms traffic and the status of British nationals in Bin Saud's territory (brought up by Bin Saud himself), or, again, the binding over of Bin Saud to keep the peace at sea in the Gulf (brought up by Sir P. Cox) were postponed for later consideration by the consensus of the Government of India and the India Office; that article 7 provides for the conclusion of a detailed treaty hereafter ; and that Bin Saud rather than His Majesty's Government has pressed that this should be carried out at an early date. In examining the present treaty, therefore, little account need be taken ot omissions. Yet it may be pointed out that, even as the treaty stands, it contains all the elements of a true trucial treaty. These elements are (a) the right and obligation of His Majesty.'s Government to arbitrate in case of disputes between the other party to the treaty and bis neighbours, who are bound by similar treaties to His Majesty s Government; (b) t le renunciation by the other party of any relations with foreign Powers except through His Majesty's Government; and (c) a promise on the part of the other party not to alienate territory to a foreign Power except with His Majesty's Government's consent. Of these essential elements, (6) and (c) are explicitly embodied in articles 3 and 4 respectively ; while (a), thougli nowhere set out in terms, would appear to be covered satisfactorily by article 2 and the last clause in article 4.13 tus treaty, therefore, although it was never intended to be exhaustive is or* sounder lines than our treaty with the Idrisi or our more informal arrangements with King Husein, and t:iere ought to be considerably less difficulty in expanding it when the tune comes into a definitive treaty settling our relations with Bin Saud in detail. + , i are, however, several positive points affecting British desiderata to which the piesent treaty appears to commit us:— (1.)— Demarcation of Territories. 1 ^ e . recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of certain enumerated mined 'hereafter ' p ericles and territories, which will be discussed and deter- 1 h's is less explicit than our undertaking to the Idrisi (article e of Idrisi Treaty, lor which see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Idrisi), in which we under- take at the conclusion of the war to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi oaiyul ana the Imam Yahya, or any other rival.' But in effect it commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between ni baud and King Husein, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award. (2.)— Keeping of the Peace. In the original trucial treaties with the Independent Chiefs of ' Trucial Oman,' His Majesty s Government's rights and obligations were strictly limited to the main tenance of peace at sea, and we did not attempt to control the mutual relations on land of the Arab parties to this series of treaties. This formula set a very desirable limit to His Majesty's Government's liabilities, while covering most of the causes of strife between the local Arab rulers. The trucial chiefs of Oman hold sway in a narrow strip of territory between the sea and an uninhabited desert. I he activities of their subjects are almost wholly maritime, and there are no nomadic tribes in their area of jurisdiction to create difficulties of allegiance and demarcation. But it is evident that if the British trucial system, hitherto confined to the fringe between the south and east coasts and the great south-eastern desert, is to be extended, as it has been extended during the war, to the remainder of the Peninsula, we shall have to keep the peace between rulers whose prosperity depends, not upon the coasting trade or the pearl fisheries, but upon the command of inland oases and Bedouin tribes. Bin baud, the Idrisi, and King Husein, with whom we have entered into relations during the war, are rulers of this latter kind. A &lt;( Pax Britannica' in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, valuable and indeed indispensable as it is, will do comparatively little to remove the causes of friction between them, or to enable His Majesty 's Government to deal effectively with such friction when it arises. If we are to keep the peace between them, we shall be driven eventually to control their relations with one another by land. To a certain extent this may be done by a maritime blockade. But apart from the fact that, where political authority is as lax as it is in Arabia, it is difficult to blockade one State effectively without blockading the whole Peninsula,* it is in the nature of things more difficult to bring pressure to bear on Hail or Er-Riadh by this method than on Sharjah, or even Maskat. Besides this, our new Arab Allies are considerably more powerful than most of the Arab rulers who have previously entered into a trucial relationship with us. And in the case of King ' Husein, who is likely to be the most troublesome of all over his relations with his neighbours, it is peculiarly difficult for His Majesty's Government to exert pressure, whether by blockade or otherwise, owing to the sanctity of his territory in the eyes of the Moslem world, and the traffic of pilgrims between his ports and every other Moslem country. The keeping of the peace on land thus appears to be the crucial problem in that extension of the British trucial system over the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula, which has been carried a long way towards completion during the war. The Treaty with Bin Saud is our first experiment in this more highly-developed and difficult form of trucial relationship, and in their ruling on the Treaty a short time after its ratification (see above), the India Office laid down the important doctrine that ' we cannot admit that Article 2 is binding on us as against other Arabs.' On this ruling, our obligations to Bin Saud by land would be confined to securing bim against aggression on the part of some outside Power Turkey, Persia, * This seems a fair inductiou from our experiences during the war at Koweit. [939] E14 Germany, Russia, France). But it may perhaps be doubted whether our admitted obligations, under Article 1, regarding the demarcation of his territories would not commit us to active intervention against any other Arab ruler, such as King Husein, who might resort to force to reverse our award. It would appear desirable that, on this question, which affects all our new Arab relationships, a clear line of policy should be determined upon. (3.) Dynastic Guarantee. In concluding a trucial treaty with an Arab ruler, it has not been His Majesty's Government's custom to recognise it as binding them to his descendants. But it is evident that it would have been difficult to avoid doing so ultimately in cases in which our relationship had lasted over a long period, or in which the dynasty was firmly established and possessed prestigfe. The dynastic guarantee accorded to Bin Saud in Article 2 of the present Treaty merely follows a precedent already set in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (see Memorandum on British Commitments to the Gulf Chiefs), and it is hedged round with reservations. This would not appear to be so crucial a question as that of keeping the peace on land, but the history of our relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Katar shows that a dynastic guarantee might prove awkward in certain cases, and that the precedent should not too readily be made into a general rule.15 APPENDIX. TEXT OF THE TREATY OF DECEMBER 26, 1915. In the Name of (iod the Merciful aud Compassionate. Preamble. The High British Government on its own part, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud, Ruler of Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jubail, and the towns and porta belonging to them, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and tribesmen, being desirous of confirming and strengthening the friendly relations which have for a long time existed between the two parties, and with a view to consolidating their respective interests—the British Government have named and appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as their Plenipotentiary, to conclude a treaty for this purpose with Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud. The said Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox and Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-bin-Faisal Al-Saud (hereafter known as ' Bin Saud '), have agreed upon and concluded the following articles : I. The British Government do acknowledge and admit that Najd, El Hassa, Qatif and Jabail, and their dependencies and territories, which urill he discussed and determined hereafter, and their ports on the shores -'f the Persian Gulf are the countries of Bin Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Bin Saud as the independent Ruler thereof and absolute Chief of their tribes, and after him his sous and descendants by inheritance ; but the selection of the individual shall be in accordance with the nomination (i.e., by the living Ruler) of his successor ; but with the proviso that he shall not be a person antagonistic to the British Government in any respect; such as, for example, in regard to the terms mentioned in this treaty. II. In the event of [' unprovoked ' omitted] aggression by any foreign Power on the territories of the countries of the said Bin Saud and his descendants without reference to the British Government and loithout giving her an opportunity of communicating with Bin Saud and composing the matter, the British Government will aid Bin Saud to such extent and in such a manner as the British Govern ment after consulting Bin Saud may consider most effective for protecting his interests and countries. III. Bin Saud hereby agrees and promises to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or Power, and, further, to give immediate notice to the politicai authorities of the British Government of any attempt on the part of any other Power to interfere with the above territories. IV. Bin Saud hereby undertakes that he will absolutely not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, or otherwise dispose of the above territories or any part of them, or grant concessions within those territories to any foreign Power or to the subjects of any foreign Power* without the consent of the British Government. And that he will follow her advice unreservedly provided that it be not damaging to his own interests. V. Bin Saud hereby undertakes to keep open within his territories the roads leading to the Holy Places, and to protect pilgrims on their passage to and from the Holy Places. * The words ' or the subjects of any foreign Power ' were accidentally omitted in the copies signed by Sir P. Cox and Bin Saud on the 26th December, 1915. Sir P. Cox drew Bin Saud 's attention to this omission in a letter dated the 27th December, 1915 (38086/16), and added : ' I have duly written them in the text of the original document which I am submitting to Government, and Government will consider it in this form ; so that if the same mistake occurs in the copy with you, I trust you will add the words above quoted.'16 VI.
