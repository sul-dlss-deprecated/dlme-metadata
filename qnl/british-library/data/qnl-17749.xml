The letter also refers to a detailed statement of all the items plundered, which is no longer enclosed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024197023.0x00007f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
