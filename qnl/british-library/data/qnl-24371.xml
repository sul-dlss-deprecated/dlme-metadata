A&gt;' After Compliments. Reference your letter ho.l^S dated the lltn February 1934 regarding the claim of Abdul Aziz bin Hamad As-Salih against Sulaiman bin Salih al Fawwaz and Salih a1 Mansur. I beg to inform you that I have taken the necessary steps with regard to the claim of the said Abdul Aziz and made investigations in the matter. 1 find that Saikii bal’d bin Maktum, Ruler of hibai had dealt with the matter. I inquired from him as to the nature of the matter and it appeared to me that during his life-time, Hamad As-Sa.lin put in a complaint to the Shaikh who kept (Sulaiman bin)Salih al Fawwaz in jail as he purposely evaded the payment of tne dues of the late Hamad As-Salih. In the end a committee of merchants gathered in ccmnectoon with the case of the late Hamad As-Salih and (Sulaiman bin)Salih al Fav/waz and a sum of Rs.700/- was proved in favour of the said Hamad against (Sulaiman bin)Salih but, as the latter did not abide by this decision, the Shaikh put him in jail. Salih al Mansur intervened, caused the release of (Sulaimna bin)Salih al Fawwaz from jail and produced him before Hamad As-Salih who was requested by him to arrange a compromise between him and (Sulaiman bin)salih al Fawwaz. He wrote a document against (Sulaiman bin)Salih al la;,wi.*z and Salih al Mansur stood as a surety that in case(Sulaiman bin)Salih al Fawwaz fails to pay on the due dp-te, Salih Al Mansur will have to pay. I asked Salih al Mansur to pay up the money but he disagreed on the ground that he cancellec his undertaking in the presence of Shaikh 3a’id bin Maktum. The Shaikh says that Salih Al mansur approached him with the request that he may sell the belongings of (Sulaiman bin) Salih al Fawaz and that he(Shaikh)replied him that he was tne surety and as such he should himself sell the belongings2 . '4 1 L if. 1 of Bin Bawwaz and that if anyone interfered, he should let him know. So Salih al Mansur returned and the matter remain ed unsettled. I produced Salih al Mansur and(Sulaiman bin) Salih al Fawwaz along with the Shaikh where a lengthy discussion took place among them and it was held that the surety Salih al Mansur is responsible for the amount. He, hovrver, purposely evaded the payment and decided to leave for Hasa. I heard of this aifair and wrote to Shaikh Sai f d bin Maktum not to let him go until the matter is settled. The Shaikh wa,s helpful and accordingly he got him down from the mail steamer. Salih al Mansur had sent a man on his behalf to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jiluwi at Hasa giving him wrong information that an injustice had been done to him. I enclose, for your perusal, a copy of the document written by Salih al Mansur on (Sulaiman bin)Salih al Fawwaz in which the former wrote his undertaking. I also enclose, for your information, the letter of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jiluwi in original. I did not send a reply to him before consulting you. If anyone writes an undertaking against himself, how can he be released from it, but, he is bound to pay the amount for which he stood a surety. Salih al Mansur was not referred to Shara’ by anybody so as to cancell his undertaking. If you deem it fit, you can send a reply to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jiluwi.

The request came through the Deputy Foreign Minister, Fuad Bey Hamza, who said that shaikh Abdul Aziz was involved in some family dispute, and indicated that ibn Saud was greatly interested in the Shaikh, who I understand acts unofficially as his agent in Bahrain. i did not hold out any hope of intervention in what is probably a case for ti.~ -ourts, and I said that it was impossible for me to act on a second suggestion, that I should write to the British Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. iUs Majesty's Government have particular reasons at this moment for wishing to satisfy any legitimate desire of King Abdul Aziz as far as they can, and I should there fore be very grateful for any help you can properly afford to Shaikh Abdul Aziz al Qusaibi. 3ut x ^ faffiUiar wm the oriental belief in the possibility of mediation in all circumstances, however unsuitable from our point of view.

Rajab 1356 given by tne Ruler of Dubai to Munammad bin Issa Din Dakhan attorney for tbe neirs of Hamad bin Abdul Aziz as-Salin. From Sa f id Din Maktoom al-Hasior to all tiaose who may see tnis document among tne Rulers and Qadis of Islam, greetings. On this date Muhammad bin Isa bin Baknan,, attorney for tne neirs of the late Hamad Din Abuul Aziz as-Salih, nas come to me enquiring about the final decision given in the case between the said Hamad bin Abdul Aziz as-Salih with his partners Sulaiman as-Salih al-Fawwaz, and about the decision concerning Salih al-Mansoor, who guarranteed to him payment of the right which Sulaimaa. owes Ao him being an amount of Rs. 700/- as per a document in tne possession of the sons of Hamad as-Salih* I, therefore, say tnat Hamah bin Salih has made a complaint before me against nis partner Sulaiman al-Fawwaz about certain accounts recorded in their books, and about some misunderstandings between them. J referred them to a committee of merchants, in the house of Muhammad Faroogh, each of them elected certain arbitrators, and after they were present a decision was given ana2document of settlement was drawn between the two parties, both agreeing to it and signing it. The said document is in the possession of the sons of Hamad as-Salih,the settlement being that Sulaiman al—^awwaz owed to Hamad as-Salin a sum of Rs. 700/- which was guarranteed by Salih al-Mansoor who ultimately refused to pay the amount to Hamad and began to put excuses for evading payment. The object of Salih is to evade liability and put it on Sulaiman al-Fawwaz. Hamad then began coming to me frequently asking for his right , and I sent them to the ^adi, Shaikh Muhammad Din Abdul Salam, who decided that the goods available in the shop of Sulaiman should be sold and tne amount recovered and that any shortage in the amount due should be paid by Salih al-Mansoor, the guarrantor. As Sulaiman nad nothing, the matter stayed, and tne object of Salih was to tree himself from liability of the gaurranteewnilst Hamad was disagreeing and wants Salih to pay the amount guarranteed by him, discussions were prolonged and Hamad left for Iraq and died there, and the case remained pending at tnat stage* Then Salih al-Mansoor brought me a document, the tone of which tends to snow that it was written by me, which he asked me to sign. I signed the document without perusing it or knowing of its contents, and that was due to the shortage of time, and because of his repeated visits I signed it to keep him away. But it (the document) does not constitue a decision of settlement between him and his opponent, and if it contains anything which is conflicting to what is mentioned above then it cannot be relied upon.

Isa bin Abaul Latif. Jasim claimed ' from ^alih tne amount of Rs. 700/- owed by Sulaiman bin Salih al-tawwaz and guaranteed by him. After nearing botn litigants Salin did not deny tne guari'antee, I nave decided tnat ne is not liable for tue guar/antee from two pnaaes, firstly the guaranteed person did not confess far the right claimed against nim, and secondly the claimant nad the opportunity, of wnich he did not avail himself, of recovering his debt from the property of tne guaranteed person, through the decision of the then Qadi of tne town Shaikh Hyhammad bin Abdul Salam.

I is statement at the end of that dated 27th Rajab 1356 that he did not know the contents of the other document when he signed it, is obviously most unsatisfactory, and points to a degree of intrigue. This is t^e most recent document, and you will see that Shaikh Sa’ia states that the case remained pending when Hamad left for Ira^. 3. In the circumstances I can do no more than instruct the Residency i,gent, Sharjah to make efforts for a settlement of tne matter in Dubai. The case, as you probably itnow, is not one of a direct debt from Salih to Hamad, but arises from the fact that he went surety for penniless fritnu of uis, who had been imprisoned by Karaad. £ / w Assistant Political Agent, tehraiIDated 17th December 1941 The bearer| Mr. Jasim bin Muhammad, is a member of the staff of the Arabic Section of the Persian Gulf Residency.

They went to the Shaikh(of Dubai)and informed him of the claim against the defendant. A case started between the parties. In the end the defendant asked that the matter may be referred to, the Salifah experts for settlement. The Shaikh wanted to refer it there but Jasim bin Muhammexl bin Toq did not agree a.lthough they insisted on him to agree. Then &lt;*asim came to me and told me that he is not willing to go to the Salifah experts. I said to him that his case is against a diver and the man of Dubai denies that the diver is his and therefore it would be better for him tc prove his cla.im before the Salifah so that the man of Dubai ma.y not deny. He,however, pretended that he is not authorized to a.ccept the Salifah.
