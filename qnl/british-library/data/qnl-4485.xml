April 26th,1930 My dear Biscoe , Sheikh Khazal, who is still in Tehran, informs me that he has some outstanding claims for money lent to certain merchants in Kov/eit some years ago for which he has 'been pressing for payment for some time. Being to all intents and purposes a captive in Tehran he is unable to exercise himself the necessary pressure to obtain payment of these outstanding accounts. He has written to the Sheikh of Koweit, with whom he is on terms of intimate friendship, several times, 'but the latter only replies that these merchants promise to pay at some future time. He thinks that if the British Political ^gent in Koweit were to mention the matter to the Sheikh and ask him to take the steps necessary for the payment of the money owing, such representations would honourable Lieut-Colonel H.V.Biscoe, I,A. Political Resident in the Persia Gulf and His Majesty^ Consul-G-eneral, Bushire,BRiTlSH LEGATION f TEHRAN, -2- would have more effect than any letters Sheikh Khazal can v/rite from this far distant place. 2. I am writing therefore to ask you, should you see no objection, to be so good as to suggest to the Political Agent in Koweit that he might request the Sheikh of Koweit to use his good offices in favour of Sheikh Khazal so as to enable the latter to encash his claims as soon as may be possible.

We beg to inform Your Excellency that some of the indebted merchants are in straitailed circumstances and have nothing but house property to part with. These merchants have come to an agreement with IChan Bahadur Hirza Muhammad the Agent of His Excellency Shaikh IQiazaal, to band over certain houses at a certain price, in payment of the debts which they owe. This arrangement had actually taken place between them, but I refused to countersign the documents of conveyance which had taken place between them, as I was anxious to write and explain my point of view to you before doing so, and take your advice. 3. ' You are aware of the mutual friendship which used to exist between us and His Excellency Shaikh Khazaal, when he was an independent Ruler of his country, And you know how visits were contmnually exchanged between ^ohammerah and --uwai also how he afterwards had business connections with some Kuwait merchants and desired to buy certain houses from them during.my late predecessors 1 time, which properties he in fact bought and had registered in his name. 4. Now it seems he wants the new properties which he has recovered from some of the above merchants through his official Agent Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad, also to be register ed In his name.

M Dear aior j'ov/le, Please refer to ColoneJ/'discoe T s letter to Sir Robert Clive of July 11th last year regarding some outstanding claims of Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan against some merchants of Koweit. Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan informs me that his agent at Basrah, Khan Bahadur ilirza Mohammad succeeded in obtaining only a ver; small portion of these debts during his visit to Koweit last year and he has just paid another visit there. I enclose a copy of a letter lie has written to Havard for the information of Sheikh Khazal and in which he asks for some further help from us. The Sheikh has also continually asked us to help but we were awaiting the result of lirza Kohamrnad's second visit to Koweit to see if he could achieve anything without our intervention. You will see from the lette r lajor T.G.V/.Fowle C.B.H. n Acting Political Ke^icxent in the x ersian nul , 3ushire.Il ) / - BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN, letter that if Sheikh Khazal is to obtain any jart of these important outstandings Sheikh ...hmed lust give hi i more help than he appears to do. jb SheiKh Khazai is prevented by circumstances from taking pi ope i in lieu 0-l pa jTn 0nt, I ajii r it in, j you to ask that the Political Agent in Kuwait lay be authorised to request more energetic help; from Sheikh Ahmed especially as one or two of these debton appear to be of very bad faith. Yours sincerely,■D I Basra ^ m July 9 1931 pt.) I tainK it necessary to report the result of my recent visit l .0 Kuwait. I went there a few days ago,end the first thing I did was to refer to Mullah Salih,the Sheikhas secretary,to demand the payment of a claim amounting to Rs 24482,8. due by Mohammad al Marzuq,a merchant of Kuwait,who resides at Karachi while his son represents him at Kuwait. I have heen pursuing this debtor up hill and down dale during the last two years,'but he has successfully evaded me. One cannot take | any e - f ective measures in Kuwait such cases because there is no law in Kuwait.When I refer to Sheikh Ahmed on such questions he is extremely profuse in his assurances of his co -operation, out these do not appear to mean anything. The debtor's son will contend that he has no instructions from his father and Sheikh Ahmed cannot or will not bring pressure to bear upon the son to make payment or impose attachment on the available assets of the debtor with 9 view to compelling him to make a sd i- leiuent. One has therefore to bow down tc the inevitable &amp;nd suomit to the existing conditions.In connection with this particular case Sheikh Ahmed had written to me in April last that the debtor had promised to pay at the end of Dhilhijjah or during Koharram and assured me that payment would be jisde in due course 'as the man was very reliable'. Mullah Salih at my instance sent a wire to the debtor to send the amount and received the following reply:— 'Informed Ahmed (his son &amp; representative) paying six thousand.Particulars posted'.' This reply was received after my return to Basra and I wrote to Mullah Salih to receive Rs 6,000 and to remit to me by draft on a local merchant.I have also written to both Sheikh Ahmed and Mullah Salih begging them to take action towards recovering the balance due by the debtor.I now await a reply from them but this case illustrates the difficulties one has to face in such matters. rn-i xhere~ Page £. f There is another debt amouting to no less than its 1409o.:3 aue uy one named Jasim loin Mohaminad Budai.He slso resides at Karachi and was said to have gone bankrupt.I have been referring to She!Ah Ahmed several times.The Debtor owes His Excellency Sneikh &gt;thiiied Rs 61403 and ^&gt;53,000 according to a letter he wrote me last year and has been alleging all along that he has settled his account with Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan.This is of course untrue and I have fortunately doc uments in my possession which prove the claim against him. 1 suggested to Sheikh Ahmed to call upon the debtor either to come to Kuwait in person or depute an agent to appear before Sheikh Ahmed and litigate with me. He writes to Sheikh Ahmed under the date of J^ay 1G last as follows i—'as to your remark that we should appear in Basra or at Kuwait and compare accounts wi oh iv»irza Mohamjiiad Khan Bahadur,we beg to state in reply that there is no account between us and the aforesaid 'mirza Mohammad and that our account is with Sheikh Khazal 'and we have described the same to Your Excellency and have settled it on 30 Dhilqadeh 1345.There remains nothing due 'by us to him and we cannot appear with Mirza Mohammad and we do not think that it will be anjr use to do so'. I am at a loss what to do in such a matter.Here is a clear case but the debtor does not agree even to appear or depute an agent to meet me! Even if he did the chances are that Sheikh Ahmed will try first to recover his own claim and then to arrange payments by instalments to Sheikh Khazal which might cover a long period of years. There is a third claim,for Rs 15,000,against one Shamlan bin All bin Seif,an important pearl merchant. I have been de manding payment from him these last two years but he pleads inability. Mullah Salih writes to me 'the party has not suc ceeded in selling any part of his considerable assets,viz, 'pearls;and this is remarkable because his assets amount to 'about ten lakhs and he cannot arrange to pay this small sum. 'MyPage 3 rf My ixax respected brother,ali pearl-dealers are in the most 'straitened circumstances owing to inability to sell'. I saw the debtor a few days ago and remonstrated with him in the strongest possible manner,pointing out that the ineter est for all these years amounted to the equivalent of the cla and that it was unjust for him to delay payment any longer.He replied that he will arrange to pay within two months, A fourth claim is for Rs 8C,00C against one Fahad al-Fowzan and I have demanded payment several times but he alleges his pearls have remained a glut in the market,Sheikh Ahmed has not ceen aole to do anything in the matter despite repeated verbal and written promises.I interviewed the debtor when I was last at Kuwait and he repeated the same tele of woe. In any case something can surely be done to get a part of Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan's claims paid if Sheikh Ahmed had the will to take some action and I would suggest that some reference may,if possible,be made to him by H.M,Legation to ''expedite act ion'. The situation cannot be worse + han it is now and it will be interesting to see the effect of such a reference from the Legation. Yours etc (signed) Mirza.

A portion of the debts, however, was recovered, and paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia, Basrah, through Khan Bahadur ' irza ~ uhammad, the agent of H.Zl. Sir ]:Chaz T al Khan. The recovery of the balance is being dealt with, but all the people are now suffering from the financial crisis and there is nobody who is able to pay anything at present. Some of the debtors had given landed estates to His Excellency as mortgages, but at the end they failed to pay the debts and were compelled to give their landed estates, in a special manner, to His Excellency in payment of the debts, as, for fear that the Persian Government may put their hands on H.S.Sir Khaz T al Khan T s estates, no landed estates can ever be registerec in ''is name. We had made a 'Sanad' and sent it under our personal letter dated the 19th I.abi* II, 1349, (12-9-30), with a view that it may be signed by • — • -ir .ixhaz'al r-han, and that K.ivP s Government may give guarantee that the ersian Government shall not interfere with the estates belonging .-o His Excellency. This, however, was not agreed to. Therefore, no landed estates can be registered in the name of the above mentioned unless he would agree to the contents of the abovementioned 'Sanad' and H.LI T s Govern-Government give the required guarantee. As to the debtors, we are not neglecting their case, and shall press on them to pay something if they could , as the people are now suffering very badly from, the present financial crisis. If God please, circumstances will change from time to time, and the people will be able to pay their debts. Usual ending*I / ■ ' ' I \ ■* ' ' COHglDEWTTAL. ^ Politicel Agency, Kuwait. d .O.No. liO.

To begin with, Ahmed bin Mohammad al-Murzuq. sent off the Es 6000 ( about the last v/eek in July, and of the others not one is in a position to pay anything at present. Some of them make pro mises to pay on the conclusion of the pearl season if they are able to dispose of the pearls in their possession. This as you know is a repetition of the same old story and judging by the state of the market and the present ruling prices of pearls this promise seems to have a very weak found ation to pin one's faith on. It is known that there are many people in this town who owe H.E, the Shaikh money, and some of these also owe Shaikh IChazal, but very few indeed are aware of the colossal amount owed to the Shaikh, the astounding figure being more than three million rupees while Shaikh Khazal T s debtors don't owe a quarter of this amount. To take one example e.g, Shamlan, who is stated as owing Shaikh Ehazal 15,000 rupees while he owes H.E. Shaikh Sir Ahmad Rs 335,000. The Shaikh^however, has been putting aside his own claims so as to he!?^ Shaikh Khazal's Agent but I am inclined to the view. ble Major T.G.W.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.from the Shaikh's attitude during conversation that, should the Agent continue to give H.Excellency much trouble, he will prohably not get the success he hopes for and His Excellency would prohably then take the initiative on his own behalf rather than for another. Notwithstanding the foregoing His Excellency the Shaikh has promised to do as much as he can in helping towards the settlement of the claims of Shaikh Khazal, but in my opinion there seems a very poor chance of either an early or late</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001f5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/528</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001f5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/528</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/75 (D 156) Shaikh Khazal's Claim against Kuwaiti Merchants'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1930/1931</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-28T10:55:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (65 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>Condition: A bound correspondence volume.Foliation: The file's foliation sequence commences at the title page and terminates at the last folio; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between British officials regarding debts owed by a number of Kuwaiti merchants to Shaikh Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī, the former ruler of Mohammerah [Khorramshahr].The file also contains correspondence between British officials and the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ and Mirza Mohammad, Khaz'al's agent in Basra which discusses this issue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001f5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
