BAHRAIN. (33/116/500) 2nd August, 1950. / fiank you for your personal and confidential letter 7/6/28/50 of the 23rd July regarding the Sultan and his fron tiers with Saudi Arabia. 2 . I enclose for your information a copy of the telegram giving the text of the note referred to in my letter 33/91/50G of the 5 th July. This was presented by Trott to King Ibn Saud between the 24th and 26th July. 3. Perhaps I should have sent you a copy of the telegram giving the text of the whole note when I wrote to you before as I now see that you think the Sultan should be informed before there is any question of submitting the case to arbi tration or to a fact-finding commission. It is not, of course, possible to do that now, but in any case the Foreign Office instructions did not authorise doing it and I do not think they would have done so. 4 . I am afraid I have hardly the time to make the resume of the case since 1937 which you suggest should be handed to the Sultan, but unless you see any objection, I think he should be either shown the whole of the note (as telegraphed) which was handed to the Saudis or perhaps it would be better to inform him of the main points. As seen by me, these would presumably be (a) H.M.G's view of the situation in International Law, (b) the answer to the “tribal argument”, (c) Buraimi, (d) H.M.G. representing the Sultan, (e) H.M.G's agreement to adjoint technical commission“ and the conditions of that agreement, and (f) the reference to the “independent arbitral body'. 5. Some of these points you, of course, have made already as reported in your letter 12/6/28/49 of the 24th November, 1949 to Sir Rupert Hay. 6 . I would now like to do my best to suggest replies to the points made by the Sultan as described in para 5 of your letter. (a) The position has changed from 1937. At that time, as the Sultan very well knows, oil development in the Arabian peninsula was only just beginning and there was no necessity to define the frontiers between Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate. (b) The Saudi Government make no 'unsupported state ment of their claims' - in respect of the Sultanate of Muscat in any case. They merely make a statement of fact (or rather what I am very much afraid we are going to find out to be a fact), i.e. that the territory to the south and east of the /position Major F.C.L. Chauncy British Consul, Muscat. /i'A^position 24 25’ north and longitude 55 36' east is ’’under the authority of shaikhdoms which are not in treaty relations with the British Government” i.e. it is independent territory; and they have, therefore, the right to negotiate with these ”shaikhdoms”direct. • 6 . Is the Sultan able to traverse this statement of the position ? The Saudis have been quite clever about this, but there is, I repeat, no question of their making a state ment of claims or even of asking the Sultan to produce proofs as to where his boundaries lie. All they do is to make a statement of fact which if not controverted by the Sultan is going to demolish his claims to the areas in question for ever. I think he should be brought to realise in what dire danger he is. For years he has been talking about bringing the tribes under his control, that it would take time, that he had to go slowly, etc. etc. If ultimately it becomes apparent to the tribes that he has nothing to offer them and that H.M.G. is not going to intervene, it will be no time before the Saudis have gathered them into their orbit. It is true that the note states (para 11 (a)) that the 'joint technical commission” must be empowered to discuss the situa tion in regard to Buraimi and the area claimed by the Sultan of Muscat” - but that is not going to prevent the commission from finding that that area is independent.© ~LP E.Y TELEGRAM CYPHER OTP FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO BAHRAIN TELNO 277 DATED 22/6/50 RECD. 24/6/50. Confidential. Addressed to Jeddah telno 136 Saving of June 22nd repeated for information to Bahrain and Saving to B.M.E.O. and Washington. Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram. His Majesty's Government (have given careful consideration to the Saudi notes of December 10th 1949 and May 11th 1950. C Lpr*' ) V c They^propose in this note to deal only with the question of frontiers and will in due course send separate replies on the other subjects^dealt with in the Saudi note of May llth x, to which different considerations apply. 2. His Majesty's Government have noted with disappointment that the Saudi Government|J.n their note under replylhave not u ffl only failed to put forward any constructive proposals which might have formed the basis for further negotiations, but have confined themselves to repeating assertions which His Majesty’s Government have already contested. 3. The Saudi Government were informed^in the Embassy's note of November 30th 1949^that His Majesty's Government had felt obliged to take up their position on a basis of their extenua- * ting claim. This basis is as follows:-,. 4 . According to International Law Ibn Saud is the successor to the authority of the Turkish Government to which he acknow ledged his dependence in a Treaty of 1914 with that Government. The Turkish Government by signing the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 acknowledged that their authority in Arabia did not extend east of lines laid down in those conventions. Ibn Saud cannot therefore base a claim to the territory lying east of these lines on any event or circumstance existing prior to the conclusion of the Conventions. If then he desires to /establish- 2 - © establish a claim to any such area it is for him to prove that since 1914 he has acquired sovereignty in that area in accor dance with International Law, and for this purpose to put for ward any facts and events subsequent to that date on which he relies to support his claim. 5. His Majesty's Government have already dealt!in their note of November 30th 19491with the historical aspect of.Ibh Saud’s claim. They understand that he now maintains that his claim to certain areas is established by the fact that the nomadic tribes which owe him allegiance have occupied these areas, and that that allegiance in turn is established by the fact that the tribes in question have made payments of various kinds to the Saudi tax collectors. His Majesty's Government are unable to regard these facts even if they are established as constituting proof of sove reignty for the following reasons. 6 . In the first place, the movements of tribes, as is well known, are not fixed, but vary continually with the seasons, the weather, the state of grazing, and other pastoral circumstances. At dif ferent times areas may be temporarily used for grazing and other purposes by different tribes which may have at the time per formed the act such as payment of a tax in favour of different overlords. For Ibn Saud to claim sovereignty over an area merely because a tribe which had made payment to him happened on occasion to move over it or pass through it would be basing a claim to sovereignty over territory on the grounds less substantial than International Law requires. 7. In the second place tribal payments, as is well known, may in some cases amount to no more evidence that tribes thought it a/O-'M (gp.undec) in the circumstances to engaging a dispute with a powerful neighbour. 8 . For these reasons His Majesty's Government consider that the territorial frontiers can not be laid down on the basis of such uncertain factors as irregular movements and the fluctuating allegiances of nomad tribes. Nor can His Majesty's Government see the necessity to do so in view of their earlier proposals to which the Saudi Arabian Government agreed, that the tribes /should© t), Qyw^ \ ( ) (jV^ - 3 - Y should be permitted to move freely for grazin g and Musablla across any frontier which may be determined. 9. As regards the particular case of Buraimi and its adjacent areas^to which reference is made in para 6 of Mr. Butter's note of December 10th 1949^ H.M.G. are unable to accept the conten tion that these areas are populated by Saudi Arabian tribes. Buraimi is claimed by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who is under H.M.G's protection. In view of these conflicting claims it is evident that there must be investigation and H.M.G cannot (sic) over this matter]which it will fall to H.M.G. to conduct in ,J ) view of their responsibility for the foreign relations of Abu Dhabi. 10. As for the Sultan of Muscat, he is, of course, a fully independent monarch. He has however requested H.M.G. to nego tiate with the Saudi Government on his behalf in regard to any area under his jurisdiction to which the Saudi Government may lay claim, and H.M.G. have consented to do so. 11. H.M.G.'s note that the Saudi Govt.('in the last paragraph of their note of December 10th 194^)have expressed willingness to join H.M.G. in a joint study of the true state of affairs in regard to frontiers. It is understood that by this the Saudi Arabian Govt, mean a joint technical commission composed of representatives of the two sides accompanied by the necessary experts who would proceed to the frontier areas in dispute with the object of ascertaining on the ground the true facts regarding the geographical features and past and present tribal situation of those areas together with any of the rele vant factors. The Saudi Arabian Government will recall that when a proposal to this effect was made informally on a previous occasion, H.M.G. indicated their agreement in principle; though they felt obliged to point out that, since it is necessary not merely to ascertain the facts but to determine the legal con sequences which follow from them, such a study alone will not produce a solution unless it is conducted in an objective manner and is followed by negotiation in which accommodation is shown in both sides. In order, however, to demonstrate once again m /their4 f v I their willingness to accept and participate in any step which might bring nearer the prospect of an agreed solution to the problem they are prepared to agree to the Saudi Arabian Govt's proposal, provided that (a) The Saudi Arabian Government agree that the commis sion shall be empowered to discuss, as part of their general investigation, the situation in regard to Buraimi and the area claimed by the Sultan of Muscat; and (b) for the reasons given in paragraph 4 above, the Saudi Arabian Government are prepared to furnish detailed evidence in e^wr support of the claim eastward(of the blue and violet line jwhich they have put forward. 12. H.M.G. earnestly hope tnat the technical study will lead to the establishment of sufficient facts to provide a basis for a further negotiation and an eventual settlement. Should, however, this not prove to be the case they would feel obliged to consider whether the legitimate rights of the Persian Gulf states under their protection would not be better secured by the decision of an independent arbitral body based on the principles of International Law. They wo.ld be reluctant to recommend XHEhxaxKHMFXff recourse to such a body, in view of their long tradition of friendship and direct dealing with Ibn Saud, and they are still convinced that an equitable settle ment of the question if the Saudi Arabian Govt. 6 n their part, will, in the course of the technical study and subsequent negotiations, show that spirit of accommodation of which H.M.G. throughout the past negotiations have given such abun dant evidence.Personal &amp; Confidential. 7/6/28/50. ?he British Consulate, MUSCAT. 23rd July, 1950. Ly dear Pelly, Please refer to your letter No. 33/91/50 G dated the 5th July 1950. 2. I am in complete agreement that the Sultan should be informed before there is aqy question of submitting the case affecting his borders to axbitration or to a 'joint' f a ct finding commission. 3 * I have very little on my records to show how the position has^ apparently^from the Sultan's point of view, deteriorated from the position when he was asked to agree to the 1937 line: the Sultan has even less, and I believe he is quite ignorant of the present nature of the Saudi claims, except for the contents of my letter No. 12/6/28/49 dated the 24 th November 1949 to which he replied as in my telegram No. 7 of the 4-th January 1950. 4« I think therefore that he should be presented with a concise resume' of the case since 1937 , and that he should then be asked whether he agrees to His ’“ajesty* s Government continuing to negotiate on his behalf, and the lines they propose to follow. I am not sure that, when he hears the present proposal, he may not ask to be left to carry out his own negotiations: though he is of course fully aware of his weakness and lack of the arwoury of legal and other advice available to His '^jesty's Government. It is this realisation that so often makes him fight shy of negotiations or of comm itting himself in any way with even His ^tiesty's Government. 5* ^h„t I think the Sultan finds it so hard to understand is (a) how the position did change from the 1937 line, and (b) why the Saudi Government cannot be called upon to make a full statement of their case, not just an unsupported statement of their claims, affecting his boundaries, and then he will endeavour to make his reply. £• However, without consulting him all this is merely guess work - he is impossible to predict. All I feel really sure about is in agreement with you, that he should be told what has happened to date,and the present proposal as far as it af/ects him, andvwhether he agrees. CLoAjlJ Yours sincerely, C. J. Pelly Esq, O.B.E. Offg: Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. UC.BHITIbH i^blD^GY Bahrain . Ri^rioOlutiL oc COi^l Iij^TI tiL 33/91/50G 5th J uly, 1950 V The i' , orei 6 n Office have now agreed to the Sauai proposal that a 'joint comi. ission” (of our side and the oauai side) should be appointed to study 'the true state of affairs in regard to the frontier' and it seems that a note to that effect will shortly be presented by Trott to the oaudi Arabian Government. There are certain provisos attached to the acceptance, but never theless I have freely expressed, since the proposal was first mooted, the gravest misgivings regarding the. results of the findings of such a commission which, I would wager, will be most prejudicial to the case of our Shaikhs and the oultan. These misgivings have been dismissed by the foreign Office as considerations 'of which we are, of course, well aware'. In the note which it is proposed to present to Ibn saud the nope is expressed that the commission's work will lead to the establishment of sufficient facts to provide a basis for further negotiations and an eventual settlement. The note goes on 'should, however, this not prove to be the case they (H.M.G.) would feel obliged to consider whether the legitimate rights of the Persian Gulf states under tneir protection would not be better secured by the decision of an independent arbitral body based on the principles of Inter national Law'. 2. The reference to arbitration is only in regard to the 'protected Sheikhdoms'. The Sultan, however, has put tne negotiations regard ing nis frontier with Ibn Saud into our hands and the Foreign Office has said that we 'may consider it desirable that the Sultan of Muscat should be informed of our reply It could be stressed that we are only referring to arbitration as tne best means of avoiding it while if we left it to the oaudis to propose it we should have difficulty in refusing'. (Personally I do not think that the Foreign Office will avoid arbitration so that the argument in this last sentence is pointless, but that is another matter). The fact is that we are running the risk of submitting the oultan's boundaries to the decision of an international arbitral body. I am inclined to think that he should be informed of the substance of our reply to the daudis, but I should be grateful for your comments as soon as possible. Major F.C.L.

His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom assume that paragraph 5 of the Saudi Arabian Government’s statement is in tended to refer to Buraimi; here the claims of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi give His Majesty's Government an undoubted right to negotiate on his behalf. His Highness the Sultan of Muscat claims that the areas south of Buraimi are under his authority and he has asked His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to represent him in these negotiations. The Sultan of v uscat and Oman was especially mentioned in the Amir Abdulla's decla ration and His Majesty's Government trust that Saudi policy towards him has not changed.

He also referred to Buraimi and seemed surprised to find that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had claims there. I said that it was well known. He asked what was meant by their 'previously admitting' anything of the sort and I explained what that meant. He also referred to the Imam Khalil, as being a source who had no axe to grind with anybody. 5. He seemed delighted with the declaration by Abdullah in 1866: he maintained that it obviously meant that he still kept sovereignty over Muscat, as that was what the collection of zakat implied. (This is anyhow what he seemed to imply: I will not swear he actually said it in words). ABDULLAH'S DECLARATION.
