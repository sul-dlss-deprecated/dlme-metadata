He states that he proceeded to Cape Nabend [Damāgheh-ye Nāy Band], where he made enquiries about the recent piratical attempt. On 10 January he anchored at Sharja [Sharjah] and sent Hadji Jacoob, Agent at Sharja, to the shore, who returned the following morning with Ahmed, the Lungar [Bandar-e Lengeh] Agent. Porter relays intelligence received from Ahmed, which describes a fight that took place near Sharja. Porter reports that Shaik Sayed ben Thanoon [Shaikh Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan] had brought 800 men from Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] to fight against one hundred men of the Beni Katap [Banī Qitab] tribe. The members of the tribe were supported by 300 men under the charge of Khalit ben Sultan [Shaikh Khalid bin Sulṭān Āl Qāsimī], son of Sultan ben Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī], and by 200 men under the charge of Abdullah ben Sultan of Sharja [Abdullah bin Sulṭān, Governor of Sharjah]. Porter goes on to give details of the recent movements of some of the Arab rulers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612308.0x000009#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
