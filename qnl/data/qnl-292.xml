                           Elphinstone(folios 90-91, 93, 25, 201). During Hennell’s absence from the British Political Residency at Bushire, his official correspondence was carried out by Lieutenant Arnold Burrowes Kemball, the Assistant Resident.The correspondence is predominantly political, discussing events in the Persian Gulf in terms of their significance for British foreign policy, relations and interests in the region. The main topics of discussion are: British suppression of piracy and slave trafficking in the Persian Gulf, relations between the Arab Maritime Chiefs of the Trucial Coast, the Imam of Muscat and the Ruler of Nedgd [Najd], relations between British and Persian authorities in Shiraz and Bushire.Many of the Resident’s letters to the Bombay Government refer to enclosures, the majority of which are present in the volume, including several documents dated 1848 and one document dated 1846 (folios 4-5). Among the enclosures are copies of the Resident’s Arabic and Persian correspondence with agents, officials and rulers. These are in the form of English translations only.MUSCAT: Khojeh Hiskael the British Government Native Agent at Muscat, Syed Soweynee [Sayyid Thuwayni bin Sa‘id Al Bu Sa‘id] the Governor of Muscat and the Imam of Muscat [Sa`id bin Sultan Al Sa‘id] correspond with the Resident about the importation of African slaves by sea from Zanzibar to Muscat; the contemplation of an attack on Bahrain by the Imam of Muscat at the request of Bahrain seceders; alleged aggressions against the territories of the Imam of Muscat by Sheikh Syf ben Humood [Sayyid Syf bin Ḥamūd Āl Bū Sa‘īd] and Sheikh Sultan ben Sugger [Sultan bin Saqr] of Rysulkhyma [Ras Al-Khaimah] (folios 131-135, 231-231).BAHRAIN: Hajee Jassem the British Government Native Agent at Bahrein and Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa [Shaikh Muḥammed bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah] the Chief of Bahrein correspond with the Resident about piracy in Bahrein; the death in Muscat of ex-Chief of Bahrein Abdoollah ben Ahmed [‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah] on 6 March 1849; the restoration of peace in Bahrain following the settlement of Sheikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa’s quarrel with Bahrain seceders and his reconciliation with rival tribal leaders; the plans of Ameer Fysul [Al Sa‘ud, Amir Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah] the Ruler of Nedgd [Najd] to recover possession of Brymee [Buraimi] and rebuild Adeed [Khor al-Udaid] (folios 6-9, 37-38, 48, 55-56, 60-61, 140-142, 170-171, 198-199, 260, 283-284).SHARJAH: Moollah Houssein the British Government Native Agent at Shargah forwards to the Resident a reply he has received from Sheikh Sultan ben Suggur of Rysulkhyma about the importation of African slaves into Shargah; he also sends several reports to the Resident about various matters, including the siege of Brymee and its eventual surrender by Sheikh Saeed ben Tahnoon [Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan] the Chief of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] to the forces of Ameer Fysul the Ruler of Nedgd (folios 10-14, 19-21, 42-44, 52-53, 58, 154-157, 161-164, 166-168, 207-208).OMAN: Ameer Fysul the Ruler of Nedgd and the Shereef (Sharif) of Mecca correspond with the Resident about Sheikh Saeed Tahnoon's seizure and eventual surrender of Brymee (folios 27-28, 58-59, 164-165).SHIRAZ: Meerza (Mirza) Mahmood the British Government Native Agent at Shiraz sends several reports to the Resident about the gradual restoration of public order in Shiraz, following the arrival of Prince Bahram Meerza the new Governor of Fars, on 3 February 1848 (folios 14-17, 40-41, 89-90, 92).BUSHIRE: the Resident corresponds with Prince Bahram Meerza the Governor of Fars about excessive amounts of Persian import duty demanded from Bushire merchant Joseph Malcolm, for imported sugar landed at Bushire in a British merchant ship (folios 64-67, 78, 95-96, 227-228).
