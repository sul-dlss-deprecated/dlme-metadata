Persian Gulf. Turkish Jurisdiction along the Arabian Coast. (Part IV.) {Continuation of Memorandum, dated the 2nd December 1881.) Government of India Letter, No. 145, of the 30th October 1881, which requested instructions as to the nature of their future relations with the Sheikh of El Bidaa, and raised incidentally a question as to the scope of the orders issued by * Part III., pp. 24 and 25. the Admiralty in July 1881* to the Commanders of Royal Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf in re spect to the suppression of piracy in those waters, was forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 4th January 1882, with the draft of a Despatch which, if concurred in by Lord Granville, it was proposed f To Foreign Office, 4th January 1882, to send to India in reply to the reference made.f No. 6. The material paragraphs of the draft ran as J Secret Despatch to India, No. 3, dated follows :—| 20th Janaary 1882. The Chief in question [El llidaa] occupies a part of the coast where the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Sultan has not been formally recognized by Her Majesty’s Government, and is, in fact, little more than nominal ; but he appears to fly the Turkish flag on shore and to have admitted a Turkish garrison into his fort. On the other hand, he is in constant communication with the British Resident in the Gulf ; he has lately abandoned a contemplated maritime expedition to the neighbourhood of the Turkish port of Kateef, in deference to the remonstrances of that officer, to whose orders in such matters he professes his intention to submit; and he has explicitly stated that he regards the seas of those parts as being ‘ under the British Government.’ “ 3. It seems, therefore, that, to whatever extent the Chief may have accepted the position of an Ottoman dependant, he, like his father before him, maintains very close and direct relations with the authorities of the Indian Government, and is prepared to defer to them in all matters affecting the peace of the seas. In the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, this disposition on the part of the Sheikh should be encouraged. There is nothing in it incompatible with corresponding relations on his part with the Turks as regards his affairs on land, while, if he act up to his professions and abstain from ill treatment of British subjects, the precise nature of those relations may be a matter of comparative indifference to the Indian Government, whose consistent policy has been to restrict its interference with the tribes on the Arab coas t—whether parties to the maritime truce or not—to the measures necessary to prevent hostilities at sea, and to hold aloof from their quarrels and concerns on the mainland. io this policy Her Majesty’s Government desire to adhere. “ 4. As regards the course which should be followed in the event of the Sheikh of El Bidaa, or any other Chief similarly situated, putting to sea with hostile intentions, without reference to, or in disregard of the warnings of, the British Resident, it is not possible for me to give your Excellency in Council precise instructions. It must depend npon the circumstances of each particular ca-^e, and upon the extent to which the peace of the .‘■e.is may be menaced. From the correspondence which has passed within the hist two years on the subject of Turkish pretensions to jurisdiction along the Arab coast it will have been seen that while Her Majesty’s Government are not disposed to object to extension of the Sultan’s authority over [the tribes of the Katr peninsula, provided such authority be effectively exercised, it is their fixed !M28. 1.3181. A It2 determination neither to allow the Turkish local officials to use the quasi-independent tribes as instruments of aggression on Bahrein and the territories of the trucial Chiefs, nor to permit the tribes to carry on piratical expeditions with impunity under the shelter of the Turkish flag. The question, therefore, whether coercion should be employed upon any particular occasion is one which must be decided by your Excellency’s Government upon general considerations of expediency, with special reference to your interest in the maintenance of peace at sea, as well as to your obligations to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the trucial Chiefs. “ 5. From the foregoing observations your Excellency in Council will perceive that the instructions lately issued to the commanders of Her Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf were not intended to bear the very restricted construction which has been placed upon them by your Government, and by the Resident in the Gulf. As Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to intimate to the Porte in July last,* the relusal of • Lord Granville to Lord Dufferin, No. 515, the Turkish Government to entertain the proposals made to it for dated 22nd July 1881. a sort of joint police of the seas along the Arab coast compelled Her Majesty’s Government to undertake that duty single handed, ‘ without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial ‘jurisdiction in those waters.’ The instructions in question were accordinglv issued, the intention being that the commanders of British cruisers in the Gulf should have liberty to act as might be necessary to prevent, or punish, disturbance of the peace of the seas, avoiding, however, the raising of needless questions with the Turkish local authorities, where they exist, or unnecessary encroachment upon the jurisdiction of the Sultan, wherever it may really be effectively established along the coast north of Odeid.” Lord Granville’s concurrencef in the foregoing 7 f From Foreign Office, '12th January interpretation of the Admiralty instructions, and, 1882, No. 29. as was understood, in the draft as a whole, was intimated on the 12th January, and the Despatch (Secret; No. 3) accordingly went to India on the 20th idem, the connected correspondence being forwarded in a separate Despatch (Secret; No. 4) of the same date. Shortly afterwards, a further letter from IndiaJ X Secret Letter from India, No. 3, dated raised a more difficult question in connection with 9th J anuai 7 18 82. our relations with the Sheikh of El Bidaa, viz., what procedure should be adopted in order to obtain redress for ill treatment or extortion practised by him upon British Indian subjects resident there. The question arose out of certain acts of Sheikh Jasim in October 1881, as to which Colonel Boss wrote to the Government of India (12th November 1881) as follows :— “ 2. The facts have been fully ascertained by inquiry on the spot conducted by Captain Neasham and the Agent, Arab Coast, whom I had instructed to visit El Bidaa. There has been no misbehaviour ou the part of the banians, and there is no justifi cation for Jasim’s treatment of them, the plea of expense in pro tecting them being clearly insincere. Jasim, doubtless, desires to get rid of the Indian traders altogether, but 1 suspect he is, also, to some extent, actuated by other feelings than mere cupidity. He does not feel sure what his position is now in relation to the British Government, and, no doubt, wishes to draw conclusions from observing the course adopted by British authority with reference to his proceedings. If he perceives that we abstain from direct action, he will consider himself secure of impunity through Turkish prestige and indifference, and will probably pro ceed to greater lengths against our subjects, and may disregard our interests and wishes in other still more important respects. It is a question (and Jasim is quite alive to this) of whether this Sheikh is to be considered by us as still an independent Sheikh, or merely a Turkish Governor, or as something between the two. “ 3. It seems necessary that some notice should be taken of Jasim bin-Mohammed’s gratuitously affronting behaviour. In a former similar case which occurred in the lifetime of Jasim’s father, the latter preferred to make amends direct to us, and the matter was so settled. Had he, however, refused redress and nealed to his Turkish connection, force could not w r ell have been3 employed. I apprehend that Jasim would now decline to give any adequate satisfaction for present misbehaviour and would prefer to face the result. Appeal to the Turkish authorities for satisfaction may appear the simplest course, but it has this dis advantage, that to judge from all past experience it would elicit no satisfactory result Moreover, Government might not desire, as matters now stand, to make so plain an admission regarding the status of Jasim-bin-Mohammed and the district of El Bidaa. Unsuccessful reference to Turkish authority would both irritate and encourage Jasim, so that if that course is adopted, it would be, I think, desirable to intimate to the Turkish Government that if they failed to punish Jasim-bin-Mohammed and make him apologize for his aggressive behaviour, the British Government would have to hike the matter into their own hands.” In reporting the matter to the Secretary of State, the Government of India wrote :— “ 2. We would propose, if so authorized by Her Majesty’s Go- varnment, to inform the Sheikh that we cannot permit the arbi trary treatment of British Indian subjects, and that in future he will be directly responsible for any act inconsistent with the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between him and the British Government. Meanwhile we have instructed Colonel Ross to address the Chief warning him to avoid any ill treatment of the banians, pending the orders of the Government on his recent proceedings.” * To Foreign Office, 3rd March 1882, No. 152. The proposal of the Government of India obviously involved the use of force against the Sheikh in certain contingencies, and the use of force might bring about a collision between the British authorities in the Gulf and the Turkish garrison in the fort of El Bidaa, which would be a serious matter. On the other hand had lb be borne in mind the doubts which exist whether,—notwithstanding the garrison,—the Turkish Government exercises any real authority over the Sheikh, and the certainty that representations at Constantinople in regard to his proceedings would have no practical result,— at all events within any reasonable time. Moreover, there appeared good ground for sup posing that, if the Sheikh could be made really to understand that the Ottoman flag would not be allowed to shield him, and that—Turks or no Turks —redress for arbitrary acts would be exacted, the necessity for using force would not arise. The papers w^ere, accordingly, referred to the Foreign Office with the following remarks :—* “As Lord Granville is aware, the difficulty in dealing with the matter arises from the circumstance that the Sheikh has admitted a detachment of Turkish troops into the Fort of El Bidaa, and, when he finds it convenient so to do, professes himself a dependant of the Ottoman Sultan. “ It has already been determined that in the event of his being concerned in aggression on Bahrein or on the territories of the trucial Chiefs, or of his disturbing the peace of the seas, he shall be punished by the British authorities in the Peisian Gulf, not withstanding his relations with the Turkish Government. “ Having regard to the uncertain character of those relations and to the proved futility of diplomatic representations at Con stantinople respecting occurrences at El Bidaa, Lord Hartington is disposed to think that the direct responsibility of the Sheikh should also be enforced in order to obtain redress for outrages on British subjects resident there. “ His Lordship accordingly, if Lord Granville concurs, proposes to authorize the Government of India to address the Sheikh in the sense they suggest.” This course did not command unanimous ap proval here. It was objected to by some on the4 ground (1) that El Bidaa had been repeatedly recognized as Turkish; (2) that we were departing from our policy of non-interference on land with the Sheikhs of the Arab coast; and (3) that it was not expedient £ ‘ to follow our British Indian subjects all “ over the world, and redress their grievances every- “ where, great and small, with fire and sword.” The Secretary of State, however, did not concur in this view, though admitting that our position was not quite a logical one. Lord Hartington* did not suppose there was anything else in tli\e world which exactly resembled our relations with the Arab Sheikhs in the Persian Gulf, wdiere we claim absolute authority at sea and practice non-inter ference on shore. ’ He thought that we might very well continue this policy as regards the territorial dis putes of the Sheikhs, but that it was a different matter when they proceeded to oppress and ill-treat British subjects.' To allow this would, he conceived, fatally weaken the influence which was so beneficially ex ercised for the suppression of piracy in the Gulf. If the Turkish Government was to protest against any proceedings which might become necessary, the situation might become awkward; but it was pro bable, His Lordship thought, they would prefer that we should take the measures required, rather than worry them to take the measures themselves. Lord Granvillef having intimated his concur rence in the procedure recommended by the Go vernment of India, that Government was informedf that Her Majesty’s Government approved of a communication being addressed to the Sheikh of El Bidaa in the sense proposed. It was added:— « They trust that it may prove sufficient for the object in view, and that your Resident in the Gulf may be able to obtain redress for any well founded grievances of British subjects, without being compelled to request the sanction of your Excellency’s Govern ment to coercive measures which the Sheikh’s relations with the Porte render it desirable to avoid as long as possible.” In January 1882,§ Captain Neasham, in Her Majesty’s ship “ Woodlark,” under instructions from the Resident, visited El Bidaa, with the object of sounding Sheikh Jasim as to whether he was willing to consider as still binding upon himself the engagement with Colonel Belly entered into by his father in 1868. || At an interview with Captain Neasham, the Sheikh expressed a strong desire to renew the engagement in question, modified in some respects to meet the altered circumstances of the present day, and his anxiety to get rid of the Turks, whom he regretted having ever admitted into his country. - He wrote a letter to the Resident confirming his statements to Captain Neasham, upon receipt of which Colonel Ross (17th February) reported what had passed to the Government of India, recom mending that, if there were no insuperable objec tions, a°formal renewal of the engagement of 1868 should be obtained, with the alterations necessary to suit change of circumstances. He had no doubt the Sheikh would be willing to act up to those clauses which remain applicable. * Note, 2nd March 1882. f From Foreign Office, 13th March 1882, No. 182. J To India; Secret, No. 19, dated 24th March 1882. Secret Letter from India, No. 37, dated May 1882. || See Part 111., pp. 27 and 29.But the Government of India did not think this course advisable. The Resident was informed (28th April) :— In reply, I am to say that it appears to the Governor Ge- neml^ in Council undesirable to risk complications with the Tuikish Government by entering into formal relations with Sheikh Jasim ; for, although the British Government have never foi mally recognized the jurisdiction of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan at El Bidaa, yet that jurisdiction has been established them de facto, and its existence has not been contested bv the Government of India or its officers. Moreover, it appears pro- bade that the Sheikh would not be willing to enter into such an agreement unless the British Government engaged to protect him against the I urks in any measures which he might find necessary for the due execution of his obligations. I am, therefore, to say that it would seem sufficient, for present purposes, if you could effect a verbal understanding with the Sheikh, for the observance, as far as may be possible, of the terms of the agreement of 1868.” * To Foreign Office, 26th June 1882, No. 434. f From Persian Gulf, No. 27, dated 4th August 1882. f From Persian Gulf, No. 29, dated 14th August 1882. § From Persian Gulf, No. 27, dated 4 th August 1882. These papers were communicated to the Foreign Office,* and acknowledged to the Government of India without remark. Unfortunately the attitude which Sheikh Jasim now assumed was such as to make impracticable the policy indicated by the Indian Government. In reply to a warning from the Residentf to refrain from any “ ill treatment of Indian traders “ residing at El Bidaa,” the Sheikh (30th January 1882) wrote to the effect that the banians (traders) had better go to Bahrein, and that he did not wish for them in his country, as they interfered with the dealings of his own people in pearls. Consequent on a further letter (9th March 1882) to the same purport and containing complaints of the conduct of the banians, and as it was necessary to make to Sheikh Jasim the communication authorized in the Secretary of State’s Despatch of the 24th March, Colonel RossJ decided to depute to El Bidaa the Residency Moonshee, Mirza Abul Kasim, who has had much experience on the Arab coast, and been frequently employed on agency duty. The Mirza was to remain at El Bidaa as long as might be requisite; to hear and investigate any complaints made by the Sheikh against the baniaus; to remove any just cause of discontent which the former might have; and to endeavour to persuade Jasim to withdraw his objection to the residence of the Indians at El Bidaa for trading purposes, and to obtain a promise of fair treatment of them in future. He was the bearer of the following letter from Colonel Ross to the Sheikh, dated 29th May:—§ “ I now send Mirza Abul Kasim to your town to investigate the charges against the banians, and hear all sides of the question. You must know that I am always ready to hear complaints and investigate them, and, if British subjects commit ofiences which are punishable, they will be punished. “ If, however, they behave properly and regularly, it would he quite inconsistent with the friendly relations hitherto subsisting between the British Government and your father and yoursilf, for you to eject these British subjects, or molest them, or suffer them to be molested. I expect from your friendly feelings, so often expressed, that you will accord the banians just and fair treatment. If 3 on should unfortunately adopt a different cause, it would be inconsistent with friendly relations, and you would cer- 9429. B6 taiuly be held directly and personally responsible for all losses and injuries to British subjects. I trust you will give this com munication your great attention, as it is written under orders from the Government.” The Mirza arrived at El Bidaa in the latter part of June, and found the banians in an excessive state of alarm, and “ like fowls in front of foxes.” All his efforts to bring Sheikh Jasim info a more reasonable frame of mind were fruitless. The Sheikh professed the most friendly sentiments towards the Resident and the British Government, but insisted upon the removal of the banians, upon the ground that (1) they interfered with his own trading operations; (2) they put him to expenses for their protection, for which they refused to pay ; and (3) they misconducted themselves generally. The accusations brought against them were re ported by the MTrza to be “ all libels, mere excuses to avoid the necessity of saying the banians were not wanted merely because they were traders. Early in July Jasim issued a notification to the effect that his son Khalifah was Chief, to whom all claims and complaints were to be preferred, and whose orders were to be obeyed. Khalifah immediately made pecuniary demands upon the banians, and, payment being refused, closed their shops by force, under orders from Jasim. He appears to have been encouraged to take this course by the impunity which had attended similar proceedings in 1881, and also by reports which reached him from his Bombay Agent, who arrived at El Bidaa at this time, as to what was going on in Egypt. This man is stated to have said:— “ The Egyptians have killed four Ambassadors of foreign Go vernments T of the number, there were the Ambassadors of France and England, and now 80,000 men have collected together, wanting to fight foreign Governments, the reason being they do not want their subjects to be in their country. And you, Oh Jasim ! if you do not see it expedient that the banians should remain in your country, their is no compulsion on you.” On the 20th July Her Majesty’s ship “ Woodlark ” arrived at El Bidoa.* At that time the banians were surrounded in their houses by Beni Hazir guards, who prevented any communication between them and the town’s people, and kept them in lear of their lives. In these circumstances, and as Sheikh Jasim, at a final interview with Mirza Abul Kasim, continued to insist on their removal from the country, they decided to go under protest. They were 'permitted to ship their goods in native dhows, the “ Woodlark ” remaining off the port meanwhile, and left the place on the 22nd July. ^ Mirza Abul Kasim also left in the “ Woodlark ” on the same date. His treatment by the Sheikh had been discourteous, and threats of violence were used towards him. In writing to the Residency Agent at Bahrein, Jasim accused the Mirza of having acting unjustly, and represented the departure of the banians as a yoluntary act on their part. These statements were # From Persian Gulf, No. 29, dated 24th August 1882.• From Persian Gulf, No. 27 : August 1882. f From Persian Gulf, No. 29, August 1882. • 7 characterized by the Agent as “ false and deceptive,^ the fact being that the Sheikh fancied “ his con- “ nection with the Turks secured him from chastise- “ ment by the British Government.” Various circumstances indicated that that con nection had become rather closer than of yore, for, on the 11th July, a Cazi arrived at El Bidaa, on the , dated 4th part of the Turkish Government,* to remain there and carry on the duties of a Judge, hut with instructions “ to act according to the wish of Jasim;” and it was said that the Governor of El Hasa, having heard reports of the ill treatment of Brit is If subjects, remonstrated with the Sheikh, though without any result. Colonel Boss, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, had started on leave to England, when news of these transactions reached him. lie at once re turned to Bushire, and (22nd August) reported to the Government of India what had occurred, with dated 24th hj s views as to the steps necessary to be taken.j* His report, after stating shortly the history of the British connection with El Bidaa, and the course of the affair of the banians up to the period of Mirza Abul Kasim’s deputation, continued as follows:— “ I had every expectation that at least a temporary arrangement would be effected, and the attitude adopted by Sheikh Jasim is matter of surprise to me. 1 was awaie that his objection to the banians springs from self-interest. He trades in pearls himself, and desires a sort of local monopoly which the operations of the banians interfere with. It was, therefore, to be expected that he would not immediately yield the point, but the sudden and violent manner of his ejectment of the Hindoos, in the face of the warning conveyed to him, is little less than an act of defiance to the Govern ment whose subjects they are. He appears to have been to some extent influenced and encouraged by evil advisers, who told him that Europeans hail been ejected from Egypt, and that his con nection with the Turkish Government would save him from unpleasant consequences. I understand, moreover, he is irritated against British authority on account of my refusal to permit him to occupy Odeid, and some other matters. “ 8. The ejectment of the Hindoo traders from El Bidaa, and sudden interference with their commerce, has subjected them to losses which they estimate at Rs 50,000. Probably this may be reduced somewhat, but the sum may be taken to represent British claims against Sheikh Jasim. “ 9. I have fully ascertained that the charges alleged by Jasim against the banians are altogether groundless, and the inhabitants of El Bidaa generally have no complaints against those traders, and would prefer their remaining there, and blame Jasim’s proceedings. “ 10. 1 have throughout, in dealing with Sheikh Jasim, exercised the greatest patience and used every endeavour towards con ciliation, but to continue such endeavours would now be useless and prejudicial. Ho is fixedly resolved to keep the Hindoo traders out of El Bidaa, and no argument or persuasion will avail to alter his resolve. He has been clearly informed that such con duct will be regarded as unfriendly, and that he will be held directly responsible for the infringement of British rights. “11. I may here point out that this matter of the right of traders to reside at El Bidaa is not one which could well be waived. It is one of considerable importance as regards the Persian Gulf. Jasim has been regarded as an independent Arab Chief within the sphere of British paramount influence, and I need not demonstrate by argument how prejudicial to our just and wholesome influence it would be to suffer Jasim to have his way. Other Chiefs n ight adopt similar tactics, and the position of our trading subjects wauld be endangered at other ports. If, again, El Bidaa were regarded as Turkish territory, our traders would have a right by treaty to reside there.8 “ 12. I much regret that my continued efforts, backed by the ■warning conveyed under authority ot Government to this Sheikh, have failed to bring him to reason on this point, and 1 feel I have no alternative but to recommend that some more active measures may now be taken to redress this state of affairs. If it is still considered advisable, to this end, to deal directly with .Tasim with out reference to Turkish authority, it would be necessary to empower me to enforce redress by the presence and possible action of Her Majesty’s vessels at El Bidaa, and the best time tor such operations would be about the middle of October. It should , be well understood that, in the event of action being so taken, the Turkish flag will be displayed on the forts, buildings, and vessels of El Bidaa&gt; Tho specific demands which Colonel Ross re- • commended should be made on Sheikh Jasim were (1) compensation for losses suffered by British Indian traders through his proceedings ; (2) free admission ot the traders in future; and (3) an apology for bis offensive conduct; failing com pliance, Her Majesty’s ships to be authorized to use such coercion as might he necessary and practicable. Upon receipt of Colonel Ross’s report, the Viceroy telegraphed its purport to the Secretary of State, with a request for immediate orders.* The contingency contemplated in the corre spondence with the Foreign Office during the spring, and provided for in the Secretary of State's Despatch of the 21th March, having occurred, and Sheikh Jasim having acted in defiance of the warning given to him that he “ would certainly he held directly and “ personally responsible for all losses and injuries “ to British subjects,” there seemed to be no alter native hut to sanction the Resident’s proposals. A telegram to that effect, hut directing that, if force had to be used, every effort should be made to avoid actual collision with any Turkish troops at El Bidaa, was accordingly drafted and referred for the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.f The relations of the British Government with that of Turkey in connection with the affairs of Egypt certainly made the moment an inopportune one for operations which would no doubt be regarded by the Sultan as trenching upon his pre rogative. The necessity for them w r as, therefore, accepted with reluctance at the Foreign Office. On the 10th October,J the Viceroy w r as desired by telegraph to take no action until he heard further, and w^as asked what was the latest period to which naval operations could be postponed. His Excellency answered (23rd October) that, though the month of October was the most suitable, operations could be conducted throughout the cold season, and that the Resident thought force would not he necessary, if he had discretion to proceed confidently. On the 4th November,§ after, as is understood, consideration of the matter by the Cabinet, Lord Granville’s concurrence in the telegraphic instruc tions proposed to be sent to the Government of India was intimated in a letter from Sir J. Baunce- fote; and on the 6th November, the telegram, as originally drafted, was despatched. * Telegram from Viceroy, dated 25 th September 1882, No. 612. f To Foreign Office, dated 29th September 1882, No. 612. f Home Correspondence, No. 644 of 1882. § From Foreign Office, 4th November 1882, No. 679.9 * Telegram from Viceroy, dated 9th De cember 1882. No. 749. On the 9th December* a telegram was received from the Viceroy repeating one, dated the 7th idem, from Colonel Uoss, in the following terms :— “ Compliance with terms demanded from Sheikh Jasim exacted without resort to extreme measures. Pecuniary compensation was reduced to Rs. 8,(XK) total, representing very moderately actual losses of traders only. All indirect claims struck out. This sum recovered.” How this result had been brought about was ex plained in papers enclosed in Secret Letter from India, No. 21, dated the 6th February 1883. On the 25th August previous, Sheikh Jasim wrote to Colonel Ross that the affair might be settled the return of the banians,—a proposal which the Resident thought came too late to be accepted, unless on condition of redress being afforded and compensation paid on account of their losses (Enel. 17). Further letters were received from the Sheikh, as to which the Resident wrote to the Government of India on the 11th October (Enel. 18) : “2. I regard the letters of Shaikh Jasim as insincere and un truthful in essential points. It is self-evident that had he been actuated only by a desire to avert the consequences of any injury being done to the Indian traders by Arabs, he would have acted in a very different manner. His assertions are also in some respects so inconsistent with one another, as well as with fact, that he is self-convicted of insincerity. It will be seen that, whilst protesting tint he was only afraid of evil befalling the banians, he also accuses them in a most wild way of misconduct, an accusation which careful inquiry shows to be utterly unfounded. These latest letters of Jasim show no symptom of readiness to afford substantial redress for his conduct, and I am sure that can only be obtained from him with force in reserve. I have there fore merely desired the Native Agent at Bahrein to inform Jasim that I have received his several letters, and that the. views of the Government of India regarding the matters referred to will in du&amp; course be intimated to him.” Colonel Ross at the same time forwarded to Government an amended statement of the banians’ claims, which he had cut down from Rs. 40,759 to Rs. 27,114, including (1) Rs. 10,000, compensation for loss of anticipated profit, (2) Rs. 5,400, for interest on capital during forced suspension of business for 4i months, and (3) Rs. 6,645, on account of debts outstandiug from various persons. Upon receipt of the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 6th November, the Government of India sent the following instructions to Colonel Ross, by telegraph (Enel. 21): “ Your letters and telegrams regarding El Bidaa. Matter has been referred to Her Majesty’s Government, and it has been de cided to deal with Shaikh direct using force if absolutely neces sary. You are now authorized to demand from Shaikh compliance with following terms :—First, payment of compensation for losses improperly inflicted on traders ; second, return of traders to El Bidaa and free admission in future ; third, suitable apology to British Government for their ill treatment and summary ex pulsion. If demand is evaded or refused, you can proceed to El Bidaa with ships of war and take such action as may be necessary. Following instructions should, however, be carefully observed. In writing to Shaikh begin by acknowledging Shaikh’s letter for warded with yours of 3rd October and express satisfaction of Government at offer to permit return of traders, but say offer is late and not of itself sufficient to meet wishes of Viceroy, who re quires terms stated above and guarantee of future friendly behaviour. Your letter should be moderate in tone and claims 9429. C10 for compensation should be reduced as far as possible. Ranians are entitled to protection and to reasonable compensation for clear ill treatment and direct loss, but Government does not desire to support excessive demands or press claims for remote damages. It is thought that considerable reduction might be made in list forwarded with your letter of 11th October, especially in first two items, and it is doubted whether Shaikh can properly be held responsible for third. If display of force becomes necessary, every effort should be made to avoid actual collision with any Turkish troops.” With reference to these instructions, the Foreign Secretary wrote on the 15th November (Enel. 22): “ 3. You have already been informed by my telegram of the 12th of November 1882 that the matter has been submitted to Her Majesty’s Government, and that it has been decided to act upon your recommendation. The instructions conveyed in that telegram are full, and it is unnecessary, to repeat or supplement them in this letter. His Excellency the Viceroy is confident that they will be carried out by you with care and judgment, and that every effort will be made to avoid embarrassing complications and to effect a satisfactory settlement without the use of force. I am, however, directed to add that His Excellency is specially desirous of not committing the British Government to an unreserved sup port of all the claims put forward by the banians. It is notorious that, as a class, they are apt to make immoderate demands and to take advantage of their position as British subjects. Of course they are entitled to protection, and to reasonable compensation when they have clearly been oppressed or maltreated. But even in British territory the Courts of law do not always enforce the claims of such persons to the full, or as a matter of course ; and when they choose for the sake of large profits to incur the risk neces sarily attending trade in uncivilized countries, it is not desirable that the support of the British Government should be accorded to them unreservedly, or without full examination of their claims, in their differences with foreign rulers. The Governor General in Council has no doubt that you will recognize the justice of this view, and that you will be able to avoid any appearance of one- sidednoss in the treatment of Jasim-bin-Thani or of interference with his rights. “ 4. I am to remark, in conclusion, that the present situation may afford you a suitable opportunity of establishing an under standing with the Shaikh, as suggested in Captain Hope’s letter of the 28th April 1882, for the observance, as far as may be possible, of the agreement of 1868.” On the 14th November the Resident addressed the following letter to Shaikh Jasim (Enel. 24):— “ In your letter, dated 10th Shawal, you informed me that the banians might return to El Bidaa if 1 desired it. I am desired to express the satisfaction of Government at that offer, but to point out that, as the time for the trading operations of their Indian subjects was past, the offer came too late to benefit them, and as their expulsion from El Bidaa has inflicted considerable loss on them, this offer is not in itself sufficient to meet the wishes of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India, who requires the terms which 1 proceed to explain :— “ 1st. Payment of fair compensation for losses sustained by the British Indian subjects through their summary expulsion from your territory. “2nd. That you shall arrange for the return of these traders to El Bidaa and for their free admission in future and good treatment such as is accorded by, and expected from, all friendly Chiefs. “3rd. That you will express through me to the Government of India your apology for the harsh treatment experienced by their subjects at your hands, and for their summary expulsion from your territory. “In making those demands lean assure you that the British Government is only actuated by the intention of upholding the just rights of their subjects, and is at the same time desirous that the friendly relations so long subsisting between your ancestors and the Government should continue. But I must also assure you that the resolutions of Government, which are moderate and11 just, are firm, and any evasion or refusal of those demands would lead to consequences which I, as your friend, would deplore. “ It has been my constant end and endeavour to draw closer the friendly relations between us, both from the respect I had for your father, and also from the personal friendship established between us when I visited your camp at Zobarah, a friendship which I had hoped to improve. But you will recollect that several months ago I informed yon that ill treatment and ex pulsion of British Indian subjects from your country would be acts inconsistent with friendly relations. By all friendly Govern ments and Chiefs all over the world British traders are allowed to come and go and ply their trades in their territories, and receive due protection. I sent an agent to explain all this personally to you, and I was greatly surprised to learn that you had not heeded my warning and treated my agent with want of courtesy. If the banians interfere with your own mercantile dealings, you cannot expect the British Government to consider that an excuse for expelling them, or refusing them admission, for the Government regards you as the Chief and Governor of El Bidaa, not as a trader. Any reasonable expenses for protection of the banians will not be resisted, but must be with my approval, and not liable to be exceeded without.” This letter was sent by the hands of a certain Agha Mahomed Rahim,—a person well known to the Sheikh,—with instructions to explain the de tails of the pecuniary demands, which were reduced to Rs. 8,049, none but claims for direct and actual losses of the Hindus being included. The upshot of the discussions between Muhammad Rahim and Sheikh Jasim was, that the Sheikh had no objection to apologize, was willing to receive back the banians, though on unfavourable terms, but refused to pay compensation unless the banians returned and proved their case (Enel. 27). In course of conversation, Jasim remarked : “ If “ pressure and force is used against me, I shall be obliged to embark with 10,000 men and go to “ Bahrein and kill all the banians, kill you, and “ any one I want in Bahreinand the Agent having observed, “ You have dreamt that you have “ become Arabi Pasha the second,” he replied, “ I am two Arabis ! ” and went away. Consequent on the failure of Muhammad Rahim s mission, the Resident, with Her Majesty’s ships “ Woodlark ” and “Arab,” proceeded to El Bidaa, where he arrived on the 1st November. On the appearance of Her Majesty’s ships, the Turkish flag was hoisted on Jasim’s house and the Turkish Residency. On anchoring, Colonel Ross sent a letter to the Sheikh, couched in very conciliatory language, but insisting on payment forthwith of the condensation demanded, and on a guarantee of friendly and kind treatment of the banians in future. The subsequent proceedings may best be given in the words of Colonel Ross’s letter of 7th De cember 1882 (Enel. 28) :— “ Sheikli Jasim sent off Sheikh. Ali-bin-Rashid, Chief of El Wakrah, with his reply, and a verbal message to the effect that Jasim was desirous of seeing me on shore. Sheikh Ali-bin- Rashid informed me that he was of opinion that my visiting Sheikh Jasim in a friendly way would make it easy for him to concede to our demands, but that otherwise Sheikh Jasim was so eccentric in his character that he might possibly mount his camel and go away. It appeared to me that the best chance of an amicable settlement lay in my landing and seeing Jasim, and I therefore decided to do so. It is usual for the Sheikhs of town-ships to visit the Resident on board, but I was quite sure that Jasim’s suspicious disposition would not allow ot his coming on ^ “ () n the 3rd instant Captain Neasham and I, and Mr. A. R. Hakim, Khan Bahadur, landed and proceeded to Jasim’s house, and he'received us with politeness and apparent cordiality. After some conversation on general topics we adjourned to an upper room and entered on the subject of the complaints against the Sheikh. He asked me if I would have patience to hear all that he had to say, and I told him that was my wish and intention. He said that, after my hearing his explanation, he would act as I decided. There was, however, nothing in his statement which placed his conduct in a more favourable light. lie simply re peated Ids assertions that he had not summarily ejected the banians, and was in no way responsible for their losses. After hearing all he had to say, 1 informed him that I saw no reason to alter my opinion as to his culpability, and hoped ho would settle the matter in a friendly way by paying the very moderate com pensation demanded. I then, finding he was quite obstinate on this point, said I was very sorry, but as there was no more to be said we would take leave. Sheikh Jasim then requested me to wait whilst he said prayers, and hear what his Wazir Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahhftb had to say. This person has been an evil counsellor to Jasim, and is partly responsible for the unpleasantness which has had place. lie proposed some very reduced terms, and I went on board with Captain Neasham, leaving the Native Assistant and Munshi with Jasim. In the evening of that day Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahhab came off, and after some discussion offered to pay Rs. 2,000 in cash, and find securities for payment of the balance of our demand. Con sidering the wealth of both Sheikh Jasim and his Wazir, this appeared to me unnecessary trifling, but, in my desire to make matters as easy as possible, I informed Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahhab that if he brought Rs. 2,000 as earnest money next morning, and would furnish satisfactory security, I would accept that arrangement. At the same time, I gave him distinctly to understand that unless he brought the money on board at the stated time I would revert to the demand for full payment in cash.” Oil tlie morning of the 4th, Abdul Wahhab came off, but without the money, and Colonel Ross was therefore obliged to change his tone and resort to a threat of forcible measures, conveyed in the following notice to Jasim :— “ After compliments.—Having failed to obtain compliance with the demands of the British Government, I have to notify that I have put the matter in the hands of the oflicer in command of Her Majesty’s ships of war, and that, unless the sum of Rs. 8,000 is on board by one hour after midday this day, Her Majesty’s ships will open fire on your fort. Therefore you are requested to remove any woman and unarmed persons by that time.” This had the desired effect, and the money was promptly sent on hoard. Her Majesty’s ships had in the interval taken up commanding positions and prepared for action. The result was never for a moment doubtful in Colonel Ross’s mind, as he was quite aware that there was no real difficulty in producing even a very much larger sum than that required. The Wazir Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahhab brought the money himself, and Colonel Ross sent the Native Assistant and Munshi on shore with him to arrange for the fulfilment of the other terms! On taking leave he observed a change for the better in the tone of the Wazir, who asked earnestly if he was now forgiven. Colonel Ross replied that now we considered byegones to be byegones, and he would for the future be regarded according to his own future conduct.13 The Native Assistant having handed Jasim a receipt for the indemnity, obtained from him the following letter in satisfaction of the demand for an apology and a guarantee of future good treatment of the banians :— Aftci compliments. Ity your arrival I was sure you would accept my apology when it has become certain to you that I did not expel them suddenly, and that I in the end wanted them to remain in the place; and that they left the place of their own ac cord When you demanded this amount of Rs. 8,000, and com pelled me to pay it, I did so, and please God you will excuse me tor what has taken place between us in regard to correspondence on the subject. “ Please God you will submit my reply to Her Majesty’s Go vernment of India, that I will not commit any acts against their wishes. In regard to the banians, if I continue in this place as before, they will be in safety as they were before, but if I do not remain in this place and remove to some other place, I beg to be excused in the matter ; and whoever shall be the Chief in the place, he shall certainly give them the required protection.” During his stay at El Bidaa, Colonel Ross had no official communication with any Turkish officer or authority. Several of the Turkish soldiers came on hoard for medical treatment, and, he heard, they held a very had opinion of Jasim, and expressed a hope he would he well punished. As to Jasim, the Resident himself wrote :— “Sheikh Jasim-bin-Muhammad-Thani is the most impracticable Arab I have ever had to deal with. He is untruthful, untrust worthy, arrogant, avaricious, and miserly, and these qualities blind him to his true interests, as is seen in his whole career. It would r tlling f ° r if *1® wer ® to lose his position of Sheikh p , ^^ aa ’ ^ d° n °t think there is any immediate prospect of that occurring.” 1 * To India; Secret, No. 6, dated 9th March 1883. f From Foreign Office, 1st March 1883.

The Government of India, in communicating to Colonel Ross their approval of his proceeding's, expressed their appreciation of the “ tact, patience,' and ability ” displayed by him during the course of •the affair (Enel. 29), and the Secretary of State, on the part of Her Majesty’s Government, intimated his full concurrence in this commendation. ¥ As was to be expected, these transactions did not pass without notice from the Turkish Government. On the 10th February 1883, Her Majesty’s Chargi d’Affaires at Constantinople received a “ Note Verbale from the Porte, based upon a report from the Governor General of the Vilayet of Baghdad, protesting against Colonel Ross’s proceedings as contrary to international law, and calling for a refund of the indemnity exacted from ° Sheikh Jasim, who was styled “ Sous-Gouverneur ” of Katr. A communication in the same sense was made to Lord Granville by the Turkish Ambassador in London.f It being, in Lord Granville’s opinion, which was concurred in by Lord Kimberley, J desirable to avoid discussion of the subject, whether in Constantinople or London, it was decided to make no written replies to these communications, but, if necessary, to inform both the Porte and the Ambassador verbally that “ Her Majesty’s Government must decline to admit “ the Turkish claim of sovereignty over El Bidaa.” $ 9429. d14 Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople was instructed accordingly.* But the Turkish Government persisting in its complaint, a formal reply on the part of Lord. Granville to the communications received from Musurus Pasha became requisite, and was finally (7tli May 1883) made in the following terms :—+ “I have the honour to explain to your Excellency that these proceedings were rendered necessary by the Sheikh’s complete disregard of the representations made to him by the British autho rities in consequence of his treatment of certain British Indian traders residing at El Bidaa, whom he eventually ejected in a sudden and violent manner, thereby subjecting them to very serious losses in their trade. “ The Sheikh had been warned that he would be held directly responsible for any act inconsistent with the friendly ielutions which had hitherto existed between him and the British autho rities, and Her Majesty’s Government accordingly authorized a demonstration of force in the event of his refusing to pay the moderate esmpeusation which was claimed from him for the injuries inflicted on British subjects, whose right to reside at El Bidaa it was impossible for Her Majesty’s Government to abandon. . “ It is to be regretted that this attitude of defiance assumed by the Sheikh should have compelled Her Majesty’s Government to adopt measures which they would willingly have avoided, and which were only resorted to when their agents had exhausted every effort to obtain redress by other means. ^ « i n conclusion, I beg leave to remind your Excellency that the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Katr coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty's Government. On the 2nd August, Musurus Pasha, under in structions from the Porte, replied to this note in terms which reasserted the Sultan’s sovereignty over the coast in question in the most uncom promising manner.t His Excellency wrote : “ En ce qui concerne le dernier paragraphe de la lettre precitee de Votre Excellence, la Sublime Porte m’a autorise a declarer en reponse d’une maniere explicite et categorique, que la Souyerainete du Sa Majeste Imperial le Sultan est parfaitement 6tablie sur les contrees de Nejd dont depend le Caimakamat de Katr. “ En effet, le vilayet de la province de Nejd et de son littoral a fait de tout temps, et 'fait actuellement, partie integrante et reelle de 1’Empire Ottoman ; il est occupe par une partie de I’armee Im- periale, et il y existe une Administration legaleraent constituee sous laquelle les populations indigenes vivent heureuses, contentes, et en pleine paix. Le Gouvernement Imperial ne doute point que le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste la Reine ne veuille bien faire a cette declaration un accueil conforme aux principes du droit des gens et aux rapports d’amitie existant entre les deux Empires.” • Lord Granville to Mr. Wyndham, No. 107, dated 31st March 1883.

Desiring to return for the purpose of recovering debts owing to them, they appealed to the Resident in the Gulf, who on the 9th July 1883, wrote as follows to Sheikh Jasim:— “ The first object in writing this friendly letter is to inquire regarding your health and welfare, after which I beg to request a your good offices and kindness to snch of the subjects of the British Government as may wish to go to your country in pursuit of their trade, and that you will kindly give them the customary assistance and protection which we expect from the friendly rela tions between you and the British Government, as well as the agreement subsisting between us. Hoping you will always inform me of your welfare. With salaam.” To this the Sheikh replied :— “lour letter, dated 3rd Ramazan, has reached me. I have rejoiced at the news of your good health, and understood all you have written. \ou have especially enjoined me to give my friendly protection to the subjects of the Imperial Government. I shall not neglect anything in my power, but I beg to inform you that this town is subject to the Ottoman Government. I myself have resigned the office of Kaim-makam, and the affairs of the place are in abeyance, as the Government has not yet appointed a Governor on its part. So whoever wished to return here has come of his own pleasure and the same with those who stay away. hile I am here my efforts shall be given to protect the subjects of the Imperial Government as much as possible. Pray keep me informed of your news.” Along the Arab coast, generally, tranquillity has of late been fairly well preserved, though on the 2nd June last a boat belonging to Bahrain was attacked and plundered by Beni-Hajir Bedouins, under the leadership of the old olfender, Zaid-bin- Muhammad. In reference to this affair, Colonel Ross wrote to the Government of India (14th June Secret, No. 92, dated 3rd 1883) :—* “ As on former occasions the robbers, who are not themselves seafaring people and possess no boats of their own, seized on a boat they found near shore, in the vicinity of Katif, and put to sea in search of booty. Meeting a vessel belonging to Bahrain they plundered it, shooting the Nacoda, who afterwards died of the wound. “ The tactics of the Beni-Hajir preclude as a rule the possibility of any effective action being taken against them by Her Majesty’s ships of war, as they have no vessels of their own, no habitations by the sea, and they act in shallow waters, usually when they know the coast is clear. It is only possible to suppress the Beni- Hajir robbers by action on land, and as their depredations are committed from districts under Turkish occupation, the Turkish Government are responsible in the matter. The notorious Zaeed- bin-Muhammad has for five years enjoyed entire impunity whilst conducting his nefarious operations, and it is probable that unless redi ess is exacted from the lurkish Government, the same state of affairs will continue.” The Sheikh of Bahrain complained to the Resi dent in strong terms of the risks to which his people, engaged in peaceful trade, were exposed when they approached the coast of Katif and its neighbourhood, and, both in writing and upon occasion of a visit to Colonel Ross at Bushire, ex- piessed his desire to be allowed to act himself Secret, No. 148, dated 4th against the piratical tribest on the mainland as well as at sea. He was informed that it would be impossible to countenance such measures, which Mould be resented by the Turkish Government, and16 'would besides be probably quite abortive and lead to worse disorder than already existed. The papers when received from India were for- warded to the Foreign Office, and thence to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, who ad dressed' the Turkish Government on the subject. He, as usual, received a reply to the eflect that the facts were not as stated; but, consequent on a fresli representation, further inquiry was promised. The local authorities having, however, in the mean time recovered and returned to Bahrain four of the slaves who had been carried off,* and it being * From India ; Secret, No. 126, dated 1st thought undesirable to raise the question of Turkish °ctober 1883. sovereignty over the coast, Lord Dufferin has been instructed to let the matter drop.f t From Foreign Office, 16th and 28th A.
