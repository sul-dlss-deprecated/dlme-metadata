Aden, March 22nd, 1911. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on measures taken during your absence from Aden for the prevention of the illicit landing of arms within the p Aden protectorate. 2. On receipt of Government of India's telegram on the 7th instant, sanctioning the line of action proposed in your telegram of the 4rth instant, I communicated with Capt. Marshall, R.N., of fi.M.3. 'Proserpine' and as no suitable launch was available, I arranged for the hire of a dhow. 3. Several dhows were inspected but none then in harbour was found sufficiently strong to take a 3-pounder gun in the bows. Finally one was selected and it was decided that the Proserpine's carpenter should strengthen her forward deck and make some other minor improvements. The hire of this dhow with native crew was arranged at Rs.400 per mensem, of which half a month has been paid in advance. 4. The alterations were expected to take three days, and,and, as our iniormation showed that the dhows with arms might sail ifrom Djibouti at any moment, X borrowed a cutter from the R.I.M.S, D&amp;lhousie and sent her on the I 10th instant to cruise ott Kae-al-Ara. This cutter was eventually relieved by the armed dhow and returned to Aden on the 14th instant• 5. ihe armed dhow leit Aden on the morning of the 13th instant in command of Lieut, Sresson, K,U., with a 3-pounder hotchkiss, a maxim and small arms. She had her native crew and also six blue jackets from the Proserpine and an officer from the Dalhousie whose services had been lent under sanction obtained by wire from the Director, 6. On the 14th instant, x received information that a dhow with arms had sailed the previous afternoon from Djibouti and it was anticipated that she would make for Kas-al-Ara, X telegraphed to the Assistant Resident at Perim to notify Lieut, Gresson. 7. I attach herewith Lieut, Gresson's report which shows that he arrived off Ras-al-Ara on the morning of the 15th and saw a crowd of men and eamels who waved to them under the apparent supposition that they were the dhow with arms that was expected, xt was then blowing hard(3 hard and nothing could have been landed. 8. On the iollowing day Lieut. Greeaon boarded and searched lour dhows without result. 9. On the morning ol the 17th he sighted a dhow close in land, and, on approaching, wae met with a heavy lire from the crew which had landed - the arms and ammunition were also on the shore and in spite oi lieut. Sresso^s eiiorts the Arabs succeeded in getting them away though doubtless some oi them must have been damaged by the lire irom the armed dhow. Lieut, treason iired at them until his 3-pounder ammunition was exhausted and then having one man badly wounded in the thigh he returned to Perim. The wounded man was there attended by ur. Spence and brought to Aden by the Lalhousie on the 20th instant: he is now in the European General Hospital and progressing as well as oan be expected. 10* ijrom inlormatioa received irom Djibouti I estimate tnac there were about 700 riifles and 80 oases oi ammunition in the consignment landed. Had the dhow been sighted by Lieut, treason beiore they had got on shore he would in all probability have succeeded in capturing the lot, and it was a piece oi bad lick that he did not come up with her(5 her until too late to prevent the landing* 11* Lieut. Grresson has asited ior more ammunition and proposes to continue cruising in the neighbourhood, but, as no 3-pounder hotchkiss ammunition is available in Aden pending arrival At the Proserpine, I have wired to Pvrim instructing him to return here. 1 have also directed him to endeavour to bring with him the dhow which landed the arms or, if she is too much damaged to iloat, to burn her where she lies. 12. in spite oi the Arabs having succeeded in talcing the arms away i venture to think that this encounter will have a good deterrent effect as regards gun-running, but I also beg leave to point out that, ii the services of a launch such as the 'General Allis' or the 'Dolphin' could be obtained, measures could then be taken which would probably put a stop to the practice entirely as regards the coast line between here and Perim.

We arrived at Ras-al-Ara at 8-10 a.m. 15th, and were within i mile of shore where we saw a crowd of men and camels, who came to the shore and waved to us evident ly assuming that we were the dhow which they were expect ing. We remained there for the day, it was blowing so hard from the West that nothing could have possibly been landed. 16th. Oot under weigh at 8 a.m. on seeing two dhows approaching, chased one dhow, fired one round of blank followed by 6 shotted rounds before she would heave to, the other dhow followed up. i*he name of the nakhuda of the dhow was from Bukran for Aden cargo dried fish; she was searched thoroughly and found nothing. The second was of the same nature. The wind and sea increased and so ran towards has Bander for shelter.

East of Has El Ara closed her under sail, wind very light. ^en we got to within 500 the crew of dhow, who had climed to the top of the cliff, fired volleys at us, cleared away 3 pounder and Maxim and returned their lire with these and rifle. Wind dropped altogether, our distance from the dhow being then about 400 yards. Saw on shore near dhow what appeared to be a shelter made from branches in which were bundles looking like arms and ammunition. Dropped anchor to keen broadside on to shore, people on shore kept up a heavy fire, but shots were nearly all falling short. Shelled dhow and bundle of rifles. Still no wind, enemy's fire practically ceased. intended to close shore; but had no means of doing so. Shortly after this perceived many camels and men coming from both East and West, enemy now numbered about 60, I lir.d at them ae they approached. The eneay lined the olifjclili some little way inland and were ^uite invisible irom onr position and opened a very heavy lire on us, making most excellent shooting, shots penetrating hull and wounding, iirst a native (superiioial would), second ly myseli slightly with a spent bullet, and finally signal boy Cross R.U. who was in the hold of the dhow passing up ammunition to 3-pounder« he was hit through both thighs and bone of the left thigh fractured. As I considered that I had no chance of capturing either the dhow or the arms, no object could be gained by remaining under such a hot fire, I decided to haul further out and wait until they tried to move the arms, and shell them with 3-pounder and maxim. Fortunately two of the native crew were able to dive which they very pluckily did, lifting the anchor and hauling us tut very slowly till we came 1000 off shore. when enemy tried to remove rifles we shelled them with remainder of 3-pounaer and opened fire with maxim and rifle; could not say what casualties were inflicted by our fire, but we were unable to prevent them hauling the bundles wa- away up the gully, and putting them on camels when they made off inland. fhe action commenced at 7-45 a.m. and lasted till 6-30 p.m. I then made sail at 7-30 p.m. as soon&lt;^5 soon as there was sufficient wind and made for open sea, intending to get wounded man put on hoard steamer hound for Aden. At 8-45 p.m. called up steamer by lamp and rochets; they replied butfeould get nothing comprehensible out of them; closed iirenoh Mail at IS m.n. and then proceeded to Perim. Wind very light and only arrived at Perim at 3 p.m. 18th where Gross was landed for treatment, and taken to Dr. Spence’s bungalow and will be forwarded by Dalhousie Sunday night. My original orders were to be baok at Aden on the 23rd but after the occurrence of this action I would suggest that it would be detrimental in the interests of stopping this illicit traffic to withdraw from the coast or cease patrolling for some time. There are 1 understand two more dhows expected from Djibouti and they will be distinctly encouraged by their success on the 17th. I would suggest that 50 rounds of 3-pounder ammunition should be forwarded per s.s.

Sir, I have the honour to report that: whilst cruising off the coast near Has al Ara, at 7,45 am on March the 17th, a Dhow was sighted close inshore about S miles East of Has al Ara: I closed her under sail, the wind being very light, and found that she was ashore. of the Dhow, who had climbed to the top of the cliff, which is here about 50ft. high, commenced firing volleys at us: I cleared away the 3 pdr, and Maxim and returned their fire with these and rifles: when we were about 400 yds. from fv the Dhow the wind died away altogether, and I anchored in order to keep her broadside to the shore, meantime the fire from the shore was maintained, but nearly all shot were falling short. to be a shelter built of branches and containing bundles of Rifles and ammunition, and proceeded to shell this with the 3 pdr. endeavoured to close the Dhow, but in the absence of wind was unable to do so. When we got to within 500 yds. of her, the crew I observed on shore near the Dhow, what appeared The fire from shore now practically ceased, and I Shortly after this I observed parties of men with numerous camels approaching from both sides, and bringing2 . (3 bringing the total nunber of the enemy up to about 60: I opened fire on them as they approached but was unable to - prevent them lining the cliff, some liHle way inland, from which positiro they were able, while themselves remaining invisible, to open a heavy fire on us, making most excellent shooting, wounding, first a native ( superficial wound ), secondly myself ( slightly with a spent bullet ),' and finally signal boy Oross (ON ), who was in the hold at the time passing up ammunition to the 3 pdr. , the sides of the Dhow offering no protection: Gross was hit through both thighs, the bone of the left thigh being fractured. As I considered that I had no chance of capturing either the Dhow or the arms, and no object could be gained by remaining under such a hot fire, I decided to haul further out and wait until they tried to remove the arms and then shell them with the 3 pdr. and . maxim. Fortunately two of the native crew were able to dive and very pluckily did so, lifting the anchor and hauling us out until we were some 1000 yds. from the shore. When the enemy tried to remove the rifles, we opened on them with the remainder of the 3 pdr., Maxim and rifle: I cannot say what casualities were inflicted “Kjour fire, but we were unable to prevent them removing the arms and ammunition, which they dragged up a galley, placed on Camels, and then made off inland with. The action commenced at 7.45 am and lasted until 6.30 pm, and I made sail as soon as there was sufficient wind (about 7.30 pm) with the intention of catching the Perim-Aden mail steamer and putting the wounded man on board her, but this I failed to do so took himJ. n him to Perim where I arrived at at 3 pm on the 18th, and Cross was at onee removed to Dr. Spence f s Bungalow on treatment^ and will be sent to Aden in the Dalhousie.

Forwarded, submitting for your consideration, that Lieutenant Gresson appears to have acted with great discretion, and that considering the force he had under his command and the number and position of the enemy, he did everything in his power to effect the capture of the Dhow, arms and ammunition. And observing that, though the reports have been numerous and conflicting, it appears to be certain +hat at least one of the enemy was killed (a man named Mahomed whose cousin is in Aden and deposes to his death) and probably another, and two or three wounded: and that most reports agree that about 270 rifles out of the 300 and nost of the ammunition, were' destroyed by gun fire. ce Commander in Chief, H. M. Ships and Vessels, East Indies Station. (sgd) U,J.T.Marshall. Commander and S. N, 0. Aden Division.In continuation of my report dated 1.9th March I I have the honour to forward the following report of my proceedings in the Armed Dhow until she was paid off today. Ordinary Signalman Sydney J. Cross was sent to Aden in the R. I. M. S. Dalhousie on the 19th March, On the 21st I received the Residents telegram ordering me to Aden for ammunition, but as it was blowing very strong from the S. S, I could not proceed. The ammunition was eventually sent per S,S, Maynn arriving on the 22nd March. We put to sea at noon getting a tow f ri om one of the Company's Launches, made very little headway and anchored off Satiah for the night. I cruised on the coast from the 22nd to the 2 7 th, made three attempts to get to Dhow, but I every time we got up to her there was far too big a sea running to attempt to land. I did not fire at her as I • I considered that the firing would be very erratic and not worth the waste of ammunition. The Dhow was high and dry on the beach and apparently abandoned and I saw no signs of any natives in the vicinity. Our 3 pdr. mounting worked loose on the 27th and I decided to return to Perim to get it secured and to get news. On arrival at Perim I received a wire re two Dhows leaving Djibouti. I got towed out at 9pm. by S.S. Maynn as far as Brothers. We made sail at midnight but wind was light and by daylight we had made only 7 miles when, we sighted H.M.S.'PROSERPINE” who took us in tow and proceeded as far as Ras al Ara. cast offtow from 'PROSERPINE' at 1 pm. and was going to patrol coast but the NaJckoda complained with the leakage. I examined her , carefully and there was undoubtedly a serious leakage occurring H.M.S.'PROSERPINE”. &amp;Trr. £A/. vtfVv £occurring in several places so having obtained permission from the Proserpine to proceed to Perim I did so to have her caulked . We arrived at 6pm. and immediately got towed over to Maynn village where the gun,stores, ballast etc. were taken out of her and the Dhow beached. Captain Waller v very kindly gave a small shed up for the/%e of our seamen where they were quite comfortable. Caulking was started in the morning of the 25th as soon as the tide allowed and was finished by the 30th at 8.0 pm. The Dhow's bottom was thoroughly scraped and caulked and a coat of tar put on. The stores etc. were replaced the same night and on the morning of the 31st I put to sea to proceed to Aden but was driven to leeward and after beating all day I just managed to ; make the harbour again where I anchored in Quarantine Bay. I madeanother attempt in the early morning but could make no headway on account of very heavy sea so returned to harbour and telegraphed to Aden. The wind continued;to blow hard from the S.E. until the 3rd April when it abated a bit and I tried to proceed at 3.0 am. but the halliards of the foresail carried away and I had to wait until morning to get some new rope which the Nakkoda said he would pay for. I proceeded at noon, getting a tow to the mouth of the harbour, but after beating again until 7.0 pm. I only fetched up in Quarantine Bay , where I anchored until 4.0. am. on 4th April when I again proceeded . This time we made better weather of it and I eventually arrived at Aden on the night of 6th April at 9.0. pm. On passing Has Kan I saw a dhow close inshore anchored . She was flying a flag but I could not make out what it was . On approaching her they hauled down their flag which turned out to be only a 10m cloth. The Dhow's name was Haschmia, Nakkoda Said Ahmed. Thei: ^ i wtimm L. ( V The manifest from Djibouti said she sailed with a general cargo,but the Nakkoda himself said he had only 7 bags of dried fish on board. His destination was supposed to be Zeila but he t never went there but to Zad ad din wher he dropped his cargo and took a cargo of lime stone for Aden. His answer did not sci seem to, agree with what should have taken place so I made him get under way and proceed to Aden. Before closing my report I should like to mention the great assistance Sub Lieutenant Boykett gave me while h6 was in the dhow, especially on the day when we had 01 ,: our action . He controlled the rifle fire from the well of the dhow, and kept perfectly cool the whole time, and during the short time I was knocked out he took over command. I should also like to mention the great assistance V the Manager of the Perim Coal Company gave me on all occasions. He gave us a launch whenever we required one, and did everything in his power to helpr expedite repairs etc. I have the honour to be etc. A.L.GRESSON.

The Government of Hie i.-lajesty have received from the Government of the French Republic, in accordance witr the agroemontB which have been arrived at, the blank forms of the M authorisation a naviguer' and the 'titre de naviration” which the French Authorities are issuing to KuBcat and Zanzibar dhows which have been M francises M and which habitually navigate along the coast of Italian Somaliland. In so far as the n francisation n of the uscat and Z nzibar dhows is concerned, the Government of His rajas- i ty consider that this right cannot be put in question. As regards tha declaration made by Monsieur Pichon respecting the inutility of verifying the flags of the dhows comprised in the lists, the Government of His Majesty have pointed out to the French Government that the exchange of lists is based on Article 6 of the Arms Traffic Agreement of December 13th 1906, according to which France clearly undertook, as a matter of reciproc ity, that the measures of supervision applied by the local Authorities in Italian and British territorial waterswaters to Italian and British dhows should ho equally applicable, in British and Italian territorial waters, to dhows flying the French flag. Now among the measures of supervision is included that of the enquiry as to the flag, and this can in no way be replaced by the exchange of lists, which is merely a measure to facilitate veri fication. In fact, while on the score of right there can be no doubt on this point,it cannot on the other hand be denied that a dliow may wrongfully assume, at tho sana time as the flag, the outward appearance (names and particulars given in the lists) of another dhow mentioned in these lists; j,nd it is desirable, precisely for this reason, to proceed to an enquiry as to the flag in suspect cases, at the same time as to the examination of the more authentic and more certain elements which may be established through tho verification of the ship’ papers. Hie exchange of the blank forms, proposed by the Government of Hie Majesty will enable men-of-war to i carry out more easily the formality, the delicate nature of which ia fully recognised by the Italian Government,of proceeding to a verification of the flag, both in territorial waters, as contemplated in the agreement of 1906, and on the high seas, in the sense of the S Instructions agreed upon on November 15th 190? . &lt;r° • i ^ ')&lt;Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately unth the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

No reply appears to be necessary, but I may state, for your own information, that His Majesty’s Government are at present considering whether a farther effort should not be made to induce the French Government to withdraw their protection from the arms trsffic at Muscat, and the moment is therefore not opportune for opening negotiations of the nature suggested by Rifaat Pasha. With regard to the question of the Persian Gulf, if and when it comes up for discussion, it will be necessary to convince the Sublime Porte of our anxiety to see the traffic in arms stopped, hut I am of opinion that co-operation with it would probably be embarrassing, and, on the receipt of Sir G.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 3, 1911.) (No. 942.) Sir, x Pera, December 29, 1910. IN speaking yesterday of the recent Italian incident at Hodeidah the Minister for Noreign Affairs expatiated to me at some length on the prevalence of arms smuggling in the Red Sea, and asked if it would not be possible for some arrangement to be reached between Italy, Turkey, France, and Great Britain to check it. He was aware that France had raised difficulties at the Brussels Conference which had practically resulted in the breakdown of the negotiations, but he hoped that some arrangement affecting the Red Sea only might be concluded, and he was instructing Tewfik Pasha to sound you on the subject. I said that I was very imperfectly acquainted with what had occurred at Brussels, but, if I remembered rightly, one point to which France had raised objections was the inclusion of her North African possessions in the scope of the conference; I was sure that whatever proposals the Porte might now put forward would be considered in a friendly spirit by His Majesty’s Government, who held strong views on the necessity of suppressing the illicit trade in arms. In this connection I may mention that a few days ago the “ Tanin ” published an extract from the reports of Ismail Hakki Bey Babanzade, the deputy who was sent to furnish the Government with information of the condition of affairs in the Mesopotamian vilayets, dwelling on the necessity of suppressing the illicit trade in arms in the Persian Gulf, and when Rifaat Pasha mentioned to me the wish of his Government to obtain our co-operation in putting down the traffic in the Red Sea it occurred to me that the opportunity might be utilised to invite the Porte to come to an understanding with us on the same question in the Gulf. Recollecting, howevey, the anti-English tone of Ismail Hakki’s report (enclosed in my despatch No. 939*of the 28th instant), which will have great weight with the Government, and which will, moreover, indubitably confirm the Committee of Union and Progress in its anti- British policy, I thought it better to say nothing to Rifaat Pasha, and a further instalment oi Ismail Hakki’s report, translation of which, taken from the “Jeune Turc ” of to-day, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, confirms me in the belief that it would be inopportune to bring up the question as regards the Persian Gulf for the present.

I HAVE to inform you that the Italian Embassy has drawn my attention to a statement in the “ Times ” that Japanese arms had been consigned to Jibuti.

[45769] No. 1. Sir C. MacDonald to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 19.) (No. 264) Sir, Tokyo, December 2, 1910. A FEW days ago I noticed a telegram in one of the local papers from the “Times,” to the effect that discarded Japanese rifles were about to be, or had been, exported in considerable numbers to Afghanistan and South Africa via the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The “Times” thought that it would be well that the facts 'should be enquired into. The Italian Ambassador came to see me about this matter, and pointed out the danger or possibility of some of these arms finding their way into Italian or British Somaliland through Jibuti. I said that I had already spoken to the Japanese Foreign Office on the subject, but that Mr. Ishii, the Vice-Minister, was unsatisfactory, and did not seem to be able to take any responsibility. He would be very grateful if I would take an opportunity of mentioning the matter at the Japanese Foreign Office, as the matter also affects British interests. I took the first opportunity I had of seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to refer to the reported shipment of arms in considerabe quantities to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, where such shipments were very undesirable in our eyes, and might be a source of danger. On his Excellency remarking that the shipments in question were in the ordinary course of trade, and that if the Japanese did not ship arms the subjects of other countries would, I reminded Count Komura of the trouble connected with the “ Tatsu-Maru ” case, when cargo of arms was shipped to Macao but after wards found its way into China. In discussing this incident with his Excellency at the time he had said that had the Chinese Government mentioned then that the arms were possibly destined for China the Japanese Government would most probably have taken steps to stop them leaving Japan. I now, on behalf of my Government, begged to draw his attention to the fact that these arms were being shipped, their probable destination being either British territory or British-protected territory. Count Komura said that he would make enquiries, and, if necessary, take steps to stop the consignment in question. I have, &amp;c. claude m. Macdonald.

Italian Ambassador to Foreign Office. q. London, 11 ’ 10th January 1910. In inj note of loth October .1909, I had the honour, under instructions from my Government, to propose to you that, with a view to the execution of Article 6 of the agreement of 13th December 1906 le atn e to the arms traffic, the three contracting Powers should reciprocally communicate to one another the forms of the acts of nationality of the dhows flying their respective flags, instead of the annual lists of the dhows themselves. The British Government agreed to this proposal, as you informed me in your note of 7th January 1909, and m a note addressed to Count de Bosdari dated 3rd April last they expressed their intention of modelling their forms as far as possible upon the type^ of those which are issued by the Italian authorities, and winch had, in the meantime, been communicated to the British Government. I he Italian Government then endeavoured to secure a similar adhesion on the part of the French Government ; and the latter, after some negotiation, also accepted the Italian proposal, but modified it in the sense that the reciprocal communication of the forms should not take the place of that of the annual lists, but should be made supple mentary to the latter formality, which would facilitate the task of fixing the nationality of dhows in the event of their names not figuring on the lists. The Italian Government, having agreed in their turn to this modifi cation, have instructed me to inform you of the fact, and to ask you to be good enough to let me know whether the British Government are also prepared to accept it, in order that steps may be taken to exchano- e the forms with the Government of the French Republic.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to transmit to you, for the information of Secretary Sir Edward Grey, with reference to the letter from the Colonial Office of the 20th August, copy of a despatch (with enclosure) to the Admiralty on the subject of the arms traffic between Somaliland and the Arabian littoral.

I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Harcourt to transmit to you, for the consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the accompanying copy of a despatch from the officer administering the Government of Somaliland reporting that there has been a strong revival of the illicit arms trade between the Arabian littoral and the coast of that protectorate. 2. Mr. Harcourt entirely concurs in what is stated in the first part of the last paragraph of Mr. Byatt’s despatch, and, in view of the great importance of preventing as far as possible arms from reaching the Mullah at the present juncture, he trusts that the Lords Commissioners will see their way to detailing a cruiser, as suggested by the acting commissioner. I am, &amp;c. G. Y. EIDDES. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Acting Commissioner Byatt to the Earl of Creive. (Confidential.) My Lord, Commissioner s Office, Berbera, November 4, 1910. I HAVE the honour to report that during the past two months there has been a strong revival of the illicit arms trade between the Arabian littoral and the coast of this protectorate. The seizure of the dhow referred to in paragraph 3 of my confidential despatch of the 13th July had a temporary effect in discouraging this traffic, but the example in that instance does not appear to have been sufficient to stop illegal imports for a very long period. 2. Two or three cases of arms being landed on the coast have latterly come to my knowledge, but the information was received too late to enable any effective interference to be made. I am glad, however, to be able to report that within the past ten days efforts at repression have been more successful. In September I received news from certain sources that men of the Habr Tunis tribe intended to procure arms from Arabia. Their movements were closely followed both here and in Aden, and finally I was informed that arms had been obtained and were to be run on a certain date in either one or three dhows, and to be landed within 60 miles to the west of Berbera at a spot not known. The protectorate armed dhows were therefore sent out to patrol, but unfortunately did not intercept the smugglers, who successfully landed their cargoes during the night. The largest of the three dhows was subsequently arrested in Bulhar and sent to Berbera, where the master was charged with carrying false papers, and the other two shortly visited Berbera in the ordinary course. These latter vessels, as a result of most praiseworthy efforts by Mr. H. M. O’Byrne, the chief of customs, were found to have ammunition still [1824/—1]concealed on board, and the master of the former confessed under examination to having landed arms near Bulbar. p 3. Since the successful landing of these consignments has within a few days resulted in the death of some twenty or thirty natives in tribal fights among our friendlies I am more than ever convinced of the necessity of putting down the traffic with a strong hand, both for the good of the friendlies themselves and also to prevent their acouiring a strength which might enable them to defy the administration. Ihe^J three dhows will therefore be punished with the utmost rigour that the law allows, and I hope that the example will be sufficient to check the traffic for some considerable time to come. , „ ^ i 4. I believe, in fact, that the smuggling of arms to the west of Eerbera may now cease but to the east the problem is more difficult. Now that the north-east monsoon has set in, Warsangli and other dhows have resumed trading, and a large number of vessels are avoiding Aden and Berbera and aie sailing direct to Mokalla, where they have no difficulty in procuring fire-arms. The Warsangli have recently, to mv knowledge, obtained from this source and forwarded to the Mullah either five or ten boxes of Gras ammunition, and there is nothing to prevent their obtaining more, since we now have no administrative post east of Berbera, and it has been proved that the protectorate armed dhows are unable to exercise any effective control over native 5 In mv opinion it is much to be regretted that the calls upon the services of His Majesty’s navy elsewhere have resulted in the withdrawal of the cruiser formerly stationed at Aden for the purpose of patrolling the Arabian and Somali coasts. With the exception of a formal visit paid by the naval commander-in*chief in the autumn of last year, no war-ship has visited this coast durimr the past two yeais, unless when specially detailed for special service, such as the definite blockade of the Makhir coast or the maintenance of wireless communication. Natives are not slow to remaik upon this state of hffairs, and it is common talk among them that the continued absence of a cruiser renders gun-running a matter of small risk. 6. At the present moment, with the Mullah in a state ot undoubted ! weakness, it is, I think, specially necessary to prevent his obtaining further supplies of ariffg and ammunition, and I would strongly recommend that the Admiralty may be approached with a request that, as soon as practicable, a cruiser may again be stationed at Aden, wdience she could pay special attention to native cratt visiting the many small ports on the Arabian coast which are notorious centres of the arms trade.

(Confidential.) My Lord, Commissioner s Office, Berber a, July 13, 1910. WITH reference to your Lordship’s Confidential despatch of the 21st June, enclosing a copy of a communication which has been addressed to the Italian Ambassador on the subject of arms issued to or otherwise obtained by natives of this protectorate for the purposes of defence, I think it desirable to offer certain observations explanatory of the present situation in this matter. 2. In view of representations made to him by certain of the western tribes at Adadleh, Sir W. Manning informed them, as reported in his Confidential despatch of the 10th March last, that, although rifles illegally possessed would be liable to confiscation, they would be allowed to retain such arms, other than Government rifles, as they then had, or might afterwards acquire, provided that they brought them forward to be stamped and registered. This concession appears to have been misconstrued by the tribes into a general permission to obtain from any source as many rifles as they wished. On the 7th March last the Governor of Jibuti telegraphed an enquiry, of which a copy is enclosed, as to whether natives of this protectorate had obtained permission to purchase arms there. Since such sales at Jibuti to natives living within the prohibited zone would have been a distinct breach of the General Act of Brussels, Sir W. Manning replied asking that no sales should be permitted, and I am satisfied from subsequent correspondence that M. Pascal is still using every effort to prevent the illegal purchase ARMS TRAFFIC. CONFIDENTIAL. [August 22.] Section 1. 130589] No. 1 Sir, the information of Secretary Sir E.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to transmit to you, for I am, &amp;c. FRANCIS J. S. HOPWGOD. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Acting Commissioner Byatt to the Earl of Crewe. yessel. [2871 —1]2 4. Under the conditions at present existing, I am of opinion that onr tribes on the frontier are in a strong position, and I believe that the arms issued to them by Sir Manning are amply sufficient to ensure their safety so long as they maintain their present measure of cohesion. But the indiscriminate possession of aims bjr natives in the immediate vicinity of the coast—and these are the people who are nmv obtaining them—I regard with considerable distrust. As they are in little danger of attack from outside, their arms can, and will, be used only for the furtherance of internal quarrels, and will thus prove a source of weakness to them rather than of strength. This is not only my own opinion: it is shared by some of the older and, therefore, wiser and more peaceable of the natives themselves, who think, and rightly, that there was less risk to life in petty disputes such as the Somali loves when spear and club were the national weapons than there is now, when a word is followed by a bullet. . • r* nr • 5. A further point is this, that the rifles issued by Gm eminent, being ot Martini or ‘303 pattern, can always be eventually controlled by regulating the supply of ammunition, or bv stopping it entirely in case of need ; whereas smuggled rifles, being of the Gras pattern, can never be controlled, since supplies of ammunition will always be obtainable without either the consent or the assistance of the Government. 6. I therefore think that there is a danger in allowing natives to provide them selves with arms, and X propose to continue a stringent enforcement of the regulations against illicit import whenever an opportunity occurs. It is impossible to say what number of rifles have been smuggled into the protectorate during the past few months of revival in the trade, but I think that 200-300 would not be an over-estimate. I ■would point out the extreme difficulty of obtaining evidence against smugglers and their vessels, where it is to the supposed interest of natives generally to conceal all facts connected with the trade. This and the ease with which arms can be purchased either on the Arabian coast or through Arab agents at Jibuti itself render the task of detection a difficult one. Certain useful information has, however, latterly come to light, and in this connection I enclose, as a matter of interest, a copy of a statement recently made to me by a native formerly engaged as a professional gun-runner, and now a useful adherent of the Government, whose word I have no reason to doubt. 7. Finally, although I am convinced that the French do no^v refuse to sell arms to Somalis at Jibuti, I would repeat the observation, which has been made many times before, namely, that, while Jibuti remains as a source of supply, whether direct or indirect, or otherwise, while the Arabian littoral remains outside the prohibited zone ” no effort directed at the entire suppression of the arms traffic in this protectorate can be successful, and at the best but a limited check upon it can be exercised. _ But for the entrepot at Jibuti the Mullah could never have attained to the formidable power which has been his for the last ten years. I have, &amp;c. H. A. BYATT. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Governor, Jibuti, to Commissioner, Berbera. (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) Marc/i 7, 1910. ON the 7th March some natives tribe Samantur Abdulla say that they are authorised to purchase arms at Jibuti. I request your Excellency to telegraph me whether I may allow these purchases. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Commissioner, Berbera, to Governor, Jibuti. (Telegraphic.) [Undated.] I TXIANK you for your telegram of the 7th March. Since our natives live within the zone defined by article 8 of the General Act of Brussels, I request that you will prevent the purchases which they desire.Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Memorandum of Statement made to Acting Commissioner Byatt on June 17, 1910. ALL rifles come originally from Jibuti, and are brought by dhows to the following places on the Arabian coast:— . Eas Ara &gt; Shugra, Balhaf, Erka, Mokalla. There is no settlement at Ras Ara; riding camels await a dhow s arrival and take the arms to Lahej. Erom there, as required, arms are taken for sale into Aden; ammunition is carried in camel saddle- bags, and iifl.es are concealed in loads of kurbL or of firewood. Any Arab wishing to take rifles, &amp;c., to Aden first obtains a “ pass ” from the Sultan’s clerk, enabling him to enter Aden unhindered. In Aden rifles are hidden either on a small island ofl Maala used only by fishing-boats, or else in the town of Maala itself. There is no risk about the latter proceeding. I myself was formerly in the arms trade, and have kept rifles in a house at Maala for three months, wrapped in a blanket. All this is quite well known in Aden to every native, and the Somali police are, of course, aware of it. There are four principal brokers in Aden, one a Mijjertein named Haji Abdi Matan, Warbaneya, and three Warsangli. I do not know the names of tlie latter, but if you wish I can go to Aden and get you full details, since I am known there as an ex-gun-runner and am not suspected. The price of a rifle and fifty rounds in Aden is 30 rupees. Three or four years ago I went to Jibuti to buy rifles. They will not sell directly to Somalis, so one has to employ Arab or Lankali agents. I, disguised as an Arab, went with some of these men to a large store in the town where the Erenchmen live— I do not know the name of the store. They bought for me twenty rifles at 12|- dollars each with 100 rounds per rifle, and I paid them 1 rupee per rifle as commission. Things still go on in the same way there. Erom Jibuti I went on an Arab dhow, which took clearance for Aden, direct to Bosaso, where I landed the rifles for Sultan Osman Mahmud. Practically every dhow visiting this coast carries contraband. Rifles are hidden behind the matting on the vessel’s sides, between skins, under the fire-box, or in the furled sail. Ammunition generally in ghi-tins which are then re-soldered. These tins for greater safety are sometimes dropped into the barrel of drinking water. At the present time rifles go chiefly from Jibuti to Shugra, where any one can buy them. The Sultan charges 5 rupees export duty on every rifle. I do not know whether he takes import duty as well. The price at Shugra of a rifle with forty rounds is 30 rupees plus 5 rupees duty. There are plenty of rifles to be had anywhere along the Arabian coast. The first man who ever smuggled arms was a Mijjertein named Urbeta, who, fifteen years ago, before the Mullah started, bought 250 rifles in Jibuti, and took them to Osman Mahmud at Bosaso. He was later on arrested by the Italians at Massowah, and I do not know whether he is still alive. H. A. BYATT. Berbera, June 17, 1910. * * Stalks of the Holeus sorghina or millet.—H. A.

Commissioner's Office Berbera, 13th July 1010. n }f y Lord, With reference to your Lordship’s Confidential despatch of the 21st June, enclosing a copy of a com munication which has been addressed to the Italian Ambassador on the subject of arms issued to or other wise obtained by natives of this Protectorate for the purposes of defence, I think it desirable to offer certain observations explanatory of the present situa tion in this matter* 2.

On the 7th March last the Governor of Djibouti tei* graphed an enquiry, of vhich a copy is en closed, as to whether natives of this Protectorate had obtained permission to purchase arms there. Since such sales at Djibouti to natives living within the pro hibited zone would have been a distinct breach of the GeneralO-eneral Act of Brussels, Sir W, Manning replied asking that no sales should he permitted; and I am satisfied from subsequent correspondence that M. Pascal is still using every effort to prevent the illegal purchase of weapons by Somalis in French territory* 3* It is noteworthy that, in spite of Sir W, nning’s liberal offer in the matter f not a single rifle has, so far, been presented for registration; yet, whether as a result of his offer, or us a natural consequence of the evacuation of the interior, a strong stimulus has been given during the past few months to the illicit traffic in arms. From mny sources I have received information, afterwards corroborated, of the landing of cargoes of arms at several points on the Coast. A vary considerable quantity has been landed by two dhows at Bongarita, between Bulhar and Zeyla, for the use of our Western tribes; and on two recent occasions a third dhow has taken consignments of arms and ammunition to Galweida near Laskhorai, whence they would without doubt eventually reach the Mullah. I have not so far identified the Bongarita dhows, though enquiries are still being made; but in the Calweida affair, I have fortunately been able to convict and imprison the Arab owner, and have con fiscated the vessel, one specially built for speed in smuggling operations. This, together with the im prisonment of an individual native who landed in Berbera with ammunition concealed on his person and amon&lt; his effects, may, I hope, tend to check the traffic, which is far more widespread than I lad until lately supposed. I have today received information of the intended landing of a further consignment near Bulhar, and—and I am sending the armed dhows to patrol the Coast and watch for the suspected vessel, 4, Under^the conditions at present existing I am of opinion that our tribes on the frontier are in a strong position, and I believe that the arms issued to them by Sir W. Manning are amply sufficient to ensure their safety so long as they maintain their present measure of cohesion, ?ut the indiscriminate possession of arms by natives in the immediate vicinity of the Coast - and these are the people who are now obtaining them - I regard with considerable distrust, As they are in little danger of attack from, outside, their arms can, and will, he used only for the furtherance of internal quarrels, and will thus prove a source cf weakness to them, rather than of strength.

The three Governments engage to make joint representations to the Negus with a view to the prohibition, in accordance with the provisions of the General Act of Brussels, of the traffic in arms and ammunition in Abyssinian territory. 4. As regards the supervision of dhows trading for arms from Jibuti, Aden, Perim, Zeila, Massawah, Assab, and other ports of those regions to points outside the zone of protection defined by the Act of Brussels, measures will be taken to prevent them from smuggling. 5. While expressly maintaining the principles of French legis lation in regard to the right of visit, and it being agreed that the British and Italian Governments maintain their principles in regard to this question, the French Government agrees that the measures of control exercised by the local authorities in British and Italian territorial waters over small British and Italian native merchant craft (dhows) shall be also applicable in Italian and British territorial waters to dhows flying the French flag. The British and Italian Governments also agree that the measures of control exercised by the local authorities in French territorial waters over small French native merchant craft (dhows) shall also be applicable to dhows flying the British or Italian flags. These measures shall be inforced without necessitating a recourse to the formalities laid down by the Consular Conventions in force between the three Governments^ 6. In order to facilitate the supervision of native craft, and in order to prevent any wrongful use of the flag, the three Govern ments engage to communicate to each other every year a list of the dhows authorized to fly their respective flags. 7. The three Governments will further see that the dhow owners authorized to fly the French, British, or Italian flag shall show such plain marks on their craft as will permit of easy recognition at a distance. 8. The British, French, and Italian Governments agree to instruct their respective local authorities to concert amongst themselves as to the best means of carrying out the measures to be taken as the result of this Agreement. 9. The present Agreement shall hold good for a period of twelve years from the date of signature, and shall then remain in force for periods of three years, unless it is denounced six months before.

Sir:- 3£01 Foreign Office April 1910. With reference to your letter of the 22nd Febiu- ary last relative to the Anns Traffic in the Red Sea, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that he has been furnished by the Secretary of State for the Colonies with a copy of a Despatch from the Governor of the East African Protectorate dealing with this question. Sir Percy Girouard explains that the delay which has occurred in replying to the Despatch on this sub ject which was addressed to his predecessor on 1st March, 1909, instructing him to concert measures with the British Agent at Zanzibar for the issue of foirns to British East Africa and Zanzibar dhows only, was due to the fact that before he received any reply »m the Zanzibar Government on the subject, the ident at Aden informed him that the Secretary of t State ritee-eivuQ S9 APR 1910 ilMDIA QFFldfef ^ 0 , 1 , I Mil &gt;. Under Secretaiy of State, India Office.(15649/10) State for India desired haimony in the action to he taken with regard to dhows hy the authorities of Zanzibar, Aden and British East Africa. It accord ingly became necessary to consult the Government of Aden in the matter, and the delay v/hich has occurred in coming to a decision is, he points out, due to the length of time taken by the Resident of Aden to reply to his letter. Sir Percy Girouard goes on to state that he and the British Agent at Zanzibar are in complete accord as to the forms required, but that there are several forms in use at the port of Aden which neither he nor Mr. Clarke consider necessary. In view of this fact, and since neither Aden dhows call at East African ports nor vice versa, Sir P. Girouard thinks that it is hardly necessary to include Aden in the arrangement which it is desired to reach in the matter. In view of this opinion of Sir Percy Girouard, Sir E. Grey will be glad, before coming to any deci sion, to learn whether the Resident at Aden on his side(13649/10). side has furnished Viscount Morley with any observa- o tions on this subject.

London, Si r &gt; 10th January 1910. In • my note of 13th October .1909, I had the honour, under instructions from my Government, to propose to you that, with a view to the execution of Article 6 of the agreement of 13th December 1906 relative to the arms traffic, the three contracting Powers should reciprocally communicate to one another the forms of the acts of nationality of the dhows flying their respective flags, instead of the annual lists of the dhows themselves. The British Government agreed to this proposal, as you informed me in your note of 7th January 1909, and in a note addressed to Count de Bosdari dated 3rd April last they expressed their intention of modelling their forms as far as possible upon the type of those which are issued by the Italian authorities, and which had, in the meantime, been communicated to the British Government. The Italian Government then endeavoured to secure a similar adhesion on the part of the French Government ; and the latter, after some negotiation, also accepted the Italian proposal, but modified it in the sense that the reciprocal communication of the forms should not take the place of that of the annual lists, but should be made supple mentary to the latter formality, which would facilitate the task of fixing the nationality of dhows in the event of their names not figuring on the lists. The Italian Government, having agreed in their turn to this modifi cation, have instructed me to inform you of the fact, and to ask you to be good enough to let me know whether the British Government are also prepared to accept it, in order that steps may be taken to exchange the forms with the Government of the French Republic.

Sir In my note of October 13th 1908, I had the honour, under instructions from my Crovernraent to propose to you that, with a view to the execution of article 6 of the agreement of December 13th 1906 relative to the arms traffic, the three contracting powers should reciprocally communicate to one another the forms of the acts of nationality of the dhows flying their respective flags instead of the annual lists of the dhows themselves. The Britisn Government agreed to this proposal, as you informed me in your note of January 7th 1909, and in a note addressed to Count de Bos- dari dated April 3rd last, they expressed their intention of modelling their forms so far as possible upon the type of those which are issued by the Italian authorities and which had in the meantime been communicated to the British Government. The Italian Government then endeavoured to secure a similar adhesion on the part of the French Government; andcal comraunication of the forms should not take the place of that of the annual lists but should be made supplemen tary to the latter formality which would facilitate the task of fixing the nationality of dhows in the event oi their names not figuring on the lists. The Italian Government having agreed in their turn to this modification have instructed me to inform you of . the fact and to ask you to be good enough to let me know whether the British Government are also prepared to accept it # in order that steps may be taken to exchange the forms with the Government of the French Republic.

We have the honour to refer to Your Lordship’s Secret despatch No. 6, dated the 12th February 1909, regarding alleged flaws in the regulations at Aden for the control of the local dhow traffic, and to forward, for the con- * Letter from the Government of Bombay, sideration of His Majesty s Government, No. 5238, dated the soth July 1909 , and the attached correspondence* containing enclosures. foe views of the Resident at Aden and the Government of Bombay on the subject. 2. We concur generally in the conclusions arrived at by the local author ities that the cases cited by the Senior Naval Officer at Aden in his general letter, dated the 18th December 1908, to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, were not the result of irregularities permitted by the Harbour Police and Customs at Aden, or of flaws in the Regulations in question; and that consequently it is unnecessary to make any alterations in the revised draft of t Secret despatch No. si (External), dated the the Regulation which a waits’)' Your Lord- 23rd April 1908 . ship’s approval.

It does not appear that m either of these cases any irregularities were permitted by the Harbour Police and Customs at Aden. Such irregularties as occurred took place after the vessels had left Aden and were beyond the control of the Aden authorities. 3. In the case of the Italian dhow the Master was prosecuted at Berhera for a breach of the Somaliland Customs Regulations*—the facts of the case were also communicated to the Italian Consul-General at Aden, who ordered the forfeiture of the bond. 4. In the case of the English dhow the breach of Customs Regulations was, as a matter of fact, prevented. But the dhow was sent to Aden to be prose cuted for making a false declaration of its cargo and destination and a conviction was obtained. 5. In neither case, therefore, is it accurate to say there was a flaw in the Local Regulations, but at the same time I am to express the full concurrence of His Excellency the Governor in Council with the views expressed in para graphs 5 and 6 of the secret letter, dated 27th February 1909, from the Com missioner of Somaliland to the Colonial Office, which are reproduced below for ready reference:— “ 5. These two instances are no doubt typical of similar cases, which would otherwise pass undetected were it not for the special restrictive measures which are at present in force on the coast line east of Berbera. They do not, however, so much disclose flaws in the existing Regulations, which are, in my opinion, as stringent as it is possible to make them, as they illustrate defects in the machinery available for enforcing them. “ 6. These defects can only be remedied by placing responsible agents at the principal ports of call, both on the Arabian littoral and on the opposite African coast, and by regularly patroliing the intermediate coast line between those ports. Such measures, however, could only be regarded as expensive makeshifts, and would not go to the root of the evil. Until restrictions can be applied at the sources of the arms traffic, namely, at Jibouti in the case of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and at Maskat in the case of the Persian Gulf, arms and ammunition will continue to leak through in spite of local regulations ”. No. C.—92, dated the 17th April 1909 (Confidential). From— Major-General E. DeBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your endorsement No. 2009, dated the 18th March 1909, forwarding copies of correspondence relative to certain flaws which have been reported to exist in the Aden Regulations as to local dhow traffic, I have the honour to state that it is not clear to me on what grounds Captain Hunt considered the two instances quoted by him to be irregularities on the part of the Harbour Police and the Customs authorities at Aden,2 n i 2. Instance No. 1 in no way concerns Aden as the bond of an Italian dhow proceeding direct from Aden to Bunder Cassim is issued by the Italian Consul- General at A den. All that we have to do with such a dhow is to issue a Port Clearance to the Nakhoda on the production of the bond issued by the Italian authorities ; and that is the last we know of him, as we do not possess customs stations anywhere on the Arabian Coast. Neither does instance No. 2 concern Aden. It is, I submit, for the Italian Government and the Somaliland Administration to police their respective Coasts in order to prevent their revenues from being defrauded. If they complain to us that a dhow has broken its bond, we take up the case; we are at present doing this in one instance reported by the Commissioner, Somaliland. 3. Under these circumstances, I think that the views of the Italian and the Somaliland authorities would throw more light on the question. P. D. letter No. 3799, dated the 27th May 1909. From—The Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C.—92, dated the 17th April 1909, on the subject of certain flaws which are stated by the Senior Naval Oflicer at Aden to exist in the Aden Regulations as to the local dhow traffic. 2. I am to enquire whether the Senior Naval Officer at Aden brought to your notice the two instances mentioned by him in paragraph 15 of his letter, dated the 18th December 1908, to His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief, East Indies Station, and, if so, what action you took in the matter. If the Senior Naval Officer did not bring these cases to your notice, I am to enquire whether the fact that in the first case the dhow was Italian would have made it difficult for you to take action similar to that taken in the case reported to Government by Brigadier-General Mason in his letter No. 233, dated the 28th July 1904, either under the existing Regulation or under the proposed new Regulation. If such difficulties exist, I am to request that you will state them fully and submit any suggestions you may have to make for overcoming them. No. C.—155, dated Aden Residency, the 26th June 1909 (Confidential). From— Major J. 'W. B. Merewether, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your letter No. 3799, dated the 27th ultimo, I have the honour to state that neither of the two cases mentioned by the Senior Naval Officer were brought by him to my notice. The second case, however, was reported to me by the Commissioner in Somaliland and the Nakhoda has been tried by Major Hamid and convicted. 2. I do not think that we could take action against the Italian dhow under Regulation III of 1902 as w T e cannot assume jurisdiction over Italian territory and protected subjects. The case referred to in General Mason’s letter No. 233, dated the 28th July 1904, was entirely different as the Nakhoda in that case had disclaimed Italian protection, had been disavowed by the Italian Consul-General, and had not executed the usual bond in the Italian Consulate. 3. I do not think that any alterations are needed in the revised Regula tion which was submitted for the approval of the Secretary of State with the Government of India letter No. 81 of the 23rd April 1908. The root of the evil, as Government are aware, is pointed out in paragraph 6 of Captain Cordeaux s letter, dated the 27th February 1909, received with your endorse ment No. 40u7, dated the 7th instant. The best means of diminishing our difficulties is whole-hearted co-operation on the part of the Italian authorities and this appears to have been afforded in the particular case under considers tion {vide paragraph 3 of Captain Cordeaux’s letter already quoted), Foreign Office Press—No. 722—23-8-OU—28.1909.

February 27th, 1909 His Majesty's My Lord:- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's Secret despatch of the 5th Febru ary, transmitting for my observations a copy of a let ter from the Foreign Office, with enclosures, respect ing certain flaws in the Eegulations for the local dhow traffic. 2. The two specific cases instanced by Cap tain Hunt in the fifteenth paragraph of his letter both came under my personal observation, as I happened to be visiting Las Khorai in His Majesty's Ship 'Fox” at the time of their detection. 3. In the case of the Italian dhow, the na tive master was prosecuted, convicted, and fined at Berbera for a breach of the Somaliland Customs Regula tions. At the same time the facts of the case were communicated to the Italian Consul-General at Aden, whowho ordered the forfeiture of the bond deposited in Aden hy the owner of the dhow, in accordance with Section 3 of the ’’Aden Sea Traffic in Anns Regula tion, 1902,” 4. In the case of the English dhow, the cir cumstances left little douht that it was only the presence of a ship-of-war at Las Khorai that pre vented her from landing at that port more than the amount of cargo shewn in the Aden manifest, and so committing a breach of the Customs Regulations. The dhow was therefore sent to Aden, where the owner and master will he prosecuted for making a false de claration of his cargo and its destination. 5. These two instances are no douht typical of similar cases which would otherwise pass undetected were it not for the special restrictive measures which are at present in force on the coast-line East of Berbera. They do not, however, so much disclose flaws in the existing Regulations, which are, in my opinion, as stringent as it is possible to make them, as they illustrate defects in the machinery avail able for enforcing them.6. These defects can only he remedied hy placing responsible agents at the principal ports of call, both on the Arabian littoral and on the opposite Afri can coast, and by regularly patrolling the interme diate coast-line between those ports. Such measures, however, could only be regarded as expensive make shifts, and would not go to the root of the evil. Until restrictions can be applied at the sources of the arms-traffic, namely at Jibuti in the case of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and at Muscat in the case of the Persian Gulf, arms and ammunition will continue to leak tnrough in spite of local Regula tions.

The blockade has enabled us to discover several flaws in the regulations for the local dhow traffic, and it has also brought to light certain irregularities permitted by the harbour police and Customs at Aden. “15. For instance, an Italian dhow declares her cargo for Bander Cassini in Italian Somali Land, she gives a bond that she will not call at any other port first, she goes to Makallah or other Arabian Port, ships arms and goes to Las Khorai, discharges all her cargo, proceeds to Bander Cassim and brings back to Aden a few sheep and hides from Bander Cassim, there is no Italian official at Bander Cassini and no one is the wiser. In another case an English dhow declares 100 bags of rice for Las Ivhorai, remainder of cargo for Bander Cassim, she gives a bond that her first port of call is Hais where we have a Customs station, she goes there, pays duty on 100 bags and goes to Las Khorai and lands remainder of her cargo there, thus defrauding our Customs.”[ In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 2540/09. and address — The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. y Sir:- Foreign Office January 1909* I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s Confidential despatch of the 3rd November transmitting for my observations copy of Foreign Office letter with inclosure, on the subject of the arms traffic in the Gulf of Aden. 2. I concur in the observations of the Italian Ambassador that the annual list of dhows to be exchanged between the three contracting Governments will, for the reasons noted, require constant revision, and, owing to the delay that must necessarily occur in notifying the various corrections, can hardly ever be up to date. 3. The arrangement suggested in the Italian note would appear to offer the best means of securing the prompt and effective identification of dhows at sea, and I would recommend that we should accede to the Italian proposal. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. E. S. CORDEAUX.

The blockade is having e most excellent effect on the Somali tribes* the ^araangli especially have never really recognised the Sirker as a power in the land and only occasionally see a representative from the Government when e «kHi of war visits the const; mm they find that we are &gt; &gt;'blc to double the price of ;train end dates and of course \ recognise that at any moment all trade can he stopped and all dhows seized. 11. ^he Mullah has apparently gone off and left then at our mercy after making use of them anti t think it will b€ j a long time before they again run after false gods. .12. Aa regards the arms traffic* nothing has been landed on our coast except in one case which occurred on the night, of fsrd Dec. when a two ton dhow from Makalleh got in about two miles from one of f ha armed dhows and it is reported that about twenty rifles were landed* this is probably correct as a head nan of t he *'*u llah/s was in the dhow. IS.18. Tt is unlikely that ^ny dhows win be cru.;ht the nfm tra^fio on our coast. 14. he lilocHade has enabled us to discover several has also brought to light certain irregularities permitted by the harbour police and customs nt Aden. 15. For instance, an Italian dhow declares her cargo for Bender Casein in Italian domaliland, she gives a bond that she win not call at any other port first, she goes to Makalleh or o+ her Arabian Port, ships rrns and goes to Lm Khoral, discharges all her cargo, proceeds to Pander Cass in nnd brings hack to Aden a f ev.- sheep and hides fron Bander Caasin.there is no Italian official at Pander CrbsAr and no one is the wiser. In another case an Rnglish dhov' declares 100 bags of rice for has Khorai, remainder of Cf-rgo for Banner Cassia, she gives n Umd thet Imp first ( port of coll is Isis where we have a Customs station, she goes there, pays duty on 100 bags end goes to has Khorri and lands remainder of her wrgo there, thus defrauding our customs. / 10. As regards the Ounlayers Test , 'For' and 'Proser pine' have never, met for nrre t.han a few hours at a tine since '’-’or' arrived in September. 1'. Certain peculiarities have been discovered with, regard +t&gt; wireless cornaunicfd ion on the Somali Coast (a) Atmospherics interfere for from 0 to f) hours a day ''Sept, to December). A. (a) No mes^e can be sent along the Coast aoul.h of bearing D. 70OE (true) from Berber?, but if the ship proceeds twenty miles North from Berber?, then has 'Choral rinws in the regulations for the local dhow traffic and it isis in comnunicstion ^00 miles ewey f there is gone obstruction which net,a like a screen just Inside R&amp;s Khan?;ir f ss Anker v only 70 miles from Berbers* is cut off.

IB* The Treasury have a proved of £2000 being aonroariated for establishing a wireless station at Berbers* id. A powerful station is approved of for Aden but it will not be provided for three of four years. 20.
