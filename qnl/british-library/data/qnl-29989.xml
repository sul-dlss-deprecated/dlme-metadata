Fry had a conversation with Major-General ChaudhMiri and his wife in Bombay, and was able to ask them about 'a vague rumour he had heard about a matrimonial alliance in prospect between the Asafjhai and PaAlevi Houses*’. Both declared that there was nothing in the rumour. Chaudhouri seemed genuinely surprised at it, and his wife thought that the Nizam had no daughter who would be a suitable match as regards age and so forth. They were also positive that Princess Ashraf had not made a journey to Hyderabad, and it seems unlikely that she could have done so v/ithout its being known. 3. This is not to say, of course, that there were no negotiations in Bombay without Chaudhouri* s knowledge. If there were any. Fry has heard nothing of them and he has not been able to sound his Persian colleague, who is apparently hardly ever,to be met with and is something of a man of mystery. Fry has promised to do so if he has an opportunity and will let us know if anything of interest emerges. 4-. Copies of this letter go to Chanceries at Teheran and Karachi, and a spare copy is enclosed for the Foreign Office.

The Pakistan Government have released ( no information about these talks, apart from the usual communique to the effect that they were held in a cordial atmosphere. I understand from an official of the Pakistan Ministry of Civil Aviation that it proved impossible to cover all the ground during Mr..

The copy of the Tehran letter, as it reached us, y had three reference numbers on it, vis., ,rol.Ext.l7£&amp;4-/AB , h,o. 0-259/7/48 and ' ' ' 14940, and was dated 10th November. 2. In the course of his stay in Delhi, v/here he came to attend both the Inter national Meteorological Conference and the International Civil Aviation Regional Conference, which follov/ed each other in close succession in November and early December, Mr. Chafik, the Director General of Civil Aviation in Iran, contrived to negotiate a temporary air transport agreement with the Government of India, whereby it was agreed that an Iranian airline designated by the Government of Iran, and an Indian airline designated by the Government of India, should oper ate on the Tehran/Bombay route via Zahidan and Karachi. The Government of India were represented during the negotiations by Mr. 7.A.R.Menon, oecretary of the Ministry of Communications. Iranian Airways started this service on December 10th. 3. Y/e gather that on the way back to Tehran Hr. Chafik was due to enter negotia tions with the Government of Pakistan for a permanent bilateral air agreement with Pakistan. A separate report on these negotiations will no doubt be sent home to you by Karachi. 4. On their arrival in Delhi Mr. Chafik and his wife. Princess Ashraf, and Princess Ashraf 1 s sister. Princess Fatima, were guests of the Governor General in Government House. In the course of their stay* they made some rather astonish ing remarks, Princess Ashraf setting the pace at dinner on tne first night when she began the conversation by asking H.E. whether he ate monkeys, and when he demurred, asking him whether he worshipped them. 5. I personally had a most illuminating conversation with Princess Fatima, which ran on the following lines:- ’’Does Australia belong to you?” - ’No'. 'But they fought for you during the war, didn’t they' - 'Yes, but so did about 30 other nations' - 'India fought for you, didn't it' - 'Yes, jolly well, in/Africa and Italy particularly' - 'It must be wonderful having colonies to do your fighting for you' - 'They aren't colonies' - 'But they fought for you, didn't they?' 'So did the U.3.A.' 'or that mAtter'. - 'Yes, th^t' s true\j^j*t,. *Did Canada fight for you?' 'Yes. Don’t you remember Dieppe and Northern Europe?' 'Yes, it really is wonderful having all those colonies to do your fighting for you. You didn't have to do any, did you.' - L.B.w’alsh— .trins Commonwealth Relations Office, A.I made one or two remarks suggesting that we did, in fact, play some part in the war, a point which she graciously conceded, reiterating, however, that the part we had played had 'been very small compared with that played by the 'Colonies”. She did not blame us. She thought it all very wise and very clever, 6, The party left Delhi on December 11th, and were due to spend 4 or 5 days in Bombay before proceeding to Karachi, As we loiow well enough, contacts with the agents at Hyderabad have in the past all too frequently taken place at Bombay. It is likely that if any contacts on the lines visualised in Tehran's letter to Michael T ,’/right were con-emplated that they would have taken place during the stay in Bombay. But we have no evidence which would tend to confirm the suggestion contained in the Tehran letter. We will, of course*, report to you if any relevant information about the contacts of these people while they were in Bombay comes our way.

As you may have seen, the ostensible purpose of this journey was that the Princess’s husband, Mr. Ghafil:, who is Director of Civil Aviation here, is arranging, for an air service between Persia, Pakistan and India, and that the Princess thought it would be rather fun to accompany her husband, it seems that the Indian Ambassador was never informed of the Princess’s intention and was much annoyed to read the first news of it in the papers. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of Chafik’s mission, but you may be interested to know that a story, so far unconfirmed, is current here which suggests that the Princess’s decision to accompany him was neither as sudden or as capricious as it has been made to appear. / According M.R.

It seems that the Nizam is feeling none too secure and would like to find a accure retreat both for himself, his family and his vast fortune, and that it is not the Shah’s intention to discourage him from bringing them all to Persia.

(K ^273/1547/234) t ^ i&amp;Mvi ^ fv In the diplomatic and consular expenditure in Iran for 1938-9, which requires adjustment between Indian revenues and the Foreign Office, there appears an item of £250 in respect of wedding presents given by Their M a -jesties to the Crown Prince and Princess of Iran. We do not know whether presents were also given on this occasion by the Government of India, but, if you agree, we are inclined to exclude this item from the adjustment, and it has, in fact, been excluded from the 1938-9 statement of Imperial Government expenditure in Iran which has recently been prepared. In 1939-40 expenditure amounting to about £850 was incurred by the mission which attended the Royal Marriage, subject to your views, we will exclude this item also.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3646/3141/34] June 20 , 1938. Section 3. Copy No. r L Mr. Nevile Butler to Viscount Halifax.—{Received June 20) (No. 210.) My Lord, Tehran, June 3, 1938. WITH reference to my telegram No. 60 of the 27th May, I have the honour to report that the Iranian Government have spared no pains to emphasise the importance of the engagement of the Valiahd to Her Royal Highness Princess Fowzieh of Egypt. The press has reported at length the demonstrations of enthusiasm with which the engagement has been greeted in Tehran and the provinces. The capital has been beflagged and illuminated, and every cab, taxi and motor-bus has been bedecked with flags, first Iranian only, and then Egyptian also, with white crescent and stars hastily stitched on to the green ground. When every allowance is made for the power of official compulsion behind these demonstrations, there is reason to think that the Iranian people are genuinely pleased and flattered by this alliance with the ruling family of a leading oriental State. 2. It can fairly be said that the engagement is an event of importance. 1 have had no recourse to books of reference, but I cannot call to mind, at any rate in at all recent times, any instance of a dynastic marriage between the ruling houses of independent sovereign States professing Islam. Mahometan queens, whatever their influence within the palace, have hitherto been of little public account. The general custom of Persian kings has been to draw upon their own countrywomen, not necessarily of illustrious birth, to fill their harems and raise their issue. The Valiahd s engagement is, therefore, also an event of some histoiical interest. It shows Royalty, both in Iran and Egypt, emer^in 0, into a stage reached long ago in Christendom, but only now in Islam. 3. This development may have a more practical significance. Islamic history has shown the disintegrating effect of polygamy. Its effects have left their marks upon the whole fabric of society in Islamic countries, but in no way more conspicuously than in the internecine struggles for succession between sons of the same father, but different mothers, that have been the cause of so many palace revolutions, and the rock on which so many a dynasty has foundered. It seems possible that to the same set of causes should be attributed another phenomenon of oriental kingdoms, equally disastrous to the practice of govern ment and the stability of the dynasty, namely, the ruler’s habit of regarding his natural heir as his natural enemy, and so immuring him in the harem &amp; and giving him no chance of learning the art of ruling, or of forming political contacts in his father s lifetime. r n ^ P°^ nt view, the Shah has probably taken a wise step in t olio wing the European example of looking to another Royal familv for his heir s bride He has escaped from the atmosphere of the oriental harem. It is true that the Iranian Constitution as it reads to-day provides that the heir to a of .f ranian parentage on both sides. There can be little doubt that the Shah will arrange the necessary modification so that, provided his son s succession is secured and unless something cataclysmic happens in the meanwhile when his son dies there will be no question as' to who is the queen- mother and who is the heir. On this assumption, anyone who tries to upset the accession of the present Valiahd's heir, whether another member of the Koyal ramily by another wife, or a usurper from outside, will have to take into account an international complication. Thus the proposed marriage should strengthen the dynasty in more ways than one. T 3 ii^'- ^ n S a o err J® nt ^y also be regarded as bringing recognition that the Pahlavi family has arrived.” It was suggested in the annual report from this Post for 1937 that Reza Shah pays much attention to the age-old Persian Vle A °Li e aristocratic, hereditary and divine-right nature of monarchy. This is doubtless one of the reasons why he is so sensitive to anv mention of his [339 u—3]2 humble origin in the foreign press. By alliance with the family of Muhammad Ali Pasha, in comparison with which he is an upstart, Reza Shah has definitely climbed another rung on the dynastic ladder, and a grandson would be atavis edite regibus. There is no doubt that public opinion here, so far as it exists, feels that the marriage will improve the international standing of Iran. 6 . Another point of minor interest arising out of the engagement is t &gt; “~ bridging, or perhaps ignoring, of the Sunni-Shiah cleavage, which has been ai additional obstacle in the way of a monarch of Iran taking a bride from a neighbouring country. The marriage cannot be expected to be popular among the Iranian ulema. But it seems unlikely that the views of the ulema can count for much now, particularly when, as in the present case, the younger generation, already pretty indifferent to these religious distinctions, will be influenced by the offsetting glamour of a marriage with the Royal family of a country regarded as in the forefront of eastern States. 7. In yet another respect the marriage may help to further one of the main items of the Shah’s policy, namely, the emancipation of women. The presence here of a Royal princess, with an education believed to be partly at least European, should undoubtedly help to extend the liberties that are being secured for them; more particularly if the princess is a daughter of Queen Nazli. 8 . Finally, it seems possible that in seeking this union the Shah may have in mind an extension of the policy of the Saadabad Pact. It will be remembered that, in his despatch No. 189 of the 24th February, Sir Miles Lampson reported a statement in the Egyptian press that Egypt would be asked to join this pact. Similar reports were current in Tehran. The press has laid much stress on the importance of the engagement as a union between oriental peoples, and though nothing has been said here to suggest that it may lead to an extension of the Saadabad Pact to Egypt, this might be one of its consequences. 9. At the moment the Iranian Prime Minister is about to leave for Cairo heading a delegation to make arrangements in connexion with the wedding. I have the honour to enclose herewith an extract from the Journal de Teheran of the 3rd June^ 1 ) recording an interview which M. Djam has given to a journalist on this subject. It is also announced that Mohammed-el-Mufti-el-Gazaerly Bey, now Egyptian Minister at Angora, is to revert to his previous post of Minister at Tehran in succession to Azzam Bey. 10 . In conclusion, it is perhaps of some interest that stories have reached me from Kerman, as well as in Tehran, that this betrothal has been engineered by the British. 11 . lam sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Cairo.

L j vJ- Sir, I have the honour to report that in the course of the last few days the Shah has Betrothed Both his daughters, the elder to the son of the Prime Minister, Mr Jam and the younger to the older son of Qawaa-ul-Mulk (Persian Personalities No.60)« Mr Jan junior who is about 21, was educated in Prance, where he has passed the greater part of the last six years. He has now entered the Military School at Tehran. Qawan-ul-Mulk*s son was educated at Bristol University and I hear from a reliable English source here that he is not Burdened with Brains nor with any great sense of responsibility. He is said to Be on intimate and excellent terms with his prospective Brother-in-law the Valiahd. It is not yet known when the marriages will take place, possibly not for some time. It is interesting that the Shah should Be allying his family with that of a popular if rather ineffective member of the eivll government (and incidentally very friendly to this country), and secondly to one of the Best known families in Shiras. Qawam-ul-Mulk was compelled to exchange his properties there for others near Nishapur in Khorasan and now resides very quietly in Tehran But lately when in Shiraz I was assured that the Qawam's family continues to enjoy considerable prestige in the province of Pars.

Qawam, Mirza Ibrahim Khan (Qawam-ul-Mulk) - Born 1888. The son of Mirza Habibullah Khan Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was killed accidentally in May 1916, the title descending to Mirza Ibrahim Khan. During the war was very friendly to us, and carried on his father’s traditional policy of opposition to the powerful Qashqai group of tribes headed by the late Ismail Khan Soulat-ud-Douleh. Having inherited vast properties in Pars from his father, as well as the titular headship of the ’'Arab” tribes of that province, he wielded immense authority in the south of Persia at the time of the coup d’Etat of 1921. Reza Khan (now Reza Shah) when Minister of ^ar met Ibrahim Khan at Isfahan in August 19^3 and expressed a wish that the Qawam should reside at lehian; he thereiore became elected to the Majlis as member for the Khamseh (Arab) tribes and thereafter has resided a good deal in Tehran. Always on terms of close friendship with His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, the Qawam engaged in 1926 a British agricultural expert to develop his vast estates; the experiment proved a failure through local opposition and the Qawam’s stinginess; the British expert left in 1928. In 1929 fled to Europe, doubtless having foreseen the Qashqai revolts of that year. Visited London 1929. Returned to Tehran the following year, having put his two boys to school at Beirut. His vast properties were left in the hands of his servants, who remitted him a monthly subvention. In 1929 various questions of validity of title to property were raised by the Ministry of Finance; and in 1931 the whole question/question was the exchange of lands* The Qawam was given crown lands in Nishapur in the neighbourhood of Tehran, and elsewhere in the centre of Persia, in exchange for his Pars properties. It is believed that he did well out of these transactions, and that he is one of the wealthiest landowners of Persia at present. In the ninth Majlis of 1933 he was a Deputy for Baluchistan* He had also accornpanied Reza Shah on several ot his journeys, and was generally supposed to enjoy His Maj68ty f s full confidence. In November 1933, however, on the arrest of the Minister of War, Sardar Asad, while in attendance on the Shah at the Turcoman races, the Qawam seems to have become the object of suspicion and he was placed under arrest with Asad. He is an attractive personality to meet. Very pro-British in sentiment, he has sent his two sons (Ali Muhammad Khan Qawam and Muhammad Reza Khan Qawam) to England to be educated at Oxford. Until his arrest he appeared to have settled down permanently as a peaceful courtier at Tehran. He plays polo, but does not mix much in society. Quiet in voice and retiring in manner, he is yet capable of driving a very hard bargain with his own countrymen. He does not appear to have much ambition. Though his name is still a household word at Shiraz, he cannot be considered a tribal leader in the sense that the Qashqai chiefs are; he is best considered as a Persian noble whose lamily had for some time held suzerainty over a group of tribes and who attained great wealth and influence in Pars, partly through backing the right side in the war.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

IN my despatch No. 246 of th^ 16th May, I had the honour to report on the return of the Valiahd to this country. In the course of a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, I questioned his Excellency about plans for his (the Valiahd's) future. M. Samiy informed me that it had i&gt;een definitely decided that His Imperial Highness should remain in this country and commence studies at the military academy. M. Samiy felt that, young though the Valiahd was, it was important that he should now get to know his country as well as contacts with the army. 2. I asked M. Samiy whether, now that the Valiahd had received the diplomatic missions, it was intended that he should have social relations with them. His Excellency seemed to find the question a little embarrassing, and said that no decision on this point had yet been taken. I understand, however, that, at any rate, the daughters of the Turkish Ambassador, who visit the Valiahd’s sisters regularly, have also met His Imperial Highness. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c.

[E 3168/405/34] Copy No. Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—{Received tlune 3.) (No. 246.) Sir Tehran, May 16, 1936. 3 311 WITH reference to my telegram No. 138 of the 12th May, I have the honour to report that the Valiahd left Switzerland tor Tran on the 29th April travelling by way of Austria and Hungary, Roumania and Russia. His Imperial Highness seems to have been given every attention by the Soviet authorities; taking a boat specially put at his disposal at Baku, he reached Pahlavi on the 7th May. He proceeded to the Mian-Pochte Palace, where he was received by the Shah with the Queen and his sisters. 2. The Imperial party spent three days seeing Gilan and Mazanderan, the two most fertile provinces of Persia, the best parts of which have been acquired and developed by the Shah. On the morning of the 10 th they arrived with a retinue of cars at 10 o’clock at Chalus and inspected a large silk factory under erection by Skoda. The party, consisting of the Shah walking ahead with the Valiahd and a younger brother, and the Queen and two princesses behind them, strolled over the large girder bridge crossing the Chalus River, past the modern hotel built originally for the Shah’s use, and up through the tea garden that surrounds the Shah’s lodge about a quarter of a mile beyond the hotel. The Shah’s imminent arrival had produced feverish activity in the hotel and Chalus generally, but he proved to be in smiling mood. Dwarfing his well-grown son, he pointed to some of the works of clearance and development that have been accomplished. His Imperial Majesty has, indeed, here and elsewhere in the two provinces, much to show. Nevertheless, what had happened a few days previously at Ramsar, the new health resort on the Caspian, is worth recording at this point as being perhaps symbolic. Prior to the Shah’s visit, hotel managers were decorating and redecorating their rooms; their gardeners were planting trees and even running with their large watering cans in hardly Iranian fashion. The Shah arrived; all except the earth quaked, and it had torn from it by the Imperial order the trees so lately planted. Then the Shah passed back to Shahsavar. A sigh of relief and exhaustion followed, activity collapsed and Persia returned to its kalian. 3. The afternoon of the 10 th May was devoted to a visit to the new port of Deh No under construction by the Netherlands Harbour Works Company some 6 kilom. from Chalus, and on the following day the party crossed the Elburz by the new Chalus road, en route for Tehran. At Kerej there was a reception, attended by Ministers, Under-Secretaries, the President of the Chamber and military officers of high rank. Speeches and presentations were made, and the students of the agricultural college marched past. The Imperial party reached a beflagged capital at 5 o’clock, and boy scouts and girl guides presented bouquets outside the palace. The next day was opportunely a Moslem holiday. 4. Subsequently, the protocol informed us that the Valiahd would receive the Diplomatic Body at the Gulistan Palace on the 16th May, and there took place this morning what was virtually a repetition of the No Ruz Salaam with the Valiahd replacing his father. On behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the members of the Legation and British residents in Tehran, I associated myself with the demonstrations of satisfaction and welcome with which His Imperial Highness had been greeted on his return to Iran, and was permitted to present the diplomatic staff of the Legation to him. The Valiahd, with good aquiline features, and attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, discharged his part with grace and courtesy. 5. The Valiahd has been away for five years at M. Carnal’s school in ^ Switzerland. He is nearly 17 years old and could succeed to the throne when he [740 c—3]r*\ is 18. It has, of course, long been conjectured that the Shah, to give stability to the dynasty, would before long introduce him to the woik o go\ernmen . M. Soheily has told me that it is probable that he will not return to hurope and will pursue military studies here, but that no decision has yet been taken. is too early to estimate popular feeling towards him, though his good looks and athletic interests have probably made a favourable impression. What does seem certain is that the Shah is genuinely devoted to him and is well content to have him back in this country. . ^ . c, , , .1 6 .

Addressed to Foreign Office No.IBS, repeated to Government of India No. 67.copy (K 67o8/608/44) 1935 | ^British Leg©tion # November llth f 19b6 Dear Baggpllay, Victor Mellet asked me a while ago whether X could find out anything about how the Grown Prince of Persia 9 who is at school near Geneva, is shaping. The Armstrongs (Vice Consul at Geneva) were the only people I knew of who were acquainted in any way with the school and I have just had a letter from Mrs. Armstrong on the subject. I enclose an extract from this letter, which I have also sent to Victor, in case you may cere to have the information it contains in the department. Yours &amp;c., (Signed) Terence Shone1,11 I lunched yesterday with M. Carnal, heedaester of i.e Hoeey school, and saw the Crown Prince of Persia ('saw' because X was not introduced and did not like to press the Matter on iho firet occasion}. The latter Is tall and well built (lacking the usual mlniature-iike Persian finesse) and Is an excellent all round athlete, being especially prominent in the football field. He is In fact one of Le Hosey's crack players. I am told all six brothers are extremely Intelligent, and the Crown Prince exceptionally 80 , besides being a hard worker. At the close of the last school year, he won the -rlx d'Excellence for work end he hopes to be allowed to spend one more year at the school In order to get his Baccelaureat In Lausanne. Besides the usual curriculum, the boys have daily Persian lessons with a tutor, specially appointed for this purpose by their father. Thie men, who lives in Rolle, treats the Crown Prince with the greatest deference and is said to be genuinely horrified whenever one of the other pupils slaps H.I.H. on the back.' The only other person who treats the young man in a similar manner is the Agi Khan, who frequently comes to Le Rosey to pay homage, and invariably bocks out of the room, etc. At the school, the Crown Prince is treated Just like the other boys, who even 'tutoyer' him; the only difference lying in certain privileges such as not filing in and out oi menls with the other boys, a room to himself, etc. I enquire.: or one of the masters whether the Persian boys did not show sn entirely different mentality, whether they were spoiled in any way or fitted with some difficulty into thesenew surroundings. I was told that the opposite was the case. They are simple and easy to get on with and only one of the younger ones (they are apparently by three different mothers) khowc a strong Oriental touchy in so far as he approaches problems and persons in a devious, rather than a direct way. The Crown Prince appears to be popular with the other boys, who in no way resent hie small privileges, as they are themselves in many cases the sons of princes or diplomats. (Lignes, Redziwills, Thurn and Taxis, Metterniche, etc.) .The school itself is delightful end Madame Carnal, who is an American, has managed to create that much abused thing: a 'Home Atmosphere”, with great success. Coffee in the drawing-room was like the seme ceremony in any cosmopolitan salon, the older boys &lt;±uite naturally taking pert in the conversation with the utmost ease and lack of self-consciousness. The whole effect was distinctly Aristocratic”, and is, I imagine, pretty expensive. Of the 65 boys about ten arc Knglish the others of every nationality under the sun, from about nine to eighteen years ox age. They have an Knglish sports master and their physicrl development, which is carefully studied and reported on to their respective families, is attended to by a trained nurse. On the whole, they appear to be in excellent hands, and e happier crowd would be difficult to imagine. Le Rosey school goes into residence in Ostaad for four months at the end of November.$ *- 4ND In any further oomi No and address —not ED “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. subject, pleaie quote uh'uc fa Sy name, but to— At / r a THE Under-Seoretary of State for ^ Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to lis Iaa^JUa. • Juuifijjth* and, by direct transmits herewith cop/# of the under-mentioned paper. tor,foreign Affairs presents nis yc^ jjliy irecfton or the Secretary of State, 7/&lt;r Foreign Office, , 193 I .

IN continuation of my despatch No. 4^7 of the 20th August, I have the honour to report that the Crown Prince of Persia left Tehran for Switzerland on the 5th September. His Imperial Highness was accompanied by the Shah as far as Pahlavi, where His Majesty saw him off. Teymourtache and Diba left on the 6th September at dawn to rejoin the main party at Pahlavi. where all boarded a special steamer for Baku on the afternoon of the 7th instant. 2. The party consists of those mentioned in my despatch No. 467, with the exception of the Shah's daughter, who, it was decided, should remain for the present in Tehran. The Crown Prince was accompanied by his Persian professor so that during his long stay in Europe he shall not forget his mother-tongue.’ W ith the party are also Colonel Reza Quli Khan, the director of the Pahlavi Bank and his wife. The colonel is to study banking in Lausanne for three years. 3. After having bid farewell to the Crown Prince, the Shah, attended by a small suite, will travel by the Caspian coast road to Astara and Tabriz, thence through Persian Kurdistan to Kermanshah and return to Tehran. His Maiesty will be away for some twenty days. 4. The Persian Ambassador in Moscow will meet the Crown Prince in Baku and escort him through Russian territory. 5. Teymourtache, after having placed the Crown Prince in school at Lausanne, will visit Berlin, where his Armenian wife has to undergo a further operation. He will then visit Vichy for a cure, go to Italy to be present at the I launching of one of the Persian gunboats, and then hopes to pay a visit to both j Paris and London.
