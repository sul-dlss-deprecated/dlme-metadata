Palaria was endemic ana was the cause of much oi the £,enpral ill-health of the population. The most prevalent diseases were dysentry, venereal and eye diseases and slou^hin^ ulcers. 9. K• a• I 1 ' . (i) On the 6th of karch at about 2100 hours an R.A.F. local Askaii ^uaroir^ the cable line ouusiue the Camp opened fire on a «jeep carrying h.A.F. Lilitaiy Police ana levies who were on patrol outy.

The A&amp;ktri was detained for interrogation anu eventually dismissed ano one of the injured E.O.Rs. was removed to Kabb&amp;niyah for treatment. (ii) On the l&amp;th a Wellii%ton aircraft flew over b.b* 'Afghanistan' which was anchored oil the island of Abu kusa. The aii era ft dropped a message on board and in doin^ so misjUdeea the height and carried away she top of one of the masts.

Tractors, electric plants end other machinery were sole to two Bahraini merchants who came down to Sharjah for this purpose. (iv) In fc^all the Assyrian Bevies were removea to Iraq having been replaced by 6 Companies of Iraqi Arab Levies, i.e. ISO men uncer one British Commanding Officer ana 6 Arab h.C.Os. In early November half of the rraqi Levy force was transferred to Bahrain preparatory to the withdrawal of the wi.ole Levy force from Sharjah. (v) During this year ti e strength ol the R.A.F. was reducea to nearly half of what it was last year. 10 . tireless masts and equipment belonging to the b.S.A.T.C. wireless Station at Sharjah were sola by the U.S.A* Army to the American Arabian Oil Co. at Dh&amp;hran, Sauai Arabia ana were shipped on a barge which left Bubei for Sauci Arabia on the 27th of July. 11. Local Affairs : % (1) In January, an agreement was reached between the Regent of Kalla ana the kuscat authorities in respect of a neutral zone between Diba/hisn (unaer Kalba) and Diba/Bai f ah (unaer kuscat) and the di*opping of all claims by both sides for loss of life arid property. The agreement made was for a period ol two yeai*s. In August, however, 4 Shihuh tiiieves who come uiidei* the tali of bai'ah (kuscat) attempted a theft on one of the date-gaiaens at hisn. The owner of the garden openec fired killing one oi the thieves and the rest escaped. Before trouble coulo break out the Shaikh of Fujairah mediated and effected a two-year truce. vA(ii) In Febrtiary an agreement was drawn up between the eni/-Beni Qivab cbiefc and tiie shaikh oi Sharjah, wheieby the la uter has undertaken tu pay the .Deri ^itab chiefs one ttird of the present arm future income from oil. ^(iii) The Shaikh of nas al Khaimah in agreement v,ith the kuscat State, built a tower ana Litintaiiita a ^airison in wsai al C,aur for the purpose oi preventing highway i*obbei*s from invsain£ the batinah Coast through V»adi al ^aur. The muscat Covernnient paiu the cost of builain^ the tov.er ana unaertook to pay for* the maintenance of the gan-ison (consisting of t men) 0 (iv) After the Khcr Shanechah episoue, relations between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi became strained ana in January the Shaikh of.Dubai organised the lootir^ of some ISO Abu Dhabi camels ana refused to return them despite the eavice # ^ given him by the Political Agent ana later by the Hon'ble the Political Resident. Due to the uncompromising attitude which the Shaikh of Dubai had aao^teu ana his failure to settle the dispute with aLu Dlmbi in normal tribal manner, sanctions were imposed on him by stopping travel documents arid other travel facilities to his subjects ana diverting one steamer to Sharjah. After giving up all hopes for settlement of the dispute, the Shaikh oi Abu Dhabi raised a force of some 2000 men under the command of his brother Shaikh H&amp;sza 1 bin Sultan which advanced towards Dubai. Instructions were issued by the Political Agent who was then at Sher^ah to the Abu Dhabi forces to stop where they were penning further instructions and in the meantime a sum of 2 lakhs of rupees was extracted from the Sheikh of Dubai for payment as compensation to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi ano a promise obtained from the Ruler of Dubai to ■f . i return Abu Dhabi camels. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi %reed to take over the money and the camels bu^ desired, in addition, that there should exist true friendly relations between him ana the Shaikh of Dubai. For tais purpose he authorised his brother Razza* tc carry out negotiations with Dubai on his behalf and put up certain new issues which were considered unreasonable. The/-9c ■w ■r-' - .&gt; o Tlie Refciuenc^ i^ent, ana the sheikh ol uni-el^ei^&amp;in hela meetin^fc v.itli the Shaikh ol hub^i, obteineo his consent to ^he pi'Oposea settlement siiC then proceeaec to the aeser*t, met Sheikh hesze 1 ana pei‘susdeb him to arop the nev. issues re.iseG by his brother, the sheikh of Atu Dhabi. The Resiaenc^ Ae,ent \ • end the Shaikh of um el Qaiv.ain then re turned to bubei, arevv up the final settlement agreement but the shaikh of Dubai turnea back on his previous promise ana put an objectionable aemand regardinb expropriation. All efforts maue by the Hesiaency A^ent, the shaikhs of Um-al-Qaivvain, Ac»c*an ana Fujairah to Eiake the Shaikl. of• Dubai see to reason ana not miss a £,ood chance for pemanant settlement v,ere in vain. The Political A&amp;ent tlien oraerea tiiacthe money oblaiiiea from the Shaikh of Dubai should be paia to the shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the camels returned to him ana that both sites shoula withdraw their forces forthwith. This was complieu with but was soon followed by numerous sporadic incicents of can.el looting by both siacs. In most cases, however, the Shaikh of Dubai was taking the initiative but suffering the heaviest loss of life ana property. An effort was later mace by Shaikh Ahmad bin kuhaminad al-I iyayi of Dhank to mediate for the settlement of the dispute but he met with no' success, as the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi v.as suspicious of Shaikh of Dubai*s intentions. Shaikh Rashia bin Sa*ia, the elaest son of the Shaikh of Dubai, is responsible for this unpleasant state of affairs as he has been committing subvv--.iiive acts and dcir^ all he can to cause harm to Abu Dhabi*s interests. He was callea to Bahrain in December where he was ^iven severe warning by the Political A^ent.

Sumiaary of the working gf the Iih^erial - Bank of Iran. Bahrain.- for the year 194i. In our current accounts section over 100 new acc ounts were opened during the year, and the average amount on deposit was several lacs higher than that @f the preceding year. The highest figure on deposit was 41 lacs, about iO lacs in excess of the peak figure of 194S. In the later months of the year there has been a considerable reduction of balances to purchase exchange for imports, which are new steadily arriving in ever-increasing quantities but even with this, the total on deposit at the end of the year, 31 lacs, is still as high as any figure in the previous year: and there has been n© pearl exchange to increase deposits. way of advances in current account, particularly towards the end of the year. Our total operations in foreign exchange including Indian rupees were:- Purchases Rs. 3 ft ,00,000. Sales ' 44,50,000. Sales show an increase ©f some 5 lacs over last year's figures, but purchases are only 37 $ of last year's total. This falling ©ff in purchases was the result entirely ©f the complete absence of pearl exchange this year. There was none on offer, for all the pearls obtained during the past good seasan, are still awai ting purchasers. The failure of the market is attributed mainly to the unsettled state of affairs in India. Several of the pearl merchants have now gene t© India t© seek purchasers personally. We are trying to assist the merchsnts by making enquiries through banking correspondents for possible markets elsewhere. most of which is for the purchase of ^©ods for the island. In normal times the proceeds of the pearl sales would supply more than the demand for funds in India and we should require to with draw the balance in notes from India for local use. Last year oyer 54 lacs were imported in notes and coin. Gash has been easy with us throughout this year and instead of having surplus funds in India to be withdrawn in note remittances, the demand for purchases has been well in advance of the funds offered for sale. We were able to meet the demand from ©ur own funds, without remitting notes, until the last month of the year when we were obliged to repatriate Rs:l ? 00,000 in notes to Karachi to meet customers' purchases. It is possible that we may have to repeat this operation early in the New Year if the dearth of Indian' funds on offer continues. imports, totalling Rs:12,00.000, and received, in addition, bills for collection for Rs;3,20^000 most of which also covered the import of goods into Bahrain. Of these credits and bills the greater part by far is for the U.K. (covering a variety of s oods; piecegoods, hardware, radios, cement, toilet articles', electrical fittings etc.) with Australia taking second place (mainly for food stuffs). This year too has seen the resumption of business with continental Europe, and in the last few months of the year we opened credits with France, Holland and Italy.

The monthly cereal ration was again maintained at 20 lbs. per adult throughout the year, varying in composition however, according to the stocks on hand. For the townships of Manamah, Maharaq and Redd, the cereal issue for the first four months was made up of 4 lbs rice, 4 lbs. millet, and 12 lbs wheat, for the following five months, 8 lbs. of rice, and 12 lbs.wheat, whilst for the remaining three months of the year, the issue was 8 lbs rice, 6 lbs of wheat and 6 lbs. of Persian mixed grains, Persian mixed grains being an admixture of barley and wheat. In the villages the 20 lbs cereal ration also varied considerably, the first six months issue consisting of 4 lbs rice, 4 lbs.flour and 12 lbs of wheat, the following two months 4 lbs rice, 4 lbs. flour, and 12 lbs. Persian mixed grains. For the month of Ramadhan the ration was made up of 8 lbs rice, 4 lbs.Persian mixed grains, and 8 lbs.of wheat, for Shawal, 4 lbs rice, 4 lbs flour, 4 lbs wheat and 8 lbs of Persian mixed grains, whilst for the remaining two months the issue consisted of 4 lbs rice, 4 lbs flour and 12 lbs of Persian mixed grains. Inspite of the varied diets, there were no signs of malnutrition, and the number of dysentery cases even less than the previous year, which had been the smallest on record for a considerable time. It will be noticed that more rice was available than for 1364, this being due to Government being able to obtain at regular intervals a steady supply of this commodity from Persia. As in the case of diet, prices to the public of rice and wheat fluctuated according to the cost of these commodities to the Government. From Mahurrum to Jamad al Than! rice was retailed at Rs 2/- per ruba of 4 lbs, from Rajab to Shawal for Rs l e 12o0 per ruba, and for Dhul Qaada and Dhul Haj at Rs 1.14.0 per ruba. Wheat was retailed at 12 annas per ruba from Mahurrum to Rajab, and at 13 annas per ruba from Shaban to Dhul Haj.• . • ' 2 ‘ All th« abova prices war# again substantially subsidised by the Qovarnment, in an endeavour to keep the cost of living down. The system of food distribution continued smoothly and no serious complaints were received against shop-keepers. The sugar ration for the towns, which for the first five months of the year was 3 lbs per month per adult, was in Jamad al Thani, re duced to 2$ lbs per adult per month, and with the exception of the month of Ramadhan, when the ration was 3$ lbs, remained at that figure ( 2jf ) lbs, till the end of the year. The reduction was necessary and due to a cut in our quota, owing to a shortage of this commodity in India. The village ration was maintained at 1 lb per adult throughout the year. Throughout the year there was a steady flow from Persia into Bahrain of live stock, gram, potatoes, onions, fresh and dried fruits, and of coursa rica and mixad grainse Importers of Dates were given facilities to purchase tea and sugar on the barter system, and this kept the price of dates within the means of the poorer classes - who exist mainly on bread and dates. The issue of cloth to the public by ration cards continued successfully, and during the year 1365, the residents of Manamah, Iteharaq and Hedd received cloth rations in llahurrum, Rablal Awal, Jamad al Awal, and Ramadhan • For the villages, cloth rations were issued in Mahurrum and Jamad al Thani. A further issue is to be made early in the New Year. There is however an extreme shortage of white long cj.oth and white mulls, generally used during the summer months. Representation was made to the Government of India through His Britannic Majesty's Political Agency Bahrain, for an increase in our non-grey quota, at the expense of our grey quota, and it is hoped that before the summer of next year, there will be a sufficiency of these types of cloth to issue out a suitable ration. During the second half of 1365, more and more consumer goods began to arrive her. from the United Kingdom, United States, and India, and it is hoped if the quantities increase sufficiently to relax price control on as many articles as possible in the ^During 1365, pric« control was removed from Cigar«tt«s, Toilat articles, and Patent medicines* Black Market operators, who had been active in most commodities, received a severe setback towards the end of the year, when the Authorities adopted a much stronger attitude towards them, several sentences of imprisionment having the desired effect of stopping to a large extent this activity. One result was the almost immediate request by a large number of people for ration cards. With the releasing of controls in India and elsewhere on certain commodities, more goods were allov/ed for export from Bahrain, this with a view to encourage and revive trade. / Smuggling of piece goods, 4n the main, continued and many arrests were made by Police and Customs Officials.

QATAR In April 1946 operations in Qatar were recommenced with the re-opening of Dukhan Camp and the work of rehabilitation began with a view to the resumption of drilling towards the end of the year. In October 1946, however, came a major change of plans when it was decided to expedite production from Qatar, January 1949 being the provisional date for export to commence. Early decisions were imperative on such questions as teiminal oil dock site, location of pipeline, pipeline road, unloading points for heavy equipment and location of a permanent camp. Preliminary general surveys were carried out in November and it was soon agreed in principle that the following propositions should be examined with a view to subsequent construction if found practicable after the necessary detailed marine and land surveys (a) a terminal oil dock in the vicinity of El Arrif, some 15 miles north of Khor Odaid. (b) a jetty in the vicinity of Wakrah to be used by pilots. (c) a new boat harbour on the west coast near El Hamlah, some 22 miles south of Zekrit. (d) a permanent camp near this boat harbour. (e) a road from approximately (c) across the peninsula to Wakrah with forks to El Arrif and Doha. (This road and the subsequent pipeline would coincide as far as physically possible). Reference (a) H.M.S. 'Challenger' commenced to survey the approaches to Wakrah and El Arrif in December 1946 and some months* work is anticipated. At the end of the year under review plans were in hand for urgent surveys of all the above propositions. 2. GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION - QATAR A Seismic Party had been arranged to commence work in Qatar in the autumn of 1946. Personnel and equipment, however, were delayed by the seamen*s strikes in America. It is aiticipated, however, that work will start in January 1947. 3. TRUCIAL COAST Work on the Trucial Coast during 1946 was confined to geological exploration. In the first part of the year surface geology was carried out in the following areas Jabal Eaiyah Kalb a Jabal Hafit Baraimi Oasis Part of Oman Range to the East of Baraimi and Hafit- 2 - In the autumn an extensive programme including magnetometer gravimeter and topographical surveys wmm commenced and was still being carried out at the end of the year under review.

The information supplied by His Highness is attached (marked Apendix A*). (b) Water Exploration : In compliance with a wish expressed by His Highness for an examination of the water possibilities in the Batinah area the Company provided a party under a Company geologist, Mr.T.l.Williamson, to conduct the necessary examination.

During the year a number of Policemen left the force on termination of their period of agreement. Rates of pay were slightly raised and a messing allowance was granted in lieu of rations. An effort was made to enlist a dozen young educated men of good families for training as police officer cadets. Although over 30 candidates offered themselves only five of these proved suitable, the majority of them failed to pass the medical test. Many naturs resigned or were discharged during the year, their places being filled in most cases by temporary appointments. The demand for labour, at high rates of pay, continued and men who would otherwise join the Police or naturs find more atraction in short term employment than in enlisting in the State force for a four year period. Towards the end of the year the situation changed somewhat and recruitment recommenced. The state of public security was good apart from an epidemic of thefts in Manama, mostly from houses occupied by single Indians. There were two serious cases during the year, a Persian was murdered by an Omani and an Iraqi attempted to murder a prostitute/r ® 8 and then killed himself. Smuggling decreased and there was a drop in black market dealing after the courts took strong action in several cases of contravention of the price control regulations. In 143 traffic accidents 5 persons were killed and 17 persons were seriously injured. The use of opium and liquor increased and a number of cases of hashish smoking were detected. Eashish was not previously available in Bahrain. The use of liquor, which is forbidden in Bahrain, increased; spirits such as whisky, brandy and gin found their way to the black market and were used as well as date arrak. The question of liquor is assuming serious dimensions, in spite of the very high prices which are charged for it an ever increasing number of young Arabs belonging to well to do families have taken to drinking. 3. Administration. Nothing to report. Detailed reports on the season have not yet reached me. The season was a successful one, divers, Nakhudas and Tajjaars had a prosperous year. Though the number of boats was small, restricted by the lack of new craft which was due to the absence of timber, prices remained at a high level and it is anticipated that the value of the catch was greater than during the last season. Recruits are still coming forward to work as divers, mostly sons of old divers from Muharraq and Hedd, but young men who have been educated at the Government schools have given up making diving their profession• / * ?. Public Works . An extension was built to the Manama palace consisting of six rooms with verandas and new garages3 /S Four houses for married teachers were constructed at the eastern side of the Manama Primary School playing ground. A new European private ward with bathroom etc. was added to the State hospital and an additional private ward on the ground floor was built. The creek on the western side of the customs pier was reclaimed, by stone filling, and work was commenced on the foundations of the site of the new customs sheds. The existing import shed is to be dismantled and a line of shops are to be built on the site of it. A stretch of metalled road was constructed between Manama and the Municipal boundary, this was of an experi mental nature to cope with excessive moisture which is one of the main causes of trouble on the roads. Municipalities . The work of the Municipalities in 1946 was again restricted as it was in the previous year to usual work of town cleaning and widening and surfacing roads. No ^work of importance was carried out. The Municipalities continued to co-operate with the Food Control Department in the work of rationing foodstuffs as usual. 7. / Agriculture . Two large areas of land adjoining the Budeya garden were put under cultivation. At Jida island additional land was cultivated and irrigated from the new artesian well which was sunk at the end of 1945. prices of gardens and leases of gardens remained high. The amount of land under cultivation in Bahrain is steadily increasing as landlords find that they can obtain good prices for lucerne, dates and vegetables.4 -)&lt;■&gt; © —4 8, Electric Department . Adviserate D.O. No. 319-12L dated 9th January 1947, j?efers. 9 p -'' Administration of Justice . The changes which were made in the courts during the previous year resulted in a big reduction in the number of pending cases and a general speeding up in the work of the courts. During the first half of the year there were many criminal cases and offences against price control regulations. These decreased towards the end of the year. 10. Education. No. of Schools in existence on 1.1.46 15 No. of Schools opened during 1946 No. of Schools closed during 1946 No. of students on 1.1.46 2736 No. of students on 31.12.46 3178 No. of teachers on 1.1.46 137 No. of teachers on 31.12.46 156 Boys T Schools . All schools were filled to capacity during the year and at trie beginning of the term several hundred boys were refused admission as there was neither accommodation or a sufficiency of teaching st^ff to cope with more students. Demand for education is growing, especially in the towns. The few private schools which exist are also full. In the Government Schools the standard of education is improving and compares with that of ix* schools in 3gypt, Syria and Iraq. A new Secondary School building was constructed above one of the Primary Schools in Manama and the old Secondary School was absorbed into the Hostel. At the beginning of the term 19 Egyptian teachers, selected by the British Council in Cairo, were enlisted for duty in Bahrain. 5/5 @ / Twenty Bahrain boys v/ho were studying in Cairo were withdrawn from there. It was considered undesirable for them to continue to live in Cairo under the present disturbed political conditions. Three of the best of these boys were sent to the American University of Beirut at the expense of the Bahrain Government, A number of the others were sent by their parents to Beirut and elsewhere. Those who did not continue their education abroad found posts in Bahrain. Mr. Ahmed Omran continued to act as Director of Education, during the summer, while on leave^ he visited England under the auspices of the British Council and was shown as much as possible English Schools and places of educational interest. Girls 1 Schools . No new Girls’ Schools were opened during 1946. The needlework in all the schools was put under the direction of a needlework head mistress and ajr special needlework teacher was appointed in each school. Many students were refused owing to lack of rooms, staff and equipment. Eighteen students took their school leaving certificatqs. Technical School. The increase in students was due to the development of the school by opening a section for motor repairing and electric welding. An ex student who completed two years at a Technical school in Egypt was taken on the staff to replace an Egyptian teacher who resigned and several local teachers were enlisted. Attendance and health was good. The school now provides classes in carpentry, fitting, blacksmiths’ work, turning, welding and motor repairing.11. General. Various members of the Ruling Family visited iSsypt and the Levant during the year and several young men from Bahrain went to England to make contact with commercial firms. The demand for labour still persisted and no unemployment existed. Children at schools appeared to be physically fitter, well fed and well clothed, an indication of local conditions. Land and house values remained at their high level but there was no increase in the value of house property owing mainly to the regulation restricting house rents. This regulation also reduced the amount of new private building except in the case of buildings contracted for by foreign firms. The difficulty in obtaining cotton yarn from India seriously affected the small local cotton weaving industry, in the villages on the south-west coast of Ba.hr ain.'Is Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain. The 15th of January, 1947. /Ju^ With reference to your No.c/1438 of 29th December I forward herewith the information requested. (a) Number of out-door patients 14,526 27 750 (b) ' ' in-door n (c) ” ' operations (all minor surgical operations) (d) No epidemic of any of the major infectious diseases occurred during the year. Mumps SfiMritjc (Parotitis) occurred as an epidemic of moderate severity, there were 106 cases for this year. Measles and Chicken Pox also occurred, 19 of .the former, 8 of the latter. All the minor epidemic diseases were mere attacks, there was only one case with complications in respect of mumps. The incidence of malaria decreased from 3796 for 1945 to 2683 for 1946. This is undoubtedly due to the anti-malarial measures carried out by the Bahrain Government. Many of the cases were relapses of old infections, as the local populace seldom if ever submit to a complete course of treatment. (e) Small pox. There were 21 cases reported and quarantined for the year under report, out of which four were not Bahrainis and had probably contracted the disease in the mainland from where they came. This disease has steadily continued to decrease since 1941, as the following figures show:- 1941 119 cases (September to December) 1942 193 i» 1943 43 it 1944 56 tt (including 7 imported cases) 1945 15 tt 1946 21 tt ( 4 ft Tt ) and the The people appear to appreciate the value of vaccination attend the hospital voluntarily for vaccination which was not case before.

DateTHE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED 1946 ANNUAL REPORT mmumm The activities of The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited in the Sheikhdom of Bahrein during the year 1946 are reviewed in this report and brief details covering the operation of the Producing Field, Refinery and related facilities are presented. During the year facilities which permit the direct loading and unloading of oceangoing ships at Sitra were completed and placed In operation. The refinery was operated at maxi mum crude oil running capacity during the year and toward the end of the year construction was commenced on facilities for the manufacture of asphaltic products. Tabulations are presented showing i 1) The status of all oil, gas and water wells as of December 31, 1946. 2) The monthly oil production and daily average water production during the year. 3) The purpose, sise and type of buildings standing as of December 31* 1946. 4) The nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity &gt; of the Company in Bahrein on December 31# 1946. The location of wells, camps, pump stations, pipelines, roads, refinery and miscellaneous facilities are shown on the mpa included with this report.2 PRODUCING FIELD FIELD DEVELOPMENT &amp; WELL REPAIR jjgMBBtti Field development was resumed during the year and seven new veils have been completed or nearly completed. The drilling of these veils is part of a program undertaken to (1) replace veils captured by the expanding gas cas and advancing edge water thus assuring the field's ability to sustain current production rates 9 (2) redistribut withdrawal from the reservoir to assure maximum economic recovery! (3) increase rate and improve distribution of injected gas* and (4) permit further observation of the effects of production practice on the reservoir. Two of the veils already completed in this program vere drilled solely for gas injection purposes! one to Second Pay Limestone and one to Second Pay Silts tone! and are now in operation. Three veils have been finished as dual completions to produce selectively from Second Pay Limestone and Second Pay Silts tone and two veils are in the process of being similarly completed. A total of twelve veils are included in the current program! four of which will be completed to serve the dual purpose of producing selectively from First Pay and observing the advance of edge water in Second Pay Limestone on the flanks of the structure. REPAIR : A number of veils are standing awaiting major repairs before they can be returned to production but this work has been held in abeyance to permit a more rapid advance in the current development program. Minor repair work necessary for the maintenance of important wells and the protection of oil reserves has been carried out10 PRODUCTIOK Oil production from the field during 1946 totalled 8 9 009»B02 net barrels* an average of 21*945 net barrels daily. Total net oil production and daily average by months is given in Tabulation No.H. Field production rate mas increased during the year as additional wells and gas injection facilities provided in the development program mere completed. The increase In gas Injection rate afforded by the provision of additional gas injection wells has resulted in the ability to control the influx of extraneous water into the reservoir thus permitting this higher rate of withdrawal. The field was being produced at the rate of 25*000 net barrels daily at the end of the year. As previously mentioned in this report* two additional gas injection wells were drilled during the year and facilities were provided to permit the injection of additional quantities of Fourth Pay Zone 'E' gas into the main First and Second Pay producing horizons. Gas for this purpose being supplied, as in past years* through Veil No.51« Gas injection to First Pay through Well No.62 has remained at a constant rate while injection rate to Second Pay through Well No.63* 75 and 78 (the latter two being the new wells) has been increased. Veil Nos. 63 and 75 are completed to inject into Second Pay Limestone Zone 'A' and Veil No.78 is completed to inject into Second Pay Siltstone Zone 'C'. Injection rates were regulated to retard edge water advance on the basis of past observations and as more data is collected the rate will be further increased until the optimum rate is determined. The beneficial effect of the increased injection irate is discemable in the maintenance of reservoir pressure and edge water control.GAS EWSCTKBJ (Continued) 11 &lt;§&gt; Four additional veils on the crest of the structure were captured by the expanding gas cap during the year necessitating a reduction In the rate of production froo the individual veils concerned. Periodic observations of the level of the gas-oil contact in Second Pay. Limestone Indicates that it is receding at a satisfactory uniform rate. wuimjtmvMKi' Total vater production for the year averaged 1520 barrels per day as compared vith a daily averag e of 1201 barrels in 1945* This increase in total vater production is largely due to the increase in production rate but it is of interest to note that the rate of vater production, expressed as a percentage of total vlthdrawal, has increased from only 6.2% at the beginning of the year to 6.4£ at the end. This rate of increase of vater production is less than observed in previous years and is one of the beneficial effects of the current gas injection practice.

In maintaining the five oil-gathering stations in a satisfactory operating condition the roofs of eight tanks were replaced. The roofs of an additional three tanks are scheduled for replacement. mini aumjw The pipe line from Saudi Arabia has operated satisfactorily throughout the year and 25,019,061 net barrels of crude were delivered through it. An additional 662,224 net barrels of Arabian crude were delivered by tanker through Sitra Maxine Terminal making a total of 25,^61,285 net barrels of Arabian crude received in the Refinery during the year. EXPLORATION CF AflDITIQMAL. .ABSA Exploration work within the Additional Area was resumed towards the end of the year and the drilling of one structure hole has been completed. Preparations are under way for the drilling of additional structure holes from specially constructed drilling piers in the open waters of the Gulf.13 P REFINING OPERA T IONS Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput and crude runs during the year 1946 totalled 33»989&gt;452 barrels* Shipments of produets during the year were as follows t *As mentioned in our previous report&gt; a quantity of Aviation Gasoline had been sold to the United States Navy and of this, 230,236 barrels remained in our storage tanks at Sitra at the start of the year* Of this amount 228,887 barrels, which are included in the above figure, were shipped the difference between these two figures being normal storage loss* In addition to the above shipments, the Company also shipped 118,275 tons of petroleum coke, which had been produced in prior year's refining operations. As the demand for aviation gasoline had dropped rapidly with the end of the war very little aviation gasoline was produced during the year, and except for one short run the facilities for manufacturing this product remained closed down. The balance of the refining facilities continued operating at capacity.

CAMP FACILITIES AWALI Increased numbers of personnel has necessitated increased housing in Awali. The 20,2-bedroom houses started in 1945 have been completed and 13 additional 2-bedroom houses are in the course of construction* Three house shells have been built for storage of materials for further houses| these will be converted to living quarters later. The increased number of families has necessitated a 2-room extension to the Awali school. The 52 room bunkhouse is no longer required for living quarters and is being converted to a native hospital} the bathhouse has been demolished and a new wing added. The Messhall has been extended to include a wing for boys washroom and locker roomIt has been necessary to increase the size of the laundry to handle increased dry-cleaning requirements. ZELLAQ In order to supply more water for the drilling program and the additional Aw&amp;ll facilities, three pumps were installed• A steel frame and translte pump shed was erected.

POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. No.C/207. The 16th February, 1947. From Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain . To The ({on'ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith, in triplicate, the Administration Report for Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast for the year 1946. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. political Agent, Bahrain. NS. I f \ i-3- 3, AL KHALIFAH &gt; His Higimess Shaiich Salman continued to take a keen interest in the administration of the State. He continued his urging of.the Bahrain petroleum Company to extract more oil, and also expressed anxiety that the pearling industry had not recovered the ground lost during the war. He is anxious to raise the standard of secondary education in Bahrain, and to this end has asked for the services of a British Director of Education and a British Headmaster for the Manama Secondary School. In February His Highness personally inspected the site where the new customs sheds are to be erected, and visited the power house in April to start the new 206 KW generating set which had arrived at the end of last year. He wants visitors to carry away a good impression of Bahrain. When he met Lord Pethick Lawrence on the latter’s return from India in June he expatiated at some length on the good government and general prosperity that were to be found in Bahrain. Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa al Khalifah, senior uncle of His Highness, paid his usual visits to Egypt during the year, the last one being June-September. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., went on a number of shooting trips during the year. He visited the mainland on two of these trips. In February Shaikh Salman bin Mohammed bin Isa arrived from Jerusalem where he had been studying law. He was appointed a magistrate of the Bahrain Court in April. A son of His Highness and a son of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed were among those persons operated on by sir Henry Holland when he visited Bahrain in November. 4. EDUCATION. (i) Number of schools in existence on 1.1. ’- 46 15 Number of schools in existence on 31.12 . *46 . 15 Number of students on 1.1. ’46 2,736 Number of students on 31.12. »46 3,178 Number of teachers on 1.1.’46 137 Number of teachers on 31.12.’46 156 (ii) Boys’ Schools . All the schools were filled to capacity during /the year....( (tf) -4- the year, and at the beginning of the term several hundred were refused admission as there was neither accommodation nor enough dst&amp;jkax teachers. Demand for education is growing, especially in the towns, and the few private schools which exist are also full. in the Government schools the standard of educa tion is good and compares favourably with that of schools in Egypt, Syria and 'Iraq. A new secondary school building was built in Manama, and the old secondary school building was made part of the hostel. At the beginning of the term 19 Egyptian teachers, selected by the British council in Cairo, were added to the teaching staff. The twenty Bahrain students studying in Cairo were brought back to Bahrain because of the political conditions and because they showed little progress. ^ Three of the best of them were later sent at Government expense to the American University at Beirut, and some of the others were also sent there by their parents. Those who did not continue their education abroad found posts in Bahrain. An attempt was made by the British Council to provide a Director of Education, but nothing came of this effort and Mr. Ahmed Omran continued to officiate in this capacity. He visited England under the auspices of the British council during the summer and was shown as much as possible of English schools and places of educational interest. (iii) GIRLS' SCHOOLS . No new girls' schools were opened in 1946, and many students were refused admission owing to lac* of accommodation, staff and equipment. A special needle work teacher was appointed for each school, and a special needlework mistress appointed to superintend the work in ^ all the schools. Eighteen students took their school leaving certi ficates . (iv) TECHNICAL SCHOOL . A section for motor repairing and electric welding was opened this year, and there was an increase in the number of students in consequence. The school also pro vides classes in carpentry, ;fitting, blacksmith's work, and turning. Several local teachers were enlisted. 5. AGRICULTURE . Two large plots of land adjoining the Manama Municipal garden were brought under cultivation, and at Jidda Island more land wits cultivated and irrigated from the new artesian well which was sunk at the end of 1945. The amount of land under cultivation is steadily increasing as landlords find that they can obtain good • /prices-5- prices for lucerne, dates, and vegetables. 6. MUNICIPALITIES . No public work of major importance was carried out this year,the work of the Municipalities being restricted as in 1945 to town cleaning, the widening and re-surfacing of roads, and co-operating with the Food Control Department in the rationing of foodstuffs. 7. PUBLIC WORKS . Six rooms and several garages were added to the Manama Palace. Four houses for married teachers were constructed at the eastern end of the Manama primary School playing ground. A new European private ward was added to the State Hospital and an additional private ward built on the ground floor. The creek on the western side of the Customs pier has been filled^and a beginning made with laying the foundations of the new Customs Sheds. The old import shed which is situated in the market is to be dismantled and the site used for shops. As an experimental measure a stretch of metalled road was constructed from Manama to the Municipal boundary to overcome the excessive moisture which is the cause of many road accidents. The Bahrain Government have contracted with Messrs. Holloway Brothers for the installation of a town water supply in Manama. Water will be distributed through a ring-main round Manama feeding a sub-main with extensions to private consumers, public wash-houses, and street hydrants. The pumping plant, consisting of three sets of pumps and storage tanks, will be located in the Municipal Garden where there is a good supply of water. Two new artesian wells are being sunk in the garden. The scheme provides for the erection of a pump house and water storage tanks, and the laying of over 15 miles of asbestos cement piping, it will cost approximately £64,000 and it is estimated will take at least 18 months to complete. 8. ELiilCTHICITY DEPARTMENT. (i) New Installations . The installation of the new 206 KW generating set which arrived at the end of 1945 was completed in April. The Shaikh officially set it working. It operated at 90# of its capacicy for long periods throughout the year, it has been run on an open circuit owing to the difficulty in obtaining equipment for a closed circuit cooling system, resulting in a daily distilled water consumption of 1,400 gallons instead of the 90 gallons that would be used in a closed circuit. As this water had to be brought by road- tanker from jufair it added considerably to generating costs. (ii) Extension to the power Supply . During the year connection was given to a new B.O.A.C. 100 KW sub-station, new stores and machine tool workshops, /thethe new wing of the Manama palace, residential quarters for employees of the Bahrain Government, residential quarters for employees of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., 4 new flour mills, and about 116 private consumers. An increased demand by petroleum concessions Limited for the air conditioning for their staff and office premises was also met. (iii) New Agreement with the R.A.F . In May the Bahrain Government concluded a new electricity agreement with the Air Ministry under which they became responsible for the supply of electricity in an emergency to the Royal Air Force at Muharraq, and regularly to the various B.O.A.C. installations in Manama. (iv) At the invitation of the Amir Saud bin Abdulla bin Jalawi of Hassa the State Engineer visited Hofuf in March to advise on the electrification of that town. 9. TbLEPHONE PEPARfMENT . No progress has been made with the scheme for an automatic telephone system and the Bahrain public have had to suffer for another year from the accumulated defects of the obsolete equipment still in use. Messrs. Cable and Wireless experienced some difficulty in acquiring suitable sites in Manama and Muharraq for the main arid satellite exchanges, but were assisted by this Agency in obtaining the sites required. In September, however, the Company informed the Bahrain Government that an automatic system could not be installed and offered a new magneto system instead. Shaikh Salman felt that he had been let down by the Company and replied that unless the Company were prepared to carry out their original proposal, he would invite another firm to undertake installation. The question was still under consideration by the London Office of Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless at the end of the year. 10. PEARLING . Detailed reports have not yet been received, but prices remained at a high level and the value of the catch was greater than that of last year. Divers, nakhudas, and pearl merchants had a good season, but owing to the unsettled state of the Indian market many of the pearls obtained were still unpurchased at the end of the year. There were fewer boats in commission largely because the absenc.e of timber restricts the building of new craft, and many old boats are now unsafe. New divers are still coming forward from among the sons of old divers, but many have been educated at the various schools and no longer make diving their trade. 11. CUSTOMS . Customs revenue from all sources, amounted to Rs.28.83,410 an increase of Rs.2,85,312 over the previous year. There were 116 launches registered with the customs on the 31st December, 1946. 12. FOOD CONTROL . Despite the cessation of hostilities there was no apparent improvement in the food position during the /year/ear under review, and the Bahrain Government had again to spend a large sum of money, Rs.10,600,000 in purchasing essential foodstuffs. The monthly cereal ration was maintained at last year’s level, varying in composition, however, according to the stocks in hand. More rice was available than in 1945 because the Government was able to obtain supplies of Persian rice at regular intervals. The cloth rationing system was successfully maintained and cloth was issued to the villagers twice in the year and to the towns of Manama and Muharraq five times in the year. (The reason for this differentiation is not known). There is, however, an extreme shortage of white longcloth and white mulls for summer wear. ' During the second half of the period under review ^U.S.A. consumer goods began to arrive from the United Kingdom^/in and India increasing quantities. It is hoped to relax price control on as many articles as possible in 1947. It has already been removed from luxury articles. The re-export from Bahrain of more goods was allowed to encourage trade. Black-market operators were active but several of the racketeers were fined and imprisoned. This has had a deterrent effect and one result has been that many more people have applied for ration cards. There was still no sign of any downward trend in prices in 1946. 13. GRIPPING . The following is a statement of ships that called during the year 1946s- British 256 American 199 Norwegian 40 Dutch 25 Panaraerican 20 Swedish 10 Danish - 7 Italian 6 Canadian 3 566 Phe total imports for the year amounted to 51,825 tons and exports to 192,375 tons of which 184,908 tons were petroleum coke. 14. ACCIDENTS WITHIN PORT LIMITS . On the 9th February, 1946, a foreign dhow bound for the port of Doha with a cargo of 400 gallas of dates and 12 tins of date juice sank north of Muharraq. All the cargo was lost and the craft became a wreck. On the same day a Persian vessel was wrecked at Sayeh near Fasht al Adham. The cargo was lost but the crew was saved. /On the 29th-8- On the 29th October, 1946, a local country craft with 400 bags of cement from the B.I.S.N. Company’s ship 'Vasna' capsized, and was wrecked opposite the Customs pier at Manama. The cargo was later recovered. On the 2nd November, 1946, a local country craft with a cargo of 350 bags of cement was sunk near Chas Chose shoal. The cargo was lost but the craft was salvaged and repaired. 15. THE PORT OF DAHHAIN . (i) Extension of R.E. System . Early this year it was suggested to the Bahrain Government that Bahrain might be made a free port. It was thought that the Aden bonded warehouse system could be applied to Bahrain, but on further examination of the Aden regulations it was found that before the system could be introduced a considerable revision of import and export duties would-be necessary. It was decided instead to extend facilities under the existing R.E. system. As soon as the new Customs sheds have been completed the R. E. period is to be increased from 20 to 90 days, and the system extended to ail Gulf ports. (11) Survey of Manama Anchorage . Masters of vessels calling at Bahrain have long considered it unsafe to use the inner anchorage at Manama if they drew more than 22 feet. In December, however, the S. 3. ”Saminver ,, arrived from Canada with 9,000 tons of wheat and though drawing 27 feet came right into the anchorage. Her master reported that for the length of the course he had never less than 32 feet under him and had ample water at his anchorage. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie thereupon raised the question of a further survey of the Manama anchorage. The Bahrain Government expressed their willingness to contribute towards the expenses of a survey. (HI) Loading and Unloading Arrangements . During the year the Bahrain General Merchants’ Association expressed their dissatisfaction with the loading and unloading arrangements of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie. They complained that cargo was badly stowed and roughly handled, and that no discrimination was made between the different kinds of cargo. The company have taken notice of this complaint and have instructed their stevedores to exercise more care. At the same time they pointed out, justly enough, that the Manama pier did not possess the modern equipment necessary for off-loading cargo. There was only one hand crane, a slow and antique piece of mechanism. The Bahrain Government confirmed that they had asked for quotations for a new crane but that no firm offer had been received by them. New landing craft and equipment are badly needed and Messrs. Gray Mackenzie have taken up the matter with their Bombay office. (iv) Lighting &amp; Buoying . L. T. ’’Nearchus” made her usual visits of inspection /during-9- during the year. The beacons on the Khasifa and Saya Islets off Muharraq were found damaged and in view of the difficulty of repairing them and the fact that there are several conspicuous objects ashore near both these islets, the beacons are no longer being maintained. On the night of the 17th August the S.S. 'Pitt River' en route to Italy with a full cargo of Bapco petroleum products ran aground on the Shah Allam Shoal. After discharging part of the cargo she was refloated and continued her voyage. Earlier in the year the U.S. Navy tanker 'Cacapon' ran aground on the same shoal. The Lighting and Buoying Committee had under considera tion the adequate lighting of this shoal. 16. POST OFFICE . The following officials held charge as Sub postmaster in 1946;- Mr. Rajab Ali 1st January to 31st May. Mr. Rahraatullah 1st June to 28th October. Mr. Devanchand Sharma 29th October to 31st December They were assisted by 4 clerks, 3 postmen and one packer.

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE . (i) Agency Courts . Civil and criminal suits entertained during the year totaled 1,666 and 412 respectively, as compared with-10- 1,129 and 405 last year. A separate report has been sent to the political Resident. (ii) Local Courts. A number of changes in procedure were introduced at the end of 1945 and this made for a big reduction.in the number of pending cases and a general speeding up in the work of the courts. Thei\e were many criminal and profiteering cases in the first half ot the year, but they decreased noticeably in the latter half. 18. POLICE. Strength on Strength on 1.1. ’46. 31.12. »46.

Rates of pay were slightly raised and a messing allowance was granted in lieu of rations. Many naturs also resigned or were discharged, and their places were filled by temporary appointments. Men who would otherwise have joined the State forces were attracted by the higher wages paid to labour and preferred short term employment to'a four year period of enlistment. An effort was made to enlist a dozen young men of good families for training as police officer cadets. Over 30 candidates offered themselves but only five proved suitable, the majority of them failing to pass the medical test. The houses of a humber of Indian residents of Manama were burgled during the early part of the year, but apart from this public security was good. Smuggling decreased, and there was a drop in black-market activities after several cases had been brought before the .courts. Five persons were killed in traffic accidents and 17 seriously injured. 19. ECONOMIC . (i) Trade . Imports increased and there was a large and steady demand irom the public for all classes of goods, particularly piecegoods. Difficulty was experienced by /importers....-11- n&gt; importers because of the lack of shipping space, and this forced the banks, to extend credit to importers. The greater part oftthis trade was with the United Kingdom and covered a variety of articles including piecegoods, hard ware, radios, cement, toilet articles, electrical fittings, toy, shoes, biscuits, etc., etc. Australian imports took second place and consisted mainly of foodstuffs. During the year a small number of young Bahrainis went to the United Kingdom to make contacts with commercial firms. There was also a resumption of business with continental Europe, and in the last few months of the year credits were opened by local banks with France, Holland and Italy. (ii) Banking Exchange . Apart from Indian funds, exchange rates were steady and remained so throughout the year. The Indian market depends greatly on the sale of pearls, and as the pearl market was dull the sale of Indian bills fluctuated from 3% discount in January to It discount in December. There was a large demand for foreign exchange. Considerable quantities of uncurrent silver rupees and other silver coins were shipped to India. Local stocks of uncurrent coins appear to be exhausted. Sovereigns were exported to ’Iraq and Egypt. The Eastern Bank continued to have by far the largest share in banking activities but the Imperial Bank of Persia also had a satisfactory year, in the latter bank over a hundred new accounts were opened. (iii) industry . The difficulty in obtaining cotton yarn from India during the year under review seriously affected the local cotton weaving industry which is carried on in the villages on the south-west coast of Bahrain. During the latter part of the year Mr. Hussain Agar, a Persian business man and the owner of a cotton mill in Bushire, visited Bahrain with the object of start ing a cotton mill on the Island. After some discussion with the Bahrain Government he broke off negotiations and left Bahrain. (iv) property . Land and house values remained at a high level. In September the Government brought into force a new Rent Regulation and as a result values were stabilized and there was no increase in the price of house property. The appli cation of this regulation to shop rents is under considera tion. 20. MEDICAL . i (i) General . The health of the community is reported to have improved during the year under review, due, in large part, to a mild summer, and to the increasing sanitary and anti- /malarial/ malarial measures carried out by the Bahrain Government. There still are,however, some 80,000 out-patients treated every year. This number i$ alarmingly high. There were no major epidemics, and there was a marked decrease in malaria, only 6.5# of the population in Manama being affected. There was a small outbreak of small-pox in the early part of the year but it was quickly controlled. A Public Health and Welfare Committee composed of the doctors of the three Manama hospitals, and the Secre taries of the Manama and Muharraq Municipalities has been set up, and has already done good work in tightening up sanitary measures and improving the medical facilities available to the public. Sir Henry Holland, K.C.I.E., of the C.M.S., Quetta, visited Bahrain during the latter part of the year. He performed 35 eye operations and saw 150 patients. (ii) Victoria Memorial Hospital . Dr. M.L.A. Steele held charge throughout the year. Number of out-patients treated 14,526 M M in-patients treated 27 ' ' minor operations 750 Malaria . Total number of patients treated was 2,683 as compared with 3,806 cases for 1945. Venereal Disease. 1945. 1946. Gonorrhea 115 258 Soft Chancre 26 16 Syphilis ... 233 119 (iii) American Mission Hospital . Dr. Paul W. Harrison held charge during the early part of the year and was assisted by Doctors Mylrea, Storm and George. While he was on leave from Bahrain Dr. Storm officiated. Out-patients treated 18,234 in-patients treated 1,973 Minor operations 2,500 Major operations 750 (iv) State Medical Hospital . The setting up of a nursing home in the hospital fills a long-felt need, private wards for men, and women have also been instituted. A special Trachoma clinic was formed to treat boys from the Manama School Hostel daily for six months. This experiment has shown promising results. ■ /MEN —(/ 2 ? -13- ^ . MEN. Out-patients treated 32,396 In-patients treated 1,961 Major operations 5.13 Minor operations. 2,981 WOMEN AND CHILDREN . Out-patients treated 9,709 In-patients treated 785 Major operations 331 SERVICE WAR PS . The Royal Air Force wards in the Bahrain Government Hospital were handed back to the Bahrain Government on the 15th of January, and all patients and R.A.F. equipment in those wards were removed to the R.A.F. SIcji quarters at Muharraq. (v) QUARANTINE . Dr. M.L.A. Steele was in charge as Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. Shipping . No change was made in the quarantine arrangements for Manama, but all vessels calling at Sitra now inform the Quarantine Medical Officer direct by radio telegram of their last port of call and whether they have any infectious disease on board. The system is working well and messages from vessels intending to call at Sitra are received regularly. 566 vessels called at Bahrain as against 394 which called in 1945. Muharraq Aerodrome . Information of the arrival of civil aircraft with passengers is sent to the Quarantine Medical Officer. The actual time of arrival is phoned by the Officer Commanding, R.A.F., to the Passport Officer who, in turn, informs the Quarantine Medical Officer. B.O.A.C. Flying Boat Base. Manama . Cases of illness among passengers disembarking at Bahrain or en route to another destination are reported to the Quarantine Medical Officer by telephone. A supply of yellow fever vaccine was received during the year and an inoculation system organised. There are, however, no quarantine arrangements for yellow fever on the island and no person suffering from yellow fever or arriving in a technically infected aircraft is allowed to land. Infectious Diseases . The station is still function ing as an infectious Disease Hospital for the major infectious diseases. There were 21 cases of small pox and 8 cases of chicken pox with 98 contacts treated and accommodated during 1946. The incidence of small pox since 1941 has continued to decline as the following figures show:- f Year. Number of cases. 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 193 (September to December) 119 43 57 14 21 (including 4 imported cases) /The station-14- i The station is still without a Steam Disinfector - the State medical Officer, Bahrain, is arranging to get one when the price is reasonable. 21. THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY . (a) General Management . Mr. /yard P. Anderson was General Manager and chief Local Representative of the company at the beginning of the year. In March he left for the United States to taite up a post in the New York Office of the company, and was succeeded as General Manager and chief Local Representative by Mr. Russell M* Brown. Mr. W.R. Pinckard, President of the Bahrain petroleum company, visited Bahrain in April, and Mr. Don J. Hanna, a Vice-President of the Company in October and November. ' (b) production and Development . Total oil produced during the year was 8,009,802 net barrels, an average of 21,945 net barrels daily. Production rate was increased during the year as additional wells and gas injection facilities were completed. The extra facilities provided resulted in the ability to control the influx of extraneous water into the reservoir thus per mitting a higher rate of withdrawal. By the end of the year under review the production capacity of the field had increased to 25,000 net barrels a day. The facilities commenced last year to permit the direct loading and unload ing of ocean-going ships at Sitra were completed and brought into operation. (c) Producing Field . Field Development work was resumed and seven new wells were completed during the year. The drilling of these wells was part of a programme undertaken to (i) replace wells captured by the expanding gas and advancing edge water thus assuring the field’s ability to sustain current production rates; (ii) re-distribute withdrawal from the reservoir to assure maximum economic recovery; (ill) increase rate and improve distribution of injected gas; and (iv) permit further observation of the effects of production practice on the reservoir. A number of wells were awaiting major repairs before they • could be returned to production, but the repairs were held in abeyance to permit a more rapid advance in the current development programme of sinking new wells. (d) Imports of Arabian American Crude Oil . The pipe line from Saudi Arabia operated satis factorily throughout the year. The total import of Arabian American crude into Bahrain during the year amounted to /25,881,235n ' t -15- 25,881,285 net barrels as against a total of 15,649,272 for 1945. The figure for this year, given above, includes 862,224 net barrels of crude delivered by tanker through the Sicra Marine Terminal.' (e) Exploration Work . Exploration work within the Additional Area was resumed towards the end of the year and the drilling of one structure hole has been completed. At the end of the year preparations were under way for the drilling of additional structure holes from specially constructed drilling piers in the open waters of the Gulf. (f) Refining Operations . Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput and crude runs during the year totaled 33,989,452 barrels. Shipments of products during the year were as follows: Aviation Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Oil Fuel Oil 417,342 Barrels. 7,940,605 ' 4,088,907 ' 6,478,022 « 12,309,322 ' 31,234,698 Barrels. In addition to the above shipments 118,275 tons of coke produced in the previous year’s operations were also shipped. Very little aviation gasoline was produced during the year as the demand for it had dropped with the end of che war. Except for one short run the facilities for manu facturing this product remained closed down, but the balance of the refining facilities continued operating at capacity. (g) Refinery . Ho major operating facilities were completed during 1946. There were, however, alterations and additions made to several existing plants. (h) sitra and sitra Terminal . The construction of the causeway and the new wharf started in 1945 were completed during the year. Many other facilities, such as a magneto telephone system, a new pump shelter, etc., were provided in the Sitra Terminal. Work was also commenced on an extending tank field lighting system. (i) Drum plant . No major alterations were made to the Drum plant but minor additions were carried out to increase drum manufacture and filling operations. (j) Camp facilities . Increased numbers of personnel have necessitated increased housing in Awali. The 20 two-bedroom houses /started......./ started in 1945 have been completed and 13 additional 2-bedroom houses are in the course of construction. The increased number of families also necessitated a 2-room extension to the Awali school. The 52 room bunkhouse no longer required for living quarters is being converted into a native hospital. (k) Personnel. The following gives a summary of the personnel employed by the Company on their regular operations and on additional construction .work during the year:- « Americans 120 (Including.18 Con tractors’ employees) British (U.K.; ... 348 Canadians ... 60 South Africans ... 24 Other Europeans 11 British Indians 554 Iraqis ... 8 Bahreinis 3,170 Others 641 Total 4,936 gg. PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED. . (i) This year the company were able to resume geological exploration and drilling in their various concessionary areas in the Persian Gulf. A geophysical survey party visited the Prucial Coast in the spring and again in the autumn of 1946. Arrangements had been made for a seismic survey party to visit Qatar in the autumn but the U.S.A. seamen^ strikes delayed the party, and they are now expected to begin work early in 1947. (ii) QATAR . In April, 1946, Dukhan Camp was re-opened and pre parations made for a drilling programme to be started in the autumn. This plan was abandoned in October and it was decided instead to speed up production, and w¥#k January, 1949, was fixed as a provisional date for the first export. Preliminary general surveys were carried out in November along the projected route of a pipe-line and pipe line road and locations for a terminal oil dock site, a permanent camp, and unloading points for heavy equipment were examined. It has been proposed to build a* road from a new harbour near Al Hamlah on the west coast of Qatar across the peninsula to a jetty at Wakrah, with forks to Doha and a terminal oil dock in the vicinity of El Arrif. More will be known of the practicability of‘these proposals wnen H.M.S. 'Challenger” has completed her survey of Qatar territorial waters which she began in November of this year. (iii) TRUCIAL COAST. In the first part of the year surface geology was carried out in the following area_. /jabalJabal Faiyah Kalba Jabal Hafit Baraimi Oasis Part of the Oman Range to the east of Baraimi and Hafit. In the autumn an extensive programme including magnetometer, gravimeter, and topographical surveys was started in the undermentioned areas: Ras al Khaimah Umm al Qaiwain Ajman Sharjah Dubai Abu Dhabi. Close contact was maintained throughout these operations with the Residency Agent who was of great assistance. 23. CABLE &amp; VvIRELSSS LIMITED . (i) TRAFFIC . All classes of traffic increased and comparative figures of paid messages for 1945 and 1946 show an increase of approximately 14S. A feature has been the steady increase in traffic in Arabic characters between the various Gulf States and Saudi Arabia. 1945. 1946. Despatched from Bahrain 31,272 36,535 Received for Bahrain 23,494 29,299 in transit 51,555* 55,461* *(Thene figures do not include traffic in transit for 'Iraq and Persia). » ' Aircraft services were maintained on a 24 hour a day basis throughout the year, and the marine short wave service which had been suspended during the war was re introduced. The marine medium wave service was curtailed from 24 to 16 hours a day after Admiralty control had ceased on January 1st, 1946. (ii) CABLES . The Bahrain-Fao, Bahrain-Bushire and Bahrain-Muscat cables were interrupted for long periods during the year, but all were in working order on the 31st December, 1946. The wireless services to Kuwait, Hassa, and Sharjah were maintained throughout the year, and a radio-telephony circuit opened with the petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, Camp at Dukhan in Qatar. There was a total disruption of communications with Bushire from the 19th September to the 11th November during the tribal disturbances. (iii) TECHNICAL .

Three additional /modern receivers-18- modern receivers and a modern cathode-ray equipment for servicing all Persian Gulf wireless equipment has also been installed during the year, (i v ) STAFF .

During the year the Corporation completed its return to a peace time footing. The special R.A.F. services were abolished and some of the B.O.A.C. services discontinued. The trunK route service from the united Kingdom to the Far :;ast was extended to include Singapore and was operated by bunderlands. The weekly l.ocKheed Lodestar service between Bahrain and Cairo which was proposed at the end of last year was not introduced. Karly in January the ’Ensign' class aircraft were with drawn from the Cairo-Earachi schedule and their place taken by 'C* Class flyingboats. Towards the end of the year notice was received that the 'C' Class flyingboats were also to be withdrawn and replaced by the newrudor land aircraft. Unfortunateiy the tonnage of the rudor •planes makes it impossible for them to use the r/uharraq aerodrome and this will deprive Bahrain of both the Durban-Calcutta and the Cuiro-Karachi schedules and break the air 1in* with the Crucial Coast. A short table of statistics for 1946 is given below. Eewer passengers embarked and disembarKed at Bahrain than in 1945 but there was an increase in the amount of freight and mail carried. With the discontinua tion of U.S.A. Post Office facilities the mail of British and American employees of the Bahrain Petroleum company was again despa tolled by B.O.A.C. aircraft. (i) Statistics.

Shaikh Hamad, a son and the heir presumptive of Shaikh Abdullah, while suffering mildly from diabetes con tinued in good health during the year. In'October he was reported to have disposed of a consignment of 20 rifles to a Persian dhow which called at Dohah, but he and his father vigorously denied the charge.

The ownership of the ruined site of Zubara continued to embitter the relations between Bahrain and ^atar. At the time of the political Agent’s visit in June, he received an assurance from the shaiKh and Hamad bin Abdullah that members of the Al Khalifah family would always be welcome in Qatar, provided they gave notice of their arrival, and that Bahrainis visiting Zubara would be treated in exactly the same manner as Qatar subjects who visited Bahrain.

The party also worked in Abu Dhabi territory. Triangula tion survey work was completed in Has al Khaimah, Umm al Qaiwain and Ajman. Considering the frequent threats and obstructions by individual tribesmen, the strikes of drivers and guards and more particularly the difficult terrains on which the party had had to work the speed with which they had progressed in their exploration work was remarkable. (iv) Imperial Bank of Persia . 1946 saw the opening of a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Dubai. Mr. F.H. Johnson, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Shiraz (Persia), arrived at Sharjah on the 3rd January and obtained a concession for the opening of a brunch from the Shaikh of Dubai.

He returned to Bahrain HJdtk on the 15th after calling on the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dubai, Ras al Khaimah, Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain. (ix) Medical . No epidemic of any kind was reported during the year. Malaria was endemic and was the cause of much of the general ill-health of the population. The most prevalent diseases were dysentery, venereal and eye diseases and sloughing ulcers. Muhammad Yasin, in charge dispensary, Trucial Coast, Dubai, proceeded on leave to India on the 19th of June, and returned on the 11th of August. ( x ) Royal Air Force . On the night of March 6th an R.A.F. askari guarding the cable line outside the R.A,F. camp at Sharjah fired at a jeep carrying R.A.F. Military police and Levies on patrol duty. The one shot fired grazed the arm of one British Military Policeman, and entered the forearm of another, but fortunately without wounding him seriously. /On the 18thOn the 18th March an R.A.F. Wellington flew over the s.s. '• Afghanis tan” anchored off the island of Abu Musa to drop a message on board. Unfortunately in doing so the pilot misjudged his height and struck the top of one of the ship^ masts, carrying it away, and damaging the tail and rudder of his aircraft. After jettisoning its petrol the ’plane made a belly landing on the island. rhe crew were uninjured and were taken to Sharjah the same day by launch. The engines were undamaged but the ’plane was 'written off' and offered, with the dismantled engines, to the Shaikh of Sharjah. ( xi ) U.S.A.T.C . About 60 tons of wireless masts and other wireless equipment from the U.S.A.T.C. establishment at Sharjah were sold to the Arabian American Oil Company by the U.S. Army•authorities and shipped to Dhahran by oil barge. (xii) Local Affairs . (a) In April of this year the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah built a fort at Wadi al Qaur to prevent highway robbers from invading the Batinah Coast through the Wadi al Qaur. The Muscat Government met the cost of building the fort and are also paying for the maintenance of the garrison consisting of eight men. (b) After the Khor Ghanadhah incident relations between the shaikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi became strained. V/hen all the efforts of the political Agent to induce the Shaikh of Dubai to return some 150 camels, which he had looted, to Abu Dhabi failed sanctions were imposed on him by stopping all travel facilities to Dubai subjects and by diverting one steamer to Sharjah. in the meanwhile the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had raised a force of 2,000 men under the command of his brother Shaikh Hazza bin Sultan for invading Dubai. The political Agent who was then at Sharjah prevented a clash by obtaining the agreement of Dubai to pay compensation to Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh of Dubai also agreed to return all the Abu Dhabi looted camels. Although these demands were complied with, negotiations for the restoration of friendly relations between Shaikh Hazza and the Shaikh of Dubai broke down, and the efforts of the various Trucial Shaikhs to mediate in the dispute were all in vain. Both sides indulged in numerous camel looting incidents the shaikh of Dubai takintr the initiative in most cases. By the end of the year the situation had quietened down. (c) Another significant event on the Trucial Coast during the year was the dispute between the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and his brother and his nephews. In August the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah garrisoned his fort and strategic points in and around Ras al Khaimah stopping /all traffic(! &lt;n' v ' -28- all traffic to and from the town. He also prevented his brother Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim and his nephews who were staying in the gardens on the outskirts from entering the town. His reason for taking these pre cautions was the alleged plotting by his nephews to kill him and seize power. All persuasion failed to shake the Shaikh from his firm resolve to refuse his brother and nephews entry into the town. He, however, was prepared to give them the usual allowances. Shaikh Mohammed sought the intervention of His Majesty’s • Government in the dispute, but both sides were informed that they should settle the matter themselves. By the end of the year no progress had been made. (d) Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Na’im at Buraimi, blinded and then executed three persons suspected of having organised a plot to assassinate him and instal his cousin Humaid bin Hamdan in his place. The Shaikh is a wealthy man and very unpopular among his people. H.B.M.*s political Agent, Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.
