No. 1. Earl Granville to the Sultan of Zanzibar.* Sire, Foreign Office, November 9, 1872. THIS letter will be delivered to your Highness by Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere, Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, and a member of the Council for India, who has been deputed by Her Majesty the Queen to proceed on a Highness to join with them in framing measures which shall have for their object the complete suppression of this cruel and destructive traffic. Your Highness cannot but be aware of the deep interest taken by the Queen and people of this country in the suppression of the Slave Trade, nor of the sacrifices which have been made, both of valuable life and of treasure to attain this desired end. Not more than twenty years ago the traffic in slaves was carried on by powerful nations from the West Coast of Africa to a far greater extent than it now obtains on the East Coast, w'hen as many as from 60,000 to 70,000 slaves were exported to countries on the other side of the Atlantic in a single year. Her Majesty’s Government and people of this country were determined that this traffic should cease. They therefore maintained a powerful squadron on the coast engaged entirely in the suppression of the Traffic, and by remonstrating with the Governments of those countries whose subjects were engaged in the Traffic, and by making Treaties with the Governments in question binding them to use their best exertions to put a stop to the Slave Trade, and to punish severely their subjects who might engage in it, the end which Her Majesty’s Government had in view was attained, and they can now point to the West Coast of Africa and say that where a few years since slaves were carried away in tens of thousands, now not a single slave is exported, and in the place of this inhuman traffic which was carried on only by means of wars undertaken in the interior with the sole object of procuring, slaves, a flourishing legal trade has everywhere arisen which the native chiefs and, all who were formerly engaged in shipping slaves now acknowledge is far more profitable than man-stealing and man-selling. What Her Majesty’s Government under most adverse circumstances have succeeded in accomplishing on the West Coast of Africa, it is equally their object to effect on the East Coast, and on the part of Her Majesty’s Government I have therefore to invite your Highness frankly and cordially to join them in framing measures which shall effectually put a stop to the illegal export of slaves from any part of your dominions. Should your Highness, as Her Majesty’s Government confidently trust you will, join with them frankly and cordially in carrying out efficient measures for putting an end to the export of slaves from your dominions in Africa, your Highness may reckon on the friendship and support of this country and of the Government of India; but should on the other hand your Highness decline the terms which will be submitted to you by Her Majesty’s Envoy, your Highness may be assured that, however much Her Majesty’s Government may regret your decision, the objects which they have in view will none the less be pursued. Special Mission to your Highness, to make known to you the views of Her Majesty and of Her Government on the question of the East African Slave Trade, and to invite your I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GRANVILLE. * A similar letter was addressed to the Sultan of Muscat. [140] BEarl Granville to Sir Bartle Frere. (iNo Sir. 1 . ■ . Foreign Office, November 9, 1872. PHE experience ol the last few years having conclusively proved that the existino- Treaty engagements between Her Majesty and the Sultan of Zanzibar for the suppression of the export trade in slaves from His Highness’ Dominions on the east coast of Africa, do not suffice for the attainment of the object for which those engagements were framed' and Her Majesty’s Government having determined to spare no effort to put a stop to this traffic, I have to acquaint you that Her Majesty the Queen, having entire confidence in your zeal and ability, has determined to avail herself of your great experience in Eastern affairs, and to accredit you as her Special Envoy to the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, and to confer upon you full powers under the Great Seal as herewith inclosed to enter into negotiations, and to conclude Treaties with those Chiefs and with any others with whom it may be desirable to contract engagements for the suppression of the East African Slave Trade. I have accordingly to request that you will hold yourself in readiness to proceed to Zanzibar and Muscat in a vessel of the Royal Navy, which, at the instance of the Lords of the Admiralty will be directed to convey you and your suite to the places which, in pursuance of tlm objects of your Mission, it may be necessary that you should visit. On your arrival at Zanzibar and Muscat, having obtained an interview with the Rulers ot those States, you will deliver the letters from Her Majesty accrediting you. which I inclose. In the case of the Sultan of Zanzibar you will impress upon His Highness the extreme disappointment of Her Majesty’s Government at the want of efficient execution °f the provisions of his existing Treaty engagements. You will explain to His Highness that this evasion of his Treaty obligations can no no longer be tolerated by Her Majesty’s Government, and they call upon him to co-operate with them in framing arrangements which shall effectually put a stop to the exportation of slaves from his Dominions on the East Coast of Africa. As regards the Sultan of Muscat you will explain to His Highness that he is bound by the Treaty engagements contracted by his predecessors to prevent the importation of slaves from the African Coast into his territories; and you will give His Highness distinctly to understand in firm, but conciliatory language, that Her Majesty’s Govern ment have determined to suppress the East African traffic in slaves, and that they must hold him responsible for a punctual fulfilment of his Treaty obligations. Should you find the Ruler of either State willing to promise co-operation in this work of suppression, you are empowered to obtain such modification of existing Treaties and engagements as you may, after careful deliberation and consultation with the British Agents on the spot, find necessary. Your object should be to enable our Consular and Naval officers to give full effect ^ ^ ns ^ rilc ^ ons °f Her Majesty’s Government for the ultimate effectual suppression of the Slave Trade along the whole of the East African, Arabian, and Persian coasts, and of the public sale of imported slaves within the Dominions of Zanzibar and Muscat. n 16 even ^ your finding that it will facilitate your negotiations with the Sultan or Zanzibar to relieve His Highness from the obligation to pay to Muscat the subsidy of 40,000 crowns,_ under the Award approved by Lord Canning in April 1861, you are authorized to give to the Sultan such assurances as may satisfy him that the payment of tie subsidy will not be enforced against him, provided he consents to enter into the engagements which you will propose to him for the more effectual suppression of the East African Slave Traffic ; and, so long as he faithfully and, to the best of his power, performs all his Treaty obligations and other engagements with Her Majesty’s Govern- merit, it being emphatically impressed upon the Sultan that, in the event of the slightest mtraction of any of the engagements or stipulations into which he may enter with the . rj . lb . 1 Government, all obligations on our part to continue the payment of the amount nil absolutely cease, and the conditions which were enjoined by the Award of 1861 will be reverted to and strictly enforced. ^. ie ( f^ 1 1 er y° u are empowered, on similar conditions, to give similar assur ances o re Rulei of Muscat that the amount to which he may be entitled under the a oiesai An aid vvill be regularly paid to him from Her Majesty’s Treasury, Bombay. , n avm 8 cariiea out these instructions, and fully informed the Government of Bombay, an ovemment o. India of all that you have done, you will at once return to England and report to Her Majesty’s Government the performance of your Mission.ou will be at liberty to select an efficient staff to accompany you and to o'ive you such assistance as you may require. ^ J The Government of India will also be requested to place at your disposal any officer of Her Majesty’s Indian Service whom you may find likely to be useful as an interpreter, or in any other capacity in which his Excellency the Viceroy may consider that he would be serviceable. All your expenses in the performance of this duty will be paid bv Her Majesty’s Government. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) GRANVILLE. No. 3. Earl Granville to Sir Bartle Erere. (No. 2.) Sir, Foreign Office. November 9, 1872. WITH reference to my despatch No. 1 of this day’s date, containing instructions for your guidance on your contemplated Mission to the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, I now inclose the draft of a Treaty which you will propose to the two Sultans, having for its object the more effectual suppression of the traffic in slaves on the East Coast of Africa. I also inclose letters which I have addressed to the Sultans, and which you will deliver to their Highnesses, together with a correct translation in Arabic, accompanied by suitable expressions on the part of Her Majesty’s Government. As regards the Treaty, I have had it prepared, not with the view of binding you to the exact terms contained in the draft, but as giving you an idea of the objects which it proposed should be obtained, and of the points in regard to which the Sultans should be invited to contract engagements. It is obvious that, in addition to the Treaty engagements to be submitted to the Rulers of Zanzibar and Muscat, there are other subsidiary measures which will occupy your attention, and which doubtless would assist materially in the suppression of the East African Slave Traffic. We already have Treaty engagements with nearly every Arab Chief of importance in the Persian Gulf and on the coasts of Arabia, binding them to use their best endeavours to prevent the traffic in slaves by the people owning their sway; but it is to be feared that these Treaties have been allowed to become dead letters, and that in some instances at least they are ignored by the Chiefs and their people. I cannot doubt that, if all these Chiefs were specially reminded of their Treaty engagements, and warned that, for the future, they with their people would be held responsible amd severely punished for infractions of these engagements, such a warning would be attended with satisfactory results. At any rate, they would not be enabled to allege ignorance in extenuation of their conduct, should they be in future found violating their engagements. Printed notices in Arabic, warning the people of the consequences they will bring upon themselves by engaging in Slave Traffic, might also with advantage be distributed amongst the Chiefs and people on the coasts of Arabia and the Persian Gulf: 'and it is probable that means might also be found of making the purport of similar notices known in the interior of Africa, on the routes by which slaves are usually brought to the coast, which might have the effect of deterring the slave-dealers from bringing the slaves to the coast, when they know that the markets are closed against them. One of the points to which I would wish to draw your special attention is the question as to the custody and ultimate disposal of captured slaves, and the probable expense of any arrangements that may be necessary for this purpose. I should be glad to receive a Report from you on this subject. Another very important matter is the question as to the strength of the naval force and the arrangements that may be necessary for giving effect to the stipulations of the Treaties which you may be enabled to conclude with the Rulers of Zanzibar and Muscat. The question of the employment of Consular or Secret Agents on the African Coast, and whether they should be Europeans or natives, is one which you will doubtless also consider and report upon. I will only, in conclusion, add that, knowing the great interest you take in the suppression of the East African Slave Trade, Her Majesty’s Government have entire eontidence that you will carry out your present mission with the same zeal and ability4 which have so eminently characterized your long and- distinguished services in India, and Her Majesty’s Government on their part will be prepared to receive with the con sideration they deserve, recommendations and suggestions which you may feel it your duty to make to them. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) GRANVILLE. Inclosure in No. 3'. Draft of Treaty. # HER Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Highness Syed Bargash hen Said, Sultan of Zanzibar, being desirous to give more complete effect to the engagements entered into by the Sultan and his predecessors for the perpetual abolition of the Slave Trade, they have appointed as their Plenipo tentiaries for this purpose, that is to say :— Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere, Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, a Member of the Council for India ; And His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, Who after having communicated to each other their respective full Powers, found; in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles :— ARTICLE I. The Provisions of the existing Treaties and engagements having proved ineffectual' for preventing the export of slaves from the Territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar in Africa, Her Majesty the Queen and His Highness, agree that from and after a date to be hereafter fixed, the export of slaves from the coast of the mainland of Africa, whether destined for transport from one part of the Sultan's dominions to another, or for con veyance to foreign parts, shall entirely cease, and an} r vessel engaged in the transport or conveyance of slaves after such date, shall be liable to seizure and cendemnation by such persons and in such manner as the Sultan within his jurisdiction may authorize for the purpose, and also by all such Naval and other officers or agents, and such Courts as may be authorized for the same purpose on the part of Her Britannic Majesty. ARTICLE II. The Sultan engages that all public markets in his dominions for imported slaves shall be entirely closed. ARTICLE III. The Sultan engages to protect, to the utmost of his power, all liberated slaves, and to punish severely any attempt to molest them, or reduce them again to slavery. ARTICLE IV. Her Britannic Majesty engages that natives of Indian States under British protection shall, from and after a date to be hereafter fixed, be prohibited from possessing slaves, and in the meanwhile from acquiring any fresh slaves. ARTICLE V. The present Treaty shall be ratified, and the ratification shall be exchanged at Zanzibar as soon as possible, but in any case within the space of months from the date hereof. In witness whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the same, and have affixed thereto their respective seals.

IT is desirable, for the furtherance of the objects of the Mission to the East Coasts of Africa and Arabia with 'which you have been charged, that you should proceed to Paris and Pome, and confer on the subject with Her Majesty’s Pepresentatives at those capitals, to whom instructions have been sent to afford you all the assistance in their power. I have accordingly to request that you will take the route via Pome and Paris to Brindisi, where Her Majesty’s ship “ Enchantress,” which is the vessel chosen by the Lords of the Admiralty to convey you and your suite on your Mission, has been ordered to await your arrival. The “ Enchantress ” will leave Portsmouth on the 12th instant, and may be expected at Brindisi on or about the 30th. I have to request that you will report to me the dates of your departure from England and of your embarkation on board the “Enchantress,” and that all your correspondence on the subject of your Mission may be addressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) GEANVILLE. No. 5. Earl Granville to Sir Bartle Frere. (No. G.) Sir, Foreign Office, November 19, 1872. THE letters of credence to the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, which are inclosed in my despatch No. 1 of the 9th instant are, in point of form and mode of preparation, similar to those which have been sent on former occasions, and to the letters which are occasionally written by the Queen to the Shah of Persia, the Emperors of China and Japan, the King of Siam, and other great Eastern Potentates. I do not think it advisable that any alteration in this respect should be made on the present occasion, not only because it would be a needless departure from the previous practice, but also because, if any alteration were now made, and not continued on a future occasion, the change would probably be looked upon as a designed affront. The great increase of intercourse between Europe and the Asiatic States in recent years has made the Eastern authorities much more familiar than they formerly were wdth European usage imregard to the mode of correspondence and the form of letters; and the British Government has, for many years, been gradually discontinuing the ancient practice of writing to Eastern Princes on ornamental vellums, or in any other peculiar mode as to material or form, and now follow in these respects the same practice as with regard to European or American States. I am. &amp;c. (Signed) GPANYILLE. No. 6. Earl Granville to Sir B. Frere. (No. 7.) Sir, - Foreign Office, November 20, 1872. I HAVE to inform you that, after communication with the Lords of the Treasury, the following scale of remuneration has been decided on for yourself and the members of the staff whom you have selected to accompany you on your Mission to the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, viz:— To yourself, as Special Envoy, a salary at the rate of 5,000/. per annum. To the Pev. G. P. Badger, as Secretary and Confidential Adviser to yourself, a salary at the rate of 1,500/. per annum. To Major C. B. Ewan Smith, as Military Attache to the Mission, a salary at the rate of 600/. per annum. To Captain Fairfax, R.N., as Naval Attache to the Mission, a special rate of pay of [140] Cr— r—rj. — ^ 600/. per annum has been granted, and the difference between his half and full pay as a naval officer will also be charged to the Special Mission Account. To Mr. Hill, as Secretary, and to Mr. Grey as Attache to the Mission, a sum of 100/. has been assigned to cover their actual expenditure in preparing for the expedition, and the question of the remuneration to be awarded to these gentlemen for their services is to stand over until the return of the Mission. All the above-mentioned salaries are to date from the day of your departure from this country. I am, &amp;c.
