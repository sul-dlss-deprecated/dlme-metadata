G. Laithwaite Ssquire, I'he mdia Office LondonAIR MINISTRY. May I refer to our recent conversation on the subject of Das Island, on which you stated that, in your opinion, political considerations made it desirable for us to stake some sort of claim. as I told you, our A.O.C. in Iraq has stated that this Island is of no value from an R.A.F. point of view. The view held here is therefore that if any claim is to be staked, the right person to originate such action is the Resident, Persian Gulf, and not the A.O.C. If you consider the matter worth pressing further,^will you please communicate with the Resident, Persian Gulf. If he agrees with your view, then we of* course would co-operate in any way possible.

C&gt; ^ ®igAN1934 COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL 0 f iH'h'f 4 My dear Kerdy, You will rememder tnat when Air “ Commodore Welch kinaly came here the other day to talk adout the Arad air route, the possibility of using the island of Das as an emergency landing ground or the like was mentioned. I write now only to put on record that the point was touched on and to aiggest that you might possibly think it worth while mentioning to the A.O.C. Iraq, who could, if he saw any advantage in pursuing the pufal, discuss itfwitn tiie political Resident. There might conceivably he some advantage on political grounds in having staked out a claim on Das, whichappears from the Persian Gulf Pilot to he waterless ana generally valueless, hut which covers a series of Arab islands which lie to the south. There is probably extremely little likelihooa of the Persians ever prefering a claim to ary of these islands. But if they aid. the fact that we established^ on Das would probably make it easier to dispose of any unsubstantial claims they might put forward to other islands such as Zirko, Shura Awa, etc. From the air point of view Das is much I —— 'more in the line along which Imperial Airways fly than B eni Yas, and there 2262 5000 1 1.33— might he some advantage in reducing the risk of visits either by Airways or by foreign commercial aircraft, if and when they are permitted to fly the civil route, to landing grounds such as Beni Yas, which are on our strategic line. * tI 1</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000209_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1983</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000209</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1983</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/32 ‘Air-route to India (Arab Coast): Possibility of establishing a landing ground on Das Island’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T00:54:57</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 7; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence between John Gilbert Laithwaite of the India Office, Harold Spencer Kerby of the Air Ministry, and Trenchard Craven William Fowle as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
