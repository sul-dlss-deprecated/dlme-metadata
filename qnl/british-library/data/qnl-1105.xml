Kemball attaches to his letter correspondence from his predecessor, Lt-Col Samuel Hennel (not included in the volume), and recommends that the opinions also be sought of Major Atkins Hamerton, Her Majesty's Consul and the Honourable Company's Agent in the dominions of His Highness the Imam of Muscat, and Captain Haines, the Political Agent at Aden.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000064#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
