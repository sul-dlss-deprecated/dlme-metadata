Sir, I have the honour to refer to our conversation on the 8th itebruary 1936 and to enclose a copy of a memorandum Ko*S#0*16 dated the 5th Febma-ry 1936 from the Senior Officer in the Persian Gulf regarding navigation in the Khor ^alai'yah. 2. We agreed that it would be possible to issue a notice infoming the public, especially fishe-r folk, that la-r^e ships like a man-of-war cannot when ente-ring or leaving Khor ^alai'yah avoid small boats and sailing craft as there is no space in the deep water to enable them to do so and that such craft must, therefore, get out of the way of lar^e ships. It would also be sound to inform the public that if the la-r^e ship sounds four short blasts on the syren or whistle, it means that the small craft is in the way of the ship so sou&amp;aing he^ syren or whistle. 3.

A notice to this effect in English and Arabic was displayed, signed by Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser, Bahrain Government.A copy of the letter was sent to: Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai; Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah; Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of Ajman; Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayed, Ruler of Abu Dhabi; Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, Ruler of Um al Qaiwain; Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah; Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar; Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan Amad, in charge of current duties of the Residency Agent, Sharjah.
