The pavement is a delicate blue, most of which has flaked off. \r\nCondition: The painting has been set into a shallow frame and filled out with plaster painted a deep pink. There are many cracks and small gaps, though the surface is in good condition. \r\nTechnique: The gesso is laid on a base of mud and straw (or rushes).", "medium": "Limestone, gesso, pigment", "dimensions": "10 1/16 x 11 1/2 x 1/8 in.
