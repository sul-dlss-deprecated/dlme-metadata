The various points mentioned in Sir Bernard Reilly's note, a copy of which was received with his demi-official letter of the 5th May last, have been examined by the Government of India and the whole position will be discussed with Sir Bernard when he visits Delhi in January 1937. In the meantime, I am desired to communicate the views of the Government of India on the points which concern them, viz - Nos.1-5, 10, 12-14, 16, 19 and 22-25. X X X X (iii) Point 5. Currency . The Government of India are prepared to supply the necessary currency from India in direct communication with the Aden Government.78132/36. Dear Clauson, There is a point in connection with the future of Aden which was not touched upon during the meeting on the 19th June, namely the currency question. I think that we are all agreed that Aden should continue to use Indian currency, at any rate for some time to come. Existing currency laws, applicable to Aden, will he maintained in operation, and I do not imagine that any formal arrangement with the Government of India is required; hut you will no douht consider whether any communication to the Government is required. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale. Yours sincerely, 2 6JUN1936 iN D.A OFFICE M.J. CLAUSON, ESQ.Minute Paper. p. z. 3612/36 POLiTicALDepartment.

As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that 'were then discussed, ard adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Reilly. J. C .

I should he grateful for your observations, but presumably no serious difficulty need be anticipated. (I note in this connection that Indian currency continued to circulate in Iraq up to quite recently and that so far as India was concerned we should have been glad had this state of things continued).

FILE COPY , Sunmerset, Tel: Lvm net o n 252 . \\ t Lymington, r/X, i* ' HANTS. vv yj IJo3 10th August, 1933, Dear Laitb^aite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some oi the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 5. Currency . In view of the close business connection between Aden and India it will be convenient if Aden continues to use Indian currency, and an agreement for the supply of currency can, I suppose, be made with the Government of India.(The references in 'the-note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly 1 s demi-official letcer of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly’s d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton end Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. 5. currency: * It was agreed that, at any rate for the time being, much the best arrangement would be that, if no objection was seen by the Government of India, Aden should continue to use Indian currency, arrangements for the supply of tne necessary currency being made with the Government of India. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in Mauritius for a very long period Indian currency had remained current, and that precedents were not lacking for action on the lines suggested.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000005_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1469</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000005</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1469</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/33 'Changes in civil administration in the event of separation from India: currency'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-26T10:23:08</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 12; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence between the Aden Chief Commissioner (Bernard Reilly), the India Office Political Department, and the Government of India, regarding arrangements for Aden to continue using the Indian currency following transfer to the Colonial Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Currencies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000005#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
