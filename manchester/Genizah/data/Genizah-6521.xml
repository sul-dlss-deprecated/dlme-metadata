If the number 50 there stands for the year, than it's probably 1250 (= 1834), 7 years after the recto was written. At first it seems as if this small piece of paper was cut off of a larger sheet (which contained the text of the recto), to be used for this small documentary note regarding a certain sum of money - 261 and 54 (to be paid to Nissim the Jew who is mentioned in the recto?); however, it seems that the left margins of this document are also cut, which is further reinforced by Ar. 69-1, 69-2 as the complementing part of this fragment. Muhammad Abu Aliya (?) al-wakil (? = legal representative) is mentioned. The last line states that the written amount is paid and &lt;the part of the Jew had been paid&gt;. (The words in &lt;&gt; completed from the complementary ms. Ar. 69-2).</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:type>Manuscripts</dc:type><dc:title>Arabic document</dc:title></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
