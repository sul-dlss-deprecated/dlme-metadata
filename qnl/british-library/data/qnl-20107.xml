(N. ^ U.D, )Karachi, 17th Kovember 1931 # My dear Friend, During the two interviews which I have had with Your Highness regarding your proposed abdication, I have explained to Your Higness the very serious effect on the financial position of the Muscat State that this step wil^have. Your Highness has finally asked me to communicate the decision of the Government of India to you in writing in order that you may give me a written reply. I therefore write to inform Tour Highness that in the event of your persisting in your intention to abdicate - (i) the Government of India will find themselves constrained to advise the Muscat State Council that Your Highness 1 allowrance in India should be reduced to Rs. 2000/- per mensem; and (ii) that the Arms Traffic subsidy of Rs. 1,00,000/- paid every year to the Muscat State will cease. 7 As Your highness is aware almost every country in the world if going through at the present time a period of financial difficulty and economic distress, and the Muscat State is no exception. With great difficulty, and owing to the most drastic measures of retrenchment the State has succeeded in balancing its budget, but the coming 3is Highness air Saiyid Maxx Taimur bin Paisal bin Turki k p t tp p q t Sultan of Muscat and Oman, ' C.S.I. , it Karachi.coming year ib likely to be eTen more difficult than the last. It is hardly necessary to point out the disastrous effect of the loss of Rupees one lakh on the finances of the State which Your Highness' abdication will impose. Surely it is not much to ask that to avert this Your Highness should agree to spend the short period of three months at Muscat, at a time of year when the climte is exceedingly pleasant and healthy. I hope therefore that eren now Your Highness will reconsider the decision that you have given me verbally. X remain Your Highness' sincere friend. (SGD) H. V.

From To The Hon'ble Lt.Colonel H .V.Biscoe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, xhe Hopeigj secretary to the GoYernment of India 9 Hew Delhi. Sir, * I have the honour to invite a reference to the ^ eor res pond ence ending with your letter Ho.?. 40^/31, dated the qx . 86th Beptemher 1931, regarding the desire of Mis Hi^iness the Ruitan of Muscat to abdicate, and to report that, in accordance with the instructione of the Ooveriunent of India, I proceeded to Karachi by air on the 13th Moranber. arriving there the following day. I had pre-rioualy arranged with His Higfanesa to aeet me there and I was also anxious that Saiyid said should accompany me, as he has in the past been Tery helpful in discussions with his father, and 1 was also anxious to talk over various matters regarding the administration of the state with him. Unfortunately the mail steamer Imd already left Muscat when my telegram inviting saiyid Said to join me at Karachi reached him. but the senior Naval officer very kindly arranged for him to go over to Owadur in H .m. S .-S-owey'. and from there he flew into Karachi with me. 2. on the 15th I had a prolonged interview with Said laimur lasting about three hours, and it was continued the follov/ingaS) following day for neariy a» long. I regret to inform tiie GoTemraent of India that all my efforts to induce His HigJmeBs to return to Ifaecat and to reconsider his decision were un availing „ and that he absolutely refused to do so. I began by conveying to him the instructions received in letter lao. P # 40«»ll/31 f dated the 2bth September 1931 from the Government of India to the effect that they would be compelled to advise the Council to reduce his allowance to Hs*2000 y and to dis continue the Arms Subsidy. Neither threat seemed to mala the smallest impression on aaid Talraur, He stated that his present expenses were small ana that he lived in a modest way # and did not desire to be a burden on the finances of the State, and that the sum proposed would in the circumstances be adequate 9 and as regards the subsidy he stated that the Oovernment of India had given it am were at liberty to dis continue it, if It seemed to them good, and that it was for them to advise the state how to manage their finances. In fact he virtually washed his hands of all further responsibi lity for his State, and said that Government could do whatever they liked regarding it. He admitted that he had written to Saiyid Said last April infoxming him that he Intended to return to Muscat and had authorised him to inform the Political Agent but said that he had merely written this in order to encourage and console Saiyid Said &amp; 3» His Highness however made very little attempt to argue or even discuBs the matter. Kveiy argument and appeal and even threat that I addressed to him was met with a mono tonous refrain - •I am sick and cannot return: I am sick and cannot return**, varied occasionally by the addition M I have only a few years to live and wish to end my days in peace'.I pointed out to Mis HlghneBs the very serious effect the die- i continuance of the subsidy would have upon the financial position of his State i coming as it did at a time of world-vide depression and economic distress. I emphasised that no man has a right to divest himself of responsibilities whicMhave been placed upon him, and to abandon his State and his family to the charity of others, and that such ccnduct would sully his name* ^o every kind of appeal he was absolutely impervious, and I am convinced that nothing short of personal violence would have induced him to go on board the steamer and sail for Muscat* finally, at the end of these two prolonged interviews His Hi^iness got up and asked me to write him a short letter to which he coild give a final reply in writing# I therefore addressed him a short letter communicating the message that I have received from the Government of India regarding his allowance and the subsidy, and ending with a short appeal to him to reconsider Ms decision. I now forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of His Hi^lnes8 , rep^y, from which it will be seen that ne accepts the reduction of his allowance t admits the ri^it of Government to withdraw the subsidy, if they see fit to do so, and finally abdicates from the Throne, appointing as his successor his son, Saiyid Baid bin Taimur. ^ fear there is nothing to be done but to accept His Higmess' deoision as final. axcept froa the financial point of view I do not think that Said laiaur's departure is to be regretted. He has proved himself an utterly incompetent am useless ruler, and departs unregretted, I believe, by a single soul in his State. 6# 1% now remains to consider the question of the succession.succession. The Government of India appeared to be under the impression formerly that the sultan was elected, but Major Murphy dealt isith this question in a valuable note tfilch I forwarded to them under cover of my demi-official letter ho* 701-S$ dated the 31st December 1929, and showed, 1 think, conclusively that «hile the imamate was elective the Sultan had never been elected! when the offices were combined an election took place, but the election was that of the Jmam aai not that of the sultan. Inrthermore, in the present ikoivlition of the Muscat state no election is possible. The sultan rules only along the coast 9 and such authority as exists in the interior is in the hands of the Imam, and the Shaikhs of the various tribes. They obviously cannot be asked to elect a Sultan whose authority they do not acknowledge. xhe Sultan has appointed as|hi8 successor his son, Saiyid Uaid. The latter is now 22 years old. He has for the last two years acted as .President of the Council and has acquired a practical knowledge of the administration of the State. While during the first year he took but little active part in the administration, which was largely in the bands of Mr.rhomas and the elder members of the Council g during the last 12 months he has very definitely asserted himself. Mr. Thomas has left, two of the former members of the Council have died, and the so-called Council now consists of Saiyid said and Shaikh Zubair - a very worthy but quite insignificant individual, who supervises fairly satisfactorily the judicial work of the State. Por seme time past therefore the Council has in practice been raiyid &amp;aid; invested with this responsibility and azthority he lias, I consider^ risen very well to the occasion. He has displayed keen interest in the finances of the State; he has asserted ....1h asserted hie personal authority on eeTeral oceasions. For instance at Sohar his uncle. Said Earned, had been Wall for many years past and had established a virtual autocracy there to the great detriaent of the State finances. Baiyid Said proceeded there by himself and transferred his uncle to another place. He has re-established the authority of the State at Sur as reported to the (knreanment of India in my telegram Mo. 550, dated the 29th October 1931, and it remains now only to deal with the question of Aiqa and the Bani Bu Ali, and I am glad to be able to inform the Government of India that the ^Al Baid* has succeeded in seising one of the Aiqa dhows with* out any assistance from His Majesty's Mavy • This should have a good effect* Saiyid said was for five years at the Mayo College, Ajmere, and has therefore got a very much better education than any of his predecessors, and is keen and intelligent. small in stature and rather insignificant to looic at, he appears to possess a somewhat quiclc temper - not at all a bad thing in an Oriental ruler - and tliie will, I think, make M b resp.oted by hie subjcots. He is therefore personally vrell qualified to asutuse the reins of gorenusent and - though it is always dangerous to prophesy in such matters - he should sake a good mad energetio ruler, unless the enerrating cliaate in which he is compelled to lire takes its toll upon him. 8. I therefore reoommend that the Government of India should accord hla their reoognition as emltan of Museat in the Place of his father. It will however be necessary to maintain some measure of control over the finances of the state for many years to come. rhe ruler will be young and not very experien ced, and has no competent Arab adrisers. The State still owes about ...zjo (i'i) about Hs.BO.OOO to the Government of India and has other outstanding debts amounting to about Re.It lakhs. Though eaergetiC maaex es ;u- tmbeen taken to balance the budget, the Stats cannot yet be regarded as solvent and the future is un certain, and its financial stability has always been regarded ae a natter of concern to Urn Government of India, jfurthe^ the State relies to a large extent on the support of the British Go.e.tiaant fat- the Maintenance of its authority on the coast, and the latter can therefore fairly demand that it shall maintain such feres as its resources permit of to dsal sith minor inciaents, and relisve His Majesty's ships of at any rate some of the xesponeiMllty. 9* In hi&amp; letter of abdication Bald Taitmir writes that he has a .ised his son to consult the Political Agent on important matters. I would suggest therefore that if the (iovernaent of India accept the abdication of Said I'aimur and agree to the succession of Saiyid Said I should be authorised to a.cord sayid Seid fo naal recognition as sultan of Muscat. This I would do at a public durbar which I consider should be as imposing a function as the financial position of the state will permit of, and to which if possible some of the shaikhs from the interior should b» invited. At the same time I would suggest that I should be authorised to write him another letter bringing the above passage in S4id Taimur's letter to his notice and recalling the financial assistance and anted support given to the state in the past and inform him that the Oovernment of India trust that until the finances have been put on a satisfactory footing and the debts liquidated, he will keep the Political Agent generally informed regarding the esnditton of tha finances, and that the strength of the Levy Corps will not be reduced below the present figure of 160, all ranks, and that adequate provision will be made in%1 e) the budget to laaintaln it in a state of efficiency. I would arrange beforehand verbally for Saiyid Siaid to show me his draft * reply and would see that it was suitably worded. 10. I do not think that at first Baiyid said willj/prove at all intractable* He is young for his years, and, 1 think, lonely* r rhere is practically no one in the Btate in whom he really has confidence or who is capable of assisting him* At AJmere and elsewhere he has had many dealings with British officers and I think turns inatinctiyely towards them. 11. I have not dealt in this despatch with the question of the subsidy and the finances of the State* when in ifiaiachi Saiyid Said showed me certain rough budget figures for the current and coming years* and I have asked mayor jpowle to send me a detailed report on the subject of the finances of the State. As soon as it is received I will address the Government of India separately on the subject. I am also dealing in a separate despatch with the question of a Financial Adviser. In conclusion I may mention that said Taimur informed roe ^hat he had sold all his furniture and was arranging to sell his house at rehra and proposed to reside permanently in Ceylon in fixture. I em sending a copy of this despatch by air mail to His Majesty # 8 Secretary of state for India. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, ao ijfyhv' ^ \1' 0 it.

However,the fact remains that he has now finally and formally abdicated, and the question of his successor must 'be considered. 5» Fortunately there is not much difficulty in this, Saiyid Said, the eldest son of His Highness, whom the latter, in his letter quoted above, has designated as his successor, who as President of the Council has already shown signs of ability, and who is generally recognised in the btate as the Heir Apparent, is the obvious choice, and, i recommend that he be recognised as the new aultan by His Majesty's government. 4. The sooner this is done, i venture to suggest, the better. At the same time having regard to the peculiar relations which exist between His Majesty 's (iovernment and the Muscat »State, which - though nominally independent - is in reality, to many intents and purposes, under nritish protection, I think it would be most desirable to obtain from tne new ruler some statement that, in return for recognition, he would be prepared to follow the advice of that urovernment. nis Majesty 's Government would be quite v/ithin their rights in asking for some such assurance^ it is only due to thew, support in the past, finance, political, naval and military, that the Muscat State has retained its cohesion, and has not degenerated into a series of petty coastal bhaikhdoms, such as exist on the Crucial Coast. Saiyid Said fully realises the absolute necessity of nriti sh support, and j . do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the required assurance from him, more especially as he is enjoined to do so by his father in the letter already referred to, ihere only remains the tactical que stion ..,question of the best way of obtaining it# J-t might be inexpedient perhaps for a request for this assurance to be made to «aiyid baid formally in writing# He might, however., be informed verbally that in return for recognising him His Majesty's (iovejnment expected this assurance# Thereafter, in the letter which he will presumably write asking for recognition, he would incltJde the assurance that he would be guided by the advice of that government in all important matters - expecially .Defence, j. suggest that a suitable time for these negotiations would be onthe occasion of your visit to Muscat on or about 21st jjecember. without at this stage informing Saiyid yaid as to the matter of the assurance, or committing (iovernment to his recognition, i have discussed informally with him the arrangements for his succession. He is staying on another week in Karachi as a well earned rest after his hard work during the summer, and will therefore reach mis cat on about the 1st x»eceraber» urom that date to the date of your arrival he suggests that he should continue to act as jtresident of the Council, un your arrival, after he has obtained from yon the approval i of His Majesty^ (Government to his succession he would call the leading members of the Koyal family together, with a few notables, show them the sultan's letter of abdication written to you,( as well as the letter mentioned in paragraph 8 below;,and the communication of approval from uoveinment» He is most anxious to obtain the latter, which he evidently regards as essential. ihe woyal family will then foimally place him on the throne - which apparently is the muscat custom# until your arrival Saiyid said does not propose to announce the abdication of the sultan# It is obvious that this ,.#A! -4- this aimo\ancement should be followed immediately 'by the accession of the new Kuler.

On receipt of letter according him recogni tion Sayid Said would assemble ruling family and read to them open letter which Saiyid Taimur has addressed to them and to Shaikhs and people of Muscat announcing his determination to abdicate, and nominating Saiyid Said to succeed. He would also read letter of recognition from British Government and would be placed on throne by his uncles* In reply A to letter of recognition he would send letter thanking His Majesty's Govern ment for recognition and assuming obligations similar to those undertaken by his father-vide fj ZH I enclosure 'to Knox's letter Ho.184,dated the 18th October 1915-with such verbal modifications as changed conditions required* He would also request British Government to inform other Powers with whom State is in treaty relations of his accession, as none of them now maintain Consular representatives at Muscat* 2» Followigg day Political Agent would call to offer congratulations. 3* Saiyid Said would then notify Shaikhs and inform .._g. ^ inform them that he would invite them to Muscat after Ramzan, and I would try and come down too if I can get sloop to intercept mail steamer, and suggest that I should present Kharita of congratula tion from His Excellency the Viceroy# As regards letter of recognition while I consider that the less we interfere in internal affairs of Arab principalities the better and regard our relations with Kuwait as the ideal to 'be aimed at I see no objection to asking Saiyid Sadd to accept all obligations assumed by his father* If he turns out good Ruler degree of interference would in practice presumably be slight. There would however seem to be no necessity specially to stress control of arms-traffic as was done in Saiyid Taimur t s letter. It is included in general obligations and is not live issue nowadays. -RESIDENT- Copy forwarded to the Political Agent,Muscat. \ Muscat, ?r^ 15th December 1931.

At the same time I am to enquire whether, on general grounds, or having regard to the negotiations now in progress for the amendment of the Franco-Muscat Treaty of 1844, Sir John Simon considers that there would be any advantage in giving the French Government previous information, as a matter of courtesy, of the intention of His Majesty^ Government to recognise the succession of Saiyid Said as Sultan, consequent on the abdication of Saiyid Taimur, or whether he agrees that it will be sufficient (as proposed by the Political Resident) to inform the French Government of the new ruler's accession subsequently and on a request from him that this should be done. 3. In this connection I am to refer to Foreign Office letters Nos. 49298/13, dated 31st October 1913 and 52291/13 dated 20th November 1913 and connected c orre spondenc e. iw. ox ji. jMuvemoer xyoi.# ram from —do— Ko.T.iOS, dated 15/12/31. ram from G. of I, No.3l52-S, dated 16/12/31.^3^ 6\ W liiuj ' •Ki fcj, i ^1 correspondence.

In rder, however, to avoid possible difficulties aft-r recognition has been accorded to the new Sultan, I am to suggest, for Secretary Sir S.Hcare's consideration, the desirability of adding, when approving the procedure proposed, that His Majesty's Government presume, that recognition will not be accorded oefor the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has satisfied himself that Saiyid Said is willing to write a satisfactory letter, assuming the obligations undertaken by his lather. 3. Sir John Simon presumes that the question of the renewal of the subsidies to the Sultan, and the conditions to be attached to their renewal, will be re erved 'or consideration after recognition has been accorded, ss was done on the accession of Sultan Tairnur in I'Jlo. In his opinion, however, in order to avoid possiole misunderstandirjg, a passage to this effect might usefully oe aaded to the draftdraft telegram to the Government of India, who might oiso be informed that his Majesty»s Government will await their views arid those of Colonel 3iscoe regarding any additional assurances which it may be desirable to secure. 4.

IN continuation of my telegram No. 40 of the 13th February, 1932, I have the honour to enclose herewith a ietter in Arabic, with English translation, addressed to you by His Highness. 2. His Highness's accession took place on the 10th instant without incident. There was a certain amount of discussion between his uncles when they were informed of the late Sultan's abdication, but the latter's letter to His Highness nominating him as his successor and your letter conveying the fact that the accession had the approval of His Majesty's Government disposed of any serious opposition that might have been offered. As a matter of fact, considering that His Highness had already acted virtually as Sultan in his capacity of President of the Council, that he was the eldest son of Sir Taimur-bin-Feisal, and that he was generally looked on as the heir apparent, no other member of the Royal Family had any claims to the throne. 3. The only one of His Highness's many uncles who was at all recalcitrant was the eldest of them, Sayyid Nadir, and his attitude was actuated not in any way by personal ambition but by fears for himself. On the morning of the 9th I was informed by Captain Alban, on behalf of His Highness, that all the uncles, who had been informed on the 7th instant of the approaching accession, had agreed to support it w^ith the exception of Sayyid Nadir, who still held out, and who announced his intention of interviewing the Political Agent. He, His High ness, had no objection. I had no wish, of course, to interfere in the family [408 o—11■ &gt;' ^ \' ■2 differences of the Royal Family, but as this was an important matter 1 sent a message to Sayyid Nadir saying that 1 would be pleased to see him. j 4. Sayyid Nadir talked to me for a long time, his refrain being. If fJig Highness ' did anything against him would I—as Political Agent help him? I informed him, politely but firmly, that His Highness was buJtan and that I had no intention of interfering in such obviously internal affairs as the relation between the Sultan and his uncles. I purposely kept the conversation, as far as I was concerned, on a light note, and refused to take Sayyid Nadir s appre hensions seriously. I introduced a little judicious flattery, by saying that instead of harbouring these fantastic fears he should be thinking of how he could best help His Highness with his advice and assistance, which, doubtless, would be most useful. Sayyid Nadir finally took his leave looking rather lugubrious, but apparently my advice had a beneficial effect as—having got nothing out of me— I heard afterwards that he hastened to His Highness and effusively offered him his full support. I informed the Sultan later of my conversation with his uncle. His Highness said that he was grateful for the good advice I had given Sayyid Nadir, and added, with a smile, that he imagined that the latter's apprehensions were concerned with a possible cut in his allowance. 5. On the 11th instant, as arranged with His Highness, I made my official vail on him, with Captain Mackay, to offer my congratulations on the Id and on his accession. There were present members of the Royal Family and notables. I made a short speech to which His Highness replied. 6. As far as can be judged the abdication of Sir Taimur-bin-Feisal and the accession of His Highness have caused little stir or excitement in Muscat. The late Sultan, owing to his prolonged absence from his dominions, had faded out of the picture, and his son was looked on as the inevitable heir. Moreover, the popu lation of Muscat are commercially, not politically, minded, and such matters as the export price of dates and fish, and the import price of piece-goods, together with the rise and fall of the dollar, are probably of more real interest to them, especially in these hard times, than the accession of a new Sultan. Such interest as has been displayed in the town is all in favour of His Highness. The tribes along the coast, and in the interior, will doubtless display more concern. When indications of their attitude are received I will submit a further report. I have, &amp;c. T. C. FOWLE, Lieutenant-Colonel. ip( t Enclosure 3 in No. 1.

They have approved of that and have accepted me as Ruler of the State. I would request you to inform the Higti Government that it is not hidden from me that I shall endure in my rule by the continuance of their help and assistance to me and mv Government in the same manner as my ancestors were helped by them. And it is hoped that you will assure the aforesaid Government that I have accepted all the obligations to the High Government descending to me from m&gt; father and that 1 am determined to follow his policy in all my relations with Government and that I rely on the help of the Government and declare that in accordance with the wishes of my father I will be guided by its views in important matters, as I am assured that the Government will not be pleased except in what profits my State and desires the maintenance of the independence of our Government and Sultanate. And since,3 nowaday/ s, ther6 are no othei representatives of tiiose Powers in Muscat with, whom we are m treaty relations, we would request His Majesty's Government to inform the Governments of the United States, France and Holland of our accession.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India, dated the 7th April, on the subject of the abolition of the Council of Ministers, Muscat State, and consequent changes.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Govern ment of India a copy of a letter addressed to the Political Agent by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, announcing the abolition of the Council of Ministers and the division of the work of the State into three offices. 2. In forwarding this communication the Political Agent has reported tnat Savvid Hamad-bin-Faisal, an uncle of His Highness the Sultan, has been placed in charge of internal affairs, while Sheikh Zubair-bin-Ali has been placed m charge of the administration of justice. As the Government of India are aware. Captain R. G. Alban fills the appointment of financial adviser m addition to that of Commandant of the Levies. • j tt ^ ic o 3 These arrangements are, I think, satisfactory. Sayyid Hamad is a capable and fairly well -educated man, he was formerly Vali of ^ar where he was left for a considerable period with little or no supervision on the part ot the State, and his conduct was not altogether satisfactory. His howev ^ informs me that he works satisfactorily as long as ic is SU P nf'thp ruling will be in his present post. He is probably the most capable member oftheruling family, and in Muscat it is exceedingly difficult to get anyone % req , energy or ability to hold administrative posts. Sheikh Zubalret ' going individual, who was formerly on the council for many years past. an, will I hope, supervise the administration of -fi not desire that these persons should receive the ti e himself proposes to take a very active part in the Adriiinis r . , 0 f 4 Tn this connexion I would venture to put before the Uovernmeni &lt;)i India certain considerations which, I think shoul ^ h S u ^ ® ' n f our ' dealings with the Muscat State, and which are the outcome ot numerous conversations which I have had o' different occasions with His he Sultan, We have now to deal with a very d^nt to hat ot tne ex-Sultan. Savv id Taimur, We have ourselves,given to He education and wider outlook than was possessec y J at t j ie Mayo College, has been educated partly ^fd^d and was ^ he h ^ e become Aimere. It is mevitabie, unaei inese luc f? n71 wr mld be too strong imbued with, I will not say a J^for independence that is moving so an expression, but with some of that d P zeal and most , many Oriental nations nowadays. He is young, tuu oi [435 x—1] ■ k J H' ' jnil 4 b b !j b*^ \ \^ \j4 eager to see the State flourishing and well administered. On the other hand he is sensible and does realise how dependent he is upon the support of the Govern ment of India, and he is most genuinely grateful for the help they have given him lately. When one gets to know him well he is a very attractive personality and I do not think he will be difficult to deal with provided he is not, if I m / v use an expression so much in vogue on this side of the Gulf, ' pin-pricked ' over minor matters, and is given at least that measure of autonomy which is enjoyed , by the States in India. 5. To illustrate my meaning, I would mention that in a discussion which I had with His Highness at Sur regarding the finances of the State, the question of the increase of tariff came up and His Highness asked me about the difficulties that had arisen in connexion with obtaining the consent of the American Govern ment. I mentioned that, as he was aware, the American Government in return for their consent were asking for most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of personal status for their citizens. In my express letter No. 75-S of the 12th February, 1932, I expressed the view that the State were unwilling to give this most-favoured-nation treatment to American citizens largely for reasons of amour-fropre. In their telegram No. 669 of the 1st March, 1932, to the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India expressed the view that I had perhaps exaggerated somewhat this sentiment. I can assure the Government of India that this is not so. His Highness spoke very strongly on the subject of these treaties, and asked whether the State was to be bound for ever by treaties entered into a century ago with his ignorant forefathers, and whether the State could not denounce them. ' Surely,' he said, ' there must be some way of ending a treaty.' He went on to ask why he should give the same treatment to American citizens as he accorded to British subjects; his relations with the British were totally different to those with any other State. He owed much to the British, but nothing to other countries. I could not help feeling much sympathy with His Highness's point of view. 6. Again, some Muscat subjects in Charbar are encountering certain difficulties about passports with the Persians, and have appealed to the Muscat State for assistance. His Highness has addressed a letter to the Political Agent saying that if his subjects in Charbar are ill-treated he will retaliate on Persian subjects resident in Muscat. I am investigating the matter, but merely mention these incidents now as examples of the feelings and character of the Sultan with whom we are called on to deal. ]■ Ihave always been anxious to encourage Arab rulers in the Persian Gult to administer their own States with as little interference by us in internal a airs as possible, ^ e are adopting this policy elsewhere, and it is in accordance with present-day views and sentiment; moreover, I believe it to be the most advantageous policy for ourselves, as was strongly emphasised by the Govern- , , 1 LJ eSpe T ct . of Bahrein 5 in their telegram No. 3458-S of the oyember, 1929, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. As regards e par icular case of Bahrein, owing to the total ineffectiveness and incompetence ot the present ruler, I see little alternative but virtually to carry on the administration of the State ourselves through the financial adviser, but I venture to express my entire concurrence with the general policy outlined in the e egram re eTred to above. I think there is no doubt that not only Bahrein, but wM ^ r i!? 8 ! a J cau f 1 of ' sl ^ ns of Arab uneasiness on the Trucial Coast,' nnf nr.1 S - a ^ ^ considerably to our difficulties there, and that ' after all it is Amh v ? s ~?

'When K.B. Shubaily had finished reading the Arabic translation a signal was made from the verandah of the Burza to the State Saluting battery which then fired 31 guns in honour of the Viceroy.

The Government of India have also read with interest the diecuESions held by the Political Resident with Hie Highness the Sultan regarding the possibility of denunciation by the Muscat &amp;tate of her Treaties with Foreign Powers. They had already given this question their careful consideration and had arrived at the following provisional conclusions. While ths Muscat Treaties both with France and America are drawn sub specie, aeternitatls* the authorities agree tbat all treaties are to be under? tood as having a tacit condition that they remain only valid gjo fetantibuB. Until the Great War it could not be said that there has been any material variation in the position which would Justify denunciation of her treaties by Muscat. Since the Great War there has been a tendency in all countries to raise tariff rates and it mi^ht lie held that in respect of the relevant Articles of these two Treaties things had now changed so much that denunciation y^o at those Article b would !&gt;• joetlf led» But^ are apparently an y where on record In whteh denunciation has not bean preceded either hy internal revolution or a one ▼ioleatiU&gt; r 3) Tioi.nt constitutional ohange . whioh produoed , dlffer#nt outlook on external affaire in the Government of the State responsible lor denunciation.

He is 5 however, inclined to think, subject to the observations of the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the balance of advantage rests witn making no communication to the Netherlands Government# Mi lie the I Netherlands Government have a Commercial Convention with Muscat, so far as is known traae between the two countries is negligible, if indeed it can be regarded as existing at all, and in view of the general unaesiraoility of encouraging any foreign interest in the petty principalities of one Ar^b Coast/ Under secretary of State, Foreign Office, 3 • W • 1. z , | f(U(i' ^ ' ■ /@) Cociso 01 thG Persian Gull, Sir S^-niuGl Hocir8, if sir John sii -on sees no strong objection, thinks that it you II he pr 3i era Die that in accordance with the precedent of 1913 no commuiiication should therefore he made to the Dutch Government and that the matter should be left to rest unless it is again raised by the Sultan.
