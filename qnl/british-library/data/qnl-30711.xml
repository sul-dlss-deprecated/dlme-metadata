Me should make every effort to have this paragraph dropped or, at all events, the powers contained in it considerably restricted. X agree with &gt;: r. Caroe* s views. Article 6 .

This would seem an unusual proviso in an Article dealing with Customs duty as it refers to goods produced in one part of the Sultan* s territory and transpor ted to another part, aiy duty on which should come under the heading of -ctroi, not lustoms. #e need not, however, raise any object! oti as this provides a safeguard that British subjects shall not pay ahy Octroi higher than that paid by the Sult&amp;n 9 s subjects or % tnose at the most favoured nation. Article 5. this /This This datj shall be paid at the : in fh® iul tan t e dm ini one etc* sentence refers (a) to good® grid merchandise imported from foreign countries an well as (b) to the produce of the .lultan*s dominions, ,\t the end of this paragraph it is stated that both classes shall be exempt from all such Customs duties, the word Ousto;as being used to cover tax on both (a) and ( bl, But though the correct term for the tax on (a, is Oust oias, that for the tax on (b), since the produce is of the Sultan 1 w territory itself, should be dtroi.

Article 8./remarks that this Article should have formed part of Article 6 but as the Multan wishes it to be separate we can agree* Paragraph 1* as far as i knew it is geher&amp;X cuetom in these days to pay in cash and this can be agreed to.

Mo cements* Ho objection to the slight alterations in this Article* In this Article two different classes of persons are dealt with, deserters from (a) His Majesty* s Ships (b) merchant vessels* ?Vitn regard to (a) such individuals will always be British subjects, but the offence is erne punishable under the Haval Discipline Act, which has not been .mode applicable to Muscat by the Muscat Order in Council. Such deserters therefore do not appear to come under ttie jurisdiction of the Political Agent* Similarly, persons under (b) do not prima facie commit a criminal offence in deserting, which is merely a breach of contract, and therefore also do not fall under the criminal jurisdiction of the Political Agent* I suggest accordingly that the whole of this Article be deleted from the new Treaty, especially as the ultan*a claim for reciprocal rights cannot, as Mr.Oaroe points out, be accorded. Article 12/-In so far a® this Article will, a© Mr#Oarpoint® out, render British subjects liable to taxation, the danger la that the iultan being a completely autocratic iuler, actual discrimination might well be made against British subjects under cover of a law which purports to be fair to all aff ected# What one has to remember in regard to this Article, and others giving increased power to the lultan to deal with British subjects, is that it may well be his general future policy to try and force British eubj ects to leave his territory by transferring the benefits bf trade from their hands to those of Ms own subjects* This, from his point of view, is quite understandable but, from our point of view, should of course be guarded against as much a® possible# We have had an unfortunate experience in Persia in the direction of British Indian trader® having to leave the country partly owing to the restrictions placed on their activities by the Per s ian Soy ernment • With regard to the example given by Mr#Oaroe of imposition by the Sultan of an Income tax, this or ary other tax imposed // ifapoeed by the Sul tan Id h&amp;v® to be enforced through the ^ditiaaX gent’s Jourt. This of course is some safeguard against dis crimination, as if discrimination were proved the 0ourt could refuse to enforce tae tax. With regard to cases of dispute between British subjects and members of other Christ I cm nations. I agree with Mr. O&amp;roe that in presert circuimitances such Qmm will b@ few. If, however, a fl ourishiag Oil J o; up any, by reason of the Petrol sum 0 oncers ions limited Oil concession, springs up in Muscat, as it has in Bahrain, then each eases may increase, but to no great extent as Petroleum Gone ess ions limited employees will be mainly British subjects. The Oompany itself, feeing a British Corporation, claims of British against employees ./it will fee decided in the Political Agent* s Court, an important point. If, however t the Sultan grants a concession to a foreign Company e.g# for oil in 0 wad or, which is not covered fey the Petroleum Cone ess ions limited concession, or for any other activity at her than oil in any part of his dominions, bath the Company and its foreign employees would not in any way be under the Jurisdiction of the 1 olitical Agent.

Even under present conditions, since the Political Agent has no police at hie disposal for the arrest of Individuals under hi© juris diction or to prevent a threatened breach of the peace, action to these ends must be left to the Muscat Govern ment, I am of opinion, therefore, that this paragraph should not be objected to.

The Foreign Office letter deals with a contingency which, it la to be hoped, may not arise. There appears to be nothing la the correspondence w iich has amm to our notice to suggest that the Idolta, has so far thought of requesting to be brought into direct rel^tiono with tne Foreign Office. a. There would appear to be several objections to such a development, and perhaps the strongest Is that which is recognised in paragraph 8 of the Foreign Office letter, via . , that it would ?*are f* A.' etcalfe, KCI&amp;. , ChT., ^'VO. , it/ Foreign .ecretary to the Govcmncnt of Indie, External Affairs iepart-lent.It vnort; difficult to a our excluglve influence ®ir®r the ^ultiu** Ther# In m\$vo&gt; %fa&lt;&amp; p-o#®ib't 1 itj 1 tHAt the ono® la ciln»et wtttx turn Foreign Office, might be the more XtScel/ to deei^e to laetitute direct diplomatic relet!one with foreign rowere, which might not necessarily be confined to those with whom m is already in treaty relationship and which might entail obviously undesirable c onse&lt;|ueac as* 4. Though there Is at present m indication that ths sultan la likely to raise the question of direct contact with tm Foreign Office, it is of course possible that he my do so as a result perhaps of getting new ideas into hi® head during his tour. Ta that event it would be a point for consideration whether he should be put In direct touch with the Foreign Office for the purposes only of his visit to .England and his entertainment as the guest of ills Majesty 1 e Government. Ivan if this were done, however It would doubtless be desirable that the India Office should/should be responsible for malting the necessary arrangements (with the assistance, It 1© hoped, of a i oil tlcal off tear from the Persian Gulf} for any business discussions with the &gt;ultan, and that it should be understood that the innovation did not imply any change in the general procedure for conducting relations with uscat. 5.

The appalling- trouble which we had with the Yemeni delegate to the coronation because he suspected that he was not being treated as the representative of an independent iate ought to be treated has perhaps made us unduly apprehensive of a repetition of trouble of this kind, even though the trouble would fall in the main upon a department other than ourselves. But the bultsn has been snowine;, a desire to take his own line In so many ways lately that it seems permissible to feel some anxiety lest sooner or later, and possibly on the occasion of his visit, he may seek to establish direct con .act with the Foreign Office. 3. You will remember that the legal position of the ultan of useat in regard to His Majesty's Government has recently been examined in a memorandum (of the 16th Hovember }/ J. . Gibson, . sq. , India Office, 0 %' 1 -^4 9 Xsmm 'u \ wmmmmrnamm—m 2 . November; by Beckett. Tats meraorandum shows that so far as treaty eng a gem exit a and similar undertakings are concerned Mis Majesty's Government have practically no ground, other than a promise given by the dultan on hio accession to be guided by their advice in H important affairs”, for maintaining tne practical control over the internal and external policy of the State of uscat which they have exercised by custom during the reign© of the more recent of the Sultan 1 s predecessors, 4. This being so, the practical position Is certainly unusual. For instance, hi© Majesty 1 © Government would almost certainly be bound in their own interests to defend the dultan against external aggression, and to some extent against internal disorder. Yet the State of uscat is not in any technical sense a ”Protected State”, much less a ’’iro tec to rate”.

Sultan gave no Indication here that he regarded his connection with Government of India as inappropriate and has not hitherto raised the matter in any way in his treaty negotiations except perhaps by omitting the title *His Highness* in his draft. Unless he acquires advanced ideas during his world tour we doubt il he will appreciate the difference fee i.ween the two departments of Hie Majesty's Government or raise the point of Afghan and Yemen cases ? which seem to us clearly distinguishable since in the first liberation from tutelage of Government of India had just been secured by what was represented as war for national independence and in the case of Yemen we presume relations with Colonial Office were resented as implying statue of British Golony. 3. Ghould dultan raise question in London we consider that he should be told that existing arrange ment is purely one of administrative convenience which in no way affects his international status. If ht is not satisfied we would agree to compromise on the lines suggested in paragraph 4 of your letter so far ae visit to England is concerned. Viceroy attaches however great importance/importance to maintenance of existing arrangements as approved by Cabinet under which India Office is 'senior partner' on arab littoral. In particular he regards it as essential that given relations of Kuscat with India and responsibility for financial and military commitments at nuscat, the Political agent or Consul should continue to be officer of Indian Political Cervice and that initiative in all maters of policy should rest with Secretary of atate for India. Should it therefore be decided to accord direct relations with Foreign Office in name la course from which Viceroy would be strongly averse) we should insist on similar procedure being adopted as is now in force for conduct of relations with Afghanistan and Sepal. We trust however that it will not be necessary to t o so far and that existing arrangements v^ill continue. 4. ,i.bove comments are subject to Fowls*a views which we have not yet received* aovmmnivs of imiATelegram 3 Political Resident, Busnire* From Secretary to tne Government of India, External Affaire Department, J^ew Delni Repeated His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, India office, London. ecretary of State for India m&gt;.109 Dated the 11th February 1958 Your telegram Ho. 25X dated 8t!i February 1938.

(b) It is not however impossible that he may raise thia question. If he does so I think we should fall in with his wishes without demur. Any opposition would, I think, exaggerate in his mind the importance we attach to this point, upset him at a time when owing to a treaty revision we want to keep him in a good temper, and perhaps aggravate him into raising the more important question of his future relations. 2.

It has been impressed upon him that discussions are only informal and that any draft discussed here is subject to further views of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. -RETAXANDUM-1*2U 'i$7/8B.

Coaid you ploase refer to Beckett 1 s memorandum of 18til ivovember enclosed with your demi-official letter !;o. . 7769/37 of 2nd December, which as the Foreign Office remark in paragra h 6 of their letter of the 23 th November is a very useful addit on to Laithwaite’a pre vious memorandum. 2. Personally I agree with Beckett's views ( aragra h 2 of his memorandum). as he joints out, the inclusion of the words ,! save to the British Government 1 ’ was both un necessary and unfox*tunate. However, the situation now would appear to be as stated in the last sentence of Beckett 1 3 paragraph 2, and is a point of some importance. 3* I also agree with ieekett # s view expressed in paragraph 3 ns to the possible deposing of the ,saltan* Juridiclal arguments apart, though such action may have been practicable in 1899* it is not so in 1938, and would raise a storm of criticism against ua not only in the .Arab res®, and Arab countries, but in European quarters which are only too ready, us we know, to seise any stick t:&gt; beat as with* the only occasion I can Imagine when we could tu e this extreme step would be in tin event of a major war* in which the Sultan either openly joined our enemies, or by his acts showed himself definitely hostile to uuu He would then be in the position of being at war with us, and would have to take the consequences. h* / J» &gt;&gt;dten, 1 b..,* , 0.B., *C♦, The India Office, London.2. 4. I also agree with the first .art of Beckett f g paragraph k* With regard t„ the last partof that paragraph, however, re the teraiaatioa of the Z&amp;nzUmr sabsidy, I doubt whether our position is as strong as suggested by Beckett, or perhaps I have read more into what he says than he intended. 5# The history of this subsidy is given In paragraphs 2 and 3 and 4 of Biscoe’s letter Ho* 70 -J, dated 12th February 1932 to the Government of India, a copy of which wao sent to the India Office. Briefly the case seems to be as follow®. The canning .award of 186.1 as t . this subsidy is given on page 303 of atenison’s Treaties, Vol* XI, and is unconditional. The duitan of Zanzibar failed in his payments to the Multan of Muscat (horimer ¥ol. I Part I page 4i0), and in 1873* His Ma^eaty , a Oovarmaent assomed r.sponsibillty for future payment®, the iultan being informed that it would be maintained ^so long as he continued faithfully to full'it hi® treaty unyagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Govern ment* M His Majesty f s Government had of course a perfect right to make this stipulation since they were assuming a responsibility for which they were in no way bound by the award, which was issued by the . acting as an arbitrator. In 1890 Sanaibar became, and still is, a British Protectorate. It therefore appears to me that from 1873 to 1890 the subsidy was subject to the condition laid down by His Majesty's Government, but that from 1890 onward®, His Majesty 1 s Government having take i over Zanzibar, assumed its liabilities, of which one was.the unconditional payment of the ,ansibar subsidy# In fact our/our position with regard to this liability is not ml ike that which we maintain to be that of the Iraq Government in the matter of the Shaikh of Koweit’s date gardens in Iraq* If I ai right in this assumption then the dansibar subsidy cannot of course be used as a lever for influencing the sultan in mw direction* This, of course, goes further than Biscoe*s conclusion at the end of his .am- graph h* 6. If I am not correct and the subsidy is subject to the conditions laid down in 1673&gt; even so I do not think that we can consider using the possibility of its termin ation as a lever for insisting on our being consulted on the Sultan’s relations wlto foreign Powers. such relations are not/precluded by his treaty engagements with us and therefore do not constitute a breach of the conditions of the grant of the subsidy* 7* The Government of India concurred with Biscoe’s views as given with his letter quoted above and accordingly the Oultan was informed that the subsidy was subject to his being on terms of amity and friendship with Hie Majesty’s Government and to his faithfully observing his treaty engagements (vide Bushire express Letter Mo. 600*1, dated 20th August 1932, to the Government of India). The alien in his reply, sent to the Government of India under my letter No* 0-55* dated 3th March 1955$ made no demur at the conditions attached to the continuetion of the subsidy. It is possible, however, that he may query these eonditi &gt;ns at some time in the future and it might be as well there fore for His Majesty’s Government to make a decision as to whether my assumption in paragraph 3 above is correct,in wnicii case the threat of withholding the subside;' cannot be used at all. Further* if lay assumption is incorrect then do w$ views as stated in paragraph 6 hold good ? 8* I am sending* 1 copies of this letter to he tea If e and Putts* Yours since rely 9 3d. T.C.

P^ment of ^anaiibar Sjbaiflv ** The question dealt with in Mr. aiason '3 letter of the 17th February and its enclosure^ (Sir T* lowie’s letter of the 7th January}, hecoi&amp;ea rather clearer if we take© events in their historical order and takce stock of the position at each relevant date. In 1Q61 the Canning award was given, under which Zanzibar had to pay a suesidy to Muscat. Under this award Zanzibar was trie debtor and, though I am not very well acquainted with the exact status of lanKibar at that time, X think it was quite definitely not a oritisn protectorate and inside the British empire in that sense. 2. In 1875 an arrangement seems to have been made, which was accepted by Zanzibar, Muscat and tne United Kingdom under which tne United Kingdom, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say her Majesty the vueen, became substituted for the Sultan of Zanzibar as tne debtor. Muscat thereby Obtainea, in place of a bad payer and &amp; ruler of perhaps uncertain financial soundness, a new debtor which was a good payer and of the highest financial soundness; therefore a great advantage to Muscat. In return, however, for tnis advantage a new condition was introduced, namely that the new debtor would be only bound to pay the subsidy for so long ae the ered!tor^continned faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards tne British Government'. The acceptance of this condition seems to me to l&gt;© part of the bargain by which Muscat acquired a much better debtor than it had previously had in respect of tnis subsidy. Zanzibar I think/think muse be regarded as having ,one out of the picture from this date, as far as Muscat is concerned. 3. In 1890 the status of Zanzibar changed. It became a British protectorate and part of the British Bmpire out it seems to me tnat&gt; as Zanzibar had already disappeared from the picture this change in the position of Zanzibar nad no effect whatever in regard to the conditions on which the su aid^ was payable to Muscat. If in 1873 Her Majesty had not become substituted for tne Sul^an of Zanzibar as the debtor, tnen the change in the position of Zanzibar would have had the result, not that tne suosidy was payaole out of the revenues of the United Kingdom or any other part of the British empire except Zanzibar, out that her Majesty as the protecting Power was oound oy international law to see that tne Sultan of Zanzibar managed nis revenues reasonably prudently and paid nis subsidy dent punctually Whenever these revenues permitted him to ao so. But in any case the point is, I tninic, irrelevant seeing that 2.anzloar had disappeared out of the picture ao far as Muscat was concerned seventeen years earlier. 4. The position therefore remains that the subsidy is payable by His Majesty subject to tne condition which I have mentioned. This condition remains, out legally I think we are not entitled to add further conditions without the Sultan of Muscat 1 ® consent. 5. The question whether His Majesty's liability to pay this subsidy snould fall u*&gt;on India, upon the United Kingdom or should once more fall upon Zanzibar is of course a purely domestic matter which in no way concerns the Sultan of Muscat.

A copy lias been sent to by || Man. 4963 2000 7.36/ Z.2664/38. India Office ? Whitehall, London, S.W.1. 14th Apri1, 1938. Muscat Trea ty. %C4U, With reference to the Secretary of State’s telegram of to-day on the subject of the Treaty discussions 'with the Sultan of Muscat, I am desired to forward for information (1) a copy of the provisional draft treaty, prepared in the light of the Government of India’s views and in consultation with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, which was offered to His Highness on the 30th March, (2) notes of the five meetings at which the draft was discussed with the Sultan, and (3) a copy of the letter sent to His Highness on the 11th April, enclosing a revision of the provisional draft. The provisional draft proceeds on the basis that trie Sultan's fiscal powers in relation to British subjects are limited only by the obligation to give both national and most favoured nation treatment. n national” treatment has been introduced in Article 3 of the provisional drax t, end to this Article the Sultan has taken no exception. rey Metcalfe, KCiS., CSI., MVO., retary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department. In/In preparing the draft a number of drafting amendments have been made-in the text of the existing treaty and in other ways it has been modernised as far as seems desirable. 3. Of the Sultan’s draft, Articles 7 (Shipping dues), 11 (deserters from Ships) and 17 (municipal taxes) have been omitted, while Article 19 (expulsion of British subjects) has been withdrawn by the Sultan himself. It is not considered necessary to retain provisions similar to those of his Articles 11 and 17, but an Article relating to shipping dues is desirable, as otherwise the Sultan will be completely free in the matter, subject to the provisions of Article 3 of the revised provisional draft. 4. Article 8 of the revised provisional draft (import and export restrictions) has been inserted in substitution for Article 4(2) of the Sultan’s draft. ^ 5. The Articles of the existing Treaty dealing with jurisdiction have been considerably redrafted, on the basis that, while jurisdiction is reserved in civil and criminal cases against British subjects, ex-territorial rights generally are surrendered. In the absence of Omani legislation applicable to the case the British Consul would be free to apply whatever laws His Majesty’s Government desired/I 3 /JV desired in t]ie exercise of his jurisdiction over British siiDjects. But } since it would follow that in the absence of any other provision the Sultan would be free to legislate for British subjects in all matters, an Article (Article 14 01 the provisional draft), to which special importance is attached, has been introduced to ensure to us a right of control over the application of Omani laws and regulations to British subjects. Much difficulty is being experienced in securing the Sultan’s acceptance of this Article. It is gathered that he would not wish to interfere with the application to British subjects in the Consul’s Court of the body of law applied un-er the existing Order in Council. What particularly concerns him is his aesire to have an unrestricted right to tax all residents in his territories and to avoid any deJ&amp;y in the imposition of taxes and particularly of customs duties. The original draft has been amended in the hope of making it more acceptable to him in this respect. 6. Among other points unaer discussion in the provisional draft are the following:- (a) Article 1: Definition of Nationals of His Majesty as extending to all British protected persons. Here Bowie sees no objection (subject to the Government of India's/(jij /Jt India 1 s views) to excluding the subjects of the Gulf States, and the Colonial Office arc being consulted in respect of the Aden Protectorate and Zanzibar. (b) The provision inserted in Article 2 (1) relating to the movements ox British subjects in Muscat, put forward on Fowls's suggestion, as a substitute for the Sultan's audition in Article 4 paragraph 1 of ms di af o, wi ivi tne object of preventing the movements of British traders from being hampered by the imposition of unreasonable restrictions by the Sultanate authorities. (c) Monopolies* Article 2, (2) and (3), based on Article 14 of the Anglo Siamese Treaty of 1925 has been plf©posed to the Sultan in place of Article 4 (3; ox his draft, but so far -it has been impossible to secure his agreement. ( d) Re stri ction on the sale etc. of i mao vable propert,v. The Sultan insists on retaining Article 5 ox his u - r ai. u. (e) Article 5 (6). The Sultan insists that weigninQ fees should be included, asserting that all the lees hexe mentioned have been levied for years past, having been introduced with the concurrence of the Political Agent when the Muscat customs arrangements were reorganised in 1920, and therefore that the exclusion of weighing xees w o ’ll d/5 v/ould deprive hiiu 01 a recognised right, His assertion cannot oe checKeo. here in the absence of detailed iniomarion regarding the reorganisation of the Muscat customs. (j.) Article 6 (2). The Sultan objects to the draft, partly on the ground that 'wholesale 11 is, according to him, a meaningless term in relation to Muscat where all the trace is retail, partly for the imaginary reason that the final worms of the paragraph would deprive him of part of his existing revenue. He wishes to retain the phrase employed in his own Article 8, paragraph 2. 7. There is not sufficient time to obtain the Government of India’s views on these and other points before the - discussions with the Sultan are continued next week. It has however been mane clear to him that the discussions are informal and that the provisional draft is subject to the further views of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India. 8.

Note of first meeting Y/ith the Sultan, 30 th llarch at The Dorchester Hotel. Present: His Highness the Sultan, The Political Resident (Sir xrenchard Towle), and Hr. J.u.G-ic Office). Ids on (India Sir Trenchard Towle began by saying that His majesty ! s Government welcomed, as he understood the Sultan did also, the opportunity afforded by the presence of His Highness in London to have an informal discussion of the Sultan’s proposals for the revision of the 1891 Treaty and to explain 'to His Highness the conclusions which His Majesty’s Government had provisionally reached in the light of the views expressed by the Government of India. The matter had been discussed that very morning by the Departments concerned, and, while an important part of the Treaty proposals had still to be examined by them, he was able to give the Sultan His Majesty’s Government’s provisional draft of the earlier articles of the Treaty. Sir Trenchard then gave His Highness a draft, as in the copy attached herewith, of the Preamble and Articles 1 to 10. He explained that there was no guestion of the Sultan committing himself at this stage and that he proposed, after going through the draft and explaining the variations from the Sultan’s proposals, to leave it to be considered by His Highness at his leisure. He then proceeded to explain the draft Article by Article. The Sultan’s comments were as follows Preamble : no comment. Article l(i): Tor the phrase ’’Muscat and Oman and Their/1 W Iheir Dependencies u His Highness said he v/as inclined to prefer simply 4 Oman'. ^ The phrase 'all persons under His Majesty's protection puzzled His Highness who remarked that it was more extensive than the phrase in the existing Treaty (vhicn was limited to the subjects of the Indian States) anc ^ sa ict that he would wish to have a definition of it ? as otherwise he might be at a loss to know whether he or His Majesty’s Consul was entitled to have jurisdiction over a particular person. \7ith regard to the definition of the Sultan's subjects His highness thought it should cover all persons under his jurisdiction, i.e. in addition to his own subjects, foreigners in his territory other than British subjects and British protected persons. It was explained to him that the term 'Nationals of His Majesty' did not include foreigners who being in British territory were subject to His Majesty’s jurisdiction. The Sultan apparently thought that some such phrase was needed to balance the reference to persons under His Majesty's protection. He wished to consider the extension of the term 'Nationals' to cover 'corporate bodies'. Article l(iii) : For 'Muscat!' His Highness preferred 'Omani', and wished the definition of his ships to read 'all ships registered by the Oman Government and entitled to fly the flag of the Sultan'. A rticle 1(iv) ; His Highness tnought it would be desirable to insert a definition of Omani Aircraft. Article 2( 1); His Highness pressed for the omission of the words 'in the hinterland of Muscat'. For/1920/ 3 For the v/ords ,f of all foreigners” at the end of the second sentence he preferred a reference to the most favoured nation ( $t of the nationals of the most favoured foreign country”). Arti cle 2 (2) and (3 )° His Highness wished to think over these provisions regarding monopolies (particularly v/ith reference to the question of' compensation) and desired to knov/ v/hether they occurred in other Treaties, he was informed that this was so and that the iDrovisions v/ere in fact hased on those in a recent Treaty with His Majesty's Government. Article 5 (Lj.)(h): His Highness Y/ished to consider whether the words Manifested and consigned” v/hich appeared in his draft ought to he retained. Article 3 (5) ° For the prox^osed 'Six” months at the beginning of this paragraph His Highness preferred to retain the ‘'three” months of his draft explaining that warehousing space in Muscat was very limited and that embarrassment might be caused if goods were allowed to lie in it for so long as six months. Article 3 (6) : His Highness promised to give an explanation of the terms used in his draft ? which had been supiplied to him by his Director of Customs. He t t said that ail these fees* including Y/eighing charges, had been levied at Muscat for many years past by an arrangement approved by the Political Agent. To cut out an item like 'weighing charges” would therefore be to deprive him of a right which he already enjoyed. Sir Trenchard observed that presumably His Highness referred to the reorganisation of the Muscat Customs by an Officer of the Indian Customs Service in aboutr ¥ 1920. His Highness confirmed tnis. Article 6 (2) ; His Highness wished to omit the word ’'wholesale l ' ? explaining that it had no meaning in Muscat, where all the trade was re ta il trade, the merchants during wholesale in India and selling in small Quantities in Muscat. Ar bicle 7 ° His Highness wished to consider this further. Article 8 ( 3 ) : His Highness wished to consider this ’’exceptions” paragraph further. Apart from the above comments His Highness raised no objection to Articles 1 to 10 on his first reading of them. It was arranged that the next meeting should be held on Friday, 1st April at 4&lt;&gt;45 p.m.MUSCAT TREATY. Note of second meeting with the Sultan; 1st April. Present: H.II. the Sultan ? sir Trenchard Powle and Mr. J. P. G-ib s on. j.ne ieinaining .nrtic±es 02 the provisional redraft of the Treaty were given to the Sultan (as in the copy attached) and were briefly explained to him. the A rticl e 11. His Highness word ''possible” before 'aid” suggested the insertion o r 5 ' a s s i s t a n c e ” i n of paragraphs (1) and (2). AM AifjlG is (2) . Although it was pointed out to His Highness that there was nothing in this paragraph to fetter his jurisdiction he objected to the inclusion of the second sentence unless accompanied by a reciprocal provision for the attendance of a representative of His Highness at the hearing by the British Consul of proceedings instituted against a British subject by one of his subjects. He said that it would always be open to a British subject who thought he had been unjustly treated to appeal to the British Consul to make representations on his behalf. Article 12 (4) . His Highness objected to the latter part of this paragraph, stating that he would not ask for the expulsion of a British subject without good reason and that his request ought to be accepted without being subjected to investigation by the British Consul Article 15 . His Highness wished to insert the word ’’possible” before 'aid”. A rticle 14 . His Highness took exception to the second and third sentences, which he said would put him in an awkward position because they differentiated too much in favour/7, i 1 y\| 2 . Qg) r T.Fowle nted out he did third: that lelay was to usj as ad been ing for List of 3 and. 3 from yluscat prune nt. favour of British subjects. He was anxious to give eouality of treatments but these provisions would noke it impossible for him to anticipate that a new tax would, apply to all alike, and if the procedure contemplated in the last sentence were carried out years might elapse before taxes could be imposed, on British subjects. His experience with regard, to the introduction of municipal taxation did not encourage him to think that the delay entailed by the procedure would be only negligible. 35 Article 15 . His Highness would prefer the omission of this Articles which he said would put him in an awkward position notwithstanding that no effect could be given to it without his consent. Article 16 . His Highness wished to consider this further 4 Article 17 . His Highness had no comments. C Article 18 . His Highness could not understand the last four words. (it will be explained to him that these Vi/ords only mean that most-favoured-nation treatment must be extended to British subjects without waiting for any request for it on their part and without making it conditional on some counter-consideration to be given by them). Articles 19-21 . His Highness desired to consider these further. There was not time to explain them in detail, but he was told that they were common form in treaties now made by H. M, G. Article 22 . His Highness appeared disappointed at the provision that the Treaty would not come into foxce before next February, He was informed tnat it arose from the circumstance/f circumstance tliafc certain Dominions Lore a napty to tho existing treaty^ and tnat ? if it were proposed to terminate the present treaty before the end of the period for which it was extended consultation with the Dominions concerned would 'be necessary and v/ould probably entail such delay as might in any case prevent the new Treaty from coming into force before next February. It was arranged that the next meeting should be held on Wednesday morning* 6th April....Muscat Treaty . Hote of third meeting with His Highness the Snlhnn 7th April. Ji “ an ’ present His Highness, Sir T.Powle, and Mr.Gibson. -t was suggested, ana His Highness agreed, that the most convenient plan to those concerned for the conduct of the discussions after the 11th April would be for His Highness to go to Paris, as arranged, on the 12th April, spend a week there and return to London on the 19th or 20th April. Sir T. ‘owle said he would in the circumstances postpone his departure until the 27th April. The draft Treaty previously left with His Highness was u.,ie,n taicen up and the following Articles were discussed: (•*-) ■ f?or 'the final words His Highness said he definitely preferred 'Oman and its Dependencies', omitting the reference to Muscat. (ii) His Highness took strong exception to the inclusion in tue definition of 'British protected persons' ••oi the purposes of the Treaty of the natives of the tritcries in Arabia under His Majesty’s protection, particularly the natives of Xoweit, Bahrein, Qatar, the xracial Coast and the Aden Protectorate. About Palestine he was not sure. He felt that it would be inconsistent vita his position as an independent Arab Ruler if the Arabs Oa tne neighbouring territories were withdrawn from his jurisdiction. He was not satisfied with the explanation that His Majesty’s Government were bound to give to the natives of the territories named above the same protection m foreign countries as would be given to British subjects. As regards corporate bodies His Highness was told that imis definition was common form and was essential in a Despite the explanations given he’still wished/ commercial treaty.wished to think the matter over and asked to be sup-plied Wlth a written explanation of the meaning and effect of the phrase. he was told that the Board of Trade would be asked to supply this. ' n iH 1 ' (iv) and (v) His Highness again represented that territory under the protection of His Majesty should not include the territories of the Arab States under His Majesty’s protection. In (iii) .Lis Majesty objected to the phrase, ships registered ’’under the law of any part of the British Commonwealth &amp;c. !! His objection appeared to be that it mi gut be possible for a Muscat! to secure for his dhow the treatment accorded to British ships by having the dhow given through the British Consul a registration, e.g. in Australia or Canada. He suggested the substitution of the phrase - registered 'in the territories of His Majesty'. The real objection to this amendment (that in virtue of the definition oi 'territories” it would exclude from the definition of British ships ships registered in the Dominions which do not accede to the Treaty) was not explained to His Highness but he was told that his fears were unfounded, that it was believed that British law would require the owner of the ship to be domiciled (or if a company, registered) in the territory in question, and that the phrase in the draft was common form. He asked that here also he might be given an explanation in writing and was promised that this too would be sought from, the Board of Trade. Article 2 (l): Eis Highness pressed his previous objections to the insertion of the words 'in the hinterland of Muscat”. He also wished to delete the word ’’lawlessness' and the reference to notificati on. He said that Indian traders were settled at various ports in Oman and he had no wi sh/3. wish to turn them out. But difficulty might arise when a trader wisued to go t o some other place in his territory which Indian traders did not frequent; he might not be in a position to protect such persons and yet would be held responsible by His Majesty’s ‘Government if anything happened to them. After much discussion he said he would not object ii an arrangement was made by which an Indian trader, wishing to move to some other place in Oman, should be required to inform the local authorities, who might in certain cases think fit to notify him that owing to conditions of insecurity the place proposed to be visited was unsafe, and if it was understood that no responsibility for the person's safety attached to the Sultan’s Government if, notwithstanding the notification, he should proceed to carry out his proposed visit. The Sultan drew attention to the phrase regarding the conditions and regulations applicable to his nationals when visiting the territories of His Majesty and claimed that he should not be denied any right of controlling the movements of British subjects within his territory, where conditions were much more insecure. (2) and (3): Hig Highness complained, almost bitterly, that these paragraphs about monopolies would leave him no free hand. He was not interested in an offer to make them reciprocal, as he had no trading interests likely to be affected by British monopolies. Only about a third oi Muscat trade v/as in the hands of British Indian traders. His own people would therefore be proportionately more aifected than British subjects by the creation of monopolies. He was, however, very anxious to avoid disturbing trade, on the contrary he wished to see trade between India and muscat increase. It was represented to him that by tne present draft His Majesty’s Government were making a considerable advane e/4. advance in tna.'t biie t y vvere wi ill dr awing iiie existing pi Oiii Oxtion on monopolies ana were anxious to insert the pie sent paragrapns only as a safeguard against any serious dibourLance ox trade or ox the interests of British traders vv’nicii i^ignu result from the exercise of the Sultan’s freedom co create monopolies. For this reason they attachea imporcanoe to the inclusion of these paragraphs, ixie oulban gave no indication that he was ©pared to accept tne paragraphs, which were left over for further discussion. Article 5 . The Sultan has no objection. Article 4 . His Highness is anxious to draw a distinction between immoveable and moveable property, giving m.f.n. treatment in respect of both but national treatment only in respect of the latter. He would accept the Article if the last phrase ran, H on the same conditions in respect of immoveable property as are or may be established with regard to the nationals ox the most favoured foreign country and in respect of moveable property as are or may be established with regard to the nationals of the Sultan or the nationals of the most favoured foreign country 11 . Article 5, (4)(b ) For the phrase n not being consigned”, which in the Sultan’s draft was amended to ”not being manifested and consigned”, he now wishes to substitute the phrase in Article 5 (4) (a), vis. 'not being destined and manifested”. Article 5 (6 ) His Highness explained that ”landing fees” were'/pald to the man who performs lighterage (which is given out on contract). The word T ’or” should oe inserted between ’’wharfage” and ’’ground rent”, tne latter being levied in the ports where there were no wharves, and either term being equivalent to demurrage or warehousing charges/5 . charges. Kis Highness repeated that weighing charges were introduced in the reorganisation of the Muscat customs in 1920 j and should he retained, article 6 (2). His Highness said again that the term ’'wholesale 1 ' is meaningless in Muscat, and argued that the qualification ’’less the customs duties payable on importation' would in effect deprive him of a certain amount of revenue which he had derived in the past, and would only P ut some extra profit into the pockets of the traders who would continue to sell at the old retail price while paying less duty. He would not object to 'ready money retail market price' but otherwise preferred no change. His attention was drawn to the Indian practice as shown by sections 22 and 30 of the Indian Sea Customs Act, 1878, and he was told that the draft was an attempt to introduce a more rational procedure based on the recognised practice elsewhere. His Highness, however, insisted that what was a suitable system xcr highly developed conditions elsewhere was not appropriate uO the conditions in Muscat, and he therefore wished things to go on as in the past. Ain H-cle 6 (5) . His Highness said that he now thought it unreasonable, s ceing that Indian traders dealt with only a third or Muscat trade, that the tariff board should consist G - numbers of the Sultan’s subjects and British subjects, re would prefer to amend his draft so that the numbers of either nationality were proportionate to their interest in Muscat -rade. If was represented to him that it would be very difficult to give effect to such a provision and further that, nndcr the Sultan's own proposal, the tariff board consisted of ■live persons so that British subjects were in a permanent minority. This did not seem to move His Highness who said he would think the matter over. = : -rticlc 7. His Highness has no objection. Article 8,/6 . : His Higliness proponed the addition of the words '’or religious belief” at the end of para.3 ic), but did not press it when it was explained to him paragraphs (l) and (2) allowed him power to impose any prohibitions or restrictions on imports provided there was no discrimination against His Majesty’s Government. He said that he was thinking of such a thing as alcoholic liquors. He agreed that whatever prohibition ne put on the importation of alcoholic liquors would not extend to prohibiting such importation for the use of the British Consulate. His Highness suggested the omission of para.3 (b) dealing with traffic in arms, etc. His suggestion was noted for consideration. Article 9 : Ho objection. Article 1 0 : Ho objection. It was arranged that the next meeting should be held on Friday, 8th April, at 10 a.m.muscat tkkaty. Note of fourth meeting with Hio Highness the Sultan, 8 th April. Present: His Highness, Sir T. Pov/le and Mr. Gibson. The following points were dealt with. Article 2(1): In place of the words n except that, as regards nationals of His Majesty, special permission shall have to be obtained before entering those places in the hinterland of Muscat which owing to conditions of lawlessness and insecurity shall have been notified unsafe b 5 r the local authorities” the Sultan, who objected to the phrase on several grounds, was prepared to accept something on the following lines:- ’'Nationals of His Majesty shall. before proceeding from the place where they reside to another place in the territories of the Sultan, notify the local Omani authorities of the place in which they reside, and such authorities shall inform them whether the intended- destination is suitable for them to travel to or nos. If the authorities in question notify the said nationals in writing that the intended destination is unsuitable, and if the said nationals persist in travelling to their destination, or should they fail to notify the local authorities of their intended movements, then they wxll proceed at their own risk /and if harm befall them no claim will lie against the Omani Government^?' (the words in brackets to be omitted if it transpires that Aiep ai6 covered by ”at their own risk”). It was explained to His Highness that a provision of this kind was suggested in order to avert the risk of local autnoritieo noi^— &amp; up/up the movements of Indian traders for quite insubstantial reasons. Article 2,(2}_and_m, His Highness ashed whether his view would he met by the substitution of some such phrase as 'Should the Sultan wish to establish any monopoly in his territory such monopoly will be arranged in such a wav that i+ ,,-h i i -u - , ^ tnat Wl11 not bo detrimental to the trade of British svh ir-'p-f--• ?! ^ r+■ ° — a j cc oo • rie at one e enqui red who was to decide what was 'detrimental” and said he tad not wish to leave open any grounds for disputes between him and His Majesty’s Government. Hhen pressed to explain his objections to the present draft he said he had no intention of doing anything which might aifect trade between Muscat and British territories, and therefore accepted the principle of the draft article uown to the word ’’Parties”: but ho wished to be free to institute a monopoly affecting trade inside his territories, and even here he had not in mind anything which would interfere with existing trade e, g. tiiat in rice. What he was thinking of was circumstances m which, wishing to encourage the setting up of an ice plant, he should give a monopoly for the manufacture of ice; or, to take another example? a monopoly for the sale of beef. The paragraphs were left for further consideration in the light of His Highness’s views. Article 6(3)« The Sultan said he was willing to agree to the provision in the existing draft providing for equal numbers of Muscat! and British Nationals on the board, under the presidency of the Director of the Sultan’s Customs. Article/Article 12. (l)(i) His Highness proposed the omission of the words H and courts’'. (1) (iv) His Highness asked for, and was promised, an explanation of 'questions of personal status'. (2) His Highness preferred in the first sentence 'The Courts' of the Sultan. He maintained his objection to the second sentence as a reflection on the standard of justice administered in his courts, and said he could not agree to it even if a reciprocal provision were inserted allowing an opportunity for his representative to be present in the Consul’s court. If a British subject ’were dissatisfied with the decision of the Sultan’s Court he would have a right of appeal to the Sultan himself. (3) His Highness desired that in the latter part of the paragraph an insertion should be made giving his authorities also the right of entry and search, i.e. that words similar to those in the beginning of the paragraph should be inserted in the latter part. (4) After considerable discussion directed to showing His Highness that the Consul had not a free hand for the deportation of British subjects and that some such prevision as was proposed in our draft was necessary in our viev/ one Sultan desired the cancellation of the whole Amclo. ho said he could not agree to any provision requiring uhe production, or taking, of evidence in connexion with a request Ox his for the expulsion of a British subject, and he therefore preferred to withdraw the .article suggested in his drafo (Article 19). Article 14. So far as this Article was discussed i 0 became clear that the Sultan’s objection, at least as stated by him on this occasion, was to the delay wrich lie alignt GXjjGiience, the proposed procedure, in imposing taxes and ao bove/ as a result of4 / 4- ; :: above all in imposing customs duties. A delay of ten days after publication of the proposed duties would, he said, enable traders to import goods from India before the duties -ere enforceable and so mould deprive him of revenues. Further consideration of the Article mas promised. As his Highness maintained his objection to chis Article ic mas agreed that it should be omitted. His Highness desired the insertion of a provision relating to nationals of His Majesty in the Sultan’s service which would enable notice to be given to him before they were arrested. Article 18. The meaning of the words 'without request or compensation' was explained to the Sultan but he pressed for their omission and this was agreed to. The Sultan referred to Article 7 of his draft, regarding harbour dues etc. He was asked to accept Article 8 of the existing Treaty, but objected on the ground that he wanted, or might want, to raise funds for the improvement of his harbours. He said he was quite willing to leave undisturbed the existing li hts maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee, He was prepared to jjay a subsidy to cover the cost of the lights which would be deducted from the dues collected by him. He was further prepared to agree that such harbour dues should be levied on a scale corresponding to that levied by international custom, and he would agree to British representation on the special board provided for in his draft. He was promised that the matter would be considered in the light of what he now said. The next meeting was arranged for Saturday morning, 9th April.* KUSCAT TBBATY ? ee !* n e with His Highness the Suitan^ 9th April. Present : His Highness, Sir T. Pov/le and Mr. Gibson. The following matters were dealt with.:- —i° - i -tie oultan asked that from the term 5 ! 'oerso r ;s under His Majesty’s protection' should he excluded the subjects of Koweit ? Bahrein ? Qatar ? the Trucial Sheikhs, the Aden Protectorate and also of Zanzibar, and similarly that these territories should be excluded from the territories under His Majesty’s protection referred to in (iii ), v iv) and. (v). He wished the exclusion to operate throughout all the Articles of the Ireaty and not only in respect of those dealing with personal jurisdiction. He was told that the Government of India would be consulted in respect of the Persian Gulf States, and the Colonial Office regarding the Aden Pj^otectorate and Zanzibar. (ii). His Highness would like a note assuring him, with regard, to 'corporate bodies', (a) that individual employees of a Company, if not British subjects, would be unconditionally subject to his jurisdiction, and (b) that in case of conflict between the terms of a concession given to a Company (or other contract between the Sultan and a Company) and the terms of the Treaty, the terms of the concession etc. would prevail. Subject to the above, His Highness was satisfied with this clause, and also with the reference to registration of British shipping in (iii), in the li^'ht of the explanations supplied by the Board of Trade. Article 2 flM The amendment suggested at the fourth meeting was/was further discussed and, v/i accepted by the Sultan. b £ i one or two amendment; /as ikn njcle 2 ( 2 ) and (5) . Toe fold nv-; no- -n , . —i —^— L . loi.j.owj.ng alternative w suggested to the Sultan:- 'I’ne Sultan will not establish in his territory any monopoly in respect of a trade in which nationals of His Majesty are at the time engaged without compensating such nationals for their loss of business either by permitting them to share in the monopoly on equitable terms or otherwise, further, the Sultan undertakes to secure that any monopoly established oy him shall interfere as little as possible with the trade between the territories of the High Contracting Parties.' ^i° ^igfr-oess uau no objection to the second sentence. Further, he said that if we wished it he was quite prepared to accept the first sentence also, but he -'minced out onat it left him free on his return to Oman to institute monopolies in every matter in which 3i itisn Indian Graders were not now doing business, thus preventing tnern from acquiring any claim to compensation in such matters in the future. The question was left over for further consideration and discussion. Arti cle 4. might It was proposed to His Highness that a sentence be added to the existing draft as follows 'Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph of this Article the Sultan may impose restrictions on the purchase of land outside the towns in his territories by nationals of His Majesty provided that the same restrictions are imposed on the/the nationals of the most favoured foreign country.' He said this did not meet him, as he wished to exercise a control over the acmri o-i cquioioion oy foreigners or *•»«*». both lana aM itllIilng0i Ur retiring, as la his draft, that poraissioo shoold oe obtained.. He remarked thot’-e-H-, -f-v . , . Lria ° v/j - th trie existing draft, With or Without the proposed addition, it was 0 pen to him, without infringement of the Treaty, to secure his object by issuing orders to his own subjects that no immovable property was to be disposed of to foreigners without his permission. The orders would not apply directly to British subjects: the latter when desiring, say, to hire or purchase a shop, would approach an Omani subject for the purpose, that is, *£ dealings would oe with a private individual, not with the Omani Government, while the Omani subject before consenting to dispose of the property v/ould refer to the Sultanate authorities for permission. The Sultan would outwardly he controlling only the actions of his own subjects, as he was entitled to do, and yet would be able to secure his object. His Highness therefore suggested the retentio: of his own draft (i.e. the proviso to his Article 5 ). Sul Gan’ s Article 7 ('k^a rb our due s) His Highness proposed, that the three points which he was prepared to accept in respect of this Article (see note of fourth meeting) should be recorded in a letter and not in the Treaty itself, since he wished to avoid hampering his freedom in negotiating a treaty with a foreign power (particularly in regard to British representation on the special board). Article 12 (lUiv^. It was explained to His Highness that questions of/J of personal status related to family law generally (marriage, divorce, legitimacy etc.). He said he wished that any dispute of this kind between Moslems, c.g. divorce proceedings, in which one of the parties ±0 an should he tried hy Sharia law, i.e. in a Moslem poll (73 ous rni-,^ \ j- * -i ° CUUx Apbicle leaves this optional in the case of Moslems generally; K is Highness wished it to he obligatory where an Omani is a party to a dispute. Article 12 (2). Ox cue secona sentence His Hjghness is prepared to accept a sentence suggested to him pro via ea it runs as follows: - ’’The national of His ha jo sty shall have a right of appeal to the Sultan, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Omani Courts, against any decision given against him in any such case if the Consul of His Majesty shall so request, If the Sultan should, be absent the appellant may, if he so desires, ask that the appeal may be heard by the Sultan's representative. ” Article 12 TM . An amendment to cover the point mentioned by His Highness at the fourth meeting was given to him. He also asked that the proviso in this paragraph should be extended, to enable his officials to arrest a British subject who was found breaking a regulation of the Sultan which had been published and communicated to the British Consul. Article 14. His Highness made the following woints, He i s anxious/5 . anxious to be able to impose customs duties without delay. he would accept an amendment providing that legislation imposing taxes or duties should, be exhibited automatically. He would prefer to substitute -tor a suitaole period*' for the reference to the period of ten days etc . 9 leaving the exact period to be settled oy an exchange of letters. In the last sentence v/uicn would no\j refer so legislation other than that imposing taxes or duties* he wished to substitute consider mio maccer 5 ' ior “consider the withdrawal of his reguest or a modiiication of the law or regulation in guest ion*' ? and was anxious that delay should, be avoided in the event of the matter being submitted to His Majesty’s Government. Further, he wanted liberty to apply to British subjects temporary emergency legislation in the interests of public security. Article 16 . His Highness v:ould accept this Article, subject to the deletion of the words “and sufficient evidence proceeded with” and “discharge such person from his service”, and to the addition of the following sentence: “No criminal or civil proceedings shall be taken before the consular authorities of His Majesty against any national of His Majesty in the service of the Sultan unless notice of the proceedings has been previously given to the Sultan or his representative.“ It was agreed that the next meeting should be held on Wednesday, 20 th April, after the return of His Highness from Paris and that a revised draft of the Treaty should if possible be given to him before leaving London,Your Highness s INDIA OFFICE, yhitehall, LONDON; 3.#.1. 11th April, 1938 as was promised to Your Highness at our last meeting I enclose herewith a copy of a revised provisional draft of the Treaty which embodies the results of the informal conversations which Sir Trenchard Fowle and I have so far had with Your Highness, and which also includes a number of small verbal improvements in the text given to Your Highness at our first meeting.
