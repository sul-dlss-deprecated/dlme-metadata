He mentions his participation in the demonstrations at Tahrir Square on January 25 and 28, 2011, in his words not as an artist but as an Egyptian. He characterizes the art produced after the revolution as part of the “train of change” launched on January 25, 2011, and speaks about his own work, intended to inspire others and promote change. This includes the documentary he filmed during the 2012 presidential election campaign, “Youm El Nasr”  (Day of Victory). ###### describes the making of the film, which includes his interviews with people at Tahrir Square about their opinions of the elections and the candidates they supported, as well as footage of the celebrations that erupted when results were announced.</dc:description><dc:date>2012-07-11</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>20120711</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
