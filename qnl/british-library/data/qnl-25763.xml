Enquiries have been instituted by the Political agents concerned in their areas, and the results of their investigations may be summarised as follows: Kuwait. Political Agent reports that spurious rupee coins made in Basra, Amarah etc, by the Iraqi Subbalan silversmiths are imported into Kuwait where they are either re-sold or exported to India. There are no Subbaa in Kuwait and no coins are made locally. The Political .Agent has been informed by the Kuwait Oil Company, who handle large sums monthly, that the number of spurious coins appears to be diminishing and may now be estimated at l/2fi of coins in circulation. Five spurious coins from Kuwait are enclosed. S/44.

Reference your i , lo.C y /464«9/10 of 6th August, 1939, regard ing counterfeit rupees. 2. Some three or four years ago there appeared to he an excessive number of counterfeit rupees in Bahrain. Investiga tions were made and it was found that apparently counterfeit rupees were being brought in from abroad, mostly from India. A watch was put on and imported silver was examined. In a few months the amount of counterfeit coins was reduced to a very small proportion. At present, as iar as can be ascertain ed, very few counterfeit coins are in currency in Bahrain. 3. There was at this time an unauthenticated rumour that coins were being manufactured in ^4attar, this rumour existed when Bahrain and Qjattar were on friendly terms. 4 . It is my considered opinion that the manufacture of counterfeit coins in Bahrain on a large scale would be impossible. Bahrain is such a small place th&amp;t an influx of counterfeit coins would be noticed immediately and an export of coins from Bahrain, except during the regular season, would immediately create attention. 5 # if any persons were suspected of being implicated in making or passing false coins they would immediately be placed under police surveillance. I am, however, giving special instructions to the Police to look into the matter. sd. C.Dalrymple Bel grave, Adviser to the Government\' Confidential * Ho♦C/460-15/2.

Since my return from Bahrain I have been making enquiries about counterfeit conis and beg to report the following* Between the year 1925-32 a certain Mohsnalal Mitha was the agent of Messrs* Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited in Dubai. He was also working as a merchant and pearl trader. About the year 1930-31 Mohanlal Mitha brought three professional Indian smiths. They landed at Hanjam and from there proceeded by sailing craft to Has al Khamiah. Mohanlal Mitha owned a date garden at Ras al Khaimah in which he made them to live. Mohanlal Mitha started supplying them with silver and they began coining Government of India silver rupees. According to the most reliable information obtained, they coined about one hundred thousand rupees. For certain reasons which I have not been able to discover. Mohanlal Mitha sent back the three Indian smiths by the same route from which they came. Since that date counterfeit coins appeared on the Trucial Coast and were In circulation. The action of Mohanlal Mitha became known and some of the local people began to learn the art of counterfeiting colns*None of the local people,however, was skill enough to make good rupees which could not be detected. They used, to make moulds of sand or powdered china with syrup of &gt; h dates. As these rupees fleated in the market merchants began to % complain and the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai notified their k *iw r w subjects that persons found guilty of counterfeiting coins would be severely punished. Since then the local people ceased coining rupees./rupees* As the local people were not skilled for counterfeiting coins they used to s ell the coins for melting below face value* I have also been informed that a certain Persian known as Saiyid al Hakim was responsible for counterfeiting coins at Qatar and the Shaikh deported him about the year 1934-35* &amp;e came to Dubai where he stayed for about three months and then disappear ed from the Crucial Coast and did not return again* Some of the money which come from Qatar still contain counterfeit coins* Following are the names of the local people who were suspected of counterfeiting coins on the Truci&amp;l Coast*- SHARJAK . (1) *Ubeid bin Salih bin Hauman* He was a petty trader* He is now living at Falaj al Qabail where he inherited property from his late brother in law the late Kasir ar-Rubai* i* Falaj al Qabail is at Batinah. Nothing is known against him now. (2) Salim bin Sultan al Kamur* He is a well to do person and owns a pearl Sambuk* His yearly income is between Hg.5000/- and Hs•10000/- In winter he goes to Has al Khaimah with his slave wife and spend the whole winter fishing. Nothing is known against him now* DUBAI * (1) Ibrahim bin Fardan al Bahrani* He is a subject of Dubai and pearl merchant* He became insolvent about the year 1928* T hen he became bankrupt he started eoifuiterfeiting coins between the year 1928-30* He has six wives two of them being kept ones (MuVah) One of his wives n^med A&amp;ha Bibif a Persian from r horasan (Persia) She had no children and Ibrahim used to work secretly in her room without letting the rest of his wives know.. He is now a petty merchant and pearl broker* fhere is nothing ©gainst him now. (2) Hamdan Abu Bubis al Bahrani. He is a smith by profession and still works as such. There is nothing against him now* (3) Sa*id bin 1 Abdur Rahman of the Ban! Yas at Daira. He is brother in law of Saiyid Ibrahim of Hidd f Bahrain. I have been trying by various means to get a direct evidence against him* ■4 namely/namely f to get one who either saw him working or received from him counterfeit coins for himself or disposal but has not yet been successful* 3* Mohanlal Mitha left for India about the year 1932 and nothing is known hex*© about his whereabouts* I have not also been able to get the names of the three Indians whom he brought from India for counterfeiting coins* Sd.
