The Secretary of State in ,ub.e,„e rt dlscua5im said that h© had bsen much iirmrocscsa^j lyt^ ? / wi rnpress9d by the Resident's arganentsO^fen^TeTTOrthe case for the provision of a despatch vessel was a very strong one; that at the same time he felt some reluctance, both on principle and at the present juncture, to press the Government of India to finance even a small additional expenditure; that the possibility of employing the new ship which was being built to replace the R.I.K.S, Baluchi' for this purpose (allowing her to be used as a jM training ship in the Persian Gulf, but always at the beck and call of the Resident) might be explored; and that, failing ,his, were we satisfied that the 'Patrick Stewart' of 1500 tons was not rather large, and that no cheaper alternative of smaller size was available? Mr. Benn was reluctant to send a but intimated his willingness that, in the light of consideration of the points raised by him, a letter should go t the Government of India on the lines of the draft now attached putting the case to them. I am not quite clear whether the Secretary of State intended that this should be a letter, to be signed by himself, to the Viceroy, or a letter from the department to the foreign Secretary, but I attach afrteuPfmfciHju- drai tiik* Jjr ^ , uffiA. ^ (*. ^ As regards the two points raised by the Secretary of State, the Department feels (and the Military Department agree) that strong opposition might probably be expected from ^ le . to any proposal to make one of the fleet (and perhaps particularly a training ship) available for the Resident’s purposes. Difficulty, too, might arise in connection with the Persian Gulf climate, while the ship would be/be detac MllVpfvJ while sh Resident which we St ewart * behind u point of difficult Segrave t sa five year bargain - higher ru special si made in t] smaller b' could ha Departme along th' IMjV be detached from the remainder of the R.I.M. fleet and could hardly engage in fleet exercises. On the whole the Department doubts if any real advance would be possible along these lines. On the question of the size of the 'Patrick Stewart while she is admittedly rather on the large side, the Resident has already made reference to 'rough weather, of which we have a great deal in the Gulf. Even the 'Patrick Stewart' could make no progress and had to shelter three days behind islands. A smaller ship would be worse from the point of view of seaworthiness . . . '. 'Apart from possible difficulties of this nature, we are advised by Sir T. Segrave thatj.f we could get the 'Patrick Stewart' at-wean ^ aluo ^ sa y or-er4-ittlo morft\ (she costT£75,000 only ^ive years ago), we should probably be securing a better bargain - even when allowance had been made for the rather higher running costs involved - than if we were to build a special ship. And it is probable, in the light of enquiries made in the past, that the purchase and adaptation of a smaller but suitable vessel would also prove costly. f. yt,5155 5000 2/31 of/ Draft Paper. Department r I had an interesting conversation with the Resident in the Persian G-ulf, who arrived cn leave last week. We discussed most of the outstanding questions and I was Impressed by his grasp of his subject and his general keenness. He emphasised the objections to the removal of the Bushire Residency to Bahrein. This is a question which is, I fear, for practical purposes now almost chose iugee . But it is possible that the breakdown of the Persian negotiations may make some difference to the position, and at any rate it seems likely that we shall have to mark time for the present. On the question of the civil air route along the Arab ccast of the Gulf (which Irwin had already mentioned to me), I find myself inclined entirely to agree with the Resident's view as to the political objections to forcing the pace. Here again, however, much must depend on the prospectsHem of getting exte nBio n^ ^ from the Persians of our present^ line “ raised by Biscoe did impress me greatly, and I shoulfi like to ask for your sympathetic consideration of it - that is, the question of the purchase of the 'Patrick Stewart' as a despatch vessel. I was, of course, generally familiar with ^position I regarding it. But afteneroa#- the Resident I do feel strongly that it is very desirable , i he is to run his charge properly, that he should not be wholly dependent on the sloops, and that he should have some means of his own of getting about He emphasised the importance ox the personal equation in a place such as the Gulf, and the fact that the Resident's influence must to a large extent depend on his mobility ark on personal acquaintance with the various Sheikhs, etc.^I understand that the Government of Indi are at present investigating the probable working costs of the 'Patrick Stewart', but that her adaptation would be likely to involve an increase in the travelling expenses of the Resident.

Colonel Biscoe is strongly opposed to any move and considers that it would have an unfortunate effect on the Resident's prestige. This is an argument the force of which it is impossible for us to assess, but one at any rate of his predecessors was not inclined to attach much importance to it • either the India Office nor the Government of India have ever been very favourable to the removal of the Residency from Bushire, but they have given way in deference to strong pressure from the Foreign Office and the other Imperial departments concerned. T 7hile sympathising with Colonel 3iscoe’s desire to remain at Bushire, this Office is however inclined to think that there is force in the argument that his position could easily be made impossible there if tne Persians so desire. If this is the case, and if we cannot rely on diplanatic action to prevent it, there is probably much to be said for evacuating Bushire with dignity at some convenient time and establishing ourselves at Bahrein, — •'x. where we shall be free from interference, and where the Sheikh is willing to receive the Resident.

V ( 0 ) The Arab Air Route. Imperial Airways concession from the Persian Government, under which they fly to India along the Persian littoral of the Sulf expires in April 1932. The prospect of any renewal by tne Persian Government is at the marnent bad. The Persians have suggested an alternative route through Central Persia to which there are apparently practical objections but which is being investigated by Imperial Airways. tne Arab side of the Gulf we have, with considerable difficulty, and largely thanks to action taken by the present Resident, been able to establish the basis of a skeleton air This has been done only at the risk of serious incidents in the Trucial area, and at the cost of interfering u0 a greater or less extent with the rights of the small local Sheikhs. The position is further complicated by the fact that ''“le f ie Sheikhs are apparently prepared to acquiesce in flights by militar y aeroplanes, they are strongly opposed to a °ivil air route, with the ground organisation, etc. , which it vr ould involve. In these circumstances the Government of India k° Ve keen disposed to go very slow, a policy with which the ndia Offi ce are j_ n agreement. If, however, as is possible, the/ T 3389 34f J 1^17 T the Persians prove entirelv nr&gt;« f •, ■ t . y Unocm ^®i3i„ g about the grant of acx H ies on the Persian Xittorai, it fflay be neeeg3ary ^ c in the immediate future the political objections to a clV ^ a ^ r rou t e on the Arab r , nna+ .oast, and with this in view the Foreign Office have in the 1oo+ - , i- -he last few days been exploring the possibility of such a route with r route with Imperial Airways.

The case was not well handled subsequently, and as a result we are now faced with a situation in which | Iraq repudiates this liability.

H.M.G., although advised by the Law Officers ^ f of the Crown that they would have a good chance if the case : $89 ^ went to the Hague Court, are reluctant to do so in view of the risk that an award might go against them, and of the fact that the India Office and the Government of India have not been prepared to accept any contingent liability in this event. 1 Efforts to settle the matter by direct negotiation between the Sheikhs and Iraq have failed, and the suggestion has now been I ide that Iraq should reduce the assessment by a third, that the/me thS t&gt;dldnCe ° f the asse38me nt should be capital' b ° Ueht ° Ut ’ ^ C ° St bein ^ shared 50/50 betweenTd ^ the Hone Government. ndla and , Th6 ' f ° r any 00ntribu tion from l n d ia is exoe .. , weak, and the Government of India have expre y • . expressed the view 1 thi±ln n ° 01rcum stances could 'a moietv of • &gt; - ^ capitalised value | aSSeSSment ° f S&amp;rdenS be chargeable to Indian revenues'. ^ir recommendations are under ex*^ and a submission will shortly ,, made Qn ^ (e) Mu 3 cat.

He might, however, care to discuss with Colonel Biscoe the present position in the State with particular reference to the capacity of the Heir Apparent to take over fron the present Sultan (who has again renewed his demand to be allowed to abdicate) and the financial condition of the State (which is serious owing to droughts, falling off of overseas markets for dates, etc., and absence of effective control by the Central Government rtain ports wnich might otherwise produce customs duties).

My dear Howell, ^ During ^ recent visit to Delhi I pi iced on record on ♦: e file my views regarding the desirability of the pur- cW of the 'Patrick Stewart' as a despatch vessel for the Political Resident* 1 was under the impression when I wrote ny note that the necessity for providing the Resident with a despatch vessel had been admitted by the Government of India, but I gathered from my subsequent conversations with you that this was not altogether the case, and I should like there- f0re t0 amplify now the ^ews previously expressed in ny note which dealt solely with the desirability of purchasing the '•‘■atrick Stewart' in preference to another vessel. As you are aware, up tc 31st December 1926 the H.u..M.3• '*Lawrence ,f was utilised as a despatch vessel by the ioli 4 ical Resident , and during Sir Percy Cox’s tenure of tne pest he was constantly moving about the Gulf, and it ’■'• o largely by this means that he established his great influence in the Gulf, and has left behind him a name which is Known practically to every Arab in the Gulf. After the WRl * M Lawrence ,f combined the duties of a lighthouse tender with those of a despatch vessel and, as pointed out -n my note, this arrangement proved, in practice, to be ’unworkable. ... 811 s ecretary ^ 'o u he Government °f India, si&amp;a. 3389 1 MSSel Was seldom available when the Political. Resident required her, and it was found that ' hSn thS Inchc ^ e committee investigated the matter the Resident had not been able to use the 'Lawrence' for about a year. 1 .have no hesitation i„ that •he fac&lt; that the Resident was unable to tour resulted in an enormous diminution in hi s influence in the Gulf and ^ in the value of the advice that he was able to tender to the Government of India. Barrett reported that the • l las' Resident whose name was known to the Arabs on the frucial coast was that of 'Cokkus'. While it might perhaps be sr £ u ed that this was in some measure due to' *r. exceptionally powerful personality, I do not think thu-t this is a wholly adequate explanation,but rather © it is due to -the fact that Cox was to the Arafc Shaikhs livir: to entity, whom they knew personally and who knew tnem personally, whereas till recently ^sr has been to them a vague figure whom they seldom if ever saw, and who dealt with them solely through his local Politic-1 C ‘ LxC; -- s, and in the case of the Trucial coast, through the Residency /gent. I was in the Persian Gulf when Cox was Resident. I teturned here 18 months ago as Resident myself, and the first thing- that struck me was the absolute necessity for re-establishing the personal relations with the Arabs on the Arabian littoral that existed formerly. I was fortunate in my endeavours to do so, since my arrival coincided with the arrangement by which the 'Patrick Stewart' was placed at the disposal of the Political Resident for a considerable portion of the year, and I think I can reasonably claim by means of-3- this ship to have re-establiqhpd in lsneci , ln some measure at any ra'e, the personal relations that formerly subsists between the Hesidency and the Arabs and to have acquired a personal knowledge of the Gulf, which I hope has proved of some service to the Government of India and to His Majesty’n Government, and which it would have been quite impossible -or me to have acquired otherwise. A typical example of this is 3ur. I tendered certain advice to the Government of irr.'xa f or ..e re-establishment of the authority of the Muscat State at Sur based on reports received from local officers, .since I had not then an opportunity of visiting the place, and the advice which I gave was wrong, and had it been acted upon, there might have been, I now realise, unfortunate rep ere us ei - ro • After discussion with you it was decided ■M'at I should proceed to Sur myself, as soon as possible, and when I did so, I was enabled to effect a settlement of the matter on totally different lines. This shows how absolutely essential it is that the Resident should have personal knowledge of the peoples and trioes with whom he is called on to a eal, and I could quite several other instances where a personal visit and personal discussion have enabled me to effect settlements which would otherwise have been very difficult to bring about. A portion of the Gulf which as you know is some what in the lime-light at the present day is the Trucial coast, owing to the opening of the air route and various Questions are also arising regarding the ownership cu tue islands in the - Persian Gulf in connection with the rers^an negotiations. On the Trucial coast, the Government cu -nli 8 * maintains a Residency Agent whose work, as you ai‘e awai e,£MI7 •'f’ eiitj jn i «; s ' SflJ - o Sgt 3lW0fI3i j od - 9 0i\VE • 1 o J sm 'o': .'ii/8 ni oirf.t rti iQ't aihnl I£j8 j t.i i v b .* $ tit bn.e ^naAt ?

None ° f these questions can be suitably dealt with through j: j iMp.UK-Uy.-. iy^ local Arab agent, though for lack of means of transport I have been compelled to delege.te some of them to him since the 'Patrick Stewart' left. If the Resident is not provided with a despatch vessel, then he must perforce lose contact with the Arab coast, for the only remaining means of transport at his disposal are of little practical value except in emergencies. The ordinary mil service is of little use; the fast mail does not touch the Arab coast; the slow mail is exceedingly irregular and is a cargo service. Steamers are sometimes two or three days late and sometimes early. By slow mail the Political Resident can of course visit Kuwait, and if fc* f l nWv *4 15 ^ 1 &gt;U fi* ' v i w ’ *n rwi vv T|- the steamers adhere to their dates, he can occasionally visit Bahrain to which there is a fortnightly service. $ trip to Muscat and back would take over three weeks, could riot visxt the fractal coast, Q.atar, or any oi tue islands in the Gulf or such places as Sur, 3ohar, cue.
