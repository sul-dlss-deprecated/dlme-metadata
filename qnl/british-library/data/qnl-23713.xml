TRIVEDI, E sq ., O.B.E., Deputy Secretary to the Oovernment of India, 10 att LOCAL GOVERNMENTS and ADMINISTRATIONS and CENTRAL SERVICE ASSOCIATIONS. New Delhi, the 1st March 1934, S ubject.— Creation of sterling branches of provident funds. sir 't am directed to refer to the Home Department letter No. f. 387/30- Rsts dated the 5th December 1932, and subsequent correspondence, 0 !! lists., aateu J „ r „ at i on 0 f sterling branches of provident funds with a ' ^ of officels in P r0 \ ident ^ % 1 . , f„ii ; n tlie exchange value of the rupee. The scheme has recerved of the great malority of local Governments and Administrations and Service Associations, and the Secretary of State has sanctioned its in troduction with effect from the 1st April 1934. 2. The details of the scheme finally approved are as follows (a) Provident fund deposits will continue to be kept m India, u ( ) the accounts of officers admitted to the sterling branch wiU be maintained in sterling, as well as m rupees. Steps are being taken to ensure that the deposits in the sterlin 0 will not be liable to British Income-tax when taken to the United Kingdom by officers at the time of retirement. The scheme will embrace all provident funds to which officers ^ (b) 1 u „der ' he control of the Secretary of State or Governments in India subscribe, including the Contributory Provident Fimd (India), the Indian Ordnance Department Provident Fund and the Indian Army and Royal Indian Marine Officei Provident Fund. (c) The following classes of officers in service on the 1st April will be entitled to join the sterling branch (0 Officers who are or at any time have been eligible for overseas pay, whether of Asiatic or non-Asiatic domicile, and whether recruited in India or not ; (ii) members of a Police service of non-Asiatic domicile under the rule-making control of Governments m India; (iii) subordinates of non-Asiatic domicile serving on the railways ; (iv) members of the London staff of Company-managed Rail- ways. Id\ The Government of India or a local Government, as the case may be mav, at their discretion, extend the concession of joining the sterling branch to Government servants of non-Asiatic domicile in service on the 1st April 1934, whether recruited in India or not, who are not eligible for overseas pay and arenot entitled to join that branch under clause (c). This dis cretion will be exercised in the cases of Government servants of non-Asiatic domicile who are likely to retire outside a rupee- using country. (e) Persons recruited to the Services after the 1st April 1934 will be eligible to join the sterling branch only if they are of non- Asiatic domicile at the date of appointment and are recruited outside India. (/) Officers in service on the 1st April 1934 who are eligible to join, and are desirous of joining, the sterling branch must elect to do so within six months after that date, or, if they are on leave on that date, within six months after their return from leave. Persons recruited to the Services after the 1st April 1934 will be required to exercise the option within 30 days of joining their appointment. The option once exercised will be final in the case of all officers. (g) The domicile of an officer for the purpose of admission to the sterling branch will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the rules in Appendix B to Schedule IV of the Superior Civil Services Rules except that proviso (6) to rule 10 of those rules will be disregarded. {h) The amount standing to the credit of an officer, including sub scriptions, Government contributions, if any, and interest thereon, on the 1st April 1934 will be converted into sterling at the statutory rate of 15. Qd to the rupee and credited to the sterling branch. Subscriptions and Government contributions, if any, in respect of the period subsequent to that date will be credited in the sterling account at the rate of exchange current at the time of credit calculated to the nearest half-penny. No subsequent rise or fall in the exchange value of the rupee will affect the sterling value of sums credited to the sterling branch. (i) Interest on balances in sterling accounts will be calculated in sterling at the same rate as that prescribed by the Government of India from time to time in respect of deposits in the General Provident Fund and other similar funds. (j) Members of the sterling branch who are eligible for the grant of temporary advances under the ordinary rules of the fund to which they subscribe, will continue to be eligible for the grant of such advances from the sterling branch. {k) Members of the sterling branch who, under the ordinary rules of the fund to which they subscribe, are entitled to use their deposits to effect a policy of life insurance will retain that right. (1) Advances and withdrawals under clauses (j) and (A;) will be paid in sterling in the United Kingdom but if payment is desired in India, the sterling amounts will be converted into rupees at the then current rate of exchange calculated to the nearest half-peny. (m) When the sums standing to the credit of members in the sterling branch finally become payable, actual payment in sterling in the United Kingdom will be made only to those members who satisfy Government of their intention to reside, after retirement, outside a rupee-using country. It is not intended to prescribe any tests for this purpose and the decision will rest with the Government concerned. In the case of those members who fail to satisfy Government of their intention to reside, after retirement, in a country where the rupee is not legal tender, payment will be made in rupees in India of the sums standing to their credit in their rupee account.■' 3 (n) The scheme will be applied to railway gratuities and the bonus due under rule 19 of the State Railway Provident Fund Rules ; but the exact details of the arrangements necessary in this connection are being worked out by the Government of India in consultation with the Secretary of State. 3. The Government of India propose to issue a set of self-contained rules to give effect to the decisions announced above. Copies of the rules as drafted will be forwarded to provincial Governments to enable them to frame similar rules for Government servants and provident funds under their control. (Any loss that might be caused by the payment of provident fund deposits in sterling will be borne by the Central Government. If, however, with the introduction of the new constitution there is a separation of finances as regards loan and deposit heads, the loss, if any, in future will be borne by provincial Governments.) (4. I am to request that the details of the scheme may be communicated to all officers concerned and to Provincial Services Associations interested in the matter. Spare copes of this letter are being enclosed for this purpose). I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. M. TRIVEDI, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.
