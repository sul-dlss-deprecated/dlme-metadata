Date Report for the month of October, 1934, on the political situation in Trans-Jordan, by the British Resident, Amman. (A copy of this report has also been sent to Hia Majesty’s Charg$ d'Affaires, Jeddah).\ /dtu/' y * y REPORT ON THE / //. «&gt;y POLITICAL S IT U A T I Q N for the month of OCTOBER, 1934. Another unsuccessful agricultural year J! 1 • with its consequent fall in revenue has made it necessary to cut approved expenditure to the tune of some £?;10 , 000 . Having Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Nejd on her borders Trans-Jordan cannot add to her revenue by raising her Customs duties, for to do so would attract smugglers whose activities she could not control. Neither can she gain anything from the fact that her territory lies across the route from Palestine to the East, for to charge transit dues might divert trade or oil to the Syrian route and be detrimental to the interests of the port of Haifa or Jaffa. The country is no uoubt fdrtunate in having such modern conveniences as a Legislative Council with an elected majority* an Audit and an Antiquity Department and Public Security Forces in Doth desert and settled areas which restrain and protect the people in a fit and proper manner and not by Allying} but with all this and a falling Grant-in- ^ adequate provision for development is out of the Ration. All that can be done is barely to maintain /3. The sentence of / maintain the services which it has so far been possible to build up 0 In one direction this lack of money is about to prouuce a crisis. Tne excavations which have been carried out have produced a considerable amount of materia 1 which must be classified, divided, and stored and which should of course be properly displayed. With its financial resources Trans- joraan is quite incapable of attending to any part of the museum side of its obligations ana unless an arrangement can be made whereby Trahs-Jordan t s antiquity objects are taken on loan and displayed in the lb lestine Museum, it will be necessary to prevent any further excavations here. 2° The Legislative Council elections were ccmpleted about the 20 th and all thesuccessful candidates are those who enjoyed Government support. Many of those who hoped but failed to gain a seat have joined forces against the Government whom they accuse of rigging the elections in an entirely unscrupulous manner. To what degree this 1&amp;: ^ rue 1 am not in a position to say but there is no o ouot that the Government exercised its influence ln persons acceptable to it elected* The w hole business is corrupt and votes are bought and s °ld quite openly. a number of the disappointed ? er sons referred to above h^ve ccme to Amman to discuss ig ir line of action and will probably be sent off t^eir homes in a few days time.3. The sentence of HUS33113 PASHA TARAWEH which was referred to in paragraph 1 of the Heport for September was reduced on appeal to one month but a petition that tne imprisonment be commutted to a fine was refused. Notification of Judgment was withheld till the elections were concluded and HUSSEIN PASKA is now serving his sentence,, 4° Aniir has as recently as yesterday re-affirmed his promise that he intends to give TAUFIQ, A3Ui 11010/1 an appointment though not in the Agricultural Baik. TAUFIQ, BaY, in the meantime, is approaching the end of his patience and of his resources. 5 ‘ 1)10 further news has come to me in regard to the Amir's lana ig the Ghor el Kibd. 6 The Amir Shaker has entered into effective possession of his land in the Ghor el Safi (vide p 3 ragrapk 6 of September Report), He is going into partnership with SHUKRI EL LEM a weli-t 9 -do Christian rchant of Jerusalem who will provide the capital Sc^ry for the development of the land, Shukri owns d nuiriD er of boats on the Dead Sea, 7 t HAJ NIMR hABULSI is considering buying &gt;000 aunoums of land just north of the Zerka and lying of* fv, _ mam road to Jerash and the north.

F BRITISH RESIDENT.If AIR MAIL ' j ' J *+ O i I '■'I , i C&gt; 4 I Downing Street, 1 Novembar, 19i&gt;4. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the report on the political situation In Trans-Jordan for the naonth of October, 1934, copies of vhich were enclosed in Mr. Hall's secret despatch of the 6th of November. 2. in section 1 of the report, the British Kesident suggests that the control exercised by His majesty's Government over the finances of Trans-Jordan preclu es any adequate provision being made for development in that country. This suggestion is somewhat misleading. While it may ho true to say that there is no immediate prospect of providing for development schemes In the budgetary exDendlture of the Trans-Jordan Government, there Is another source from which assistance may be, end has in fact been, obtained for this purpose. I refer to the Colonial Development Fund. As you are aware, grants have already been approved from the Colonial Development Fund for the establishment of experimental water boring stations and towards the improvement of the road between £s Salt and the Allenby Bridge, and it has been mede clear on several occasions that the colonial Office K.C.B. , , D.S.O. , willwill support suitable applications to the Colonial Development Advisory Consnittee for assistance from the Fund submitted by the Trans-Jordan Government. 4. The reconraendatlons of the Economic Committee appointed towards the end of last year to study the possibility of developing the resources of Trans-Jordan have not yet been made known to me, but I trust that as a result of that Conmittee's delibera tions, it will be found possible to submit proposals for development in Trans-Jordan in a form which will be acceptable to the Colonial Development Advisory Committee. some indication of the type of scheme which may be submitted to the Committee with a reasonable hope of success is given in letters which were sent to you from the Colonial office on the 28th February, 1933, and the 14th August, 1934. 5. i shall be obliged if the British Resident at Aiaaan may be reminded of the position in this respect. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant. f ounl,f ?z-uste r* / V JL. 12b Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following nupiber quoted h j - ?0 I !

Mention was mad^ in paragraph 7 of the Report for August that Elias Gelat and his associates are considering leasing the Amir’s land in the Ghor el ICibid. The Amir has stated that the original option on this land which was given to two Jews for 6 months in January, 19 33, has been twice renewed for similar periods of 6 months; Ur* Shertock o f the Jewish A^-tncy, however, states that tne rc has been a subsequent renewal of one year* The Amir has also stated tnat when he saw Dr. Weizmann in England tru Doctor assured him tnat all arrangement s in regard to the land would be cancelled should the Amir desire it on condition that the Amir repays the £?2l,000 which has be^n advanced to him* The Amir hss asked that £?t 1,000 may be advanced to him by the Government for this purpose.

The progress of land settlement in the North and the security obtained by registration of titles ther^ftor, together with tne vio.xts m°de from cultivation in the South during the last wo ye,-^ have taught the Bedu that some more definite rr-ngoment in regard to this land is necessary and have 111 ‘de them afraid of the claims of tte l r a * a n i s to a share of 1 nds ^hich they have put under cultivation in partnership with the Beau.

During the Amir t s absence in England Talal’s mother took the opportunity of cancelling Talal^s engagement to the daughter of Sherif Ali Haidar, referred to in paragraph 15 of the Report for June and arranged his engagement to the daughter of her brother Sherif Jemil Ibn Nasser. I The Amir was not pleased, on his return, to find that this haa been a one , but accepted the fait accompli , and gave the formal engagement, which took place on the 2 nd of August, his blessing; tne marriage is to take place early in October. On the 1st. of August, the Amir and a number of prominent people were the guests of the Group Captain Commanding and the Officers of the Royal Air Porce, Amman, at a dinner party which was followed by a private c inema/jrSSJg'Cftiiww* Amongst the guests invited to the cinema w tre the two Amiras and a number of other ladies. The entertainment was much appreciated. On the 4th August, His Excellency the nigh Commissioner joined the Amir in the camp which His nighness bad set up at El * Al, between I'adeba and Amman. s Beduin parade was arrange.^ for the following morning and His /- *2 - % and His Excellency sffcor driving to verious places in the neighbourhood, returned to Jerusalem, by air, after lunch on the 6 th* 4 , In the absence on leave of Colonel de Vic, the Governor of the Jebel Druze, Colonel Herson, who is acting in his plaoe , accompanied by his wife, Capitaine Gandouly, and Lieutenant Leneveu from Deraa were tne guests of the British Resident on the 7th and 8 th* 5.

He and the Amir lunched with His excellency the High Commissioner in Jerusalem on their way through. SALS IBA 3S-SLEIH3ET , vide paragraph 13 of the Report for July, paragraph 6 of that for June, and paragraph 2 of that for Fay, has petitioned to the Amir to assist him to acquire from the Government the 10,000 dunoums of lana in the Ghor el Nimreen* The Amir (for a consideration it is alleged) has passed the petition to the Government with a favourable minute. Enquiries show that SLEIHEET i s in as sociation with Jews in this case and that his intention merely to make money by subsequently transferring the land to Jews; in the ci rc instances, the Government 0 n °t intend to sanction the transaction. 7. ELIAS GSLAT /7 ^L-IAS G^LAT ana hie ac eo-c ia m .-n t ianed in paragraph 14 of the Report for July, were after all allowed to register as a company without any amendment to their Articles of Association being insisted upon. This Company have entered into negotiations with the Amir in re^rd to leasing the Ghor el Xibid for which it will be remembered His Highness granted an option some months a go to a Jewish concern. From this it would appear that the Amir has been able to withdraw from the option though in what manner tnis was arranged I am at present unaware, Tne negotiations for lease have no$ yet be t n terminated. 6 . It is reported that the Jews are negotiating for the acquisition from the Persian Bahaas of tne lands ana village of Adessieh, just south of the Yarmuk. 5. During his recant tour in the South of Trans-Jordan the Amir was impressed by the desirability of an area of land near DQ3AK between Ane iza Station £nd Shobek. His ^ighness, however* has hitherto shewn himself sc little capable of making proper use of his estate that any a a oil ion thereto seems undesirable# • The rutessarrif of the Belqa , 3 a 1-IH ricJAZIi tfhosc reduction to Kaimakam was referred to in paragraph ii o: tne Report for July, has resigned as a protest ^e^inst his treatment and in tix firm belief that he will sooner or later bu re-appointed to the Government Service.

Both Samih Hejazi and passim Kindav/i GS sured me that thuir feelings towards tne Mandatory Wer -rc of the most friendly and that they are fully a WGre that the country cannot stand without Her help guidance. In my opinion, the present Chief Minister ls the best the country has had, he has no political ^ r ^juai Cv-B&lt; s i nce graduating from College he has bev.n th^ servi ce 0 p Government and his legal training °f the greatest help to him; he is tolerant of •^gions other than his own and is anxious to help in any reform /rj]y reform where possihle# 1/is takes m-y have be&gt;-n made in allowing the appointment of persons who -re not Trans •Joraanians bom hut the supply of educated ana suitable Trans- joruanians is lamentably small, 11 . Very soon after its appointment the present Government were persuaded to cagree to t_.e re- founation of the Funicipal Advisory Board which w^s done away with some years ago. The President of this Board is the director of Public Health, Dr. Halim Abu Rahneh, to whose energy most of the reforms now being brought ^bout arc due, ICunicip-l scavenging in all the it now m charge of the Government Medical Officer who is- member of the Municipal GouncilJ considerable progress has be^n mad- in the drafting of the new Municipal Law and the Chief Minister is prepared to agrov, that i-unicip- 1 accounts shall be subjected to tno scrutiny of the Department of Audit, provided tne reports of the Chief Dxaminct are furnished to tne Chi^f Minister r lone . This proposal is undw r examination and has be-n strongly r e comm ended for acceptance , for although it does not put the Municipal accounts , for audit purposes* the same level as the accounts of the Government control will, n0 no the less, be satisfactory and vastly better than no audit at all. The primary elections, when secondary voters will be chosen who will elect the members 01 W Legislative Council, are to take place about ^ midale of Septanber.13. difficulty }x^-s l?Cv.n -experienced in that the Mir has no power under the Organic Law to legislate, whin the Legislative Council is unwilling to ao so, so as to fulfil his international obligations ana thus fulfil his undertaking given in the Agruement of 1928. At present ''ll he can do is, with the Executive Oouncil, to pass ordinances if necessity shouldarise , when the Legislative Council is not sitting, for urgent measures to be taken for the maintenance of public order and security, or for repelling a public danger or for urgent expendi ture not sanctioned by the Budget or by special law, or for the purpose of fulfilling his treaty obligations. The Chief Minister h^s expressed the opinion that the following modification to the above provision of Article 41 of the Organic Law which has been forwarded for His Excellency the High Commissioner’s consideration shoula prove acceptable to the Legislative Council j- 'If need should arise when the Legislative Council is not sitting to pass any enactment whi ch the Legislative Council, if sitting, might pass the Amir in Council may pass ordinances directing the necessary measures to be taken.” Such an amendment would not, of course, the Amir the full power it is desirable that he should ii r °Y to enable him to secure the fulfilment of his treaty §-tions , but would at any rate be a very considerable ce from the present position ana in all probability suffi 0 i e , c to enable all necessary legislation to be ens cted. A further difficulty /A furtii^r difficulty lf ?,0 btjvu tiiTit Article 25 of tnc Organic Law has be«.n tck fcn to moan tirt every logisla tive c nactment of any nature whatsoever must be submitted to the Legislative Council, Thi - means that a multitude of topics» many of a trifling nature, representing all the various departments of Government activity must, in the absence of delegated powers, be submitted to the Legislative Council and, if the council refuses to pass the same or if it is not sitting and the matter is not one of urgency the Government is powerless to t act. A L^-w has b^^n drafted and forwarded to the High Commissioner for approval which provides that the Legislative Council shall have exclusive jurisdiction to p-ss laws governing certain matters ana providing tnat thu Amir in i^x^cutive Council shall have power at any time to pass any enactments, to b^ known cas Administrative Regulations , other than those within the xclusive jurisdiction of the Legislative Council described, rnd c 0nQe rn ing any administrative matters within the juriodiction of the Government or any Department thereof# The first Legislative Coftncil was so jealous of its power *nd found it so hard to believe ^ t it really had that power, that it was even unwilling to ^legate authority to the Government in the laws P-Sted to make regulations* Experience, however, given the Councillors a more liberal view and the e Minister considers that the Council will pass tHis Law, 14.

The Law provides that the t-x assessed as payable by the vill-ge shall be distributed amongst the owners by c f^.x Distribution Committee composed of the 1 ukhtars and Notables appointed by the Senior Administrative Official -nu acting under the supervision of an official| but that if this Committee fails to make the distribution within a period this shall be aone by the senior Administrative Official as appears to him best. The pe ople of Salt Kada, who are a quarrelsome .nd unreasonable lot, have failed to make the distribution* so he lists will be compiled by tne Kaimakam on the adequate informcition which the Department of Lands is in a Position to give him. Knowing the character of the people Government is imperturbed .^nd counts on making the distribution with success. id.

Hia Highness has returned in excellent spirits and is much impressed by the friendliness shewn him in -Jigland by the Public as well as by those with whoa he came in personal contact. He insists that the friendliness and autual adiiiration already existing between the English and tbe Arabs must be consolidated and that steps must be taken to inform public opinion of the true relations between and Jews which are not understood at all. His Highness a «y be expected to shew too keen an anxiety about Palestine f g affairs but apart from that his visit to England sesae to have done much good. His Hlgkmeaa's welcome in Trans-Jordan was very **** and it is fortunate that the very large body of torsemen who rode with him to Amman firing their rifles in the *ir suffered only one casualty. 4.4* On the 28 th f tha A«lr inritad soma 60 paopla from Gaza, Jaffa# Tulkaraa and Nablua to lunch with hi* in Aaaan and over 90 arrived to partake of his hospitality. On the 29th a large contingent fro* Hebron were Hie Highness*e guests. These parties are in return for the hospitality shewn to the Amir before hie departure for England, 6. The A*ir, apparently, came little in contact with Jews whilst in England and it la thought that he is much less favourable to their entry into Trans-Jordan than when he vent away, 6, During the Amir*a absence the Amir Talal has acted as Regent and has shewn common sense and moderation. He has, however, a bad habit of being late for his appointments and I have told him that punctuality is said to be the politeness of Princes, 7, The Amir Shaker has proved a broken reed to Talal in the Aair's absence, for he has supported those who are in opposition to the Government| hearing of this on his return the Amir wrote Shaker a letter, which he instructed the Chief Minister to shew me, couched in very friendly terms calling upon Shaker to cease befriending the Amir*© enemies and pointing out how very unfortunate it would be if the Mandatory Power were again to demand the cancellation of the Bedu Control Board aa they had done in 1994, It had been suggested that I should apeak a word of warning to Shaker, but I had already sent a message to hi* that would ^ot help hi* to obtain the land he wants, so long ss his exposition to the Government continues, and the Amir at once screed when l suggested that it would be better for me not to Intervene between hi* and his cousin.. Immediately on receipt of the letter. Shaker called on the Aair and assured k** of his loyalty and devotion. The A*ir would only exile Shaker fro* the country n face of very grave provocation, since he is his close relation, His Highness considers that even then he would hev* toto jaaice Shaker an allcrrancc ecfulvalent to the salary he nov draws froo the OoveiTOient as President of the Beds Control Board. 8# r. u. GJianimohp a professional agitator and assoeiate of the Kish el latiqlai, hawing refused to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour, was placed under police supervision. The decision as %o vdietlier or no lie shall be prosecuted for this was left for the Aair to decide on his return fro* nglaad. 9. I’i^nuaed el iohel&amp;ln, who was appointed by the Anlr last sunnier to the post of Hals el biwan (idxioh is the aoat iar)ortant post in the fair’s personal staff) after having proved unsuccessful as an Administrative officer and in the Education Department has been discharged by the \nlr as unsuitable on the reconmendation of the Fjcecutive Council. 10. These events have caused sane stir against the Government; an unsuccessful attempt has been made to persuade those of the Executive Council f who are no longer loyal to the Chief Minister, to resign and the latent hostility of Trans- Jordanians bora to those who were Syrians or Palestinians is being encouraged by the Opposition. Xn reaction to this the foreign officials have hastened to protest their loyalty to the Chief Minds ter. 3^* On the 88th the Mutesaarrif of the Belqa District, was degraded to the rank of Kkimakam and his post has been filled by promoting the Kainakan of Es Balt •* a Circassian. The new Land Tax Inw has been applied throu^out the country with the exception of the Ajlun Llwa; and the «3?peals which were lodged have been dealt with except in the kalt district. The large landowners and men of influence h * 7 ® *OJ*ked against this new system of taxation because they ** »o longer escape paying their Just share.In the Beni sakhr area, the Sheikhs refused to co-operate in distributing the tax assessed as due from the different areas and the distribution fell to be done by the lluteesarrif* In the Beni Hamida area, a nan eho attempted to persuade hie fellows to refuse payment was imprisoned# And in Salt a meeting of notables was called by the Chief Minister and the Financial Adviser to go into various questions In connection with the tax# !$# Before leaving for England the Amir leased a further 600 dunums of his land in the Jordan Valley to Saleeba ee~alelhlt (making 7D0 dunouas in &amp;ll)f for each area he received an advance of fP#S00 which is to be deducted from the last instalment of rent# It has been suggested that Sleihit in attempting to acquire the block of 10,000 dunouas in the Ohor ffimreen, which was referred to in the report for June, was merely looking for a high price in the future from the Jews who have an option from the Amir for the Ghor el Kibid to the north, and have paid £P#?00 to the Hlmir and Abbad sections of the Adman In regard to the lands at Ghor Raaeh and Ghor Ksffreln (presumably for an option) which lie to the south of the Ghor N imreen# 14# The Company, referred to In paragraph 7 of the June report, has been allowed to register on deleting from its articles of Association the clause concerning purchase, lease or exchange of land# IB# The money provided for relief works on account of last year's crop failures has been exhausted and authority to commence the new programme of relief has not yot been received# iTuabers of destitutes have distributed ^ Aerie elves over Tr&amp;na-Jordan and some four or five thousands haTe gone over to Palestine.16. The Offleler dea Renaeigneaente from Deraa lunched with the British Resident in 4aaan on th&lt; and July but was unable to remain for the nl&amp;it. 17. Ill© collection of duty by the Trans-Jordan Customs Department on foreign material, other than raw material, in goods manufactured in Syria has called forth a wery urgent protest from the Syrian / uthorlUes. Details hare been given to the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan and it has been suggested that the French be asked to say in what specific cases the terns of the Cue tome Agreement have been dishonoured. 18. A patrol of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force, which was engaged in remarking desert tracks, unwillingly crossed the frontier near Ifadltha. On seeing the Saudi poet the mistake was realised and an explanation was given and an apology wns offered on the spot. A telegram of explanation was also sent from Jerusalem to Jedda. (Signed) C.H.F.

Th® Supplementary Agreement will oa puolished as soon as possible after it has been laid before Parliament. 2 . The Ar-if left Jerusalem by tram on me 3rd. June and was seen off by a small crowd P At Kantara the ^yptian Government gave him a guard of honour and a special train to him to Port Said and from Farseilles the French Government gave him a special coach* Letters recuivt-d fi.cni England show that His Highness is pleased with hi reception and is enjoying himself. 3. Half an hour after His Highness's ^arture from Jerusalem ths Executive ^omnitoeo Trans-Jordon Gongress issued a proou.^-*^t ic&gt;n i^P y ^ that / ' £ 0 att.*at the Trans-*J^raan G-^v ernrnent Zionists to obtain a footing in Tr.^*.s-Joruan* Government thereupon orderea tne offices of tne Executive Committee (v^icn are tne same as those of Adil el Azmeh) to be inspected by the Attorney-Gen^ral when a copy of a letter to the late Kin 0 Paisal abusing the Amir was found • 4 . The publication in the Palestine newspapers JAFIA EL ARABIA and JAMIA EL I3LAMIA of a proclamation by the Arab Executive of Palestine g to the effect that tne Arabs of Palestine would not recognise any negotiations carried out by the Amir on behaif of Palestine, drew a telegram from the Executive Committee of the oruan Congress saying that they a Iso repudiated anything done by the Amir which mi^ht weaken tne stand in Trans-Jordan against Zionism, S' Tne newly published Paxestine P«per 'l-AJALLAT EL SHUB3AN rt was excluded from Trans-Jordan by ordefc of the Government for publishing a circumstantial account of a conversation alleged to have taken place between the Amir and the Hi 0 h Commissioner on the subject of Mission to Trans-Jordan of Jewso The Amir was shown £s bein w in favour of the project. Tn t 4 mir f s ^porters in Am^an compelled tne shop, at v*nich ^aper was being sold, to close. 6 . Political th. Joruan ^ s ^leiheet. Reference was mado in paragraph 2 of Re port for liny to the lease of 10*000 dunoums Valley by a section of tne Auwan to &amp;ALo» After further study of tne case the Government decided /3 the G^Vvrnm^nt decided trie iana in. q U *etion we** ^twat rt and caused Saleeba to be served with a notice on the 17th June, informing him of this anu re(juirin him to leave the land within 7 days. Saleeba has since appealed in A:^an and applied to the Government that they should lease the land to him direct# This request has been refused and it appears that Saleeba does not contemplate proceedings a gains t the Adwan with whom he made the contract of lease, A Company, c&amp;nposed mainly of Palestin ians, with a capital of £P*5,000, applied during the month for registration at the Ministry of Justice but, as one of its objects was the purchase, lease or exchange ot land, it was informed that the registration could not be permitted. The Associazione Nazionale Italiana ^hich, as mentioned in last month’s Report, has £P*16,000 to spend on hospitalization in Trans-Jordan, has obtain^ Permission from the Government to build its tnird hospital t Irbid, there being one already in Ainman ana a second In •? r ° CcS s oi construction in Kerak. The Association is fifldin^ difficulty in choosing a site in Irbid, as that Preferred cannot be granted to them being a declared antiquity site, 9. The Government has given permission ^ 0 tn- registration in the name of a nominee (a foreigner) Of i Vp V, • f ranciscans of the lands at Siaghah and MikhayiE* the Franciscans have been working for some time# It is being pointed out /It ia bein^. point.eb- J?^arLcan^ that this arrangement may noc solve their aifficulty because if the nominee (lies without heirs tue property will revert to tne Governmen t» 10. Txiere have been two baa assaults in Amman auring the month. Firstly, a Christian Magistrate and member of the Court of First Instance was beaten by a Damascene to whose friends the Judge had refused to grant bail. The man has been arrested but has not as yet been tried. Secondly, the Mayor of Antnan was assaulted by a Damascene merchant against whom proceedings had been taken to recover arrears of Municipal taxes. The inciaent nearly le&lt;a to a fight between the babuls is (the Mayor is from Nablus) and Damascene factions and numerous telegrams of protest were received from Palestine, The aggressor? who is the brother«*in-law of Hamid pasha el Wadi (of ibn Rafada fame), has been sentenced to a year’s imprisonment but the Government has appealed asking that the maximum sentence of two years be inflicted. Hamia Pasha, who is now in Damascus &gt; hack put forward a further request, v/hich has been refused, to be allowed to enter Trans-Joraan with the intention, probably, of trying to get his brother-in-law pardoned. On tne 34 th. / 11•* 5 ** 11* On the 24th* th 4 ; birtixiay the x^ophet waa celebrated and this year the precedent set up in 1933, of giving tne ceremony particular importance, was followed. During the proceedings outside the Mosque the Damascene Party tried to take precedence over the Uabulsi Party and their banner and a fight ensued during which several heads were broken. Political significance was at first attached to this a ffair and the Regent was anxious to place Abu Ghanimeh, the late Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Trans-Jordan Congress, in forced residence at Aqaba. Ke was, however, dissuaded from this. It is said that the origin of tne bad fe dmg between the Damascenes and Habulsie is not the attack on tne Mayor but is due to the fact that on tne complaint of Damascenes the Government has recently deported from Damascus a number of Nabulsi merchants who were trading there. Although the two sides have been reconciled the tinder is dry. l 2 o With reference to paragraph 12 of the Report for May, the Chief Minister informs me that on visiting Tafileh he called for the records of animal theft as he knew from previous experience that this crime was common there. To his surprise he found tnat no cases had / V/*n)6 y'-f (y no cases had occurred for months ana learned that this was attributed to one such accused having been placed in forced residence at A^a'oa. On visiting Ajlun later ana finding onat animal theft was prevalent tnere he advised the Magistrate to make similar use of the Pro visional Law for preventing the theft of animals. 13. The cumulative effect of crop failures in the north-eastern area of Trans jordan is serious and recommendations for obtaining funds for relief measures have been made to His Excellency the High Commissioner. The moment is opportune to improve the trans- desert road which from Mafrak westwards runs through the distressed area. The result of the general winter crop survey shows that the necessary remissions can be covereu from savings, excess of revenue above the estimates ana the provision already made . 14. Tru British Resident visited Suweida on the 5th of June and was the guest of Colonel de Vic, the recently appointed Governor of the Jebel Lruzo* THe Governor stated that conditions on the frontier could hardly be improved. It is of interest that a P re nob. Colonel whib visited Umm el Jemal on the 22na frcxii Bosra Eski Sham ask^d permission to a3 so before setting out. This place, it will oe remembered &gt; is north of the so called frontier7 du fait but south of the new frontier which latter doe s not come into force until the conclusion of the Bon Voisinaie Agreement« 15 0 The engagement of the A^ir Talal to the daughter of Sherif Ali Haidar, which was forecast in paragraph 6 of the H^ort for Hay* has been arranged* The Amir and Talal are both very pleased and the fomer has stated that it had been made a condition c o tne marriage by the lady's family that she snoula not be confined always to tne house, tnat she and Talal should have a noose of their own and that Talal should not take a second wife. The Amir Talal is doing quite well as Regent and is being kept budy by a series of visits to Government offices and a couple of dinner pgarties per week in the Palace which the Chief Minister has arranged for him. 3.7.34. BRITISH R4SID&amp;i&gt;iT.Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— Reference to previous Letter the Colonial Office of the I ransmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

His Highness has leased his lands in tne ZCR, near the Ailenby Bridge, to a Bethlehem Christian named SAI3 j£ 3A j£S SLhIHSBT who is sc ting for two Jews named HAS 3 ID OS and YASHAR. The same person has leased for 99 years an area of some 10»000 dunoums, which lies in the Jordan valley to the South of the Ailenby Bridge road and near the river. SALEYBA in this case is said to be acting for the Jewish National Fund. The persons who have leased ibis 3ana are the Salih Section of the Adwan tribe who have for several years been supported by tne Amir in opposition to their paramount Sheikh, Sultan el Aawan. The Government are perturbed by this lease of lanu to and believing that a part of the area concerned WaB ^-SWAT land were considering warning SAXaiABA that had entered into a contract with people who had no r ieht to make it. It transpires, however, that the lessor /- 2 l^seor title *hich i 6 stra n ^ torn*** such action una^sirable. I have reminaea the Government that the Amir has given a promise to tne High Commissioner tna t he will allow no settlers into Trans-Joruan until tne High Commissioner has assurea himself that there is no objection from a public security point of view and has caused the Amir to be so informed. I have also reminded the Government that the furkish Immigration Law is in force. A Christian of iis Salt nameu Isa el 1/irr who was a small merchant two years ago has acquired, either by airect purchase or by foreclosing on mortgages practically all the irrigated land possessed by the Beni Hassan tribe in the Wadi Ze rka and also considerable areas of the unirrigated lands of this tribe. On being pressed Isa el Wirr admitted that he had obtained the money for these purchases from friends in Palestine but would not say who these friends are. He is leasing tne land he has acquired on a share basis to the Beni Hassan who all believe that th; money used in these transactions comes from Jewish sources , Purchases of land with Jewish money arc being carried on in other areas ae well but none of them art Put through the Land Registry, as none of them are re oogrused by the Government who have made it clear that t h invalid unless assented to by the Government. It ~y well be that the real purchasers of the land will not for many /not for many year 6 be a Hay ed to settle thereon* even if the/ succeed in having it register fid in their names on settlemen to t )o The Amir is much annoyed with Haj Amin el Husseini, whom he believes to be the source of the criticisms levelled against him in the Press and whom he accuses of being in the Kedjaz not to agt as a mediator for peace but rather with tne purpose of encouraging Ibn Saud to overhelm tne Imam ana then appear as the strong man of Arabia and tne saviour of the from the Prench, the British and the Jews. 4 , The date of His Highness’s departure for Sngland is fast approaching and he finds it embarrassing that His Majesty’s Government have decided before he leaves to what modificationB in the Anglo- Trans-Iordan Agreement of 1923 they are prepared to agree. The Amir has been shown a Supplementary Agreement which His Majesty’s Government are reaay to conclude and he is in a quandary, for he wants to conclude this Agreement but at the same time has been boasting that he will fix it all up when he gets to England. He has asked that the conclusion ol the Agreement be postponed until his return from abroad, Explaining that he wishes his people to give him tne credit of carrying out the negotiations there} he has missed, or perhaps hesitated to use, the obvious method °f disputing the terms of the Agreement to obtain the desired respite* Having been tola that delay in Publishing the Supplementary Agreement cannot be agreed he has consented / t o• 4 - he hse coneant^d to sign but ie much annoyed, Ab regards the route to be followed on hie journey to England and back, the Amir has been ridden off his scheme to come back via Europe and Turkey, because the grant made for the expenses of the journey would not have, covered this. He is going by sea to Marseilles and then across country, but on his return will travel by long sea. Preparatory to his departure His Highness has paid visits during the last few days to Jaffa, Turks rem, Nablus and Gaza where he has been entertained by the Notables. I am told that Politics were avoided and do not know what was arranged. 5. Following on the reports of the Ami#i and Shaker^s activities in the Hedjaz, the Amir was asked to agree that the Sheikhs be warned that they must remain clear of any interference# He agreed that such a warning be given by the Arab Legion, but protested that it was unnecessary. King Ali arrived by car from Baghdad on the 16th and left again for Switzerland on the 23ro* Luring part of his stay here the Damad Sheri f Add el was also the Amir* s guest. Sherif Abdel Mejia is the son of Sherif Ali Haiaar whom the i urks wished to make Sherif of Mecca in place of the Amir’s Father. Until recently the two families were at enmity but tney are now reconciled and it is probable that Talal will marry AbdeiMejid’s sister. 7. The report /7 , The report of the ^oiunitt^o is r&gt;asr to h^nh hut v^itiiaut so far the covering repjrt of the Government. Thi. most important r&lt;.communaation is for the- appointment of an officer to be known as the Director of Development. This officer is to be in charge of the cooperative movement and the Agricultural Bank* as well as the duties which his title implies. It i s the intention of th^ Committee that the person appointed should be an Englishman and to this the Government agr^tf* though they are unlikely to agree that he should have tne Agricultural Bank attached to him* 8, The Assistant British Resident has* during the month spent 10 days in the Beni Kassan country with a view to becoming thoroughly acquaintcu with tn.&lt;.ir economic position. He brings back most gloomy reports? the crop is an almost entire failure for the third year in succession, and what is worst of all is tnat the tribe appears to be thoroughly demoralised. Crop inspection has also been proceeding in other parts of the country and with the exception of certain definite failurQTthe situation is better than last year. Grazing is bad owing largely to the frost followed by drought, though in the desert gooo rains have recently fallen. The Italian Consul-General has again visited the Amir during the month and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the occasion of his recent visit has made a sum of £Pil6,000 available to tru »Associazione /6 322 . )A8s;&gt;ciaziono Hs.aionala Italic 1 for building two Bdr« hospitals in Trans-Joiaan.

In thw absence of a complaint which could be dealt v/ith by a specific charge the Executive Council, with th^ approval of the Amir have discharged Taufic Abul Huda on the ground of unsuita bility« Taufic AbuL Huda is a man who is generally unpopular but was 2 very capable official who, during his fifteen years service, If. d held the posts ^f Chief 'ftev^nue Officer, Director of Land Registry and Chief Secretary of the Government for the last six years . After the fall of the late Government he was appointed, a t my request, Manager of the Agricultural Bank, with which he had been connected fpr the last six years as President of its Administrative Council. m this capacity hu c aiic into further conflict with the Amir and the Chuf Minister in regard to the selection of the persons who should be granted loans and tneir desire to be ria 0f him WP - S further strengthened. I strongly deprecated his discharge The Government have■'' *0) 'TW - 2 - Tiw Government have, so far, nude no reasonable suggestion for filling the vacancy created by Taufic Abul Huda's discharge, and a complaint mf.de by the Amir's friend ana prottgfc , Shoi*h Mithqal Paste el Faiz of the Beni SaKhr, charging the Assistant Manager of trie Banic, who is Taufic Aoui huua» s brother-in-law, with insulting him is now b^ing investigated by the General Council of Biecipline with a view to deciding whether criminal proceedings should be insttituted or whether the complaint should be den It with by the Executive Council,, The Amir regards his success in getting rid of Taufic Abul Huda as a great victory and it is probable that the difficulties created for Departmental heaas oy His interference in their worlc will now be considerably increased. Early in February, the Arab Legion Relief Fund was given the approval of the Chief Minister and Committee of members of tnw Arab .Legion was formed* Captain B.W. Northfiela being President. Tne moneys collected wees t o be used the following (1) The Relief and Employment of Destitute Persons* ( 2 ) The Assistance of Poor Prisoners on discharge from jail. The attention of the Officer Commanding the ^ ion being drawn to the straitened circumstances of B^ni Hassan early in February an appeal, which was more ^iy broAdcast than the Amir washed or than was desirable, was made /- 3 - was made by the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion for assistance and a sum in c xccss of £Pj 1,000 in cash and kind was eventually collected. The money already set aside by the Government for Relief Work was supplemented from Government funds and provision was made therefrom for employing 560 persons on road work up till the end of March,, The Relief Fund was used in providing food where considered necessary under the control of Captain NorthfieU , whose work is to be hignly commended. Towards the end of February, it became evident that tiu camp which had be _n opened by the Relief Committee at Zerka was becoming a centre for any one in search of work and the problem too large to be dealt with by the Arab Legion Relief Committee alone. It was arranged, therefore, in consultation with the British Resident, to make a comprehensive survey of the relief measures necessary in the whole country and decided to break up the Relief Camp at Zerka where it was feared some epidemic might break out. \ recommendation has be^n made involving % the immediate expenditure of £Pi 600 in Sued grants and the following expenditure in 1934/35 from Government funds i- £Pt3,900 grants for Replenishment of Flocxao 10,500 Relief Roadwork. The Arab Legion Relief Fund will, meanwhile, continue to issue food where that appears essential, /- Some very useful- 4 - Soma very useful road work 1b includy4 in this programme, 3 , The Amir Shaker has asked for an opportunity to purchase land in the Ghor es-Safi at the southern end of the Dead Sea, Tae people living there are descended from slaves ana have b^n much oppressed in th^ past by neighbouring magnates. Efforts are being made to find a suitable area amongst them for Shaker as it is believed that his presence will assist in protecting the -rights of the cultivators there from the intrusion of their powerful neighbours. 4, On the 8 th,, His Highness the Amir and the Chief Minister were the guests of His Excellency the High Commissioner at Government House. 5, Tue Economic Ccmmi ttee , whic h was foaatfd at the suggestion of the Amir and with the approval of His Sxcelienqy' the High Commissioner, has completed ; as its tour cf the country but has not/yet submit ted its report. Its operation* were consideraoly delayed because of other urgent work which claimed tne attention of some of the members. Mr. Shepherd of the, Palestine Government, who accompanied tne Committee on two of their tours, has written valuable report s. The ^mir Half, who is going through c °urse of training at the Police School, is doing Very well and tic Amir is considering sending him Intdp to England for a few months. 7 . Tne Ami r was /XI 33b - 5 - 7. ThcJ Amir was vary aVvirso to tnu suggestion that ho might visit Ibn Sauct at Jouda on a Cruiser which should then taice him on to Suez on his way to England and when it was first put to him believed that if he dia not fall in with the suggestion his visit to England would be c p n ce 11 ed • When His Excellency the High Commissioner on his way back from Baghdad called on the Amir on the 24th ? the Amir said he hoped Ibn Saud might be informed that the Amir looked forward to meeting him at a later date. His Highness also explained how it is better for the Hashimites that Ibn Saud should be in the Hedjaz rather, than the Imam Yahya 9 since thu latter is a liberal Moslem and a Sherif and with his arrival there would remain no great reason for the shimites 1 return. On the 25th, tne first day of tne S^-ast, the Amir sent a telegram of greeting to Ibn Saud with the object of conveying to him that ho need have no fear of any interference from this direction* He has received a very cordial telegram in reply. Pilgrims entering Saudi Arabia via Tebak who are in possession of passports are, on Payment of a visa fee of £Ps 1,500 mils, having their journey facilitated. Some of these pilgrims have arrived taring letters of recommendation from the Saudi Consul Damascus, Pilgrims travelling/T i -•i - 6 - Pilgrims travelling without passj^orts have boon rcfussd entry. 9. T- riU I'utessarrif of Ma'an addressed a personal letter to the Amir of Tebuk regarding the evasion by Saudi caravans of Trans-Jordan Justoms Control and has received a friendly reply. The Amir of Tebuk has instructed all caravans to report at the Customs Control, 10 o I nm not awaro of tn.d measures taken by the Amir in regard to the option on his land in ti*- Ghor el Kibd granted by him to the Jews, but believe that he must have extended it. He has on two rviCwnt occasions made remarks which slow that he still inUnds to bring Jews into the country. It is the opinion of the Amir Shaker that the present Government has bcun formed expressly for that purpose, I am informed that the Amir met Palestine Arab leaders early in the month in the Jordan valley in a n attempt to gain their support on the occasion of bis visit to England, It is said that the Palestine y leaders refused to commit themselves and on the 24tn the Amir referred to the Mufti Haj Amin el Hussdini as buing entirely unreliable and a liar. It is believed that the Palestine Arabs win hold a meeting at some uate prior to the Amir’s departure to air tneir views in a public manner ln r ^gprd to the Union of Trans-*Jordan ana Palestine a the Amir’s Candidature to the resulting thronehostilities in Arabia there have be^n signs of a reconciliation between the Amir and Shaker* The latter was invited by the Amir to accompany him in the journey he made ifcto the desert during the recent Feast, but declined to ao so unless he was given a separate ca r at the Amir’s expense 0 This the Amir refused to do and was v^xea because Shaker rejected his invitation,, A further reason for anger against Shaker was th&gt;- news that Shaker had walked with tn&lt;* members of the Arab Executive at tne funeral of Musa Ka zim Pasha, The Amir’s comment on receipt of this news was ’’Shaker will be an Istirlalist until he -dies * 0 13* According to the Amir, Hussein el To.rawneh has seen the oerror of his ways and has abandoned the Istiqlalists to tl;e ir fate. 14* in the draft Bon Voisinags Agreement v^ith Syria, the signature of which is so long delayed, it is provided tnat Beau animals shall be enumerated where found but shall pay the tax to country in which they a re living after the 1st* July.

Tne invitation was unofficial because of the Court mourning and His Highness judged it better, in jfcne circumstances, no£ to accept., A lecture was given in Amman by an Italian Doctor on the connection between Eastern and Astern medicine; in reality the lecture was a piece of Propaganda endeavouring to show that the Italians were fcore sympathetic to tne Arabs than were other ^uropuan Scions. • The Italian Hospital in Amman gave towards the Beni H*ss?n belief Fund.

A reliable Christian of HeraK /ias saia that since tne fo mat ion of tne new Government tne feeling between Moslems ana Christians is xuuch eas ier. The Legislative Council reassembled after the Ramaahan recess on the 22nu of January and, counting the perioa of the recess as o.rt of its three months’ Ordinary Session, completed its final session on the 31st. January. Tne Ordinance modifying Artiwie 3 of the Press Law of 1325 ana the Puolic Meeting p OruiQanQ9 which were passea by the Amir in Council in tcie sumtuer of 1933 were laiu before the Council required by Article 41 of tne Organic Law. Tne former was accepted by tne Council but the latter met with strong opposition by the Istiqlalist minority /by the Istiqlalist minority who, finding their opposition gainea no support, marched out of tne Council Chamber and tnus left the remaining members without a sufficient number to fonn 3 quorum. A quorum, however, was fomea at tne following meeting and tne Puolxc Meetings Ordinance was passed. This brush in tne Legislative Council has furnished tne occasions for tne Opening of the attack on the Government ana X attach a translation of a letter addressed to His Highness the Amir by the Secretary of the Executive Committee of the National Congress, Hussein Pasha el Tarawneh, A copy of this letter was sent to the Chief Minister and another handea t 0 me *y a deputation composed of Hussein Pasha el Tarawneh, bio Abu Ghanimeh, Salim Abu Ghanam and Himr Hammud, Tne person s m&amp;nti oned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the letter were dealt with shortly afte* the disorderly demonstration on tne 31st« October whilst those mentioned in paragrapn 3 were later sent to Aqaba for intriguing again ct to ^ c n t* $ authority in Trans-Jordan.

The very genuine fear which was felt by a number of prominent officials that tne new Government might find means to turn them out of office must, I think, have been due to the contents of a Report, written by the Officer Commanding the «rab Legion, which became known* Tilis import ^ade recommendations for the aischsfge or reauction in graae of a number of officials but fortunately th* Chief Imister has gone no further than ta issue warnings in some cases. To allow a change in Government to be followed by a change in the holders of a number of the senior ana non political posts in the Service would create a most dangerous precedent* o, Tne Legislative Council adjourned on tne 7th. of Lee ember for tne month of Ramadan anu the t»nief Minister, whose intention he wishes kept strictly Secret, will probably make use of the meaning which can be read into Article 29 of the Organic x*ew compute this period of adjournment as a P artl three months duration of the ordinary s^-sion, will mean that if the Council reassembles on the 20th, of January it will only remain in session a further eleven days till it is finally dissolved on the 31st, of January* 4. On tne aay of the Council 1 a adjournment the Government made a /■1UM Govcrtimjnt made a statement to the effect that the provisions of the Bill, providing that land might only be sold, mortgaged or leased to foreigners afoer the Government’s permission had be^n obtained, wore not reariy in trie incerests of the people and t iat a more satisiactory law would be prepared and jresentea to the Gouncil later.. This Bill has been a source of considerable embarrassment to the Government ana na s proviuea a stick for the opposition to oeat triem with anu the anief lu-inister s statement was made witn the object of minimising the propaganda against him during the Ramadan recess. He says that the lav/ he promises to produce for the consideration of the Council will be on the basis of the Egyptian five feoden law. 5o The recent troubles in Palestine have again brought forward the question of the enactment of the Transjordan defence Law ana a law to provide a closer control over the- possession and carrying of firearms. As to the former the Amir was Hfifc mos unwilling that it should be placed before the present Gouncil which he declared was Certain to throw it ou ana it has been agreed that it snail oe placed before the new Gouncil in its* first ordinary session in a form which will follow the ^resent draft provisions but which may approximate in appearance to the Ottoman Martial Law. As regards the letter the Amir’s assurance that he will keep hie people hand and will do all he can to minimise the smuggling of ^rms into Palestine has been accepted ?na the bem-nd for legislation provisionally withdrawn, but *us Highness has been informed that if his assuran proves inefiective /3- r oVt ;b inc-t i active trxc aoiucnu v^ill be ^rceynted a^ain. tn i b solution xif-b been acce^tba by ebu Government witii r-iitf • Intensive me-sures have been carried out D • since o- rly in November by the Transjordan Frontier S'orce -nd by the lalestino Police on the frontier between lalcstine ^nd Transjordan North of the ^eed Sc^ with a view to siezing smuggled arms.

The Legislative Council opened 1 . on the 1 st; the only extraordinary incident curing the ceremony was the maintenance of silence for two minutes in memory of King Fe isal . On the completion of trie ceremony the Council elected the members of its various Conmittees and so arranged matters that no member of the Executive Council was elected to any one of these Conmittees. In pursuance of this policy of non-cooperation with the Chief Minister and his Executive Council the transaction of any business at subsequent meetings of the Legislative Council was prevented by members absenting themselves so that there should be no quorum. This procedure was adopted at the instigation of the Amir who had finally decided to drop the Kizb el Istiqlal, with which he had been flirting and pin his faith to the Hizb t;ih-Sha t ab^ which he had formed seme months ago to breax tne Istiqla lists and resist the plan supported by them a nd King Faisal of amalgamating Trans-Jordan with Iraq. Of the 16 elected /— o_ Or the 16 elected members of tne Le'is i at iv e Council 14 are members of the Hizb esh- Sha 1 ab and the Amir had determined by their help to render the task of the Government impossible and to bring about its fall. I had advised the Amir to keep the nresent Government in power until the end of the current session of the Legislative Council, which is the last of the Council’s three years duration or alternatively, if the Council made the Government’s task impossible, to first disniss the Council and then dismiss the Chief Minister and anoint a new one to form a new Executive Council. On the 15th the Amir in an interview with His Excellency the High Commissioner at Government House in Jerusalem informed His Exceii ency that ne wished to change his Chief Minister and to retain the present Legislative Council for the full period of three years. The Amir stated that this could not be regarded as the dismissal of the Government by the Legislative Council, because it was the Amir himself who had arranged that there should bv no ouo rum. a ^ At its last session the Le w isla tivu Council, at the motion of an elected member, had passed a resolution calling on the Government to prepare a law providing that Foreigners might only buy * lease or mortgage land in Trans-Joiuan after having obtained the permission of tn 1 Government. The Amir had been /-3- The Amir had been desired by His Excellency the Ki^h Gormissioner to arrange that this law should not be enacted and advised that it would be in his own interest that he should prevent its further discussion in the Council rather than that the Council should pass it and that he should then withhold his assent. The Amir had undertaken to act accordingly, but it had been necessary on several occasions to keep him up t o the mark, his difficulty being that the lew had been published as a bill and that the private member who had introduced it is a member of the Hi zb el Istiqlal and not a member of the Amir’s Hi zb esh-Sha’ab. At his interview with His Excellency the Amir informed him that it was with the object of preventing this law from coming before the Legislative Cc unci]; that he bad arranged there should be no quorum. It was pointed out to the Amir that, he would be in the same difficulty ^ith regard to this lav/ unless he changed his Legislative Council, but as His highness that he coutu bring about the desired result without any change there was no alternative but to agree that he should carry on as he desired. In agreeing that he should do so, His Excellency said that he had accepted the Amir 1 s recommendation but warned him that if His highness’s plan did not prove successful he would be less ready to agree to a line of action proposed by him in future. 4 .

R 1333 o R T OR THE ^_ULaxj_oj for the month ,-,f ^CTQ 3 l.:R. r iq^ 11 ° n the 3rti of October, H i s Highness tneAnur prepared a proclamation addressed to the Arabs generally calling upon them to unite. Copies of the proclamation were given by His Highness to a number of Arab nationalists in order to give them an opportunity of commenting on the text prior to its issue. The Acting British Resident heard of the proclamation at the time of the issue of the drafts arranged for a suggestion to be made to His Highness that it would be preferable to aliav the High Commissioner for Trans-JoMan to see the proclamation fore it was published as the document might affect adjacent Arab countries as well as Trans-Jordan- His Highness the Amir gave the ^ting British Resident a copy of the draft on the thOctooerand subsequently agreed to postpone cation until after he had received the High Commissioner's comments. On the 16th of October, His Highnese showed tb^ draft to members of the Istiqlal Party who v* 12 i ■f* Vi * im at Amman and they, whilst expressing approval, if they might produce an alternative ft They have not yet done so. His Excellency has now asked the Amir PuolisH the proclamation* 2 . The3- 6 . A branch of the Arab Bank of Palestine is to be opened in Amman shortly and premises have already been leased for 1 }he new branch. 7 . His Highness the Amir is anxious that Abbas Hilmi Pasha, the ex-Khedive, should be given permission to visit Trans-Jordan and Palestine and has been informed that there is no objection to his making a short stay in each country. 8 . It has been the belief in the tov/n of Amman that the Government would be changed immediately after the return of the British Resident. Lieut.-Golone1 Cox arrived in Tram- Jordan on the 25rd. and has suggested to the Amir that he should withhold consideration of changing the Government until the end of the final session of the Legislative Council which opens on the 1st of November. 9 , The Amir and the Chief Minister have agreed to withhold from discussion by the Legislative Council the draft Law which was published as a bill providing that foreigners could only s&gt;edrr&gt; mortgage or lease land for more than three years after having obtained the sanction of the Government. 10. In sympathy with the Arabs in Palestine demonstrations were hela in Amman on Saturday the 28th a-nd in Ir.bid, Es Salt anci Taf-^leh on the ^Oth and the Amir has received numerous telegrams and deputations from'Jerusalem and the Trans-Jordan People’s Party /-4- I60'i Party asking for his mediation in putting an end to Jewish immigration. Further demonstrations were heiu at Amman on the 31st. and at Kerak on the 1st. of November, whilst the people of Jebel Ajlun handed in a document of protest on the 31st. of October. His Highness states that the Arabs of Palestine are ready to recognise as Palestinians those Jews who have already come to Palestine and that in admitting them the Brit ish Gov ernment has fulfilled its obligations to the Jews under the Balfour De clara tion. How, however, Palestine can hold no more and is, indeed, over full already as is proved by the reports of those experts who have visited Palestine to examine the situation. Any further influx of Jews is therefore, he considers, an indication that this excess is destined for neighbouring Arab States, and of this these neighbouring States are highly apprelmnsi. Amman. 1st. November, 1933. BRITISH RESIDSkT.SECRET* 1 V * Cut REPORT ON THE P.Z. 6997 P O L I I I G A L SXTUAli3;j5&amp; for the month of SEPTElOERt 1933. I His Highness the Amir’s attack on the Trans-Jordan Congress and Istiqlal Party continued during the early part of the month and I had to discourage a proposal of His Highness to send the leaders of the Istiqlal Party in enforced residence to Aqaba because they were preparing a petition to the League of Nations on the subject of the partisan attitude of the Amir of Tran s-J o rdan . . The Trans-Jordan Congress organised a meeting to take place at Kerak on the 15th September, in opposition to the People’s Congress and local feeling at Kerak was so acute on the subject that a breach of the peace seemed possible. The Trans-Joruan Government therefore passed as an Ordinance a draft Public Meetings Law taking power to prohibit all puolic meetings if sucha course was advisable. This Ordinance will come before the Legislative Council for confirmation at the next ordinary session of that body. The news of King Faisal’s death, received on the 8 th Septembe r, diverted the interest from local politics and the immediate reaction of His Highness the Amir was to reconci lethe Istiqlal Party and to for their support to enable him to take his brother place as avowed leader of the Arab National cause. Adil el Azmeh and Auni Abdul Hadi, both Istiqlal l ea travelled to Baghdad in the Amir’s suite.- 2 - Aft^r his return from Baghdad His Highness ook s teps to appease the members of the People’s Congress who had been incensed at his sudden change of attitude towards the Istiqlal Party. His Highness seems to be attempting the difficult feat of retaining the favour of both parties. It is currently rumoured that certain elements amongst tne leaders of the People’s Congress are not so opposed to Jewish immigration to Trans-Jordan as they would have the rest of the party believe. 2 The local reaction to King Paisal 1 s death was a somewhat hysterical outburst of grief with a distinctly anti-European and anti-Christian bias. The . report that Faisal had been poisoned by the British or, if not by the British, by the Swiss who are all Christians, was current in Amman. All shops were closed for four days and a memorial service at the Losquc followed by a procession to the cemetery took place in Amman 15th September, the day of the funeral at Baghdad Anti-British speeches were made by two individuals of Syrian origin who came to Trans-Jorua as refugees during the Syrian rebellion. His Highness the Amir left for Baghuaa on the 12th September ana returned to Amman aceompanie by King Ali on the 24 th September. His highness the Amir Talal was appointed as regent during His father’s absence. The Amirs Tolsl and Naif /The Amirs Talsl a na Naif went to Keifn to meet the body of the deceased King and having accepted ^tv/o invitations, one from the District Commissioner ana one from the Municipality of Haifa, kept neither appointment. Tilc: Arab Legion post remained in sole occupation of Hazim until the 8 th September, when u party of fifteen Saudi soldiers arrived on the scene and campea within a few yards of the Trans-Joidan post. T\iey intimated that they had cane to stay but ms inteined a friendly attitude. The following day the S&amp;udi soldiers moved their camp to a point about a mile and n half east of the Aells and two days later, on the 8 th, they movea back a further f .,0 miles which placed them in all probability in Saudi territory. x hey continued, however, to water at the Huzim we 11 s. Relations between the personnel of the two posts were cordial and visits were freely exchanged. Hamid Pasha el Wadi, ^n ex-officer of His Highness the Amir’s suite, who was requested to leave Tr-n^-joman on account of his connection with the Ibn afada affair, applied for and was granted permission to ^turn to Trans-Jordan for a short period in order to L ttle certain personal affairs. 5 1 Ho ha me d Pasha el Pin el Ha lab i, the leader of the Druze refugees at Nebk in the Wadi Sirhan, passed u gh. Trans-Jordan on the 12 th September on his way to where he proposed to assist at the ceremonies ^ing the arrival of the remains of King Paisal saad then t L 0 Pass a few days at a Pruze village on Mount Carmel. 6 . Although the /-4- 6 . Although tne native Trans-J cr aanian s have shown little interest in the matter, the developments of the situation in the Asir are being 1 oil owed. closely by residents in Trans-Joraan who are of Hedjnzi origin. So far I have not noticed any inclination towards active intervention in the form o-l attempts to embarrass Ibn Saud by encouraging subversive movements in the Hedjsz. Amman. 2 nd October, 1935.

Tne meeting,foretold in paragraph 2 of my report for the month of July, took place on the 6 th of August, 1933, it was well attended and pas sed off* 'witiiout untoward incident. The persons present took upon themselves the title of the '’Congress of the People of Trans-Jordan* and an Executive Committee of some thirty persons was elected at the conclusion of the meeting with a President, Naji Pasha Azzctm and two&gt; secretaries, Said Bey El Mufti and Nejib Bey Shereidi. The resolutions of the new Congress formed the subject of a separate report ana were , in fact, hardly distinguishable frcm the resolutions made by the other Congress in Trans-Jordan, The success of the Congress of the People of Trans-Jordan resulted in a general offensive directed by His Highness the Amir eg a ins t the members of the old Trans-Jordan Congress in general and the members of the Istiqlal Party in particular. Following on the formation of the new Congress, Adil el Asmeh and Subhi Abu Ghanimeh, doth members of the Istiqlal Party, issued a new paper the contents of which were more or less scurrilous &amp;buse of the political opponents of the founders. Peeling ran high and on the 22 nd instant Subhi Abu Chanimeh was thrashed in the main street of Amman by &amp; youth from /2 - by * youth frc™ Ee Salt who had i m p licated in the past in similar incidents. It became clear that unless the situation was taken in hand further incidents would occur and it was decided to suppress the new paper and to require a number of politically minded youths, who were in Amman in search of positions in the Government Service and ripe for any mischief, to return to their native towns. In c-onnection with the suppression of the new paper, it was necessary to issue a short Ordinance under Article 41 of the Organic Law, to amend the Ottoman Press Law so as t o make it necessary for the Government's assent to be obtained for the issue of any newspaper. This step was required in order to prevent the suppressed paper from reappearing the foliov/ing day under a new name. The Ordinance in question will came before the Legislative Council for confirmation °r rejection at the next session of that body. Tension arose between His Highness and the Trans-Jordan Government over tht question of the imprisonment of a certain Abdel Hamid Ibn Adwan who was condemned by the Courts to ten years imprisonment for shooting two men in an affray which took place in the Jordan Valley eighteen months ago • The convicted person is the brother I ajid Pasha el Adwan who was His Highness’s ftsin organiser of the Congress of the People of Trans ~J orda n. There is no doubt /1 -3- There is no doubt that His Highness intends to pardon Abdel Hamid and His Highness asked that in the meantime Abael Hamia should be confined in the guard house of the Palace and not placed in the Central Prison as an ordinary convic t. This proposal was opposed by th GocT-ernment on general grounds but eventually His Highness insisted on the Acting Officer Commanding the Arab Legion making the necessary order under Article 3 of the Prison Lav/ of 1927 directing that the Palace Guard House should he a prison within the meaning of that article . This the Acting Officer Commanding the Arab region reluctantly agreed t o do . 4. On the 25th and 26th instants meetings took place at Deir Abu Said and Irbid respectively in support of the Trans-Jordan Congress and in opposition of the new People 1 s Congress. The meetings v/ere peaceable. 5. The excitement over the suggested annexation of Trans-Jordan to the Iraq seems to have died down. I am assured that King Faisal actually suggested the change to His Highness during his visit to Amman in June. 6 . S&amp;rly in August frequent reports were received of recruiting of men from the tribes °f the northern Hedjaz and there was no lack of sensation mongers who translated these reports into preparations against Trans-Jordan. It is clear, however, that the persons recruited were to be used as re en fore erneas re-enforcements to the Saudi forces on the Yemen front!er. On the 3rd. August, 193 3, the exchange of letters, cancelling outstanding claims between Trans-Jordan and Saiidi Arabia in respect of raids which took place between the 1st, August, 1930 and the 27th July, 1933, was completed. Towards the end of July, 1933, 8 . it became evident that the Saudi Governor of Karsiyat ellCelh had designs on the wells of HAZ113 which are situated in Trans-Joraan but near to the frontier. Several parties of Beduin watering at KAZIIC were interferea with by the Saudi soldiers and on the 6 th August, 1933, a patrol of the Desert Pat rol of the Arab Legion found a psrty of Saudi soldiers on the wells, in charge of a non-Commissioned Officer v/ho fired a shot over the Trans-Jordan cars. The question assumed immediate importance towards the end of August, because the Trans-Jordan tribes were moving in the direction oi HA2IM, in search of grazing and would ultimately water at the wells. On tne 21st. August, 1933, two cars of the Arab Legion visited HAZH3 and formed a camp there. They were visited the following day by three R. A. machines which landed near theA't trio in07118111!) of t. K i 8 arrival of the Arab Legion the wells were unoccupied but a number of Saudi herdsmen, accompanied by two Saudi soldiers , were grazing near by. The latter left en route for Xaf as soon as the Arab Legion installed themselves on th e we 11 s 9.

The meeting organised during June by the ' Hi zb ei Tadumoun', of which Party rithqal El Jaiz ia the leader, took place at Amman on the 1st. of July, 1933, Ko untoward incident took place and the meeting produced a set of resolutions the gist of which was (a) that the Government should collect no taxes from cultivators due in respect of the cur rent/or attempt to wring arrears out of the starving (b) that the Government should take steps to introduce foreign capital into the country to stave off stagnation or starvation. The drafters of the resolutionc did not make any suggestion as to how the Government was to continue to pay its way after P tically all collections of revenue ceased. The number of attendants was fifty Or -t- • S1X y persons ^ few individuals of note or influence responded to the numerous invitations issued. Following on the failure of the Tadamoun' to raise any enthusiastic response, Hls Highness the Amir proceeded to prepare for a t Vi i A r Congress to be constituted of sheikhs. The purposes new con Sress are avowedly to produce 'sensible' Posals for political and economic reform and to fitm the complete trust of all the leaders of the native born /-2 native born Trains-Jordanians in the person of the Amir. It is probable that the projected meeting will take place in August. 3. Shortly after King Faisal's departure for Europe, rumours became current of a scheme to annex Trans-Jordan to Ufe Iraq and so remove all possibility of this country being thrown opun to Jewish immigration which would mean, in the minds of most Arabs, ultimately annexation to Palestine. The Amir Shaker is credited with being party to this plot of King Faisal* and toy acting as the King's agent in the matter. The Amir is upset by these rumours which may partly explain an unusually conciliatory attitude evident on his part of late in dealing with British officials. In the course of the visit of Fuad Bey Hamza to Amman, mentioned later in this report. His Highness suggested the desirability of his cooperating with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in the matter of enlargening His Highness’s dominions to the north and to the west, that is to say, at the expense of Syria and Palestine. Whether Ibn Saud would in fact welcome any extension of the Hashimite power is questionable . The negotiations of the Trans jordan - Saudi Treaty of Friendship came to a successful conclusion at Jerusalem on the 27th July, 1933 ^hen the Treaty was signed and certain letters Exchanged regarding beduin tribes and their affairs* On the following /-3- r On the following day Fuad Bey Hanza, the Saudi delegate, visited Ammon where he was received with military honours and received by His Highness the Amir half an hour before other visitors were due. His n igbness' s reception of Fuaa Bey was cotdial and they indulged in an animated conversation during the official luncheon party which folio’wed . The speech of His Highness and the reply of the Saudi delegate made at the end of the meal were happily worded and seemed to give pleasure to both parties. His Highness, however, was in a bad temper prior to the arrival of his visitors and threatened at one time to dismiss tbs guard of the Arab Legion which was mounted in honour of the visitors on the grounds that there was no reason v/hy Hu ad Bey Hamza should be shown such over- helming honours. He relented however when it v.as pointed out that as much if not more honour fod oetn shown to the Trans-Jordan delegation on its arrival at Jedda. The population of Trans-Jordan a s a whole showed little interest in the negotiations and were more concerned in the competition, now a parently annual event, for remi ssion' taxation• 5. Interest in the question of t-e disposal of His Highness’s lands in tbe Ghor Kibd to Jewish buyers revived by the disecovery of a number of /a nuiub^r oT Jcv/ish. visitors gatlioring siiinplas of soil from various parts of the Ghor cl Kibd. After making o shov/ of erecting 6 # barbed wire fences round the land they desire to acquire on the enste rn bank of the Jordan at t he t ra di t i on a 1 site of the Place of Baptism, the Orthodox clergy appear to have acquiscod to the statement made by the Trans-Jordan Government to the effect that the land in question was state domain and would remain such* 7. The recrudescence of ill feeling between I'oslems and Christians, referred to in my Political Report for June, died away without further trouble occurring. 2nd Augus t, 1933 . ACTIhG BRITISH RESIDENT.SECRET. REPORT ON THE P,.Q_L,I TICAL SITUATTO for the month of JUNE. 19.^. N ! RECEIVED i C, O, REGX 1» The Trans-Jorhan Congress met in Amman on the 7th June, 1933, under the presidency of Hussein Pasha Tarawneh. The proceedings of the Congress,on which a separate report has been rendered, were orderly. The main object of the meeting appeared to be the organisation of opposition to the new party headed by Fithqal Pasha el Faiz namely, M Hizb el Tadamon'. The utterances against the Mandatory were not more extreme than usual. 2* Thepromoters of the w Hizb el Tadamon n continue their efforts to bring about a Congress of their own but had not succeeded to do so by the end of the month. 0 • Hisldajesty King Faisal arrived from Baghdad on the 5th June, 1933, and stayed in Amman until the morning of the 9th June. Deputations of Arab politicians came from Palestine and Syria to endeavour to interest King Faisal m their respective cases. Whilst expressing sympathy with the Arab cause in general terms tbe King’s utterances regarding the local politics of Palestine, Trams-Jo roan and Syria were correct and discreet. Discussions were commenced at Beirut on the 13th June, 1933, regarding the teiras of the draft /a ? Bor B'oi-Rinago. 1aotw«On Trans-Jordan and Syria. Considerable progress was made in the preparation of an agreed draft. The Chief Minister continued to be absent from his work, owing to sickness throughout the month and the Chief Secretary to the Government has ac tod in his stead. The day before the departure of the British Resident on leave His Highness the Amir hinted at the possibility of an immediate change of Government, but reverted during a talk on the subject to the original proposal that the existing Government should be changed at the end of the next session of the Legislative Council. With the next session ends the life of the present Counci 1 . 6 King Kaisal’s arrival in Trans-Jordan brought about a Visit from Hamid iasha el ..adi who came under the King's personal protection. His Highness the Amir had promised that Hamid Pasha should not re-enter Trans-Jordan but had taken no steps to secure that end. Hamid Pasha himself had not be.en informed of the Amir’s promise. The appearance in the ’’Keraut es h- oherk” newspaper of Palestine of objectionable articles, critieising the h&amp;bits of His Highn*. the Amir and the Chief Minister over the signature of a local Christian, led to a great dual feeling between Christians and Moslems. The tension culminated in an assault, on the 27th June,in th main road of Amman, of the Chief elerk oi the Department, a /-3- Baportment, a Ohrietian^ by a. Tbo nsn guilty ol tha assault was arrested and will be brought to trial. The Christians allege that the offender was instigated by more highly placed persons to commit the assault but no evidence to this effect can be produced as yet nor is any likely to be forthcoming in the future. Thu reason given for the assault on the officer in question is the general belief that he was partly responsible for the offensive articles. This I do not believe to be the case. 8 . King All left Trans-Joraan for Europe via Haifa on the 20th June and was greatly pleased by the unusually ceremonious reception he was given by the Hrench authorities at Deraa. As is usual in such cases the geste was read as having deep political motives not unconnected in this case with the throne of Syria. i»t. July, 1933 . AOTIKO BRITISH RESIHBHT.33CRST. R S R EC l. i V E D 19 JUN J933 C. 0. HEGI [ ^ ^ W8S reP0rted in the last paragraph of the Political Report for Kerch that a proposal, made by a private member to the Legislative Council to enact a law governing the disposal 0 f land to foreigner, resulted in a resolution that the Executive Council should prepare and publish the necessary dra ft. This resolution has been wrongly represented in many quarters in Palestine as evidence that the Legislative Council was in favour of the disposal of land to Jews. It is probable that the true state or affair in this regard will be elucidated at the meeting of the Arab National Party which is to take place in Amman on the 6 th of June, 1933. It was said that a number of speakers from Palestine would speak at this meeting, which will ce mainly concerned with the subject of the entry of Jews into Trans-Jordan, but it is now Practically certain that none but residents of Trans- Jordan win be allowed to speak. Certain Palestine papers have stated* h satisfaction, that in opposition to this 'fig another meeting will be called about the same y Sheikh Fithqal Pasha el Faiz and have given fiames of a number of praninent people who will Su Pport birr T 4 - D1, It is understood that, in fear of public opinion /public _ ia^ia and that the notables referreri t „ , «erred to have publicly disassociated themselves from anv c m any a esire to brimr Jews into Trans-Jordan. The 1 - i8Si0n from Trans-Jordan, which left for Jedda on the 17th of April a- April to discuss Treaties of Friendship an d ofE x tradi(-i Extradition with the Government of Saudi Arabia, returned e , ’ xe tu rned to Amman on the 0th of ifav. * Y Th6 P ° lnts of y iew of the two Governments in regard to S^ra to Extradition were so widely apart that it was agreed tn=h j agreed to abandon any attempt to conclude an Extradition Treaty. G reat progress was made t0WardS ag — t - tenns of the Treaty of Friendship with an Arbitration Protocol, but unfortunately the whole ground had not been cleared before the d ay on whicil the Mission had ar,„ ge dto leave. Negotiations are to v, ions are to be resumed in Jerusalem towards the end of July. On the return of the Mission, the ^ ■ 1 r sent a telegran to King A bdul A ziz, thanking for the cordial reception extended to the Mission, received a telegram couched in friendly language ln reply. 3. . Curing the absence of the Mission m ir had fallen foul of hi s Chi ef Mini st er who efused to arbitrarily place in forced residence t Aqaba th6 youn gmen from Es Salt who had been Promi nen t in the demonstrations on the 12th February 3 nd who n -ft ^ _ teing pardoned by the Amir and brought y hllI &gt; to Amman with promises of appointment to posts in the Government, /in the Government, had ex pr-e-s sea • their indignation when they found thst no vsiCHnciss existed This has caused the Amir to iss^ue an order, as ht has power to do under the law, reversing a decision of the Chief Minister in regard to the discharge of a number of non-Tr a ns-Joraanian officials and, secondly, to again express his desire to change the Chief Minister and his Government• In is suihg the order to discharge the non-Trans-Jordanian officials the Ami r has broken a promise made to the British Resident that he would not assent to any further recommendations made under a lav/ which should have been executed once and for all in 1929 . He has been advised to withdraw his order and has been informed that to allow it to be executed would be unjust and against the interests of the Government and good Administration. He has, however, expressed his intention to persist. 4* On the 16th tho A.mir was the guest of Hassan Khalid Pash* in Jerusalem, and under arrangements made by the latter, met certain prominent Jews , A day or two later Hassan Khalid -t'asha left for England bearing letters to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir John Chancellor and Sir Herbert Samuelt. The letters to the first and second of the above named persons were, it is said, merely to introduce Hassan Khalid, whilst to that/Sir Herbert Samuel was to ask him to arrange for the removal/4- for the removal from Tran s-j Oman of ^Colonel Cox. Hassan Khalid has been instructed, it is said, to work t o tha t end. A message was conveyed to the Amir on the 17th by the person he had chosen to ase as intermediary in the matter that the Briti sh Resident was not ready to agree to any change in Government until the tenrination, next January, of the present Legislative Council and that Rikabi Pasha, who had been mentioned as the new Chief Minister, was quite inacceptable. The Amir has agreed to await the termination of the present Council before making any change and is said to have agreed the more readily as he wishes first to know the result of Hassan Khalid’s mission. 5. On the 20th the Amir was strongly advised to terminate the appointiaent of Zeid el Atrash (Sultan Pasha El Atrash’s brother) whom he had been foolish enough to make honorary A. D • C. This His Highness has promised to do, but, not being assisted by Zeid himself, who has been told that he should resign, the conclusion of the matter is still delayed. S' of the land granted to him by lav/, with the concurrence of His Majesty 1 s Government, the Amir has leased for a small rent that part of the Zor which he cleared with the £.3000 granted him, he has been in negotiation with the Jews for the lease of the Gho r el Kibid, and has now leased El Hommar to a £ruz for £P$ 150 per annum. The hope that this land might give sn object in life to the Amir’s younger son has thus not materialised but it is being arranged-5- that this young man is to marry the grand daughter of oultan Abde 1 Aziz of Turicey* The lady at present lives in Egypt and has some money. 7. T-^e Amir has refused to approve the re commend at ion of the Judicial Adviser and the Minister of Justice that Saleh Bassesso* a member of the Court of Appeal t should be transferred to the Court of First Instance at Kerak . This refusal is most improper ani is due to the fact that the Amir wishes to influence the decisions of the Court of Appeal through this individual who is under his thumb.

In »y Report for Deoa.ber 1932, I stated that Talal and Shakar had not visited Jaffa on the 16th of that month. My statement was based on an assurance given he by the Amir Talal. I regret, however, to find that there is very good reason to believe that the visit to Jaffa actually did take place. 2. On the 2nd January the Amir complained of the fact that Abbas Hilmi had been dissuaded from visiting him in Amman and said he intended to approach the High Commissioner on the matter. I advised him not to do so as I believed that he would not receive a favourable reply. On the 4th he sent one oi his Staff to shew me a letter he had written to the High Commissioner, but decided not to send this letter forward on again hearing that I advised against it. Un the 12th Abbas Hilmi Pasha having spent the preceding nirdit in Tiberias was expected in Mafrak on his way through to Baghdad. The Amir, at the request of the High Coinaissioner, refrained from meeting him and after spending that night and the following day at Mafrak as the guest of the Iraq Petroleum Company, whose advanced base is at that place, ha continued his journey to Baghdad accompanied by Hamid Pasha el adi. On the 25th the Amir enquired whether it was held to be undesirable for Abbas Hilmi to return via Trans- Jordan but it was arranged that the ex-Khedive should make hishis westward journey through Syria. o. Considerable excitement has been caused by the rumours which hare been enlcrged on in the Press that the Amir has entered into an arrangement to lease his land in the Ghor el Kibid (an area of some 60,000 dunoums situated in the Jordan 7alley) to Jews. deputations to dissuade His Highness from this hare waited on him in Amm?n and a declaration that the reports that the Amir had leased his land to the Jews were entirely without foundation was issued under His Highness*s instructions for publication in the Press. Actually the Amir has signed a iocniient which he has shewn to me, which gives tha Jews an option to lease this land ana the right to exercise that option within six months. 1 have asked His Highness whether his declaration means that he no longer considers hims elf bound to execute the document he has signed and have been told that the declaration does not refer to this option at all but only to the Notice published some days ago in the papers that the Amir desires to lease the (rhor el Kibid. He assures me, however, that it is clearly understood between him an^the Jews that he must be released from his bargain with them in the presence of fo rog i s ,' eure This may be so, but is certainly not provided for in the signed document. The Amir was informed on the IBth that the Hip’ll Commissioner considered it inadvisable t hat the £mir should lease his land to the Jews and on the 21 st was advised not to further co.imit himself until the High Commiesioner had bad an opportunity of fully studying the matter. The point view of the Amir*a Advisers is that whether the Mandatory lower advises him to procefu T ith, hePriest that an entertainment, which was ttaking place in the Latin Church building in celebration of the Priest's name aaj and which included the presentation of a play entitled St.A^atha,was an illegal assembly and should be dispersed. On the ri declining to comply the Kaimakam proceeded to the spot ith armed police and broke up the assembly by force. The case is being investigated, 6 . A woman of Amman who is a member of the Protestant Oommunity, states that sihe has had a vision and showed a mark on her forehead representing a cross and an eagle which she says was i .printed there by an angel who blessed her and her house, Thishas caused considerable local interest but the mark has no* disappeared, 7. The Palestine Potash Limited have applied for areas in Trans-Jordan at the Northern and Southern ends of the Dead Sea for making additional evaporation pans. The Government is now considering these applications and it is believed that no objection to the grant will be made, r 8 * The Secretary of State for Air during his stay in Amman on the 17th and 18th called on the Amir, 9. The new pictorial set of Trans-Jordan postage Jian ps b eing advertised for release on the 1st of February it 1,7as with some consternation that I learned at 6.15 p,m.on the 31st January that the Amir had ordered the iseue should be dplayed because the name of the Artist (a Christian) who had designed the frames appeared on the stamps. The Amir was in camp near the Allenby Bridge without a telephone and a personal visit was necessary to inauce him to rescind his order. lu. Relations between Moslems and Christians are far from good, and I am informed that the local members of the l ^o q! Istiklal are doing their best to make them worse. 3rd February , 1933 . (Sd) C.H.P.

Report for the month of December, 1932, on the political situation in Trans-Jordan by the British Resident, Amman. (A copy of this Report has also been sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah). Description.■I 1 - R-i: P 0 T stium tJLL O-L.fi AJL—OJtJLOLJLjO lor the mflnth of 1 ^ 9 , ^ !• Oa the 1 st Deoeraber Hamid Pasha el Wadi left for Baghdad whither he ha^ been urgently summoned by his brother. Before he left I had an opportunity of seeing his passport which gives no evidence of his presence in France in July last and goes to shew therefore that probably the story of his buying arms in the ut ^tienne factory, near Marseilles, is without foundation. 2. The reports from toyal Air Force sources that the Amirs Tal&amp;l and 3haker called on Taher Dabba^i in Jerusalem and next day took him in the Arnica car to Jaffa to meet Ali Dabbagh, as well as the report that Tah r Babbagh had spent the night c£ the 19th/20th in Amman on his way to Baghdad are inaccurate and misleading. The facts are, 1 believe, as follows:- On or before the 13th December the ^mir Talal informed me that he and Shaker were going on a jaunt to Jerusalem and stay at the Modern Hotel, provided the Amir did not wish to take them with him on his forthcoming trip to Kerak. They went to Jerusalem in the afternoon of the 15th* Taher Babbagh had arrived in Jerusalem on the 14th, having been hurried out of Cairo where he had arrive! on the 12th and was also a guest at the Modern Hotel* It is quite possible and even probable that bhak-r knew Taher was in Jerusalem before he left Amman but 1 am fully persuaded that he did not know Taher would be there /hen the visit was first planned. It would, in my opinion, be wrong to seriously blame uh&amp;ker for this meeting for to allowallow faher aabba,;ih to be in Palestine is equiyalent to putting cheese before a mouse* The journey to Jaffa did not take place and uh.e man kli Dabbagh was not seen. As regards Taher Dabbagh’s risit to Aman t it is believed that Taher failed to get a visa from the French Consulate in Jerusalem to enable him to pass through ojria on his way to Baghdad, so he travelled in the mail convoy via Amman, where he arrived on the 19th and, after m&amp;Hng the usual pause for refuelling, proceeded on his journey within an hour of his arrival, the .fair himself was absent from Amman at the time and did not see him. 3. following on these-vents the Amir has i sued orders, at the request of dis Excellency the High ■Jommissioner, that the following nersons are to be excluded from Trans-Jordan:- ABDUL HAGUE dABBAH TaffiR DABSAGH HUSSBH DABBAGH AHMED ABDULLA AISHAN ABOUL mz 1L TaYIAH 03MAH KL ARAB In agreeing to issue this order the Amir has complained bitterly that men like Nebih el Azmeh, who was ejected fro® Trans-Jordan in 1924, are allowed to live in Palestine and sling mud at him in the papers. Locally collected information has tended to confirm the report received at Jecda that Ibn L&amp;oud intended to send ^khwan forces to his frontier with Trans-Jordan. His followers have been reported by Ibn o&amp;oud to be in a dangerous frame of mind and so hostile\1 ho 5 Ui. t„ t he l MuUrt th . t , he ^ ki _ ability to hold them in check, “ *°“ 11 “W” to th&gt; i °‘ r ; ,u of p * a “- th *‘ s ° b. .« * fr °- frontier, n.t it i. h . ld th . t a d.™.d to tU. end properlj be ^ ^ J..«d has .o, UMi Abdull-1 0{ r . spM , ibll . tj ^ [hb rohailion in isir; ho h„ off-r.i no proof, in sopport of this accusation. Fortunately, the latest information is to the effect that the concentration is not to approach the frontier and our Beduin may thus escape the alarms and the almost certain raids to which they would otherwise have been exposed. These rumours have also caused some alarm to the responsible officials of the Iraq Petroleum Company who haT ® 8 catt e r ed parties working along the pipe line. They hawe teen advised not to withdraw and a wireless has bten placed by the Hoyal Air force in one of the I,t * G * 0 !im P a *fcioh lies some 90 miles east of Azraq. 5 * 0n the 7t h December, Pis sxcellenoy the Sigh Oomaiiasioner flew to Amman and imnressed on the Amir the urgent need to hold himself entirely aloof from affairs and persons in Saoudi Arabia during the present difficult time. Sis excellency returned to Jerusalem after lunching with the Amir. '•&gt;’ An amendment to the Beiu Control Law has been drifted rtruviding that the Officer commanding the Arab Legion, or &amp;n officer appointed by him, shall have exclusive jurisdiction in dealing with raids in which foreign tribes are concerned, ant the remainder of its nowers and jursidiction will continue to be vested in tie Bedu Control Board. The measure will only bepassed „Hh dUfKmlt,, u th. ».ir ,111 disllk. It intensely* hbbas Hil*i ^asha, who arrived, at Haifa ob his yacht abo«t Christmas day, has writtan to the Aair saying that he has been told that it would be better if ha postpones his visit to Palestine and Trans-Jordan till a later date. He has also informed the Amir that this state of affairs will interfere with his acceptance of i'aisal's invitation to visit him in Baghdad. The Amir wished me to approach His Excellency with a view to obtaining permission for Abbas Hilmi to pass through «.h(' North of inns-Jordan, where the Amir would meet him, on is way to Iraq. The Amir was informed that it would be inadvisable to make any such request and was discouraged as well from visiting Abbas Hilmi in Haifa. His Highness, more in sorrow than in anger, has made it plain that he considers himself very badly treated. H. The Legislative Council adjourned for the month of Ramadan on the 26th and at the last meeting &amp; member, during the discussion of a proposal that the electoral Law should be changed so as to provide that a member ..hould be elected from Ma'an which at present is amalgamated with Kerak, proposed that the number of Christian members should be reduced. It appears probable that this proposal will be followed up when the Council reassembles in February and probable that the Christian members will be reduced from 3 to 2 and the Circassians from 2 to 1 ; the Moslems (other than Bedu) being increased correspondingly from 9 to 11 . 9.

There has been some raiding in the corridor by the Syrian Jebeleh on the Syrian Hualla who are grazing in Transjordan. The ..yrian Authorities do not apoear to be able to keep these Jebelieh in hand. The unfortunate Najid Pasha el Adwan, whose case has been before the Courts for so long, has apparently made his peace with the Amir so as to ensure that he is pardoned if found guilty, since the Amir called 0D his faU ‘ er » the Chief of the ndwan tribe, in the Jordan valley on the 15th. 12 * tlie Amir has informed me that he is negotiating “ ie loasr oi his land in the Jordan valley, an area of some 6 ;,OX) dunouma, to the Jews.

P u P T ON THij for the month n f Movfjmhsr . iy-t? un tile ard November, the Amir proposed that the move of the :3eni Atiya into Nejd should be postponed for a month, so that tftey might have time to send messengers ahead to make their peace with Ibn Saoud's officials. He was informed that it was believed that the move could not be completed inless than a fortnight, and this should provide the opportunity desired and, in consequence, no postponement could be agreed to. His Highness found this decision most displeasing. By the 5th November the Beni Atiya to be ejected had been moved eastward from the more difficult country of Kerak District into the open ground by the Hedjaz Railway. The move then continued southv/ard under the supervision of the .desert Police of the Arab Legion until the 11th when the tribesmen, having heard that some of their number, who had crossed near Mudawara had been raided, refused to proceed. By the 18th, however it was possible to get them on the move again and 110 tents (i.e.some 15b men, 200 women and 300 children! crossed the frontier on the 19th after a further 22 camels had been taken from them on account of fines inflicted on the raiders who had gone over in June and on account of blood money for the Arab Legionary who w as killed by those raiders. one hoped that, with the crossing of this party, one had heard the last of these v/retched people for a period but, unfortunately, the need has arisen for organising reliefrelief measures, lor a number of their starving women and children, whilst the Foreign Office have expressed fears of the schemes being prepared by Sheikh Selim Aby jjemeik. 2. Abdul Raouf Sabban, who returned from Palestine on tlie 14th, delayed unduly in Amman but finally took his departure for Baghdad on the 28th, where he has joined Sherif Sharaf and Mohamed Ali Bedeiwi under the protection of King Faisal. He was followed on the 29th by Hamid Pasha el Wady who had received an urgent telegram from his brother though there are rumours that he may not return. 3. On the 8th November the Amir with a retinue of some 30 people mounted on camels, which he had purchased for the purpose, set off to ride to a camp which had been selected a lew miles East of Asraq. Shaker, who regarded the undertaking as stupid extravagance, refused to accompany him. This excurison was I believe, harmless politically but may account for the suspicion in Saoudi circles of unusual activity in Trans-Jordan. On the 15th the Amir left his camp by car and fyas drove to Baghdad to see his elder brother Ali who/had a slight stroke. On the 23rd he arrived at his camp in the evening on his return journey and reached Amman before mid-day next morning. The Royal journeys and campings prove a great nuisance and expense to the members of the Amir’s Government and others who are anxious to gain his favour. For example the Executive Council had to drive the 80 miles to his camp in the Jesert to bid him farewell on the 15th. On the ^3rd they went to Azraq to meet him on his return but, as he had not arrived at 5.30 p.m.and the sun had sunk, they came back to Amman, His Highness arrived at 7.30 and being annoyedannoyed that no one was there to welcome him, ordered them out ap'fiia at 5.u a.m.the following morning to conauct him in to Amman. 4. The Amir has arranged that the Legislative council should re-open the question of having the 1928 Agreement betveen His Majesty and the Amir modified. I heard on the 15th that he had told his Chief Minister that if his Government could not arrange to have the Agreement modified it should resign, and that on the same day he summoned his former Chief Minister, Hassan Khalid Aboul Huda, to return to Trans-Jordan. This gentleman arrived on the 26th and it is said that the Amir wishes to make him Chief Minister. i he Chief Secretary, to save his bacon (far be it from him) is ready to agree with the Amir that the Chief Minister should be replaced and is busy thinking of the composition of the new Government, with himself in a prominent position. On the 21st the Legislative Council met in camera to discuss the Agreement and to hear the reading of tde letter whicn the Government had written to the Amir last year suggesting the modifications which might be made. A member named Adil el Asmeh who is the local head of the Hizb el Istiklal* and had been instructed by ^ing Faisal during his recent visit, said that no demand could succeed unless it was made with a united voice and that therefore, the Amir, his Government and the Legislative Council must all pull together. The Legislative Council approved of the GovernmentGovernment's former letter to the Amir and passed a resolution that a deputation should wait on the Amir and ask that he sh,:) uld a/rain put forvvard this same proposal for amenchemt. Un being informed that it was intended to present this request to His Excellency the High Commissioner at his forthcoming visit I protested saying that the document should be passed through me. Irslan, a prominent leader of the Hizb el Istixlal ana oi tire recent Jruze revolt in Syria having obtained permission to re-visit Palestine to see his aged mother has passed through Trans-Jordan, where he called on the Amir during tne halt of the post cars, on hisway to t Iraq where he will no doubt, discuss the affairs of the Party with a very important supporter. 6* The case of Sheikh Majid Pasha el Adwan (see Peport for May 1932) still remains before the Courts. It is said that, recently Sheikh Majid, at the Amir f s lent the latter ^?.100 and 480 sa ! as ox barley, request/whilst Shaker has received from the otner parties in the case a valuable piece of irritable land in the Jordan valley. 7• There is no indication that any person in Trans-Jordan is assisting the revolt in A sir or attempting to bring about trouble in Northern Hedjaz. The Amir, however, has been advised that he should hold no communication with persons in Saoudi Arabia. (SD) C.H.F.Cox.

Report for the month of October, 1932, on the political situation in Trans-Jordan by the British Resident, Amman. I (A copy of this Report has also been sent to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda).Bil- (§|) p 9 B 1 political SITUATION , for the month of OCTOBER r 1932. ^kat the Amir has been able to take the part he did in the Ibn Rafada affair and to come out of it unscathed, and apparently without any loss of fayour with His Majesty f 3 Oovernment, has had the effect of considerably adding to his influence. This has made the Grovernment afraid that their period of office may shortly be terminated and has made them much more ready to stand in with the Amir in anything he may wish to do, be it sound or not. The Amir has been planning the new Government and has even spoken of it to two of the British officials, but has not gone so far as to propose the change to the British Resident. 2. It has been previously reported that the Amir had attempted to send off the members of the Beni Atiya tribe, who were in Trans-Jordan, to fan the apark of rebellion in the Hedjaz but that owing to the timely arrival of the Officer Commanding the Desert p atrol, the main movement was prevented and only seme 80 persons crossed the frontier. In course of time the four leaders of this party were sentenced in absence to pay a fine of 10 camels each and to suffer a year f s imprisonment. Some 40 of the raiders who broke back into frans-Jordan were caught by the Police and sentenced^ Day a fine of one camel or undergo three months 1 imprisonment. TheThe remainder, not haring yet been captured, were still to be dealt with. Owing to the machinations of the Amir Shaker, with the knowledge, one may confidently assume, c£ the Amir none of the camels have been collected from the flocks of the leaders or their relatives, and the rank and file, who had been sentenced, were enabled to get out ol orison after having served a term of between four and six weeks. ihe sections oi the Beni Atiya concerned were naturally elated at their easy escape and it might be assumed that they and others like them would be ready to do the Amir f s bidding on any other occasion, beipg assured of virtual immunity from T&gt;unish?nent. It became, therefore, very necessary that the Beduin should be shown that this kind of obedience does not pay, and also very advisable to remove so dangerous an instrument from the Amir’s hands. It was, therefore, proposed that; (1) The fines already inflicted on the leaders be collected from them or their relatives up to the fifth degree. (2) That those who participated in the raid and had not already been tried should be tried at once, in presence or absence, and sentenced to a fine of not less than 2 camels which should be collected from their flocks or those of their relatives up to the fifth degree. (3) That all Beni Atiya who were not granted exemption by Captain G-lubb should be caused to leave the country by a certain date and that any found in Trans-Jordan after that date, unlessunless they had been granted exemption, should be sentenced to a line of £P.20 and imprisonment of one year. This decision was conveyed to the Amir on the morning of the ^8th and moved him profoundly. He agreed to whe first t^o conditions but said he could only agree to the third if it ware issued to the Beduin as an alternative, since it was beyond all reason to force these unfortunates into the hands of Ibn baoud f s underlings who would murder them and their families. On being presented the same evening with a letter from the Acting High Commissioner desiring him to cause the necessary orders to be issued and carried out, the Amir entirely caved in. The Amir is not a man who can be managed by kindness alone and it is hoped and believed that this may prove a useful lesson to him. On the following morning, the Amir proposed that he should send off a telegram, of which the translation is attached, and also enquired whether any ulterior motive was attributed to his forthcoming journey into the Eastern Desert, he added that if that were so he would unhesitatingly abandon the proposed journey. 3. The Amir, who was informed by His excellency the High Commissioner on the 6th October of the repor t lhat the Amir and J?aisal were assisting preparation tor a further rising in the Hedjaz, was warned of the serious consequences of any such enterprise* The Amir expressed pain and surprise that anyone should suspect him and said that having promised to recognise Ibn Saoud and being a man of honour he could not now act as Ibn Saoud's enemy, ft Be certain that I will keep my word, he said, and don’t lendJ ^ lend your ears to tales which describe m as untruthful”. Ee told His ^xceliency that it must be recognised that Ibn Saoud has many enemies and assured him that should any plot be hatched against Ibn oaoud the Amir would be no more to blame for it than His Excellency hittelf. 4. Abdul daouf dab an, who had left for dgypt, re ap neared in Amman on the 17th, the Authorities in Egypt having refused to allow him to remain. oheikh Euad el Khatib was sent to ask the British Residents advice as to his disposal and it was finally arranged that he should proceed to Palestine for 10 days to undergo dental treatment and should then go to f Iraq. He left Amman on the 21st. 5 # The Amir and his Oovernment having finally taken their stand in opposition to the recently formed Society for improving the condition of the workingman, the dociety has failed to cause unrest amongst the employees of the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Company has looked after their locally engaged labourers very well and has assisted the Government by recruiting its labour, in the main from the distressed areas. This additional means of earning a livelihood in this very lean year has proved a God send. The work of the Iraq Petroleum Company has proceeded apace and. without hindrance frcai the people or the Government; there have been one or two scares oi shooting, but these have proved unfounded. It has been provisionally agreed that the establishment oi the Desert Police shall be increased by 83 men, on a permanent basis for the protection of the pipe line and pumping stations. As the men to be employed will mainly be Beduin ^ aa stabilising element of considerable value will thus have been introduced amongst the tribesmen. 6 * The west ward mail from Iraq will be carried by Haim Nathaniel's care on the Trans-Jordan route for the first time on November the first and thereafter twice weekly. It is anticipated that the Persian mail will be added to this as from the 1st January next. £P.300 of the money voted for Beduin relief works will be spent on improving the 40 kilometres of road which traverses the lava belt east of Azraq. 7 * It is a very great pity that the Middlesex Regim nt, to whom he was attached for so short a time in Jerusalem, were unwilling to put up with the minor idiosyncracies of the Amir Talal and complete the task they had unttertaken. The Amir Talal would be much better away from the Palace and knows it and is only too anxious to escape, but it is impossible to arrange locally for more a than a respite of day or two here and there. ✓&gt;&gt; 8. The operation of the Law regarding the Division of Taxes in the Kerak District which was anacted during the last Session of the Legislative Council is proceeding satisfactorily. There was a great deal of propaganda against this Law amongst the more influential classes, since the Law requires them to bear a fair share of the taxation, but this has died down. 9. The Amir and his two sons proceeded to Jerusalem on the 14th to lay a piece of carpet from the shrine at Mecca on the tomb of the late King Hussein. 10. The Senior Judicial Council has sentenced the Judge referred to in the penultimate paragraph of my report for September to be reduced in grade, but the Amir has not, asHis Majesty King Abdul Aziz A1 uaoud. Out of regard for public security and in the interest of peace on the frontiers, we have decided to issue our orders that Beni Atiya should depart to your illustrious Kingdom after the trial and punishment of the culprits amingst them. I hope that these persons will obtain your magnanimous pardon and forgiveness in response to our request and intention to co-operate in the maintenance of peace and-nrder.ia anr respegtiTa Qn uptfies (and in respect of your legitimate rights, trusting that this hope would be favourably met).I 1 B ' 12 b Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— llowing number quoted ff , Reference to previous correspondence: 6^4^ Letter the Colonial Office of the Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

On the 2nd September the Imperial forces, which had been concentrated in the South of irans-Jordan in connection with Ibn Rafada, dispersed to their peaoe stations; at the same time the Prohibited Sone was abolished and the restrictions on the movement of food stuffs to the Kedjax and $ejd were removed. 2. On the 4th the dispersal of the refugees who were detained and were being fed at Government expense was commenced; those detained at Ma f an were released from there, whilst those of Ibn Rafada’s party who were at Aqaba were moved North to Ma*an before be ng set at liberty. By the 10th the dispersal was completed. 3. fhe main part of the Beni Atiya raiders, who had crossed into the Kedjas on the 26th June, were still some 20 miles South of the frontier at a place called ALaGAM; these were attacked by a party of Beduin acting under Nejd Government’s instructions about the 11th and are said to have lost 6 men killed and some 30 camels. fhe four leaders of the Beni *tiya raiding party, who were concerned in the death of the Arab Legionary near Jebel Rum, have been sentenced in absence by the Bedu Control Board to a year*, iaprisonaont and a fine of 10 camels each, the SBOOf section from which these men come have been sentenced to pay as blood money to the relatives of the deceased soldier a sum of £P:182.450 mils.U 4. A certain Abdulla el Arair, who wae formerly of the entourage of the Amir Shaker and who went to the northern Hedja* after the defeat of Ibn Rafada, wae the cause for some anxiety as his intentions were obscure; he has now returned to Amman. 5. Abdul Raouf Sabban towards the end of the month left frans-Jordan for iigypt and will not, it is said, return. 6. rwo Reni Atiya caravans of 90 and 75 persons respectively were at the end of the month seeking authority from the Governor of Xebuk to enter the Hedjaz. 7. On the 1st beptember His iSxcellenoy the High Commissioner flew to Amman and obtained an unconditional promise from the Amir that he would recognise Ibn baoud as King of the Kedjas. ihe Amir, to whom it had been explained that recognition and a treaty of friendship were two independent subjects, said that he had always regarded them as bound up together, and that although he was quite ready indeference to His isajeety's (j-ov'rument 1 s wishes to regard them as separate, he felt that mere recognition by him of Ibn baoud would not produce the good result Hie Excellency looked for, whare ts a ireaty of friendship whioh prorided for the autual recognition of the two Rulers and for the recognition of the southern frontier of rrans-Jordan might well bring a real and lasting benefit* At the end of this interview His Abcoellenoy accepted the Amir's invitation to visit him in his camp in northern Iraus-Jordan and after inspecting the forward tease of the Iraq Petroleum Company at iiafrak Hie Excellency joined the amir in hie camp on the10 . 3&gt; 8. ihe UgiBlative Oounoll, which had aBBembl*^ on the *9th au fc ^Bt in Extraordinary Session to deal with the 19o2/33 Eetimatee and three other laws, decided withoiit any hesitation to reject the Sharia Eourt fees Law irom which an added annual rerenue of some £P: 1.000 had been hoped for. 1'hey were also reported to have decided to refuse any law which prowl dee for an increase of fees or taxation, to demand the modification of the Agreement of 1928, the setting up of a weaponsitie form of Government, the reduction of taxes, the ejection of foreign officials, and were said to have decided on a refusal to do way with the Magistrate's Jourt at fafileh and to do away with the Public . roeeoutors and repl i.ce them by Police who have been under training for the purpose# 9# During the &lt;14 hours His Sxoellenoy spent in the Amir’s camp, the Amir held forth at length on the dangers oi allowing the Arab Independence Party to raise its head and gave the names of the following as important men in the Party;- hi ad ee £ulh and thukri Kowatli of bfRlA Kami 1 Kassah of PaL^XIHjS Sheikh Kashid K1 dha of jfiGfPX Rustum Haider and Xahsin Kadri of IRA** TJusef Yasi n and tfuad Hamsa of KiJD Adil Irelan When asked about the attitude of the Legislative Council and the prospects of the acceptance of the Land Tax Law next Session, the Amir said he must gauge the strength of his Government before deciding what should be done. He said a modification of the Agreement was most desirable, but was told that this oould not be considered at present in view of recent happenings.10. On the 11th King Faleal arrived from Iraq and when I called on him in the afternoon asked me who had been running the Ibn Hafada movement. I i:oid him it had been most unwise of the Amir to keep people about him who were so plainly interested. On the 16th the King returned my call and told me that the Amir had promised him that in future he would confine his attention to frans-Jordan, Faisal said that before he left he would get the Amir to put thie in writing and would show it to me (this has not been done). He said he h*»d studied the 1928 Agreement during hie present visit and found it so severe that Abdullah was merely an official of the Mandatory Power; he strongly advocated that it should be changed and argued that Abdullah with more liberty would take a livelier interest in irans- Jordan and thus be less interested in things outside his territory. 11. During hie st^y in irans-Jordan the King met a number of promi nent members of the Arab Independence Party from Palestine and Syria and is said to have discussed the plans of the Arab Jongress which is to take place in Baghdad and also the Monarchy in Syria. He is also said to have sounded some prominent Trans- Jordanians as to the feeling of the people towards Abdullah and to have assured them that the Amir's attitude would improve. 12. The Estimates were dealt with by the Legislative uounoil on three days and in the intervale steps were taken to shepherd opinion as much as porsible to the side of the Government. On the 1-th the Estimates were passed with only one important amendment, namely the retention of the Public Prosecutors and the Jourt at lafileh. 13.13• On the 19th a p^rty of Jews, who had driven to £e-fcalt and lunched there, were atoned by a crowd compoBed mainly of boye, they drove on to Amiran and reported the cape to ihe Officer Commanding the Arab Legion who accompanied them back through as-3alt and arranged for their safety as far as the bridge into Palestine, a number of boys have been thrashed and eome young men, who are believed to be the instigators, have been passed to the Courts, 14. Mng Pal sal left for Baghdad on the 21st by Imperial airways machine which landed at berka to pick him up. fhe Amir was amused to see His Majesty enter the machine which was full of luggage and had a number of other passengers already seated, the Amir compared him to a man going for a ride in a tram. 15. On the following day the Amir was the guest of the admiral at lunch on board H.M.S. ^ueen Elizabeth. 16. rhrae Syrians have been in prison in Amman awaiting extradition for some three months on a charge of shooting at the car of a deputy and killing the chauffeur. On the 27th the President of the Court of Pirst Instance in Amman, sitting as a Magistrate, ordered the release of these men, since the papers demanding their extradition had not arrived. Knowing that the demand for extradition had been sent off the men were re-arreeted immediately they left the prison. ihis caused some excitement in the tewn andanumber of shops were shut. Meantime it was ascertained that the Amir’s Irade, which had been issued in June, ordered the detention of the accused until the arrival of the papers and that therefore the Magistrate was doubly to blame in ordering the release. Onbeing informed by the Judicial Adviser that his duty was clear when the men were broughtbrought before him ain the magistrate was insulting and is to be brought before a Counoil of Discipllns. 1/. With reference to page 3 of my Report of July, the Amir has now caused Mohamad -uain Shanqiti to be pardo ned. C. H. F.

The police managed to capture one of the raiders’ camels and the names of the persons composing the party have now been ascertained. Some 25 of the raiders who returned without their loot have been caught and the terms have been offered to the remainder with the exception of those who fired on the police. It is doubtful that these terms will be accepted now since the main Akhwan forces have moved off to the South. 2. Following on the defeat of Ibn Rafada’s party by Government forces at the end of July a good deal of rather indiscriminate killing was indulged inby these forces. Refugees began to filter into Trans-Jordan and by the end of the month the total of these apprehended reached 143. It has been difficult to pick out from these those men who formed part of Ibn Rafada’s band, but 43 can definitely be said to be ex-rebels. They are a miserable rabble. Those who sent so many of these poor « wretches to their death on the promise of a handful of flour a day (and even that was not forthcoming) should feel some remorse, but probably prefer to regard their victims as fiery patriots who sacrificed their lives in their enthusiasm for a noble cause.3. On the 5th August the Amir Shaker, who had gone to Bag! dad at the summons of King Faisal, returned haring been desired by the King to prevail upon the Amir Abdullah to abandon his hostile attitude to Ibn Saoud and to conclude with him a treaty of friendship. On the 6th the Amir informed me that he was ready to recognise Ibn Saoud and conclude a treaty of friendship with him if His Majesty's Government really attached importance to his doing so, but on condition that the Amir should be allowed to perform the pilgrimage and should be allowed to appoint an agent to look after the Hashimite properties in the Hedjaz. I am told that there is no doubt that the money for the Revolution was provided by Abbas Hilmi who promised the Amir Abdullah as much as £100,000, that he has actually paid out £30,000, of which half was spent on the Revolution and half stolen by Hamid Pasha el Wadi and Abdul Raouf Sabban between them. II is stated that the Amir Talal who visited Gaiio, aocorapanied by Hamid Pasha el Wadi, on the 13th August, negotiated with Sherif Ali Pasha, as to a further attempt in three months 1 time, but the late attempt has proved so thorough a failure that another after so short an interval would seem unlikely. The Amir who has pretended to believe and done his best to convince others, by causing articles to be written in the mewspapers and by other means, that Ibn Rafada was not killed when the rebels were defeated has fallen foul of the Hizb el Istiklal, which has raised its head again in Palestine, and has blamed the Amir for his share in the attack on Ibn Saoud’s authority. Abdullah is most desirous that the High Commissioner should pull kis chestnuts out of the fire by breaking up the Hizbel IstiklalIstiklal and hints that if His Excellency does not do so'' he will seek a means of coming to agreement with the party 7. Discussions on the Bon Voisinage Agreement Between Syria and the Jewel Druse and Trans-Jordan have no been opened, so the new frontier has not yet been brought into force. 8. oince Sultan Pasha el Atrash left Haditha for Kerak, where he is now living, the Nejdian Goverment have lodged a number of protests against reprssentatives of the Trans-Jordan Government visiting Haditha which they maintain is in Nejd. The Director of Surveys has now taken the necessary observations and reported that Haditha is in Nejdian territory. At the same time he took the opportunity of verifying the position of Hazim which is clearly within Trans-Jordan. Rikabi Paeha, who was Chief Minister in Trans- Jordan during 1934 and 1935, anpeared in Amman on the 9th August at the call of the Amir who probably wished to make him Chief Minister instead of Sheikh Abdulla Sirai. It was necessary to make it clear that such an appointment was regarded as impossible. 10. Many of the influential men in Kerak are much annoyed at the new system of apportionment of taxes which is in operation this year for the first time; this arrangement causes every man to pay according to the productivity of his land. Petitions have been submitted to the Amir and to the Government. Counter petitions havs been submitted by the large, but less powerful, majority who favour the new division. 11* A Mazbata, signed by a number of prominent men which makes the following demands, has been presented to thethe Amir (1) rhe annulment of the Agreement between His Majesty's Government and His Highness the Amir and the negotiations of another in replacement ( 2 ) (3) (4) (5) The introduction of Responsible Government.

The Amir f s attitude was described to me early in the month by a member of his staff as very excitable and as manifesting a burning desire to get back to the Hejaz, this official complained that he was having a difficult time in keeping him on the rails. On the 7th His Excellency the High Commissioner flew from the aerodrome which serves Jerusalem to Amman to impress upon the Amir the urgent need for following the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the situation in the Hedjaz and to inform him that he would be held responsible for his brother Ali who was his guest. In the monthly report for June it was mentioned that Mohamad el ssad, the Mudir of Aqaba, had been discharged; it has since come to light that Ibn Bafada on his way through Trans-Jordan slept a night in the house of this official. It has already been reported that the amir had told the Mayor of Amman that he should arrange to have the Eroclaraations of His Excellency the High Commissioner, which had been posted in prominent places in the town, pulled down. The high official who informed me of this now states that the story has been retailed to him by, - each of the three persons who were present when the Amir gave the order. On the 13th of July a car of the Desert Patrol, Which was following up 80!ne fresh tracks which had been ' made near Bair fort during the night was ambushed within a couple of miles of the fort and two policemen were wounded. An aeroplane at once took out Captain Northfield of the Arab Legion, but the aggressors could not be found. The wounded were ewacuated by air. Careful enquiries hare been made into this incident and there is rery good reason to believe that the attackers were a party of men from Amman led by a man who deserted Ibn ■jaoud and attached himself to the Amir, during Hr Mac Donnell's investigations. It is believed that these people were taking letters or messages into the Hedjaz. On the 14th Mohamed el Assad, whose wife was still at Aqaba and Sherif Mohamed Ali Bedeiwi, who in earlier days was an Administrative official of the Trans- Jordan Government under the Amir Abdullah and who had recently come up from Egypt and was said to be on his way to the Hedjaz, were searched on arrival in Ma'an. Nothing incriminating was found and Sherif Mohamed Ali who was detained for some days has now left for Syria. On the 20th of July an order was obtained from the Court to search the mail which had left Amnan on the arrival of the train in Ma'an. Nothing incriminating was found. On the 17th of July the General Arab Council, which seems to be in the focus in Jerusalem for the Hizb e l Istiklal, issued a manifesto abusing the Mandatory PowerPower and the Amir for supporting Ibn Rafada against Ibn Saoud. fliia Hi zb el Istiklal is regarded here as a party of considerable potential danger and 6 prominent members thereof were turned out of Trans-Jordan in 1924. Of these the following four are now in Palestine:- NEBIH EL km, HI UK PASHA, SAMI SARRAJ, ADIL ARSLAS. The Amir on reading this manifesto telephoned to Haj Amin el Husseini, the Head of the Supreme Moslim Council in Jerusalem, and informed him that if these were his sentiments the amir wanted nothing further to do with him. on the 2a th July the Amir Shaker left Amman for Baghdad in answer to a summons from King Paisal - it is stated locally that Faisal wishes to persuade Shaker to influence the Amir to the end that he should behare sensibly towards Ibn baoud. On the 24th Jedda reported that the 70 Beni Atiya, who crossed the frontier on the 26th June, had looted oetween 72u and 1200 camels and were driving them back to Trans-Jordan. There has been no sign of these so far and the Amir declares that the Beni Atiya in question have joined the garrison of Teima. On the other hand, a matter of 15 camels have been seized from a couple of Atoon who set off from Trans-Jordan shortly after the Beni Atiya P a rty had left for the Hedjaz on the 26th June. The Amir has been telling various people, and amongst them Hussein el Tarawneh the Head of the Arab Executive Committee, to encourage the people to protest against the manifesto of the General Arab Council, the or hibition against export foodstuffs to the Hedjaz and ^ejd and the formation of the prohibited area. Hussein el Tarawneh asked the advice of Adil el Azmeh, the locallocal leader of the hizb el Istiklal, and was told to have nothing to do with it and warned that in all probability the Amir had been prompted to make the suggestion by the British Resident. There has been a serious quarrel between the Amir and the two senior members of his Oovernment. The occasion was che binding over to be of good behaviour of a man named Shanqiti who is the son of one of the Ami^s friends and who has been working against the Government and writing in favour of the Ibn Rafada movement. The Amir wished to protect him. This, however, was merely the culmination of a series of incidents in which the Government had failed to cooperate with the Amir in his support of Ibn Rafada. The Amir wished to make a change of Chief Minister and other members of the Government. I told him that this could not be agreed to as the Mandatory Power had confidence in the present Government which was supporting him as Amir of Trans-Jordan and that the Mandatory p ower could not run the risk of having another Government of doubtful politics in circumstances as doubtful and delicate as the present. After this the Amir caved in and the necessary reconciliation has been effected. Amongst the work which Shanqiti is believed to have done for the Amir was the composition and despatch of the follow!ag telegram to the address of the British Resident:- 'le who are gathered protest against the interference of the English in the midst of Moslem Ranks and the demonstration of siding with Ibn Saoud with the intention of penetrating into the f Sacred country which hastas *i»» rise t, hidden pain, in the hearts of Arab, Mid ^ ^ put a stop to this interference”. It is certiin that this telegran was published m the local paper at the command of the Amir. It has been discorered that a man who is a personal employee of the Amir has sent constable sums of money to a certain Hussein el Dabbagh in Aden and that this latter was in / wan 6 months ago and in 1923 was accountant of the Amir's Palace, it is known that ■assaoud Dabbagh who has lived in faman under the Amir's protection for a long time joined Ibn Rafada some 30 days with iCP.30) in his pockst* rhere seems to be little doubt that His Ixoellency the High Commissioner's conversation with the Amir has had no great effect. That ooinion at any rate is held by the senior native officer of the Arab Legion and the leading native civil officials have informed me that the Amir is actively engaged in supporting Ibn Bafada. ‘he mir's present line of conduct is having a mosi, detrimental effect on the general situation. New parties are being formed and are holding meetings, abd Government, authority has in general been weakened. 3* fhe Amir has also been engaged during the last few weeks in belittling his elder son Talal and in increasing the importance of his second son Naif. feeling between Moslems and Christians, although better, still runs high and on the evening of the Prophet's birthday a crowd marched from the town to the Amir's Palace praising the sword of Islam and demanded the pardon of the man who had murdered the Christian prisoner, referred to in my previous report.

I aave the honour to transmit to you, for your infomation, the papers noted below on the subject of the political situation in Ifans-Jordan. I have etc., (Sd) Arthur Wauchope. nigh Commissioner for Transjordan. His Majesty's principal Secretary of state for the Colonies. Report for the month of June on the political situation in Trans-Jordan by the British Resident .Amman. (.Copy of this Report has been forwarded to His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah).fKCRE.I 1. In the last monthly report It was stated tnat, a party of riedjazi tribesmen having passed through Trans-Jordan on the 21st May and having put it about that they were expecting money .arms and provisions from the Amir Abdullah, His Highness issued the following order on the 26th May;- ' 11 . nas come to my ears ( from the British Resident) that a number of tribesmen without their women and children, having passed through southern Trans-Jordan and are assembled south of Aqaba under the leadership of Hamid Ibn Rafada. It is said that these people expect help from me for some evil purpose in the Hedjaz. i order you to cause these people to return to their families in Sinai, Palestine or Trans-Jordan and to prevent the passage through Trans-Jordan of any persons whose movements give cause for suspicion that their intentions are not wholly peaceful'. On the 27th the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion flew to Aqaba and Ibn Rafada, alarmed by the order sent him to come in, moved off southwards as far as Haikl. The importance of preventing the Beni Atiya and southern Trans-Jordan tribes from moving into the Hedjaz was realised and precautions were taken to the end that they should not do so. On the 1st June His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah telegraphed tnat the Hedjaz Government requestedundertaking from the British Government tV-K-ll-P 3 requested an ^uverume: on its ova behalt and on tenalf or Trans-Jordan to prevent the entry or any •criminals. Into Irans-Jordan Tney also asKed lor a similar undertaklns lor the immediate surrender ol any -criminals- .ho have participated In tnese evil actions end have lied to Trans-Jordan. In reply His Majesty's Minister was instructed to inform the Hedjazi-Nejdi Government that it is not physically possible to close the whole frontier. The prevention of rebels escaping from the hedjaz must rest with Hedjazi-Nejdi Government but the entry of Hedjazi forces into Trans-Jordan could not be permitted. But all steps would be taken to assist the hedjazi Authorities and any fugitive rebels entering xrans-Jordan would, as far as possible, be disarmed and removed from the frontier to a place of safety. Further, that it is impossible to guarantee the surrender of any rebel leaders who may escapeinto Trans-Jordan territory, but that every possible effort would be made to prevent such persons from giving further trouble to the Hedjaz-Nejd Government. As it was believed that the most effective means of putting an end to any concentration near the irans-Jordan southern boundary would be to prevent supplies leaving Trans-Jordan for the rebels the Amir was desired, on the 8th of June, to cause effective nieasures to be taken to this end. On the 10th it was decided that Captain Glubb with such part of his Desert Patrol as might be necessarynecessary should be taken away from the Important duty of enumerating the Beduin animals on which he was engaged and put in charge of the southern area so that the order to prevent the passage to the Hedjaz of men and supplies might be effectively prevented. The Amir explained that if the rebel coiice itration was at a considerable distance from the frontier it would be a physical impossibility for them to obtain supplies from Trans- Jordan and he tnercxore suggests that he should send a message to Itn Kafada tnat he should move off southwards. This suggestion was not accepted.* On the 13th June as it appeared that the Police unaided were unable to prevent the filtration across Trans-Jordan of men going into the Hedjaz or to prevent the movement of supplies from Trans-Jordan to ti*e i ebels it was decided to re-enforce them by detachments of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force at Rum, 1 itn and Aqaba with a flight of aeroplanes at Ma’an, and a law was enacted totally prohibiting the export of food stuffs to the Hedjaz and Nejd. On the 15th June H.M. S. 'penzance' arrived at Aqaba to render assistance, should it be required and remained there till the 28th when she moved to Tor in the gulf of Suez to prevent native craft carrying supplies to the rebels from Egypt. On the 17th June His Excellency the High Commissioner, accompanied by the Air Officer Commanding,the Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force.-orce the Chief secretary ,f the Palestine Qovernment the Commandant of the Palestine Police ana ttle 0IfiC£r ' Companding tne Arab Legion, flew to Aqaba. The support of the Imperial Forces'enabled a much latter control of the movement of men and supplies to be exercised and a number of returning Hedjasls coming from Palestine were arrested and turned back. On the 13th June Lieutenant-Colonel Peake took over from Captain Glubb who came up to Ziza in order to count the animals of the Beni S akhr which had been ordered to collect for that purpose some weeks before. On the evening of the 20th a messenger from the pol ice he had left in the area where the Beni Atiya were camped reached Captain Glubb at Ziza and infomed him that the 'em Atiya were sending off parties to the Hedjaz. On arriving in the Kerak District Captain Glubb was greeted by Beni Atiya and Howeitat Sheikhs who wished the enterprise success and in some cases informed him that their sons nad gone off. On being roundly abused they infomed him that they had the authority of the Amir for joining n been told that the movement had the blessing of the British Government and that Captain Glubb • c head to Aqaba to arrange matters and would hand acid to ohose joining as in the happy days of Lawrence. Having impressed the truth upon them messengers and P0xu.ce were sent out in all directions and Captain Glubb bu...oelf moved that night to the frontier. One party of about 70 were met by a police patrol wo men from Medawara but refused to obey their order to ^ Urn moved across into the Hedjaz* It is generally believed that this move of the e duin which was of considerable magnitude was arranged by the AmirAmir. The timely arrival of Captain Glubb. however, enabled it to be largely nullified and it is believed that not more than 80 Beni Atiya and Howeitat crossed into Nejd* Three Sheikhs have so far been put in prison and some 200 camels have been impounded. Following on this a detachment of Frontier Force were placed at Medawara Fort as s re * enforc ement and an area bounded on the south by the southern frontier and on the north by a line roughly 30 miles to the north has been declared closed and anyone found therein without a permit signed by the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion is liable to be fired upon. A Proclamation to this effect was issued by the Amir on the 2nd July and an Ordinance giving the necessary authority was enacted on the saine day. On the same day a Proclamation by His Excellency the High Commissioner was v/idely distributed declaring that the Mandatory Power continues in its determination that no assistance shall be given from or through Trans-Jordan to those who are in opposition to the Government of the Hedjaz and Hejd and that the Imperial Ecrces have been ordered to take all necessary measures in conjunction with the Arab Legion to enforce this decision. Colonel Peake will remain in charge in the south and Captain: Glubb with the Desert Patrol will be free to move about among the Trans-Jordan tribes as a precaution that no other surprise is sprung upon us, Qn the 22nd it was discovered that the Mudir of Aqaba was in Amman though he should have been at his post in Aqaba and it was discovered that he had accompaniedaccompanied a certain Alawi el Kabariti of Suez, who is t. ! -e main intermediary in forwarding money and supplies to the rebels, from Amman to Aqaba and back on the 16th, 17th and 18th, The Amir agreed that he should be discharged as from 1st July 1932 and in the meantime be prohibited from returning to Aqaba. He has since resigned, 2. The delimitation of the Northern frontier in conjunction with the French and Syrian Representatives commenced on the 6th June and by the 20th that part of it which lies between the road from Remthe to Deraa and the edge of the lava belt (the Karrat el Radjil) w'hich lies south-east of the Jebel Druze v/as marked. Between the 21st and the 25th the section between the Remthe-Deraa road and the junction of the Palestine, Syrian and Trans-Jordan frontier near el Hammeh station v/as marked out and on the 29th the Commission proceeded to Jebel Tenf to demarcate the remaining section from there to the eastern edge of the lava. The lava belt itself is almost impenetrable and it is not proposed to place any marks therein. The triangulation of the area between Jebel Tenf and the Jebel Druze which commenced about the 1st June v/as completed about the 23rd. The country v/as exceedingly difficult and the weather very trying, 3. It being evident that the Legislative Council were not prepared to pass the Land Tax Law, 1932, the Law was not put to the vote and the instructions of His Sxcellency the High Commissioner have been sought as to the line of action to be taken if the law, when placed before the Legislative Council next November, is rejected. InV9 In the meantime the Legislative Council hav a law which provides in the lands of r ! ' and of the le “ H ' s »” r ' '•« of 11 oi tne present accordance with the valuation recerti t hf&gt; r + , ecently completed,amongst the reputed owners of land. This will distribute fin tribute the present tax fairly and shoul ensure better collector, j boon th « cultivators. a. s ,„ lm of the leslsiativc which h.d h«„ r „ „ ? ^ ».hle .«iti.» u » a „ gent to ^ aeiit &gt;it ^ terminated on the 14 th, Sultan Pasha el Atrash has been informed. through th e Ajnir ’ that he and imnediate followers may live in Trans-Jordan not further north than Kerah provided he sign and undertaking on his and their behalf not to take part i politics either here or in neighbouring countries. On the evening of the 21st a Christian youth Wadie Dagher, who was walking with a Moslem woman in the new quarter which is built on the hill overlooking the old tow of Amman, was cal lad to account by a Moslem youth Paris el Anis Abu Ragheb who abused him for being with a Moslem woman. Angry words were exchanged and finally Wadie shot and seriou sly wounded Paris. Hews was given to the police Tc-:at had happened and to Paris's brother Hamdi el Anis Abu Ragheb who joined the angry crowd which awaited the arrival of Wadie outside the Police Station. Wadie was brought through this crowd towards the Police Station and as he approached the door was shot dead by Hamdi who then ran off through the crowd. As Hamdi ran past the Ottoman BankBank the policeman on duty there came into the road and, in spite of Hamdi’s warning to him to keep off, attempted to seize him. Hamdi fired and killed him and made good his escape. This has occasioned serious ill-feeling between the Moslems and Christians and when Faris died on the 25th his funeral was attended by a large crowd,and the shops were closed. The Amir has been asked to pardon Hamdi but, as advised by the Executive Council, has replied that it is quite impossible as the facts of the case are not yet known. On the same day another murder took place in Ariman and a fifth person was killed on the 27th. On the 9th of June the Amir and the British 7 Resident attended the ceremony at Jisr Mej ami eh when His Excellency the High Commissioner started the turbines which produce the electric energy for Palestine. Trans-Jordan welcomed its first resident Bishop 8 . in the person of Mgr.Boulos Salman of the Greek Cathoxic Church on the 22nd. 9. On the 23rd ex King All arrived by air from Baghdad on his annual summer visit. 10. A Mr.Sutherland, who was the holder of permits to explore for oil which have just expired,has applied j for further permits in the vicinity of the Dead Sea both in Palestine and Trans-Jordan. He is financed by Abbas Hilmi Pasha the ex-Khedive. (Sgd) C.H.E. Cox BRITISH RESIDENT. 4th July,1932CQgg .

ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO. *29 21 JUU »32 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT, INDIA OFFICEon Tim &amp;F,, ^ montn of Uav. laa^, 1 . A survey of the crops and of the economic state of the whole of Trans-Jordan, which had been undertaken by the Assistant British Resident and the financial Adviser, was completed by toe middle of ay. Generally the conclusions reached are that &amp; general crop failure has been missed by a very narrow margin and that even as it is, the forthcoming season will not be one of prosperity* In certain areas relief must be giren in the form of remission of taxes and it is anticipated that a considerable proportion of the not fully secured loans which were issued this year will be irrecoverable* In addition it will be necessary to issue seed loans, either in money or in kind, to some 300 families in the N&amp;hiyeh of Araq # to one or two villages in the Taflleh qadha and to the people of ^hobek* As regards the Bedu it is estimated that approximately two hundred families are in a state of complete destitution, that is to say they are dependent for their existence on charity and assistance from the Government* This does not Include families reduced to poverty but which still have some means of support* A sum of £P*6000 is necessary to provide thesetaufl&amp;i&lt;+ these deetitute familiee with a sufficient number of animais to enabXe them to maintain them* el yes without assistance in future. The alternatiy of maintaining then on charity is no real solution of the difficulty. 2. The combined survey of the Syrian.Transjordan frontier commenced on the 5th of May. The French hare proved exceedingly obliging over this matter and the personnel furnished by Transjordan consists of one British (lent by the Palestine Government) and one native official only. The area to be surveyed has proved difficult of triangulation and the heat and difficulty in regard to water have made conditions very trying. The Assistant British Resident, who will be the Chief Commissioner of the Trans jordan part of the Delimitation Comraission, proceeded to Beirut on th* 25th and returned on the 29th having arranged that the delimitation of the boundary should begin on the 6 th June starting with the section to the South of the Jebel Druse. c. The survey of the Trans jordan/Iraq frontier sone has been carried out by an Iraq Survey party and a formula defining the boundary has been agreed upon* 4. On the evening of the 6 th May a shooting afjfcy took place in the Jordan valley between the eldeet son of the Sheikh of the Adwan tribe and his party and a half brother together with hi a party. Three men were killed. It was the Adwan tribe which revolted against the Amir in 1923 and marched on Amman and the enmity between the Sheikh with his eldest son and the step brother- WITH! brother Mentioned above hae been kept ali T . by to , Amir. The 3 helkh and hi. eide.t eon have been doing their best to have the oaan *_4 .j v wie oaee tried by the iieduin Control Board. The oa.e, however, is not the jurisdiction of too Bedu Control Board since the Adwan tribe are not nomads and His iixeellency the High omral.jaioner, to whoa the matter was referred,has decided that it would be inadvisable to allow the Law to be changed so as to give the Bedu Control Board jurisdiction over non-nomad Bedu in general or in this particular case. This decision was com-mwicated to the Amir on the 24th, but the Amir has not yet given up hope of haring it arranged otherwise, sn arguing this case I had occasion to inf ora the Chief Secretary that Article 6 of the Agreement gare the Mandatory Power rery wide powers in the supervision 01 the conduct of affaire in Transjordan. This official at the time was inclined to argue hut informed me three days later that he iUlly concurred and that in his opinion the time had come to consider the changes necessary in the Organic Law to limit the powers of the Legislative Council. 5. two criminals, who were sentenced in absence o 15 years and years respectively, approached the ^mir and solicited hia pardon# The Amir sent for the Public Prosecutor General and was informed by the latter that the men being fugitives from justice must surrender an(i be tried again before their pardon could be considered. TheThe Amir then told the men to gire themeeW up saying that If on their re-trlal they were acquitted well and good, hut that If they were sentenced to imprisonment, he would pardon them, The men aim-rendered and after re-trlal were sentenced to 16 years and T* years imprisonment reopoctiTely* me Amir, believing thatthe men would be acquitted and that the Public Prosecutor General has deceived him, is angry with the latter and, to put him into iificultiee, is pressing the members of the ■ omnittee which, under the Law, is responsible for the discharge of non-Trans-Jordanian officials, and of which the Public Prosecutor General is President, to call on the President to re-assemble them to proceed to the discharge of these officials. I have been obliged to ask the Amir to desist in his efforts to have the ommittee reiorraed as this is in opposition to the arrangement made in agreement with him and referred to in my report for January and February. 6 . The Amir has written to Rikabl Pasha, who was Chief Minister in Tr&amp;ne-Jordon in 1924 and 1925, asking him to come back* To allow the return of the Pasha would be impossible for many reasons of which one is that he and the Amir would very shortly return to the basis, on which they parted early in 1926, of hating each other so heartily that everything else was subordinate to the aim of doing each other ham. ?« For some time it had been suspected that a movement was afoot to make trouble for the Authorities in the Hedjas. On the 21st it was reported that 250 men, mainly of the Billl, had come from Sinai and, passingpAMing to the north of Aqaba, war, a a8eBbled la Hodja* territory at a point ooa.

Ae i'ollo./ing order wa. i. au ,d by the Aair on the 36th:- 'It ha. come to my ear. (from the Brltiah Re.ident) that a number of trib.emen, without their children and women, hare pa.sed through southern Trans- Jor and are aaeembled south of Aqaba under the leaderahip of Kamid Ibn Rafadah. It i. .aid that these people expect help from me for .one eril purpose in the Kedjaz. I order you to cause these people to return to their families in oinal, Palestine or Trans-Jordan and to prerent the passage through Trans-Jordan of any ptrsons whose movements give cause for suspicion that their intentions are not wholly peaceful* ♦ On the 37 th the C ommondant of Police flew to AqaWand sent orders to Xbn Bafadeh that he was to come in and see him* This alarmed the party, which by tills time had Increased to some 400, and they moved off to the south• His Majesty's Representative at Jedda was aiced to convey a warning of this movement to the hedja* Government. It would appear that the movement *s engineered by the Hlsb el Kejasi whose Headquarters ere in Cairo. TwoTwo of the sycophants who* the Aair keeps attached to him put up a eohene for hie appreral that thay should hire loo oare and after filling them with armed men should attack Jauf. a. dottbt to . y hope# that the Amir might ad ranee the money for hiring the car*, this noney they would at once hare stolen and counted, If their scheme did not materialise, on at least acquiring credit with the Amir as stout hearted lad* who wore ready for anything. 8 * The hi of Minister ha* been Tory concerned as to the answer he should gire to the proposal* of * certain Ahned ahedid who, on the encouragesent of Afeb&amp;s Kilni Pasha, was ready to supply Annan with electric 1^ ight, to tar all the roads In the country f to open an agricultural Bank provided the Grant-In-Aid was deposited therein and to develop the country in a dozen other ways. The Chief Minister was perturbed becau»e these offers of help which seened to hia hardly natural were smiled upon by the Amir and his staff. In the end Ahmed ihedid was teld that he might make concrete proposals on the distinct understanding that the Government was in no way committed to anything. The only result so far h&amp;s been that a representative of Thoe. Cook and Son has visited Aaaaa and decided that his firm are not interested in the electric lighting project• With all this inefficiency to overcone it 1* not surprising that the Administrative wheels turn aLowly 9. The deserts have remained undisturbed and there hare been no raids either into or from Transjordan. The only incident to note is that a man of the Beni Sakhr has been killed by a Preach Patrol south of Usa el Jemal. 4th June, 1932. (&lt;3gd.) C.K*P. CGX.

Presumably, one must not expect any clearer retraction of the really extraordinary accusations made against Captain Glubb by the Acting High Comriseioner fcr Syria, It is only on the frontier with Palestine that raiding has given any trouble and here the Palestine Saadiyeen el Gharbiyeen have lifted a number of camels from the Beni Atia, Security on this frontier would be irrproved and the grievances of many people would be removed if the Palestine Government would enact a law to give authority in Palestine to the judgments of the Tribunals of Palestine and Trans*Jordan representatives which have met on several occasions in the past. This law has been in draft form for over two years, 2, On the 3rd of April,a Police patrol gained contact with Kuflih el Yahia and part of his band of highwaymen; one of the band was killed and another captured but J uflih himself managed to pppi Jto escape, the 24th four cars were held up on the .min road in the Jordan ralley and the people, except t' oee in a oar belonging to the Amir, were search©d and robbed. The Governoent has aonlied the Prevention of Crimee Ordinance to certain people suspected of harbouring the e rim Inals and has issued a general ■warning that everyone sueoected of this offence will be similarly treated. On the 12th instant the Chief Secretary on the way to his office in the morning was teclced in a side street by a certain Abdul Raouf as Saleh. This wan has a bad record and is a relative of and closely in touch with Tewfic Hajdawi who was at cne time a source of danger during the disturbances in Palestine in 1989, ’Hie Government suspected political motives in this attack and have placed Abdul Baouf under Police supervision at Aqaba for 8 months, 4, Dr.Abu Ohanimeh,who was Secretary of the Arab Executive (See para 10 of the Inarch report), has resigned. It is believed that his decision to do so was precipitated by his failure to arrange that the /P. 400 paid annually by the Municipality of Amman to the Government Hospital should be paid to him, 5, A good derl of excitement in Kaan and Aqaba has centred round an American Kissionary named Bren den.

The greater part of the Beni Atla tribe, being driven from the TIedJa* by lack of grasing, have come into Trans-Jordan and overflowed into Palestine. They and their flocks are in sorry state; their goats, for instance, are so debilitated that they are sold in the market at kR’an for 100 mils. Amongst the Howeitat some 200 families are destitute. Some three tons of barloy and some condemned biscuits acquired from the Royal Air Force have been pent to Rum and Mudawara for dietribution under Captain Glubb v s arrangements.

In .pita of th# fact that no E ora no more of th* oafiiolo no raids, as far as he Hedja* or Nejd by Trans-Jordan tribes. The meeting whloh took place on the 7th of January between Captain Glubb and Sheitt Abdul A.i. I bn Zeid, toough friendly, was productive of no concrete result because oi the impasse created by the raid on the A toon in ^eptoiaber 1931. opening up o:' the lara area on the Syrian frontier has made it possible for Captain Glubb and hie desert police to get into touch with the Syrian Jebel trices who at this time of the year grase in the lava belt in Trans-Jordan and have hitherto regarded themselves as unapproachable. The almost entire cessation of raiding on this frontier is the airect consequence of this. Conditions in the Southern Deserts of Traus- Jordan are bad; no rain has fallen there since last winter aad the lane is a pourdery waste with no grasing at all. &amp;ost of the Howeitat, who in a normal year would be in their grasing grounds east of the Hallway line, have been forced westward to their summer pastures in the hills. where•Vfltt wh«re the severe coi^ u - e has caused manv a- their animals.

On being aeked for hie reply to Lord Reading’s question, re: erred to in paragraph 5 of the report for December, as to the settlement of Jews in Trans-Jordan the •mir said that personally he thought it would bebenefioial if news took up land in the Jordan valley provided that their arrival would at the same time bring benefit to their Arab neighbours. He added that he oould not say there was no political difficulty, and that, before Jewish •ettlemente could bo permitted, a special law must be enacted making provision therefor, and that definite proposals should be put up so that they might be embodied in a draft law and be plaoed before the Legislative council for consideration.4 * ° ne of «r e t aote of the fi r , t , , * Couaoil was to enact i ^ ** ® latlT# a -aw proriaing for the discharge of non-Trans-Jordanian officials.

It is said that this agitation, whioh is not directed against British officers in the Oorernment, was engineered by the Amir as a means of making his Soyarnmont unpopular.

It 18 difficult to eaeure that a dsoision 8 heuld bo based on the m.rit. of each oa 8e and not bo influ.nood by political considerations. I hare mentioned this because it is the cause of much interest and i s arousing considerable ill-feeling. 6. Between 1.1.30 and 31.12.30, 42 cases of highway robbery, and between 1.1.31 and 31.12.31 66 oases of highway robbery hare been reported to the &gt;olice. The advisability of introducing the death penalty as a deterrent icr this crime has been considered and put aside fi-t the 'overnment have been advised to males a sentence of flogging compulaory in every caae. 6, The kmir has reduced the sentence of death on i two men convicted ofi^urder to ten years imprisonment and on the occasion of the feast of Bairam has granted pardon to 10 persons who were undergoing imprisonment. 7. The imir Talal, who has been at a loose end in Amman for many months following his attachment to the Cyprus Government and subsequently to the military school in Baghdad, was attached to the Middlesex Regiment for ■’uty on the 18th of February. I am sorry to a.oy that he ie already showing signs of discontent. 6. On the first day of Bairam the Amir moved dorm to his camp in the Jordan valley ?ind two days later entertainedila hospitality and for Ms arrangeEsnt to entertain him a-Jordan rather than in distant at the western edge of Trane-Jord imman and for bringing bis Government along as well. It counteract the recent visit of Abbas Hilmi laaha and the telegram in question was sent for propaganda and that propaganda purposea and auhaequent publication. 3. tb» Amir's Secretary, who was sent off with a letter to Abbas Hilmi dealing with arrangements for the lease of the Amir's land in the Jordan valley, returned to Amman on the «i4th February with an offer from the Oomsmgnie vgricole Induetriolle et Commeroiale d'Orient to the effect that they were ready to pay £P.2,0C0 for an option of one year to take up the lease of the Ghor el Kibid on the understanding that if the contract of lease were signed it would include deduction of this sum of £P.2,000 by inetalmente from the rent. I understand that the Amir ha© ta&amp;en up this offer. The Amir’s Secretary iniorm© me that Abbas Hilmi 1 asha asiced a number of searching questions about the lining law of Trans-Jordan and the possibility of obtaining mining rights. It is, I thiolc, fairly clear that mining concessions are to be the quid pro quo for the help given in leasing the Amir’s land. 10. Mr. Hutenberg, the Managing Director of the Palestine Electric Corporation, with his Secretary, visited Amman on the 11th and listh February to discuss outstanding mattersmatters inoludiag the Tamattu Tax. This rielt was followed up some days later by the Secretary who reached agreement with the Treasury In regard to the Tamattu Tax. V is agreement 1 8 . hower.r, subject to the concurrence of the Trans-Jordan Ooyernn.ent and the Secretary of state. 11. Sir Andrew Ryan, Hl s Majesty's Minister at Jeddah, was present in Amman on the l 2t h and l 3t h February, -attera of mut.-U interest were discussed and the an.aKlng difficulties in the way of getting back any camels for Trans-Jordan tribesmen were appreciated. Tow «wds the end of I^ebruary some of the Beni Atia tribe oommenoed to move into Trane-Jordan. That this might happen was envisaged in August, 1931. Their entry was actually made after punitive measures had been taken against the tribe by the Kejdian Authorities but it is believed that lack of graeing would have compelled the Beni Atia to move in any case.

The Amir haa become a somewhat frequent visitor to lalestine. He has visited Nazareth and Haifa in connection with a jaunt to a tourist ship in Haifa harbour, ari« has been to Jerusalem several times to visit his daughter who was in hospital, his son who is attached to the Regiment there and hie Father’s tomb. Whether his visits have some other purpose as well is still obaoure. 3. Besides Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr* Rendel of the foreign Office, hie brother Ali has recently advised the ijair to recognise King Ibn Saoud as King of the Redjaz. The Amir has informed hie brother that the latter of course is at liberty to renounce his right to the throne of the Hedjae if he so desires but that in that event the Amir succeeds to that right and has no intention of resigning it. he added that he would only give way to British insistence in this matter in exchange for substantial compensation.•Yv-iO *. 1 n»b.r « „ tt , Fi . &lt;iioh c C “ r0 '‘ 8 “ * f '' Ub * U “» '&gt; *— »« «b. 6« „ f were the guests of the Royal iin • «oy ai A lr ?oroe Amman. The Prenoh team won a good game against the Royal Air Roro. and throughout the rlsit a very oordlal spirit prerailed. o. General ^assist has recently been appointed Oorernor of the Jebel Drute in sucoeaeion to aeneral Clement Srondoourt who was known amongst his colleagues as le R 01 de 1 atagonie and who, being annoyed at the agree- ment reached la laris last October whereby a part of the territory of I'rans-Jordan which had been occupied by the •'reach, and thus rendered sacred, was to be returned to , raus-u oraan, tendered his resignation once too often. 6# ^apitaine Dessideri, the Tribal Officer of the ^ 0Del ruse, wae Colonel Pesuce’a guest in Amman for a ni^ht towards the end of March. I told him that I had heard that complaints had been submitted that Captain Ciaub had been acting in a manner which was detrimental to peace on the frontier and had even sent off tribesmen to raid into Syria# I mentioned a statement of a senior French officer which had been repeated to me that a rifle which had been taicen from Trans-Jordan tribesmen should be returned to Captain Glubb who had sent the men into Syria to raid. 1 said that I presumed these stories were produced by French Intelligence Agents and remarked that such stories as these were not infrequently recounted to us about ifrenoh officers. I said that the Intelligence officers were an affliction from which we all had to suffer but that we must be sensible and accept the stories produced with caution.I added that I was amassd to hear that auoh stories had been g ir en aoy credence and that w. at this particular time were oongratulating oureelres on the rery great improvement in public security which Captain aiubb's efforts near the Northern frontier had produced. ■ipitaine Deasideri assured me that he fully appreciated the good work Captain Olubb had done and said that now General Clement Orandoourt had departed a more reasonable outlook would be possible. As regards the ri iii ne reminded me that we had first asked for its return in October last. He said it had been lying in Store all the time and that he had not dared to return it so long as General Clement Grandcourt was there because whenever the latter inspected the Store he asked about ^ ■ da. ^apitaine easideri had however now brought it aloug with him. 7 * Amir who had been informed by the High Jomr.iseicner that he was unable, at present, to recommend that any change be made in the 1928 Agreement haring returned to the attack was told on the 13th that there was no chance of any change being agreed to by the present Government in England and was persuaded to accept this verbal reply for the present. 8 . Since the Beni At la first began to enter the country from the Hedjas about the 20 th February some 350 tents have entered the country. Bill! and Howeitat el Taheima were moving northwards and parallel to the Beni Atia at the same time. These people were obliged to leave the Hodjas in search for grazing and the tainor punitive expedition which was carried out against the Beni Atia by the Amir of Tebuk in the middle of February probablyprobably had no effect on their morementa one way or the other. The Beni Atla have given no trouble aince entering Trane-Jordan and it i 8 hoped that the excitement in regard to them has now subsided. The Land Department has been carrying out a fiscal survey of the country for the last three years and a Law based on the results obtained was placed before the ^egislativ# ^ounoil during the Ordinary Session which has just come to an end. The Coniuitteee of the Council to whom the law was referred have shewn themselves unwilling to ass it oeoause, being large land owners and well to do men, they are unwilling to pass a law which will cause the large land owner to pay taxes in proportion to his wealth. A further enc savour to convince them of the error of their way^i will be made when they reassemble in Extraordinary Session to consider the Estimates of 1931/32 which were approved by the Secretary of State on the last day of the Financial Year. A member of the Legislative Council who is a large land owner recently expressed the opinion in the Council that the Iraq Petroleum Company should not be alioweu to lay their pipe line through Trans-Jordan because they would employ, in laying the line, the men he wanted to engage for his harvest. There does not seem to be much hope of persuading such men to pass the land Tax Law. 10. The assembly of the Fourth Congress of the Arab Executive has been under discussion for some weeks. When it became evident that it could not prevent it the Government sought means of neutralising its effect as much as possible. The Amir was not at first averse to the assembly of the Congress and advised those who askedfor his opinion to attend, but .hen it beeame.nown that the Kieoutire Co^ittee did not intend to inrite the ■nernbere of the A.ir-s anti-Oorerzunent party the to i r gave orders that people should be advised to remain away. When the Congress assembled on the 15th of Karch some 100 people were present, of whom not more than 20 uen were people of any importance. The Jaw requires that the Goyernment should have notice of all business to be transacted and when a certain Mohammed Ss Saad, a notable from the north and a member of the legislative Council, rose early in the proceedings to m&lt;Ue a speech, which was to propose a change in the menibership of the Executive Committee but which was not on the agenda, he waa prevented from speaking and left the meeting in a huff accompanied by five other notables. A speech was then made by \dil el kzmeh who is a Syrian National 1st but practices as an advocate in Trane-Jordan and is a member of the legislative Council. He related how the Mao Mahon promises had remained unful filled, how Trans-Jordan had come into being and stated that the 1928 agreement being a bad one must be changed by peaceful pressure^ Nejib Abu Sha’ar, a Christian advocate, then followed and said that the country must be wide awake to the danger of Zionism and ready to resist its penetration into Trans-Jordan. He said that the Palestine Electric Corporation and the Palestine x otash Company were Zionist outposts. Saleh Samadi, another advocate who was educated an officer in Berlin, then described the neod for cancelling 1 1 / Ai,oanoelling the repreeeiv,, , .reeeire l awa whioh the GoTe enaoted e u 0 h as the IreTentioa of Crlm T J lBee law and the n00tlTa •P®hi 1 hi 1 itjr f 0r crime law. r.

The new road which was carried labour from iiafrak station on the Hedjas Jerash, a distance of some 26 miles, is passes through the excellent Beni Hassan out by village az Railway to now opened. It country where a settlement scheme has recently been carried out. This road and another road which leade from B * ^ t0 JiBr ed Daaieh ln the ^rdan valley, and which has also been made by village labour, has been pushed t - cu^h by the personal energy of Abdul Mahdi el Shemaili, the present Governor of the Belqa District. la. The ^ir has raised a storm in a tea cup on account of the police ordering a motor oar containing some of the Amir's servants, which had halted in such a manner as to obstruct the traffic, to move on, After ordering the men concerned to be suspended from duty and that the ofiicer in charge of the Amman iolice should be changed he was confronted with the result of the investigations which it had been necessary to hold and climbed down. as the Ajidr steadily refused to assent to the Land registry Fees Law which had been approved by the otoretary of State and passed by the Legislative Council it became necessary for the British Resident to see him on the subject and persuade him to assent. 14. The crops in the North an centre of the country have been saved from total loss by moderate rains which have fallen uring the last few days of March - the rain has not however been sufficient to make the crop a good one In the South it has been quite inadequate. 15.

INDIA OFFICE (£0720) Wt 18117/2750 10,000(2) 12/31 H &amp; SP Gp 112SECRET REPORT OH THE POLITICAL SITUATION for t ig month of .De cenber 1931 n I''* His Hi ® !iness the Attir expressed a wish that I should obtain the views of His Excellency the High Commissioner to a nr op o sal that he should attend the r^^ ious ceremony in the Mosque in Jerusalem on the eve of &lt;-ne opening 01 the Islamic Congress adding that if he went he would in all probability be elected President of the Congress. On being informed that such a proposal would almost certainly be unwelcome he agreed to withdraw it but said that he would invite the delegates to lunch with him in the Jordan valley instead. Though no members of the Government attended, the Congress, there were a number from amongst the people and these included several members of the Legislative Council who were encouraged to attend by the Amir. The luncheon party took place on the 12th when the Amir was considerably annoyed by one of the guests who, in answer to a question as to the comfort and safety of pilgrims visiting Mecca, replied that arrangements were much better than in the days of King Hussein. 2. The progress of affairs in Syria has given rise to much interest in Trans- Jordan,local opinion being strongly in favour of Ali, if there is to be a King at all. The failure of the elections is attributed to interference of French officials who, it is said, arraviged that be lore balloting commenced the ballot boxes should be filled with voting papers in favour of persons acceptable to thethe French. A telegram has been received by the Amir from his brotner Ali saying ^nat there is nov/ no objection to it oeing xnown t- at ne is a candidate to the Syrian throne. This is interpreted to mean that King Faisal and also the French Consul in Baghdad are ready to lend Ali their support. Ad bas Kilmi Pasiia, wr.ose visit had been postponed by him till the conclusion of the Islamic Congress in Jerusalem, arrived in Amman on the 25th where he remained till the 29th as the Amir 1 s guest. He visited the antiquity sites which were not too far away from Amman and admitted with cheerful frankness that they were no exception to antiquities in general which bored him to death. The Amir* s hopes that the land which he has recently acquired in the Jordan valley might be leased to his guest were not realised. On his departure Abbas Hilmi stated that he had found his visit most interesting but quite long enough, and added that he certainly did not envy anyone who occupied the post of British Rsside.vt. I am told tnat he advised the Amir not to make the error, which he himself had made in 'Egypt and sinceiegretted, of falling out with the British officials who are here to help him* 4. On the 29th the Amir together with the Amir Shaker who is President of the Bedu Control Boar:., the Chief Minister and the Amir 1 s Secretary were the guests of His Excellency the High Commissioner in Jerusalem. . ey s^e. t the night at Government House and left lor Amman afuer lunch on the following day. They were much pleased with their;is an added compliment their reception and the Amir took it to limself that Abbas Hilmi Pasha was also a guest of His Excellency. 5 * 0n the raorning of the 3Cth Lord Reading who is Chairman of t ne Palestine Rleotric Corporation, asked the Anir ii t ere would he any objection to Jews settling in Trans-Jordan to share, with the Arabs in the advantages which would follow any irrigation development scheme which was financed by the Palestine Electric Corporation. He be raised from Jewish sources and would explained that the capital necessary would^not be available unless Jews would obtain some benefit therefrom and that he asked the question so that he should not waste his time in working on a scheme which could not prove a success. The Amir replied that this was a question to which he could not give an immediate answer, for himself he felt that cooperation between Arabs and Jews led to better feeling but that he must ascertain the wishes of the ITandatory Power and of his Government and feel the pulse of his people. 6. Permission has been given for the Italian Hospital in Amman to open a branch hospital in Kerak. 7. The C.M.S.Hospital at Es-Salt has been in receipt of an annual subsidy from the Government of £P. 240 in return for which it treats Government patients on special terms. An attempt has been made to cause t ie immediate v/ithdrawal of this subsidy out has, happil j, been defeated. (Sgd) C.H.P. Cox. British Resident.5 B B f 0 R T OK THE £- 2 .k.;. 2 -LSJLk SITUATION jos^hsi month of November. 1931. On my return from leave on the 2nd November I was met outside the town, as usual, by the Chief Minister and the members of the Executive Council. Usual practice was, however, departed from in that the Amir Shaker was amongst those who had come out to welcome me; I am given to understand that this was arranged as a sign that the Amir’s desire for the severance of my connection with the Trans-Jordan is not generally supported. 2. On the 5th of November the Amir gave a dinner party in my honour at the conclusion of which usual practice was again departed from in that he made a speech welcoming me back to Trans-Jordan. The speech was very friendly but contained a hint that I should refrain from interference in the affairs of the Government • 3* Two or eminent men, a Moslem and a Christian during a call on me shortly after my return expressed the opinion that the Amir was impeding rather than helping the proper government of the country and that it were better that he should be replaced by his son Talal. It is probable that the suggestion was made merely to observe my reaction thereto. 4. The Editor of the Sowt Esh Sha’ab has promised a member of the Palestine Government that the attacks made in that paper against Captain Glubb and the Desert Patrol should cease. My suspicion that the Amir, if he did not instigate, could easily have stopped these attacks is strengthened by the fact that the Editor has given the name of the person ^ o the articles and this person is a member of the Amir’s perty and one who is closely in touch with him.5. On the 12th I drew the Amir’s attention to an article which had appeared in a Palestine newspaper in which it wss &amp; stated that .assan ;dialed lasha had assurances from the Colonial Office that would lead to his re-instatement in Trans-Jorden shortly after the arrival of the new High Commissioner in the country. I informed the Amir that this story and a number of others of like nature which had been spread abroad were entirely without foundation. It would appear that the Amir has spoken of the matter to Hassan Khalid, for I received a letter from the latter a few days aa*o enclosing a copy of a newspaper in which he had inserted an article denying the truth of the story in question. 6. After trying variousa»ans to disunite and enfeeble his present ISxecutive Council, the Amir has partially succeeded by bringing under his influence the Christian member thereof. This person has arrived at his present position largely owing to my insistence that his claims and capabilities should be recognised, warning which I have now given him will, I believe, and the /cause to him to act more sensibly. 7. An order issued by the Amir for the pardon of a man convicted of a serious forest offence has been successfully resisted. 8. It appears strange that the Amir should not be content to work with his Government for the better government of his country and to leave the conduct of affairs to them so long as they work loyally and well. His point of view, however, is that the Mandatory Power should believe that it is he alone who can make the wheels run smoothly and that whenever anything is to ce done or whenever any mistake is to be rectified we should run c him for help. To this end he is not satisfied that his Government should govern well; on the contrary he likes * party, whether in the Executive Council or in the Legislative Council, which under his orders will make difficulties and under His orders will clear them out of the way again. He fears that, should he assume his proper position of a figure head, we should then come to the conclusion that he is needless should13 . I shoulclbe better without him. i S. Sir Francis Humphry, .p^t the night of the 12th in Amman on hi. way hac* to Ira,. r „ ult of hi8 n8gotlaWonE with li* Fon.ot in Paris in regard to the Horthern Frontier was explainac to the Amir who expressed himself a. well satisfied and cordially thanhad Sir Francis for the service he had rendered. 10. On the 23rd. Hie Sxc.llenoy the High Coomi.sioner mad. hi. official entry into Trans-Jordan. That he should have visited Trans-Jordan so soon after his arriSl^* mch appreciated* 11. Arrangements for the attachment of the Amir Talal to the staff of the Air Officer Commanding, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, are nearing completion. This is most satisfactory as it will give the boy a genuine interest in life and will remove him from the influence of the Palace which cannot be good for him. IE. On the 30th* the French Consul-General in Jerusalem called on the Amir. he told me that the French plan, after the elections hare been carried out in January next, is if possible to conclude treaties with Syria and the Lebanon and to arrange that they should become members of the League of Kations. After that it would be a matter of indifference to the French whether Syria had a King or not, and who that King might be. He told me that Abbas Hilmi was amongst the candidates for the throne. The following day I asked the Amir how far he thought the French were likely to go in wairing their control orer Syria. He said that they could not be expected to go any further than His Majesty's Gcnrsrnment had gons in their treaty with Iraq some years ago. He told me that the Hashimites, at any rate, would resist the choice of Abbas Hilmi as King. Local opinion, howerer, is that the Amir would rather see Abbas Hilmi King of Syria than his brother Faisal, and that the Amir would not resist the appointment of Abbas Hilmi provided the latter could convince him that, by his influence and money, Abdullah should be made T 'ing of the Hedja*.12 b Communications on this subjeci should he addressed to— Tqe Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted •— 7^ Reference to previous correspondence: Letter thz Colonial Office of the t Transmitted dire ction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. A copy has also been sent to the Colonial Office, Downing Street, ^ L 193 /.S T . r O O Active endeavours were made by the Opposition to convene on the 15th October a Congress at Amman in order to demand a change of the membership of the Executive council, the dissolution of the Legislative Council, the amendment of the Trans-Jordan Agreement and the remission of all arrears of taxation. it is probable that the Opposition received some encouragement from the Amir in organising this movement but they failed completely to find any support elsewhere and no Congress materialised. 2. The Amir sent one of the Palace staff to h Ali Riza Pasha Rikabi to come to Trans-Jordan with a view to assuming office as Chief Minister eventually. Kikabi refused the invitation. 3. Rumours were current of a concentration of wejd forces at Jauf and it was suggested in certain quarters that a free issue of ammunition to the Trans-Jordan tribes would not be inappropriate in the circumstances. The jli rumours proved to be without foundation. 4. The inhabitants of the Belqa district indulged in what appeared to be an orgaiised agitation for remission of taxation pointing out, in support of their request, that remissions had been recommended in the case of most other districts. The Government’s reply was simply to the effect that the remissions proposed elsewhere were in respect of fixed taxes whereas the tithe payable in the Belqa was assessed annually on the basis of the produce ootained hy the farmers and it followed, therefore, that a bad year in'&lt;no in the Belqa brought about an automatic reduction of taxation in that district. 5. On the 28th October, an unconfirmed report was received on the effect that Knud fbbnboe, a Danish journalist and a convert to Islam, had been killed in the Hedjaz, douth of Aqaba. No confirmation or otherwise of this report has yet been obtained. a number of virulent attacks were made on the Desert Patrol by means of Articles in the Palestine newspaper, the 'Sowt-esh-bha 1 ab' and the Amir issued a communique from the Palace denying the allegations made in these articles and expressing his satisfaction with the work of the Patro1. 7 • The Ex-King Ali of the Hedjaz arrived from I Baghdad by air on the 30th October. There is reason to believe that he was pressed by the Amir to come to Trans-Jordan in order that they might cooperate in opposing Faisal’s pretentions tothe Syrian throne. The possibility of a union between Syria and the Iraq excited little interest outside the Nationalistic circles at Amman. (Sgd.) A.S.

Apart from a number of no importance, the Amir was at peace with his Council. 2. King Faisal's visit on the 27th of September and his statements regarding his candidature for the throne of Syria removed all interest in Trans-Jordan affairs from the Amir's mind for the moment and His Highness can think and talk of nothing but what he is pleased to term Faisal’s 'treachery'. X 3. His Highness was inclined to be obstractive the expropriation of land for the use of the Royal Air Force at Amman but was eventually amenable to reason. 4 * On 3th September the Consul-General of Italy, accompanied by two engineers, visited Amman andKerak. He upseo one Amir oy referring to a project, of which neither His Highness or the Government had any knowledge, to open an Italian Hospital at Kerak. In fact, the engineers went to the length of examining a disused Government building at Kerak with a view to converting it into a Hospital. ove, The Italians are not at present popular in the Arab world and if the projected construction of a hospital is proceeded with I anticipate a great deal of obstruction. The presence of the hospital at Kerak would be an undoubted benefit to the country but for political reasons it is preferable that the matter should be shelved for the time being.5.

He was dissatisfied with his position as i,i r 0 f a s.all State like Trans-Jordan, the amount of his Cim Llat and the restriotlons imposed upon hie po^erof interfering personally in matters of detail by the existence of a united and relatively efficient Government. The Amir first attempted to ohange the holder of the post of Chief Secretary to the Trans-Jordan Government hoping thereby ultimately to bring about other changes in the membership of the Bxeoutive Council. Ahen I made it clear to the Amir that no change in the membership of the Executive Council would be agreed to at present, he changed his tactics and endeavoured to cause the Chief Minister to resign by inflicting upon him a series of public slights. The Chief Minister was, at the time, rauoh upset and there was some danger of the Amir succeeding. I induced the Chief Alinister, however, to demand an explanation from the Amir without referring to the possibility of resignation and, characteristically, the Amir executed a ,1 volte face* and issued a letter of confidence in the present Executive Council. This letter, of which i enclose a copy, was printed and issued by the Government in the form of a public circular; it was also published in the Arabic Press of Palestine and Syria. 2* The 'shadow cabinet’* of the Opposition, who were entertained by the Amir to lunch on the day of the issue of the letter of confidence, are for the moment at a loss.
