A REPORT ON THE TRIBES OF PARS BY CAPTAIN A. J. CHRISTIAN, GENERAL STAFF, SHIRAZ. Catalogue No. C. F.-30 . Case No. 3797. Shiraz, 1918. SIMLA: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRESS. 1919 .THE TRIBES OF EARS. Introduction. The materials for the following repot have been collected from variou 'Sources and the report as it now stands is the result of the collation of all avail able details. As is inevitable in a report of this nature there are many defects and shortcomings. With a view to facilitating the correcting and supplementing of the report, blank sheets have been interleaved and it is requested that wher ever and whenever possible officers should correct and add to this report. Much may be done by any officer who may at any time find himself among the tribes reported upon. The Kalantars of the smaller tribes are constantly changing and such changes should be noted and reported upon whenever possible. The subjects dealt with in the appendices are only touched upon and the report cannot bo amplified in this respect except by personal reconnaissance. For the report on the Khamseh tribes much valuable assistance was ren dered by Captain 0. A. Butters, S. P. R., during his tour in 1917 with His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk. The report on the Qashgais has been based upon the Military Report on Fars, by Captain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., D.S.O., Indian Political Department and this report has beer, added to and corrected in the fight of more up-to-date information. The following summary shows the total number of families comprising the nomad tribes of Fars :— Qashgai .. .. .. Khamseh .. .. .. .. ,. Boir Ahmadi .. .. .. .. .. Mamassani .. .. .. .. Dushmanziari Lashani Mishmast Sundry smaller tribes (see list on page 69.) Total nom d families 33,045 17,330 6,100 2,700 2,000 1,500 300 12,030 75,005 Note .—The above figures, and all estimates of streng hs given in this report, are dated before the influenza epidemic of October-November 1918. Tribal losses have been very heavy. His Excellency the Qawam himself stated in conversation (in December 1918) that he had heard that the Baharlus had lost nearlv 60 per cent, of their total strength. This figure, if correct, is however exceptional. No estimate of losses is yet available but it will be no exaggeration to say that the nomad tribes of Ears have lost 20 per cent of their total strength during the epidemic.' \ (ii ) The following symbols have been used to indicate the pronunciation of place and tribal names :— a .. long “ a ” as in bath, a ..

A. — General. The Khamseh '(Arabic—five) Tribes are :— (i) The Arabs. (n) The ’Ainahi. (Hi) The Baharlu. (iv) The Baseri. (v) The Nafar. The Nafar tribe originally numbered some 1,000 families but these are now to a large extent dispersed and settled in Bakhtiari country. Part of the tribe remains however, and they are still considered as a unit of the Khamseh tribes. Of these tribes the Arabs and Baseri alone are migratory. The ’ Ainalu, Baharlu and Nafar are of Turkish origin as also are the Baseri, with the exception of one “ tireh,” or sub-tribe, the Turbur Chaharbuncheh, whose language is Persian. The Arabs, as their name implies, are of Arabic origin and came originally from Najd and Oman. Full details of the origin of these tribes are given under the sub-headings. Organisation. The present titular head and chief of the Khamseh tribes is Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk, son of Habibullah Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk, who died in spring 1916 as a result of a fall from his horse. The appointment of the chief of the Khamseh tribes is now hereditary (subject to the approval of the Persian Government) and has descended directly from father to son since the time of Haji Mirza Ah Akbar Khan, who died in 1865.

The. present Qawam during his first year of office had little real authority over his tribes. During the winter of 1917-18, however, he undertook a tour amongst the tribes, and the firm attitude adopted by him has done much to enhance his prestige and personal authority. He was accompanied on his tour by a British officer with a company of South Persia Kifles infantry and a troop of cavalry, and there is little doubt that this open support by the British is largely responsible for the success of the tour. Each sub-tribe has its Kalantar appointed by the Qawam and nominally responsible to him for the maintenance of order and the collection and payment of taxes. The Kalantar ship of each “ taifeh ” is nominally hereditary. The Katkhodas of the smaller tribes (or “ tirehs ”) are appointed by the Kalantars of the larger tribes, with the approval of the Qawam.3 Immediately under the Qawam is the “ Pishkar-eh-Arab,” appointed by the Qawam himself and in authority over all the Arab tribes. The present Pishkar-eh-Arab is Mirza Nasir, Salar Jang, who succeeded Mirza Ha i A^ha in December 1917. This change of regime was at first not popular. Mirza Nasir is a comparatively young man and said to be a man ot much less authority than his predecessor. He, however, appears to be gaming some influence and is more popular now, after some four months m oihee. Ilevenue. In 1910-11 when the late Nasr-ed-Dowleh was chief of the Khamseh tribes ho exacted 100,000 tomans revenue from the tribes. During the regime of the present Qawam, and of his father, the total yearly revenue has varied from 30,000—60,000 tomans. During the year ending 20th March H. 8, 85,000 tomans were collected. The revenue is collected by the Katkhodas of the sub-tribes, handed bv them to the Kalantars of the main tribes who in turn hand it on to the Pishkar-eh-Arab, through whom it reaches, the Qawam. This collection occuis twice yearly, in spring and autumn. 'Nu'n. hr.rs. It is impossible to obtain any accurate estimate of the strength of the tribes. The numbers given vary considerably but the following may be tauen as approximately correct at the present time (April 1918). It must be understood, however, that these figures are only approximate. Tribe. Families. Tufangchis (armed footmen). Sowars. Total fighting men. Arabs 10,130 • • . . 8,150 ’Ainalu .. 1,200 700 100 800- Baharlu .. • • »• 1,200 1,000 500 1,500 Baseri . • • • 4,500 •• 3,500 Nafar .. 300 200 Total 17,330 •• 14,150 Although the total number of armed fighting men is y as shown, probably about 14,150, the maximum force the Arabs could maintain in the field at one time would probably be no more than 3,000—4,000 men.4 In 1911 when the Khamseh were united against Nizam-es-Sultaneh and the Soulat-ed-Dowleh in the fighting in Shiraz city the Arab forces numbered some 3,000 men. Fighting Qualities. That the Arabs can and will fight has recently been proved. In January 1918 a squadron of Burma Mounted Infantry with two British officers attacked a group of Arab encampments, of the Meshedi ■ Jani Khan Arabs, and a stub born fight of four hours’ duration ensued. The Officer Commanding the British Mountain Infantry has expressed admiration of the way the Arabs fought. In the fighting in Shiraz in 1911, against the Qashgais, the Arabs showed great spirit and determination and inflicted a severe defeat on their enemies. It has yet to be seen what these tribes will do against artillery. It is improbable that they would stand against a well-directed fire. Characteristics. With perhaps the exceptions of the ’Ainalu and Baseri the main character istic of the Khamseh tribesmen is a propensity for robbery. Several small sub sections of tribes make their living by agriculture or caravan work. With these exceptions every Arab is at heart a robber and loses no opportunity of indulging this propensity. So marked is their ten dency in this direction that their own chiefs are unable in many cases to restrain them. No tribe in Persia bears the same unsavoury reputation for petty robbery as the Khamseh Arabs. Arms and Ammunition. {a) Small Arms. —The Khamseh tribes are well armed, though they possess a greater variety of rifles than the Qashgais. Most patterns of rifle may be found amongst these tribes but they are chiefly armed with Mausers, Lebels and Martinis. It is difficult to arrive at any estimate of the quantity of ammunition in the possession of the tribes. At the present time (April 1918) it is reported to be scarce among the Arabs. From recent reports it would appear that 100 rounds per rifle is a safe maximum estimate. The Kalanturs of each tribe have a small reserve, probably not more than a few hundred rounds. '' The Officer Commanding a squadron of Burma Mounted Infantry which attacked a group of Arab encampments in January 1918 estimates the maxi mum expenditure per Arab rifle in four hours’ fighting at 40 rounds and is of the opinion that the enemy ran out of ammunition. • In March 1916 the Qawam-ul-Mulk was presented by the British Govern ment with 2,000 non-charger Lee-Enfield rifles and 333,000 rounds of ammuni tion*5 r x£) No distribution return of these arms and ammunition bas been received and it is not known amongst what tribes they were divided. (b) Artillery and Machine Guns—The Qawam-ul-Mulk has two German machine guns but both are out of order and he has very little ammunition for them. His artillery consists of one 9 c.m. Turkish mountain gun for which he has practically no shell. / Habitats and Migrations. Particulars of the habitats and migrations of the tribes are given under the sub-heading of each tribe. B. Detailed History, etc., of the five Tribes. 1. The Arabs. - - ■ . - (a) History .Arabs came originally from Najd, Oman and Yemen in the VII century and, with a few exceptions, retain their nomad habits. These exceptions are the Bani turuf, Bam Lam, etc., who have become sedent ary and live near Ram Hormuz and on the banks of the Jarrahi River. These tribes are known as Tavayef (pi. of Taifeh—“ a tribe ”) and their language is still pure Arabic. They are not of the Khamseh tribes. Those who came to Pars and are now known as the Khamseh Arabs are of nomadic habits, their summer quarters being near Bavanat, Qunquri, Sarchahan, etc , and their winter quarters in the Bulak-eh-Sabeh, i.e. Fasa, Darab, Furg, Jahrum, Jiyum and as far South-East as Tang-i-Dalan. The Arabs are divided into two main branches, (a) the Jabbareh and (6) the Shaibani, the former .having originally 28 sub-tribes and the latter 23. The Jabbareh Arabs are also known as the Arab Kuchi. From ancient times until 1881 the chiefs of the Arabs were of the Shai bani branch and frequently the Baser! tribe was also under their jurisdiction., At the beginning of the XVIII century the chief was Mir Ismail Khan, Shaibani. He was succeeded by his son, Mir Mehdi Khan, who served Nadir Shah, and was also chief of the Baseris. Under Karim Khan Zand, Mir Salim Khan, son of Mir Mehdi Khan, succeeded his father as chief of the Arabs, while his brother, Mir Shafi Khan, became ch : ef of the Baseris. Salim was succeeded by his son, Agha Khan, who died in 1815 and left two sons, one ‘Abbas Khan, who was chief of the Arabs until 1837, when he died; the other.Reza Quli Khan, who was Sartip of the Baharlu and Arab infantry regiment until it was disbanded in 1863. He became chief of the Arabs in 1868 and died in 1881, at which time the chieftainship of the Arabs was given to Mirza Aili Mohd. Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk, of Shiraz. From 1837—1868 Ali Quli Khan, son of Abbas Khan, w r as chief; he vras killed in 186fc&gt;, near Daiab, by some of his own people whom he was pursuing in order to recover some horses which they had stolen from Da:ab Khan Qashgar Ho left no issue.6 In 1907 the charge of the tribe was taken away from the Qawam-ul-Mulk by Muayid-ed-Dowleh and made over to Mu’tamid-ed-Divan, on which the tribes unanimously protested and Amir Agha Khan (Mansur-es-Saltaneh) was appointed. In 1908 Mu’tamid-ed-Divan was re-appointed by H. H. Zdl-es-Sultan and immediately murdered, after which Kasr-ed-Dowleh (Habibullah Khan) was re-appointed with Mansur-es-Saltaneh as his lieutenant. Habibullah Khan was the father of the present Qawam and died as the result of a fall from his horse near Shiraz in 1916, (b) Strength .—No accurate estimate can be given, but the following figures are approximately correct: Families. Jabbareh Shaibani 6,630 4,500 Total 10,130 The'r fight ing men may be taken at Jabb5reh Sbaibani .. • • • • 4,900 3,250 Total .. .. 8,150 (r) Arms avd Ammunition .— Deports from the British officer in om- mand of the S. P. R. detachment which accompanied His Excellency the Qawam on his winter tour, 1917-1918, indicate that the Arabs tribes are armed with a great variety of rifles which even include a number of shot guns. Ammunition is reported to be scarce, bandoliers in most cases being only half full. One hundred rounds per r:fD may be taken as a safe maximum esti mate, with a small reserve of not more than a few hundred rounds in the hands of the Kalantars. ((?) Habitat.— The summer and winter quarters of the Arab tribes are shown in the tables given on page 9 and 10 and in the accompanying sketch map. The routes of migration are liable to change and are decided each year by the Qawam-ul-Mulk in consultation with the Pishkar-eh-Arab. ( e ) Language .—The language of these tribes was originally pure Arabic but is now much corrupted and is a mixture of Arabic , Persian, Turkish, and Luri. The one exception is the Chahar Buncheh Borbor, (Buzsurkhi, Jelodari and Lur), who speak Persian. ....Numerous cliangss have, however, taken place in the course of time. Many tribes, at one time influential and independent, have decreased in num bers and the remnants have attached themselves to larger tribes. The following tables compiled from information obtained by Major Y. P. B. Williams, 4th Cavalry, and Captain 0. A. Butters, S.P.R., after several months of intimate association with the Arabs, may now be taken as approximately correct. It must be understood, however, that it is practically impossible to compile any accurate table of these tribes, their strengths being particularly difficult to arrive at. It will be noticed that the numbers of fighting men given average consi derably less than one per family.. This is on account of the shortage of rifles and ammunition.11 The Mazidi “ taifeh ” of the Jabbareh section is sub-divided as follows : - Mazidi Arabs. Sub-Tribe. Kalantar. Azizli. Kohandil Khan. Qaleh Khushi. Ghalandar. Miraki. Do. Shirazi. Vali Mohammad. Khosrowi. Haji Baba. Atanieh. Mohmmad Ali Khan. Nazari. Ayaz Khan. Haq Nazari. Mohammad Mirza. Musa Shirwani. v Ash urli. C Jakan Ulchi. ) Now apparently absorbed or dispersed. The Mazidi number some 1,000—1,200 families and can raise about 200 sowars and 500 —000 tufangchis. This tribe is continually on the move during the winter, their usual winter quarters being between Binaru and Tang-i-Dalan. During the winter of 1917-1918 they were responsible for a number of robberies on the Bandar Abbas-Saidabad road. At the time of writing (April 1918) the son of Mir Bahadur Khan, their chief, is with the Qawam as a hostage, while Bahadur . Khan himself is endeavouring to collect as much of the stolen property as possible. A popular belief in connection with the Mazidi tribe is that the word “ Mazidi” is a corruption of “ziadi,” meaning “surplus,” and that they are so called because they are an addition to the original Arab tribes. Mazidis seldom intermarry with other tribes. 2. The ’Ainalu. (a) His lory .—This tribe came originally from Turkestan and settled in Fars in the XIII century. When Sliah Abbas 1 formed the Shahsevan tribe a part of the ’Ainalu joined this new tribe and settled in Northen Persia (winter between Qam and Teheran, summer in Khamsah) and Asaf-ed-Dowfeh (Ghojam Hussain Khan), chief of the Shahsevan tribe was of the Kukoar branch of thte ’Ainalu. c12 From about 1620 to 1820 the Kalantaiv of the ’Ainalu were of the Abul- yardi branch. The last of these chiefs was Mir Khan (or Mir Ah Khan) Abul- vardi (son of Abdur Rahim Khan), who became chief on his father s death m 1815 and was superseded in 1820 by Rahim Khan of the Q art branch. Several of the Abulkardi chiefs have been, at various times, officers in the Persian artillery. After Rahim Khan Qurt’a death his son Ma’snn Khan became Kalantar and was succeeded by Kalb AH Beg of the Snruldu branch, who was chiei for only a short time, being succeeded by Abbas Quli Khan, a grandson of Rahim Khan Qurt. In 1876 Bagher Khan, of the Bulaghi branch, became Kalantar. At the present time (April 1918) the ’Ainalu have two Kalantars Kohzad Khan, son of Bagher Khan Bulaghi, and Najaf Quli Khan, son of Abbas Quli Khan. (b) Strength.—The strength of this tribe is variously stated as from 800 to 2,000 families; 1,200 families is probably an approximately correct estimate. Their fighting men may be taken at about 700 tufangchis and 100 sowars, armed with a variety of rifles. (c) Arms and Ammunition.—Biftes of every description and no details available as to the numbers of each rifle in the possession of the tribe. The ’Ainalu have probably less ammunition than the other Khamseh tribes as they are not addicted to robbery, and therefore do not purchase ammuni tion to the same extent. As a maximum, say 100 rounds per rifle, with a small reserve in the hands of the various Kalantars. (d) Habitat .—This tribe was at one time migratory, with its “ Yadaq,” or summer quarters, round Romgerd and Marvdasht. They have now, however, become sedentary and live South-West of a line from Sarvesi an, Fasa, Mahdevan the majority being South-East of Rasa. A small section (the Dindarlu) lives in the Dudeh valley (Dudeh is about 30 miles East of Shiraz on the mam Shiraz- Saidabad road). (e) Language. —Turki. (/) Characteristics .—This tribe has settled down to a peaceful agricul tural life. The Dudeh valley [see {d) above] is the principal market garden for Shiraz. (p) Sub-Tribes (or “ Tirehs ”).—The following are the sub-tribes of the Ainalu with their Kalantars, according to particulars obtained by Captain13 0. A. Butters, S.P.R., during tlie spring of 1918.

History.-—Oi Turkish origin, and came to Persia from Turkestan during the time of the Saljuq and Moghul kings and settled in Ears, in the XII and XIII centuries. ( A tribe calling itself Bakarlu still exists in Turkestan.) The Baharlu were originally migratory and had their summer quarters in the districts of Ramjird and Marvdasht and their winter quarters near Sarvestan and Darab. They have now for many years been sedentary and live on the banks of the Darab River. In the time of Nadir Shah the chieftainship of the tribe was in the hands of Hap Hussain Khan of the Nafar tribe. He was succeeded at his death by his son, Mohammad Taghi Khan. The latter’s son Ali Akbar succeeded his father, but was deposed in 1852 in favour of Mullah Ahmad14 of the Ahmadlu branch of Baharlus. Mullah Ahmad then became known as Ahmad Khan, and on his death in 1858 the chiefs of various branches fought for supremacy until 1862 when Grovernment troops interfered and Mirza Charagh Ali Beg, son of Shah Beza Beg of the Talakeh branch, was appointed chief. He was killed in 1876 by the sons of Nasrullah Khan, of the Ahmadlu tribe, and the authorities appointed Hussain Khan, Baha- dur-i-Nizam of the Ismail Khani section, a relative of the late Mullah Ahmad. The two principal Baharlu Kalantars at the present time are :— 1. Abdul Hussain Khan ; outlawed by the Qawam-ul-Mulk, and now in the camp of the Soulat-ed-Dowleh. 2. Amir Agha Khan ; imprisoned by the Qawam-ul-Mulk. *Abdul Hussain Khan, Bahar- In April 1917 the Qawam-ul-Mulk led a puni- lu, made his peace with the tive expedition against the Baharlus and inflict- (b) . Strength — The Baharlu are said to number about 1,200 families and to be able to raise 1,000 sowars and 500 tufangchis under favourable conditions. This tribe is rich in horses and appear to have a rooted ob jection to undertaking any journey or military operations on foot. (c) Anns and* Ammunition. A miscellany of rifles, and ammuni tion at probably about 50—100 rounds per rifle. The Baharlus are report ed to have fairly large reserves of ammunition. (d) Habitat. This tribe is now sedentary, living summer and winter round Darab and K1 usu. (c) Language. —Turki. and the teiror of the ‘‘Garmsir.” In spirng 1917, however, the Qawam m icted se^er punishment upon them and this has had a salutory effect. ($) Sub-Tribes.

(a) History .—From the 'time of the Safa vis until the reign of Karim Khan Zand, the Baseri were directly under the head of the Arab tubes. Mir Mehdi Khan, chief of the Arabs, on his death entrusted the governor ship of the Arabs to his elder son Mir Salim Khan and that of the Baseris to his younger son Mir Shah Khan. After the death of Mir Shafi Khan, his son Mirza Bafi Khan succeeded him and he in turn was succeeded by Moham mad Taghi Khan. After his death in 1862 the tribe was placed directly under the Qawam-ul-Mulk. At the present time ( April 1918) the Kalantar is Parviz Khan, son of Haji Mohammad Khan. He has the reputation of being a wise and just ruler.17 (5). Strength. — Estimates of the strength of this tribe vary considerably, the figures ranging between 3,000 and 6,000 families 4,000—5,000 families is probably correct. Their fighting strength is estimated at 3,500 men. (c) Arms and Ammunition. —As for other tribes—a maximum of 100 rounds per rifle with small reserve. (d) Habitat. — See “ Sub-Tribes.” (e) Language.-- A corrupt form of Arabic, not Turkish as generally believed. The tribesmen themselves believe they are the descendants of Basra Arabs. (/) Characteristics.— The Baseri are not addicted to robbery, though in the summer of 1917 they came into contact with the Burma' Mounted Infantry on one occasion. They own large numbers of transport animals which they ply for hire. This is their chief source of livelihood and it is in all probablity on account of this that they do not migrate far. With the exception of the Vaisi section their summer and winter quarters are all within a radius of aboout 50 miles of Shiraz city, and close to the main caravan routes. (g) Sub-Tribes. — The Baseri are divided into two sections—• A. The Vaisi, B. The Allah Mirzai, which are again sub-divided as shown in the attached table:— C.3J5GSB19 5. The Nafar. (a) History. —This tribe is of Turkish origin. During the reigns of Nadir Shah and Karim Khan Zand the chief of the Nafar tribe (and of the Baharlu) was Haji Hussain Khan, Nafar. He was succeeded by his son Mohammad Taghi Khan, who was in turn succeeded by his son Ali Akbar Khan. The latter, in 1837, was appointed Master of Cere monies to Faraidun Mirza, Governor of Fars, and died in 1853, shortly after having been deposed from the chieftainship of the Baharlu by Mullah Ahmad. He was succeeded as chief of the Nafar tribe by his son Mohammad Hassan Khan, who, some years later, took to writing poetry and retired into private life, when the tribe was given to the Beglarbegi of Fars (i.e., the Qawam-ul- Mulk). (b) Strength. —This tribe is now very weak, numbering not more than 2—300 tents with perhaps 100—-150 tufangchis. The chief Kalantars are Yadullah Khan and Iliius Khan, both of whom were imprisoned by the Qawam in March 1918 for robbery. The Nafar tribe has now sunk into insignificance. (c) Habitat. —Sedentary ; living in the Gerash district. The Mo jdla'jdt. (from the Arabic “ Moqata’a, ” a contract). The name given to a collection of Arab tribes, who, having no Kalantars of their own (either collectively or severally) were “ contracted ” to one Haji Jaffar Beg by Mirza Ali Mohammad Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk (1820—1853). The Moqata’jat originally numbered some 10—15 tribes, large and small, living in various parts of the Khamseh country. After the death of Haji Jaffar Beg, however, they rapidly declined and ther^ are now but few families of this congerie k-ft. There are a few scattered families in the Buluk of Sarvestan. These are now known as “ Zoghdli,” their means of livelihood bei^g principally the burn ing and transport of Zoghdl (charcoal). There is another small isolated group of families in and around Qasr Dasht and another living in Saadi (Shiraz) engaged in cultivation. These were ori ginally “ raiyat badi ” or peasants who may move at any time to another dist rict. They have, however, been settled so long in Saadi now that they may be regarded as “ raiyat khaki ” or settled peasants. In some of the larger Khamseh tribes a few families of Moqata’jat may still be found and many families migrated to Bakhtiari country and to Khorasan. The Qarai, Ardbiz, Tatti and Tarbor (see table on page 9) are also said to have belonged to the Moqata’jat.20 The Qashgdi tribes. Note. Paragraphs in inverted commas have been token from the Military Report on Fan, 1916, by Captain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O. (a) Origin. —The Qashgais spring from the Turkoman tribe of Khalaj which settled in Asia Minor during the middle ages. At the end of the XIV century when Timur moved the Khalaj to central and eastern Persia a band of them fled and settled in Pars. These were called' £ Qachqai ” or “ those who fled’’(from Qachmak—to flee). “ Changes in pronunciation afterwards converted this appellation into ' Qashgai.” Another tradition has it that Hulaghu Khan brought them from Kashgar. The language of the Qashgai has remained Turki to this day and the in habitants of Pars usually speak of them as “ Turk.” In course of time the original band became divided into two parts, because a large section retained the nomadic habit of migration, spring and autumn. I The one part kept the Turkoman appellation of “ Kalach,” and the other was called Qashgai, each having several branches, all known now-a-days as Qashgai. Of all the “ tirehs ” or clans of to-day the Shishbuluki and Farsimadan are of the very few stated to be “ Khalach ” in origin. ” (?&gt;) Habitat. —The Qashgai move further in their annual migrations than any other tribe in Persia. Their Qishlaq extends as far south as Riz, Jam and Gelahdar and their Yailaq as far north as the country west of Qumisheh. Their western boundary reaches to within a few miles of Behbehan and their eastern limit is the Qir-o-Karzin plain. They will not be found in the Kara Aghach valley from Kavar to Taduan (Tadun, D.S. 17-H .B., I). “ The province of Pars is administratively divided into a number of Gov ernorships (Hukumats). Sub-Governorships (Naib-ul-Hukumeh) and Districts (Fuluk) of which the last named are very ill-defined. A large number of these l u uk, and a few Governorships are in the possession of the Qashgai tribe and whatever settled population there may be in the towns or villages of those districts is under the control, and entirely at the mercy of, the Qashgai “ II ” and its chiefs. During the past few years, under Soulat-ed- Dowleh particularly, 1 here has been a considerable extension of power of the Ilkhani and the tribes in this direction. A very large portion of Pars is therefore in the hands of, or connected with, the Qashgais, and the settled population of those districts and the men left in charge of land under cultivation by the tribe form a_ large addition to the numbers of the actual tribesmen. In many cases the settled villagers detest the tribesmen for plunder of the villlage flocks, oppression, destruction of their crops and highway robbery—the cry “ galeh burdeh and ” (they have carried off the flocks) is frequently Imard from shepherds hastening back to their villages—but the “ Turks ” have the whip hand over all.” ( ’)• Strength .—Prom recent reliable information it would appear that the Qashgai “ II ” does not number more than 35,000 families.( 2 % 21 The Qa^ 1 gais themselves reckon an average of 5 souls per family, giving: a total of 175,000 souls for the whole tribe. The above figures include the “ Ilyats ” alone. To this must be added the number of villagers who come under the jurisdiction of the Ilkhani. These probably number some 20—25,000 families. The Ilkhani therefore exercises control over :—• Families. Ilyats .. .. .. .. .. .. 35,000 Villagers in Sarhada and Garmsir who come under the influence of Ilkhani .. .. .. .. .. .. 20—25,000 Total .. 55—60,000 (d) . Fighting Strength. —For every family at least one fighting man may be reckoned, giving a theoretical total of 30,000 fighting men. Captain A. T. ilson estimates 3 fighting men to every 2 families. This figure represents the maximum number of rifles available in the tribe. No Ilkhani, however, has ever been able to maintain a force of more than 4—5,000 men in the field at any one time. In 1911, when the Qashgais were united against the Khamseh tribes, and again during the fighting around Shiraz in May and June 1918, the Ilkhani had not more than 4—5,000 Qashgais- under his command, in spite (f favourable circumstances. In the latter instance the whole “ II ” was mobilized for migration to the Sarhad. (e) Arms and Ammunition. —The Qashgais are well armed. It is computed that there are in the tribe at least 20—25,000 modern s nail-bore magazine rifles (chiefly Mausers), During the operations against the Qashgais' in May and June 1918 no black powder was observed and all wounds were small-bore C. S. W. During these same operations the enemy was plentifully supplied with ammunition. Their expenditure was considerable and it is possible that their stock may now have run short. After recent experience,, however, it is obviously a mistake to reckon on a shortage of ammunition. At the same time, this recent heavy expen diture must have drawn considerably on their reserves and the amount of ammunition they have been able to import from the Gulf during the last few years has been negligible. (f) Fighting wdwe.—Ample opportunity was afforded by the operations against the Qashgais near Shiraz in May, June and July 1918 to observe their fighting characteristics. The Qashgai has a reputation for bravery which he did not belie ♦Since die ! of influenza in dl ™g these operations. 1 The tribesmen them- Shiraz in October 1918. selves Jook upon Mohammed* Ali Khan Kashkuh, Mohammed Khan, Hojabr Ashair22 (killed in action in September 1918). Haidar Agha Darashuri and Zalfaghar Agha Darasturi as their bravest men. The Darashuris, Kashkulis, Farsimadans, Shishbulukis, Safi Khanis and Ghallehzan Oghris are regarded as the ‘ £ warrior clans. ’ ’ Mobility is the Qashgais’strong point. At the first sign of a retirement, hills which were apparently empty of tribesmen, will swarm with sowars and footmen, all moving at their utmost pace. The Qashgai rides light and will force his horse to an “ all out ” gallop over the roughest ground. These ponies are small and wiry and will climb hills which would appear well night impossible. In the fighting round Shiraz it was found advantageous to keep fire fights at ranges of 7-800 yards. In this way Lewis and machine guns inflicted considerable casualties on the enemy, with comparatively small loss, as the Qashgai is a poor marksman at ranges over 500 yards. On several occasions the Darashuri horsemen charged in mounted, firing from horseback. On reaching to within 40 or 50 yards of their enemy they wheel and gallop back to their jumping off point. . Enveloping tactics are much practised by them and they will, wherever possible, attempt to out flank an enemy. The Qashgai does not dig himself in but utilizes any natural cover he can find (on the crest of a hill for preference) or constructs sangars. _ (g) Organization. —The supreme chief of the whole &lt;£ II ” is the “ Ilkkani, appointed by the Central Government and responsible to them for the collection and payment of revenue. Under the Ilkhani and responsible to him for the ££ interior economy ” of the tribe is the ££ Ilbegi, ” (always a relative). These two must be of direct descent from the Shahilu clan. Each sub-tribe has its Kalantar (or chief) appointed by the Ilkhani and nominally subservient to him. In practice, however, the Kalantars are often so powerful as to be able to defy the Ilkhani and remain aloof in an attitude of passive hostility. Intrigues and counter-intrigues are rife amongst the various heads of the sub-tribes and for this reason concerted action by the whole £ £ II ” need seldom be reckoned with. The present Ilkhani is Ahmad Khan, Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, Sardar Ehtesham, He is half-brother to the late Ilkhani, Soulat ed-Dowleh and full-brother to Ali Kuan, Solar Hishmut : the new Ilbegi. Salar Hishmat was appointed Ilbegi by His Highness Prince Farman Farma, Governor General of Fars, on 3rd July 1918. Up to some 10 days before this date Ali Khan had been fighting for the Soulat against the British. He was in command of the Qashgai force which opposed the column of Indian troops between Deh Sheikh and Khaneh Khabis on the 25th May 1918. As a result of negotia tions conducted by Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk, Ali Khan agreed to come over and join his brother the Sardar Ehtesham.23 (J) • . Two days later (5tli July 1918) Sardar Ehtesliam was appointed Ilkhani. (See appendix “ A ” foi; table of the Qashgai Khans.) (Ji) Revenue assessment'of the “ II ’’.—The total revenue due from the Ilkhani of the Qashgais to the Central Government is estimated at Krans 288,028 per annum. In addition to this a sum of 15,000 Tomans yearly is paid to the Governor General of Ears, making a total of Krans 438,028 or approximately 45,000 Tomans. The actual taxes paid by the tribesmen far exceed this sum. It is said that the total sum collected from the £ ‘ II ” by the Kalantars of the sub-tribes reaches 800,000 Tomans, of which 2—300,000 Tomans reaches the Ilkhani. Taxation. —A tax of one to one and a half Krans is levied per head of sheep. Male sheep are not taxed. Other cattle are taxed proportionately, one horse or camel being equal to 10 sheep, and one cow or donkey to 5 sheep. These taxes are collected when the tribes are assembled for migration, either in the spring or in the autumn. The Amaleh, or personal following of the Ilkhani and his family, are not taxed but their payments in kind probably amount to as much or more than they would pay in taxation. The nature of the services rendered by the Amaleh is varied. Fighting men must be provided, all building and repair work must be done free of charge, supplies of all sorts and fuel must be provid ed for the Ilkhani and his family. In short, all that the Ilkhani may desire must be provided, if available, by his Amaleh. (i) Manners and Customs. —“ The Qashgais are nomadic, not only by traditional custom but also because their tribal wealth and food supply depends so largely on their flocks and herds that the necessity of leaving the ‘ hot regions ’ before the grazing in the valleys has been dried up by the hot spring sun of southern Ears, and of seeking fresh pastures on the high plateaux of Northern Ears, is imperative, while the climate of the Sarhadd is too bitter during the winter months, and far more firewood can be obtained in the hills of the Garmsir. Their sheep and goats not only provide milk, meat and clarified fat, which are staple items of their food, but the wool and hair is used by the tribes for weaving their own tents and coverings, and carpets for sale in the towns, from which source each tent derives a portion of its yearly income. The Qashgai sell few lambskins (and therefore kill few lambs) in comparison with the Arab tribes : and in some ‘ tirehs ’ the poorest tribesmen are said to own 300 animals. Sheep too find a large sale among the settled inhabitants of the south during the winter season. ’ ’ ? In the Garmsir the Qashgais do not camp in large numbers in the open valleys. Their stay in the Garmsir lasts some 7 months. They, therefore, select secluded valleys and ravines on the hillside as protection against the winter weather and in order to be near water. In these spots small ‘ ‘ clumps ’ ’ of tents may be seen, in numbers according to the accommodation of the site chosen.24 In the Sarhad, however, large encampments of as many as 400 tents may be seen in the open. ‘ ‘ The enormous extent of country occupied by the Qashgais and their distribution in sparse units, not only prevent the tribe accumulating in any one place in more than a fraction of their real strength,” but would also make military operations against the tribes as a whole a matter of great difficulty. “ The Qashgais resemble the Liir nomads of South West Persia but many minor points of difference present themselves. ” Their language is a dialect of Turki though most of the tribesmen can understand and speak Persian. ‘ ‘ In appearance they compare fairly with their Lur compatriots : they seem on the whole to be taller and fairer than the Bakhtiaris, and certainly more so than Lurs. In religion they are more orthodox and less superstitious than their Lur neighbours. ” “ Ali Illahis will not be found among them and Imamzadehs, Qadamgahs, and PIrs are as noticeable by their rarity in Qashgai country as by their frequency in Luristan and Eakhtiari. ’ ’ (j). Migrations. —“ The migrations of the Qashgais differ little from those of other nomad tribes. ’ 5 Their principal transport animals are camels and donkeys. Mules are scarce and only used by the Khans. “ The migration takes place twice a year, once up-country and once down, and varies to the extent of very few days. About the vernal equinox, or Nauruz, they commence to strike their black tents and move slowly north ; they leave their northern pastures rather before the middle of September, and come back to their old camping grounds in the south. Their summer quarters, known as the ‘ Sarhad, ’ or Yailaq, are near the northern boundary of Pars, west of Qumisheh and Yazd-i-Khast, and reach to the eastern slope of the Kuh-i-Denna (the Kuhgalu tribes being on the north-west of this range); their winter quarters are in the Garmsir or hot regions of Pars, ranging from the vicinity of Bebbehan to near Lar, but never south of the range of moun tains bordering the coastline, that is to say, generally, more that 40 miles inland as the crow flies.” “ The principal route is that adopted by the Darashuri, Kashkuli and others, who, coming from Behbehan and the Mahur-i-Mailatun district, respectively, strike the Shiraz-Bushire post road in the neighbourhood of Kazerun and follow the general trend of this route as far as Dasht-i-Arjan and Khaneh Zinian, whence they either proceed via Chinar Rahdar, and cross the Shiraz plain to Cuyum and Baiza, or more direct to Ardakan.” “ Prom the latter point they disperse by various routes to their summer quarters. 5 ’ A few tribes previously used the Tang-i-Allah-o-Akbar, /25 north of Shiraz, but this is not usual now, the whole “ II ” keeping well to the west of Shiraz. “ Tribes coming from Galehdar 5 Ala Marvdasht, Afzar, etc., generally pass through Chinar ftahdar on their way up-country.” , The migration of the Ilkhani and his Amaleh, or ‘ household troops,’ is as shown in Appendix ‘ c G. ” “ Generally speaking, the downward migration of the whole II converges on Baiza and Guyum to the north of Shiraz and then divides, ’the Daraskuri, Kashkuli, Farsi madan going off towards Shahpur or Dasht-i-Arjan, while the Shishbmuki and many smaller tribes, the Ilkhani and his adherents, strike south via Jerreh, Farashband, Khajai and Firuzabad.” The route of migration may slightly change from year to year if the supply question necessitates it. The general route, however, rarely changes. As far as possible the tribes avoid the main roads and villages, and camp in such places as provide good grazing for their numreous flocks. The date of the commencement of the northward migration depends upon the crops which have been sown in the Garmsir and which must be harvested before the whole of the tribe earn leave foi the Sarhao.. Thus, though the first tents are struck shortly after Nauruz, it maybe anything from 10 to 40 days after this date before the last of the tribe moves. Details of the migration of each tribe are given in the table of sub-tribes. (£) Tribal Sections.— ' It is a well-known tradition that the Qashgai were from the beginning 44 ‘ tirehs ’ (branches or clans). Some of these have almost disappeared, and others have dwindled to a few tents. Some ‘ tirehs ’ have been merged into larger branches : in times of stress large bodies of the Qashgai have gone over to the Bakhtiari county, or, in a less degree, to the Khamesh tribes, and become identified with those ^ I Severity on the part of the Ilkhanis or partisan jealousies in the ‘ tireh ’ itself are often—even now-a-days—the cause of secessions. On the other hand, many of the e tirehs ’ are to-day composed of elements in which little of the original Qashgai stock can be traced, and much new blood has been imported. Thus the present ruling family of the Kashkuli clan came fr&lt; m the Zend tribe, originating from near Kirmanshah. The Fars tribe called Bulwardi, ‘ Arab ’ tribes like Nafar and Kuhgalu Lurs are to be found scattered amongst and incorporated in the Qashgai. Peasantry from a certain district w r ill attach themselves to the clan frequenting tne district, and small sedentary tribes like the Turkseliu, Gunaki and Maslari, near Maimand, have been taken under the patronage of the Qashgai and v r ill no doubt in time become completely absorbed.” The following list has been arrived at by comparing all existing lists with a list given by a Qashgai, who for 30 years was “ Mobdsher or • ^ Super intendent and Registrar ” of the Qashgai II This man has an intimate knowledge of Qashgai affairs and the following list may be accepted as approxi mately correct:— C305GSB *41 Details of the Sub -tribes. A. The Darashuris. Origin.—This tribe originally migrated from Turkestan and settled in the Bu uk of Garmabad in the “ Barash ur ” valley. Hence their name. Strength.—In point of view of strength and tribal wealth the Darashuris are the first of the Qashgai tribes. They number 5 6,000 families and can raise about 3,000 sow'ars and 2,000 footmen. Their sowars are renowned for their mobility. Fighting strength and qualities .-—This tribe can raise a maximum of 3,000 sowars and 2,000 footmen and would probably reach this figure should their tribal existence be threatened. The ilkhani, however, can only rely upon levying 1,500—2,0JO fighting men from them. The Darashuri sowar is renowned for his prowess and mobility. Their horses are of a good stamp, will travel fast over rough country and are ac customed to pick up a living from the country they are passing through. [See also paragraph (/), page 21.] Chiefs .—The present chief of the Darashuris is Aiyaz Kikha. He was actively hostile to the British during the fighting near Shiraz in 1918. He was not present with the section of his tribe which attacked Khaneh Zin an post but on arrival, after tile attack, sent insolent letters to the Officer Com manding the post. He Was hostile to the new regime until the Tf)th October 1918 when lie submitted to Aii Khan, libegi. The following is a table of the Darashuri ruling Khans :— Haji Ali Panah Kikha. i /. • • • | ' i Haji Baba. Kazim Kikha. Agha Kikha. K •• 1 ' f Ali Panah Kikha. * ( \ ^ “A Gudarz Kikha. Aiyaz Kikha. . Vali Khan Nawrullah Kikha. Khan, (died 19181. Ahmad Khan. Ali Panah Kikha assists Aiyaz Kikha in the Governorship of the tribe but they are not alw'ays on the best of terms. “ For a short time Soulat-ed-Dowleh made Ali Panah Kikha Kalantar of the Darashuiis, and deposed Aivaz Kikha, but iu 1911 .Aiyaz Kikha threw in his lot with Soulat-ed-Dowleh, took the bulk of his large clan to the Soulat’s winter quarters in Qir-o -Kama and in the spring of 1912 fought for the ex Ilkhani against Zaigham and other clans. 5 Ha'htat .—The Darashuxi garmsir is east and south-east of Eehbehar and their sarhad in Vardasht and Garmabad (near Simarum) . Migration. —The Darashuri migration from garmsir to sarhad is via Sar Abnaniz, Marg, Shapur, the Kazerun district, thence via the bhahi road to C305GSB 1 Q „44 The most noted of these Zend or Kashimli Khans was Qasim Khan, who died in the year of the British war. He was responsible for the branch finding a new habitat in the mountains, from Shapur to Haiat Daud, for the Kashku.is had not spread to that side before. The descendants of his brother Haji Abbas Ali are still settled in the direction of Gallehdar andQir o-Karun, and the tribe is apparently known not as Kashkuii but as (Afshar) Kirmani. All Kashkulis meet round the Kuh-Mihr (Qumair 1) in the summer. Qasim Khan and his brothers had a numerous progeny, so that the Khans say that of their grandfathers’ descendants they can muster 100 riflemen.” Strength.—Hhz families composing the Kaslikuii tribe were originally much less numerous than they are now. In the course of time considerable numbers of families of Mamassani origin have joined the Kaslikuii confederacy, bringing the tribe up to its present strength of some 4,000 families. They are said to be able to raise 4,000 armed men but the Ilkhani could not rely upon more than 1,000. Chiefs .—Mohajnmad All Khan, Zargham Ashair, chief of the Kashkuii tribe (see additions to “ YVdio's Who in Persia ” enclosed under General Staff, Shiraz No. lC5-15-G of 11th February 1918) was deposed by Soukvt-ed-Dowleh in the autumn of 1917 who appointed Amrullah Khan (son of the late If. M. Karim Khan) and Abul Fath Khan (nephew* of H. M. Karim Khan) as joint Kalantars. . Abul Fath Khan was consistently hostile to the British during the Shiraz operations in summer 1918 and was with Nasr Diwan when lie occupied the Shiraz valley. Amrullah Khan is a youth of about 23 years of age who speaks fair English and who has been steadily friendly to us. He has several times expressed a wish to take a commission in the South Persia Rifles. Since the deposition of the Soulat Mohd. Ali Khan has come into his own and is now* again recognised as Chief of the Kashkulis. He is renowned amongst the Qashgais for his personal bravery. He is of the “ brigand chief- te n type—=-a heavily built man with fiercely curling moustaches and a high o] in on of his own importance. His intelligence, however, is not of the highest order. (Died of influenza in October 1918 in Shiraz). Mohammad Khan, (Hojabr Ashair) who was formerly joint Kalantar with Mohd. Ali Khan died of wounds received while fighting against Soulateu- Dowleh in September 1918. Haji Mohd. Karim Khan, Kashkuii—the patriarch of the Qashgais—died in May 1918. A table of the Genealogy of the Kashkuii Khans is attached. Habitat.— The Kashkulis were originally a Fars tribe pure and simple i.e., their winter quarters were in Fars, between Jabmm and Lar.” Qasiin Khan, Zend was originally responsible for the tribe finding their present winter quarters, which are in Mai ur-i-Mailatun and Khist. Their sarliad is in the districts of Kuhmair, Kakan, Ardakan and Haft Barm. *47 C.—The Farsimadan.

Son of Darab Khan, ILkhani and a Kashkuli mother. 40 years of age. In 1898, Soulat, through the influenee of Habibullah Khan (son of Mohummad Reza Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk), was appointed joint jibegi with Bahadur Khan. At this time Soulat-ed-Dowleh was possessed of no property of any description. By raising loans he was enabled to travel to the Sarhad and take charge of the tribes. He for some time refused to hand over half of the tribes to Bahadur Khan as joint Ilbegi, whereupon the latter threatened to go oven to Zargham-ed-Dowleh. In fear that this threat might be put into execution, Soulat handed over to Bahadur Khan the Shishbuluki, Bulii and Qallehzan tribes. In 1900 Moiyed-ed-Dowleh became Governor General of Ears and Habibullah Khan again bestirred himself in the interests of the Soulat, with the result that the latter was appointed sole Ilbegi of the Qasbgai II. (It was at this epoch that Ismail Khan first obtained the title of Soulat-ed-Dowleh). In 1901 when Shu’a-es-Saltaneh was nominated Governor General of Ears, Zargham- ed-Dowleh obtained a hearing and had Soulat-ed-Dowleh deposed from the Ilkhaniship and nominated Governor of Behbehan, and he himself became libegi. Shortly after this Soulat commenced an intrigue with Qawam-ul-Mulk and Habibullah Khan by which they were to unite with Zargham-ed-Dowleh and combine against Shu’a-es-Saltaneh. Soulat-ed-Dowleh himself disclosed the whole of this plot to Shu’a-es-Saltaneh with the result that Muhammad Reza Khan, Qawam-ul-Mulk was assassinated and Zargham-ed- Dowleh was later poisoned. SoulaBed-Dowleh was re-appointed Ilbegi by Shu’a-es-Saltaneh and was eventually made Hkham by Zill-es-Sultan when he was Governor General of Ears The Souht remained Ilkhani from that date until July 1918, with the exception of a short interval in 1911 when Sardar Ehtesham was Ilkhani. , , r n July 1918 Soulat-ed-Dowleh was deposed from the Ilkhaniship at the instigation of the Bntish authorities after the fighting between the Soulat’s froces and the Indian troops. (ii) Ahmad Khan, Sardctr Ehtesham. Son of Darab Khan by Shah Nesa Khanum (who was the daughter of a servant of Darab Khan). Full brother to Ah Khan, Salar Hishmat (libegi) and half-brother to Soulat-ed-Dowleh, than whom he is 6 months older. Appointed Ilkhani in July 1918 in succession to Soulat after the fighting near Shiraz. Has twice before been appointed Ilkhani but with no success. He is not of anv great strength of character and, therefore, not likely to be a great success as ^hani J S APPENDIX 0.

In Simarum, Hanna, Vanak, Hunajan and Padenna the Shah maund is used. The old Nasr-ud-Din 20 miscal kran is sometimes to be found in the Simarum dis- trict. The Qashgai woman affects gold sequins when obtainable. Amongst these were formerly many gold coins of the ancient kings. These have mostly disappeared now having been purchased by antiquarians. APPENDIX D. Archaeological. The writer has no personal knowledge of any archaeological remains in Qashgai country but local report has it that there are many such remains to be found. The ruins of an ancient city, called by the Qashgais Shahr-i-Simah, still exist near the Tang-i-Shirvau, four farsags from Afzar. In this same district are many large stones known by the natives as Filband because, they say, these stones were used in the days of the ancient kings to tie up their elephants. In Afzar is a small hill known as the Qaleh Gelli which is believed to have b‘een the site of the throne of the old Afzar Kings. Near Firuzabad are the ruins of an ancient city which contains “ the ruins of the ear liest existing Sasanian palace, which is believed to date from the middle of the third century A.D. or even earlier ” (see Sir Percy Sykes’ History of Persia, Vol. I, page 509). Ancient coins are still discovered near this palace. In Shapur (Kasbkuli country) ruins are still to be found, including “ the only Persian statue known to exist ” (see Sir Percy Sykes’ History of Persia, Vol. I, page 314). In the Qashgai Sarhad there are still evidences of ancient cities, many pillars still standing intact. APPENDIX E. Mineralogical. Nothing definite can be ascertained with regard to minerals in the Qashgai country. There is a considerable mine of salt near DehEud and Panj Shir, and the Qashgais themselves believe that there is much mineral wealth in both Farhad and Garmslr. Dr. Pilgrim of the Geological Survey of India does not consider that the Garmslr is likely to contain much in the way of mineral w'ealth. APPENDIX F. Agriculture. Shortly before leaving the Sarhad the “ Shatvi ” or autumn crop is sown and watered and is then left in the charge of such inhabitants of the district as are under the influence of the Ilkhani. This grain is ready for reaping shortly after the return of the tribes to the Sarhad at the beginning of the following summer. In the Garmslr the “ Shatvi ” crop is sown immediately after the first fall of rain and is reaped before the tribe leaves for the Sarhad in the following spring. Part of this harvest is left behind in store for use on their re-arrival in flu* Garmslr and part is taken with the tribes for supplies en route and to last over until the Sarhad crops are reaped.57 : The Mamassani. (a) Origin and History.-- Mam'assani is a contraction of Mohammad Hassa- ni. One Mohammad Hassan is said to have been the founder of the tribe. There appears to be some doubt as to who this Mohammad Hassan was. Some of the tribesmen say he originally came from Arabia, while others maintain that he came from Dashtistan. 1 At one time-the Mamassani country included Dushmanziari and Fahlian. The former however has now become the property of the Qawam-ul-Mulk and the latter the property of Nasir-ul-Mulk (both by”purchase). In 1897 the SS ; “ Arabistan,” one of the Anglo-Arabian Steam Ship Com pany’s boats, containing a large consignment of arms and ammunition, the pro pel ty of Tracis, Times and Company, Livingstone, Muir and Company, and A. and T. J. Malcolm of Bushirc and Asfar and Company of Basrah ; also Agha Haji Mohammad Moin-ut-tujjar of Bushire, Haji Seyecl Ismail Shahbankarehi and his half-brother and Haji Nasir Behbehani was seized in the Persian Gulf by a British gunboat (the “ Sphinx ”) and confiscated (and ultimately handed over to the Persian Government.) Tracis, Time and Company, Livingstone, Muir and Company, A. and T. J. Malcolm and A far and Company, represented this matter to the British autho rities but lostjdieir case and received no compensation. Haji Agha Moham mad, Moin-ut-Tujjar, Haji Seyed Ismail Shahbankarehi and his half-brother and Haji Nasir Behbehani, by bribing the Persian Government, obtained the Mamassani lands (at that time Crown property) as compensation. Moin-ut- Tu ii a,r ecemuady bought out Shahbankarehi and Behbehani, thus becoming sole owner of the Mamassani country. The chief Kalantar, appointed by the owner is Abdul Hassan Khan, who is responsible to tne owner for the collection of the revenues which are paid to the Pars Administration through Haji Gholam Ali, Behbehani (a prominent merchant of Slnraz and agent in Shiraz for Moin-ut-Tuj jar). _ (Abdul Hassan Khan, the Kalantar of Mamassani, was originally a Kaze- runi, resident for some years in Bushire, where he was chief munshi to Had Moin-ut-Tujjar). • * ^ ' Jj In 191G Mo’aven-ut-Tujjar (son of Haji Moin-ut-Tujjar) farmed these lands on behalf of his father to Soulat-ed-Dowleh. After this date no revenue was paid until after the arrival of the Farman Farina in Pars, since when Haji Gholam Ali Behbekani has been paying reve nue on behalf of Haji Moin-ut-Tujjar. The Mamassanis are said to be of mixed origin having come from Behbe- 1 an, Pusht-i-Kuh, Arabistan and as far north as the Boir Ahmadi country These people nominated 3 chiefs viz., Bakesh Ali, Javid Ali and Rustam! Hence the names of the present main divisions of the tribe— (i) Bakesh. (ii) Javidi (or Jowi). (in) Rustanl. C305CSB L /58 As these sections became stronger they were again sub-divided into smaller sections and a Katkhoda appointed for each. These Katkhodas were originally descendants of the 3 first chiefs. (6) Boundaries —The Mamassani country is bounded on the north by the district of Easht, on the south by Dushmanziari country, on the east by Ar- dakan and on the west by Margh and Gur-spid. (The exact location of these two latter places is doubftul). The country lies roughly in the area covered by D. S. 10-N, square B-3 and 4 ; C-4 and D-4. (c) Language .—The tribesmen speak a dialect of Lhri-Persian which differs little from ordinary colloquial Persian. The Kalantars and Katkhodas all speak a correct Persian in addition to the dialect of the district. (c?) Characteristics .—The Mamassani, like the Qashgai, is dark skinned. Above the average height and of excellent physique, he is a lover of sport and all out-door pursuits. Formerly a notorious robber, the Mamassani has of recent years adopted a more peaceful agricultural life. Their country is on the whole prosperous and well governed. The Mamassani is sedentary within his own boundaries. The Rustam and Javidi sections move a short distance to villages which have the advantage of a slightly better climate during the summer. There is, howevSr, no organis ed tribal migration. The religion is orthodox Shiah and the Mamassani has the reputation of being meticulous in his religious observances. (e) Strength .—The Kalantar of the Mamassani estimates the total strength of the 3 sections at 13,500 souls, as follows :—■ Souls. Rustam .. .. .. .. .. .. 6,000 Bakehs .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 4,000 Javidi .. .. .. .. .. .. 3,500 Total .. 13,500 'Rid? fighting strength is estimated (by their own Kalantar) at 2,000 tufang- chis and 230 sowars. There is no means of checking this estimate. (/) Fighting qualities. —The Mamassani has a reputation for bravery and stamina, and is said to be a good rifle shot. {g) Arms and Ammunition.—No definite information available, but the tribe is said to be well armed. Ammunition is short. (h) Revenue.—The revenue assessment of the tribe is 7,000 tomans per year, paid by the Kalantar to the owner’s agent in Shiraz, who in turn pays it to the Revenue Administration of Pars for transmission to the Government. Against this the following taxes are levied on the tribesmen (i) l of the winter crop. (ii) | of the summer crop.62 The Lashani. («)• Origin.— The Lashanis were originally a sub-tribe of the Qashgai II” but in the year 1871 Haji Mo’atamed-ed-Dowleh, who was then Governor General of Ears, entrusted the Governorship of Abadeh-Tashk and Sarchahan to one Mohammad Hussan Khan, his nephew, and separated the tribe from the Qashgais. After Haji Mo’ataraed-ed-Dowleh’s governorship one Haji Hakim Bashi, Hafez-us-Sehheh, having bought considerable property in the neighbourhood of Abadeh-Tashk, was made Governor of Lashan. This man is the ancestor of the present owner, Fakhr-es-Saltaneh (Sardar Fakhr). (b) . Habitat. — The Lashanis are divided into two sections, both sedentary the one living in Khafrak and the other in Abadeh Tashh (c) . Strength.— Lashanis number about 1,500 families and can turn out possibly 1,500 fighiing men. (d) . Arms and Ammunition— This tribe is not well armed and not well supplied with ammunition. During the fighting in September 1917 it was computed that about 50% of their arms were small bore rifles and the remainder Martinis, etc. Ammunition was scarce. (e) . Characteristics .—The Lashanis have for many years been renown ed as the most daring robber tribe in Ears province, their expeditions taking them as far as Khorasan province. The tribe previously lived almost solely on the proceeds of robbery, which had become so fixed a habit with the young men of the tribe that the chiefs had very little hold over them. In the autumn of 1917 a column of Indian troops was sent against the Lashanis who were severely punished, the whole of their forts being destroyed and their villages burni'. Since this time robbery has practically ceased and the tribe is now settling to an agricultural life. During the summer months the tribesmen live in tents which are, however, pitched near the houses occupied by them during the winter. (/). Organisation.—The “Landlord” of Lashan is Fakhr-es-Saltaneh (or Sadar Fakhr) resident in Teheran and for years bitterly antagonistic to the English. He has two agents in Shiraz who are responsible to him for Lashani aflairs:— Baha-es-Sultan and Mnshar-ed-Dowleh. Of these the first named was aurested by the British authorities in Shiraz in July 1918 on a charge of intriguing against them. The charge was substantiated before His Highness Prince Farman Farma who agreed to have Baha-es-Sultan deported from Ears province.64 Bahmanwand. Oulad Sheikh Ali. Oulad Amir Agha. The following 3 “ lirehs ” are also now attached to the Bahmanwand, though they pay their revenue direct to the Government. (i) . Molhak. (ii) . Tolamaki. (in.) Kushkaki. The Mishmast Tribe. Authority. — Captain A. N. I. Lilly, 7th K?j|ut a , Commandant, Abadeh, 4th February 1917 to 10th January 1918. (а) . Strength. — 2-300 families. (б) . Habitat .— The Mishmasts are an indigenous tribe, but live almost entirely in tents on the Arsinjan plain round about Arsinjan itself. Certain sections of the tribe occasionally take up their quarters on the Saadatabad and Saidun plains, more especially in winter. Two villages within 5 miles of Ar sinjan, Fijan and Paniran (not marked on D. S.) are reported to be their head quarters. (c) . Arms and Ammunition. — Reported to be well armed with Mauser and other small bore rifles (very few Martinis). A great number of rifles belong ing to the late Gendarmerie are said to be now in the possession of this tribe. They are reported to have some 200 rifles and are generally well supplied with ammunition. (d) . Leaders. —The tribe is divided into two sections, each with its own Kalantar. (i) . Mir Ismail, a “ rish-sefid .” is nominally the Kalantar of one section but his son Mir Agha Khan, who is a well known robber, is the real Kalantar. (ii) - The Kalantar of the other section is Hasel Khan, also a well known robber. The following men are said to be the leaders in the tribe’s robbing opera tionsMohamed Ali Khan, Ali Akbar, Ghulam Hussein, Amir, Rajab, Ali, Reza, Davood Khan, Najaf (nephew of Mir Agha Khan) and Haidar Beg. The last named in particular has a great reputation as being a very smart and daring robber and runs a small band whose members call themselves “ Hassan Sowars.” A small section of the tribe under the leadership of one Rahim lives with the Lashani tribe. Rahim is the leader of a band of about 30 mounted robbers in conjunction with the Lasnanis. '{p). Fighting value.—From all reports tlie fighting value of the Mish- masts would appear to be considerably higher than that of other robber tribes of a simdar size, though they would probably not put up much of a fmht against an organised force b (/). General Characteristics.—As already mentioned the Mishmasta (or a certain section of the tribe) join the Lashanis in the latters robbing expeditions, and they also, on occasions undertake combined operations with the Kurdshulis. They are also on good terms with the Cheharrahi, Tutaki (robber tribes m the Bavanat district) and Feraghehi (an offshoot of the Bakhtiari) livmo- in the Abrquh district. ° Since the operations against the Lashanis in September and October 1917 this tribe has not been to the fore in raiding expeditions. Previously their favourite haunts for robbing expeditions were Qisri Dasht, Saltaneh Karam (between Sivand and Qawamabad), Tang-i-Bulaghi, Tang-i-Kamin, SivamL Saidun and occasionally on the Madar-i-Sulaiman plain. The Boir Ahmadi. {a). Origin.—' This tribe is the most important of the Chehar Bunicheh group of Kuhgalu tribes, which also includes the Churam N U yi and Bavi,all of which are con idered to belong to the Pusht-i-Kuh division of the Kuhgalu • though settlements of the Boir Ahmadi are to be found round Behbehan. ’ Tribal tradition has it that the Boir Abmadi are descended from one Malik-ut-Tujjar of Isfahan. Until 1907 they were more or less united under Karim Khan, Bahadur-ed-Dowleh, but on his death they reverted to the usual tribal feuds. ” (&amp;/. Habitat .—With the exception of the Mulla Qobad section, which is sedentary round Sisakht, the sarhad and garmsir of this tribe is :— Sarhad. —Tal-i-Khosrow, Sar Rud, Sisakht, Chinar Dasht-i-Rum Safid Dar, Kuh-i-Dil and Yazak. Garmsir .—In the district east of Behbehan and north west of Mamas- sani country. In “ Sunkarabad, Qalat, Deh Dasht and Suk-i-Changalwar '—(Wilson). (c). Chiefs. —Their principal chiefs, each with a fairly large following, are Shukrullah Khan, Karim Khan, Qaid Mohammad Ali and Mulla - Q, j bad. {d). Strength .—It would appear that their numbers are somewhat larger than those given in the Military Report on Fars (page 42). caasasB66 T^e fobowin' figures are given by Captain A. N. I. Lilly, 7th Bajputs, who was commanding Abadek m 1917 and who came into more or less close touch with the Boir Ahmadis ' Families, j Fighting men. Shukndlah Khan controls .. •• 2,600 1,600 (This chief is also regarded as the chief IValantar of the Boir Ahmadi).

During 1918, however, they have been much less active. The Eoir Ahmadi has a reputation for pluck and stamina and he is much more feared by those w r ho come in contact with him than are the Q shgais or Arabs. The Boir Ahmadi footmen are renowned for their mobility and are said to be able to move 70—80 miles in a day. The following characteristics are remarked upon by Captain Lilly. *' Facts worth noting are that (i) There is continual enmity between the Karim Khan section and the Shukrullah Khan section. (ii) The followers of Quid Mohammad Ali are very friendly with the Sisakhtis under Mulla Qobad and often carry out raids in con* junction with them. ■ “ The Boir Ahmadis have comparatively few mounted men and should con- seauently be easier to deal with as far as the protection of the road is con cerned, especially as they invariably attack caravans at certain well known points. 5 Their favourite localities for robbing operations are as follows (i) In the Yezd district and along the Yezd-Isfahan road. (ii) Between Aminabad and Isfahan, especially near Maksud Beg, Asiab Chah (midway between Qumisheh and Mehiar), Mehar and the Urchin pass. ' h (Hi) Gaud-i-Gir (midway between Aminabad and Yezd-i-Khast) wtieh they reach via Hanna (D.S. 10 M., D.-4) and a pass through the hills about 8 miles west of Yezd-i-Khast. (iv) Betwen Bijdaneh and Tarsah, which they reach via Dehgerdu (where they usually halt for the night—D.S. 17-A., A.-4) and through the hills 5 miles west of the road, either by the lang-i* AUah-ed-Dowleh or the Tang-i-Tarsah.67 (v) Between Tul-i-Siyah and Bid Alain, wliich they reach via Deligerdu and the Tang-i-Bid Ala in. -—4 Note—These parses through tlr; hilli are not mark d on D. S. 17-A. (w) Quli Kush pass and Kuh-i-Jangi (3 miles south of Khan-i-Khurreh) but they have not been found to rob in this locality during the last four years* (vii) Tang-i-Mian Mulla (between Meshed-i-Murghab and Khan-i- Khergun). They very rarely rob in this locality (last occasion in 1915), and now that this road has been closed to caravans they are even less likely to appear in this direction. It is improbable that they will attack the Qidrabad road as there is no good track through the hills east of the Mian Mulla pass and, even in the event of their successfully raiding a caravan on that road, they would be hampered in getting away with their booty- owing to having to cross the Pulvar River. ‘ The Boil* Ahmadis do not carry out raids after the Qoshgais have taken up their summer quarters and their robbing operations are consequently confined to cert a n periods of the year, viz. :— In the S-prirg. —After the snow on the passes (particularly on the Gardan- i-Bezan) has melted and until the Q ishgais come up, i.e. between the end of March and the middle of May. In the Aviv inn .—After the Qashgais go down and until the passes become blocked by snow, he. from the end of September until the end of November, or middle of December (if weather is favourable). “ Size of robber bands.—Muck larger than either Qashgai or Arab bands. 'Seldom less'than 100 strong and sometimes as many as 3-400, a very small proportion (about 10 per cent) being mounteu. “ n curious procedure the Bear Ahma’dis are said to adopt occasionally is to send a dozen footmen, armed only with reavy sticks, along the road. These start a quarrel with the charvadars of the particular caravan tney vim to rob (generally at some fixed point) and, in the middle of the resulting fight and confusion, the main body of the robbers suddemy appeals on the scene and chives oh the laden animals. 6. Sub-tribes.—The following list of sub-tribes-is given by Captin A. T. Wilson in his Military Report on Ears (1916): Amalehjat Kagawai. \ i ■. Aq ai. Kurrai. Shaikh Abil. AuladMirza Ali.

(Wilson.\Thz Dushmonzidri. (a) Origin .—This tribe until July 1917 was a branch of the Mamassani. The Dushmanziari lands were purchased in July 1917 fromHaji Said-es- Saltaneh (whose “ taiyul :J it was) by His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk for 33,000 tomans. This purchase much incensed Soulat-ed-Dowleh who “ farms ” Mamassani country which is adjacent to Dushmanzsaii country. (b) . Strength .—A. Dushmanziari chief Kalantar (Jehangir Khan) esti mates the tribe at 2,000 families. His Excellency the Qawain states that it was reported to him at “ more than 1,000”. The figure reported to the Q a warn would naturally be much under the actual strength with a view to keeping down the revenue. 1,500 families is probably an approximately correct estimate. (c) . Fighting Strength.—This tribe can probably turn out some 1,500 fighting men. They are described as a warlike tribe and well armed. Nothing definite is known as to their arms and ammunition. (d) . Sub-tribes .—The list of sub-tribes given by Jehangir Khan differs entirely from the list given in the Gazetteer of Persia, Voume III, part 1, page 304. Jehangir Khan states that this tribe have now become sedentary villagers and are known by the names of the villrges they inhabit, viz. Village. Families. Fifhtikg Men. Sowars. Tufangchis.
