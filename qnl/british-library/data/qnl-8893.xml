He also returns the papers Pelly had sent him.The letter appears to be dated 22 May, but as Pelly's first letter to Lord Salisbury on the matter is dated 23 May this date seems unlikely.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023440651.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
