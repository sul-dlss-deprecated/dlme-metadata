M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- The following matter has been reported to me by the Police. On 21st December at about midnight some R.A.F. men came in a truck to Busateen village and removed a 20 feet long boat from the shore. The ov/ner, Said bin Ali, reported the loss to the Police after ascertaining that his boat was in the R.A.F. camp, near the village. Sub-Inspector Mahmood went to Busateen and made some enquiries and discovered that the boat was in the possession of an R.A.F. man working in the Dispensary. His name was Millard, his signature is on the attached slip. Sub- Inspector Mahmood was informed by Millard that he bought the boat for Rs. 120/- from a 'black man' whose identity was unknown. The boat is worth in the neighbourhood of Rs.300/-. Sub-Inspector Mahmood asked Millard to return the boat to its owner and to endeavour to identify the person who was alleged to have sold it. Millard refused to return the boat without receiving back its price. Owing to the circumstances under which the boat was removed it would appear that it was stolen or it was sold by a person to whom it did not belong. If the boat is returned it is not likely that its owner will wish to take further action but if it is not returned the Police are prepared to file a criminal case in court and to charge Millard with theft or being in possession of stolen property.

A. * I superintended the handing over the boat to its owner at 4 p.m. on the 27th of January. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed and the adjutant to the Air Liaison Officer were both present and I was able to question both Millard and the owner of the boat. It emerged quite clearly from Millard«s statement ’ that he is almost certainly guilty of the theft of the boat. rhe follow ing were the main discrepancies and improbabilities in his story.' (1) He hao soated at different times that he purchased the boa. for Ps. 120/- and for Ps. 200/-. In actual fact the current market price of the boat is approximately Rs. 300 /-jfc (2) He stated to the Air Liaison Officer that he collected ^ the boat at 9-30 p.m. and on this •occrasion he said that W he fetched the boat at 8 —.8-30 p.m. ^ ^ a i le f e ? that ’ with the hel P of another airman, he pulled ! the boat down to the sea. The boat is too heavy to be thus moved by two men. (4) He stated that he found the sails and rudder with the boat, whereas the other airman alleged to have been present said that there were no sails and rudder with the boat. The owner has never complained of losing sails and rudder which * are still m his possession. .Millard produced a sail and rudder, both of which were of an unusual make and had almost certainly been produced ,in the R.A.F. camp and not by local craftsmen. (5) The coat when it was stolen had been laid up for nearly two years and, unrer these circumstances, would almost certainly have sunk v/ithin a few minutes of being put in the water. (6) Millard's general bearing was guilty and the way he told his story most unconvincing. 2. The boat was left in the sea during a storm and has suffered damage which it will cost the owner nearly Ps.50/- to repair. As it seems that Millard is exceedingly lucky not to have been taken into court on a charge of theft, on which he would almost certainly be convicted^ I suggest that it is reason able that he should be asked to recompense the owner of the boat for the damage which it has suffered. 28-1-45. •a. r I'T'i Ui h IXsjf I-vl 3^^ iii, so \</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000217_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1800</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000217</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1800</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 36/61 Miscellaneous Correspondence with Military Officials and Station Commander, Bahrain'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-04-12T18:53:00</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (64 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 64; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
