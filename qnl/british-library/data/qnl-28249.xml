I am greatly indebted to Mr. Bird for his assistance in preparing it* Its lateness is principally due to the difficulty of obtaining information, especially statistics, from local authorities; I thought a late report would be better than an incomplete one* 2, For convenience of reference I have followed the order of last year , s report, though I think it might be improved. But I have succeeded in compressing it to about two-thirds the usual length, without I think omitting anything of importance. I have the honour to be. Sir, lour obedient servant. * tC Political Agent, Muscat* His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. MB*CQmiEOTIAL REPOKT OF TKf. TOR THF.

Saiyid Tariq bin Tainur, President of the Municipal Council has dons good deal to improve the standard off public hygiene, and there was a pronounced improvement over the last year. D.D.T. has been used to some extent in the Health Department's anti-malaria scheme. (b) The Agency Hospital remained open throughout the year. There yma a great increase in the work carried out by the Hospital owing to the absence of the staff from the American Mission Hospital at Muttra which was closed from September onwards. As the Assistant Agency Surgeon was with dr fawn in fey, 194# all this extra work fell on the shoulders of Dr. Matthews Table of attendances. 2243 • 1947 . Out door. 30,302. 23,981.

Though less in I c, 48 the illness was severe and in many oases Cerebral symptoms supervened with fatal results. Anti—Malaria treatment was given with Quinine, Mspacrlne aivi Arsenic. Paludrine was given as a preventative for the first tiins, and where patients took their treatment seriously good results were attained. Anti-lfelarla measures improved under the control of the Muscat Municipality and the inhabitants are yearly becoming more accustomed to preventative measures* Uloers, boils, skin, eye and ear diseases and Tonsilitis are at least as frequent as heretofore. The summer sets up a cycle of disease events. First prickly heat which often leads to Septic Prickly Heat and fiimlly to boils and uloers. Patients are treated with early oil lavage of the akin and later penicillin. Venereal diseases with Syphilis manifesting itself in divers imnners take a heavy toll of health and life. 60% of the poorer classes are Infected and treatment with Arsenic and Mercury are very unpopular whereas Penicillin supplies can never keep pace with the demand. L Bowel diseases2 . Bowel diseases and dysentery are on the increase owing to the millions ° f if) flies that invade Muscat during the date season. Half the population are said to have Tuberculosis but nothing oan be done for this unless a T.B. centre is set up. There ibs a number of heat stroke and heat exhaustlo} oases due to the very hot summer of this year and a campaign to encourage an Increase in salt intake had some success« The Hospital remained without wire gauze throughout the year* The suffering of the sick from flies was acute* Four fans were installed in four wards of the hospital and the dispensing floor was re—cemented• Supplies of drugs and dressings ftrora England through the Chief Medical Officer, Bahrain were satisfactory. (e). quarantine . The Quarantine Station at Haremal has had a complete overhaul • ▲ wall 6 feet high was built from the sea to the Mil behind completely shutting off the Quarantine Station from the village. The building for housing contacts had a new roof put on, walls repainted and unnecessary annexes done away with* ▲ platform was built on the sea side and the compound cleared of all rubble. There was no major epidemic during the year. On dhow with a Small Pox ease was isolated at Haremal, the patient treated in the Quarantine Hospital building. Measles, Mumps and Chicken Pox occurred during the year, but no serious outbreak* 2044 vaccinations were carried out and 1251 anti^Cholera Inoculations amongst passengers by ship and dhow. Vaccine lymph continues to come in sufficient quantities from Lahore* Other vaccines and Serums are received as required from the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Bahrain. 3* fqLmCJft SjTVATIQN. (a). Tribal . Early in the year Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamyar &amp;1 Ri&amp;mi bought a oar from Dubai and took it to Birkat el Moz* This was the first motor vehicle ever to reach Nezwa and Oman. The people who delivered the car to Shaikh Suleiman received permission to drive it through to Nezwa to show it to the Iowa. There was some anxiety as to the Imam's reactions, but contrary to expectations he at first showed no interest; he did, however, express his disgust with the drivers and ap passengers, who apparently smoked openly and did not conform with his ideas of good behaviour. Later he gave the oar his official blessing and took a ride in it himself but subsequently he reverted to his attitude of disapproval and in the end Shaikh Suleiman had to dispose of the oar. L Shaikh KhalldShaikh Khalid who succeeded as head of the Beni Bu Ali tribe, Ja f alan on the death of his father Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al Haaoodah al Alri was not accepted by the tribeanan as their chief; they appointed instead Salim bin Abdullah, brother of the late Shaikh* The Imam's daughter who married Shaikh Ahmad bin Handd died early in the year. The Sultan dismissed the Walls of Shinas, Sohar, Ihisaanna' and Khaaab. Sultan bin Salim the deposed Shaikh of Has al Khimah took refuge in Muscat in August after he had attacked the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent at Sharjah with a loaded rerolrer. The Sultan afforded him the proverbial •&lt; 'Arab Hospitality*, and off erred to mediate between the deposed Shaikh and His Majesty's Government. At the end of the year negotiations were still proceeding, with every prospect of success. The spasmodic raids on carnal caravans and buses plying between Muscat and Dubai and Sharjah occurred throughout the year* The Sultan was able to do little or nothing for their safeguard* Early in the year Shaikh Mohammed bin Nasir al fth'abl of the Abu Bagra arrived in Muscat to discuss the question of these raids with the Minister of the Interior but nothing came of these discussions and the raids continued. There has been throughout the year a general exodus of the Bedouin to the Oilfields of Bahrain, Qatar, Dhahran and Kuwait where they hope to obtain employment 0&gt;)* ItSSfil* Events in India and Pakistan were followed with much interest. The deaths of Mahatma Ghandi and Mohammed Ali Jinnah were deeply regretted, and marks of condolence were shown by all classes of the population* The Hyderabad 'incident' caused some feeling amongst both Indians and Pakistanis. On July IOth and Agreement was signed between His Highness and the Imperial Bank of Iran whereby a branch of the Imperial Batik of Iran was permitted to be opened in Muscat. The Bank started functioning on the 25th September and the fir#t Manager was Mr. D. Scott. The merchants had for long been clamouring for a bank and business so far has been fairly brisk. The birth of a son to Their Royal Highnesses Princess Elisabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh received with great rejoicing by all. The Consulate flagstaff was dressed and there was a round of parties where the healths of Their Royal Highnesses and the young Prince were freely drunk* His Highness 1 /congratulations were^ — ^ vn congratuLatione were sent to Their Majesties the King and Queen and to Their Royal Highnesses* In April the Sultan issued an 'Alan* 1 prohibiting the sale and import of liquor in his territory* As soon as it was known that Muscat was going 'dry' many of the local wine-bibbers began stocking their cellars with whatever they could lay their hands on at any price* His Highness unofficially permitted a reasonable quota to be Imported in the name of the Political Agent for the use of the Christian oomndnity* In November the Sultan stabilised the Caiza and fixed it at 100 balsas to the rupee* The balsa had been fluctuating rather alarmingly and had at one time reached the low level of 50 to the rupee* The minting of a large quantity of new balsas in various denominations was a blow to the merchants who had been hoarding the old ones* The stabilisation of the balsa had little effect on the cost of living, though the price of local foodstuffs, reckoned in rupees, fell slightly* On the 4th October His Highness decided to appoint Col* B* Woods-Ballard, C*I*E., M.B*E., as Minister for Foreign Affairs* This caused some dissatisfaction among certain State officials, who felt they would be deprived of much of their power* However, they had some respite for Col* Woods-Ballard was in England up to the end of the year* A British subject, named Hayatoon, whd is said to have committed some six or seven murders in Gwadur and Mekran was arrested at Gwadur and brought under escort to Muscat and is at present confined in Jalali prison. Difficulty has arisen over his trial for the Gwadur murders, partly on procedural grounds and partly because the witnesses from Gwadur are afraid to come and give evidence against him* It is hoped, however, to bring him to trial shortly* The following transfers among Walls occurred during the years Hilal bln Saud, Wall of Khasab appointed Wall of Gwadur* Hamood bin Ahmad was appointed Wall of Sohar in place of Saud bin Harlb but was later dismissed for embezzlement* Ibrahim bln Saud waa appointed as Wall of Khasab* Saiyid Majid bin Talmur formerly Wall of Birka was appointed as Wall of Muslnah* (c). Oil * Major RJI.R* Bird, formerly an I.P.S* officer but now working with Petroleum Concessions Limited as Liaison Officer, arrived in May with Shaikh Zald bin Sultan bln Zald to report to His Highness on his successful approach to the A1 Bu Shamis and the Bu Khureiban (Na»im) tribes. He had paid substantial sums of money* © of monoy to these two tribes for permission to explore parts of the interior for three years extendable for a further period of two years should the Company deem it necessary. The Sultan was much perturbed by the Company's direct negotiations and objected to the procedure partly fearing the loss of his prestige with the tribes, * though this in fact is small,and partly less the tribes should be encouraged to open their mouths too wide. However, the Sultan and Bird finally reached an agreement satisfactory to both parties which should facilitate future exploration in the interior. In short the Homan and the Cat hare come to an agreement; but the Man and the Dog have still to ratify it. It is reported that some of the Baraind tribes hare declared that they will not pay allegiance to the Sultan, as they feel that any agreement about oil in their territory should be with them and not with His Highness* Muscat is already being talked of as a 'boom town' should oil be discovered in commercial quantities and merchants have fantastic ideas of the fortunes they are likely to make. In early ’larch Petroleum Concessions Limited sent a Geologist party to Dhofar but the survey proved that there was little prospect of oil being found there. The Sultan was much depressed by Petroleum Concessions Limited's report and has asked that if the Company do not intend operating at Dhofar they should give up their option there and allow some other firm to take over the Concession* 4. mm- (a) . Statistics of imports and exports for the last two years are given in the appendix* Total imports for the year show a decrease of Rs,38,80,500 when compared with 1948/47, There was a decrease in imports from India of about 80Jt partly made tip by the increased imports from the Persian Gulf, China, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, Exports increased by Rs.14,00,600, Most of this increase was due to the enhanced export trade to India* The chief imports during the period under review were, cereals, coffee, ghee, sugar and textiles, while the main exports were, dates, limes and fish, (b) The exchange rate of the Maria Therese dollar has remained fairly low. It opened at PwS,225/~ to 100 M*T, dollars in January and dosed at Rs*I85/- to 100 M*T« dollars in December, The highest figure reached in the year was Rs,230/- to 100 M*T. dollars* The annual rise during the date season was very alight this year* Z (c).(o) • The import restrictions in India ehich were relaxed in did much to improve Muscat's date export business and the price of dates in general had substantially increased Iji 1948 as compared with 1947 when restrictions were in force in India* The export of dried fish as fish meal for manure to Ceylon and Holland showed a marked increase* 5 . smm- Mr* M*A* Rashid continued as Director General of Customs throughout the year. The airfields at Masirah and Salalah were in use throughout the year. The Sultan agreed to the use of Masirah and Salalah airfields by French Military Aircraft for a period of three months, but insisted that there should be a formal agreement if they intended to continue using the airfields for a further period. Qantas Airways had applied for a renewal of their authorization to fly over Muscat territory and land there if necessary. His Highness is agreeable to its renewal subject to an authorization fee of L.5/' per aircraft per annum* 7. IREMGR INTERESTS . The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year* Their b uilding i is now being occupied by the Imperial Bank of Iran. 8. AMERICAN INTERESTS . The U.3.S.'Greenwich Bay* with Captain W.S. Butt in command called at Muscat on the I9th July and left on the 23rd* Little or no enthusiasm was shown locally and the State authorities showed great reluctance to entertain the men of the warship. His Highness had to be persuaded to receive a call by the American Captain. 9. P3S10. N WQffi . The American Mission (Dutch Reformed Church) was served by Rev. J.R. Kapenga and Dr. Huesinkveld who replaced Rev. Dykestra and Dr. W. Thoms. The good work done by the Mission does not appear to be appreciated by the Government who dosed their school in 1947 and will not allow it to be reopened. Dr. and Mrs. Huesinkveld, who had arrived from Kuwait with Muscat visas granted by the Pditltal Agent, Kuwait had some difficulty in landing and were very nearly sent back; but the Political Agent was able to smooth over the misunderstanding ^10. SlaverySLAVERY 14 Blares applied far and received Manumission Certificates during the period under review. All the applicants had applied for nanumiaslon on the grounds of ill treatment by their masters. 11. Communlat Activities. There is practically nothing to report* A school teacher in Gwadur said to have Communist sympathies was dismissed* 12. WEATHER . Muscat experienced a severe gale on July 7th, which not only caused a great deal of damage to sailing craft, cargo and houses but was also the cause of loss of life* The summer of 1943 will go down in the annuals as the worst for sa many a year. The hottest month was May when the maximum temperature was III 0 on the 24th, the coldest month being January when the temperature dropped to 62° • Highest humidity was lOOJt in the months of July and August* Muscat had a little over 5' of rain during the year. PART II I. RULING FaiOLY . (a) . Hla Hlehmsa Salyjd Said bln Talaur. Hia Highness returned to Muscat from Dhofar on March 8th and remained in the Capital for the rest of the year. While in Dhofar he discovered deposits of iron ore with a 94$ content of iron. He sent a sample of the ore for analysis to Sir Cyril Fox who stated that the ore was of very good quality but that there should be at least one million tons of it before it could be comnerclally exploited. The Sultan maintained good health throughout the year. His dealings with the Political Agent have at all times been most cordial and friendly. (b) . Sajyjd Shlhab bln Faisal . Unde Of His Highness, Visited Bombay in the second week of December and was still away at the end of the year. His visit is believed to have been primarily to discuss State affairs with the ex-Sultan. (o) Sbiyid Taimur bln Faisal * The ex-Sultan remained in India throughout the year. Was to have visited Dhofhr but the visit did not materialise. (d) flalvid Ahmed bln Ibrahim. He remained Minister of the Interior during 1943. He left Muscat for Sohar early in June with the object of opening the Wadi Jiszi to motor transport. He returned to Muscat with great poop and show, having*: an escort of over 300 camels. One result of his visit to Sohar was the dismissal of the Wall of Sohar for embezzlement•(•) aalyid Tario bin Taliaur . Held the poet of President of the ttndolpal Council throughout the year. He Tisited Indie in June end returned in the first week of August. He is very popular both with the Arabs and foreigners. (f). Saivid flahr bln Taimur. Brother of the Sultan. Is now completing e course at the Infantry School in Karachi after which he will be attached to an Infantry unit in Pakistan. 2 . mmr&amp;mms* Saiyid Tariq bin Talmur , President of tbs Municipality did his utmost . with what little resources were at his disposal to improving the cleanliness of the public thoroughfares. The Municipality carried out the following important work during the years 1. Enlargement of the road from Muscat f Agabh to Mnttrmh. 2. Removal of dung heaps. 3. Spraying of D.D.T. to exterminate flies and moequitoes. 3. HBBIXBM* Under the Headmaster, a Palestinian named Ghalib Naqshbandi and two new Palestinian teachers, Dais Shabbuddin and Akil Dujani, the standard of education has been raieed considerably. The two young Palestinians have modern ideas and their attempts to study local conditions with a view to improving them has met with strong resistance. Dujani attempted to introduce Physiology into his classes but was told that the Sultan objected to it and he had to stop. It appears that the Sultan is somewhat doubtful of the advantages of improved education at present, possibly from the fear of rousing religious prejudices. The Girls 9 school under the supervision of Mistress Mtudrah is rapidly improving. 4. flHMIk During the year 1948 direct cable consnunication was maintained with Kara(dil and Aden, except for a temporary interruption to the Karachi cable due to storm damage on June 7th. The system has been greatly strengthened by the renewel of Shore-ends for both the Karachi and Aden cables by C.S. 'Retriever 9 early in October, replacing emergency Shore-ends laid in during the late war. During 1949 it le expected to make the Aden/Musoat/fcaraohl chain fully autonatic. Under the new system efficiency will be much improved, delays reduced still further end line errors reduced to a mlnlnam. Communication with Bahrain and Kuwait is, at present, by cable to Aden and thence by wireless. It is hoped that the cable between Muscat and Bahrain will be repaired shortly and a new Shore-end laid in at Muscat. / Armcratufl and2 Appemtuu and stores far a new telephone system for Muscat and Muttrah haws been arriving steadily and it is hoped to make a start on the Installation within the next six months. For the first time Cable and ttlreless, Muscat have recruited two young Muscat is for training as operators • This appears to be a part of a new scheme to handle traffic in Arabic. The two boys were sent for training to Cable ft Wireless headquarters at Karachi• Tha Post Office which had formerly been under the Government &lt;f Pakistan waa taken over on April 1st by the British Poet Office under a British Postal Superintendent with his headquarters at Bahrain. 5 . niMm. 22 ships (wail) called at Muscat from India and 25 from the Gulf during the year. Besides the above 23 others both British and Foreign called here either on their way to or from the Gulf. 6. POLICE . Subedar Karla Dad 9 resident of Gwadur was incharge of the Police Force* Ke replaced Subedar Ffcqir Mohammed who had retired and returned to Gwadur. ?. naag* Major T.P. Greenwood held the post of Commandant of the Muscat Levies throughout the year. Ifcjor Greenwood reports that with Increased nambers and a higher standard of education among the N.C.Os the Muscat Levies could be comparable to any equivalent Indian Amy Unit, as the men are of good material and stout heart. n-.t p,.-. ^ 3 local Officers. The total strength of the force stands at 305 other ranks. 8. ROYAL rUVY . The following Naval vessels visited Muscat during 1948. H.N.S. •Loch Glendhu'from February 4th to 6th. H.M.S. •Wren 1 from February 9th to I4th. H.M.S. 'Loch Glendhu 1 March 2nd to 3rd, 6th to 8th, 13th to I6th and from 26th to 2Sth.

(n) rmATtm 1. mum nmn .. Mr* Rashid Ahmed. 2. THE WALI . Saiyid Hllal bln Saud. When Ismail &amp;r Rassasi, the Mali of Muttrah visited Oeadur cm behalf of the Sultan representations were made to him by the people of Gwadur for a more experienced Mali* Hilal bin Saud, is in fact, not up to the Job, but nothing has yet been done. 3. APmiSTRATOR. Mr. ABDUR lahman remained as Administrator throu^iout the year. He was summoned to ^luscat by the Sultan in April and after a two weeks stay returned to Gwadur. The Sultan is appointing a British Administrator for Gwadur in the near future. 4* TRADE . The figures of imports and exports are included in those for Muscat. Gwadur f s export fish trade remained reasonably good. Large quantities oi fish were exported to Karachi and Colombo at a good price. Prices of sugar varied and at one time mis being sold at the good price of Rs.7/- per maund of about lo lbs. The lowest price ves Rs.4/9/- per maund. The price of rice which is inaiAly smuggled in from Pakistan was sold at between R*.IOO/~ and Rs.170/- per bag. There is considerable smuggling of cotton piece goods from Gwadur to Pakistan where they fetch very good prices. 5. m ni fc. In February a clash between the Zikris and the Mussulmans of Dori-rek over a question of sacrifice sms narrowly avoided/ by the intervention of the Wall and the British Agent. Attempts to find a doctor for Gwadur are still without success* There were four cases of Small Pox, two of which were fatal. Dr. Mot ala, the Assistant Agency Surgeon, was sent to Gwadur to deal with the oases and to vaccinate the population. Pakistan currency mis in circulation in Gwadur for a while but the Sultan made the Indian rupee the only legal tender. With Gwadur and Pakistan so closely linked economically it is difficult to see how this arrangement can work for very long. Total prohibition was enforced in May.XI In December a Company calling itself ’’The Muslim Navigation Company of Karachi” inaugurated a motor passenger and cargo service to Gvadur via Pasni. The introduction of this service has been sell received by the people of Gvadur as it is a fast and frequent service and its rates are less than those of the whose slow mail service is not able to deal with all the passenger traffic to Karachi* 6. Mg AND The Gwadur Post Office continued to function most inefficiently under the Pakistan administration. It is in fact chiefly a telegraph office, but the Gwadur - Pasni telegraph line was continuously interrupted throughout the year. It sadly needs replacement; so does the Postmaster. 7. CQi.LfJNICATICNS . ▲bout 25 B.I* alow mail steamers called at Gwadur in either direction. 8. Am-LCCUST OPERATIONS. In July a large area in Bekr&amp;n and Gwadur was effected by locust breeding.
