Mr. T&amp;wzi Khaddurah the resident engineer at Ahmedi of the Contracting and Trading Company called this morning and wished to Know whether his company could register^ preferably in Kuwait or failing that in Bahrain^ seven aircraft belonging to them. If the answer is in the affirmative he wishes to Know what formalities are to be complied with. 2* Details of the aircraft are enclosed ( in original ). I understand they are all flown by British pilots. The Company wish to use them in the Persian Gulf States, Muscat, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, but not in Persia. 3.

Sir Hupert Kay, KCIE., CSI., Political Hesident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.(26/101/49) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY 21st May, 1949. BAHRAIN. COS FI}' F Please refer to your letter C/109 of the 7th May about the application of Mr. Fawzi Khaddurah to register seven aircraft belonging to the Contracting and Trading Company. 2. I have discussed this request with Barnard and we neither of us understand what is behind it. There seems to be no necessity at present to make special arrangements for the registration of aircraft at either Kuwait or Bahrain and valid registration elsewhere can be accepted. It is, of course, necessary that the provisions of the Kuwait Air j Navigation Regulations especially para 3 should be complied/ with. 3. So far as I am aware, provided the aircraft comply with the Air Navigation Regulations in force in the various Persian Gulf States, there is no objection to the company using them for charter flights in the manner proposed. So far as Muscat is concerned, hov/ever, I should wish to consult the Muscat Government about the scheme generally and it would be necessary to make sure that only such aircraft are used for visits to Muscat as can land and take off there safely. To begin with, in any case, it would I think be necessary to give the Political Agent, Muscat prior notice of each intended flight and ascertain from him that there was no objection to it. 4. I am sending copies of this letter and of your letter under reply to the Foreign Office, Barnard, and the Political Agents at Bahrain and Muscat. G.N.

It appears that the Contracting and Trading Company wish to register the aircraft outside the Lebanon; and that they will probably now register them in the United Kingdom. /•'V I H.E.

I have to refer to your calls on rne on the 7th May, 1949 and the 19th June about the registration of seven aircraft belonging to your Company and to say that it is not at present considered necessary to make special arrangements for the registration of aircraft at either Kuwait or Bahrain, and that valid registration elsewhere will be accepted. 2. It is necessary of course that the provisions of the Kuwait Air Navigation Regulations should be complied with. 3. There is no objection to your Company using the aircraft in the Persian Gulf States, but it will be necessary to give the British Political Agent at Muscat prior notice of each intended flight to Muscat and to ascertain from him that there is no objection to it.
