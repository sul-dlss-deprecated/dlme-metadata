A w a 1 ^: February 6th, 1939. A JSB:CDS,c ' A D.O. ^o.39. The Residency, Bushire, tne 13tn Jan'oary 1939 • © A question in connection witn the Indian labour recruited locally in Bahrain by tne Bahrain Petroleum Company has arisen %hich can be summarised as follows; 2. Tne Bahrain Petroleum Company employ two kinds of Indian labour (a) recruited in India (b) recruited locally in Bahrain. 3. With regard to (a). after considerable correspondence between the Company and the Protector of ^migrants, Bombay, toowhich we gsYe our good offices in the way of assistance, the Company agreed to the form of contract approved of by the Protector of .^migrants, and this class of laoour is now being recruited Dy tne Company in the ordinary way. 4. In regard to (b). It has always been ir\y opinion that contracts for this class of labour should also be drawn up between tne Company and tneir employees mutatis mutandis on the lines of tnos e for class (a). For instance, while for class ^a) there is a clause tna t tne Company should pay the employee's v ^ay oa ck . to India at tne conclusion of his employment and in certain other circumstances, there would not appear to be any grounds for inserting a similar clause in the contracts for class (b). The Company were quite willing to do this, and in fact early last year agreed to put the 319 locally recruited Indians under agreements approved of by the Protector of 3mi grants and to register them as such, but wished Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, K.C.I.J. , G.S.I., M.V.O., Secretary to tne Government of India in tne External Affairs Department, Hew Delni. /to— (S to do so in Karacm in&amp;tead of Bomoay . Tne Company objected to tnis and there ensued consider a Die fur tne r correspondence beUeen the Company and the Protector of immigrants. There may be some technical difficulties as to why the Indians in question should not have been registered at Karachi but if the Protector of Emigrants had seen his way to agree to this it seems to me that the locally employed Indians would by now have been in pos session of proper contracts. Unfortunately as a result of the further correspondence oet^een the Company and the protector of nimigrants the Company have now raised the question of his Juris diction. In a letter to the Political Agent, Bahrain, they say: •♦The points we would very much like to nave cleared up are: U) Whether the Government of Bombay and/or the Protector of Emigrants, Bombay, have any Jurisdiction over the type of contract that is used to hire Indians in other countries. ^b) Whether the GovernirEnt of Bombay has any authority to order Companies woricing in other countries to adopt a certain form of contract for hiring Indians locally who when in India do not reside within the Jurisdic tion of the Bombay Government. In this connection we should mention that of the 103 Class HA. and IIB employees who are not on contract, 33 reacn their nomes through Bombay and 70 tnrougn Karacni.' 1 5 # as I understand it, the Company have no objection to my, or the Political Agent's, jurisdiction, i.e., the authorities on the spot who are well acquainted with local conditions, but they are somewhat apprehensive of Jurisdiction from outside i.e. Bombay# 6. In regard to the question of Jurisdiction. Bahrain is a foreign state in special treaty relations witu His Majesty's Government and the only autnorities who can exercise Jurisdiction there by virtue of the Order in Council are the Political Agentand the Political Resident. Neither the Bombay Government nor the Protector of Smigrants have any juridical standing in Bahrain whatever in regard to Indian labour employed by the Go mpa ny. jurisdiction, from tne pra cti ca 1 point of view, what has to be done nov^ is to gat the contracts between the Company and their locally recruited Indian employees made up without further delay. To effect this I vsould propose informing the Company to the fol lowing effect: that tne authorities who can exercise jurisdic tion are the Political Agent and myself, and that they should draw up contracts with tneir locally recruited Indian employees as already agreed upon with the Protector of Emigrants. I would further inform the Protector of immigrants of my communication to the Company, and explain that these contracts would be enforceable in law in the court of the Political Agent, and that therefore tne interests of tne employees in question would be fully protected firm iry view as to jurisdiction contained in paragraph 6 above, and approve of the action proposed in imirediately preceding paragraph. 7. On the assumption that 1 am correct on tnis point of 8. I would be grateful if tne Government of India would con- 9. I should oe grateful for a reply as soon as possible# I am sending a copy of this letter to Weightman. (Sd. ) T.C. FOWLSGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN | NOTICE. Ho. 2/1558.

The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, Reference jrour recent telephone conversation, I i enclose herewith one copy of the draft agreement for locally engaged Indian personnel. Yours faithfully. I Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain. v1632-28/14. Political Agency, (g) Bahrain, the 29th August 1939. To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, I have the following observations to make on the draft form of agreement for locally employed British Indian subjects, forwarded with your letter No. PA-387 dated the 26th July 1939: (a) Article I and elaevihere In the draft. Since the persons for whom the agreement is intended will be recruited in Bahrain for service in Bahrain I suggest tl»t the word 'Bahrain' be substituted for the words 'zone of operations' 1 . (b) AryLclfiJZ (1) If the amendment suggested in (a) is accepted by the Company, the first six words of this article should be deleted. (ii) This article refers to certain health regulations. I should of course require a copy of any such regulations before approving of the form of agreement or before counter signing any agreement between the Company and an employee. (c) Art Ac i; I must also know the provisions of the Company's 'regulations or instructions' the non-compliance with which would be a cause for summary dismissal# In this article the words 'or an allowance' presumably mean an allowance for food. If this is so, it should be clearly stated. (d)/(i)/ It is noted that this article makes it clear that if an employee terminates the agreement before the completion of 12 months then Article 13 (c) shall apply. What will be the position if his agreement is for 3 years and he terminates it on one month's notice after, say, 18 months of service? There seems to be no provision for this. (•) ArttaiU 19 . (i) I think the wording of the first sub-paragraph should be changed. It apparently qualifies sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) and if so, should come below them. It apparently means that if the employee wishes to use the free transportat ion offered by tho Company and to have any vacation to which he may be entitled he must leave Bahrain by the boat on which the Company book a passage for him. If this is so, the meaning should be made clear. (ii) The meaning of the words '(without any vacation or allowance therefore)' occurring at the end of sub-paragraph (b) cannot be understood. (iii) Since the agreement refers to employees locally recruited in Bahrain there does not appear to be any need to refer in sub-paragraph (c) to the employees paying expenses of his passage and the words 'shall pay all expenses of his passage' occurring in this sub-paragraph can be omitted. (f) Article 14 I should require a copy of the regulations and instructions issued by the Company before approving of any agreement referring to these. (g) Ar^igl^ V? Since this is an agreement made in Bahrain for service in Bahrain the word 'foreign' should be omitted. (h) ArttalS 1% It is in conflict with Article 13 and can be omitted.O r. tf ** C j ** ♦ * v (i) Article 19 As this agreement is for men recruited in Bahrain, an employee may have his family in Bahrain before he enters the service of the Company. I do not think therefore that this article can stand. (j) f*? If Bahrain is substituted for 'zone of operations', this definition \yill become unnecessary. (k) Article 21 I suggest that the words 'British Government Officer' exercising judicial powers in Bahrain' 1 be substituted by 'Political Agent, Bahrain'. 3* I agree to countersigning agreements made between the / \ Company and the locally recruited Indians, once the form of agreement is accepted. : u Yours faithfully, I Political Agentf Bahrain. \3 * ^ ^&gt; c c Li® THE BAHREIN UM COMPANY LIMITED Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf.

NOTES ON BAHREIN m - Bahrein is a group of Islands situated in the Persian Gulf in Longtitude 50 SS' East and Latitude 26 North. They are just North of the Tropic fef Cancer and so cannot be referred to as being w in the Tropics*. The climate in the summer, however, can be very hot, temperatures of 118° F. in the shade being recorded with at times very hi^i relative humidities. This hot weather lasts from July to October inclusive, the rest of the year being mild, becoming at times cold during February and yarch with temperatures as low as♦o 0 ?. »i (g) With suoh a temperature range It can be readily unde stood that both light and heavy clothing Is required. There Is a good bazaar Is Manama where almost all articles of clothing can be obtained, shirts, underwear, etc., ready made, and suits, trousers, shorts, etc., ordered to be made by one of the numerous Indian tailors. Bahrein Island, the largest of the Group, Is about 28 miles long and 8 to 10 miles wide at Its widest part, the longer axis lying approximately N. and S. The Company^s main offices are situated at Awall, 13 miles from Manama, the Capital, near the centre of the Island and the Company's Refinery about 11^ miles by road from Manama but on the E. coast of the Island, some miles from Awall. A sketch map on the following page shows the situation of the Company^ centres of activity. Apart from a stretch of some twenty miles bordering the * orth coast of the Island to a depth of from one to three miles the Island Is barren desert. In the cultivated strip large quantities of dates and some other vegetables and fruits are grown, water being furnished by Irrigation ditches fed from artesian wells. Until the discovery of oil by this Company In 1931 Bahrein lived largely on Its own resources of dates and fish.

'01* employees are furnished with a housing allowance of Rs. 35. 0. 0 per month and find their own accommodation in Manama. There are one or two exceptions to this where the individual concerned has a room and essential furniture furnished in Awali and does not receive allowance. Transportation to and from Awali is provided by the Company. 'A' Employees are furnished with single accommoda tion by the Company, but if family here with Company consent receive a Rs. 20# 0. 0 per month housing allowance, most of them living in the Raffa area. Transportation is not provided for them. 'D' Hiese employees live in Company quarters at Awali only one or two wanting their wives here, in which case if request is granted they receive housing allowance as for employees. (b) MSDICAL FACILITISS* The Company maintains Dispensaries and first Aid stations at Awali and Refinery for treatments not requiring the patient to be sent to hospital. Those who require hospital treatment are looked after by the Mission Hospital in Man aire at Company expense. Medical treatment is also given free to their families by Mission Hospital provided such treatment is such as would be given by an ordinary General Practitioner, this excludes confinements and dental treatment.

'CT' employees in general belong to the Bahrein Sports Club which on request would be helped by the Company to maintain its recreational facilities etc. Hiere is an offer still open to them of up to Rs* 1500. 0. 0 towards their new club house if they can raise money elsewhere as well, as membership is not exclusively made up of Bapco employees. This club has all necessary recreational facilities available, 'A 1 * employees have been provided with a club building at Raffa, Hockey and Football grounds and will from time to time receive assistance from the Company towards further recreational facilities, library etc. Uiis group includes some Iraqis. 'D' employees (mostly Goanese) have no specific recreational facilities provided nor have they requested any. We trust that the foregoing information will be sufficient for your purpose.

Will you pleftse refer to your demi-official letter No*518 dated the 19th April 1940 on the subject of the relations existing between the Bahrain Petroleum Goiapany and their Indian employees? ' .0 * ^ 2, Yeu will see from the correspondence ending vyith my demi-official letter No.C/718-10/l-G dated the S2nd November 1938 that airrenfrenents vere made in September of that, year that the Company should circularise all Indian employees in acccrdanci with instructions contained in paragraph 3 ,of Sir Trenchard Fowled demi-official letter No.aGC-S da^ed the 10th June 1938. In addition, Kowes, who was acting Political Agent, informed some 12 representatives of the Indian employees at a meeting held in September 1938 that the Political Agent was always prepared to examine any cases in which there were genuine grounds for dissatisfaction. It was stressed however that all complaints should in the first instance be lodged with the Personnel Manager, the Political Agent then being approached if any employee had special reasons for feeling still, aggrieved after his complaint had been dealt with by the Personnel Manager. 3 # Since then I 5iave received ro serious complaints of unfair treatment of Indian employees by the Company, and practically all the complaints which have been ledged at ohe Agency have been in connection with their final settlement after men have completed their contracts. In almosx, all these cases it was found that the Company had dealt fairly with the employees/ Captain A. C.

The quarters for '•A* 1 and 11 D M class employees which were constructed some two years ago, are I consider very satisfactory. 6# As regards medical facilities, dispensaries and first aid stations are maintained at Awali and the Refinery for cases which do not require hospital treatment. By an arrangement of which I have approved the fliasion Hospital in Manama takes in all Indian employees requiring hospital treatment at the Company's expense. Medical treatment is also given free to families by the Mission Hospital, provided that the treatment is such as would be given by an ordinary medical practitioner (i.e. excluding things such as confinements or dental treat ment). 6. As far as recreation is concerned most of the 11 CT 11 employees belong to the Bahrain Sports Club in l/anama, (of which I myself am a member). The Company has offered this Club a sum of Bs.1600/- for the construction of a new club house if members are able to rc-ise the 7 -est of the money elsewhere.••A' employoefl have been provided with a club building and hockey and focthall groundc and the Company have expressed their willingness to improve the recreation«I facilities for this class of employees• 7.

Bahrein is a group of Islands situated in the Persian Gulf in Longitude 50 55' East and Latitude 26 North. They are thus )ust north of the Tropic of Cancer and so cannot be referred to as being ' in the Tropics.' The climate in the summer, however, can be very hot, temperatures of 118° F. in the shade being recorded with at times very high relative humidities. This hot weather lasts from July to October inclusive, the rest of the year being mild, becoming at times cold during February and March with temperatures as low as 4U t. During the summer all sleeping quarters are air cooled enabling good rest to be taken even on the hottest days. With such a temperature range it can be readily understood that both light and heavy clothing is required. There is a good bazaar in Manama where almost all articles of clothing can be obtained, shirts, underwear, etc., ready made, and suits, trousers, shorts, etc., ordered to be made by one of the numerous Indian tailors. It is advisable however, to bring your dinner jackets (tuxedos) from home and dress shoes, though fair quality shoes can now be purchased locally. A sufficient supply of work cbthes tor immediate needs till there is time to shop for more should also be brought.The following sports are played in Bahrein and necessary equipment may be bought through the Club, if not brought from home. Golf Tennis Association Football Squash Table Tennis Hockey Badminton Cricket There is also a large swimming pool for use during the Summer months, and sea bathing, fishing and yachting can be indulged in. Motion pictures are shown and occasional variety and other entertainments staged at the air cooled Auditorium provided by the Company at Awali. Bahrein Island, the largest of the Group, is about 28 miles long and 8 to 10 miles wide at its widest part, die longer axis being approxi mately N. and S. It is on this Island that the Company's activities are centred, Awali, the main Company settlement being situated 13 miles from Manama (the Capital) near the centre of the Island. Apart from a stretch of some twenty miles bordering the North coast of the Island to a depth of from one to three miles the Island is barren desert. In the cultivated strip large quantities of dates and some other vegetables and fruits are grown, water being furnished by irrigation ditches fed from artesian wells. Until the discovery of Oil by this Company in 1931 Bahrein lived largely on its own resources of dates and fish, its only other industry being pearl-diving which industry is still carried on, though not so flourishing now as before the advent of the cultured pearls so much in vogue at present. The Bahreini inhabitants are very largely of Arab descent, but there is a large number of Iranians (formerly Persians) and a lesser number of such varied nationalities as Baluchis, Iraqis, British Indians, Somalis, etc. The Island forms part of the Mohammedan Sheikhdom of Bahrein which is in treaty relationship with and protected by Great Britain through the Indian Government, the Island being used as a base for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force operating in the area and as a stopping place by Imperial Airways on the Indian and Aus tralian routes.There are five services of Imperial Airways weekly in each direction so letter mails are frequent. Parcels which are not too bulky and papers can be sent via Overland from England, larger parcels going by P. &amp; O. Line via Bombay. United States letter mails marked for ' Air Mail ' come across the Atlantic by boat or Air and on from Southampton by Imperial Airways, United States parcel and paper mail coming by direct steamer from New York or via the Pacific and Bombay. The Company maintains its own Post Office in Awali for the convenience of Employees both for the distribution and dispatch of mail. Bahrein has good cable and wireless communications with other parts of the World. Rates are rather high but personal messages to Bahrein may be sent using the Company's registered cable address ' BAPCO, BAHREIN,' preceded by the addressee's surname. The postal address is Awali, Bahrein Islands, Persian Gulf. preceded by the box number in cases where a Mail Box is allotted to the Employee. The maps on the following pages show the situation of Bahrein and give some idea of the various travel routes to and from the United Kingdom and the U.S.A., as well as showing the situation of Awali, etc. in relation to the rest of the Island. All Employees coming to Bahrein must be vaccinated against Smallpox and inoculated against the A. &amp; B. groups of typhoid in fection before departure from home and must carry their vaccination and inoculation Certificates with them. On arrival in Bahrein they will be required to undergo a further single typhoid injection as a precaution against a group of infection recently recognised as existent in the East in general. Personal property of all persons is subject to Customs examina tion and possible payment of duties at Bahrein. Customs charges are usually levied only on new articles and are not excessive. Customs duty is in all cases for Employee's personal account.U.S. TO BAHREIN VIA JAPAN, CMINA.

SAFETY All employees are expected to conform with safe practice both on and off the job. Remem ber that a large number of our employees are not as yet safety minded, and Staff Employees should see that others are properly safeguarded at the work they are doing. Attendance at Safety and First Aid lectures will be obligatory, and you should realize that your attendance tends not only to your own safety but to that of others, whilst the attendance of others may lead to your receiving proper attention at once should the need ever arise. Company Safe Practice Regulations in Book let form will be issued to all employees on arrival in the Zone of Operations. FIRE All employees should carefully familiarise ORGANIZATION themselves with the instructions set forth in the Fire Organization Charts that are posted in various positions in Awali and at the Refinery. FIREARMS The importation or possession of firearms is strictly prohibited in Bahrein and employees are warned that bringing these in or attempting to do so may have serious consequences to themselves. AUTOMOTIVE Drivers have been placed on all Company EQUIPMENT cars and trucks and except in emergency or special cases, equipment should be driven only by these men. Any one not holding a Bahrein Government Driving Licence may not drive a car anywhere on the Island. Employees wishing to procure a Bahrein Driver's Licence can apply to the Personnel Department for the requisite form which when filled in and signed by the applicant is to be taken to the Garage Foreman who will give a test. The form is then returned to the Personnel Department who will apply for the licence.2 The cost of the licence is charged to employ ees personal account unless advice to the contrary is received from the Head of Department in which employee works. Owners of private cars are obliged to register them with the Government. Information as to the cost of registration, etc. can be obtained from the Personnel Department. The Personnel Department will undertake the obtaining of licences for employees private cars, the cost being charged to the employee's personal account. Private car owners should note that insurance against third party risks as well as against loss, damage, etc. is ad visable. Any car insurance required should be taken out by the individual concerned as Company insurance does not extend to cover private vehicles, the property of employees. Government speed limits are in force and are to be strictly observed as are any Regulations issued by the Government from time to time. There is for instance now a traffic circus by the Customs House. Company cars will not be furnished for personal use.

Current rates for these taxis will be posted on bulletin boards from time to time. Transportation between points inside fence at Awali is available at a small charge by calling Transportation Office.

All vehicles must keep to the left of the road. 2. It is forbidden to drive a car without a Bahrein Driving licence. 3. Police in uniform may stop cars at any time and inspect for conformity to Regulations and also inspect Driving Licenses.3 ALLOTMENTS, Accounts may be opened at the Manama i BANK ACCOUNTS, Branch of The Eastern Bank Ltd. No interest ETC. is paid but there are no charges or minimum deposit requirements. Withdrawals may be made by cheque or chit to the Bank Manager. Specimen Signature Cards and forms for application for opening an account can be obtained from the Cashier. Balance of Salaries and Field Allotments can be paid direct to Bank Accounts if desired. Both British and American employees can make home allotments from their salaries which are handled as follows :— American Employees. Required disposition of salary is authorised to the Company on Form Pro. 167-F and Home Allotments are paid from the New York Office on the first of every month from a list mailed from Bahrein on approximately the 15th of the previous month. No changes in allotment can be made after the 15th of the month in which the change is to take effect. British Employees. Home Allotments are paid through the Com pany's London Agents, Messrs. The California Standard Oil Company Ltd. on or about the 5th of every month. No changes can be made after the 20th of the month in which the change is to take effect.

Similarly those who are going on leave are expected to change their Home Allotments as necessary to allow them sufficient funds in Bahrein to take care of their requirements at the time of going on leave. Agents of the Company and Travel Agents through whom passages for employees may be booked have instructions not to make advances to any employee of the Company. LIQUOR It is only by reason of a special privilege extended to the Company by His Highness The Sheikh of Bahrein that the sale of liquor is permitted in the Club and employees must realize the importance of proper control of liquor in a Mohammedan Sheikhdom. It is of the utmost importance that liquor does not get into the hands of those who are not supposed to have it. Abuse of the use of liquor and the allowing of it to reach unauthorised persons might very probably result in the loss of the special privilege which has been extended to us by His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein.4 CLUB For reasons detailed in the preceding para graph it is necessary for the Management to have the final word in all matters pertaining to the Club. At present all employees of the Company are ipso facto members of the Bapco Club, no entrance fee or subscription being charged, but it is possible that at some later date, entrance fees and/or subscription will be reimposed. A House Committee with advisory powers has been set up who will handle any case of misconduct and who are also empowered to make recommendations to the Management with regard to such matters as hours of opening and closing, etc. Members causing wilful damage to furniture, fixtures or fittings may be charged for the damage as assessed by the House Committee. Purchases can only be made by coupon with the exception of purchases for large amounts (not including rounds of drinks) which can be signed for on one of the Club Chits provided. Coupon Books value Rs. 10/- each are obtainable in the Club and are signed for on the front page which is returned to the vendor, passed to the Cashier and the value taken off the employees salary at the end of the month. Bar hours will be in accordance with Notices posted from time to time. A special room has been provided in the Club for use of employees in dirty and working clothes and they are requested not to enter other parts of the Club on account of damage to Club property that might result. Periodicals and newspapers are not to be removed from the Club House. Remember other members will want to see them. The Club maintains a good reading and reference library which is set up on much the same lines as lending libraries elsewhere though no charge is made for borrowing books. Fines may be imposed by the Library Committee in cases where volumes are retained longer than a specified period. Regulations will be made by the Committees concerned from time to time regulating the use of games facilities, which should be strictly adhered to by members for the sake of all.5 PUBLICATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHY The publication of articles and photographs Vft dealing with Bahrein is prohibited without ^ - special permission from the Bahrein Govern ment. The taking of photographs in the Naval Base at Jufair is strictly prohibited and employees are warned accordingly. No photographs may be taken during the Muharram religious ceremonies (See Holidays). HOURS OF WORK Friday is the regular off day for day workers but special arrangements are in force for shift men to work a six day week only, having their day off on a special department schedule. Hours of work do not regularly exceed eight per day except in emergency and will be as posted from time to time by notice. CONDUCT All employees are to conduct themselves in such a manner both on and off the job, that they will bring no discredit upon themselves or the Company. Drunkenness, fighting or misconduct of any kind will not be tolerated, neither will absence from work without authority. Any one of the abuses referred to will be considered as cause for dismissal from the Company's service as referred to in employee's Foreign Service Agreement. Staff Employees may not accept presents in any form from Employees in other categories. No smoking in the Refinery during working hours will he permitted except in the Main Office, Construction Office, Yard Superintendent's Office and the Timekeeping Office at the Main Gate. Smoking will be permitted during the lunch period in the Shop Area and in the Lunch Room. Local Government Regulations do not permit of any one boarding B. &amp; I. steamers when in port except for the purpose of leaving Bahrein or on duty. Passports in order for leaving are sufficient to allow of the former boarding, but those going on board on duty require a letter from the Personnel Department to the Passport Officer before they can obtain permission.6 HEALTH In the Persian Gulf the sun is dangerous. Those exposed to it should wear topees at all times from March to November. Sudden changes in weather during seasonal changes cause colds which are difficult to shake off. It is advisable to carry a coat or sweater in the mornings and evenings. Drinking during working hours is strictly prohibited. In this connection during the hot weather it is actually dangerous to drink during the heat ot the day, especially if one is exposed to the heat of the sun shortly afterwards. Drinking during the noon hours is discouraged especially during the hot season. Drinking unboiled water and eating uncooked food outside of Awali and the Refinery should be avoided, as such practice is very dangerous. There is a certain amount of Malaria in Bahrein and anyone feeling ill should report to the Doctor. ON NO ACCOUNT SHOULD QUININE BE TAKEN WITHOUT DOCTOR'S ORDERS as this may render it practically impossible for him to make a diagnosis. During the hot weather replacement of body salts lost by perspiration is important and salt tablets are provided. Taking 2 to 6 of these daily replaces the loss and renders you less liable to heatstroke. Ice cold drinks and drinking too quickly may cause stomach cramps as may also too much undiluted fruit juice. So drink slowly, dilute fruit juice well and let the iciness of a drink wear off slightly before taking it. The proportion of meat in the diet should be reduced in the summer and more vegetables than usual eaten. HOSPITAL The Hospital is situated in the Lower Camp Area and employees are informed that the regular hours for attendance are as follows :— 9.00 A.M. to 12 NOON. 4.00 P.M. to 6.00 P.M. EMERGENCIES WILL BE TREATED AS SUCH. Attendance on the off day should be avoided if possible as the Doctors require a rest as much as anyone else. See also Chapter dealing with Medical Treatment.7 HOUSING Houses and Rooms are allotted by the Agp) Personnel Department through the Housing C Supervisor and employees are not to move from the place allotted unless asked to do so or unless permission has been obtained. Only by close observation of this rule can employees be traced when required for delivery of telegrams, for duty, etc. Similarly furniture is not to be removed from any of the living quarters except with the permission of the Housing Supervisor who has to carry an inventory showing where all the furniture under his charge is in use. Gas fires should not be left burning after retiring. This is very important as there is a great danger of gas poisoning, asphyxiation or explosion, should the fire be blown out during a ' Shamal ' leaving the gas to escape unburnt. Lights, fans, and A.C. Units should be turned off when not in use as the Power System is frequently overloaded. Employees are not to tamper with the air conditioning plant, lines or units, any failure being reported to the office of Maintenance No. 2 District. Tampering with the cooling lay out in any way may have ill effects on the cooling of other quarters. No alterations may be made to the structure of Company houses without permission obtained from the Management through the Personnel Department. Employees are requested not to leave money unlocked in their rooms as a possible temptation to servants. Company servants should not be tipped as they are adequately paid by the Company. Any incivility on the part of Company servants is to be reported to the Housing Supervisor or the Mess Hall Steward. All communications with our Agents in Bombay or Karachi with regard to Indian employees or other Company matters must be handled through regular Company channels, employees not being permitted to write directly on such matters. Inducing Indians to come to Bahrein for employment except through our Agents is an offence against the Indian Emigration Act and any offender renders himself liable to be dismissed from the service of the Company.8 LAUNDRY Laundry can be done either by the Company Steam Laundry or by Manama Dhobies, the charges being posted on Bulletin boards from time to time. Company laundry collections are made on days specified by Circular and the Manama Dhobies collect and return on Fridays.

PETS No dogs are permitted in Awali, and their importation into Bahrein is prohibited. STOREHOUSE Lists of those permitted to sign for Storehouse ISSUES, ETC. issues for Company operations, transport ation for Company accounts and orders for work to be carried out for the Company are posted on the Office Notice Board from time to time and no one else may sign such orders. Employees may draw articles from the Store house for their own use to be charged to their personal account, provided that such issue does not in any way interfere with Company requirements. Employees wishing to have articles made for themselves or repaired in the Company Shops must obtain an order for the work on Form GO-113 from the Personnel Department.

In no case may employees waive leave and receive double pay. The plans are divided into three sections, viz. :— PLAN ' A ' Leave privileges for those on One year Agreements who complete their whole time of service. PLAN ' B ' Leave privileges for those serving on their first Thirty months Agreement. PLAN ' C ' Leave privileges for those serving on second or subsequent Thirty months Agreements without broken service. I. LOSS OF LEAVE PRIVILEGES No leave will be allowed to an Employee if such Employee's service under his Foreign Service Agreement is terminated— (a) By the Company for cause as defined therein, (b) By the Company without notice as provided therein, (c) By the Employee for any reason, IL LEAVE ON TERMINATION UPON NOTICE FROM COMPANY Employees whose Foreign Service Agreements are ter minated upon notice by the Company (Section IX (a) of Agreement) are only eligible for payment of their salary through date of end of notice period or through the date on which Travel Time plus calculated Foreign Service leave ends, whichever date is the later.19 III. LEAVE PLAN 'A' FOR STAFF EMPLOYEES ON ONE YEAR AGREEMENTS Subject to Regulations in Paragraphs I and II above, on completion of time of service under Foreign Service Agreement employee becomes eligible for 14 days leave and for service in excess of one year to extra leave at the rate of 3 days for every month served over the year or one day for every completed ten days of service over completed month of Foreign Service. IV. LEAVE PLAN ' B ' FOR STAFF EMPLOYEES ON THIRTY MONTH AGREEMENTS Subject to Regulations in Paragraphs I and II above, employees are entitled to three days Foreign Service leave for each completed month of Foreign Service, one day's leave being allowed for each complete ten days period of Service over a completed month. Salary for Foreign Service leave will be at the rate at time of proceeding on leave provided no salary increase has been received during the preceding six months. In the latter event salary for leave will be the average of salary earned during the last twelve months of his Foreign Service. In addition. Employee is allowed twenty-five (25) days leave away from Bahrein during the second year of his Agreement period or fourteen (14) days leave in Bahrein during the same period. When this leave is taken away from Bahrein an allowance of Rs. 450/- is credited to employee's account on his return, except in the case of Employees taking short leave by Tanker where the allowance is reduced to Rs. 200/-. Transportation and expenses for members of Employee's family during this short leave are for Employee's account. Should Employee request Company to make bookings for his short leave the cost of which are in excess of Rs. 450/- he will be required to deposit with the Company at the time that bookings are made a sum sufficient to cover the difference between the cost of bookings made and Rs. 450/-. During short leave under this plan, if taken away from Bahrein, employee may retain his quarters allotted by the Company but is not entitled to payment of Living Allowance.20 In general no restriction will be placed on the locality in which an Employee elects to spend his short leave but the Company reserves the right to bar any locality which in their opinion may be an undesirable locality for employees to visit. Should short leave be taken in Bahrein or Saudi Arabia employee is entitled to continue to draw living allowances of which he may be in receipt but does not receive any short leave allowance. Salary for short leave under this plan is salary at the time of commencement of leave. For the purpose of calculating Foreign Service leave due, short leave taken is considered as Foreign Service. Short leave is non-cumulative and cannot be waived and added to Foreign Service leave. Should an Employee at the request of the Company proceed on his Foreign Service leave at a date earlier than the date of expiration of his Foreign Service period he will be granted in addition to Foreign Service leave already earned half the difference between Foreign Service leave earned and full leave for his complete term of Foreign Service. On the other hand, should Employee at the request of the Company not proceed on leave till after the expiration of his Foreign Service period he will receive in addition to Foreign Service leave earned under the above plan extra leave at the rate of one day per complete month after expiration of Foreign Service period. V. OPTIONAL LEAVE PLAN 'C' FOR STAFF EMPLOYEES ON SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT 30 MONTHS F.S. AGREEMENTS Employees serving under second or subsequent 30 months Agreements without broken service may take advantage of the following optional plan, but in order to allow of Company scheduling reliefs, must inform the Company in writing of their intention of doing so before the expiration of twelve months of service under current Foreign Service Agreement.21 Take the Foreign Service leave earned by them, or any portion of it over 25 days, away from Bahrein at the expiration of 18 months Foreign Service, with an allowance of £120, payable £60 at departure and £60 on return but without travel time or Family Trans portation Allowance, employee agreeing in writing to serve eighteen (18) months further period of Foreign Service on his return from leave, at the end of which employee will be entitled to the balance of Foreign Service leave earned during both subdivisions of his Foreign Service period and to Travel Time and Travel Allowance as laid down in his Foreign Service Agreement for return home on completion of Foreign Service. For the purpose of calculating Foreign Service leave due on completion of second subdivision of Foreign Service period, any Foreign Service leave taken after first subdivision of Foreign Service period is not counted as Foreign Service. General regulations as to salary, allowances and duration of Foreign Service leave laid down in Plan ' B ' apply in Plan ' C,' except that employees occupying family quarters may be required to relinquish them on proceeding on leave after first 18 month period and to occupy different quarters on return. COMMENCEMENT OF LEAVES Foreign Service leave of an employee under Plans ' A ' and ' B ' above will be considered as commencing the day following the date of expiration of Travel Time allowed by the Company in accordance with Regulations governing Travel Time and Travel Allowance. Foreign Service leave taken after first 18 months under optional Plan ' C ' will be considered as commencing on the date of departure from Bahrein and terminating on date of return, the same ruling applying to Short Leave under Plan ' B.' Holidays occurring at the commencement of, during, or at termination of Foreign Service or Short Leave will be considered as part of the leave.22 FAMILY REGULATIONS I DEFINITIONS A — The term ' Company ' refers to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited.

IC ' 5 Xtv His Britannic Majesty's political Agent Manam, Baiirein Island# Dear Sir: Two of our Casoc employees, namely h« I o panakal and ^Ulah Bux, holding British inaian passports Nos« 122546 and 70953 respectively, are desirous of obtaining employment with The Bahrein petroleum company Limited# Due to curtailment of operations in Arabia, casoc had decided to cancel the Foreign Service Agreements of these two men and return these men to India but it so happens that both these men \vould fit into the Bapco organization very well, and as both cascc and the men themselves have no objection to their being employed by Bapco, I ask your assistance and permission in helping these men secure employment with Bapco# I under stand from you, and so do the British Indians in question, that if they undertake employment with Bapco, it will necessitate their signing a new Foreign Service Agreementp but if this new agreement cannot be signed in Bahrein Bapco would not be interested in taking on these men, ^rould you therefore ascertain from the jbrotector of ^migrants at Bombay whether these men might not sign their new contracts in Bahrein, and pending the time that these men might hear from you in this matter could they not enter the employ of Bapco with the understanding that if the protector of l?nigrant»s decision is an adverse one the men will be returned to India under the terms of their present contracts with casoc? For your information, I attach hereto the passports of R# i, ^anakal and Allah bux together with copies of their foreign service agree ment s • Ro I# panakal had just reached Bahrein from India when he was in formed that Casoc had no further need for his services# 7fe gave him his choice of either accepting one month f s pay and returning to India in accord ance with Clause 10 of his FSAf or if ho so desired he might receive employ A'ith Bapco who are interested in acquiring his services# However, Bapco is only able to offer panakal a starting rate of Rs 6/- per working day or a minimum wage of Rs 156/- per month* Rather than return to India, panakal would prefer to enter the employ of Bapco (who would liice to have him), but if Bapco takes him on, his salary, as I have mentioned before, will be Rs 1/- lower per day than he would have received from Casoc# Also, if Casoc cannot trensfer this man to Bapco without paying the one month f s salary in lieu of notice to terminate his contract, in accordance with Clause 10 of his FSA» Casoc would prefer to return fta j^anakal to India# The attached letter from panakal indicates that he would prefer to remain in Bahrein if you can so arrange it with the protector of Emigrants.N^» PA-V53 - 2 - Dec. 15, 1940. Mr» All^ Bux, Electrician, was in the employ of casoc from July 11, 1940 until the present time. He has previously worked for Bapco for some four years and in view of their former experience with this man and their knowledge of his work, Bapco would like to obtain his services# He also was given the option of receiving one months salary in lieu of notice to terminate his contract and return to India or accept a transfer to Bapco if it could be arranged. I attach hereto a letter to Casoc attesting to the willingness of this man to remain in Bahrein rather than return to India, If it can be arranged, Allah Bux will be placed on a 1-year contract with Bapco and H. i, ranakal will be placed on a 30-month contract with Bapco. Please advise if there is any further information I may give you in connection with these two men. As the men themselves are rather anxious to enter employment of Bapco, and as the men are receiving meal allowances and salary XKXJL*. from casoc at the present time, I trust you will give your consent to allowing the men to enter the employ of Bapco pending a decision from the protector of Emigrants as to whether or not they may sign new Foreign service Agreements here in Bahrein. itfay I repeat again that if new contracts cannot be signed here in Bahrein, both men will be returned to India, Bapco have told me that they would not be interested in obtaining the services of these men if they cannot be employed here.

The Bahrain Petrolenm Company is anxious to employ both tbese men and have applied for perrpisslcn to have their services transferred and fresh contracts prepared.

The starting wa^es of Panakal has been reduced to the ncrmal beginning rates of a turner employed by Bahrain Petroleum Company, as neither Company has any knowledge of his work. Alia Bux on the ot;er hand has previously worked for Bahrain Petroleum company and knowing his capabilities they are prepared to pay him at the rate specified in his Agreement with California Arabian Standard Oil Company, ^oth men have signified their desire to accept/2 accept the transfer the conditions of which h ^ve been fully explained to them* The Conrpanies however wish it to be clearly understood that if the contracts cannot be completed here both men will be returned to India and not re-employed« signed in ry presence would be sent zo you for registration.

May 10, CON-805 His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir, You will remember that last month Mr. Ayto, Ifc. Kellenberg and I called on you and, amongst other things, discussed some of the complaints being made in Bombay to the Protector of Emigrants by our repatriated employees. Apropos of this discussion I enclose two brief memoranda; one on Clause 3 of our Foreign Service Agreement, which refers to hours of work, about which we WDUld welcome your opinion; and one on the case of Akhtar. On this case the Protector of Emigrants has given a ruling which to us seems faulty. If it is your opinion that the Protector of Emigrants should revise his judgment would it be possible for you to communicate with him? Y oups very truly. Chief Local Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD. Ends.m e m 0 r a ndu Awali May 1, 1941 Clause 3, Paragraph 2 of Foreign Service Agreement: 'The Employee shall during six days of^ each week and during 9 hours of each day work to the satisfaction of the Company and shall also work reasonable overtime and on Sundays and when called upon to do so by the Company for which he shall receive pay ment at the rate of the ordinary wages above specified.' Claims are being made, and in one case at least have been provisionally allowed by the Protector of Emigrants, that the 9 hours of work specified in the agreement include 1 hour for meals. This misunderstanding may have originated in notices published by the Company giving current working programmes. Last winter, for example, the hours were 7 to 11:30 and 12:30 to 4. The Company contends that these hours make a working day of 8 hours, and that an employee can, by his contract, be asked to work until 5 p.m. without extra pay. The other side contends that the published hours comprise a 9-hour day - 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., and that a man working until 5 p.m. is entitled to 1 hour overtime pay. In England a trades union member employed to work an 8-hour day, is on his job for 8 hours, any time out for meals not being reckoned. Thus one programme for factories is work 8 to 12, dinner 12 to 1, work 1 to 5. A more common time-table is work 8 to 12, dinner 12 to 1, work 1 to 5:30, the extra half-hour being worked so that the man may have his Saturday afternoon off. 'Black coat' workers are not usually engaged on an hourly basis but their programme is commonly 9 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 5:30, with the clear understanding that the afternoon session may extend indefinitely, without extra pay, if last minute work comes in. We would be glad to have your opinion of the meaning of the phrase 'during 9 hours of each day workli -0 AKHTAR - Contracted May 6, 1957 Clause 6 of Foreign Service Agreement M While Employee is in the Zone of Operations, Company shall either furnish him with free quarters through available facilities which Employee shall be required to utilize, or grant him an adequate allowance in lieu of free quarters.' Letter given to Akhtar and acknowledged by him before leaving Bombay - May 6, 1937 'It will be necessary for you to live in barasti houses temporarily, which condition may continue for several months after your arrival in Bahrein, This means you will be located some 13 miles from Manama and will have to run your own mess.' January 1, 1958 Letter from Akhtar asking Company^ assistance in getting N.O.C. for his family. January 25, 1958 - Personnel to Akhtar 'Issue of N.O.C. is being recommended on the understanding that the Company will not provide transportation for you to and from Manama daily. Kindly let us know in writing that you have arranged proper quarters in the town for your family. Note that all expenses in connection with the bringing and return of your family are for your account.' February l t 1938 - From Akhtar to Personnel 'I will arrange proper accommodations in Manama. I eon also willing to abide by the conditions set forth in your letter of Janu ary 25th.' November 29, 1958 - From Akhtar to Personnel 'The facilities now offered to Class II-B employees staying in Camp, like coal, fuel oil, etc. are denied to their brother workers who are staying in town or Raffa owing to their having their families in Bahrein. This is quite unfair to us as in addition to being de prived of above facilities we have to undergo additional expenditure in respect of rent, water, lights, etc. I would request you to kindly consider my case and allow me the same privileges allowed to those in Camp or in lieu a suitable allowance.'- 2 - December 15, 1958 Letter from Personnel acknowledging above letter and hoping to give a reply in the New Year. January 1, 1959 Company published notice announcing an allowance of Rs,20/- per month to Class II-B employees not living in Company quarters and having their families in Bahrein with the consent of the Company. This allowance was paid to Akhtar from January 1, 1959. October 19, 1940 From Personnel to Akhtar saying that as his contract was up and as further work was not available for him he would be returned to India. The state of his account and what was due to him in cash and leave were recorded. The letter concludes - 'Your attention is drawn to Clause 22 of your agreement which stipulates that should you have any complaint to make, the matter should be submitted to the arbitration of the Political Agent in Bahrein.' October 22, 1940 - From Akhtar to Personnel 'With the Company's permission and N.O.C. my family came to Bahrein in May 1958 and the pertinent living allowance was paid to me only as from January 1959. I am unable to understand why I was not allowed the privilege of drawing the allowance from the period between May 1958 and January 1959.' October 20, 1940 - From Personnel to Akhtar ' note that thf^ temporary housing allowance was not granted to any artizan employee before January 1, 1959, this privilege only coming into force on that date. We are therefore unable to grant you retroactive allowance for any period previous to that date. It is also pointed out that on arrival you were given quarters in the Company Camp and previous to the issue of the above-mentioned circular (presumably the notice about living allowances) you had not received permission from the Company to live elsewhere.' On returning to India Akhtar lodged a complaint with the Protector of Emigrants. The essence of the complaint was that the Company had re fused him a living allowance for the period May 1958 - January 1959 because he had not had peimission to live elsewhere than in the Company's quarters, although he had the Company's permission to bring his family to Bahrein.- 3 - After correspondence / the Protector of Emigrants ruled that because the Company had specifically stated that they would pay for neither the passages of Akhtar's family nor his own daily transport to and from Manama, it was equally 'absolutely imperative' for the Company to have specifically stated they would not pay him a house allowance in lieu of free quarters. 'In the absence of such specific conditions the complaintant is rightly entitled to have a house allowance from May 1938 to December 31, 1938.' To me this ruling seems faulty for three reasons; 1. Permission to bring his family here cannot possibly be construed as permission for Akhtar to cease to 'utilize' the Company's 'available facilities' in the way of free quarters. The Company 1 s statement to Akhtar that 'The Company will not provide transportation for you to and from Manama daily' has been read as granting permission to live out of Camp, This is an unjustified reading. The very- positioning of the words 'to and from' seems to indicate that it was realized Akhtar would want to visit his family after work and return that evening. Each day he is to go to Manama and then come from Manama, Had it been the Company's indention to speak of transport for a man living in Manama the position would be reversed - 'from and to' - a journey from Manama in the morning and a journey to Manama in the evening. ^ ^ ^ 2. If the Company had in fact given Akhtar permission to live out of camp no number of 'specific conditions' could have re leased the Company from its agreement to pay an allowance in lieu of quarters. Hence there was no need to make such a statement. Further, if permission was not granted the Company was under no obligation to state any specific conditions. According to the Protector of Emigrant 's ruling, it would be as reasonable to say that, because the Company does not make a specific statement that it will not supply clothes and footwear to its employees, all employees are 'rightly entitled' to have free loincloths and sandals. I would go so far as to say that this absence of a specific statement about Akhtar's house allowance is strong evidence that he did not have permission to vacate his free quarters. 3. In Akhtar's letter of November 29, 1938 it seems to me quite clear that he realized that in asking for an allowance he was asking the Company for an indulgence, and not demanding what he thought was, by the terms of his agreement, a legal due. Had he had permission to live out of camp, an allowance would have been his by right and he would not, several months after leaving camp, have begun to ask for it as a favour.No.983-28/14 Political Agency, Bahrain* 26th llay, 1941. @ To T^ie Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buahire.

The remaining 3 days I claimed at Bahrain, but instead of paying me this amount claimed they have deducted those Rs* 9/- of 3 days which were paid by the Bombay Office* The reasons were not disclosed to me by the Bahrein Office and therefore I claim 6 days' food allowance at Rs* 3/- per day. 4* Rs* 35/- (Thirty Five) withheld by the Bahrein Office for settlement before you as mentioned in the enclosed letter I claim this amount too. 5* I was settled by the Company at Bahrein on and for 31st May 1941 and embarked for Karachi on 4th June, at 8 p*m« and I, therefore, claim 4 days 1 salary for the above period* 6* Living allowance was paid to me by the Bahrein Office upto the 31st May, 1941 whereas I lived in the house upto 4th June 1941, I claim living allowance full Rs* 35/- as usual* 7* Further to my above claims I also claim the remaining period of my 2nd Contract which was for three years and the Company after the llmonths 1 services made me away showing the baseless word of organization as reason in the notice* Trust the above you will find reasonably and genuinally clailaed by me and as duty bound I shall ever remain thankful for your kindness* I beg to remain, etc*, Sd/ Abdul Karim, Store-clerk* c/o Imam-ud-Din, Master Tailor Quettawala, V &amp; P.O.

Sir, To The Political Agent, Bahrain. New Custom House, Bombay, 16 th June, 1941. ?■ With reference to your letter No. 984-28/14 dated the 26th ultimo, I have the honour to state that though a provision has been made for arbitration in Clause 2^ of Lhe agreement of an emigrant for any difference or dispute which arises as to the true intent of the agreement and if an emigrant fails to refer his case or complaint for arbitration he cannot be debarred from placing his case or complaint before me and I as Protector of Emigrants am responsible to investigate his case or complaint placed before me and. give my decision in the matter. Against my decision the aggrieved party can according to law appeal to the Provincial Government within three months of the date of the said order. 2. The provision in the emigrant's agreement as to arbitration has been inserted by Government in order to facilitate and help the emigrant in case of dispute while in a foreign country. It is not to be considered as a binding clause on the emigrant and he is not precluded from appealing to me or to Government to redress his grievances, in case he has not taken advantage of the arbitration clause. 3. In the case under reference emigrant H.A.Akhtar had filed a complaint before me and after hearing from the Bahrein Petroleum Co., I.td., a decision has been given by me. I have the honour to be.

An extract from a communication from the Bahrain Petroleum Company to the Political Agent, Bahrain, on the above subject, is forwarded herewith and an interpretation is requested of the disputed clause of the agreement. Although the Com^any^ contention appears f^ reasonable, no opinion can be offered on so technical a subject. ' -v (&lt;£r? v for Political Copy to the Political Agent, Bahrain, with reference to his Memorandum No.983-28/14, dated the 25th May, 1941, tv^. \x \I ij D.O.tfo •1668-28/14 Dated 10th August, 1941. r m A case has occurrsd since you left Bahrain, of an employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ Taj Din by name, v»ho contended that a loss of sight which he had sufferred should be regarded as an industrial injury (the Company contesting this). He had been discharged and was leaving for India the next day and declined to accept the arbitration of the Agency, stating that he prefers to placs his case before the Protector of immigrants • 2. The Company refer to clause 22 of his agreonent H If any difference or dispute shall arise as to the true intent of this agreement or any part thereof or in any way connected with or arising out of the same, the decision of which is not herein** before provided for, the matter shall be submitted to the arbitration of the Political Agent, Bahrain whose decision in the point shall be final and conclusively binding on both parties, and contend that this makes the Political Agent's arbitration ob igatory on the parties. 3. Jackson and I have discussed this carefully, and agree that the Company's view is erroneous. Paragraph one of the second schedule of the Civil Procedure Code shows that arbitration must be agreed upon by both parties; and section 23 of the Indian Contract Act lays down that no contract may defeat the existing law^^inder section 20 of the Civil Procedure Code, the employee is perfectly justified in suing in the place where the contract was signed. 4. as these disputes normally are only brought to us when the contract is being terminated, and we are usually asked to decide them between the time when the ship rounds Koharraq and drops/ : cr R.G.K.V. Alban, Political Agent, Bahrain, Karachi .iT - 2 - (in ) drops anchor at the buoy, we should, as far as this goes, have no object in trjr r ing to keep these cases within the cognizance of the Agency Court. The Company - if they chose, which I believe they do not - *4 better able to represent their case in India, than an employee to represent his case in Bahrain (unless he wishes to wait on at his own expense until it is settled). I am quite satisfied therefore that I did right (parti cularly in your absence) to refuse to compel the employee to accept arbitration here. It would, however, be interesting to know whether the Protector of Emigrants is duly established as a court under the Civil Procedure Code; as the legal arguments given in my paragraph 3 depend, I fancy, on this question. do not want to prejudice employees In getting satisfaction from the Company; but equally in times when the Company f s production is of vital importance to us, we do not want them given unjustifiable trouble with their Indian employees: and it does meem to ne that they are, to say the least, unlikely to get impartial consideration if they have to appear before the Protector of Jbimigrants, whose very title indicates that he must be counsel, judge and jury in a case where an emigrant is involved. 7. 1 shauld say that, as the Protector of Emigrant himself countersigns contracts with a clause stating that M in case of dispute ••• the matter shall be submitted to the arbitration of the Political Agent M , he should be considered as having voided his «wn claim to the position of arbiter, even though (as argued in my paragraph 3) he cannot be held to have voided the jurisdictior of the Indian Civil Courts. 8. As I see it, the contracts cover the possible relations between Company and employee so thoroughly, that if we allow the Protector of Emigrants to establish the contention made in his letter No.21 dated 16th June (copy enclosed for reference), authority of the Agency in these Islands will be seriously weakened, and British Indian subjects in general will cease, as in the pre seat cas^ to look to it for protectloi:.(^) 9« la it therefore possible,for a etart, to diecover whether the Protector of Emigrant? is a Civil Court; and if not, to establish the principle that, in cases of industrial disputes the^ possibilities are (a) agreed arbitration before the Political Agent, (b) a case in the Agency Court, or (c) a case in a regualr Indian Civil Court.

The Company's representative can then raise a plea of 'res Judicata'; and we can probably handle the Protector of Emigrants pretty roughly if he attempts to review the Political Agent's decision, or to raise any question of his competence to hear such cases. 6* I think, however, that it would be wise, in view of the evident present trend to avoid the Agency's arbitration, to examine the legal basis of our compensation coiomittee meetings* I have maintained in paragraph 3 of ny preceding letter that submission Vajor R*Q* Alban, C.3.K*, Political Agent, Bahrain* (Camp Karachi)submission to arbitration must be on an agrssd basis 9 according to Schsdule II f para 1 9 of the Civil Procsdurs Cods; and you will possibly agres that this vlsvt Is correct*^ courss, so long as ths Company maintain thslr present policy of nevsr contesting a case in India 9 no employee will be likely to agree to arbitration! here; but that is a matter of Company^ policy with which vie are not concerned. I think 5 however i that the lack of such written agreement might be y held to initiate the proceedings of our compensation committee. ■ r 1 /miT 7. I have turned up the file to see on what basis the C0L'iinltte¥ ' was set up, and see that it^ merely on the basis of some noting by Colonel Loch, after discussion with Belgrave and okinner (the then Resident Manager of the Company). It does not appear that the Resident was asked to confirm the arrangement. This noting^of course, wss previous to the settlement of the general question of contracts, and we should probably consider the circumstances to be different now{ our syeten, however, has not changed. 8. I question whether a committee of which a representative of one of the partiej (the Ccmpany) is, so to speak, on the bench and not at the bar, can inspire confidence in the minds of employees. I suggest, therefore, that the composition of comittee be revised by the removal of the Company's reprss»entativ8 CtfoSifteMBtisiptiMPH*, fMMMpnO; and that the Political Agent become sole arbiter - as in the term of the contract - the Company's representative being presant merely to plead his own side of the case, and not in the capacity of a nembor of the arbitration ccmmitTieo.

I am, in this connection to for ward a cc^y of a memorandum from the Protector of Emi^roJits, Bombay, E. No.116, dated the 6th October 1941, in which he points out that the estaolxsiieu practice of several years of nine hours 1 wor^ including one lour for rtcebS should not be modified. Co r y of a memorandum E. No. 116, dated the 6th Octouer 1941, from the Protector of Emigrants, Bombay. 'All employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Ltd., and otner Oil Companies fno firms in Iran, Arabia and Africa, under ti.eir agreements, always worx. six days of nine hours each in a week which includes one hour for tifiin or one hour for recess. Thus actually all employees work only 8 hours perobpc day and should any of the em 1c ees work actually mere than 8 hours per day he is ^aid 'overtime 1 at the rate of the ordinary daily wa^'es specified in the agreement. In 1936 this establianeo practice was fully explained to Mr. Bush, the then agent in Bombay for the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Ltd., and he accepted the establiaheo practice followed by other firms. Clause 4 of the agree ment originally proposed by the Company and forwarded by the Resident under his endorsement dated the 1-8-36 was modified as show in para 1 of the Political and Services Department's note dated the 11-9-41. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Ltd., accepted the modified clause cn conaiti.n as stated in para 3 of the Political ana Services Depart ment's note dated the 11-9-^1 and we did not object to the Company's j^roposal^ Under the clause approved by Government, tue Bahrain Petroleum Co^'s employees work, like the other Oil Companies, six days in a week and 9 hours per day which includes one hour for tiffin but there were a few cases in which the Company made the em loyees work actually more tnan o iuur© per day excluding one hour for tifiin. In these cases the Company asKed to pay these employeps overtime Tor the extra time they worked which the Company did. The stablished practice which is followed since several years and under which the employees are required to work 9 hours per uay including one hour lor tiffin should not be modified as this aas ueen the practice for very ieny years. Besides in the case of the Banrain Petroleum Company the majority cf the employees do not live in the Company's area close to the work, like the employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com i any, but they live about 12 to lo miles away from their work. Though the Company provides frep transport for the employees the employees have to spend about 45 minutes over and above nine hours to go to work and return to their residence ^hich is situated at a place called Manamah. f I meo also state for your information that irregularities and com plaints a^tir .st the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limitea, are more numerous than in the case of any other Oil Companies or employers and the Company is fond of shifting it.s ai^uments from time to tine to suit its own convenience or to meet the case under consideration.'f ' \ Letter from the Chief Secretary to the Government of ^ind, No»32i- F/41, dated the 22nd flanuary 19^2. m*mm ~mm — — mm mm mm mm mm ^ Subject*^ Indian Emigration Act| 1922 - Skilled worKers - Form of /agreement at for artisans - Bahrain Petroleum Company - Interpretation of clause regarding hours of work.

Without any previous mention of it, he has today claimed that he was promised in Bombay an increase of Re,!/- upon his arrival in Bahrein plus ^ daily overtime of four hours. We have ascertained that this claim is entirely unfounded and have informed him to this effect. We have further informed him that his salary will be reviewed semi-annually^ as is done in the case of all our Foreign Service Smployees, and,, any adjustment that may be made will become effective 1st July, 1944. However, he demands a substantial increase in salary immediately and states he will resign if he does not receive it. We do not propose to give in to this demand, which we consider unreasonable in view of his short service. We do not wish to accept his resignation until we have obtained a suitable replacement as we are already very shorthanded in the Machine Shop. We have telegraphed an order to India for ten more men for this type of work and as soon as we have some definite news of the arrival of some of them, we shall be in a position to release Mohamed Naseeb if he still wishes to resign.

But in Bahrein, contrary to iiiTo Grisewood f s promise, I was surprised to find that neither the rupee was added to my pay nor the overtime allowed upto now and that the pay is miserably insufficient. I wish to remind you that I was working for Anglo Iranian Oil Company at Abadan as Foreman for years and my pay was Rs.265/- per month amounting to about Rs.450/- including overtime and allowances. This can be verified by your writing to Anglo Iranian Oil Company, if proof is necessary. My number was 410, Class M« Moreover, I am prepared to stand any test and prove ability in the work. If that is done, I shall need a sufficient raise in ray pay without which I shall be unable to work for Bapco any more.

Dear Sir, The Company is very much interested in the possibility of obtaining labour from South Persia. R?eliminary investigation indicates it is possible that Persians can be brought across from ports of South Persia, i.e., from Bushire Southward, by means of native dhows which are now plying between these ports and Bahrein. The Company wishes to know whether there would be any objection to bringing in Persian labour by this means. Tentative thoughts on the matter are as follows The Company would contact various dhow captains ply ing between Bahrein and South Persia, and make arrangements whereby the Company would pay the dhow captain a sum of money for the fare and food consumed during the journey for each Persian brought over, and who passed our medical examination and was accepted for employment. It v/ould be the responsibility of the dhow captain to return to Persia individuals which were un acceptable . Those Persians who satisfactorily pass the physical examination would be given a G-overnment Work Permit, which would take the form of an identification card. On these cards all pertinent information should be established,and they should con tain the name of the individual, date of entry into Bahrein, preferably a picture, his age, the port in Persia from where recruited, his thumb print and the length of time the permit is valid. It is suggested that permits be issued for a one year period, and if the employee is desired for a longer time, an extension be granted upon request from the Company to the Government authorities. Duplicates of these work permits would be made for the Company files and for the Bahrein Governinent files. If for any reason such employee was discharged, or laid off because of lack of work, his name would be turned over to the Government authorities for review. If the employee was unable to obtain other work locally and at the Governments option/.oi S--His Britannic lvlajesty T s Political Agent, Bahrein: 13/6/1944. option it was decided that the men should be repatriated to his home port in Persia, the Company would immediately endeavour to secure passage for the return journey. The Company would guarantee return passage by native boat to the home port in Persia of labour imported for con struction purposes provided:- 1. The work permit had expired, or the employee was no longer required for construction purposes and had been unable to secure other local employment, or if theGovernment recom mended repatriation. E, Dismissal for Cause, or in the case the employee was found undesirable by the Government. In cases where a Persian accepted employment else where after leaving the Company,the new employer would accept responsibility for repatriation. The Company will furnish housing and will provide rations on the same basis as for local native labour. It is proposed to place the Persian labour on a com parable wage scale as that paid to the local Bahreinis and to pay the same percent bonus as currently paid to these employees. Rations would be sold to imported Persian labour at the same price as sold to Bahreini labour. The above represents our preliminary tentative thoughts as to the arrangements under which such labour would be imported. The Company would be pleased to have the benefit of your comments and if satisfactory arrangements can be evolved, the Company wishes to proceed immediately with the recruiting of this labour.

M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum R5CRUIT!:SIIT OF LABOUR . Reference your Printed Letter No.1741 dated 14th June 1944, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Bahrain, about recruiting Persian labour for the Company's work. Any measures which would be likely to increase the permanent Persian population of Bahrain would be regarded with strong disfavour by the Bahrain Government for poli tical and other reasons. His Highness is already disturbed by seeing a .large number of Persians in Bahrain many of whom have only appeared recently. In spite of our efforts to prevent unauthorised Persians from landing here I believe that during the last year numbers of them have managed to enter the country,, The Bahrain Government has no objection to Persians being brought here for employment on essential war works provided that these Persians go back to their country when the work on which they are engaged is completed® Their position would ressemble that of the Persian divers who come here each year to dive with Bahrain Nakhudas and who return to Persia at the end of the season. Regarding the arrangements suggested in the Chief Local Representative's letter, these are agreable to the Bahrain Government. There is however a suggestion that some Persians may find other employment in Bahrain when no longer needed by the Company. The Bahrain Government does not wish the men who are recruited for particular work to remain here under any circumstances. It is likely that many of them could easily find occupations in Bahrain when no longer required by the Company but it is not only the prospect of their remaining here without employ ment which causes concern to the Government but it is the prospect of increasing the number of Persians in these islands which is viewed with such repugnance by His Highness.

I should also like to point out that with white men freely drinking and fornicating with black women, and as I hare seen, bringing them into houses in Awali, the Indian employee cannot be blamed for losing any respect he might hare had for the white race. He should howerer be able to distinguish an American, with whom he is accustomed to familiarity, from an ex-lritish Army Officer whose position with the Company alone should warrant at least cirility from a rery junior storekeeper, black or white. While I cannot justify ray action of striking the man, I hope you will gire due consideration to the unusual circumstances which in recent months hare magnified to the extreme, and humbly submit my qualifications and past experience for your consideration.

Dear Sir, I have received your letter aa/dc dated December 2nd.1944, advis^ing what appears to be your termination of my Foreign Service Agreement, or in other words I heve been 'fired for cause'. I find it necessary to remind you that on the day of the 'cause'; that is the 11th.of November 1944, on which day, under extreme provocption, I struck an insolent low caste Indian Employee who at my expense was demonstrating his contempt for the white Race to half-a-dozen Arab coolies I offered my resignation from the Company to Messrs. Pifer, Bprkhurst, koser, &amp; Scardino, at the 'Inquest' which was held in Mr.Barkhurst 1 s office. This offer was refused, and I was asked to return to my duties. Since I have given no further cause for dissatisfaction, I can only assume that the Company^ hand has been forced by the Indian directly or by subtrrfuge^/Whatever the circumstances, and especially since I have been refused leave which is due to me and ordered to work on at the Company's convenience, I do feel that I might have been asked to confirm my offer of resignation in writing, given verbally three weeks agoy Since at the moment I am under three months notice ,ordered to continue working in the Refinery, and forfeit all leave and benefits, I think at least I might be granted the fortnights local leave which is due to me, as I have various arrangements to make in Manama, and at -^-'•resent can only get there after Office hours and on Fridays.

(Copy to I/.r.Bflrkhurst (pass to Mr.Moser); H .B .Iv!. f s P .A. ) Confirming our interview of to-day's date, I wish to confirm my offer of resignation, given verbally on the eleventh of November 1944. I wish also to confirm my appreciation of the erabarassing position in which I placed the Company by my action of striking an Indian Employee, and my regret that I have no alternative but to terminate my services three months from that date(11/11/44). Awali. 6th.Dec.1944. i \ / s* f sy //' ■ ■sZy'. I y &amp;Letter dated 9-12-44 from Mr. W.K. Crookshank, Airali, ( Mr. Crookshank had a further interview with me today in which he once more reiterated his difficulties v/ith the Bahrain Petroleum Company at considerable length. It seems that this gentleman had an altercation with an i Indian employee of the Company as a result of which he admits having struck the Indian. An investigation appears to have been held during the course of which Mr.Crookshank offered his resignation to his Company. He alleges that he had no further communication from the Company for a period of three weeks when he was suddenly informed that they had decided to terminate his services under Clause 9A of his Foreign Service Agreement. He appears to have thought, as he now admits, incorrectly that this termi nation of service was for 'cause'. Further, he preferred to have it recorded that he left the Company on his own . t . x initiative and persuaded the management to accept his resignation under the same clause of his Foreign Service agreement. The result was that at the end of the three months period of notice he would be able to find his own way at his own expense to any part of the world he desired and the company would provide him with a letter indicating that his services were terminated on his own request. /i 2. Mr, Crookshank is anxious for the company to pay his passage to the United Kingdom, in spite of his having taken the initiative in resigning and thereby absolved them from the legal obligation to do so. I explained the position to him xx clearly that: (a) the Company were not liable as he had himself termi nated his services, (b) the Company would in any event have only been requirec to return to him to Port Elizabeth and not to the United Kingdom as Port Elizabeth his 'home' in accordance with the contract which he had himself signed, and (c) his suggestion that he might sue the company for arrears of pay as he alleged their representative in East Africa had engaged him on a basic salary of £ 36, - a month whereas he was in receipt of only £ 30/-a month was not a very good one as his own lawyer, in the letter which he showed me from that gentleman, had indicated that his only redress would be to resign /hishis appointment and he would find it difficult to explain why he had signed-and served a contract at £ 30/- a month for a year without taking legal action to recover his rights. 3, I advised Crookshank to stop kicking against the | pricks and to settle down to serve his period of notice without further irritating the management of the company. I gave it as my opinion that he would be well advised shortly before his period of notice had expired to ask for an interview with Mr, V/ard Anderson the General Manager and put the case clearly and soberly to him stating that he was anxious in order that his future prospects of employment should not be prejudiced to resign rather than have his services terminated by the company that he had not realized that by so doing he had forfeited his rights for a passage and that he now asked Mr. Anderson whether the company would be prepared to reconsider their decision with regard.to paying his passage and grant him that privilege. 11-12-44P.O.Box 32, /f^V Awal1 . v y His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, 9th,December 1944, Manama. Bahrein Island, ^ ^ Bahrain ^etrfpt Si , V«-..A- —■ Di ' : ' ■' * 0 - L - L t ** Ij'urther to^conversation and correspondence on the subject of the termination of my foreign Service Agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company, forced by their unwillingness to face the publicity of an Indian Jfcaoloyee, ( James Adolph Diae), whose hold over the management is such that they have retained his services, I shall be grateful if you will record the following:- I was engaged by a responsible aeotoe# representative of this Company, (Mr,J.P.Butcher, Manager of the Port Slizabeth branch of Caltex (Africa) Ltd.), with a promised commencing salary of £36 per Month plus 20^ Cost of living allowance, six months leave at the completion of two and a half years service, and a guarantee of continuity of employment given (unknown to him at the time) to my Solicitor, He also stated that he had'turned down' over a hundred applicants, which I very much doubt. On arrival in Bahrein I was offered a Foreign Service Agreement at a commencing salary of £30 per Month, with three months leave plus travelling time at the conclusion of two and a half years service, and no guarantee of continuity of employment.In the Agreement is a clause which reads 'itoployee was furnished transportation from Port Slizabeth,hereinafter referred to as Employee^ Home ,, . At the time of reading this, I pointed out that my home is in London, and that I had no wish to return to S.Africa. I was however informed that I would be entitled to a passage to S.Africa, and P^^ce there was little difference in cost, I would not lose by it. In spite of this , I wrote in to the Company in March 1944, enclosing evidence that my home was in London, and that I wished this to be recorded in their records. Mr. A.Ayto informs me that this has been done, and that if I had completed my contract, the Company would have provided me with a passage home(London). In the letter I received from the Company, which they have since withdrawn in favour of accepting my resignation, my Foreign Service Agreement was terminated by them under Clause IX (a), under which, the following ruling of Clause XII (a) applies, 'Company shall pay all necessary expenses of Employee f s passage to his Home of the class and by the route designated by the Company and pay Employee up to the date on which Employee would ordinarily reach his Home travelling by the said route or up to the date of termination, whichever date is the later'. Now however that they have withdrawn their belated letter, in favour of accepting my offer of resignation given three weeks &amp; previously and which they at first refused, I am informed that, since I have resigned, I am not entitled to any passage, but that^wlll generously provide me with a tanker passage to South Africa, (which they know is not my home and that I have no desire to go there). Vfith regard to the question of my commencing salary, I was interviewed by the Asst. General Manager (Mr.Russel Brown) in the presence of Mr. Goodyear of the Personnel Dept. During this interview, Mr.Brown admitted that he had been surprised that there had been no copy of a letter of appointment with my papers which had been sent ahead of me ( which rbservatiof is recorded in the summary of the interview compiled by Mr.Goodyear end signed h y Brown), and then remarked that I should be old enough not to accept0 anything that was not in writing, I was told however that the Company would Write to the Oaltex head office in Capetown. Mr. A.Ayto informs me that this was not done.I enclose a letter I received from my Solicitor, and a letter from Mr.J.P.Butcher exonerating himself, in which he makes the unfortunate error of stating:- 'If you will now refer to the letter of appointment dated 9th Nov. 1943, handed to you prior to your departure from Port Blizabeth, you will note that we quoted your starting salary as £30 per month and as you did not raise any objection at that time, in fact as far as we can recall you expressed entirr satisfaction with the arrangements nade^ we still cannot understand your advices'.I do not doubt that Mr.Butcher compiled a letter of appointment on the 9th.Nov.1943, but the remainder of his statement is a complete fabrication. I left Port Elizabeth on the 8th.of Nov.1943, which fact I can very easily prove, and was not given any letter of appointment by Mr.Butcher or anyone else in Port Elizabeth, nor did I^express entire satisfaction with the arrangements made' 1 , my chief compliint being that I had no written confirmation of my rate of pay. Mr.Butcher stated that this was finally decided in Bahrein, and that he could only assure me verbally that I would receice the maximum commencing salary (At the time, £36+20^). On arrival I found that this was not the case at all, and that Lr.Butcher had deliberately misled me. Having since received an increase in pay bringing my rate to £36+20^ I decided to forget the matter.(Incidentally, this is now the commencing rate being offered to Afrikaans schoolboys with no experience of anything, and no compensation has been made to men like myself who have sufficient experience to warrant a higher rate of pay) As far as my leave is concerned, the Company still refuses to grant me my 'Local leave 1 of a fortnight, which is due any time after a year's service, taken at the Company's discretion. As I have already explained to you, the 1^5 is no reason why this should not be granted at the moment, andT^epartmental Toreman yesterday expressed surprise that it had not been. I think I had already mentioned to you that Mr.Barkhurst (The refinery Superintendant) had stated thqt Mr.Pifer was responsible for most that has happened, or as he put it 'Mr.Fifer has shot all the bolts in your case', and promised to take up the question of my local leave with Mr. Fifer, apparently without success. Apart from this, I have from the 8th,Nov.1943 to the 11th.Jeb.1945 (termination of contract) accumulated leave,at 3 days per month, of 45 days. ^^#&lt;6 Not only have I been refused the time off, but I have to-day been informed that I am not entitled to the 45 days pay. Since my offer of resignation ( given in the presence of Mr.Fifer) was refused by Mr.Barkhurst, and I was three weeks later summarily dismissed by Mr.Pifer, and then given four hours notice to pack and be on a tanker bound for S.Africa, without being given any opportunity to make any arrangements, or being asked if I had any plans,I think Mr.Fifer's action in refusing to grant me any leave, and fining me for time taken off, suggests that he is anxious that the matter should not be contested. His further action of 'screwing' me over Leave, and Pay, apart from my passage, without my having given him any cause to take such vindictive action, suggests that for some reason, rfc^l's ly Tasmoyfltd iritlthB® wdeptf. irfiat passagto-nd. i ne^d hardly add that but for the unreasonable attitude at present being displayed by Mr.Fifer, and possibly from necessity backed by Mr.Anderson (although I have no reason as yet to suppose this) I would not be writing to you as I am now. Rumour runs riot in Awali, but I think it might be of interest to interrogate Mr.James Adolph Dias, as two men with over eight years service have told me that the pull he has over3/ the mpnagement has nothing to do with the emmigration controller in India. Both these men were perfectly J—JfCMMfriMO sober and fire of sound mind, and informed me that the reason the management has kept this boy on inspite of the trouble he has given in the past, and the reason that they have kept him on now, is that they are particularly anxious to keep his mouth shut over an unfortunate incident connected with an American member of the management and an Indian woman, whether this was his wife or daughter they refused to disclose, and also refused to state who in the management was concerned. At first I completely discredited the story, and do not like to believe it now, but since the two men told me the same story independently, and neither are given to 'scandal mongering', and since both of them are middle-aged and well established with the Company, I do not believe they would risk their job« and a libel action unless their had good reason to believe what they told me. Probably considering me a 'hot headed irresponsible youth'/ they refused to disclose the identity of the Indian woman or the American concerned, merely stating that James Adolph Dias was known to be despise^d by his fellow Indians, and that in spite of his known contempt for 'Sahibs', and his inability in the Awali g8rage,&lt;d##dB5SBi* he was removed to the small store where he is now working in the Refinery, and where, apart from Arab assistants, he is on his own. Responsible only to his American departmental head Mr.R.Chriss. That on more than one occasion he has given trouble, and that on each occasion he has 'Won the toss'. They then stated that if I did not know the reason for this, there was no reason why I shouldnH as it was common talk in the camp at the time. They told me a fantastic story, which as I have said,! do not like to believe, but which would nevertheless explain:- (1). Mr.R.Ohriss 1 s extraordinary behaviour when first investigating the 'row 1 , in that he did not make any attempt to silence the Indian who was jabbering away giving his side of the story without letting roe get in a word edgeways, in spite of my asking him to do so (which should not have been ne.essary),and resulted in my really losing my temper and leaving in disgust. (2). Mr. J.Fifer (via Wr.A.Ayto),suddenly giving me a blunt order of dismissal, and then four hours notice to pack all my belongings and board a tanker, three weeks after Mr.Barkhurst, in Mr.Fife^s presence, had declined my offer of resignation and asked me to return to work. (3). Having insisted on three months formal notice of termination of contract, and refused to accept a passage on a tanker bound for a destination to which I had no intention of going, and could not in any case possibly 'make' in four hours; Mr.Pifer refused to grant me the following day 'off'. I pointed out to him that he could hardly expect a man to be at work the day after he had been fired, as apart from wishing to visit my Bank to make various arrangements, I wa^not unnaturally, a little upset. He replied 'I can see no cause for your visiting Manama'. I was given the day 'off' by Mr.Barkhurst. (4). In spite of there being no reason or sense in my being at work, Mr.Fife^s insistence that I shall not be given any time off to visit anyone in Manama, knowing as he does that my regular day off is Friday. (5). His insistence that I shall not be granted my local leave, in spite of Mr.Barkhurst (the Refinery Superintendent) Mr.Scardino (my departmental Foreman) and Mr.Ayto (Personnel Supervisor) requesting it on my behalf, apart from the written request I put in myself. To me it is increasingly obvious that the Management, for some reason, is unusually anxious that I should have no opportunity of bringing the matter to a head, for some reason I cannot understand. I am, Sir,rye : The following points have occurred to me in connection with the draft agreement 'below. Health Regs, etc . Art 4. This incorporates the Coy's Health Regs, which an'employee is expected to comply with M at his own risk'. i Art 7. An employee will not be entitled to free medical care and hospital treatment if he does not comply with Coy's Health Regs. Art 11. An employee's services can be terminated for non-compliance with uoy's Health Regs. If, therefore, an employee renders himself liable to penalties for non-compliance with the 'Company's Health Regulations', why should he be required (Art 4) to comply with them at'hisown risk'? Half Pay . Art 8. ' or other forced idleness'• This phrase requires elucidation and definition. If at anytime or for any reason the Company find they have not sufficient work for an employee, they can under this phrase put him on half pay. ^^7 Can^ir^cJr- Termination of services &amp; Repatriation . Art lo lays down conditions under which an employee will or will not be given a free passage to India whereas Art 18 guarantees the repatriation of an employee uncon ditionally. To avoid any ambiguity Art 18 should read:- 'Company guarantees the repatriation of employee subject to the provisions of Clause 13.' Zone of operations . The Coy's 'Zone of operations' is defined under their concession. The words 'or any other locality' are *1 ambiguous, unless they are meant to include CASOC. v h fc-jufb's (sd &lt;*. If.? X&lt;oS aj, ' c • -i i r s/-&lt;«^vc ^ ^/ir 06^#- u bfji^- a I have the following remarks to make on the draft agreement. Article 1 and elsewhere , I cannot see any point in talking about the 'zone of operations' when these people are to be recruited in Bahrain for work in Bahrain. The Company should be asked if they have any objection to substituting 'Bahrain' for 'zone of operations'* wherever it occurs. Article 7 If the Company accept the above, the first six words in Article 7 can be eliminated. This article refers to certain health regulations, of which we have no copy. We should most certainly require a copy of any such regulations before approving the form of agreement or before countersigning any agreement between the Company and an employee# Article 11 Similarly we must know what are the Company 1 s 'regulations or instructions' non-compliance with which a would be/cause for summary dismissal. In this same article the words 'or an allowance' presumably mean an allowance for food. If so this should be made clear. IArticle 13 I do not like the wording of the first sub-paragraph this article. It apparently qualifies sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) and if so it should come below those sub-paragraphs. It apparently means that if the employee wishes to use the free transportation offered by the Company and to have any vacation to which he may be entitled he must leave Bahrain by the boat on which the Company book a passage for him. If this is so why not say so ? I do not understand the meaning of the words in brackets at the end of sub-paragraph (b). Since this agreement refers to employees locally recruited in Bahrain there is no need to refer in sub-para- graph (c) to the employee paying expenses of his passage and the words 'shall pay all expenses of his passage' 1 in sub-paragraph (c) can be omitted, I observe that Article 12 makes it clear that if an employee terminates the agreement before the completion of 12 months then Article 13(c) shall apply. What happens if his agreement is for three years and he terminates it on one month's notice after, say, 18 months of service ? There seems to be no provision for this. Article 14 We must definitely have a copy of the regulations and instructions issued by the Company if we are to approve any agreement referring to these. A rticle 17 Since this is an agreement made in Bahrain for ser vice in Bahrain there is no need to insert the word 'foreign'. Article 18 is, as has been pointed out, in conflict with article 13 and could well be omitted. Article 19 I do not think this article can stand. The employee may have his family in Bahrain before he enters the service of the Company. 1 I j 9 rarticle 20 As noted above there is no need for any definition of 'zone of operations'. Article 21 Instead of the top-heavy phrase 'British Government Officer exercising judicial powers in Bahrain' why not merely sey 'Political Agent, Bahrain' ? 2. There is a 'Nominal Holl of Emigrant' attached to this draft agreement. Since we are not dealing with emigrants at all this will certainly require a new nomenclature. 3. In regard to other points raised by the A.P.A, in his note of the 5th August, I do not think we can quarrel with the Company's intention to pay for passages back to Karachi. This is most definitely a concession on their part in respect of persons recruited in Bahrain and it 'Sfctli be unreasonable for us to try to extend it. 4. We can agree to countersigning agreements made between the Company and the locally recruited Indians, once the form of agreement is accepted and to retain a copy of each agree ment in office. After the first batch has been done, there ought not to be many new agreements to be dealt with. If there are I shall certainly have a good deal to say to the Companyf 5. Meanwhile will A,P.A. please communicate my comments on the draft fom of agreement to the C.L.R. and ask if the draft can be amended accordingly ? / 17-8-1939- F' ft-w /w- i f tUi v 'i- * - m /ss llfty rv&gt;. u'i* -^7 -s-?. c .i./?.3i us' J/ /yi •• t-'*■ ^ i' i f ^ V J' &lt;*^ % frrf/ ^ J' ^ //I' JM -/&gt;. 7.'. i /^' 'i 57. s=r. ^ 1 ; / - *' j-f /y,, tf/f^JC, . /m ^ '- Re, 9 hours 1 working day , Apparently the clause 3 of the agreement means that the lunch hour should be excluded.

From the correspondence enclosed it appears that Akhtar is not entitled to what he claims. Since both these cases are being dealt with in India, the claimant also being in Indie, I suggest that ifcr before we give any decision on the matter, we forward copies of the p.u.c. and its enclosures to the Protector Emigrants in Bombay for comments. ^A/ T Vc }l llv*.

Express letter No. [ r .50-N/39 dated the 19th June, 1939, the Protector of Emigrants and the Government of Bombay have jurisdiction over all the employees who signed their contracts in India or even on those who were only promised a job in India but subsequently the contracts were signed/in Bahrain. If the cause of action arose in India, the employee can,therefore,at his own discretion, file a claim either at Bahrain or India. If thij ♦ is so the clause 22 in their agreements seems ultra vires. In addition tkK clause 22 can be invoked by an employee only if there is a difference cf opinion in the true intent of the agreement, i.e. I am doubt ful if it would be taken as meaning that a persons claims compensation for an injury which he claims he received in the employ of the Co. while the Co. contend that it was not an industrial injury at all. In such cases, it appears, it is not the intent of clause 22 that kxic the matter must be referred tp P.A. and that his arbitration will be final. In such cases, on the other hand, I think, an employee can either claim t; e compensation in the Agency Court as usual ( not under F.A 's arbitration) or go to India and lodge a claim there. If this is so A.P.A. perhaps may like to bring this to P.A's notice. LutouTir A Mm. . pfa oOj/e/sf^/ ^ /'(.
