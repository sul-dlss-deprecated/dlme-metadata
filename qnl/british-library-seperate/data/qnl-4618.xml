Some of the replies from former Political Agents to Pelly’s requests are tongue-in-cheek. No photographs are enclosed in the file. The file notes include lists (folios 17, 19) of the former Political Agents at Bahrain, including their periods of tenure.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Humour</topic></subject><subject><topic>Portraits</topic></subject><subject><topic>Photographs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00013d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
