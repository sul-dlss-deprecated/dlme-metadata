From Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch, G.I.il., political Agent, Bahrain. Po The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushi 1 ^. ^ / A* Sir, . / I have the honour to refer4o the correspondence ending with Major watts' letter N o .497/ d /90 dated the 9th March 1935 about giving certain iniormation regarding motor vehicles to the American Consulate in Baghdad. Just after orders had been received, a further request came from Mr. Paul Knabenshue, the United states Minister in 'Iran, in a more or less personal form,lor certain statistics, #iich I supplied to him. I enclose a copy of the letters, listed in the margin, which passed in this 1. Demi-official ^letter^dated^the^|.st^i.larch^lS.35 ^ ^connection. It will be noticed Demi-oii'icial letter aatea cne ist , f . . from Mr.P* : r» Knabenshue, The United btates / . N&lt;0 Minister, American Oonsulate-Ueneral, B^haad. c: to Lieutenant Colonel G.

Again the request so far as it coneurns the motor vehicles makes no mention of any Consular or Leg tion '(iistrict', that regarding the import and export figures, on the othur hand, mentions 'in its districts 4. On the first occasion, I thought that Mr.Knabenshue, who is aware that we are charged with the foreign relations of Bahrain, had merely used a loose phrase. Now that the ph^se has been repeated in a more formal communication, I feel that it is necessary to report it. 5. Unde-r our Treaty 'vith the Shaikh of Bahrain of the 13th Manih 1692 the United states Gtovemment cannot establish a Consulate in Bahr in, nor can they correspond direct with the Shaikh, and it seems to me to follow that they cannot include the Bahrain Islands in any Consular district of theirs. 6. The United States Legation and Consulate-General have, so far, recognized our special position here (a) by Rlr. Knabenshue during his visit to Bahrain asking me to present him to the Shaikh and expressly saying that he knew that we were chained with Bahrain's foreign relations, .(b) by his writing to me for iniomation and (c) by instructing their nationals to come to me for certain notarial and other services. It may, therefore, be conside^d that there is no need at/- requests, noted in the ma-r^in, which have Letter No.850.31/AJl/gkm dated the 26th January 1936 from the Third Secretary and Consul, _ / , American Consulate General, Baghdad, for the /*' Minister T^sident and Consul General, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, Persian Gulf.

Sir, Your most obedient servant, A Lieutenant Oolonel, Political A^;ent, Bahrain.Ji K D Colonel Fowle has seen your letter No. 539- 10/l of the 23rd February on the subject of the phraseology used by the United. States Legation in Baghdad. The phrase in question 'in its district' is, he thinks, merely a loose one; the United States Legation in Baghdad are probably asked by the^V Grovemment to produce such statistical information as they can gather about the Gulf area. Colonel Fowle agrees reference last sentence in your paragraph 6 that there is no need to take any action in the matter.J*** wlTBRTIQHHAIEE 1.
