In continuation of latter No. 16 C., dated the 31st January 1909, I have ^2j /&gt;7 the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a report by Mr. McManus, Deputy Superintendent of Telegraphs, on the present distribution of Helmand water below the Ju-i-Afghan. The report appears to have been carefully compiled. 2. The chief points to bring to your notice are as follows:— {a) The new Afghan cut opposite Nad-i-Ali. This cut was completed in 1909. Dp to the present, owing to the good floods, this cut has caused no inconvenience, but in a year of scarcity of water, this cut might be the cause of disputes. (b) The floods of this year have widened the mouth of the Ju-i-Afghan and therefore causing the river to flow more freely along this channel. (&lt;?) The discovery of the ruins in the bed of the Ju-i-Afghan near Kang- i-Amir Mohammed. These might prove worth further investigation next autumn when the water is at its lowest. 3.

McManus, Esq., Deputy Superintendent of Telegraphs, Seistan, To— Major F. McConaghey, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain. I have the honour to report on the canals from Band-i-Shah Gul to Deh Dost Mahommed, which I took the opportunity of inspecting while on a tour of inspection of the boundary pillars from 52 to 76. 2. As some very important changes have been made since Captain Daukes’s visit in January 1909, these will be best understood by my reporting on the same points referred to by him. Ju i-Afghan. —I crossed the Rud-i-Pariun below the place where the Band’i-Shah Gul is usually built ; at the time of my visit there was no Band as the greater volume of water was flowing down the fresh cut referred to in Captain Daukes’s letter. This channel is about 40 feet wide by 12 deep, with a swift current. The people of Kang-i-Amir Mahommed on the right bank informed me that the floods at the beginning of the year scoured out this channel making it considerably wider and deeper. They pointed out to me some ruins of pacca brick a few feet below the surface of the water and running at right angles to the bed of the channel, which they told me was ex posed by the flood. I noticed the bed of the Pariun just below the mouth of the Jui-i-Afghan considerably silted up, but as there was sufficient water in the Helmund a good supply was flowing down the Pariun also. Shamsuddin’s canal for Milak. —Opposite Kang-i-Amir Mahommed, on the left bank of the Ju-i-Afghan, Shamsuddin Khan has reopened this canal; at the time I passed there was no water in it, but men were clearing the tail near Milak before opening the mouth. I did not hear of the Afghans attempting to stop him this year. Old bed of Helmund. —Dry. Channels taking off from the Nad-i-Ali channel.—On the left bank opposite Deh Jamaludin there is only one canal carrying water to Milak. In his report Captain Daukes showed two canals marked Jehanabad 1 and 2, which took off below Milak; at the time of my inspection these took ofl buta few yards ? art ^o. si %“ p L^teftbe coentrjabout Jeba^bad and the lower is called the Khan Jehan Kha A? the Nad-i-Ali stream was deep and swift I was not able to cross to see whether the canal which irrigates the country in the direction of ISad-i-Ah «as open or not, but heard that it was not. i a « \ ” ™ Hip * Not reproduced. noticed that this point is both into the Sikhsar a few hundred yards above the Burj-i-As whence i 'J s b * d houndarv nillar No. 54 in a deep channel cut by the Afghans m the nea of the Sikhsar.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a report by Captain C. T. Daukes on the present distribution of Helmund water below the Ju-i-Afghan. 2. It will be seen that there have been some not unimportant changes in the canals since the departure of Sir Henry McMahon’s Commission. At the present time there is sufficient water for both Persians and Afghans and no dispute of any significance is in progress. If, however, during the next few seasons there should be a shortage of water in the Helmund, disputes are likely to assume an acute form in the section dealt with ; and in this case the report will be of assistance to the Government of India in enabling them to appreciate the situation. _ 3. A copy of this letter and enclosure is being submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Dated Scistan, the 30th January 1909. From— Captain C. T. Daukes, His Britannic Majesty^s Vice-Consul, Seistan and Kain, To— Majok R. L. Kennion, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. I have the honour to submit for your information the following notes made by me recently, while on tour in the Miankangi district, on the Afghan and Persian canals and water-channels between the “ Band-i-Shah Gul” and Deh Dost Muhammad (vide Major Sir Henry McMahon’s map, scale 1 inch to 1 mile^illustrating his boundary award). 2. Ju-i-Afyhan .—On crossing the “ Band-i-Shah Gul” (the old **Band-i- Pariun ” no longer exists) I noticed that the water did not appear to be flowing freely down the head of the Ju-i-Afghan. This has been considerably blocked by sand which is blown off the Beg-i-Pariun by the prevailing north wind. On proceeding about half a mile further dowm the Ju, I found that a fresh cut had been made from the Helmund which meets the old Ju at a point about half-way between the take out from the Helmund and its point of junction with the Nad-i-Ali channel. A good volume of water appeared to be flowing down this cut, and I fwas informed that it had been made in 1908 by the Afghans and Persians working together and without friction. 3. Shams-u-Diris water channel for Milak. —Prom this point I retraced my steps and crossed the Beg-i-Pariun to boundary pillar No. 53. A dry water channel (vide sketch map 4 attached) was found to run from the head of the Ju-i-Afghan parallel to the right bank of the Helmund to a point in the Beg-i-Pariun where it turned oli to the north-east in the direction of Milak. This water channel showed no signs of having held water and is now out of^ repair. On making enquiries, I was informed that it had been constructed in 1907 by Shams-u-l)in Khan, nephew of Khan Jehan Khan, with a view to irrigating the country round Milak (which has suffered from lack of water since the change in the course of the Helmund). The Afghans, however, very naturally refused to allow the water to be taken from this point fearing that a large proportion of the water of the Ju-i-Afghan, already scarcely sufficient for its purpose, would be diverted from the Nad-i-Ali channel. The actual objection they raised was to the effect that the new water channel traversed their territory and could not therefore be made without their permis sion. This is certainly correct, but in any case it appeared to me improbable that the channel would have worked satisfactorily since the sand which bas already partially blocked the Ju-i-Afghan would have had an even worse effect here. i l/vff hJtsCJ&amp;AJ ‘ \not attempt to channel, and it As far as I could ascertain, Shams-u-Din Khan did dispute the right of the Afghans to refuse water for this therefore remained unused. 4. Old bed of Belmmd—^o water now flows down the old bed of the Helmund between boundary pillars Nos. 53 and 52. The bed is therefore dry up to the point where it is met by the Ju-i-Afghan. 5 . Water channels taken off from the Nad-i-Ali Stream. point I followed the Nad-i-Ali channel and the Sikhsar to Deh Dost Muhammad. On the left bank I noticed that two water channels, in close proximity to one another, now feed Milak (in place of one shown on the map) One ot these was recently made owing to the unsatisfactory flow of water down the old channel, and I was informed that they reunite lower down. Neither appear to take off any very considerable volume of water. About half a mile below Milak, a water channel, with a good flow of water, has been recently made by Shams-u-Din Khan. This, I was informed, unites with the canal somewhat lower down (marked Jehanabad water channel No. 2, on the sketch map) and it is one of these canals that Shams-u- Din referred to when speaking to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at their exchange of visits last month. He then stated that disputes had arisen regarding one of these (almost certainly No. 1 which was the last to be dry) and that the Afghans had closed it. At the time of my visit, water was flowing freely down the channel and I could see no signs of its having been recently closed. On the right bank, I noticed that one of the Afghan water channels leading in the direction of Nad-i-Ali was closed, but this may be temporary. None of these appeared to carry off much water. 6 . Lakshak and Deh Dost Muhammad Canal—On proceeding some two miles further down the left bank through dense tamarisk undergrowth, I found that the Lakshak and Deh Dost Muhammad canals are now fed from a point somewhat higher up the river than the spot known as “ fanjul ” {vide marginal note, Sheet No. 2 (5) map of Persian Seistan showing irrigation canals). These two canals take out together. The draw is very considerable and the canal itself very much larger and deeper than any other above it. 7. New Afghan cut.—K few hundred yards further down and at the point where the Nad-i-Ali channel bends to the north {vide sketch), I found that a new cut had been made by the Afghans which is connected apparently with the Shelad-Charkh and which, at the time of my visit, carried off all the remaining water of the Nad-i-Ali channel. ^ Prom this point and onwards as far as bounday pillar 56, I found no water in either the Nad-i-Ali or Sikhsar channels except for a short distance where the united waters of the Lakshak and Deh Dost Muhammad canals rejoin the old bed before separating at the point known as “ Janjul ” {vide sketch). Prom boundary pillar 56 and down to the head of the Bud-i-Gashta, I found water was flowing in the Sikhsar channel: this was brought in from the Afghan side (right bank) a few hundred yards to the north of boundary pillar No. 56, but from such enquiries as I had any opportunity of making, it was recognised that the water belonged to the Afghans. The water followed the old Sikhsar channel to the spot where the Rud-i-Gashta takes out from it, and thence onwards; it was, at the time of my visit, dry. Opposite Deh Rasul Khan, a cut had been made and was actually being repaired and cleaned by men from Bahlol on the Afghan side when I passed by. This cut passes through a corner of Persian territory and rejoins the Sikhsar about half a mile further down. I spoke to some cultivators from the Afghan side who met me here : they told me that the water was carried through the cut and on by the old Sikhsar channel to irrigate the country round Behlol. At the time of my visit, the channel of the Sikhsar showed evident signs of having held water recently. 8. Jahanabad Canals .—On my return from Deh Dost Muhammad I visited Jahanabad and Khadung. A few days later I also visited Gazbar. PI found that Jahanabad and the country surrounding it obtained water not only from the Lakhsak and the two Jahanabad canals, but also from an old canal recently cleaned out and repaired which takes off some three miles below the “ Band-i-Shab Gul 9. Tendency of water to turn towards Khadung.—A. greater proportionof the water of the Pariun than in previous years appears to be flowing via, Khadung and Gazbar (in this connection see covering ^ letter to Water Award from the British Commissioner to the Afghan Commissioner, dated tlm 16th April 1905), and whereas last year the country round Sheikh Wasi was inundated before that round Gazbar, this year the reverse is the case. 10. To sum up :— The Nad-i-Ali channel has been strengthened by a new cut taking out above the “ Band-i-Shah Gul,” dug by Afghans and Persians without friction. (ii) Water channels are taken out on both sides of the Nad-i-Ali channel down to the point marked A on the sketch. At this point the Lakhsak and Deh Dost Muhammad canals take out together aud thence onwards no water is taken by the Seistanis. (Hi) At B, is the new Afghan cut, and from such information as I could gather it was understood that under present conditions the residue of the water which did not pass down the Lakhsak canal belonged to the Afghans whether conducted by the Sikhsar channel or not. The Nadd-Ali and Bahlol districts appear to depend entirely on this canal, and it seems very probable that any disputes which may arise under the present state of affairs will hinge on points marked A and B on the sketch. Both of the canals had a strong flow of water at the time of my visit, but I am inclined to think the Lakshak has the advantage as being higher up the Nad-i-Ali channel, and should the Persians increase the number of their water channels, which are already in excess of those dug by the Afghans, above the Lakshak, it is possible that in a low year, sufficient water will not pass for the new Afghan cut. (iv) The water of the Pariun below the “ Band-i-Shah Gul ” appears to show an even stronger tendency than formerly to turn to the west by Khadung. (v) I heard of no disputes of any importance between Afghans and Persians. Undoubtedly the Nad-i-Ali channel is much silted up, but the fact that a settlement such as that indicated at A and B has been arrived at between the parties, tends to show that no serious friction exists at present.■ Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is cum) mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

(Secret J Extract from the diary of Colonel A. E. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seisian Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 31st December 1904. ******** 19th December 1904, Mouth of the Farrah Bud. —The Akhundzada and his camp arrived to-day. So far the Afghan Commissioner has been content to leave demarcation entirely in my hands, and has shown his confidence by not even having a representative in our camp from the time pillar building com menced from Koh-i-Malik Siah up to now. The case is slightly different now that we have got into the border of the Lash Juwain district of the Earrah province, and the Akhundzada thinks that his further absence may he adversely commented on. The Governor of Lash Juwain, Madat Khan, and his camp, also arrived to-day, and pitched alongside us with the Akhundzada. Troubles began at once. Madat Khan is no friend of the Akhundzada, and, to show his own importance and annoy the Akhundzada, he has started a noisy protest against what he is pleased to call the Akhundzada’s wanton surrender to Persia of the greater portion of the Lash Juwain district. The old Akhundzada, I hear, is very much harassed. To begin with, he has not got over his recent long attack of fever, and is rather knocked up by his journey here. Then the return, as Governor of Kila Path, of Ayub Khan, who is openly hostile to him and the recent change of Governors, in Parrah, have inspired fresh hopes in the minds of certain disaffected members of the Akhundzada’s own subordinates that a fresh crusade against him will be more successful than previous ones. At the head of the discontented faction are the military officers of the Chakansur district. They hate the Akhundzada bitterly, as he does not allow the troops to rob and loot the people in the way they are sometimes accustomed to do elsewhere. The present demarcation work has given a promising opportunity to all these intriguing persons to start fresh accusations against the Akhundzada, and, regardless of the fact that the boundary line has been fully considered and finally accepted by His Highness the Amir, they are concocting various reports to Kabul, complaining that Afghanistan has suffered very heavily from the present boundary settlement. These are based on the most absurd and unfounded grounds. Lash Juwain officials have never been so far south as this, and have little or no local knowledge of this part of the country, However, this intrigue is no new development, and is a common incident in all boundary dealings with Afghans. My chief interest in the matter lies in the fact that the Akhundzada takes the matter much to heart, and is very worried over it all. The Yamin, on the other hand, I should note, has been worrying me for many days to alter my boundary line. He wants it to run further north, so as practically to bring it up here to the mouth of the Parrah Hud, because Persian cattle grazers largely use this tract. He wants me to fix as the Siah Koh either a hill some six miles north of the peak I have fixed, or a hill 13 miles on this, i. e., the east, side of my hill. I have resisted all these attacks, and tried to make the Yamin understand how well Persia has been treated, and how impossible it is for me now to alter the line even if I wished to, which I do not. 20th December 1904, Mouth of Farrah Bud. —I received the Akhundzada and Madat Khan at a Durbar this morning, and all the Lash Juwain officials and Chiefs were presented and introduced. Madat Khan is a swivel-eyed old gentleman, said to be much addicted to opium. No business matters were referred to, and I understand I am to be attacked on these at another interview tc-morrow.2 * Sir Fred. Goldsmid got the name Siah Koh (Black hill), which he did not go near, from people living a long way away from here. Seen from a distance, all these mountains look black. Each peak has a name of its own, and no parti cular one is called Siah Koh. I thought I had found one last year {vide my diary entries of 30th April and 1st to 3rd May 1903), but further consideration and enquiry showed me that that did not fully satisfy the conditions of Goldsmid’s award. Both Afghans and Persians have hitherto recognised as Goldsmid’s Siah Koh, a group of hills called “ Nar Ahu Mada Ahu ” (Male and Female Deer). I fixed on the Nar Ahu, and that is the peak named Siah Koh in my award map. The final map showing boundary pillars will, of course, give both names and show the adjacent peaks also. A. H. McMahon. In the afternoon, the British officers of the Mission gave a small picnic to theYaminat a very picturesque spot near camp, where the iarrar Bud enters the Hamun. 3Ut December 1904, Mouth of the Farr ah Bud.-The Akhundzada, Musa Khan of Herat, Madat Khan, Governor of Lash Juwam, and a few of the Afghan staff paid me a long visit this afternoon. The object of the vrsrt was that I should hear all Madat Khan’s objections and reply to them, as the Akhundzada and his party are tired out from arguing with that irresponsible and illogical individual P Business commenced with a long eloquent oration from the Akhundzada, worded entirely for Madat Khan’s benefit m which the Akhundzada’s endeavours to get a more favourable boundary settlement were dwelt upon, and all the old arguments of last year were repeated 1 replied, also for Madat Khan’s benefit, by confirming the fact of the Akhundzada s earnest efforts during so many months of boundary discussion. I pointed out how and why the present line had been arrived at I showed where it was favourable to Afghan interests, and I made great capital out of the fact that the hill selected as Siah Koh* for th&amp; terminus of the line was one extremely favourable to Afghanistan. I produced a printed copy of the Mission quarter- inch map to illustrate my remarks. I explained the numerous endeavours made by the Yamin to get me to alter the course of the boundary line west of Shalgumi, and how he clamoured for another hill as the Siah Koh which would cut off many miles of country I had awarded to Afghanistan. I pointed out how the line having been finally accepted by both Governments, it was out of my power to change it by the fraction of an inch either to please the Yamin or Madat Khan. All this seemed duly to impress Madat Khan, and I could see that the Akhundzada and Musa Khan were thoroughly pleased. Still more so were they when, as a final test of my integrity as a demarcator, a boundary map sent to the Akhundzada by the Amir was reverently unwrapped from various cloth wrappings, spread on the table and compared with my map. As it&gt; was merely a tracing on tracing cloth of my own award map, comparison was both easy and con vincing. Whether laid on top of my printed map, or whether the distance of the boundary line from various places indicated on the Amir’s map were carefully measured and checked on both maps, the results were found to he exactly the same. In other words, the boundary I am now demarcating agrees, mile for mile, exactly with that on the Amir’s map, and the Afghans withdrew ; Madat Khan visibly impressed, and the others openly pleased. As they left my tent, I took the opportunity of pointing out to them the distant hills, and told them the name of each peak, and which was which. Madat Khan, as I expected, knew the names of none, although he has lived all his life within sight of them. The hill I have awarded as Siah Koh is the southern of a line of these prominent peaks called Nar Ahu (male deer), Mada Ahu (female deer), and Sabzak. Nar Ahu is my Siah Koh. Sabzak is some six miles north of it. I asked Madat Khan if he would like me to change my hill for Sabzak, or for Koh Chako, a smaller peak 3 3 miles nearer, both of which the Yamin clamours for in preference to Nar Ahu. He appre ciated the argument, and departed in good humour. Later in the day, I got a message from the Akhundzada, thanking me for the way I have fiattened out Madat Khan, which, he said, had been thoroughly effective. The boundary pillars up to the eastern edge of the Hamun-i-Sabari will be completed to-morrow, and it had been my intention to give the hard-worked building parties a rest here until after Christmas day, when, having spent Christmas with our whole camp united, I would take a small camp onwards the tw o marches round the north of the Hamun, and finish the remaining 25 miles of line between the west edge of the Hamun and the Siah Koh. This wouldmean keeping the big Afghan camp several days here doing nothing, and I have come to the conclusion that this would be inadvisable. The Akhundzada and his party are out of their own province, and difficulties in the matter of supplies for themselves have already arisen owing to the unfriendliness of Madat Khan. Moreover, the longer they are idle, the more absurd ideas they mav coniure up between them. I have, therefore, decided to forego our Christmas together here, and will start for Siah Koh on the 23rd with Messrs. Tate and Ward and a small camp. The main camp will stay here, as the country onwards is deserted, and fodder is unobtainable. X was surprised to receive an official letter late this evening from the Yamin-i-Nizam, in which he makes a formal protest against the boundary line in this direction. He says it includes in Afghanistan various places where Persian cattle-owners reside during a portion of the year. He asks me to run the boundary line north of my line to Tappa-i-Kharan, and various other Tappas to a place close to our present camp and thence to the Sabzak hill or other hill north of Nar Ahu. I thought the Yamin would have had more sense than formally to advance such a demand at this late stage of the day. However, I am not sorry he has written, as bis letter will be useful to show to the Afghans. 23rd December 1904. —I had no time to write a reply to the Yamin’s letter before leaving, so instructed Captain Ramsay to see him to-day, and inform him that I am absolutely unable to depart in any respect from the line agreed upon by the Persian and Afghan Governments; that the Afghans make similar claims to places south of the line ; that, before giving my award, I had thoroughly enquired into all local conditions, and gave Persia up to the full limit of all she could justifiably claim, while, as regards the Siah Koh, it had j20Y0j« been a question in my mind of choosing a hill noith of Nar Ahu, but one some miles further west than that peak. The hill finally decided upon, i. e., Nar Ahu, was the only one which satisfied all the conditions of the Goldsmid Award. I marched, with Messrs. Ward and Tate and a small camp, to the mouth of the Harut Rud, some 22 miles. The route ran throughout along the beach of the Hamun. The scenery, with the wide stretch of water lying between us and the distant mountains on the left and an occasional line of high cliffs to the right of the route, was very effective. The Akhundzada and his party and Madat Khan also marched with us. The-Yamin is to follow to-morrow. 24th December Marched along the shores of the Hamun to a point of the Hamun bank, south-east of the Koh-i-Chako, and about five miles north of where the boundary line hits this bank. Here we and the Afghans pitched camp. I chose this spot, as I thought that the less the Afghans see of the country beyond the line, barren, desolate, and waterless though it be, the happier they will be. None of them have ever been in these parts before; but I know from experience that Afghans often get more enamoured, and make more fuss over country that is new to them than they do over places they are familiar with. Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah, at my request, showed the Akhundzada in confidence the Yamin’s letter of the 22nd. It had an excellent effect, and the Akhundzada said he would make the most of it if Madat Khan gave trouble again. That worthy has seldom been so far from home in his life, and has broken down, and been left behind at the mouth of the Harut Rud. 2oth December 1904.—Christmas Hay. A heavy storm of wind and rain lasted most of last night, and the noise of the waves breaking on the gravel beach below our camp sounded very homelike. The wind can raise a very heavy sea in these wide Hamuns. The day broke bright and clear, much to my relief, as our progress depends on seeing our last pillar on the other side of the Hamun. A post which arrived this morning brought a very kind and gratifying message from His Excellency the Viceroy, which will always render to-day a very memorable one to me personally.I received, immediately after breakfast, a flying visit from the Yamin-i- Nizam who had crossed the southern portion of this Hamun in tutins yesterday, and camped some eight miles south of this. He kindly rode in to pay me Christmas wishes on his way to Bandan, where he is going in order to examine the country. The result of Captain Ramsay’s interview with him appears to have been satisfactory, and he seems to have convinced the Yamm that my refusal to alter the line is final. He said he only raised the question in the hope he might assist the Persian cattle-owners concerned. He wants, of course, to make as much capital at Tehran with the Persian Government as he can over his efforts in Persian interests, and I pleased him by comirming to-day what Captain Ramsay had told him I would probably do, i. &lt;?., in replying to his official letter, lay all the stress I can on the extent to which my boundary line is favourable to Persia. It is worthy of mention here that he told Captain Ramsay, when the latter in support of some argument produced a copy of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s book describing his Seistan Mission, that he had been given a copy of that book just before this Mission by Mr. Miller, and had been told to treat us like Goldsmid’s Persian Commissioner treated him. He said the donor of the book would be very angry at his having failed to follow Mirza Maasum Khan’s example. This bit of information fully confirms what I noted on this subject in my diary entry of 8th March 1903. The Yamin told me to-day that he has been told to remain on in Seistan after this Mission goes, but I could not extract from him why he is to stay here. He professes not to know himself. The Akhundzada and staff paid me a friendly visit to offer Christmas wishes. Madat Khan also came. Demarcation work progressed well to-day. Mr. Tate was able successfully to align the boundary line some distance towards Nar Ahu, and several pillars were built by Mr. Ward’s working parties. 26th December 1904.—I took the Afghans to see the boundary line from where it hits this shore of the Hamun, for some distance inland. They all seemed thoroughly satisfied. Mr. Tate completed the alignment of the boundary to Siah Koh (Nar Ahu) to-day. The country is absolutely deserted and waterless. I have had it searched for 20 miles round, and not a single native can be found. We were told by our guides last year that Nar Ahu°is quite inaccessible, and it certainly looks it, for the peak on all sides seems nothing hut a vertical cliff. Pillar building necessitates all water for men and building being carried from here. Needless to say, the Afghan commissariat arrangements have proved defective, and they have already run out of supplies. I foresaw this, so am in a position to feed their camp. « 27th December 1904 .—I sent some men accustomed to hill climbino- to Nar Ahu to-day to see if they could find a way up to the summit. They °sent back word that they have failed to do so, and only succeeded in getting * three- fourths of the way up the mountain. Mr. Ward caused us a little anxiety by not returning to camp in the evening. I sent search parties out, and had fires lighted above our camp. He at last turned up at 11 o’clock at night, havin°* lost his way in the dark and going some miles south of camp. 28th December 1904 .—I rode along the boundary line, and climbed to the top of the mountain called Koh-i-Mako, through which the line runs some two miles east of Nar Ahu. The hill is one mass of fossils. Prom the top I was able thoroughly to examine the sides of Nar Ahu with glasses, and came to the conclusion that a good practicable way up to the top can be found by attacking the hill from the south-east corner. I ordered a building party to try that way to-morrow. Mr. Ward volunteered to accompany them, and leaving him here, I returned to camp (38 miles ), and despatched beddin^ and food for him on riding camels. I left with Mr. Ward, Sardar Bano°al Khan who is a splendid man on a hill, and, if he can’t get up Nar Ahu, no one els-here is likely to he able to do so. I much regretted being unable to stay and try the hill myself, but it would raise difficulties with the Afghans, who consider it their duty to accompany me everywhere. As they can neither travel fast nor far, my being hampered with them would mean failure to any attempt to get to the top. I only got away by myself to-day by sending the Afobins off to visit the intermediate portion of the boundary line with Khan Bahadur Mir Chains Shah. They did not learn till too late that ! was not going with them. 'With the exception of the peak of Nar Ahu, the demarcation of the whole line to Siah Koh was completed to-day. The Afghans are very delighted at this and all seem openly pleased with their boundary line Even Madat Khan now expresses some enthusiasm about it, and has evidently decided it is wiser to throw in his lot with those who approve of the^ boundary settlement than risk the results of independent action as a hostile critic. 29th December Hj04.—1 started back to the main camp to-day with the Afghans, who are only too glad to be returning. Our camps marched to the mouth of the Harut Rud. I was able to do the march sailing which was a pleasant change. Mr. Ward rejoined us late in the evening with the pleasing news that the route pointed out by me yesterday up the Nar Ahu proved not only feasible, but easy, and the building parties had no difficulty m getting to th/top of the peak and building the final pillar, No. 90 ot the Seistan Boundary Series. Thus ends successfully our work of demarcation _ It is a great relief to our minds. Whatever little more this Mission may achieve, we have at least left a lasting memorial of work accomplished, and our enemies cannot claim that this Mission has been either a farce or a fiasco. 0/1/i Dprember 1904, Mouth of the Farrah Rud. —We returned to the main camp at the mouth’of the Farrah Rud Mr Ward and I sailed across while our camps followed our previous route along the Hamun shore. I found all well in the main camp. All are heartily delighted at the completion of demarcation work. 31st December 1904, Mouth of the Farrah Dud —Unusual harmony prevails at present in the Afghan camp. The Akhundzada and Musa Khan ‘’ear to have completely got round Madat Khau, who now professes willingness to he associated with the results of the boundary settlement, and will, I ^ hear, attach 'his signature also along with Musa Khan to the letter from the Akhundzada to the Amir, announcing the satisfactory conclusion of demarcation. The Yamin-i-Nizam returned from his exploration of Randan to-day, and seems pleased with himself. The Afghans are to pay him a friendly visit to-morrow. The year 1904 thus closes happily in all our three camps. Enciostjre No. 2. 1 Secret^ Extract from the diary of Colonel A. E.

Camp, Mouth op h are ah Kud. 1st January 1905 —The Akhundzada and Madat Khan, Governor of Lash Juwain, paid a friendly visit to the Yamin to-day, in return for one the latter paid the Akhundzada some time ago. They paid each other compliments on their respective successes in the boundary business, and the Yamin summed up the situation by saying that, as both countries were united m brotherhood as Muhammadans, each should look upon the territorial gam of the other with a brotherly eye. ; * * * * * * 3rd January.— The Yamin, who finds it difficult to feed his camp here, asked permission to go to the south of the Hamun, and departed with his camp to* day.4th January. —I sent the Tamm a formal reply to his letter of the 22nd December, in which he complained of the boundary line cutting off the grazing lands and places of residence of Persian cattle-owners, &amp;c. I pointed out how impossible it was, even if I wished to, now to alter the line, and explained how he had already good reason to congratulate himself on the result of his efforts on behalf of Persian interests. I understand that the Russian Consul and the Karguzar are very busy just now trying to make up a case against the Yamin by picking holes in the boundary settlement. My letter should be useful, in case he ever has to defend his action in Tehran. ***** The week has been employed in preparing final maps and statements regarding the demarcated boundary line for delivery to the Persian and Afghan Commissioners. These take time, and require very careful preparation and checking. Since the departure of Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, the work of translation falls upon Captain Ramsay, who is fortunately very proficient at writing modern Persian. The difficulty is to use language which is equally well understood by both Afghans and Persians. Many words in common use in both countries have an entirely different meaning in each country.

Macpherson, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, for the period 1st to / th January 1905, 1st January, Camp Dahana-i-Farrah Bud. —Reports of news-writers show that the Russian Consul is taking considerable interest just now in Colonel McMahon’s demarcated frontier line, and that mysterious meetings have been held, after dusk, between him and the Karguzar and Haji Saiyid Mir Ali of Aliabad, the influential Saiyid, who recently returned to Seistan. It is said that telegrams have been despatched by the Karguzar and the Deputy Governor to Tehran, that the Yamin-i-Nizam, in collusion with the British Commissioner, has conceded a large slice of Persian territory to Afghanistan, and that attempts are being made to induce the Saiyids to protest also against the line. If it is a fact that the Karguzar and Deputy Governor have telegraphed as above, their object in doing so is probably as much to try and discredit the Yamin, who is &amp; persona grata with neither of them, than to serve any other purpose, for they must know well that the demarcated line has already been approved in high places.

The Governor of Lash Juwain has also received orders to assist tiie Mission in every thing. This was unnecessary, as Madat Khan has been, for some time past, most cordially friendly and anxious to assist. He expresses surprise at our being so independent of assistance, for we are of course quite independent of local supplies, and never want anything but fodder. Captains Ramsay and Macpherson, who have been for a flying trip to see the boundary line up to Siah Koh, returned this afternoon. ******** VUh January 1905, Camp Mouth of Farr ah Bud. —The herds of cattle in the Naizar and Hamun area have been spoiling the appearance of our boundary pillars. They have found them splendid places for rubbing them selves against, and assemble at the pillars daily for that purpose, with disastrous results to the plaster and appearance of the pillars. Mr. Ward has now erected strong timber fences round them. I fear these won’t last long^ ******** 16th January 1905. —The Mission marched to-day to the south of the Hamun, 22 miles, to Sheikh Waisi. I was very loth to quit the Earrah Rud until all our agreement maps and papers were finished; but I hesitated to delay longer, as the inundated area is now spreading with the winter rise of the Helmand. The Earrah Rud Camp has been the pleasantest place to stay in we have met in this country. While there, our camels have thrown off much of the sickness they have hitherto suffered from. This goes far to confirm what the Afghans have always told us, i, 6., that Seistani sickness is almost entirely confined to one area. Horses and camels north of the Hamun, and as far east as Kadda (near Chakansur), and again those from Kila Eath, southwards, do not suffer from it. ****** * Enclosure No. 6 .

The fords at Sheikh Waisi have a soft bottom which wears dangerously deep with traffic, so we marched up the right hank of the Pariun, and crossed at our old ford of last March opposite Gurg Ali, where we had no trouble. Saw great numbers of duck and snipe which the severe weather of the past week has driven into sheltered 'waters. 27th January 1905. —Another blizzard eolnmenced suddenly last night, and raged all night with biting cold. It began to snow hard towards morning and, at daybreak, -when we should have started striking camp, it was impos sible to leave shelter. Most of the camp had a rough night, as the blizzard blew the snow in the tents, and many had snow drifts piled on their beds. To stay here until the snow thawed and made the surrounding country one vast morass, would mean several days’ delay, so, as soon as the sun was well up, we struck camp and started our march regardless of the blizzard. Fortu nately the snow ceased at the same time. Towards the last portion of our march to Zahidan, the snow began to thaw, but not sufficiently to impede the camels. We pitched camp at Zahidan on soft ground covered with half melted snow, a most dismal combination. I had felt some anxiety about the men of our advance camp, who, as usual, started early last night and before the blizzard commenced. Zahidan safely. They had a very bad time all night, but got into28th January 1905.—It froze hard again steadily since yesterday evening, the temperature dropping to 10° Fahr. We made a cold march to Kohak. The snow was freezing and dry, and the transport animals had no difficulty in marching. The sheets of ice we saw along the road made one regret the absence uf skates. On arrival at the Bud-i-Seistan, we found that the river had come down in flood during the night and was flowing very de( j p and strong. I had had large tutins made ready for such an emergency, and by evening almost the whole Camp had crossed with their baggage and taken up our old quarters on the Dasht. Only the godown stores and survey camp were left on the other bank to come over to-morrow. The horses were swam over without accidents. All our camp men and animals are now so well accustomed to water work of all sorts that the crossing of a heavy river proceeds like clockwork, and is carried out in quarter of the time and with only a fraction of the danger of our cross ings in earlier and less experienced days. The had weather of the past week has affected our post. None received yesterday or to-day. 29th January 1905, Camp Twenty-four degrees of frost last night (S° Eahr.) and very cold all day. The remainder of our camp and stores crossed safely to-day. Our camp seem all pleased at getting back to their huts and mud shanties. Even to those of us who have not built houses, the change from the damp soil we have been living on so long to this dry gravel is a very pleasant change, and the cold does not strike up through one’s feet like it has hitherto done elsewhere. It is a great relief to all to have finished messing about in water, at any rate for the time being. The camels have not, however, quite done with water yet. It is impossible to get them across here, and they are going down the Rud-i-Seistan and over the Burj-i-Sarband ford, if still practicable, and, if not, round by the Jaginak or some other ford lower down, where the river spreads and shallows. 30th January 1905, Camp Kohak.—Twenty degrees of frost last night, but luckily the wind has gone down. 31st January 1905, Camp Eighteen degrees of frost last night. Our camels have got safely across the Burj-i-Sarband ford just in time, as the river is rising rapidly to-day, and will doubtless continue to do so. I am very glad we have got across the Pariun and out of the inundated areas in good time this year. ****** The final maps and other documents relating to the Seistan boundary settlement, necessary for delivery to the Governments concerned, were duly completed to-day. *They entailed much labour in preparation, and very careful and repeated checking. I will duly deliver them to the Persian and Afghan representatives when I have collected those worthies. The Yamin-i-Nizam is at present in the city on a visit to the Mustansar-ul-Mulk, while the Akhundzada and Musa Khan of Herat are at Nad Ali, awaiting a message from me asking them to rejoin me. A few days’ formal discussion, should either party desire it, may be neces sary about the Seistan water question, to prevent either side hereafter raising objections, on the ground that they were not given an opportunity of duly expounding their case. I do not, however, see much chance of this. Several times during the past two years when the Persian Commissioner tried to insist upon my discussing water questions, I declined to do so at the time ; but expressed willingness to receive a written statement embodying the Persian view of the water question, wfliich w r ould be duly considered hereafter. He has often promised me this, but never produced it. I wrote formally demanding it some three w^eks ago, whereupon the Yamin sent me the required statement. It is very brief, and is to the effect that the Afghans should not be allowed to interfere with the natural flow of the river or make any bunds between Rudbar and Kohak, that neither side should be allowed to make bunds between Kohak and the Pariun, and that the Pariun (Shah Gul) bund should be made by both sides jointly under the supervision of the water Inspector (Persian) of Miansides know that we have been studying the water question ever since our arrival here, and there is very little need for verbal discussion. A few days’ talking, however, is necessary in any case to bring each side the other none. The past week as above reported has, in the matter of cold and bad weather,, been one of very great severity. I am glad to say it has not affected the health of the camp, and there have been no casualties, such as occurred during similar weather in January and February 1903. Enclosure No. 9.

These tracts include some which are in reality inside the Persian boundary, and others which are far inside Afghanistan and have never come into question, such as the Harut Bud, Sar-o-Tar, and the Gaud-i-Zirreh, &amp;c.

From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, Seistan, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Seistan water question. Doubt has recently been weighing on my mind whether following point has been fully considered and decided by Government of India. Please see paragraph 85 of my memorandum of 25th September. My award B, as now agreed upon, provides only for irrigation of Persian land irrigable from and below Band-i-Kohak (vide paragraph 77 of my memo randum and clause 2 of award), i. e., for irrigation of existing Persian cultivation and extension thereof. This has no connection with Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts (vide paragraphs 78 and 79 of my memorandum), the latter of which does not come under the head of existing cultivation and extension thereof.12 Has Goyernment definitely decided that under no future circumstances will Persia be allowed water for irrigation of Hauzdar tract, even if such be found by Afghans reopening Tarakun canal system ? Persia will ^ be certain to raise this question when my award is delivered, and therefore it is well to consider it now. Unless something to the contrary is placed on record in a letter to the Amir, Afghans will be justified in contending hereafter that the present award precludes any further reopening of water question. I cannot help thinking that Government, although desirous to avoid giving Persia any reason for thinking she has a voice in the river above Kohak, yet would be willing, hereafter, when the time came, to consider Persian right to one-sixth of water which has been allowed for Hauzdar tract in my memorandum, and wider awards C and D. If this supposition is correct, will it not he necessary, when communicating award to Amir, for Government to inform him that the award, though referring only to Persian lands irrigable from and below Band-i-Kohak, does not preclude the consideration of Persian right to water for Hauzdar lands, should their irrigation hereafter come within the scope of practical politics ? It would remove all reasonable ground for Persian appeal, if some assurance to that effect could he given to Persian Government at the same time. If thought preferable, Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs, as confirm ing authority in this arbitration, might perhaps add a ruling to above effect. I venture to bring this point to notice, in case it may have been partially overlooked in the general consideration of this complicated question. Enclosure No. 16.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit the following report on the final settlement and demarcation of the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan. 2. My previous reports during the past two years have dealt in detail with the various phases of this question during its earlier and intermediate stages. It only now remains to review as briefly as possible the history of the whole case. In doing so I will endeavour to explain more fully than I have hitherto done the reasons which led to the determination of the boundary line laid down in my award. The manner in which that line has now been demarcated will also be described in detail in this report and its appendices. 3. The water disputes between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan form a separate subject and are not dealt with in this report although they may occasionally be referred to. 4. A few words are necessary to explain the history of the boundary History of the Sfistan boundary question question subsequent to Sir Frederick subsequent to Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s settlement Goldsmid S Settlement in 1872. The and up to the arrival of tbs Mission. conflicting claims of Persia and Afghan istan at that period are already known to Government and need not be repeated here. 5. Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award defined the boundary as follows :— “ (1) She (Persia) should not possess land on the right bank of the Helmund * * * * # Tim main bed of the Helmund, therefore, below Kuhak, should be the Eastern boundary of Seistan. “ (2) And the line of frontier to the hills south of the Seistan desert should be so drawn as to include within the Afghan limits all cultivation on both banks of the river from the bund upwards. The Malik Siah Koh on the chain of hills separating the Seistan from the Kerman desert appears a fitting point. “ (3) North of Seistan the southern limit of the Naizar should be the frontier towards Lash Juwain. Persia should not cross the Hamun in that direction. A line drawn from the Naizar to the Koh Siah hill near Bandan would clearly define her possession.” * * * * 6 . “ A map illustrating the country awarded by the arbitral opinion ” was delivered with the above award by Sir Frederick Goldsmid. It should be carefully noted that no reference is made to this map in the award as being authoritative as regards the boundary line. This map was made by Major (now General) Beresford Lovett, R.E., under circumstances of peculiar difficulty. The movements of the Goldsmid Mission were hampered by Persian officials and they were even refused admittance into several villages in Seistan. To such an extent were their attempts to obtain a proper knowledge of the country frustrated that Generals Goldsmid and Pollock agreed that “ all hope of fair enquiry was vain and the sooner they left Seistan the better.” General Beresford Lovett has himself informed me that his map in no way pretended to be an accurate one, but was merely a sketch map prepared cMefly from, native information. Various important points on the boundary line were never visited at all, notably Koh-i-Malik Siahi and Siah Koh. General Beresford Lovett never visited the point where the line left the Eelmund northwards, nor, he said, was that point ever definitely determined. That portion of the map was, he further said, drawn by him from what he could see* , trnm a distance at Clialcansur. The line marking the boundary of the COOTtry J 0Ter drawn at Tehran some months after General r n m blS idTrft Seistan and was drawn from memory of a country which they had ? 0 Jd Sm .!f very imnerf'ect opportunities of thoroughly learning. It is necessary to lav^ stress^on the above facts regarding the award map, as the map itself lyfan important part in the subsequent disputes about the boundary. P 7 Both countries appealed against the award. Afghanistan objected on 7 - Eo ,, ® '' ;ds th at no portion of so-ealled Persian Seistan should have beeu 8 gTyen toPersia.

Ihe district in question is situated near a place named Ramrud in Major Lovett’s map, and it is described to have been the most fertile part of Seistan in former times.” In her formal appeal Persia claimed that Seistan could not live with out command of the Helmund as far as Rudbar, and she claimed, therefore, the Helmund up to Rudbar, and in the north, the Naizar. 8 Sir Prederick Goldsmid’s award was confirmed by His Majesty s Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 7th March 1873, and hrs decision was formally accepted by the Persian and Afghan Governments in July 1873. 9 In 1874 the Persian Government again raised the Seistan boundary ouestion hv asking for a rectification thereof. They contended that the pasture lands of Takht-i-Shah on which the people of the Jelalabad district of Serstan depended were by Goldsmid’s award included in Afghanistan. They urged that the boundary should be so rectified as to include the Naizar and lakht-r- Shah in Persia. The British Government, however, declined to reopen the question. # In 1881 Persia again brought up the case of Takht-i-Shah and the Naizar, and while admitting these lands to be in Afghan territory, offered to acquire them by purchase or exchange of lands. Nothing more was done in the matter. 1(X The above shows the view taken by the Persian Government of the Goldsmid award and their understanding of the course followed by the boun dary line. I will show later on that, owing to ignorance of the country, their understanding of the course of the boundary line v\as in some respects incorrect. 11. It is necessary now to turn to Sir Prederick Goldsmid’s own views concerning the boundary line defined in his award. Regarding the line from Kuhak southwards he says (vid€ Memorandum, dated 18th July 1873, addiessed to the India Office) * * * * * * “It Mas necessary to draw a line some where to ensure a settlement; and it was simply impossible to find that line as geographically correct as politically expedient. I therefore took an observed object to the southward from the Engineer (Koh-i-Mahk Siah.) Officer’s note book and from the bund a. H. McMahon. ^ j£ u bak, which I had determined to make the point of departure from the river, I drew a line to that point. Of course that line may be insisted on in its geographical integrity as may each of the other lines drawn in the map, I would, however, most respectfully submit my view that, both in expediency and the spirit of arbitration, the bond Jide understanding should he that both banks of the Helmund south ofKuhak rcnaain in tb.G hands of the Afghans, but that the line drawn from the Kuhak bund to the Malik Slab Koh, being merely an arbitrary line run through a desert country, virtually renders the whole waste west of the river cultivation the actual intervening boundary; consequently, that, in the interests of peace and a settled frontier, the Afghans should prevent their own people and the Baluchees from encroaching to the west of the cultivation, and the Persians in like manner should leave the Helmund cultivation south of Kuhak undisturbed. ***** The Kuhak bund remains in the hands of the Persians, so also naturally the heads ot canals close to that bund leading into and irrigating Persian Seistan, hut they should keep no soldiers to protect the dam on the right bank of the river except under agreement with the Afghans. 12. Regarding the line from the Helmund northwards, Sir Frederick Goldsmid wrote in a minute to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs {vide pages 80 and 81 of Mr. Plowden’s Precis of 1879) as follows :— «It, would certainly not be contrary to the spirit of the arbitration ^ to allow Persia the benefit of any reeds or cultivation within the Naizar which fairly belong to the places assigned to her such as Jelalabad, Jehanabad, etc., provided they do not equally belong to places north of the Naizar and on the western side of the Hamun. Therefore, if there be no counter-claim in this respect, I think this point might be conceded. But under no circumstances should the line of the Naizar be transgressed, as all territory to its north must be held to belong to Lash Juwain. ” With regard to Takht-i-Shah Sir Frederick Goldsmid said he did not know where it was. 13. Althoueh the Seistan boundary formed the subject of lengthy corre spondence and discussion between the British, Persian, Afghan and Indian Governments, it is somewhat curious to find that no definite or detailed infor mation as to the course of the boundary line appears ever to have been given by the Persian or Afghan Governments to the people most concerned in the question, i.e., the inhabitants of Seistan themselves. The general terms of the award became known by the withdrawal of Persian garrisons from places east of the Helmund, and it was generally understood that from Kuhak northwards the Helmund formed the boundary. The Helmund river then ran in one main channel past Nad Ali and along what is now the Sikhsar channel into the A’aizar. From careful enquiries and investigations made by this Mission, it appears evident that at that time the Naizar°was reached at a point about 2 or 3 miles north of the present Deh Gul Shah, and the main channel of the Helmund flowed through the Naizar and past the hillocks or tappas of Tilai, Shahraki, and Kurki, thence turning westwards north of Takht-i-Shah. The point where the Naizar verged into Hamun depended, as now, on the varying annual volume and size of the Hamun. 14. The local inhabitants of both Persian and Afghan Seistan seemed to have mutually understood that this main channel bed, both before and after it passed through the Naizar, was their boundary, and we find that under the name of “ Sim ” (boundary) this boundary has been observed by both sides ever since 1872 until two or three years ago. No one appears up to that time to have ever troubled themselves about where the boundary entered the Naizar or where the straight line (if indeed they had ever heard of it) to Siah Koh left the Helmund. Takht-i-Shah, as has been clearly proved by our lines of levels, and as can still be seen by the evidence of old tamarisk jungle, was at the time of Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award not in the Naizar, but on a well defined spit of main land jutting out northwards into the Naizar. While the Persian Government discussed the ownership of it, Persian Seistanis were inoccupation of it and have remained so uninterruptedly ever since. 15. At the time of the Goldsmid award the Helmund, as above stated, flowed in one main channel northwards past Nad Ali. This caused heavy annual inundations along its course, and in consequence the main area ofNaizar and Hamun was then at its mouth. As has been described in fuller detail in my memorandum on the water question, the river began to show an increasing tendency to discharge its volume westwards by channels into te Ashkin lands. This by decreasing the inundation on the northern portion of the Mian Kangi and Kila Kang tracts enabled new cultivation to be widely extended in that direction. A big flood in 1884 still further opened out channels discharging westwards and finally in the flood of 1896 the Helmund burst into a new main channel now known as the Rud-i-Parian. The old main channel past Nad Ali was reduced thereby to a stream of very moderate yolome whic , after feeding the irrigation canals along its course, reached the Sikhsar channel with only a small trickle of water. As the Hamun at the mouth of the old main channel of the Helmund ceased to be fed, its area decreased and the Naizar on its southern edge dried up. Cultivation extended all over Mian Kangi and into Takht-i-Shah. 16. The “ Sim,” i.e., the Sikhsar, although now no longer a flowing stream beyond Deh Gul Shah, still continued to be recognized as the boundary, and it is very probable that, if left alone, no serious disputes regarding that line would ever have arisen between the Persians and Afghans up to the present time. Unfortunately, outside influences began to extend to Seistan, and a Russian Consul arrived on the scene determined, it would appear, to seize any ? opportunity of creating mischief between Persians and Afghans, and turning it to Russian advantage. Thus we find that petty differences regarding 1 boundary and water, which under other circumstances would have been settled like many others in the past amicably by the Persian and Afghan Governors, began to assume a magnitude out of all proportion to their real importance. 17. The extension, in 1901, of the Takht-i-Shah canals by the Persians into the old dry Naizar near Tappa-i-Kaniz may be said to mark the commencement of the series of disputes which under Russian^ instigation led to the present arbitration. In itself this was not an infringement of the boundary line as mutually recognized by the local inhabitants of Persian and Afghan Seistan, but the subsequent cultivation of new lands near Ganguzar on the east of the “ Sim ” was undoubtedly a transgression of that boundary. The Afghans retaliated by closing the small Sikhsar channel close to Deh Gul Shah and turning off the whole of the little water that reached that point into a new canal which led off to the west to irrigate some lands west of the “ Sim.” The Afghans announced their intention of extending this canal northwards to Padai, The Persians prepared to resist this encroachment by force. Both sides assembled their local forces and a collision might have occurred unless the British Consul (Major Chenevix Trench) had persuaded the Governor of Chakansur to desist from further extension of his canal. The Governor of Chakansur tried to defend his action by claiming that the real boundary was the Shela-i-Shamshiri, it being the real old main bed of the Helmund. So it was, but at a period previous to the Goldsmid Mission. I may remark here that he has since admitted to me that this claim was not a genuine one, and unless Russian influences had been brought to bear, this dispute like others would have been amicably settled. As it was, the matter was reported in exaggerated strains to Tehran, and a Persian Commissioner, the Yamiu-i-Nizam, was sent to Seistan to settle boundary disputes with an Afghan Commissioner, one Musa Khan of Herat, sent to Seistan by the Amir. 18. The Afghan Commissioner made fruitless attempts to arrange a meet ing with his Persian colleague but without success, and as many months passed without their meeting the Governor of Chakansur brought matters to a climax by occupying Deh Dost Muhammad, an important Persian village in Mian Kangi on the 6th July 1902. Both the Persians and Afghans concerned have informed me that at this stage every endeavour was made by the Russian Consul to incite both sides into active hostility, with the obvious intention of being himself called upon to intervene. The energetic action of the British Consul (Major Benn) in arranging a temporary settlement with the Afghansfortunately prevented further mischief. An abnormally low river that same summer led to a further serious misunderstanding on water questions which have been fully described in my memorandum on the water question. Eola tions between the Persians and Afghans became very strained. 19. The Persian Government became alarmed and under the terms of article 6 of the Treaty of 1857 called upon the British to intervene. It is unnecessary to repeat here the details of Appeal to British Arbitration. ^ ne g otiaj . ;oI19 between the British, Persian and Afghan Governments on this point. Suffice it to say that arbitra tion was accepted by both the Persian and Afghan Governments on the under standing that the final decision on appeal, if any, should rest with His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. No sooner was this settled than the Persian Government, under Russian advice (which is explained by the Russian failure to obtain representation, either direct or indirect, on this Mission), began to try and get out of arbitra tion, but they finally accepted it on the understanding that both the arbitral award and the Secretary of State’s decision thereon should be in accordance with the terms of Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award of 1872. ( F letter, dated 2nd November 1902, from the Persian Foreign Minister, to the British Legation, Teheran.) 20. On the arrival of this Arbitration Mission in Seistan in February 1903, further attempts were made to stultify its action and defeat its purpose. The Persian Commissioners * were in formed by their Government that our arbitration applied only to water questions. Their instructions were thus worded “ Keep this point in view that the bound aries of Seistan and Baluchistan have been already entirely delimited. Now in Seistan this Mission is for the removal of differences t in respect to Helmund water * • * * and nothing else.” (Vide enclosure to my letter No. 503 of 25th February 1903 to the Government of India.) 21. Although the Persian Commissioners were not then authorized to discuss boundary questions, I insisted upon obtaining their views on the subject. I even made them accompany me along the disputed boundary from Deb Dost Muhammad to Takht-i-Shah in March 1903, but they declined to accompany me round the northern portion to Siah Koh, when I went there in May o that year. 22. The boundaries claimed by the Persians and Afghans respectively were as follows. Briefly stated, the Persians Boundary claimed by Persia. contended that Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award map was no authority, and they even denied ever haying seen a copy thereof. They claimed that the boundary as defined in his award ran as follows *.—From the Koh-i-Malik Siah it ran, not in a straight line to Kuhak, but in such a manner as to include in Persian territory the ara un tract and all the country on the west of the Helmund, leaving on y esma narrow fringe of present Afghan cultivation on the left bank °f that river Afghan territory. From Kuhak it followed the Helmund and the Nad All Sikhsar channel, and thence northwards through the old Naizar to the nor ern edge of the Hamun, and thence in a straight line to Siah Koh. ? 23. The Afghan claims are defined in detail in His Highness the 8 . letter of October 15th and December 9th, Boundary clarmed by Afghanistan. ^ ^ Governm e n t of India. They represent merely an attempt to verbally define the line shown on Goldsmid s award map, which is taken as the sole authority on the subject regardless o any written award. As a matter of fact I have ascertained that the A g an Government does not possess any copy of Sir Frederick Goldsmid s awar , as all papers connected with the Goldsmid Mission appear to have got lost in ie chaos which ensued on the death of Amir Sher Ali. 5560 F.

(The Afghan Commissioner * claimed possession also of Hauzdar and Knntdar.) Prom Band-i-Kuhak their line followed the Helmund and Nad Ali chan nel to a point ahont one and-a-half miles from Nad Ali near Burj-i-As and Deh Ido. It was contended that this is the point at which, on Sir Frederick GoldsmhPs map, the boundary line leaves the river and that therefore the Afghan boundary should run from here in a straight line to Siah Koh. * The Afghan Commissioner was Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad Khan, Governor of Chakansur. Associated with him as such was Musa Khan of Herat. A. H. McMahon. 24. So much for the rival claims. It will be seen that the Persians based theirs on their own interpretation of the Goldsmid award and professed igno rance of his map, while the Afghans had never seen the award and insisted on a strict adherence to the map. 25. The first thing to be done by this Mission was to make an accurate survey of the country. Even the latest Accurst, new .urvey of Se.etan earned out. Government of India maps were found to be very inaccurate, a fact which is easily explained when one realises the very serious difficulties which this country offers to accurate survey work owing to its dead flatness and general absence of prominent points, together with, in some places, dense tamarisk jungle, wide stretches of water and high reeds, and in others vast expanses of waterless desert. It was only with great effort and after a considerable time with our large staff of able surveyors that these diffi culties were overcome and accurate maps on scales of 4 miles and 1 mile=l inch were prepared. It was hardly surprising, therefore, to find that the country as shown by our maps differed largely from that shown in earlier maps prepared under less favourable circumstances, and especially from that shown in the Goldsmid map. It is a matter of much greater surprise that the map made under such very unfavourable circumstances by Major Beresford Lovett in 1872 is so approximately accurate as it is. 26. The next step after completing a new survey of the country was to determine with its aid the course of the o f ttllTHr.f a ™Srp M ' 8aefi “ ,ti0D boundary line as defined in the Goldsmid award. Having established the fact that the Helmund at the time of that award ran along the present Nad Ali and Sikhsar Channels, the boundary presented little difficulty up to the point where it is said by Sir F. Goldsmid to enter the Naizar. Local evidence and the unerring proofs afforded by surveys and levels established the fact that, at the time of the Goldsmid Mission, the point where the Helmund entered the Naizar is at the edge of the tract of mainland just north of Deh Ali Jangi and Ganguzar. The limits of the old Naizar can be still distinguished by the dry stumps of reed roots and the absence of ■f New tamarisk jungle is rapidly growing up in the old Naizar, and I notice a great difference in the aspect of the country during the last two years. It is becoming increasingly difficult to trace the old Naizar in places. A. H. McMahon. old f tamarisk jungle which covers the mainland. From just west of this point the mainland jutted out northwards into the Naizar in a long narrow spit on which the Deh Buzi and Takht-i-Shah villages are now situated, and which terminates at a point known as Shalghami. The Afghan Commissioner has himself admitted that this spit was dry mainland and not Naizar at the time of the Goldsmid Mission. Applying Sir F. Goldmid’s definition to the actual conditions of the country, the boundary line of his award ran along the eastern edge of this spit to Shalghami, thus leaving Takht-i-Shah in Persia. 27. From this point onwards the definition becomes very difficult of application. As shown by their own accounts of their journey to Lash Juwain, e Naizar even at the time of the Goldsmid Mission stretched practically across the whole of that portion of the Hamun tract between Seistan and the mam and of Lash Juwain. There was a larger area of Hamun to the north east t an now exists since the Helmund has turned westwards, but then, as now, the Naizar stretched in places from the southern to the northern shore an on y m years of high flood is there any wide stretch of open water to whichthe name of Hamun as distinetf from Naizar can be applied between the Hamun-i-Puza and the Bamun-i*Sabari; the Hamun area shown in our recent survey map is the area covered by water in years of high flood. Even at the time of the Goldsmid Mission it would have been impossible to lay down a boundary line from any point on the north bank of the Seistan mainland to Siah Koh in strict accordance with Sir E. Goldsmid’s definition. The principle underlying his definition is that the boundary line should not enter the mainland north of the Hamun, which belongs to the Lash Juwain district of Afghanistan. A straight line from Shalghami to the Nar-i-Ahu peak fulfils this con dition. * It must be remembered that the water in tbe Naizar is often of considerable depth, i.e., as much as 6 or 7 feet. The only essential condi tions apparently required for the growth of the reed beds which constitute Naizar, and which distinguish Naizar fron actual Hamun and other areas included in the general term Hamun, are that a tract should be under water of moder ate depth for considerable periods and should occasionally be dry, or nearly dry so as to admit of reproduction of reeds, but should never dry up for too long a period. A. II. McMahon. 28. The next difficulty was to determine the identity of the Siah Koh (Black hill) near Bandan referred to in the Goldsmid award. It was not visited by that Mission and the name was taken from people at a distance who probably knew as little of the names of the distant hills as their present suc cessors. It is obvious, however, that a group of conspicuous black hills which stand out prominently near Bandan as seen from Seistan and Lash Juwain was the Siah Koh meant by Sir E. Goldsmid. The position in his map ascribed to this group confirms this. None of these mountains, however, are locally known as Siah Koh. The three mountains composing tbe above group are called Nar Abu, Mada Ahu, and Sabzak, respectively, of which Nar Ahu is the most southern and Sabzak the most northern of the group. That this group was understood by the Persians to be the Siah Koh of the Goldsmid award is proved by an old Persian map which is in my possession. On it is a note by Mir Alam Khan, the then Governor of Seistan, to the effect that “ Siah Koh is also called Nar Ahu Mada Ahu. n It only remained to decide which of the three peaks best fulfils the Goldsmid definition. To Nar Ahu only of the three can a straight line be drawn from Shalghami without cutting the mainland north of the Bamun. Nar Ahu must, therefore, be taken to be the Siah Koh. 29. Having thus applied the boundary line defined by Sir E. Goldsmid to Present conditions of existing Persian and the existing^ country, it W3S necessary to Afghan occnpation and possession of tracts adjoin- next ascertain the conditions of actual ing tbe boundary ime. present occupation and possession by Persia and Afghanistan of the country adjoining that line, and consider whether any modification of that line was necessary to suit present condi tions. It has already been explained in paragraphs 14 and 15 above how, in the absence of detailed information of the Goldsmid award, the people of Persian and Afghan Seistan had arrived at a mutual understanding regarding the boundary. The line recognized by them only differed from the actual line defined in the Goldsmid award from the point where the old Helmund entered the Naizar northwards. It thence ran along the old dry bed of the Sikhsar through the Naizar northwards and thence westwards north of Shalghami to Mesh Kushi. Erom there nobody apparently has ever bothered their heads about boundaries. The line was vaguely understood to run in a straight line to Tappa-i-Kharan, and thence westwards. How or where it ran from Tappa- i-Kharan no one has ever seemed to know or care. This is hardly surprising when one considers that the tract in question is nothing but Naizar, saline flats, marsh or Hamun until the barren waterless slopes of the mountains are reached. The desolate, waterless, saline flats studded with old ruins, which form the southern portion of the Lash Juwain district, moreover, offer no attractions to the people of that district, and they have always remained supremely indifferent about their southern boundary. 30. Both sides seem to have respected their mutually recognized boundary until the last few years, when the encroachments described in paragraph 17 above were made.The Goldsmid line described in paragraphs 26, 27, and 28 above represents the boundary of actual present occupation except in the following cases (1) A small tract included by the Afghan canal west of the Sikhsar between Deh Gul Shah and Deh Hassan Kharot. (2) A small tract of Persian cultivation east of the Sikbsar at Ganguzar. In the winter of 1903-1904 the Persians further encroached in this direction by occupying the lands of Deh Ali Jangi. (3) The Persian cultivation and village at Tappa-i-Kaniz. This, it should be noted, is on the Persian side of the mutually recognized boundary, although east of the Goldsmid line as defined in para graph 26 above. Further north and west the vague ideas held of the boundary line by the Persian Seistanis and the apathy of the Lash Juwain people have resulted in the Persian cattle-owners grazing their herds and residing for portions of the year without let or hindrance as far north as the Parrah Rud, while Persian tax-collectors have often collected grazing tax and taken fees from kafilas without objection being made as far north inside the Lash Juwain mainland as Peshawaran and Salian. 31. With the above information at my disposal it only remained to adapt the line of the Goldsmid award to present Interpretation of the Goldsmid line to meet conditions. I considered that it was of existing conditions. . . , n , primary importance tor many reasons to reduce to a minimum any disturbance of existing conditions of occupation and v possession. The circumstances of the case did not seem to call for changes, and I considered that arbitrary changes, however pleasing they might appear at first sight to one or other side, would in reality do more harm than good and the ill-feeling stirred up thereby would in the end injure both sides. The explanations given by Sir P. Goldsmid of the principles underlying his award, as stated in paragraph 12 above, gave me, I considered, all the necessary authority for making the slight modifications required in his line while, at the same time, keeping my award within the terms of his award as required by the condition imposed upon me by the Persian Government. Prom the Koh-i-Malik Siah to the Band-i-Kuhak the only satisfactory solution of the boundary question equally fair to both sides was a straight line between these points. A tract of deserted country has formed the boundary up to now; but it is no longer safe to rely upon a boundary so indefinitely defined. I therefore decided to award a straight line. Prom Kuhak to the mouth of the Afghan canal near Deh Gul Shah the line runs along the Helmund river and Nad Ali and Sikhsar channels. Prom that point I decided to award to Afghanistan the lands between their new canal and the old “ Sim ” as far as Deh Hassan Kharot, as a fair set off to the Persian encroachment at Tappa-i-Kaniz. The Persian encroachments at Gan guzar and Deh Ali Jangi could not be supported on any grounds, so I decided to restore those lands to Afghanistan. I would have liked, with the above exception, to retain as the boundary the old bed of the Sikhsar northwards which had for so long been recognized as such, but this is now only a small dry ditch about 2 feet wide and a few inches deep, in places no larger than a shallow furrow. It is very difficult to distinguish its course, and a careless ploughman might any day obliterate it for ever. To demarcate its course meant building pillars for a long dis tance through marsh lands subject to heavy inundation. I therefore decided to take advantage of a line of prominent and conveniently situated tappas or mounds called Tappa-i-tilai, Tappa-i-Shahraki, and Tappa-i-Kurki and run the boundary by straight lines at long them to Shalghami. This line very closely follows the course of the old “ Sim. ” j j Prom Shalghami to Siah Koh I saw no reason to depart from a straight line for the boundary, and, for reasons stated in paragraph 28, the Nar Ahu was fixed upon as the Siah Koh. m i l 36 no ^ ce ^ that this line fails to include, in Afghanistan, lakht-i-Shah which the Persian Government in 1873 and 1874 understood to be Reasons for leaving Takht-i-Shah in Persia. outside the Persian boundary. I have explained in paragraph 26 how the PersianGoyernment were mistakGu in this idea. This place lies on the Peisian side of the line as defined by Sir F. Goldsmid. My reason for now referring to this spot again in some detail is because regarding no place along the whole Seistan boundary has so much misunderstanding and discussion arisen. ^ This is the more extraordinary, as it is about the most miserable spot in Seistan. It consists of a few patches of poor eulturable land in the midst of sand hills fringed on either side by a dismal waste of marsh and salt flats, Impoitance has been attached to this place by the Afghans owing to its having been specifically alluded to in correspondence between the other Governments con cerned in the Seistan Settlement. The Afghan Commissioner made strenuous efforts to obtain its inclusion in Afghan territory, as he feared the Amir s wrath if he failed to do so. It was easy to see that he did not himself believe that the Afghans had any real right to it. To include it in Afghan territory, even if this could have been done in accordance with the Goldsmid award, would have brought about a most undesirable state of affairs. It has always been in Persian possession, it is within a short distance of several Persian villages and is irrigable from Persian canals, whereas it is cut off for the greater portion of the year from the Afghan mainland by marsh and water. While this Mission were camped there, the Afghan Commissioner could only reach us by travelling several miles tnrough Persian territory. The nearest inhabited spot of Afghan^ territory was some miles distant, and he urged me to leave the place as it gave him so much trouble to keep in touch with me while there! It cannot be irrigated rom any Afghan canal system, and would, therefore, be useless to the Afghans. It would form an isolated island, so to speak,^ of Afghan territory thrust m o Persian Seistan, and, as such, would not fail to be a constant source of inconvenience, trouble, and irritation to the Persians. To prove the trouble it would cause, I need only quote the Afghan Commissioner s reply to my query as to what use Afghanistan would make of this worthless spot if they got it. “Oh,” said he, “we would put an Afghan post there and at Tappa-i-Kaniz just to annoy the Persians.” Further comment appears unnecessary. 33. Enough has been said above to fully explain the line I determined to award and the reasons which influenced me in so doing. My decision was arrived at by May 1903 and under ordi- Reasons for delay in delivery of Boundary j^ry circumstances I would have delivered award - forthwith an arbitral award accordingly, but the circumstances of the case were very far from ordinary, and I con sidered it wiser for the following reasons to defer the delivery of my award and take action on other and somewhat unusual lines. The Persian Government still contended that no boundary questions were in dispute and that the scope of my arbitration extended only to the settlement of Seistan water questions. To such lengths did they go in this direction that they actually demanded from me, through the British Legation in leheran, an explanation as to why I visited the Siah Koh ! It would appear that the reason of this unreasonable attitude was that the Russians had frightened them into believing that our arbitration would result in a large portion of Persian Seistan being given to the Afghans. Until the Persians consented to recognize the very obvious fact that boundary questions were in dispute, it seemed premature to fire off a boundary award, and, moreover, I was obliged to look beyond my arbitral award and keep in view the fact that the boundary line itself had subsequently to be demarcated on the ground. This would not be possible until the award was accepted and approved of by both the countries concerned. 34. No further progress was made until June 14th, 1903, when a very opportune fracas occurred between Afghans and Persians over the disputed lands on the frontier near Ueh Ali Jungi in which some Afghans were wounded. This gave me the desired opportunity of advancing matters an important step forward and I issued an arbitrary order in the form of an intermediate award laying down the boundary line described in paragraph 31 above from Deh Gul ShalTto Tappa-i-Tilai and called upon both Commissioners to prevent their people transgressing that line.iX v f\ t An interesting corroboration of this view will be found in the Amirs ]et,teJipf 16th March 1904, to the Government of India, to which I invite reference. A. H. McMahon. As this collision and mv action thereon would necessarily prevent the Persian Government contending any longer that there were no boundary , , T disputes, I thought the time had now I90 8 !to^he y SirT drived to communicate full particulars * Hardinge. of the whole boundary question to the a. H. McMahon. British Minister at Teheran and to define, for the information of the Persian Government, the line which I said I proposed, except under certain stated contingencies, to lay down in my arbi tral award. 35. It *may be asked why I did not deliver the whole of my award at this stage. To do so I considered would be playing into Bussian f hands as they would make the Persian^ Government believe they had been hardly dealt with in my award, no matter what its terms really were. An appeal to His Majesty’s Foreign Secretary of State would doubt less have followed and that opened out a vista of interminable discussion and delays, and the ultimate confirmation of my award with the rejection of the Persian appeal would be represented to Persia as a fitting termination to our arbitrary and high-handed proceedings. The Bussians had very favourable ground to work on. They have long ago got the Persians to believe that the Goldsmid award was an act of most cruel injustice to Persia, who had everv right to the whole area of classic Seistan even as far up as Budbar. So much national sentiment attaches to both the legendary and historical past of Seistan that the Persians always find it hard to view Seistan with undistorted perspective and have long nursed imaginary grievances regarding the Gold smid settlement. ' __ * r o e, to ti y and work matters, if possible, so that toe Persian Government should he reduced to accept my award before it was actually delivered. I could not alter it after formally delivering it, whereas the peculiar circumstances of the case enabled me, while laying all possible stress on the points where my proposed interpretation of the Goldsmid award could tie shown to be favourable to Persia, to also hint very plainly that anv reconsideration of the question on wider lines, and in the light of past iniudi- eious admissions and statements of the Persian Government, would result in an interpretation much, less favourable to %rsia, if she did not accept the settlement now proposed. ' A lengthy correspondence ensued and the Persian Government while no longer able to deny that boundary disputes were in question, endeavoured to question the justice of my line and to insist on various conditions relating to tl e Seistan water quesuon being included in my boundary award and coupled with boundary questions. To describe the new positions taken u’n md abandoned by the Persian Government at this period is unnecessary Suffice it to say that nothing seems to have been left undone by Persia’s disinterested Russian advisers to complicate simple questions. disinterested t &gt; 'l'' 1,U1 'p ? t!u . s . sta S e 1 received some valuable assistance from one of the Persian Commissioners, the Yamin-i-Nizam.

On the 1st November the Persian Government agreed to accept my line unconditionally.* * Vide tel'g';vn &lt;.f 1st November 1903 , from satisfactory result having at last Mr. Grant Dull. been achieved and the hands of the Persian Government being thus completely tied in the matter of any appeal, I proceeded to formally deliver my award. It was delivered to the Afghan Commissioner on the 8th November and to the Persian Commissioner on the 11th November 1903. The text of the award as delivered was communicated to the Government of India and Teheran in my letter No. 1259 of 14th November 1903 It is necessary to note here that, although the terms of my proposed award had long ago been communicated to the Persians, the Afghans had until now remained in ignorance of them. This was necessary as long as there was any chance of my being obliged to modify my award in consequence of the contingencies referred to above. I bad, moreover, steadily endeavoured to minimize any expectations on the part of the Afghans of a line unduly favour ably to themselves, and any misgivings which the protracted period of our dis cussion with the Persian Government had instilled into their minds were allowed to remain there. The result was as intended and hoped for, i.c., that when the time came to enlighten them they were very agreeably surprised at the line propounded in my award. The Afghan Commissioner in forwarding it to His Highness the Amir wrote in very favourable terms of it and strongly recommended its acceptance. . , 38 He expressed to me his confidence that the Amir would accept it, but said it wms not improbable that some Delay in acceptance of the award by tbe misfit occur in this as the Persians Afghan Government. ^ s() much delay i n the matter that the Afghan Government might think it unbecoming to their dignity to show undue alacrity in expressing their final approval of the boundary settie- This supposition proved correct. No reply was received from the Amir until early in April 1904 when he informed the Government oi India that he accepted my award. He stated, however, that demarcation was undesirable. His letter (No. 52 of 10th March 1904), to which I invite reference, expresses approval of the boundary settlement and argues that an award on my part more favourable to Afghanistan would have played into the Russian hands. It affords interesting corroboration of the views expressed in paragraph do above. I his connection in the Amir’s mind of Russia with the Se i sta J question, coupled with the annoyance he was then experiencing at their lan s, m e matter of the demarcated ilnsso-Afghan frontier, led him, as stated in Ins letter, to desire that the Seistan line should not be demarcated. 39. Further representations to Kabul by the Government of India resulted at last in a letter (No. 57 of 12th August 1901) from His Highness the Amir agreeing to demarcation. Ibis did not Final acceptance by tbe Afghan Government rea(dl me un til 5th September when I and demarcation of tbe line. informed the Afghan Commissioner of the Amir’s consent. No authority, however, had reached him from Ka,bul and he was naturally afraid to take action without it. I explained that . es ® the Amir considered his communication to the Government of India su men and I had no option hut to act upon it as sufficient authority for demarca ion. In deference to the Afghan Commissioner’s anxiety I decided to nni our work at first to the demarcation of the straight line from Koh-i-Mali ia o Kuhak, and work commenced on the 23rd September. . ^ a The line from Koh-i-Malik Siah to the Band-i-Seistan, running as R does through absolutely waterless desert for some ninety miles, presen e difficulty. All w^ater, both for men and animals and huildmg, ia brought from a distance varying from ten to twenty-five miles, an so ihundred camels were continuously employed on this work. The heat, wind, dust, haze, and mirage interfered greatly with the work of alignment and the straight line from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Kuhak was not finished until November 18th, 1904. The building parties, who worked for over one and-a-half months in the waterless desert, suffered considerable hardships. In the meantime the Afghan Commissioner received, on 30th October, the * a copy Of this letter, which was dated 15th requisite authority from His Highness the October 1904, was forwarded to the Government ^ m i r to assist in demarcation.* This of India with my letter No. 2548, dated 8th , ,, ,. ,, . „ November 1904. letter was the first intimation the Afghan A. h. McMahon. Commissioner had yet received of the Amir’s acceptance of my award. There was a complete absence of any note of disapproval of the boundary settlement in this letter and it caused the Afghan Commissioner the liveliest satisfaction. The details of the demarcation of the boundary line are very fully related elsewhere. It is sufficient to say here that a low Hamun enabled me to demarcate with boundary pillars most of the usually inundated portion of the line between Shalghami and the Siah Koh. The last 25 miles from the western shore of the Hamun to Siah Koh ran through another stretch of absolutely waterless country. The whole line was successfully demarcated up to the Siah Koh by the 29th December 1904. Masonry pillars carefully built, many of them of great size and height, have been built along the line. Every care has been taken to mark clearly with pillars all portions of the line where future doubt might arise and to demarcate the whole line in a manner that is best suited for durability and permanence. The arduous duty of building the pillars, a task which involved careful and extensive arrangements and considerable hardship, was entrusted to Mr. T K J Ward and the thorough manner in which the work has been carried out is deserving of the highest praise. • i 1 *,! 8 n °} to 116 ex P ecte(1 tllat tlle plaster covering of these pillars will Ion' resist the destructive effects of the alternating heat and frost of Seistan, but the loss of the outer skin will have no effect on the durability of the pillars themselves.

This report has, I fear, attained somewhat large proportions, but this has been unavoidable in the case of a Concluding remarks. question which, possessing certain intri- cacies of its own, has by reason of unnecessary complications of an unusual nature taken two years of tedious labour to unravel and settle. It is gratifying in bringing this review of its history and settlement to a close to be able to record the opinions entertained of its settlement by the countries concerned. In the settlement of all boundary questions, more especially where they relate to a country to which sentimental as well as material importance attaches, there is always a grave risk of the discussion re-opening the old sentimental grievances of either side, and of awakening the slumbering ill-feelings of the past, and of the eventual settlement leaving both sides discontented and with ruffled feelings that take s o m ® ^ ime £ calm down. In the present case I am glad to be able to report that no such results have accrued. Both sides, as represented by those most intimately concerned, i.e . 9 the officials and the people of the country itself, appear * genuinely satisfied and pleased with their boundary as now settled and demarcated. It is a boundary line to which, with slight exceptions, they have already been long present the general local feeling on either side. accustomed. The Very slight modification A. H.

Usual ending. Final Arbitral Statement on the Seistan Boundary by Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I. C.I.E, British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, dated 1st February ISOo! 1. The boundary line between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan was defined in my arbitral award of November 1903 as follows “The boundary line in Seistan between Afghanistan on the east and Persia on the west should run as follows, i.e., from the Malik Siah Koh in a straight line to the Band-i-Kuhak and thence along the bed of the Helmund river to^the point of separation* of its two branches, the Bud-i-Parian and Nad Ali channel. Prom there it should follow the bed of the Nad Ali channel into the Sikhsar and along the bed of Sikhsar to a point near Deh Yar Muham mad where the Sikhsar has been diverted towards the west in the water channel shown on the map which joins the Shela-i-Shamshiri near to Deh Hassan Kharot. The boundary line should follow the left bank of this wntor (4) A map on the scale of 1 inch = 1 mile in one sheet, illustrating only that portion of the boundary which lies between the point of separation of the Nad Ali channel and the B-ud-i-Parian from the Helmund and Tappa-i-Tilai. point of separation ”.) an ‘ 1 is “ ow r «? kMd ««re correct term4. The latitude and longitude of this and all other Seistan boundary- pillars, the position of each with regard to prominent places visible from them, and all necessary particulars of their size and construction are fully stated in the list of boundary pillars attached to this statement. The position of each boundary pillar is also clearly shown in the two maps attached to this. 5. From the top of Malik Siah Koh to the Band-i-Kuhak (also called Baad-i-Seistan) the straight line of boundary has been marked by 51 pillars. As these are all in exactly one straight line a further description of each is unnecessary ; and it suffices to say that No. 12 is on the south bank of the Shela, No. 36 on the north hank of the Sana rud, and No. 51 on the left bank of the Helmund river where the Rud-i-Seistan leaves that river at the Band-i- Kuhak. Between pillars Nos. 8 and 9 and between Nos. 12 and 13 are 3 and 8 miles respectively of heavy sand through which it was not possible to demar cate the line with pillars. Besides these 51 pillars there are 16 smaller marks also exactly on the straight line. The positions and particulars of these are stated in the attached list of pillars. They bear the following numbers in that list13A, 14A, 15A, 16A, 17A, 18A, 18B, 180, 21A, 23A, 23B, 25A, 25B, 26A, 32A, 43A, but in order to prevent confusion with boundary pillars they have been shown in the map attached to this only as small black dots without numbers. 6. From the Band-i-Kuhak demarcation with pillars was unnecessary alon^ the course of the Helmund river as far as the point of separation of the Budd-Pariun and Nad Ali branches of that river. To mark this point pillar No. 52 has been built at a distance of 94 feet from the left, i.e., Persian, bank of the Nad Ali channel, and pillar No. 53, has been built at a distance of 65 feet from the right or Afghan bank of the same channel. The boundary line thence follows the Nad Ali channel. The old ruin of Burj-i-As marks the right bank of that channel near Nad Ali, and pillar No. 54 marks the right bank at the point where the Shela-i-Charakh leaves that channel. From pillar No. 54 the Nad Ali channel is known as the Sikhsar. Pillar No. 55 marks the left bank of the Sikhsar at the point where the Deh Dost Muham mad canal takes oft' from it, while pillar No. 56 also marks the left bank at the point where the Sikhsar again turns northwards. Pillar No. 57 has been built on a prominent mound called Tappa-i-Sikhsar which is situated at a distance of 240 feet from the right or Afghan bank of the Sikhsar. Further north, pillar No. 58 which has been built at a distance of 109 feet from the right bank, and pillar No. 59, which is situated 20 feet from^ the left bank of the Sikhsar stream, mark the point where the boundary line leaves the Sikhsar as defined in my award. Pillar No. 58 is built alongside the site o Deh Yar Muhammad. Tnat village mentioned in my award has lately been deserted and no longer exists. , XT , 7. Further demarcation of the course of the Helmund river and the iN an Ali and the Sikhsar streams is at present impossible owing to the nature of the banks, which are liable to be inundated. Moreover further demarcation appears unnecessary at the present time as the course of the water in those streams clearly marks the boundary. Hereafter should any of those streams dry up by reason of a change in the course of the Helmund, and cease to be water channels, their course can easily be ascertained and demarcated, it necessary, with the aid of the pillars and places above described. , , 8 From pillar No. 59 the course of the boundary line is demarcated by pillars Nos. 60 and 61 built on the left bank of the water channel which pins the Shela-i-Shamshiri near Deh Hassan Karot. Pillar No. 62 has been built to mark this point on the south bank of the Shela-i-Shamshin close to Deh Hassan Kharot. From here the straight line to Tappa-i-Tilai has been marked by pillars Nos. 63, 64, and 65, the last named being built on of , la PP a : i-Tilai. It is necessary to note here that the villages of Deh Ah Mardan and Deh Ali Jangi mentioned in my award as being on either side of this line have been deserted since my award was delivered and neither of them now exist. 9. To illustrate the boundary line from the point of separation of the Kud- i-Pariun and Nad Ali channels to Tappa-i-Tilai in greater detail than is possible in a map of 4 miles to 1 inch, a map of 1 mile to 1 inch of that portion of th boundary line is attached to this statement.10. Pillar No. 66 has been built on the top of the most western of the Sharaki Tappas and the straight line onwards to Tappa-i-Kurki is marked by pillars Nos. 67 and 68, the latter being situated on the top of the most western of the Kurki Tappas. On the straight line between pillar No. 68 and Shal- ghami, which is marked by pillar No. 70, pillar No. 69 has been built. The land on which pillars Nos. 67 and 69 have been built is generally under water, but as it happened to be dry at the time of demarcation massive masonry pillars have been built at those points which it is hoped will last a long time. 11. Prom pillar No. 70 at Shalgharni, the straight line of boundary to Siah Koh has been marked by 19 pillars, Nos. 71 to 90. Of these pillars some are built in Naizar lands subject to inundation, and every care has been taken to built them strong and massive enough to last a long time. The line from pillar No. 70 to pillar No. 76 passes 600 feet south of the most southern ed^e of a prominent Tappa called Tappa-i-Kharan, 3,223 feet south of the centre of top of southern face of Tappa-i-Shaghalak, and 1,185 feet south of the highest point of Tappa-i-Musjidak. Between pillars Nos. 76 and 77 the line crosses the open water of the Hamun and demarcation was impossible. Pillar No. 77 is on the west shore of the Hamun, and the line thence ascends the barren and waterless glacis and slopes of the Siah Koh. Pillar No. 90 is on the summit of Siah Koh, which is also known locally as the Nar-i-Ahu. 12. Two maps accompany this statement. One, in two sheets is on a scale of 1 inch = 4 miles and illustrates the whole boundary from Malik Siah Koh to Siah Koh. The other is on a scale of 1 inch = 1 mile, and illustrates the boundary between the point of separation of the Kud-i-Pariun and Nad Ali channels of the Helmund and Tappa-i-Tilai only. It should be noticed that the number of names of villages has been restricted as much as possible in these maps. This is due to the fact that most of the villages in Seistan frequently change not only their names but also their positions. Endeavour has been made to show only such villages as are likely to be permanent. These maps should be considered as superseding those issued with mv award of November 1903. 13. Attached to this statement is a list, already referred to, of all the boundary pillars, giving all necessary particulars of their position, size, con struction, etc. 14. All measurements such as inches, feet, yards, and miles in this state ment and the accompanying list of boundary pillars, are English inches, feet, yards, and miles. A. H.

Except where expressly stated to the contrary, all pillars are plastered and all pillars and cairns are whitewashed and numbered. 2 The 16 subsidiary boundary marks distinguished by letters, such as 13A, 14A, etc., owe their existence to the necessity for disposing of the material of certain pillars which were originally built on an incorrect alignment. To have left the delris of these pillars on the Dasht after their destruction might have led to future misunderstanding, and their sites were therefore carefully cleaned up and the material removed and made into boundary marks on the correct alignment.

From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram No. 789, dated 5th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith a memorandum on the Seistan water question, together with four draft awards thereon, for your consideration. {Secret and Confidential). MEMORANDUM ON THE SEISTxlN WATER QUESTION. 1. The settlement of the water question between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan involves other questions of a purely political nature. Success in the effective carrying out of any arbitral award that may be given on this subject largely depends on the pressure which the Government of India may, from time to time, bring to bear on the Afghan Government, or cause to be brought to bear on the Persian Government, to prevent the terms of that award being ignored by either side. 2. It is, therefore, necessary for the arbitrator to refer the matter to the Government of India, in order that his award may not commit that Govern ment to future responsibilities greater than may seem to them desirable or reasonable. 3. To facilitate a proper understanding of the water problems which now await settlement, I have briefly recapitulated, below, all the salient points^ in the past history of the Helmand river, the disputes which have arisen regarding it, and the results of our local enquiries and observations. 4. I also attach drafts of awards based on conclusions derived from the above In framing them, I have endeavoured, in each, to meet the fair require ments of Persia and Afghanistan, but at the same time to provide variations in the general scope of the award, so as to enable Government to select that which may appear to them the most suitable. g gji r ivers when they reach a delta, the course of the Uelmand, and its branches in Seistan, has been subject w?tlr tO dTsp O itel h 0 c?n 0 n?c?ed therein to considerable changes from earliest from 1872 to 1901 . times, as shown by the traces of numerous old river beds here and there visible througnout the country. Certain points in the earlier history of the river will be referred to later. I will first deal with its history from the year of Sir Fredrick Goldsmid’s Arbitration Commission, in 1872, to the present day. 6. It is evident, from observations recorded by Sir Fredrick Goldsmid’s Mission durin^ their stay in Seistan, and from careful local investigations now made that in 0 l872 the Helmand River had only one important offshoot, i.e., the Rud-b Seistan. That rud, or canal, as it should more correctly be termed, took off from the Helmand at the Band-i-Kohak (also known as the Band-i- Seistan) which was situated at its present site, and thence followed practically the same course westwards as it does at the present day. 7 The main river, from the Band-i-Seistan northwards, followed its present course to near Shahgul, and, thence, the course of the present Nad Ali and Sikhsar channel into the Naizar and Hamun. The Rud-i-Panun did not exist and the result of so large a volume of water following one channel caused heavy annual inundations of the large area of country known as Warshufti comprising most of Miankangi and Kila-i-Kang tracts. “STCrSLS.tea /uffldeatl, for rood, to grow ore known o, Namr. ^ ^ \8. In his arbitral award, Sir Fredrick Goldsmid, as regards the Helmand and water rights, laid down that:— “ (1) She (Persia) should not possess land on the right of the Hel mand. * * * The main bed of the Helmand, therefore, below Kohak should be the eastern boundary of Persian Seistan, “ (2) and the line of frontier from Kohak to the bills, south of the Seistan desert, should be so drawn as to include within toe Afghan limits all cultivation on both banks of the river from the band upwards. * * * “ (4) It is, moreover, to be well understood that no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the Helmand”. 9. In her appeal against this award, Persia contended, inter alia, that Persian Seistan could not live without control of the Helmand up to Rudbar {vide despatch, dated 27th November 1872, from the Persian Minister in Lon don to Lord Granville) “ le Seistan ne peut vivre qu’avec ses frontibres naturelles de Roudbar, en remontant le (illegible) ses rives s’elbvent de mani- hre qu’il devient impossible de detourner le fleuve de son lit actuel. Le domi nation de Seistan doit done necessairement le dominer au moins jusqu’a Roudbar. * * * Du cote du Nord nous voulons garder le Naizar et vers le Sud Est conserver le Hermunde jusqu’a Roudbar”. 10. These objections, like all others raised by Persia and Afghanistan to the award, were over-ruled on appeal by Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who confirmed the award on 7th March 1873, and the award was subsequently ratified by both countries. 11. Afghanistan does not appear, in her appeal, to have raised any ob jection on the water question in particular, but, subsequent to the confirma tion of the Goldsmid award hy the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Kabul Envoy, deputed to discuss the Goldsmid award with the Government of India, raised the question of the interpretation of clause 4 of that award. He contended that this applied only to new works, and not to (1) canals alreadv in existence and operation, and (2) such old or disused canals as mio-ht be nut in proper repair. ° * ^ 12. Ihe^ Government of India, in referring this question to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^ (despatch No. 74. dated 15th September 18/3;, after pointing out that the Amir desired to construct new, and repair old canals, leading from the He mand, in order to strengthen his frontier and Establish an Afghan colony at Tarakun wrote In our opinion the clause referred to in the award cannot be understood as applying either to existing canals or to such old and disused canals as the Afghan Government may wish to put Tn proper repair; nor would it interfere with the excavation of new canals provided the requisite supply of water for irrigation on the Persian sfde k not diminished. If Her Majesty’s Government concur in this view, we would Amfr ’ aD eXpkliatl0n ma r be S iver “ we can commun cate to the 3. Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs accented the 1 1 e“iw,i i 1 ^ ; : a lf al y “ f01 '“ ed -. The _ above ruling 13. a , lK)V 'vVir r r 1 'as ulu y mrormed. The above rnlins' should, therefore, be considered as an integral portion of the Goldsmid award? 8 14. No water disputes between Afghanistan and Persia are on record for many years after Mr Fredrick Goldsmid’s Mission. In the meantime the Helmand showed an increasing tendency to find outlets to the west, and large portions of its volume appear to have found their wav westwards throufh channels of which the most important were the Shela-i-Shamshiri, a SS now known as Shela-i-Lakshakh, taking off below Puri ; A. ’a channel Shela-i-Jehanabad taking off above Burj-i-As The two latter drew off much water towards Jehanabad, and discharged it into the low lying land' between that place and Jelalabad, whence it escaped northwards through theAshkin* lands, into the Naizar and Hamun. The main irrigation channel on the east bardv of the Helmand, below Kohak, was then the present Shela-i- Oharkk near Bnrj-i-As. 15. The escape westwards of so large a volume of the Helmand relieved much of the Warshufti lands of excessive inundation, and hence we find this tract being gradually brought under cultivation. The village of Deh Dost Muhammad, with its large area of cultivation, came into existence about 1883, and numerous other villages appeared in the Warshufti tract. 16. Water disputes soon arose, and the Persian Government, in October 1883, (despatch, dated 1st October 1883, from the Persian Poreign Minister to the British Minister, Tehran) complained that the Afghans had diverted the Helmand into Afghan territory by constructing the Band-i-Shamshiri. They were unable, when asked, to define the position of this band, and Dr. Bellew (who had accompanied the Goldsmid Mission) was also unable to say where it was. 17. As the Afghan Boundary Commission soon afterwards visited Seistan in 1884, en route to the Russian border, Colonel West Ridgeway was instruct ed to enquire into, and report on, this dispute. He failed [vide letter No. 183, dated the 6th November 1884) to define the position of the band, and expressed his inability to indentify the point at which the Goldsmid boundary leaves the Helmand, and could not, therefore, state whether the Band-i-Shamshiri was situated above or below that point, or consequently whether the Afghans were entitled at the site of that band to the whole water of the Helmand. 18. He urged the necessity of an officer being at once deputed with authority to examine and survey the country and, by determining the position of the Goldsmid line, settle these and other questions in dispute. After some correspondence between the Government of India, the British Government, and Persia, the matter seems to have been dropped. 19. Prom careful local enquiries, we have ascertained that the Band-i- Shamshiri referred to was constructed across the then mouth of the Shela-i- Shamshiri,t which then took off from the main river at a point between Deh Taust and the present village of Deh Lalla. It was constructed to prevent the Shamshiri drawing off too large a volume of the river, and to thus feed the Sikhsar and other Afghan channels. It was first constructed about 1883, and was maintained until 1895. The changes in the river caused by the flood ot 1896 rendered it no longer necessary. 20. In 1885, an unusually large flood came down the Helmand, which turned the Shela-i-Lakshakh into the main river, and reduced the Sikhsar, hitherto the main channel, to a small stream, which, however, continued to be recognised as the boundary, under the name of Shela-i-Sim (boundary stream). 21. When Colonel Yate visited Seistan in the spring of 1894, the Lakshakh SVl . la; Pok; . k or sheia-i channel was still the main channel of the oh 5 .!^ Helmand, but the Shela-i-Jehanabad§ a. h. McMahon. which, when he crossed, was half- way between Milak and Deh Sayad, was but little smaller than the Lakshakh. These two channels, as before described, escaped on to the Ashkin land, and thence into the Hamun. In short, from between Jelalabad and Jehanabad these two channels followed northwards what now forms the northern portion of the Rud-i-Pariun. , . , 22 In 1896, one of those very important changes occurred to which the Helmand river is subject. The Helmand, in the heavy flood of that year, J±elnia p urs t through the protection embank- This embankment had been previously breached ment || on ^he left bank betWOPen Sliallgul by 'floods iu 1865 and 1895, but agam repaired. ^ Milak, and Cut Out for itself a UCW a. h.

The Afghan Government deputed Musa Khan of Herat to Seistan to meet a Persian representative and settle up boundary and water disputes. Musa Khan arrived in Seistan in November 1901, and the Persian represent ative, the Yamin-i-Nizam, arrived in May 1902. 28. The Kussian Consul, Mr. Miller, incited both sides against the other, as admitted freely to me by both, in the hope that, when things readied a crisis, his intervention would be called for, 29. The Yamin-i-Nizam declined to meet the Afghan representative, and the Governor of Chakansur, Akbundzada Pakir Muhammad Khan, abandoning all hope of amicable settlement, occupied Deh Dost Muhammad in Miankangi on 6th July 1902. Persia was reminded by the British Government of her obligations under Article 6 of the Treaty of 1857, and on 24th July 1902, the Persian Government asked for British intervention. His Highness the Amir agreed to a settlement of Seistan disputes by British arbitration, and an arbi trator was duly appointed. Persia, in accepting arbitration, laid down as a condition thereof that both the arbitral award and the final decision of His Majesty s Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs should be in accordance with the terms of the Goldsmid award. 30. In the meantime, owing to long continued drought in the catchment area of the Helmand, the river during 1902 was of abnormally small volume, and scarcity of water in Seistan, occurring just at the time when mutual rela tions were strained, led to irrigation works being carried out on both sides to injure each other. Pariun, which, from that time onwards, has taken the main volume of the whole river due northwards, between Jelalabad and Jehanabad, and through the Ashkin lands to the Hamun. 23. Owing to the above changes in the river, it became necessary, in the autumn of 1896, to take measures for keeping up the supply in the Nad Ali channel, and the Persians and Afghans mutually decided to co-operate to build a band across the Pariun. About three-quarters of a mile below Hie bifurcation, a hard bed was found in the Pariun. This was chosen as the site of the band; but as it was about three-quarters of a mile below the bifurcation, it was thought necessary to dig a leading cut to the Nad Ali channel. Although the band was built in concert, each party dug his own feeding cut, dropping it into the Nad Ali channel near Deh Khoja above the Shela-i-Jehanabad. 24. This arrangement was continued in 1897, but in 1898 the Afghans began work on another cut above the Pariun band; the Persians objected to this as being in their territory, and the Afghan gangs were removed to Afghan territory, and the present Afghan cut (Ju-i-Afghan) was made from the river to the Nad Ali channel to the south, and upstream, of the bifurcation. They also built a band at its head, called the Band-i-Shahgul, which has been made each year since then, except in 1903, when the supply that went down the Nad Ali channel was ample, and no band was required. The Persians began to build a Pariun band, but did not complete it, and never built it again until 1904. 25. The Governors of Persian and Afghan Seistan seem to have settled amicably any water disputes that arose The water disputes of 1901 and 1902. p i. j x i f • from time to time, and no disputes of im portance arose until 1901, when the Persians extended one of their canals from the Rud-i-Pariun, past Takht-i-Shah, into the Naizar, and the Afghans cut a a small canal to take off the Sikhsar water from near Deh Gul Shah to the west. 26. It is probable that these disputes, like previous ones, would have been mutually settled by the local Governors, but outside influences, which had by that time reached Seistan, prevented this. 4. Russian Consul had now come to Seistan, and he seized the opportunity to embitter the mutual relations existing between the countries. This and other subsequent water disputes, themselves of a trifling nature, were made to assume fictitous importance, until all hope of local settlement lapsed.31. In view of the importance which was attached hy the Persian Gov ernment to the trivial incidents of this period, it is perhaps necessary to describe what occurred in some detail. 32. About the beginning of August 1902, the Helmand fell so low that the whole river was absorbed by the canal at Rudbar, and none found its way down the main bed beyond the Rudbar band. Such a thing had never been •Twice before the Helmand is said to have dried up known befoiC 1 he dry liver bed as far as Kiia-i-Fath, but only for a few days in each presented a most unusual appearance, and case * A ‘ H * McMahon - Major Benn, on visiting it, reported that the summer wind had banked up high sandhills across the bed, and made it difficult to distinguish it from the surrounding country. 33. Such was the state of affairs until the 22nd September, when a flood down the Helmand reached the Band-i-Seistan. This, by the accumulation of sand on it, had become so staunch that it diverted the whole river into the Rud- i-Seistan, and no water found its way through the band until the 24th, when a crowd of cultivators prepared a way for it onwards through the sandhills formed in the riverbed. The Shahgul band {i.e., the band across the Rud-i-Pariun at the mouth of the Ju-i-Afghan) like the Band-i-Seistan, owing to the sand hanked against it, diverted the whole river through the Ju-i-Afghan into the Nad Ali channel, and for many days none found its way through the band into the Rud-i-Pariun. 34. Tamarisk bands, when made in the ordinary way, allow half tbe volume of a river or canal to percolate through them. Percolation can be further res tricted to any extent by strengthening the bands with earth. Bands are made to divert water into a small channel, such as the Nahr-i-Sultani, &amp;c , and do not of course turn off half tbe whole stream, as the amount they can divert is naturally limited to the capacity of the channel which takes off at that point. 35. The Afghans now demanded that, in accordance with custom, the Band- i-Seistan should not be allowed to divert more than half tbe volume of the Helmand into the Rud-i-Seistan, but the Persians refused. At the same time, the Persians demanded that the Shahgul Band should only divert half the volume of the river at that place into the Nad Ali channel. This the Afghans refused, and, owing to tbe ill-feeling existing between them, both sides began a series of retaliatory works. 36. The Afghans opened out an old cutting from the Helmand, at a point about five miles above the Band-i-Seistan, to feed the important Jaroki canal, which had been hitherto taken off at about five miles below the Band-i-Seistan. This cut is now known as the Nahr-i-Sultani. 37 . The Persians, in retaliation, turned out a gang of some thousand armed labourers, and hastily excavated a new channel called the Naobar-i-Puza Jang Jah, to outflank the Shahgul Band and turn the river into the Rud-i- Pariun. The Afghans, in their turn, threatened to band the river above the Naobar-i-Puza Jang Jah and turn the water into the Jaroki. 38. The Nahr-i-Sultani and Naobar-i-Puza Jang Jah were each finished in about a month ; but before they could be made use of, and before further acts of retaliation could be carried out, an unusually early winter flood came down the Helmand, which, early in December, completely demolished the Band-i- Seistan, the Shahgul Band, and the new bands at the mouths of the Nahr-i- Sultani and Naobar-i-Puza Jang Jah. It filled the Rud-i-Seistan, the Rud-i- Pariun, and the Nad Ali channels, and re-established the normal water condi tions of Seistan. 39 . During the course of the above disputes, the Persian officials in Seistan represented to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul in Seistan that the restrictions laid down, as regards new irrigation works in the Goldsmid award, applied to the whole course of'the Helmand River up to its source. The Government of India, on bein 0, referred to by Major Benn, replied (their telegram No. 2335, dated 25th August 1902) that “ Goldsmid’s remarks cannot be held to apply to any part of the Helmand other than that with which he was dealing, viz., the part which forms the boundary40.

A high river, in the spring of 1903, refilled the Hamun area which had completely dried up in 1902, a thing hitherto unknown m beistan, and brought it to its normal height. 41. The Band-i-Seistan was reconstructed as usual, in the autumn of 1903, but no necessity was found for reconstructing the Shahgul Band, as the Nad Ali channel was drawing a sufficient volume of water.^ No water disputes occurred during 1903. The Afghans completed the Nahr-bSultani, and so far developed it as to irrigate, by it, the whole cultivated tract^ on the right bank of the river between the Band-i-Seistan and the Shela-i-CharKh. 42. I strongly advised the Persians to close the Naobar-i-Puza Jang Jah as likely to divert the whole Helmand into it, to their own injury. It was, therefore, closed by substantial bands. 43. In 1904, the Helmand was not so high as the preceding year. The Afghans reconstructed, in July, the Shahgul Band, and made a band, also, across the Helmand at the mouth of the Nahr-i-Sultani. 41. No disputes worth mentioning regarding water arose during the year between Persians and Afghans, but alarming reports were brought through Russian agency to the notice of the Persian Government regarding the band at the Nahr-i-Sultani. The Persian Commissioner was instructed to present to me a formal protest. In doing so, he said the Afghans had no right to make any bands above the Band-i-Kohak. I was able to point out that the Nahr-i-Sultani, even with its band, was only then drawing one-hundredth part of the Helmand, and that the band, therefore, was not in contradiction to the terms of the Goldsmid award. 45. Unless a British officer had been on the spot in this case to give a definite opinion as to the actual facts, I have no doubt that a great deal of fuss would have been made, leading to much correspondence and misunderstanding. If any proof is necessary to show that the Nahr-i-Sultani Band was not depriv ing Persian Seistan of her requisite supply of water, I may here note that, at the time of their protest, the Persians had not begun their annual reconstruction of the Band-i-Kohak. This was not begun until 1st September, an unusually late date. 46. I come now to the results of the observations and measurements made Results of observations and enquiries by this Mission in the matter of Seistan of the seistan Mission. water and land. The measurements of the volume of the Helmand, and its branches, made during 1903 and 1904, show that the relative volumes are fairly constant, the effect of the Band-i-Seistan being to secure for the Rud-i-Seistan very nearly half the water of the Helmand at the band during the earlier and more important part of the sowing time of spring crops, when the river is slowly rsing from its minimum. When the winter floods carry away the band, the Rud-i-Seistan and the Nad Ali channel draw much the same proportion of the supply, varying from one-tenth to one- fifth of the whole volume, the balance going down the main, or Pariun, stream. In very high flood, the Nad Ali channel draws more than the Rud-i-Seistan, 47. During the flood season, there is generally too much water every where, and questions of water division do not arise. It will suffice, therefore, for the purpose of this enquiry, to deal only with the river during the critical time of the year, when the river is low, and when water is wanted for the sowing of the spring crops. In Seistan this period extends from the 21st September to the 21st March —vide paragraph 58 below.' Any division of water arrived at on the basis of spring crop cultivation would apply equally to autumn crop cultivation in abnormal summers, when a low river may make the correct distribution of water a matter of importance. 48. It has been ascertained from observations made that, in normal years, throughout that season of the year (during sowing of the spring crops), the average volume of the Helmand at Bandar-i-Kamal Rfian is 4,200 cusecs.We thus see that, from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan downwards to the Band- i-Seistan, the Afghans take off only T J s ths of the whole river above the Band- i-Seistan, and an equal amount below it, whereas the Persians at, or below, the Band-i-Seistan take off ,^ 0 tks of the whole volume of the Helmand which passes Bandar-i-Kamal Khan ; and that the Persians are only able to utilise ^ths of the water which goes down the Parkin, the remainder flowing on into 51 As regards the Helmand from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan upwards to Rudbar we find that there are the following Afghan canals (not included m the above calculations) whose volumes, during the spring crop season, are recorded below:— Rudbar canal ... ••• ... ... 25 cusecs. Chahar Burjak canal ... ... 30 „ Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, old canal ... ... ... 16 „ Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, new canal ... ... 12 „ Total ... S3 „ The Rudbar canal actually tabes off at Pulalak; the Chahar Burjak canal at Puza Mashi; and the two Bandar-i*Kamal Khan canals opposite Chahar Buriak. It is . important to note that the Chahar Burjak and the Bandar-i- Kamal Khan old canals are both capable of very large future extension, which would irrigate lands below Kila - i-Path and in Tarakun, respectively. The Afghans are not likely to be able, by themselves, to effect anything like the full amount of possible extension ; but, even with their present methods, they could draw off a very appreciable portion of the volume of the Helmand at the time of low river, thereby largely affecting the volume available below Bandar- i-Kamal Khan. If we consider the whole amount of water taken by Persians and Afghans respectively, in the spring crop season, from Rudbar downwards, we find that the volume of the Helmand (calculated at the head of the Rudbar canal at Pulalak) is appropriated as follows:— By Afghans ... ... ... ••• ••• 16/100ths „ Persians ... ... ... ... 62/l00ths Flows unused into the Hamun ... ... ... 22/100ths 52. Although the Persians use this large proportion of the volume of the * This waste by flooding fallowlands does much Helmand, it must not be SUppOSed for a injury by causing such lands to get salt, it, more- jQoment that they really require so much over, causes great inconvenience by the flooding of . . ^ i, • 1 • .1 roads and paths. water for their cultivation. A large a. h. McMahon. portion is wasted * owing to their careless system of irrigation, and, as I will endeavour to prove, a considerably smaller supply of water would amply suffice for their actual requirements. 53. Our measurements and observations have clearly proved that the average “ duty ” of water in Persian Seistan, or, in other words, the amount of land irrigated by a fixed quantity of water, amounts, during the season of spring crops, to 53 acres of land to one cnsec of w r ater. 54. The average spring crop duty of the four big Punjab perennial canals for 1901-02 works out at 173 acres of land to one cusec of water. Applying the Punjab scale to Persian Seistan, the 141,000 acres (the normal area) of spring crop cultivation w r ould require only about 815 cusecs, &amp;.&lt;?., less than ^th of the volume of the Helmand at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan (4,200 cusecs). 55. It should be remembered, also, that not only does the cool, fine soil of Seistan require less water than Punjab soil, but the cold Seistan winter, with its showers of rain, and occasional snowfall, would enable Seistan to do with less surface watering than would be the case in the Punjab at that season. The “ duty ” ought, therefore, to be greater than in the Punjab. 56. It is, therefore, reasonable to state that Persian Seistan could amply irrigate considerably more than its present area of cultivation with £th only of the volume of the Helmand at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, if husbanded anddistributed with but ordinary care. One-third of the Helmand, 1,400 cusecs, would similarly suffice for the irrigation of no less than 242,000 acres. Th n ^°^ al area of s P rin = cro P cultivation in Persian Seistan is, now-a-days, 141,000 acres, and admits of large extension. The present cultivated area of Afghan Seistan is only some 22,700 acres. The area capable of irrigation and cultivation on the right bank of the Helmand is however, about equal to that in Persian Seistan. A vast area of land, once cultivated but now deserted, in the Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts is, moreover capable of irrigation and cultivation from the Helmand, by construction of irrigation works of no very great magnitude. Much of this tract is situated in Persian territory. 58. The period of sowing for spring crops in Seistan is an unusually long one. It may be said to extend from the autumn equinox, on 21st September to the spring equinox, on 21st March, i.e., the Naoroz. The Helmand, during this period, is recovering from its annual minimum by a steady gradual rise in * volume from the beginning of September to Xmas. Prom Xmas to Naoroz, the river increases by rapid rises to a very large volume. After 21st March, watering of the later sown spring crops and sowing of autumn crops continue simultaneously without detriment to each other. The unusually long period of sowing in Seistan is a fact to be carefully remembered. In this report, this sowing period is called the “ spring crop season 59. The Helmand reaches its maximum annual volume about the end of April, and is reduced to its annual minimum by about the end of August. 60. The Band-i-Seistan is constructed, annually, towards the end of August. The Shahgul Band is reconstructed, as a rule, a little earlier than this. In normal years both bands are widely breached by the rising river about Xmas time, and then cease to serve their original purpose. All the various canals leading from the Helmand, both those above and those below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, occasionally necessitate bands across a portion, or even the whole channel, of the Helmand. There is no fixed custom about the time for constructing them. They are only constructed when required or when feasible, and are never constructed on the large scale of the Band-i-Seistan and Shahgul Band. 61. A few remarks are necessary regarding the future possibilities in Persian and Afghan Seistan, respectively, of large extension of cultivation, as preceding remarks apply chiefly to such moderate extensions as can be carried out from existing irrigation works. The simplest method of arriving at a fair understanding of this point is to take the gross areas of land in each country, which are roughly as follows:— In Afghan Seistan— Tarakun tract Elsewhere Total ... 2,697 square miles. ... 1£10 „ „ ... 4,207 „ „ In Persian Seistan— Hauzdar tract Elsewhere Total Grand total 1,139 1,728 2,867 7,073 Afghan exceeds Persian land in the proportion of 4 to 3; but when the proportionately larger area of uncommandable dasht and sandhills in Afghan territory is taken into consideration, we find that the total culturable areas in Afghan and Persian Seistan may he treated as approximately equal. In one portion of the above, viz., the Tarakun and Hauzdar tract, the Afghan area is double that of the Persian, but the Persian share consists of10 nearer the head of the water-supply. Takin- the above facts into consideration, and allowing for the superior claims of present cultivation to water, the following rough dmsum of water would very fairly meet all possible future requirements ird of the Helmand to Afghan territory on the right bank below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, ird „ „ „ Persian „ „ left „ Band-i-Seistan. 3 , r(1 ” )( () the Tarakun and Hanzdar tracts in the proportion of half to each. This 3 arrangement would thus give one-half of the whole Helmand to Persia and the other half to Afghanistan. 62. The above remarks deal with the history of the Helmand from 1872 • +Vi a and its present conditions only. To obtain hWOTy^of Hetmand pre£ous to 1872. the necessary data on which to base any reliable conclusions as to what the river is likely to do m the future, and the consequences thereof, it is necessary to extend certain enquiries fu back than 1872. 63. These show ns, in the first place, that the river, from time immemorial, has been subject to sudden and important changes of its course. Like all si t laden streams in a deltaic region, the courses of its mam channel and br ^ n « run along the tops of ridges, the height ot which is ever increasing, and from which the ground slopes downwards on either side. It takes but little to divert the stream to either side, and we find that the main bed of the He mand, after entering its delta, has flowed from time to time m many different directions. 64. What it has done in the past it will do again in the future, unless controlled, and we now already know of several points where, at any day during the flood time, the Helmand, either through some ill-advised impediment or outlet, or through natural causes, might divert itself into a totally different channel. It will suffice to point out the principal places where this might happen, and where past warnings indicate that this is likely to happen. (1) Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. In the flood of 1885 a large portion of the Helmand entered the God-i-Zirreh from here, by an old Helmand bed. It may easily do so again, and revert entirely to its old bed. (2) Krom the end of the cliffs which confine the Helmand on the right hank near Kila-i-Fath, to the Band-i-Seistan, there are many places where the river has only to cut through a low natural ridge of alluvial soil to escape into the large low-lying tracts which extend to, and beyond, Sar-o-tar and Amiran. Big floods have on several occasions passed over this ridge, but, so far in modern times, have never seriously breached it. In former times the river once went down to that tract, and may do so again. (3) Near Shahgul, where the Helmand, in 1903, broke the protection embankments, and a large portion of the river found its way through Khadang. This might easily become the main channel, and leave both the Nad Ali channel and the Bud-i-Pariun dry. (4) The gradual rise of the level* of the Bud-i-Seistan above the bed of the Helmand justifies the supposition that, some day, no band which the Persians will be capable of making, will draw water into that canal. • It must also be remembered that the construction of the Band-i-Seistan, year after year, has caused a natural bar to form across the river, and on this bar the band is now made. The bar is several feet above the natural level of the river bed above or below this point. Failure to erect the band any year, or other cause, might easily cause the river to scour through this bar, and the task of making a band there might become impracticable. A. H.

J This was the natural consequence of a long and widespread cycle of dry years, i863 to 1877. A. H. McMahon. Our enquiries beyond 1872, secondly, establish the fact that, in the ‘ ' ' past 75 years,* i.e., 1830 to 1904, there have been two years of abnormal floods (1830 and 1885), several years of great floods, very many years of normal flood, and only three years of abnormally low river, when no water at all for a short period in the summer reached the Band-i- Kohak, viz.^ 1838, 1871, and 1902. The last one was the worst of the three. Curiously enough in no one of these three years was the subsequent sowing season of spring crops injuriously affected or did the spring crops, on which the welfare of Seistan depends, suffer. 66. In only three years out of the past thirty-five was water deficient^ at winter time for spring crop sowing, viz., 1877, 1878, and 1880. This is a fact which must be carefully kept in mind in dealing with the Seistan water question. 67. Seistan suffers, therefore, more from excess of water than deficiency thereof. For each one of the above three years of deficiency, there have been very many in which crops have suffered largely from floods, not only owing to direct inundation from the rivers, but from the Hamun itself rising and over flowing the protection embankments, on which alone a large area of Persian Seistan depends for safety from inundation. In the two years of abnormal flood in 1830 and 1885, not only all crops, but also all the buried stores of grain from previous harvests were destroyed. 68. In the foregoing remarks it has been necessary to enter somewhat into details. In case these may have Summary of general conclusions. obscured any of the more important salient points, it is advisable, even at the risk of a little repetition, to summarise the principal facts and data. 69. The data and axioms available for the solution of this problem may be briefly defined as follows :— (1) No definite disputes can be specifically stated as now requiring V 7 individual settlement. The water question is one of broad princi ples. The Persian Government vaguely claim that the Afghans have no rio&gt;ht to erect bands above the Band-i-Seistan, as these must diminish the present volume of water at that place. The Afghan Government do not admit that there is any water ques tion in dispute, as their geographical position makes them sole owners of the wh&lt; le Helmand above the Band-i-Seistan. The present arbitration is restricted by the condition that the award V J must be in accordance with the terms of the Goldsmid award. f51 That award, and the interpretation thereof, as ruled by the Secretary V of State for Foreign Affairs in 1873, which now forms an integral portion of it, are stated in paragraphs 8 to 13 above. The only thing that appears absolutely necessary to be now done ' ’ ; s t0 define the term “ water requisite for irrigation on both banks of the Helmand ”. 171 It is reasonable to assume that by irrigation is meant not only 1 present irrigation, but possible future extension of irrigation and cultivation on both banks. IS) To estimate the requisite supply of water, we must first calculate 8 the culturable areas for which it is required on each hank. It is impossible to get an accurate estimate if we restrict our calculations to only lands on both banks below Band-i-Seistan, the point where the Helmand now happens to reach Persian ( 2 ) (3), • 12 territory. An accurate estimate must include nil Afghan and Persian lands in Seistan, and Seistan may be defined as the tract comprising the whole Helmand delta, i.e.&gt; lands on both banks of the Helmand from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, downwards, includ ing the Tarakun and Hauzdar tract. (9) The requisite supply of water, when estimated, cannot safely be expressed in terms of the volume of the Helmand at Band-i- Seistan, because the Afghans, by irrigation works above that point, can divert more and more of the river, and, thus, very seriously diminish the volume at that point. Moreover, the past history of the Helmand shows that the river has always been subject to sudden and important changes of its course. Natural causes or ill-advised irrigation works might at any time divert the river into a new channel and prevent any water at all reaching the Band-i-Seistan at Kohak. Any division of the Helmand water representing the “ requisite supply ” should, therefore, be expressed in terms of the volume of the river above the point where water is first diverted to irrigate Seistan lands. This point, at present, has been fixed at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. An award, to be of really permanent value, should provide for the con tingency of that point being moved further up the river. (10) The question of water for irrigation may be said, in Seistan, to need consideration only during the season for spring crops {vide paragraph 58 above), viz., 21st September to 21st March, when the river is low. During the rest of the year, except in very low and abnormal years, Seistan suffers from excess, and not deficiency, of water. In such abnormal years, any division of water based on requirements of spring crop cultivation would fully meet the case of autumn crop requirements {vide paragraph 47 above). (11) At present, during the season for spring crops, the Persians * a j ^ * a k e 63/100ths and the As measured at Bandar-i-hamal Khan, para- J i ta it e graphs 48 and 50 above. Afghans Only 14/100ths of the whole Helmand.* Of the latter amount, the Afghans take off one-half (7/100ths) between Bandar-i-Kamal Khan and Band-i-Seistan (Kohak), and the other half below the Band-i-Seistan. (12) The Persians waste a large portion of the water they take off. It has been ascertained that l/5th of the water of the Helmand (as measured at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan) would, with proper care, ampiy suffice to irrigate more than their present area of annual 51 t^SeTbove)^ the SeaS ° n f ° r SPring Cr ° PS ^ ide P ara S ra P bs (13) Taking into consideration future possible extensions of cultivation m Seistan, it has been ascertained that the following division of the Helmand would meet the requirements of all culturable tracts m Persian and Afghan Seistan : one-third to Afghan territory on the right bank of the Helmand ; one-third to the present inhabited area of Persian Seistan, i.e’ the tracts irrigated from and below the Band-i-Seistan (Kohak); one-thn^o^the^Tarakun and Hauzdar tract jointly owned by Persia In other words the Persian and Afghan share of the Helmand might fairly be fixed at one-half of the whole volume for each. 5 y (14) Under the existing conditions of Seistan, where outside influence prevents mutual or amicable settlement of water questions, no award will succeed in obviating future misunderstandings and I 11 ™* 011 / ■ I Ilnless a com Petent officer of irrigation experience be appointed as a permanent referee, who can give a definite opinion m each case of dispute. He need not necessarily - haveany executive authority, as it would suffice for him to £?ive an opinion in each case, and, when necessary, take the requisite steps to have the facts of any case brought to the notice of the Government concerned. He would, in short, be a permanent arbitrator on water questions. (15) If any definition of Persian right to water is made in the award in favour of Persia which in any way restricts the general rights to the Helmand which geograpl ical position has otherwise given Afghanistan, it follows that Persia is not necessarily entitled to alienate rights thus given to her, without Afghan consent. (16) Finally, in framing any water award, the fact must be kept care fully in mind that, if it is to have any chance of future success, the definition of water rights and division of water must be worded in terms which both Afghans and Persians understand, and which involve no new or complicated methods of calculation or distribution. The complicated systems of division so easily carried out by a skilled irrigation staff, elsewhere, are not at present applicable to Seistan. Divisions of shares stated in terms of cusecs would not be understood, and would not be workable. A glance at the statement in paragraph 48 will show the difficulty of this. The Afghans and Persians of Seistan do, however, thoroughly understand division of water in terms of shares of the total volume of a stream. In their system of bands and canals, they have a very shrewd instinctive knowledge of the proportion of water any channel takes off from the main stream, and of how to alter that proportion. 70. It now only remains to consider the form of arbitral award most , suited to meet the requirements of the Consideration of form of water award. ^ ThiSj apart from other reasons, is a matter of extraordinary difficulty owing to the attitude of the countries con cerned. Neither are, themselves, fully awake to the dangers which threaten the question of water-supply in Seistan. 71. The local Persians are stolidly indifferent on the subject, as they do not look beyond existing conditions, and the view of Persian officialdom, if left to themselves, is probably very accurately defined in the Shah’s own words— “ the water has come and the matter is finished ” {vile despatch from Sir A. Hardinge, Tehran, to the Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 180, dated the 29th December 1902, and enclosures). The Russians, however, have left nothing undone thoroughly to alarm the Persian Government on this subject, and hence the desire of the Persian Government, as expressed through their Persian Commissioner, to get their future water rights clearly and definitely safeguarded in my award. The Russians will undoubtedly continue to alarm the Persian Government in the future. They will closely criticise any award that may be given, and seize any opening it may afford of influencing Persia to appeal against it. 72 The Afghans, on the other hand, contend that no water questions are in dispute They claim all the Helmand above Kohak, and will resent any attempt to restrict their supposed rights thereto. They understand the advantage which their geographical position gives them, and signs are not wanting that they will, some day, try to score off the Persians by inter ermg with their present waier-supply. They tail to understand how their attempt to do so may endanger their own supply. 73 Two forms of award present themselves : one which merely reiterates the Goldsmid award, with such definitions as may appear necessary, and which leaTes° matters practically in their present condition ; another which boldly attempts to tackle the real difficulties of the question, and, while pointing out future dangers, does its best to provide for them. The former is only likely to prove of a temporary nature: the latter may have^ome chance of more pe/man^nt duration. Which are we to choose ? 74 .

All the five Articles of this award, are common to the other drafts. r f 1R7 o It does little more than add the Secretary of State’s ruling of 1873, to Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award. It leaves things, otherwise, much as they are at . present, hut provides for future disputes by the appointment of a permanent arbitrator. , . , 77 Draft B.— This goes further, and defines the amount of watei requi site for Persian requirements, based, however, only on the present inhabited portion of Persian Seistan irrigable from and below the Band-i-Kohak. It allows for extension of present cultivation, and gives Persia the right to 3 rd of the Helmand. . 78 Draft C—This goes still further, and provides for the possible tuture irrigation of the Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts. The right of Perisa to a requisite supply of water {i.e., Jth of the Helmand) for her share of hose tracts is recognised and provided for, but only m the event of their being here after brought under irrigation. 79 Draft D —Tackles the whole question boldly as a whole, and gives Persia one-haif of the Helmand forthwith, whether the Hauzdar tract is brought under irrigation or not. 80. Great care has been taken to avoid unnecessary details in each draft, and especially those which might create unnecessary suspicions, give rise to needless objections or quibbles, or be unnecessarily distasteful to one or other party. As an instance of this, it will be observed that in all four drafts no calcula tion of water is expressed in terms of cusecs [vide paragraph 69 (16)]. Nor again are the proportionate shares of the Helmand, now used by either side, stated in the awards. To do so, would only give Persia a pretext for claiming a share of water based on custom, quite ignoring her own condition that the Goldsmid award is not to be departed from. 81. I have fully recognised the fact that, in the ratio that Persian rights are more and more definitely defined in each draft, the A.fghans, with their exaggerated ideas of their own rights, will express the greater dissatisfaction. t nfvo tn rpdnfift the chance of this to a minimum, hut the task is not an easy one. 82. Even an Afghan, however, must acknowledge, when it is brought home to him, as it should be, that any settlement which restricts Persian right to water to certain limits is in the present case a distinct gain to Afghanistan who has hitherto taken off only nfoths of the whole river from Rudbar down wards, while the Persians have taken ^ths. Any deferred settlement of the question might have to recognise the Persian right to what custom may have entitled them to, and not, as in the present case, to their requisite supply of water only. This argument will be made the most of in the official commu nication conveying my formal copy of the award to the Afghan Government.83. Persia cannot reasonably grumble at any settlement which defines and safeguards her right to a requisite supply of water, at the threatened loss of which she evinces such alarm. 84. No award will necessarily much affect the actual distribution of water in practice, at any rate, not for a considerable period of time. The Afghans will gradually take off more water; but unless the Helmand is properly controlled above Seistan, or unless from natural causes, or ill-advised or malicious irrigation works, the river is diverted into a new channel, the Persians will always be able to take more water from the Hemand than they want to use without depriving the Afghans of the amount they require. 85. I trust that enough has been said to explain the water problem, and to enable the Government of India to decide which form of solution thereof is most suitable. The details connected with the problem have, I fear, made this memorandum a somewhat lengthy one. I have endeavoured throughout to effect at least one result, i.e., that, whichever award may be selected, it will obviate any future deadlock in Seistan on water questions. Should draft A, for instance, be selected, and the opening of a new canal, hereafter, into Tarakun raise the question of Persian right to water for Hauzdar, the arrangement proposed in Draft 0 or D could be brought into effect through the medium of the permanent arbitrator, and so on. A. H. McMahon, Colonel, British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission. Arbitral Award on the Seistan water question. Draft A. Preliminary remarks. 1 General Sir Frederick Goldsmid, as Arbitrator between Persia and Afghanistan, was called upon to settle the question of rights to land and water of Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan. He delivered an arbitral award on both uoints in 1872, which was confirmed by 444# Majesty’s Secretary of State for ^Foreign Affairs, and accepted by the Persian and AJghan Governments ^ 18 9 3 ’ At tbe time of the above award, the Helmand River had one main distributary channel in Seistan, i.e .,the Rud-i-Seistan, at the mouth of which, in order to divert sufficient water into this Rud, was a tamarisk band known as tbe^andd-Kohak or^e^BanddjSm^an^The^Helnmnd^River^from^tlmnce, fhe W SikhsarTnto the Naizar and Hamun.

A. H. McMahon. ZL— accordance with the terms of Sir Frederick Goldsmid s award. _ 7. In framing my award I am, therefore, restricted by the above condition. c Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award on the w'ater question was asfollows:— “ It is’to be clearly understood that no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of irrigation on both banks of the ilelrnaml”. Her Majesty’s Secretary ot State for Foieign All, irs, in'his capacity of final ^firming authority of that award, further laid down in his capacity 01 nnai O &amp; in 18 73 , that the above clause should not The e&gt;»ct wordm^ of ^ be UB( j e , stoo( j t „ apply either to existing canals, or to old or disused canals that it may be desired to put in proper repair, nor would it interefore with the excava tion of new canals, provided that the requisite supply on both hanks is not diminished. 9. The above award is so definite that it is unnecessary to define it further, and I, therefore, give the following award Aicarl. 1. No irrigation works are to he carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the river, but both sides have the right, within their own territories, to maintain existing canals, to open out old or disused canals, and to make new canals from the Helmand River, provided that the supply of water requisite for irrigation on both sides is not diminished.. 2 To enable both sides to satisfy themselves that this award is being com plied with, a British officer of irrigation experience should be appointed as permanent arbitrator in Seistan. He will give an opinion, when required by either party, on any case of doubt or dispute over water questions that may arise. I have here attempted to define his duties and JJe Will, when neCCSSary, take Steps tO limit his responsibilities. ^ ^ McMahon. bring the real facts of any case to the notice of the Government concerned. He will be able also to call the attention of either party to any important indications of threatening danger to their water supply arising from natural causes or their own irrigation works. To enable this officer to properly fulfil the functions of his office, free access should be given to him, by either side, to the Helmand river and its branches and the heads of canals leading therefrom. 3. The maintenance of the Band-i-Kohak is of great importance to the welfare of Persian Seistan. It is possible that the deepening of the river bed at and below the site of the present band may necessitate moving the band a short distance further up the river. Afghanistan should allow Persia to move this band, if necessary, and grant Persia the right to excavate the short canal required from such new band through Afghan territory to the Bud-i- Seistan. Similarly, should it become necessary for Afghanistan to move the present Shahgul Band across the Bud-i-Pariun somewhat lower down that stream, Persia should (as has been done before) allow Afghanistan right of way for a canal through Persian territory from that band to the Nad Ali channel. it is a question for considi ration whether this stipulation should form part of the award, or be settled in subsequent communication with the Afghan and Persian Governments A. H. McMahon. 4. * It will be noted that the rights to the Helmand water, which her geographical position naturally gives to Afghanistan as owner of the upper Helmand, have been restricted to the extent stated above in favour of Persia in accordance with Sir Frederick • This clause applies with greater effect to the other draft awards. A. H. McMahon.Goldsmid’s award. It follows, therefore, that Persia has no right to alienate to any other Power the water rights thus acquired without the consent of Aghan- istan. 5. I cannot close this award without a word of warning to both countries concerned. The past history of the Helmand river in Seistan shows that it has always been subject to sudden and important changes in its course which have, from time to time, diverted the whole river into a new channel, and rendered useless all the then existing canal systems. Such changes are liable to occur in the future, and great care should, therefore, be exercised in the opening out of new canals, or the enlargement of old canals leading from the Helmand. Unless this is done with proper precaution, it may cause the river to divert itself entire ly at such points, and cause great loss to both countries. This danger applies equally to Afghanistan and Persia. Draft B. Preliminary remarks. Paragraphs 1 to 7 as in draft A. 8 . Sir Prederick Goldsmid’s award on the water question was as follows “It is to he clearly understood that no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of irrigation on both banks of the Helmand”. Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his capacity as the final confirming authority of that award,^ further laid down in 1873 as follows “ In our opinion the clause referred to in the award cannot be understood as applying either to existing canals or to such old an disused canals as the Afghan Government may wish to put in proper repair, nor would it interfere with the excavation of new^canals, provided the requisite supply of water for irrigation on the Persian side is not diminished . It is hardly necessary to point out that this ruling of Her Majesty’s Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, while defining certain limits for Afghan works, does not restrict the Afghan right, stated by Sir Frederick Goldsmid, to a requisite supply of water also for Afghan cultivation. Q The above award is so definite that it is unnecessary to make any attempt to define it further, except on one particular point This award pro- vides that Persia has a right to a requisite supply of water for nngation. in order to prevent future misunderstanding, it only remains to define w a amount o/water fairly represents a requisite supply for Persian requirements. in ‘From the careful and exhaustive measurements, observations, and enquiries made by this Mission in Seistan, the following facts have been clear y established:— toss - - is caused by want of water for irrigation.

Paragraph 10 {a) (5) (c) as in draft B. • The irrigation of Tarakon and Hanzdar from the Helmand would bring those lands within the Goldsmid definition of •‘both banks of the Hefmand”. The argument of the Government of India stated in paragraph 39 of my memorandum thus falls through. A. H. McMahon. Paragraph 10 (d). A large area of land in the Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts was &amp; once cultivated. A portion of this area lies within Persian territory. It may at some future time be found possible to irrigate these tracts from the Helmand river, and therefore the right of Persia defined* in Sir Prederick Goldsmid’s award would extend to a requisite supply of water for the Persian portion of those lands also. It+ has been ascertained that water amounting to one-sixth of the whole Helmand would suffice properly to irrigate tne portion of those lands belong ing to Persia. + If thought preferable, this paragraph from here onwards could read thus :—“ It has been ascertained that water amounting to one-third of the whole Helmand river would suffice to properly irrigate the Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts, of which amount one-half (i.e” one-sixth of the Helmand) wonld suffice to irrigate the Persian portion of the said tracts. 11 . I therefore give the following award;— Award. 1 , 2, 3, 4, as in draft B. 5. Should it he hereafter found possible to irrigate from the Helmand the portion of the Taraknn-Hauzdar tract lying within Persian territory, Persia will he entitled to another one-sixth of the volume of the whole Helmand river for the irrigation of that tract.

The above award is so definite that it is unnecessary to attempt to define it further, except in one particular point only, i.e., the supply requisite for irrigation on both banks of the Helmand. 10. It has been ascertained from the careful and exhaustive measure ments and observations made by this Mission that the areas of land capable of cultivation in Persian and Afghan territory in Seistan, including the Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts, are approximately equal in extent. Each country, there fore, requires the same amount of water as the other. 11. Persia now takes off all her water for irrigation at and below the Band-i-Kohak. Afghanistan takes off water for Afghan Seistan partly below and partly above that place. It may become desirable or necessary for Afghan istan to take off more and more of her share of water above the Band-i-Kohak. Division of water should, therefore, be calculated according to the volume of the Helmand river at the point where water is first taken off by one or other side for irrigation of Seistan lands. 12 The Seistan lands, to which Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award applies, comprises the country on both banks of the Helmand river at and below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, including the Tarakun and Hauzdar tracts, therefore, anv division of water should be calculated according to the volume of the Htflmand river at the point where water is first taken oil for irrigation oi land, situated at or below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. 13.

He is exercised in mind about rumours of a big canal Saitip Mir Masum Khan has becmn at Chah Nima from the Rud-i-Seistan. He thinks this will cross the boundary line southwards, and wants me to prohibit it. I think this inci dent can be turned to useful account. SOth September, Cam,p Kohak.-l sent Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah to see the Akhundzada, with instructions what to say if the Chah Nima business is mentioned. Naturally enough it was, and the Akhundzada wants to know whether the Sartip’s canal is being extended across the boundary line. He feared that if it did, the Persians would claim a rectification of the line to meet the case of actual occupation. Mir Shams Shah said the question was one of perfect indifference to me, and that I had declined to take any steps in the matter short of final demarcation with permanent boundary pillars, and, if this be deferred goodness knows what changes may not take place in the extent ot effective occupation by the Persians. The Akhundzada then suggested that I shoulddemarcate the straight line to Koh-i-Malik Siah as agreed upon U week Mir Shams Shah replied that I was now doubtful of the wisdom 01 doing thL, as “ would appear to admit obligation to defer dem— elsewhere Why not begin first on the line northwards . This pu old gentTeman a y bit, and”he finally begged that I would begin where I iked and demarcate where I liked, only , for goodness sake not finish «P J * 1 line and tell him that it is a fait accompli before he gets the T1 ^ ess 7 authority from Kabul to co-operate.

I m.ght at any time however, commence work on the line northwards I may remark here t mt the Afghan fears are absolutely groundless, as the Persians cannot possibly grt any water from the Rud-i-Seistkn across the line without taking it consider ably up hill 1 ,*».** 22nd September, Camp Kohak.-l fixed, some days ago, the site for the first pillar at the Band-i-Kohak, but the high wind has delayed the work of laying out the straight line from there. 23rd September, Camp Kohak.-l have explained the situation to the Yamin, and informed him that 1 am commencing demarcation He showed an inclination to have a voice in fixing boundary pillars, but I have made mm clearly understand that this would necessitate the Afghans haying a similar right, and I decline to permit any arguments on the subject. I had previously told the Akhundzada the same thing, and lie fully acquiesced in the wisdom of it Either Commissioner can, of course, inspect the line and pillars as mucli as he likes, and I will always be willing to hear their objections regarding any pillar which either of them can prove not to be on the boundary line defined in my award. 24th September, Camp Kohak .—I fixed the sites of several boundary pillars on the straight line. Building work will commence forthwith. It necessitates considerable arrangements and much camel transport, for there is no water to be found on the whole length of about 90 miles, except at one place, i. e., the Shelagh. All water for building, and for the building camp, will have to be brought from a distance. The task of building pillars has been undertaken by Mr. Ward and his irrigation staff. A. H.

Please refer to Colonel McMahon’s letter of 25th September 1904, which was forwarded with Secretary’s letter of 13th October. We do not consider it desirable to do anything that may give birth to any idea that the Persians have any claim to extend irrigation by channels to be constructed through Afghan territory. Moreover the Persian Government insisted that the decision in the present case should he in accordence with General Goldsmid’s award, and we prefer to confine the award to this. Award B therefore, seems the most suitable with the following modifications Omit naraoranh 4, of the preliminary remarks, and prefix to paragraph 5 the following sentence —Begins. Unfortunately of recent years, whatever may have been the cause, and whether that was due to the change in the course of the main stream or to more strained relations, the amicable settlement of water difficulties has been found to be no longer possible. /nds. In paragraph 8 More words “ further laid down ”, enter “ after consulting General Goldsmid . ihe rest of clause should run as in Award A. In paragraph 10 C, instead of Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, read Band-i-Kohak. Omit the last section of clause 2 of award from Seistan on, and clauses 3 Slid This is proposed, as it is useless to attempt to prevent the diversion by the Afghans of all the water between Band^-i-Kamal Khan and Band-i-kohak, as thev might do this further up-stream at Kala-i-Bist or elsewhere, and it is vmdesirable to give the Persians any voice in matters outside their own boun - *xvxr The difficulty will be to ensure that Persian Seistan receives 3 of 1 J+hat at present reaches Band-i-Kohak, and the only way of securing this wilTbe to appoint an expert irrigation officer, as suggested by Colonel McMa on. We trust that his proposals in this respect will be approved. But it is a great question if Goldsmid’s award renders it necessary to give Persia more thafenough water for existing irrigation, 141,000 acres, for which Persia mo Helmand would he sufficient. As however, owing to change less than one th h p ersian Seistan , in mam chanIiels founts to 460,800 and as area existing system of cultivation whereby half area lies fallow S’yeirT230,400 acres could he irrigated and cultivated, we think that J of the24 water be allotted to Persians, but this is ^ tbe absolute maximum, and should only be given, if award is accepted in its integrity. If you concur, we would inform McMahon that award to this effect would not be open to objection from our point of view, and that he can announce it when demarcation, which Amir has formally authorised, is completed, provided that political status quo in Seistan is not threatened, in which case he should refer to us for orders.

From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E , British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, Seistan, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Your telegram 4258 E„ 5th November. I fear Persia will loudly dissent at division of water stated in terms of volume of river at Band-i-Kohak, because Persians know that they already enjoy half, or more, of whole river at and below that place, whereas they do not, and are never likely to, know volume at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, or, therefore, what proportion of that they have hitherto enjoyed. Again, if Kohak is defined as place where river enters Seistan, as proposed in paragraph 10 C, Persia will claim half of the river which forms her boundary at and below that place. The Kohak band alone, while in working order from September to December, always draws off at least half of river, and, under above definition, Afghanistan in future will be able to object to this. I see no way of disposing of these two difficulties except by either defining Persian share in terms of volume higher up river, as in my draft award, or granting Persia half the river (that reaches the ?) Band-i- Kohak. Please see my telegram No. 831 of today, quoting Amir’s instructions to Afghan Commissioner about Band-i-Kohak. This forebodes protest against clause 3 of my draft award A, which now forms clause 4 of proposed award. It is impossible to say how long reconstruction of band on the present site will remain possible, but, sooner or later, it must become impossible. A new site could be found a few yards higher up stream, and it would take very many years before the band works its way by short stages up through the half mile above present site which admits of its construction. Perhaps this point could be satisfactorily explained to the Amir and settled at Kabul. The Persians have not yet realised dangers to present band site, and have said nothing on the subject; but for future credit of this arbitration, I would like this clause to be retained, if possible.

Your telegrams of 10th November. Your desire to retain clause 4 of award will be remembered, but Amir’s letter shows that there is no chance of his agreeing to construction by Persians of canals in Afghanistan. Wording of telegram about water award is not quite understood. Our view is that, as Persia, &amp; on Goldsmid’s award, is only entitled to enough water for existing cultivation, she is very well treated in getting one-third of present volume of river at frontier near Band-i-Kohak. If she is contented with half of volume of water that may reach that point, and no restrictions are placed on Afghan use of water up stream, this would, of course, be much more satisfactory solution from Afghan and Indian point of view. The argument that Persia is entitled to half the water below Band-i-Kohak, in addition to what enters Kud-i-Seistan, on the ground that she owns one bank of the river would com pletely ruin her case, as, on a parity of reasoning, Afghanistan would at once claim all the water above the Persian frontier, as she owns both banks of the stream. Your detailed argument is awaited.27 Enclosure No. 13. Telegram, No. 836, dated the 15th (despatched from Robat on 17th) November 1904». From—COLONEL A. H. McMahon, C.S I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, Seistan, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Your telegram 4374 E. Amir would be wise to accept paragraph 3 of my draft award A°as Afghans some day may badly want to take advantage of it. Afghan canal referred to in paragraph 23 of my memorandum was through Persian territory. Also contingency stated in paragraph 64, section 3, ot same memorandum. I regiet my argument regarding water award in telegram of 10th November has been misunderstood. My meaning is that, it tne point at which division of water is to be calculated is fixed at Bund-i-Kohak, then Persia will claim at least half of the river from that point downwards, because it forms her boundary, and the theoretical boundary line runs along midstream; but she would not be satisfied with only this arrangement, because it gives no guarantee that the water above that point will not be so diverted as to render half the river at that point insufficient for her requisite supply. By half the river I here mean of course that the volume of Bud-i-Seistan forms part of that half and is not in addition thereto. The actual boundary line leaves mouth of Rud-i-Seistan in Persia, and the prolongation of the straight line of boundary hits Bund-i-Kohak about half-way across Helmand. One of my reasons for basin 0, division of water on volume at point higher up river is that ratio of that volume to volume at Bund-i-Kohak is unknown to both parties, and Persia, on the one hand, would not realise how much less her awarded portion is than what she has hitherto had the opportunity of using, and would refrain from noisv protest by the guarantee which my definition gives of the continuance of a reouisite supply. On the other hand, Afghanistan would not realise how much more water than Persia is entitled to goes into Persian territory, and would refrain from measures she would otherwise take needlessly to reduce the jimmlv The present status quo would continue longer. If we want to avoid reference to river above Kohak and still safeguard requisite supply of water for Persians, we must add the word “ now ” before the words “ enter into Seistan ” in clause 2 of award. We are, however, then faced by the difficulty, ° 1ater .tao'e, of replying to direct Persian or fghan query as to where river k considered to enter Seistan. I have no further detailed arguments to offer beyond those already in your possession. Please telegraph if further information on any point is required.

Extract from the diary of Colonel A. JEL. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 24th October 1^04. 16th October 1904. —I started on a tour of inspection of the line of boundary pillars which has now been built from here to the Koh*i-Malik Siah. Rode to Chah Muhammad Raza, 30 miles. 17th October. —Rode, via Girdi Chah, to Naluki (30 miles), where I found Mr. Ward and one of his building parties in camp. Wells have been dug at several places in the vicinity of the boundary line, hut, in most cases, without finding water. Here, at Naluki, Mr. Ward lias sunk five wells, two of which contain water which is quite drinkable. The nearest point on the boundary line is 10 miles from here, and a long stretch of boundary pillars has been built with w r ater carried from here. The system by which the building parties have now lived for a whole month on the boundary line, and received daily convoys of water for themselves and building w^ork, has required careful arrangement and large camel transport. Great credit is due to Mr. Ward and his staff for the manner in which it has been carried out. 18th October. —Mr. Ward and I rode to Garden Reg (16 miles). This is the point where the boundary line crosses the Shelag. The water in the Shelag is now concentrated brine, and undrinkable by men or animals. 19th October. —Rode along the boundary line to the last pillar, half-way up the slopes of Koh-i-Malik Siah, and from vdiich the pillar on the peak of the Koh-i-Malik Siah, built by me in 1896 on the Baluch-Afghan Boundary Commission, is clearly visible. The line from the Shelag to the Koh-i-Malik Siah is well and clearly demarcated by pillars throughout, except for a short stretch of three miles, where heavy sandhills have rendered it both unnecessary and impossible to erect permanent marks. I gave orders for four more pillars at certain points where they seemed to be required. From the last pillar we found our way through the foot hills to our camp at Madanu (34 miles from our starting point), a good spring about four miles north of Hiwan Chah, and four miles east of Hurmak. 20th October. —Giving our baggage camels a day’s rest to-day, 1 rode to Hi wan Chah and Robat, and back (32 miles). * * * * * * * 21st October. —Starting at an early hour, Mr. Ward and I struck across the foot hills to the trade route, and rode, through Hurmak, to the Shelag, and thence, leaving the trade route, to the boundary line at pillar No. 70 (40 miles). Here, a supply of water, sent out from Naluki, met us. Between pillar No. 70 and the Shelag is a stretch of eight miles of almost impassable sandhills through which demarcation work is impossible. This, and the stretch of three miles between the Shelag and Koh-i-Malik Siah, are the only two places where sand, sufficient to prevent demarcation, is found on the line. 22nd October. —Rode along the boundary line to a spot called Chah Allahdad, where our efforts to find water by wells have been unsuccessful. Here we found Mr. Tate, an l a supply of water sent out from Naluki. 23rd October. —Rode along the boundary line to the Sena Rud (26 miles), which is an ancient bed of the Helmand. Water had been sent here to, meet us from Deh Khalik Dad, 17 miles. To-day I found that the survey party responsible for correctly laying out the boundary line had, in places, marked sites for pillars, which, now that the pillars have been built and whitewashed, are visibly out of the straight line. 1 have ordered the line to be realigned, which means pulling down and re building several pillars. It is extremely annoying after the care with which the pillars themselves have been built, and the trouble and hardship involved in their construction. Such mistakes, however, are very apt to occur in this country, where high winds shake the surveying instruments and flags, and the glare and mirage during the day make accurate alignment almost impossible.5 tth October .—Leaving Mr. Tate to correct the line, Mr. Ward and I rode into the main camp, 21 miles. 1 found all well. The Akhandzada has been suffering from fever, hut is now, I hear, better. He has as yet received no reply from Kabul about demarcation. Enclosure No. 17.

Translation of a Firman, dated Saturday, 5th Shaban, 1322 (15th October 1904), from His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan, to Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Mulla Khan. Whereas you were deputed on my behalf as representatives for the determination of the separation of the boundaries of Afghanistan in the Naizars of Seistan, and my revered friend Colonel McMahon was deputed on behalf of the allied Government (British) to settle the aforesaid affair, the written award of the latter has now reached me through His Excellency the Viceroy of India, As far as possible, I did my best in correspondence with him to maintain my rights. As I am now convinced that the Government of India have, as far as possible, done justice to Afghanistan, and consider that the settlement which they have made is in the interests of my State, therefore I know this also that in no way have they neglected, nor will they neglect, my interests. Without doubt, in determining the frontier, and in the settlement of the aforesaid tract, they will bear our welfare in sight. Therefore, in accordance with the written award of the aforesaid Colonel, the details of which were copied on a separate paper and sent to you, you are informed that you are to take action in pillar building, so that the work may be finished during this season. But with regard to distribution of water, which is pot mentioned in the papers, you will exercise great care that (1) the existing bund, which they (the Persians) now possess, is not advanced one yard into Afghan territory, and (2) the quantity of water, which is required for your side, shall not go to the other side.

I have often asked him to comeand pay ns another visit, and stay in our camp as our guest like he did in April 1903. He has taken this auspicious opportunity of availing himself of the invitation. , He paid me a visit in the afternoon, and read out the Amir’s letter.^ The Amir therein informs the Akhundzada that he is convinced all possible justice has been done to Afghan interests, and orders that the line defined in my award should be demarcated. The Amir refers to me as his “ revered friend ”. There is no indication whatever of any sense of disapproval in the letter, but the reverse, and the Akhundzada is greatly elated. He (the Akhundzada) says it affords good proof of his endeavours in all he has written to promote in the Amir’s mind increased friendship with, and confidence in, our Government. Personally, I am greatly relieved at this happy ending to a long business, for I know the risks which Afghan Commissioners incur, and have always done my best to prevent the Akhundzada’s friendship to us being requited by dis grace and misfortune. At the c ■nclusion of the letter, the Amir makes the first reference to the water question that he has yet made to his Commissioner. He writes, “with regard to the water question, about which nothing is said in the boundary award, take care that the present Persian bund is not moved one inch into Afghan territory, and that no water which now goes to Afguanistan is allowed to go to Persia ”. *#*«•** 7th November. I hear that the Yamin-i-Nizam visited the line of pillars between the Shelag and the Koh-i-Malik Siah. He took the opportunity of making a visit to Robat itself, which seems hardly called for, but, 1 presume, if asked why he did so. he would say that, from the boundary line at the southern foot of the Koh-i-Malik Siah, the shortest way to his camp at Divvan Chah was met Kobat and the north-east face of Koh-i-Malik Siah. As I expected, the Yamm has not visited the .boundary line through the waterless tract south of the Shelag. 8th November.

Enclosure No. 27. Colonel McMahon's draft Award “ B”, as revised with reference to the telegram from His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, dated the 19th December 1904, and the tele- gram to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, dated the 29th December 1904. Preliminary remarks. 1. General Sir Frederick Goldsmid, as Airbitrator between Peraia and Afghanistan, was called upon to settle the question of rights to land and wat of Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan. He delivered an arbitral award oT, oin t 9 in 1879 w hieh was confirmed by Her Majesty’s Secretary ot State for Cign Affai^and accepted by the Persian and Afghan Governments m 1873. . , . 2 At the time of the above award, the Helmand River had one mam distributary channel in S. istan, i. e., the Rud-i-Seistan, at the mouth of which, in order to divert sufficient water into this Rad, was a tamarisk hand known as the Band-i-Kohak or the Band-i-Seistan. The Kelmand River from thence, onwards, flowed in one channel past Nad Ali, and alon- what is now known as the Sikhsar, into the Naizar and Hamun. In 1896, ^ a large flood caused the river to burst out for itself a new main channel, which 1 tt the old one near Shah.ul, and is now known as the Rud-i-Pariun. 3. Various disputes regarding water between Persian and Afghan Seistan, which* were caused by changes in the course of canals and in the course ot the main river, have arisen since 1872. My enquiries show that these have, until recently, alwavs been mutually and amicably settled by the responsible o® ial s concerned on both sid«-s, i. e., the Governors of Seisian and Chakansur These officials, who thoroughly understood each other’s water requirements, have always shown great tact and skill in settling water disputes to the mutual satis faction of both countries. 4. Unfortunately, of recent years, whatever may have been the cause, and whether this was due*to the change in the course of the mam stream, or to more strained relations, the amicable settlement of water difficulties has been found to be no longer possible. A series of small, and in themselves ummpor - ant water questions arose between 1900 and 1902, which by reason of estrang ed r^lations^caused misunderstanding and increased ill-feeling, until matters were brought to a crisis by further disputes arising from abnormal deficiency of water in the Helmand in 1902. This led to the present reference to the arbitra tion of the British Government. 5 The condition under which the present arbitration has been agreed to by the Governments of Persia and Afghanistan, is that the award should be in accordance with the terms of Sir Prederick Goldsmid’s award. 6. In framing my award I am, therefore, restricted by the above Condi- 7, Sir Prederick Goldsmid’s award on the water question was as follows “ It is to be clearly understood that no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of irrigation on both banks of the Helmand Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for 1 oreign Affairs, in his capacity as the final confirming authority of that award, after consulting General Goldsmid, further laid down in 1873 that the above clause should not be understood to apply either to existing canals or to old or disused canals that it mav be desired to put in proper repair, nor would it interfere with the excavation of new canals, provided that the requisite supply on both banks is not diminished. . 8 The above award is so definite that it is unnecessary to make any attempt to define it further, except on one particular pokt. This award pro vides that- Persia has a right to a requisite supply of water for irrigation. In order to prevent future misunderstanding, it only remains to define what amount of water fairly represents a requisite supply for Persian requirements. 9 From the careful and exhaustive measurements, observations, and enquiries made by this Mission in Seistan, the following facts have been clearly established i*'' (a) Seistan suffers more from excess than deficiency of water. Par more loss is caused by damage done to land and crops, year after year, by floods, than is caused by want of water for irrigation. (h\ In onlv very few exceptional abnormal years of low river has any question of sufficiency of water arisen in Sehtm, and then Afghan Seistan has suffered enuallv with Persian Seistan. Moreover, questions as to the sufficiency ot water onlv prove serious when the spring cmp cultivation is concerned when the river is at its lowest, t.e., between the autumn and spring equinoxes, yet it has been tion.a til ascertained that only in 3 out of the past 35 years has deficiency of water in Seistan during that season, it is necessaiy, tneretore, first to coCider water requirements during the season of spring crops. Any settlement based on the requirements of that season will meet the case of the remainder of the year also. ^ 11 tt i ^ t&gt; • (cl After carefully calculating the normal volume of the Helmand River durin' the period between the autumn equinox and the spring equinox it has been dearly ascertained that one-third of the water winch now reaches Seistan at Bandar-f-Kamal Khan would amply suffice for the proper irrigation of all exiftffic cultivation in Persian Seistan, and also allow of a large future extension o^thatocultivation. This would also leave a requisite supply for all Afghan requirements. 10. I therefore give the following award : Award. • 1 No irrigation works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the river hut both sides have the right, within their own territories, to main- tain existing canals, to open out old or disused canals, and to make new canals from the Helmand River, provided that the supply of water requisite for irrigation on both sides is not diminished. 2 The amount of water requisite for irrigation of Persian lands irrigable from and below the Band-i-Kohak is one-third of the whole volume of the Helmand River which enters Seistan. Seistan, to which Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award applies, comprises all lands on both hanks of the Helmand from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan downwards. 3. Persia is, therefore, entitled to one-third of the whole Helmand River calculated at the point where water is first taken off from it to irrigate lands on either hank situated at or below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. 4. Any irrigation works constructed by Afghanistan to divert water into Seistan lands, as above defined, must allow of* at least one-third of the volume of the whole river being available for Persian use at Bandd-Kohak, 5. To enable both sides to satisfy themselves that this award is being complied with, and at,the same time to avoid the necessity of fresh references to the/ Government/ of India/ and the expense of special Missions, a British officer of irrigation experience shall he permanently attached to the Consulate at Seistan. He will be empowered to give an opinion, when required by either party, on any case of doubt or dispute over ’water questions that may arise. He will, when necessary, take steps to bring the real facts of any case to the notice of the Government concerned. He will be able also to call the attention of eitner party to any important indications of threatening danger to their water-supply arising from natural causes or their own irrigation works. To enable this officer properly to fulfil the functions of this office, free access shall he given to him by either side, to the Helmand River and its branches and the heads of canals leading therefrom. «* 6. The maintenance of the Band-i-Kohak is of great importance to the welfare of Persian Seistan. It is possible that the deepening of the river bed at and below the site of the present band may necessitate moving the band a short distance further up the river Afghanistan should allow Persia Jo move this hand, if necessary, and grant Persia the right to excavate the short canal required from such new band through Afghan territory to the Rud-i-Seistan. Similarly, should it become necessary for Afghanistan to move the present Shahgul band across the Rud-i-Pariun somewhat lower down that stream, Persia should (as has been done before) allow Afghanistan right of way for a canal through Persian territory from that band to the Nad Ali channel. 7. It will be noted that the rights to the Helmand water, which her geographical position naturally gives to Afghanis an as owner of the upper Helmand, have been restricted to the extent stated above in favour of Persia in raccordance with Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award. It follows, therefore, that Persia has no right to alienate to any other Power the water rights thus acquired without the consent of Afghanistan. 8. I cannot close this award without a word of warning to both countries concerned. The past history of the Helmand River in Seistan shows that it has always been subject to sudden and important changes in its course which have from time to time, diverted the whole river into a new channel, and rendered useless all the then existing canal systems. Such changes are liable to occur in the future, and great care should, therefore, be exercised m the opening out of new canals, or the enlargement of old canals leading from the Helmand. Unless this is done with proper precaution, it may cause the river to divert itself entirely at such points, and cause great loss to both countries. This danger applies equally to Afghanistan and Persia. Enclosure No. v8 . Extract Jromthr diary of Colonel A. E.

Went as far as Sur Daghal and back to Sena Rud, 44 miles, where I stayed the night. Nth November. —Inspected the pillars from Sena Rud to near Kohak, where the last ones are now being finished, and returned to main camp. 18th November, Camp Kohak. —The remaining pillars were finished to-day, and the boundary line from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Kohak is, at last, com pleted. 5 It has been a very difficult piece of work. The alignment of so long a straight line was rendered very difficult by the wind on some days, and by the heat haze, and mirage on others. The building of pillars necessitated careful arrangements, as all the water for the building parties and for the masonry had to be brought from long distances, 14 to 15 miles. The line is now well marked out by a splendid row of 51 massive masonry pillars in a dead straight line, which, in places, can be seen stretching away in -the far distance like a wall. Two stretches of heavy and high sandhills, one eight miles, and the other three miles, wide, did not permit of demarcation. Mr. Ward deserves great credit for the manner in which he has carried out a very arduous task. He and his building parties underwent considerable hardship during the 1^ months the work lasted.■w...

Keg-i-Mori is about U miles from J akht-i-Shah, and we are encamped here on the site of our camp of last February and March, on flat salt-covered low ground, on the shores of the Chung-i-Chahar Shahr. Owing to the Hamun being lower than last winter, the wide stretch of water alongside our camp is unfortunately too shallow for our boats, and the nearest water suitable for sailing is the Chung-i-Baringak, eight miles to the west of this.

These ruins, which are now merely low shapeless mounds cover ed with earth, cover a large extent of ground. Beneath a few inches of earth, one comes upon masses of burnt brick of all sizes in excellent preservation.

I rode out there in the evening with him, and visited the site he asked for, which is about 500 yards north-east of the spot fixed by me. # He was able to show the traces of water channels and cultivation where the turnips (shalgum), from which this place Shalgumi takes its name, had been grown. His ments were reasonable, and the difference of site immaterial, so I altered the piUar accordingly, but on the condition that no further questions are raised regarding demarcation onwards. I was anxious to get this settled as the iden tity of the Siah Koh admits of some question, and I hope now to hear no further discussion about the hill I have fixed upon for the end of our line. «»«»•** 7th December 1904, Camp Reg-i-Mori.—The building of boundary pillars up to Shalgumi was finished to-day, and the building parties rejoined mam camp to enjoy a well-earned rest during the Id holidays. Notwithstanding the fact that they have been strictly observing the Ramzan fast, the building parties have worked very hard from morning till night throughout the month. The pillars from Shahgul (Milok) to here are very fine imposing structures from 15 to 20 feet in height. 8th December 1904, Camp Reg-i-Mori.—l had hoped to have had by this time the sites for several pillars from Shalgumi onwards through the Naizar fixed, and to have had bricks collected at those sites, but unfortunately the weather all through the past week has been very thick, and the Siah Roh has never once been visible, so that visual alignment on it has been impossible. ******* Enclosure No. 32.

Yesterday, how ever, the weather cleared, and the sites of two or three boundary pillars were fixed. Building work recommenced to-day. 13th December. —The whole camp marched to Dahana Bud (22 miles) on the left bank of the Earrah Bud, close to where it enters the Hamun. The road across the Hamun, between Beg-i-Mori and the north hank, is now dry, and we had had a good road cut for us through the reed beds. I fixed the sites of several boundary pillars bringing the line nearly up to the east shore of the Hamun-i-Sabari. As the Hamun area actually along the boundary is now dry, I am building massive pucca masonry pillars. In ordinary years it would probably be impossible to build them, but when built they will doubtless last for an indefinite time. Our camp is situated in a picturesque spot, with the broad reed-fringed waters of the Hamun on one side beyond which the Bandan and other mountain ranges stand up well on the western horizon. In front, i.e., to the north, is a thick fringe of large handsome Padag trees (known both as Euphrates poplar and Babylonian willow) which thickly line both banks of the Earrah Bud. The Bud is now a deep channel about 100 yards wide, with a depth of 40 feet of standing water, stretching 10 miles up from the mouth. Above that point, the Bud is quite dry at this time of year, all the water being taken off by canals at Lash Juwain and upwards. Camp Dahana-i-Bud. 14th December —Pillar building is proceeding. We find an inexhaustible supply of large burnt bricks in the Peshawaran and other massive ruins, which are widely scattered over the country, north and east of this place. Enclosure No. 39.

The objections raised by the Yamin-i-Nizam were replied to verbally, and the matter was dropped. My object in replying as I did to his letter, was to assist him in meeting objections that may be made, by his ill-wishers, to the boundary settlement with which he has been connected. Translation of an official letter from the Yamin-i-Nizam, Persian Commissioner, to the British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, No. 21 A., dated the 22nd December 190t (Itth Shawal 1322 ). As the result of a tour which I have made during the last few days in the neighbourhood of the pillars erected on the northern boundary of Seistan, it is necessary that I should bring to your notice the following points The graziers (Gaodars) of this part of Seistan are generally aggrieved that, in consequence oi the erection of these pillars, their camping grounds have remained outside the (line of) pillars. Included amongst these are these very Gaodars and Saiyids’ houses which are less than two miles south of the (Mission) Camp and about one mile north of the line of pillars, and which have been for many years, and are still, in Seistani possession, and have always paid their revenue to Seistani officials. Ibis is a clear proof that this piece of land has been from of old, and still is, admittedly Persian territory. Again, the canal of Muhammad Darwesh Saruni, a Seistani subject, which takes off from the head of the Parrah Eud, and from which they cultivated the adjoining land in the time of Paiz Khan, and paid revenue to the Government of Seistan, is still existant and a proof of this claim. In short, the dwelling places and refuges of the Gaodars of this part of Seistan for the most part have been left opposite to and outside of, the line, and they are now no longer able to possess these camnin- places in the season of flood time, because it is not possible for them to dwell in another place which would be within the line selected by you. By the line, a fresh loss of revenue accrues to the Persian Government. Therefore, as I have repeatedly verbally urged, if the boundaiy line were to pass from Tappa Toaharan (Kharan) and near Tappa Musjid Kat and between the houses of the Lash Juwain Gaodars and of the Seistan Gaodars, which are situated to the south of the Mission Camp, opposite (parallel) to the Une which they at present possess, it would obviate most of these dithculties, and would be more in accordance with the spirit of the former arbitration, because looking westwards in prolongation of the present line of pillars the sXkA is visible north of Nar Ahn, and inasmuch as this present arbitration erection of pillars is for the sake of the removal ot disputes and for the tranquility of the people of both sides, I hope that in this matter you will give special attention to the representations contained in this letter. ■ Translation of a letter from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner Seistan Arbitration Commission, to the Persian Commissioner, No. 24, dated the 4th January 1905. After compliments .—Tour letter of 22nd December 1904 (14th Shawal 1 g‘2'21 reached me the night before I started for S.ah Koh, and as I had no time to answer it before leaving, I instructed my Assistant, Captain Eamsay, to call upon you. and explain verbally to you the reasons which made it impossible for me to agree to any alteration of the boundary line. _ It is hardly necessary for me to add anything to what Captain Ramsay has verbally told you, but I take this opportunity of acknowledging your letter, to Brin' one or two facts to your notice. The Afghan Commissioner and the Governor of Lash Juwain have been raisin- strong verbal objections to this very portion of the boundary line which vou contTd to be unfavourable to Persia. They claim that it leaves large portions of Naizar in which Afghan Gaodars graze their cattle, and it leaves manv nlaces where their Gaodars live during portion of the year lar within the PersFan sTde oT the boundary Une. I am of opinion that Persian Gaodars are no■ M n :i I ® i j ^ ( ! 42 more inconvenienced by the boundary line now demarcated than Afghans Gaod- ars are. Frontier cattle-owners and flock-owners (Gaodars and Maldais) often do overstep the border of their country, and this is specially so in cases where the boundary is not clearly defined. As for the Muhammad Darwesh you mention, you are doubtless unware that he is really an subject, and the Governor of Lash Juwain says he obtained the land referred to as such. However, be that as it may, I must recall to your recollection the wording of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s award, i. e., “ north of Seistan the southern limit of the Naizar should be the frontier toward Lash Juwain. Persia should not cross the Hamun in that direction. A line from the Naizar to the Siah Koh near Bandan would clearly define her possession”. I have, in my award, interpreted the above words in the most favourable possible manner for Persia and have done all I possibly could, short of disregard ing Afghan rights, to meet your wishes. It is not possible to draw the line from Shalghumi to Siah Koh any further north without infringing General Goldsmid’s award, and bringing the Persian boundary on to the mainland north of the Hamun and across a portion of the Lash Juwain District. Again, as regards the Siah Koh itself, I have interpreted General Goldsmid’s award in a manner very favourable to Persia. ^ Of the hills that might be called Siah Koh, I decided upon Nar Ahu, which is the hill shown as Siah Koh in my award map, instead of a hill several miles nearer Bandan. It was even open to question whether General Goldsmid’s definition cpuk* not apply to Koh-i-Bandan itself. You will, I think, admit that in this I have gone far to meet your wishes, and a large tract of country has been brought within Persian territory which, with a less favourable interpretation of General Goldsmid’s award, might have been included in Afghanistan. You will also remember that, from Tappa-i-Tilai to Shalghumi, a consider able tract of good land has been included in Persian territory which might, by a less favourable interpretation of General Goldsmid’s award, have been included in Afghan territory. Now, however, that the boundary defined by my award has been finally accepted by both the Persian and Afghan Governments, it is out of my power to alter it in any respect. I have accordingly demarcated with boundary pillars a line in strict accordance with that award. Far from having grounds for objecting to this boundary line, you must yourself admit that you have good reasons for congratulating yourself on the result of your efforts on behalf of the interests of your Government. These have been successful in several places as above noted, and I know of no place on the boundary line where the just rights of Persia have suffered.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 16th February 1904. 9th Februray 1904, Camp Gul ,SM.—Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah had a long interview with the Akhundzada last night. He ascertained that the Amir has written to acknowledge the receipt of my award, and has sent a number of questions for the Akhundzada to answer, together with a rough map showing the discrepancy between the boundary line in General Goldsmid’s map and in my award. He*asks whether villages shown in the tract between those two lines have been up to now paying revenue to Persia or Afghanistan. II e as ks similar questions regarding supposed villages in the Tarakun tract. These questions show an absence of knowledge of Seistan, and its past or modern history. The Amir does not appear to have expressed any disapproval of the Akhundzada’s conduct of affairs. This is very satisfactory, and the1 i Mmmfmmma* * — 3 letter may, as stated by the Akhundzada, be taken as merely a pretext to delay acceptance of the award for a period becoming to Afghan dignity. There would appear to be nothing in the letter which would account for the Akhundzada’s recent depressed spirits. This is now explained by the reports, which he hears have been made, to his prejudice, to the Amir, from various sources. Musa Khan, it will be remembered, took French leave and returned to his home at Herat some two months ago. His real reason was to safeguard his own interests in the division of a deceased relative’s property. To excuse himself, like an Afghan, he gave out that be had not been able to longer tolerate the Akbund- zada’s management of boundary negotiations, and his absolute submissiveness to me. He sent a mendacious report to this effect to the Amir. Kazi Saad- ud-din Khan, Governor of Herat, who is no friend of the Akhundzada, willingly accepted Musa Khan’s version and also sent a report to the Amir. The Com- mander-in-Chief of Herat, however, the worthy old General Firamoz Khan, refused to accept Musa Khan’s statements and, after roundly abusing him in public, has ordered him to go back to Seistan. Needless to say, these reports, which have come to his knowledge, have disquieted the old Akhundzada some what. From what Mir Shams Shah could gather of the tenor of the Amir’s letter, it proved what to me is very gratifying, i.e., that the Akhundzada had in his own letters to the Amir warmly approved of my boundary line. The Akhund zada is able easily to dispose of the Amir’s questions, and the answers are all in favour of my award. I am glad to say this obviates the necessity I feared, of opening up with the Akhundzada the old discussions on the boundary question. The Amir’s letter has taken some 35 days in coming. Both the Amir and the Akhundzada have written to Kandahar, complaining of the present slow running of the postal line. ******* Enclosure No. 8. Extract from the Diary of Colonel A. II.

It is advisable to keep the Afghans aware that the blame for present delay rests entirely with them. The old Akhundzada desired an interview with me to-day in order to explain that no blame rests on himself personally, and that he has done his best to get the matter settled up.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 24th February 1904. 17th February 1904, Camp Gul Shah .—The Akhundzada has made several complaints to me lately of assaults and robberies committed by Persian thieves across the border. I always pass them on to the Yamin-i-Nizam, who generally manages to produce counter-charges of a similar character. There is good ground for believing, however, that a gang of bad characters belonging to Persian territory are trying to annoy the Afghans. It is not impossible that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk is trying an old game which has helped him often in the past, whenever he has been summoned to Tehran. All he had to do was to show that the state of the border prevented his leaving SeistanWith this Mission, however, and other independent evidence on the spot, this stratagem does not now promise much success.4 24th February, Camp Feg Mori .—I bear that Yakubak, one of tbe two most famous thieves in Persian Seistan, and who has been active lately on the Afghan border, has been killed by some sowars, who attacked him m lus bouse a few nights ago. I expect tbe Afghans bad a band in this. * * * * * Enclosure No. 10. Translation of a letter from His Highness the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.M.G., to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, No. 52, dated the 2Hth Zilhaj 1321 H., corre sponding to the 16th March 1904). After compliments.—I have received Your Excellency’s two friendly letters, dated the 22nd November 1903 and loth February 1904, regarding the Naizar case, and have understood all their contents. The delay which occurred in writing and sending reply to Your Excel- lencv’s first letter was due to the reports which I received from time to time from Akbundzada Fakir Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Musa Khan, whom I bad appointed for tbe settlement of the said business, to the effect that Colonel McMahon bad not secured the rights of the subjects of the Afghan Government, but that be left their lands to the people of Seistan. I myself have also compared the map prepared by Colonel McMahon with the one sent by Your Excellency, viz., the map prepared by Goldsmid, and I find that there is a difference of 176 square miles between tbe map of Colonel McMahon and that of Goldsmid. As I have made it my duty to consider tbe slightest alteration in the portions of the frontiers of the territory of Afghanistan, to which I succeeded on the death of His Highness the late Zia-ul-millat-wad-din, as a matter of dishonour and disgrace for my Government, so far as possible, 1 will not consent to any such breach and loss. I have therefore devoted much thought to this matter. I have also made necessary enquiries from my officers; and I find that the cession of this land on these frontiers should not he considered to emanate from Colonel McMahon, nor can the cause be attributed to him. On the contrary, it is the result of Afghan ne'lect; for, when the boundary was settled by General Goldsmid, the Afghans should have erected proper marks and boundary pillars in accordance with the line drawn on the map prepared by General Goldsmid, so that future disputes or quarrels regarding the limits might be obviated ; and their respective limits would he recognised by the people on both sides; nor would either side have made any encroachments. Again, if the Afghan Government neglected to erect boundary marks, it was their duty to have occupied their lands up to the boundary line. The position has been reversed, and Persian subjects have taken possession of the said frontiers and have occupied them. If Colonel McMahon, in consideration of the relations of friendship and unity between the illustrious Government and the Government of Afghanistan, had attemped to secure the rights of the subjects of Afghanistan, and had adhered to the settlement of the map prepared by Goldsmid, which it was necessary for him to do, the Persian Government (who consider the territory their own, as it has been occupied by their subjects) no doubt would have referred the matter to an arbitrator from the Russian Government. If a Russian officer had gained a footing, and Colonel McMahon had adhered firmly to the Goldsmid map, the Russian officer would have purposely magnified matters immensely; and if Colonel McMahon had conceded the point, this would have added to the ignorance of the Persians, who would have considered Russia as their well-wisher; and owing to a slight benefit which they had gained through the intercession of the Russian arbi trator, they would have consented to the extension of Russian influences in their country more than before. In the circumstances, I am sincerely ready to applaud the discretion of Colonel McMahon, and to make no complaints regarding his action. * Amir Habib.ulla Khan.Although the Afghan Government had formerly laid claim to the whole of Seistan, and Goldsmid, who had been appointed for the settlement of the said dispute, settled the claims of both sides, giving satisfaction to them by means of this very map, yet, now that Colonel McMahon has acted in this manner, giving the said frontier districts to the Persians contrary to the former settlement, I attribute this concession to the neglect which the Afghan Government committed at the time when Goldsmid laid down the boundary, and I praise Colonel McMahon’s opinion and action. No doubt, Your Excellency will also issue necessary instructions to him not to trouble himself to stay further in that part of the country, and to return safely to his own duties. But it is my opinion that now also no boundary pillars should be erected on that frontier, just as no boundary pillars were erected at the time of General Goldsmid’s settlement. My reasons are that the Russian Government has commenced to act in such a way on the frontier of Herat, viz., that they fraudulently induce the people of Herat, who go to their country to earn their livelihood, to sell their lands to them. In view of this trickery of the Russians, the time is near when the relations between Russia and Afghanistan will become disturbed and strained, and the matter will end in hostilities. This may occur before the expiration of two years ; and it may so happen that either the Almighty God will be pleased to preserve the Afghan Govern ment from disgrace, or the said Government will suffer destruction. In these circumstances, what good would result from the erection of boundary pillars on the frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan ? If the Almighty were to grant Afghanistan the position which the Afghans wash and desire, since the Persians have noi been ashamed, with the encouragement of the Russians, to reject after thirty years the boundary line laid down by Goldsmid, the Afghan Government also without any hesitation will resume and continue to urge their claim to Persian Seistan. Eurther, I hope that Your Excellency will be pleased to send orders to Colonel McMahon not to use such words and expressions in his award as may be considered to make the award final and perpetual. Eurther, all is well. Enclosure No. 11. Telegram, No. 13 IS F.-B., dated the 31st March 1904. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To Hi s Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. The Amir has answered my letters of the 22nd November 1903 and 15th Eebruary 1904 about the Seistan boundary. He explains that the delay was caused by the necessity for making local references, and accepts Colonel McMahon’s award, though it involves the loss of 176 square miles, on ground that the Afghans ought to have erected boundary pillars in accordance with Colonel Goldsmid’s line and occupied up to it. If Colonel McMahon had persisted however the Persians would have called on the Russians who would have gained influence from ultimate concession of Colonel McMahon. Latter therefore, acted with discretion. Above passage has rather ironical appearance. The Amir then asks me to instruct Colonel McMahon not to stay further in Seistan, but to return to India. He deprecates erection of any boundary pillars, because Colonel Goldsmid erected none, and because of his experience of Russian trickery on the Herat border where Afghans have been persuaded to mortgage lands to Russians. This he thinks will end in hostilities with Russia before two years. If Afghanistan is destroyed, what good would pillars be ? If Afghans win, they will resume lands forfeited bv awmrd. He, therefore, hopes Colonel McMahon will not use words describing his award as final and perpetual. Ends. It is of course impossible for Colonel McMahon to leave without demarcating boundary. Eurther, the Amir has forgotten that irrigation questions mentioned in my letter to him of the 24th November have not been settled. The Persian Government attached more importance to these than to the boundary.I propose to reply briefly that I am glad the Amir accepts the aware, a d that I P wfll order Colonel McMahon to return as soon as he has carried out the above objects which are necessary to prevent renewal of disputes.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—His Highness the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.M.G. My honoured and esteemed Friend, I have received Your Highness’s friendly letter of 16th March concerning the Seistan Boundary. I am glad that Your Highness accepts the^ award of Colonel McMahon, since I am convinced that it will be beneficial to the interests of your Government and people. It will now he necessary for Colonel McMahon to proceed to erect the boundary pillars. I observe that Your Highness does not think that they will he required. But I would point out that for the British Government to lay down a boundary between the territories of Afghanistan and Persia, and then to place no pillars upon it, would be to throw away the entire benefits of their action, and to provoke a renewal of disputes at a later date. Moreover, the Persian Government will, with reason, expect the pillars to he erected. I, therefore, trust that Your Highness will issue immediate orders to your officials in this sense. I am confident that Your Highness will agree with these proposals, because in the same letter you have said that the Afghans ought to have erected boundary pillars at the time of Colonel Goldsmid’s award, and that the recent difficulties have arisen because they failed to do so. Colonel McMahon will also require to pronounce upon the irrigation questions in dispute between the subjects of Your Highness and those of the Persian Government. These were one of the chief causes of the Mission, and it is necessary, in the interests of future peace and tranquillity on the border, that they should he authoritatively arranged, in my letter to you of 22nd November last, I reminded Your Highness that this was a part of Colonel McMahon’s duty. When he has successfully carried out his instructions in both these respects, I will order Colonel McMahon to return to India. * Amir Habibulla Kl.an.Enclosure No. 15.

On ground that Afghans ought to have erected pillars in accordance with Goldsmid’s line and occupied up to it, he accepts McMahon’s award, though it involves loss of 176 square miles. He asks Viceroy to instruct McMahon to return now to India. He deprecates erection of any boundary pillars because Goldsmid erected none, and because of his experience of Russian trickery on the Herat border, which lie thinks before two years will end in hostilities with Russia. He asks what good pillars would be if Afghanistan is destroyed. If Afghan istan wins, they will resume lands forfeited by award. He, therefore, hopes McMahon will not use words describing his award as perpetual and final. Reply was sent to the Amir with the concurrence of the Secretary of State on 13th April, expressing pleasure at his acceptance of award, and saying that it will be necessary for Colonel McMahon to erect boundary pillars and to pronounce upon irrigation questions in dispute, and that McMahon will be ordered to return to India when his instructions in both these respects have been successfully carried out.

Salgumi, Tappas Kurki, Sharaki, and Talai are all visible, one from the other. The low-lying areas m between each of these points is all dense reeds and, in places, water. It is not, even now, possible to huild other boundary pillars between the above, nor would this be necessary. The weather now for many days has been stormy, and, doubtless, hea'vy rains have fallen in the higher catchment areas of the Helmand, Khash, and Earrah Ends, as all these rivers are now in flood. As soon as these floods go down, the rivers will rapidly commence their annual rise from melting snow, &amp;c. Ve have stayed in Mian Kangi as long as it is safe to do so. I have stayed on till now in the hope of doing some demarcation work, but kept a careful eye on the rivers behind us. Even when these temporary floods subside, the Rud-i-Pariun will now onwards only be fordable for camels at one place, near Khamak. The Band-i-Seistan, which for a long time now has been badly breached, was partly carried away this week, and the volumes cf the Bud-i-Seistan, and Pariun, have decreased and increased, respectively, m consequence.

When Takht-i-Shah had once, according to General Goldsmith’s map, been included in his dominions, it was a dishonour to him to give it up.

After compliments .—I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that as regards the Naizar case, I gave in my letter, dated the 16th March 1904, full particulars, and stated that the settlement of the case was conditional on certain matters. Your Excellency has supported the letter of His Excellency Lord Curzon, dated the 13th April 1904, and without attending to the wording and purport of my said friendly letter, Your Excellency has made use of words which are not mentioned in it. This has caused me regret. My friend, I was ready not to depart in any way from the decision and settlement of General Goldsmid, and not to allow' a piece of land from the boundary under dispute, whiph had been laid down in the map by General Goldsmid, to be taken by the Persians. In my above-mentioned letter I communicated to Lord Curzon my ideas and views on this subject, stating that I intended to renew my claim against the Persians hereafter, and, therefore, it was necessary that no boundary marks and pillars should be erected on that boundary ; and that no language should be used in the arbitration given by Colonel McMahon, which, on my renewing my claim, might become a sufficient “ Sanad” to the Persians. But in view of the relations of friendship and union existing between the illustrious British Government and the God-granted Government, I feel certain that in the same way that I consider the illustrious British Government and the Government of Afghanistan as sharers of benefits and losses in such external political affairs, Your Excellency will also consider the benefits resulting to the Government of Afghanistan as being benefits accruing to the illustrious Government, and, as far as possible, will not allow the benefits of Afghanistan to be lost. Your Excellency and Lord Curzon insist that the settlement of this matter should be made according to the wishes of the Persians, and that the settlement nf Tnldsmid which, according to Lord Curzon’s own letter, had been accepted and approved for so many years, should be laid aside. Although the high officials of the exalted Government of India have not clearly informed me of thp benefits which they have in their mind in this matter, and I have not understood what the Government of India find to be beneficial to Afghan istan in such a concession, and in the permanence of such a settlement and the renewal of boundary demarcation, yet as I adhere to this my idea that the hieh officials of the exalted Government of India will not allow the benefits of AfUanistan to be lost, and that in such a concession, they have in view the benefits of both the exalted Governments, 1 have, therefore, given up what 1 had in my mind about this matter, and I now give my consent to the jke. C12 Rpftlement and arbitration of Colonel McMahon which I had before approved under certain conditions, and I accept the distribution ot the said frontier according to Colonel McMahon’s proposal. , But as I find the word irrigation both in Your Excellency s and Lord Curzon’s letter, I desire to know~the details about this irrigation, as regards its nature and extent.

Following sent to Hardinge, 1st September :— Begins. Your telegram, 29th August. Afghans have made small temporary bund as reported, which diverts only one hundredth part of river, and in no way affects Persian supply at Kuhak bund. I may note Persians have only now just begun to commence annual reconstruction of said bund. Yamin brought Afghan bund officially to my notice at the request of the Persian Government, to whom, I understand, Russians have, as usual, given exaggerated report. Matter is very trifling, and I have told Yamin that I am not going to be drawn into any discussion on this or other water questions until demarcation is finished, and I am ready to tackle water award. Addressed to Hardinge ; repeated to Government of India. Enclosure No. 36. Extract from the diary of Colonel A. II.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner for Seistan Arbitration Commission, Seistan, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Your telegram 3412 E.-B. Persian claims regarding water are, as you know, extremely vague, and only irrigation question raised is their attempt to prevent Afghans being allowed to do anything, above, which will decrease i volume of Helmand at Kohak bund. This might be defined in reply to Amir’s question as an attempt to obtain a more definitely worded interpretation of Goldsmid’s award, thereby ensuring for Persian Seistan a sufficient supply of water, in case future changes in course of river upset present conditions. This is equally advisable in Afghan interests, as the river might at any time change its course like it has done so often in the past, and perhaps some day send whole river into Persian Seistan. I would suggest, in reply to Amir, your quoting paragraph of Goldsmid’s award relating to water, and telling him that Persian Government have been informed that water question will not be taken up until demarcation is finished : he should, therefore, if he has not already done so, send early authority to his Afghan Commissioner to assist demarcation. I am somewhat afraid that he may delay doing this on pretext of getting full information about water question. He may rest assured that Afghan interests will be carefully guarded. My draft water award is well in hand. It presents great difficulties, and submission must necessarily be a little delayed, but I will send it as soon as possible. Enclosure No. 38.

My honoured and esteemed Eriend, ^ I have to thank Your Highness for your letter of the 2nd Jamadi-us-Sani, 1322 H., corresponding to the 14th August 1904, regarding the settlement effected by Colonel McMahon of the boundary dispute in Seistan. I am glad to learn that Your Highness, in view of the relations of friend ship and union existing between our two Governments, has been able to accept Colonel McMahon’s award, and has agreed to his proceeding with the work of demarcation. I can assure Your Highness that the rights of Afghanistan have been very fully considered, and that the settlement is one which You Highness will, in future, be able to regard as highly satisfactory to the interests of your country. Your Highness asks me what are the nature and extent of the iirigation question with which Colonel McMahon has yet to deal. Your Highness will recognise that without a definite decision regarding the water rights, which were the primary cause of the dispute which led to the appointment of t e Arbitration Commission, the mere settlement of the land frontier would be of little avail to prevent future friction and trouble. It is very necessary m the interest of both Afghans and Persians to decide how a requisite supp y of water from the Helmand can be assured to both parties, as contemplated by General Goldsmid’s arbitral opinion which did not enter into detail, but merely laid down in general terms that “ no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the Helmand ”. A clearer definition of the arrangement is especially necessary in the case of Afghanistan, owing to the possibility of the river ehanainff its course and being diverted entirely into Persian Seistan.

After compliments .—I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that as regards the Naizar case, I gave in my letter, dated the 16th March 1901, full particulars, and stated that the settlement of the case was conditional on certain matters. i Your Excellency has supported the letter of His Excellency Lord Curzon, dated the 13th April 1901, and without attending to the wording and purport of my said friendly letter, Your Excellency has made use of words which are not mentioned in it. This has caused me regret. My friend, I was ready not to depart in any way from the decision and settlement of General Goldsmid, and not to allow a piece of land from the boundary under dispute, which had been laid down in the map by General Goldsmid, to he taken by the Persians. In my above-mentioned letter I communicated to Lord Curzon my ideas and views on this subject, stating that I intended to renew my claim against the Persians hereafter, and, therefore, it was necessary that no boundary marks and pillars should be erected on that boundary ; and that no language should be used in the arbitration given by Colonel McMahon, which, on my renewing my claim, might become a sufficient “ Sanad” to the Persians. But in view of the relations of friendship and union existing between the illustrious British Government and the God-granted Government, I feel certain that in the same way that I consider the illustrious British Government and the Government of Afghanistan as sharers of benefits and losses in such external political affairs, Your Excellency will also consider the benefits resulting to the Government of Afghanistan as being benefits accruing to the illustrious Government, and, as far as possible, will not allow the benefits of Afghanistan to be lost. Your Excellency and Lord Curzon insist that the settlement of this matter should he made according to the wishes of the Persians, and that the settlement of Goldsmid, which, according to Lord Curzon’s own letter, had been accepted and approved for so many years, should he laid aside. Although the high officials of the exalted Government of India have not clearly informed me of the benefits which they have in their mind in this matter, and I have not understood what the Government of India find to he beneficial to Afghan istan in such a concession, and in the permanence of such a settlement and the renewal of boundary demarcation, yet as I adhere to this my idea that the , high officials of the exalted Government of India will not allow the benefits of Afghanistan to be lost, and that in such a concession, they have in view the benefits of both the exalted Governments, I have, therefore, given up what I had in my mind about this matter, and I now give my consent to the settlement and arbitration of Colonel McMahon, which I had before approved under certain conditions, and I accept the distribution of the said frontier according to Colonel McMahon’s proposal. But as I find the word irrigation both in Your Excellency’s and Lord Curzon’s letter, I desire to knowlhe details about this irrigation, as regards its nature and extent. Eurther, all is well. * Amir Habibulla Khan. Foreign Office Press—No. 1002—31-8'04—o'!.From Viceroy, \.2&gt;th September 1904 . {Repeated to Sir A.

My telegram of the 2nd instant. dated the 6lh September, was received on the 1th from MacMahon the effect that authority to co-operate in demarcation had not reached Afghan Commissioner. MacMahon expressed a fear that Amir on pretext that he is awaiting information as to water rights, may defer giving requisite authority to his Commissioner. This does not seem to be improbable. I m accordingly addressing Amir, ashing him if he has not already sent Afghan Commissioner authority to co-operate in delimitation, to do so at an early date.

O., dated Simla, the 22nd June 1904. From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—His Highness the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.M.G, My honoured and esteemed Friend, On the 13th April 1904, Lord Curzon wrote to Your Highness, expressing a hope that Your Highness would issue immediate orders to your officials to co-operate with Colonel McMahon in demarcating, by pillars, the Seistan boundary line in accordance with Colonel McMahon’s award, which has been accepted by Your Highness and by the Persian Government. No reply to this communication has yet been received, and valuable time is being lost. There is still much work to be done in regard to the settlement of the water-dispute after the boundary pillars have been erected. Lord Curzon has already explained to Your Highness the necessity for marking the line by pillars, which will leave no room for doubt in the minds of the local people as to what tracts belong to Your Highness and what to Persia. I have since heard from Colonel McMahon that the Persian Com missioner has protested to him .against Your Highness’s officials taking revenue, until demarcation is finished, on lands cultivated by Persians near Alijangi and included in Afghan territory by Colonel McMahon’s award. This attitude on the part of the Persian Commissioner is hardly warrantable, and Colonel McMahon has replied accordingly; but the incident affords an additional argument in favour of the early construction of boundary pillars, and I trust that I shall soon hear that Your Highness has withdrawn your objection to the demarcation proposals. * Amir Habibulla Khan.19 Telegram, No. 624, dated Seistan, the Ifcth (despatched from From— Colonel A. H McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. ^Your telegram No. 1351 E.-B. of 4th April. After carefully reading Amir’s letter, I consider that it expresses far stronger approval of my award than I had expected from an Afghan Amir. His comparison of Goldsmid’s line and mine has, I know, been arrived at by drawing line westward to Siahkuh from point where Nadali channel cuts a straight line drawn between Kila Kang and Jalalabad, as erroneously shown in Goldsmid’s map. Latter portion of Amir’s letter can, I think, have no other interpretation but desire of Amir not to be fettered by demarcated line and permanent award should Russian entanglement in Far East give Afghans an opening, on no matter what pretext, for paying off old scores against Persia and Russia. If this supposition be correct, it will be very difficult to persuade Amir to consent to demarcation, and trouble may soon arise because Persians object to Afghans entering upon actual occupation of certain lands near Siksar,'recently culti vated by the Persians and now included inside Afghan line until that line has been definitely demarcated. Amir appears to have no copy of Goldsmid’s award, and, if you approve, I will send him one indirectly through Afghan Commissioner in order to give him more information regarding the origin of the claims of Afghanistan and Persia than he appears to have at present. 20 Telegram, No. 1640 F.-B., dated the 23rd April 1904.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—His Highness the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.M.G. 15 My honoured and esteemed Friend, I have received Your Highness’s friendly letter of 16th March concerning the Seistan Boundary. I am glad that Your Highness accepts the award of Colonel McMahon, since I am convinced that it will be beneficial to the interests of your Government and people. It will now he necessary for Colonel McMahon to proceed to erect the boundary pillars. I observe that Your Highness does not think that they will be required. But I would point out that for the British Government to lay down a boundary between the territories of Afghanistan and Persia, and then to place no pillars upon it, would be to throw away the entire benefits of their action, and to provoke a renewal of disputes at a later date. Moreover, the Persian Government will, with reason, expect the pillars to be erected. ^ I, therefore, trust that Your Highness will issue immediate orders to your officials in this sense. I am confident that Your Highness will agree with these proposals, because in the same letter you have said that the Afghans ought to have erected boundary pillars at the time of Colonel Goldsmid’s award, and that the recent difficulties have arisen because they failed to do so. Colonel McMahon will also require to pronounce upon the irrigation questions in dispute between the subjects of Your Highness and those of the Persian Government. These were one of the chief causes of the Mission, and it is necessary, in the interests of future peace and tranquillity on the border, that they should be authoritatively arranged, in my letter to you of 22nd November last, I reminded Your Highness that this was a part of Colonel McMahon’s duty. When he has successfully carried out his instructions in both these respects, I will order Colonel McMahon to return to India. 15a No. 1556 F.-B., dated Simla, the 19th April 1904 (Confidential).

The delay which occurred in writing and sending a reply to Your Excel lency’s first letter was due to the reports which I received from time to time from Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad Khan and Muhammad Musa Khan, whom I had appointed for the settlement of the said business, to the effect that Colonel McMahon had not secured the rights of the subjects of the Afghan Government, but that he left their lands to the people of Seistan. I myself have also compared the map prepared by Colonel McMahon with the one sent by Your Excellency, viz. % the map prepared by Goldsmid, and I find that there is a difference of 176 square miles between the map of Colonel McMahon and that of Goldsmid. As I have made it my duty to consider the slightest alteration in the portions of the frontiers of the territory of Afghanistan, to which I succeeded on the death of His Highness the late Zia-ul-millat-wad-din, as a matter of dishonour and disgrace for my Government, so far as possible, I will not consent to any such breach and loss. I have therefore devoted much thought to this matter. I have also made necessary enquiries from my officers; and 1 find that the cession of this land on these frontiers should not be considered to emanate from Colonel McMahon, nor can the cause be attributed to him. On the contrary, it is the result of Afghan neglect; for, when the boundary was settled by General Goldsmid, the Afghans should have erected proper marks and boundary pillars in accordance with the line dra^ n on the map prepared by General Goldsmid, so that future disputes or quarrels regarding the limits might be obviated; and their respec tive limits would be recognised by the people on both sides; nor would either side have made any encroachments. Again, if the Afghan Government neglected to erect boundary marks, it was their duty to have occupied their lands up to the boundary line. The position has been reversed, and Persian subjects have taken possession of the said frontiers and have occupied them. If Colonel McMahon, in consideration of the relations of friendship and unity between the illustrious Government and the Government of Afghanistan, had attempted to secure the rights of the subjects of Afghanistan, and had adhered to the settlement of the map prepared by Goldsmid, which it was necessary for him to do, the Persian Government (who consider the territory their own, as it has been occupied by their subjects) no doubt would have referred the matter to an arbitrator from the Russian Government. If a Russian officer had gained a footing and Colonel McMahon had adhered firmly to the Goldsmid map, the Russian officer would have purposely magnified matters immensely; and it Golone McMahon had conceded the point, this would have added to the ignorance of the Persians, who would have considered Russia as their well-wishei, and to a slight benefit which they had gained through the intercession ot the Russian arbitrator, they would have consented to the extension o ussian influences in their country more than before. In the circums ances, am sincerely ready to applaud the discretion of Colonel McMahon, an o ma e no complaints regarding his action Although the Afghan Government had formerly laid claim to the whole of Seistan, and Goldsmid, who had been appointed for the settlement ottbe said dispute, settled the claims of both sides, giving satis ac ion y means of this very map, yet, now that Colonel McMahon has ac e this * Amir Hubibullai \ i M fl I i p \ manner 'ivin; Hie said frontier districts to the Persians contrary to th' former settlement 1 attribute this concession to the neglect winch the Afghan Government committed at the time when Goldsmid laid down the boundary, and I praise Colonel McMahon’s opinion and action No doubt Your Excellency will also issue necessary instructions to him not to trouble himself to stay further in that part of the country, and to return safely to his own duties. But it is ray opinion that now also no boundary pillars should be erected on that frontier, just as no boundary pillars were erected at the time of General Goldsmid’s settlement. My reasons are that the Bussian Government has commenced to act in such a way on the frontier of Herat, viz., that they fraudulently induce the people of Herat, who go to their country to earn their livelihood, to sell their lands to them. In view of this trickery of the Russians, the time is near when the relations between Russia and Afghanistan will become disturbed and strained, and the matter will end in hostilities. This may occur before the expiration of two years; and it may so happen that either the Almighty God will be pleased to preserve the Afghan Govern- ment from disgrace, or the said Government wall suffer destruction. In these circumstances, what good would result from the erection of boundary pillars on the frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan ? If the Almighty were to grant Afghanistan the position which the Afghans wish and desire, since the Persians have not been ashamed, with the encouragement of the Russians, to reject after thirty years the boundary line laid down by Goldsmid, the Afghan Government also without any hesitation will resume and continue to urge their claim to Persian Seistan. Further, I hope that Your Excellency will be pleased to send orders to Colonel McMahon not to use such words and expressions in his award as may be considered to make the aw ard final and perpetual. Further, all is well. IfFrom Viceroy, 31s£ March 1904. p -Seistan Boundary. I have received from Amir reply to my letters nfWnd November 1903 and \hth February last, on this subject. After explaining delay as having been caused by references to local officials, Amir intimates 9 in a passage which sounds somewhat ironical, that, although it involves ’loss of 176 square miles, he accepts Mac Mahon s award on the around that the Afghans ought to have marked * ounda 2™ % }^ Mars and occupied up to them; if, however, MacMahon had persisted, the ^Russians would have been called in by the Persians, and MacMahon would ultimately have made concessions which would have added to Russian influence; MacMahon's action therefore was discreet. Mis highness proceeds to request that instructions to stay no longer in Seistan, but to return to India, may be sent to MacMahon. Amir deprecates erection of any boundary pillars, partly on the ground that Ooldsmid did not erect any, but also in consequence of his experience on Merat border of Russian trickery where Afghans have been persuaded by Russians to mortgage their lands. Before two years are over, he thinks, this will cause a war with Russia. What good would pillars be ij Afghanistan is destroyed ? In the event oj Afghans winning, lands forfeited by award will be resumed by them. In these circumstances he hopes that words describing his award as final and perpetual will not be used by MacMahon. {Abstract ends.) MacMahon, of course, cannot leave until he has demarcated the boundary. Amir has, moreover, forgotten that irrigation questions which were mentioned to him in my letter of 24*th November have not yet been settled. More importance is attached to these than to question of boundary by Persian Government. I propose to send brief reply to Amir saying that I am glad that he accepts the award, and that MacMahon will be ordered to return as soon as he has carried out the above objects which are necessary to prevent renewal of dispute. ^ u fo. a AM 0^^ ^ /S ^ From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 4^ April 1904.

They state that from enquiries made it appears that the Akhundzada had personally collected and despatched 300 armed men under 35 Kadkhudas to the place in question, who unprovokedly attacked some 10 or 12 Persians who held their ground and fired, whereupon the Afghans fled. It is gratifying to learn that the race of Rustam has not yet died out in Seistan, but other statements in the letter, as regards present possession and locality, make me unwillingly to attribute to the Persian Commissioners a surprising misunderstanding of the existing conditions of the locality as we ourselves both saw them. I am astonished to find no protest against my order or my authority for giving such order in their letter. * sfc * * ^ * The Hashmat-ul-Mulk has also told Mr. Dobbs that Mr, Miller has just warned him not to expect any fair treatment from the Mission, as we have made a bargain with the Afghans to give them Takht - i*Shah and other portions of Seistan, and, in return, take over south of the Helmand ourselves ! Mr. Dobbs endeavoured to show the Governor how absurd this was, but the Hashmat-ul*Mulk was evidently inclined to believe it. ***** 28th June, Camp Kohak.—Mx. Dobbs left in the early morning. I am sending Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh for a time to the city to assist the Consulate staff. I hear to-day from trustworthy sources that the Katkhudas and Mushrifs l(crop assessors) have received secret orders to prevent the sale of supplies to the Mission. These men are all under the Governor^ and such orders must have emanated from him. Native Attache, Kazi iakir Ahmed, 4228 F. D. Ends.has returned from Mianhangi, and reports the results of enquiries made by him into the recent fracas between Persians and Afghans. He heard the state- ments of the headmen of the Afghan and Persian villages concerned. The facts of the case appear to he that, on the 9th June, a party of Afghans proceeded to the spot where the tail of the Shela-i-Shamshiri (which is now filled with flood water) crosses the dry bed of the Sikhsar, near Deh Ali Jan»i and were making a small bund there to divert the water into the Sikhsar channel. The Persians, who had sown some crops last spring to the east of the Sikhsar at this point, regarding which the Akhundzadacomplained tome at the time, came up and tried to stop them. One of the Afghans fired a shot gun, but without hitting any one. The Persians then fired, and three Afghans were slightly wounded with shot pellets and one horse was killed. The Persians bolted, and the Afghans, whose headmen have very strict orders from the Akhundzada not to use force, made no attempt to retaliate. A few nights later the Persians came and damaged some of their own unripe corps above- mentioned with swords, evidently in order to lay the blame on the Afghans. It will be noticed that the crops over which this dispute arose are on land which, by the Persian Commissioners’ own admission, is in Afghan territory, t.e., on the east of the dry bed of the Sikhsar. Kazi Pakir Ahmed says he spent a couple of days with Dost Muhammad, Katkhuda of Deh Dost Muhammad, and, as usual, was hospitably treated by all. On his way back he stayed a night at the same village and found things somewhat changed. Dost Muhammad told him that orders had just reached him from Nasratabad to allow no supplies to be sold to the Mission, and similar orders, he said, had been sent to all villages. He said that he would sell us anything we wanted secretly. The Kazi reports that the Miankangi people profess great friendship to us and appear genuinely grateful to the Mission for helping them through famine times in the spring. They all say they will sell us whatever we want, whatever the orders may be. Enclosure No. 4. Telegram No. 396, dated Camp, the 19th (despatch from Dalbandin on 24th) July 1908. Prom Colonel A. H.

I have replied through Mr. Dobbs that I cannot accept this order, and that wheat and barley must also be excluded from the prohibition. Also that his order cancelling his prohibition must be circulated by sowars and foot soldiers in the same public manner as his prohibition. The inevitable consequences of such a prohibition have already begun to take effect. To-day a levy sowar bringing in 13 sacks of wheat, recently purchased for us, was set upon by the Mushrif and villagers of Kila-i-Kohna, some ten miles from here, and beaten. The wheat was seized and also the sowar’s rifle and pistol. I immediately sent Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah to the Karguzar’s brother and the Yamin-i-Nizam in the Persian camp demand ing instant redress* They promised wildly. Some of my levy sowars are to accompany the Persian sowars to-morrow to recover the seized property and the offenders. The news of the reaction in the city is rapidly spreading round the country, and we hear wonderful stories of the British Consul’s prowess and the numbers of offenders punished and the severity of their punishment. The Akhuadzada has full information from many sources, and, as I anticipated, is enjoying the situation immensely. ***** - I wrote to the Persian Commissioners to-day in acknowledgment of their letter (No. 13 of 24th, June), and pointed out how the fracas between Persians and Afghans took place over crops on the east of the line which they them selves admit in their letter to be the boundary. ***** 6th July, CamPi Kohah .—The Persians seem anxious to close the grain incident of the 2nd, and have made up the full weight of the grain seized and begged me to accept it, which I have done.

The latter received the order very suspiciously, and informed me that Mr Miller had told him that His Excellency the Viceroy had bargained with the Amir of Afghanistan that the British were to receive all land south of the Helmand from Afghanistan, and to give in exchange to Afghanistan a laree slice of Seistan land. I disabused his mind of this notion by all the arguments at my command, but I fear that he does not yet quite believe in our eood faith Another matter which makes the Hashmat-ul-Mulk suspicious of the English is that the Mustaufi of Meshed informed him that they were hack ing up his enemy* Syed Khan, Nahrui.

Translation of a letter from the Persian Commissioners to His Britannic Majesty's Special Commissioner and Arbitrator for the Persian-Afghan Boundary in Seistau, No. 18, dated the 24th June 1903. After compliments —We have had the honour of receiving your esteemed letter, dated 14ith June, on the subject of a conflict between Afghan and Seistan subjects near Deh Ali Mardan and Yar Muhammad. As desired by you, the enclosed copy of your letter under reply was sent to the local Government for information. We give below, for your information, the result of our personal enquiries and the purport of the reply which has been received from the Local Govern ment on the subject. The enquiries made by you during your tour on the Miankangi border, and the complaint made by us in clause 4 of our letter of representations, have, of course, clearly shown that, in the vicinity of the above, the division of the Helmand, which forms the boundary of Miankangi of Seistan and Chakan- sur, is called Bod-i-Tilai.* This Rod, By this is meant the contmuatmn of the Sikhsar. which ^ ^ original natural channel, and represents the boundaries of this division of the sacred territory, is clearly visible and apparent. The Afghan agent (Mamur) has caused this channel to run dry, and by digging an artificial canal has diverted the water into the newly-made channel which has given rise to such troubles. He is, perhaps, under the impression that by such illegal means he can seize and take possession of the acknowledged territory of this side. Our enquiries show that the Akhundzada, the Afghan agent, deliberately went from his camp near the Bund to Kila-i-Kang, and there he was engaged in collecting men for some days. He sent 35 Katkhudas and grey-beards with a party of his own, numbering over 300 armed men, for the purpose of suddenly. mm 1 , V ^i| GoTemi;, c Majestj's^ in Seistaoi L i ? your Local destroving the crops of the Persian subjects. After these people had caused every damage by turning the water on to their crops and cutting down millet, etc., with swords, Nur Muhammad Khan, the Katkhuda of this side, who was the owner of these crops, went with a small party, numbering not more than 10 to 12 men, in order to enquire the cause of this damage and highhandedness. No sooner had he appeared than the Afghans showered a volley of bullets on him, and ran forward to attack his small party with rifles and swords. Nur Muhammad Khan and his men, finding themselves compelled and justified in protecting and repelling their assailants, defended themselves, whereupon the Afghans fled. Now, when it is an admitted fact that the Afghans have misappropriated the said territory, and when a high officer and arbitrator and umpire represent ing a powerful Government like yourself is present here, the Afghans commit such evil and wrongful acts, it is clear what they will do on other occasions. If the Afghan agent and the Afghans knew that they had a right in this matter, and they considered cultivations of Persian subjects out of place, why did they not, before resorting to such blameable acts, inform us or the Govern ment of Seistan or yourself, and ask for redress ? P.S .—A copy of the reply which we have received from the Amir Hashmat ul-Mulk, Governor of Seistan, on this subject, is enclosed. Translation of a letter from the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Seistan, to the Karguzar, . without date. I have perused and read tbe esteemed letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner w r bich you had sent me, and have acquainted myself with its contents. Akhundzada Eakir Muhammad, w r ho is Hakim and Chief across the river on behalf of the Amir of Afghanistan, has always been, and is in the habit of, making agressive and illegal seizures of land and water on the frontier, and he never admits that he is to blame. He wishes to further his interests by iniquitous acts. The facts of the case are these:—* This land was in tbe possession of the Naibs of Persian territory who used to cultivate it every year. The Afghans never had any cultivation there, and have nothing to do with it. This year, as usual, our cultivators cultivated that land. After they had cultivated it, and when their crops were green, the Akhundzada, at the instigation of Ali Jangi, brother of Katkhuda Asghar, who is now a fugitive across the river after misappropriating Government money, sent men who ploughed np the crops and cut down the millet with swords, and damaged it. When the cultivators of this side came to know it, they tried to prevent them from doing so, which led to a quarrel between the parties. Per sian subjects bad received no information beforehand to enable them to arm themselves with rifles and swords for the occasion, but those who had come to attack them had come prepared and armed with swords and rifles. The people of this side had no thought of quarrelling. If the Akhundzada had no idea of intentionally causing a quarrel and conflict, why did he not make a represent ation to His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner, who was in the neigh bourhood, to the effect that Persian subjects had without any cause cultivated Kindly write and inform His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner of all you have seen and heard of the Akbundzada’s actions since your arrival, so that he may become acquainted with the Akhundzada’s doings, and may not give credence to the latter’s iniquitous acts. 4228 F. D.I : 6 Certain reports have reached me from the Katkhudas of those parts regarding these matters, which I forward herewith for your perusal and full information. From these you will see that Persian subjects have neither committed any wrongful act, nor attacked any one, and that, on the contrary the Afghans came and attacked them and began to commit mischief. I have troubled you with all these details for your information. Tramdation of a letter from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, to the Persian Commissioner, No. 16-P.P., dated the 2nd July 1903. After compliments.—I write to acknowledge your letter No. 13, dated 24th June. You state that the Rod-i-Tilai is the boundary between Persian and Afghan territory. Whatever the real and proper boundary may he, recent disputes, as you 'know, are due to uncertainty about the boundary, and a definite settlement is therefore necessary. The careful enquiries I have had made into the recent occurrences near Deb Ali Jangi represent the case in a somewhat different manner to the account you have giren me. The disputes in which these Afghans were wounded and one horse killed arose about some crops which are situated to the east of the Rod-i-Tilai, and are, therefore, from what you have yourselves written, in Afghan territory. A complaint, at the time of the sowing of those crops, was made to me by the Afghan Commissioner, but, as I then thought the settle ment of the boundary would be soon completed, I did not then consider it necessary to take any further action regarding the complaint. The recent order which I have been obliged to issue regarding a boundary line, will, I trust, prevent further unpleasant incidents of this nature, and enable a friendly and satisfactory settlement of the boundary question to he arrived at hereafter, when you obtain necessary authority from your Government. Enclosure No. 10. 'Extracts from tie Diary of Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 24ih July 1903. 17th July 1903, Camp Kohah —The Yamin-i-Nizam has recently moved his camp from Khwaja Ahmad to some high ground nearer our camp on the other side of the Rod-i-Seistan. The Karguzar is still in the city, and his local representative, his brother, remains in camp at Khwaja Ahmad. Hitherto, owing to their watchfulness of each other, it has been impossible to hold any separate communication with the Yamin. As this is now possible, I sent Khan Bahadur Mania Bakhsh to pay him a friendly visit to-day, and convey to him informally from himself certain remarks which were decided upon long ago, but which there has hitherto been no opportunity of conveying to him. Mania Bakhsh on his return reports that he first asked the Yamin what further instructions had been received from Tehran. He replied that he had been appointed sole Commissioner for this work, and that detailed instructions had come about the Mirjawa frontier demarcation, and these he readout. These appear to be indentical with the copy of instructions recently sent to me by Sir Arthur Hardinge with one ex ception, i.e., clause 8 runs thus :—“ It* is reported that the Afghans have recently executed some new works,f and culti vated land on the left hank of the Hel- maud to the south of the Bund-i-Seistan against General Goldsmid’s award. You are to take steps to prevent this.” Maula Bakhsh thanked him for this mark of confidence, and, in return, confided that he had long wished to get a quiet opportunity of giving the Yamin a few words of friendly warning ; that he felt sure the Yamin supplied * TheTamin stumbled over reading this, and Maula Bakhsh thinks correct wording is “ you have reported.” f I do not know what is here referred to, but I presume the opening a few years ago of the Tara- kun canal to Kila Afzal. A. H. McMahon. M7 Mr. Miller with copies of all correspondence relating to this Mission, and be knew that, if such suspicions came to the serious notice of His Britannic Majesty’s Arbitrator, he would have no alternative but to request that such a breach of international diplomatic etiquette he heavily punished. More over, that consistent efforts seemed to he made to delay the work of this Mission. The Yamin should remember that the fact that the Arbitrator’s whole aim and policy is to adhere to General Goldsmid’s award, and deal fairly with Persia and Afghanistan* must inevitably become established and proved ; and that then the Persian Government would deal hardly with any one who had tried to prove the contrary. The daily expense of this Mission is enor mous ; and if, as seemed natural, the cost will fall on the Persian Government, what will that Government do to those who have multiplied the cost by need less delay ? Maul a Bakhsh reports that this speech seemed to have “ a melancholic effect ” (m&lt;?) on the Yamin, who replied at much length. He vehemently denied giving copies of correspondence to Mr. Miller. If any one did, it must be the Karguzar. As for delays, it is all due to the Persian Govern ment for allowing no discussion of the boundary question. This is solely due to the Russians at Tehran who tell the Persians that General Goldsmid’s award is so elastic and cunningly worded that the British can interpret it any way they like, and will deprive Persia of much territory. Why do not the British give the Persian Government friendly and informal assur ances at Tehran that the line is not going to injure Persia ? The fault lies chiefly with the British, who are too formal and official. They lose every thing by not adopting the informal and unofficial attitude of the Eussians. Owing to this the worst Eussian Minister gets everything he wants, and the best British Minister gets little or nothing from the Persians. Take the worst stroke of business ever done by the British in Persia, i.e., the failure to secure the loan to Persia. I was, he said, in Tehran at the time and employed in the Pinancial Department, and know what happened. The Persians wanted to borrow from England, but England wanted to insert too many written condi tions, and obtain too many irksome guarantees which offended Persian suscep tibilities. The Eussians made no difficulties, and contented themselves with the guarantee of the Customs’ income. They have since got more concessions than the English ever asked for, but without offending Persian feelings. The Yamin then went on to say that he was genuinely anxious to assist, and not impede work. He promised that, if the British Commissioner would onlv take him into his confidence and that i would adhere to Goldsmid’s award. give him some informal assurance * that a. h. McMahon. boundary line would not injure Persia, he would at once endeavour to get further opposition abandoned at Telnan. He said that the Shah placed much confidence in him, and what he writes to Tehran carries weight. He would verify his promises by results. Would the British Commissioner allow him a private interview to talk over business matters ? 18th July, Camp After carefully considering the results of Mania Bakhsh’s interview with the Yamin of yesterday, I think the time has arrived when I can safely impart to him, or both the Persian Commissioners, the particulars of the line I intend to award. The letter and map explaining this line in detail must by now have about reached Tehran. I may as well, for the present, fall in with the Yamin’s purpose and try the effect of dealing with him separately. I accordingly received the Yamin at a private interview this evening. After some preliminary conversation, in which the Yamm led up to the question of the boundary, I said that but for the persistent refusal of the Persian Commissioners to discuss boundary matters, I would have given full information to them long ago. I now, in view of the Yamm s assurances of yesterday, am willing to do so. I explained to him the line which I intend to lay down and gave reasons for thus defining it. I was careful to state tnat it was so defined as to maintain the status quo] and that, it any a emp oe made to alter the status quo anywhere along the line, I would have to reconsider the whole line, and go back to a fuller and fuither considera ion o lv— the exact position of the main Helmand channel and edge of the Naizar at the time of General Goldsmid’s award. The Yamin fully understood my meaning. He admitted that my line was a very fair and impartial one. He promised to wire off at once to Tehran and recommend its adoption. ^ I then tackled him about the line from Bund*i-Seistan to the Koh-i-Malik Siah and, as he seemed inclined to hark back to Goldsmid’s verbal definition, I said I must adhere to the straight line of Goldsmid’s map, or consider the question of giving Afghanistan Ramrod, Hauzdar, etc. He admitted that his instructions regarding the Mirjawa border included an order to demarcate in a straight line from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Eund-i-Seistan. He promised not to raise this question again. He also accepted the straight line from Salgumi to Siah Koh. He said that, if I would give him a tracing of the map I had sent Tehran, he would write fully on the subject, and forward his recommendations on the above lines with the map to Tehran. He assured me that, in this and other matters connected with our boundary work, I would henceforth always find him amen able to reason and able to carry through his recommendations to Tehran. So far all this is satisfactory, but I doubt from previous experience of the Yamin if this Mission can safely depend on the Millenium commencing so immediately. ***** I was able throughout the interview to prevent the conversation drifting on to the Helmand water question. ***** 20th July, Camp Kohak.—I send the Yamin a tracing of the map which was sent last month to Tehran with my letter .No. 824, of 16th June. I marked on it the course of my boundary line from Nad Ali to Salgumi. 21st July, Camp Kohak.—* * * * The Yamin gave Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh a copy of the telegram he is sending to Tehran to-day. It is a lengthy production. The more important portions run thus :— “ I have become acquainted with the British Commissioner’s ideas regard ing the north-east boundary of Seistan. His ideas are exactly in accordance with my intentions and the status quo is unchanged. * * * I have obtained from the British Commissioner a map showing the points clearly, and am submitting it by post with my detailed report. * * * Kindly grant me the necessary permission and full authority by telegraph, so that boundary pillars may be built accordingly. My devotion to the Shah compels me to say that this business will he ended in a manner suitable to the dignity of the Persian Government, and I consider it expedient that it should be so ended.” Enclosure No. 11.

The Governor and Karguzar proposed various arrangements of a complicated nature which I declined to agree to. It has now, after much delay and argument, been settled that the revenue officials at Kila-i-Nao and neighbouring villages are to hand me over 3,750 maunds of wheat and 3,000 maunds of barley as^soon as possible, and take receipts for which payments will be made later on to the Governor direct. I am anxious to lay in fresh supplies of grain at an early date, as grinding wheat into flour takes much time and gives a great deal of trouble. The grinding facilities of Seistan, like everything in this neglected country, are most indifferent. There are several windmills and a few mills worked by cattle, but defective structure and small mill-stones limit the daily outturn of flour to very small amounts. Government would do well to provide the British Consulate and two or three of the chief stages on the Nushki-Seistan road with iron flour mills suitable for working by wind power or cattle. iJm I li; i * * f tie felepi: e moreii 31st July, Camp Kohak .—The Helmand has been steadily falling for a long time, and is now running at only 4,000 cubic feet a second, which is the volume of the river when we first forded it at Mashi on the 19th February. The summer floods have, as expected, caused considerable changes in the rela tive size and volume of the various arms of the river, which materially affect the Seistan water problem. The river is now getting low enough to enable these changes to be carefully examined and recorded. The time has arrived for the annual repair of the Bundi-i-Seistan, and large encampments of Seistanis are moving towards Kohak. Their work this year practically amounts to a complete reconstruction of the bund, for but little trace of the previous bund now exists. ier’i &gt;rj f S3U \K !» m Si ® 1 Enclosure No. 13.

This is due to mischief- makers on the Afghan side suggesting that the Akhundzada is not doing all he can to help on work, and so on, from which conclusions unfavourable to him are drawn. This is at the bottom of the various recent rumours regarding the Akhundzada’s recall to Kabul, etc. Musa Khan and the Akhundzada, too, have not been on good terms lately, and I think Musa Khan has been trying to frighten the Akhundzada with disquieting ideas. Musa Khan has now been nearly 1|- years away from his home in connection with Seistan boundary dis putes, and, curious to say, he is getting tired of it. He complains also of the local allowance given to him being insufficient for his expenses, and thinks the Akhundzada ought to give him something from Chakansur revenues. Un friendliness to the Akhundzada has made him make common cause with those who intrigue against him. He is already in close pommunication with Mansur Khan, Governor of Farrah, who, if I am not mistaken, will make mischief before Mission work is completed. I was sorry to see with the Akhundzada to-day one Amir Muhammad Khan, Isakzai, who has just come^ from Farrah» I reassured the Akhundzada with well worn arguments, and said things were quietly progressing towards a satisfactory conclusion. 1^ thought it advisable to allude again to Persian claims to Tarakun, etc. The time has not yet come for informing him that this question has been practically settled in Afghan favour. When an Afghan finds he has got what he wants, he always claims more.

The Yamin has •just returned from the city, where he went to say good-bye to Mr. Miller and receive his parting instructions. Maula Bakhsh found him communicative. He said he had heard privately from Tehran that his telegram of the 21st } about mv boundary line, had been received, and that his written report was awaited there.

Yesterday the work was stopped and the people dispersed. To-day Sardar Purdil Kban has arrived with orders from the Governor to have the work carried out immediately. There seems to be a difference of opinion on the subject between the Governor and the Persian Commissioners. The latter do not want the bund made while the Mission is here, as they say I may form inconvenient conclusions from the amount of water the bund sends down the Bod-i-Seistan. The Governor says, very wisely, that he and his people are not going to lose a season’s water for anything the Mamurs' may think. 22nd August Camp, Kebab. —A very large number of Seistanis are now hard at work at the Bund-i-Seistan and work is progressing rapidly. 1 i If IS Enclosure No. 15.

No reply received yet from you about Seistan boundary question, referred to in my letter 824 of 16th June, and in my telegrams ending with my No. 406 of 11th August. But yesterday Yamin-i-Nizam showed me confidentially a telegram, dated Tehran, 6th September, from Persian Foreign Minister, which is as follows:— Begins. Your reports and map have been received, and submitted to proper quarter. The Foreign Office Council consider exchange of that land with land shown in the map not advantageous to Persian Govern ment; and a clear promise should he obtained from Afghans that they will never damage present Kuhak Bund, and will not give trouble. They should also undertake not to erect any bund above Kuhak, or below Rudbar, lest water, which irrigates local land, and has been given up, should be cut off and leave this land waste. Please see carefully and report whether the land which will he given up in exchange for land taken by us will not harm Persian Government. The Council say that the land the Afghans wish to take is fertile and that the other land is waste. Please ascertain these points carefully&gt; and report quickly. Ends. Y^amin assures me his letter strongly advocated my line, and attributes present indecision to Russian interference. He says he will telegraph to dayas follows '.—Begins. I have received your telegram and will carry out your instructions. I have made careful enquiries again, and can say that proposed exchange will be advantageous to Persian Government. It is necessary that the boundary should be settled first and demarcated; also the lesser question can then be taken up. I would suggest Your Excellency’s having an inter view with British Minister, with a view to discussing the matter. Ends. Yamin desires that fact of his showing me above telegrams should not become known to Persian Government. Exchange of land referred to is fully exxfiained in paragraphs 8 and 9 of my letter 821 of 16th June. I cannot discuss water questions until boundary is settled. Unless Persian Government agree to the reasonable compromise proposed, and to demarcation of line defined in my letter, and of the straight lines north and south thereof, they must face risk of the arbitral award following strict definition of Goldsmid’s award and map, and ignoring present conditions of Persian occupation through past encroach ments. I advocate early decision about boundary line, as Afghans are getting impatient. Question now raised about Afghan bunds above Seistan lies outside my arbitral jurisdiction, and I have strictly avoided any reference whatever to it in discussions with Persians. I trust that you may be able to prevent it being raised again, but, if this is impossible, the opinion of Govern ment of India should be obtained as to how question should be treated.

I have sent the following telegram to Colonel McMahon, 18th September, No. 126Your telegram, dated the 12th September, received to-day. The Persian Minister for Eoreign Affairs told me some time ago that his Government had practically accepted Yamin-i-Nizam’s suggestion, but that they wpre tele graphing to ask him to explain certain particulars which were not quite clear to them? The e^-Grand Vizier informed me, on the 16th instant, that he had, before leaving office, finished the Seistan affair, and I understood from him that your and the Yamin’s line had been accepted. I pointed out that Govern ment* of Persia had gained by your rectification, to which he expressed assent. No doubt the Eussians have obtained information regarding the arrange ment, and they have endeavoured to pick holes in it, but I expect that by the time this reaches you, the Yamin will have received instructions from the Persian Government accepting the arrangement Persian telegrams are, how ever, a long time in transit between here and Seistan. You may let the Yamin see this telegram. Sent to Eoreign, Simla. Enclosure No. 17. Extract from tie Diary of Colonel A. E. McMahon, C.S.7., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 31st August 190o. 26th August, Camp Kohak.-I sailed up the Eod-i-Seistan to look at the progress of work on the Bund-i-Seistan. The Seistanis assembled there had never seen a sailing boat before, and the sight of a boat sailing up against a strongish current surprised them. The bund is a very heavy piece of work. It is made entirely of branches of tamarisk. The w'ood of this tree is too heavy to float, and so it is admirably adapted for work of this kind. Ihe boughs are tied into faggots and laid one on top of the other, so that the branches more or less interlace. The bund is made about 100 feet wide and about 10 feet high, except where the deep channel necessitates greater height. ie en D &gt; finished, will be about 300 yards or so. The amount of tamarisk a work of this kind requires is enormous. Nature fortunately has supplied an a mos mited quantity along the river banks. The Persians are hesita mgw emake the bund stronger or weaker than usual this year. Opinions are divided as to which method will deceive me the more satisfactorily. 29th August, Camp Kohak.—'lhQ old Akhundzada came and paid me a long visit. He is watching the building of the Bund-i-Seistan with much interest. Whatever departure the Persians make Horn recognised custom, he says he will adopt in his bunds elsewhere, in retaliation. In past years Afghans and Persians have always jogged along amicably in this matter. The Akhundzada has allowed the Persians to cut tamarisk on the Afghan bank and has even assisted the construction. It has always been the recognised custom to build the bund as loosely as requirements of strength allowed, so that water could percolate through it, and thus allow about 50 per cent, of the volume of the Helmand to continue onwards in the main channel. Moreover, above the winter water level on the bund, wide gaps in the upper surface of the bund were left to facilitate the flow of flood water beyond the bund. Last year, owing to mischievous advice, the Seistanis not only built the bund very compact, but strengthened it with earth, thus allowing little or no water to pass through it, and it was owing to this that the Akhundzada in retaliation built a bund higher up the Helmand to turn the river into his canal on the other bank. Enclosure No. 18. Extract from the Diary of Colonel A, H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 16th September 1903. 11th September, Camp KohaTc .—The Yamin-i-Nizam, who has returned from the city, asked if he might come and see me, and said he would like to first have an interview with Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, as he has got news from Tehran. Maula Bakhsh went to see him and was shown a telegram, dated Tehran, 6th, which the Yamin has just received from the Persian Foreign Minister. It acknowledges his reports, and says that the Foreign Office Council consider that the exchange of land involved by the proposed boundary line is more advantageous to Afghanistan than Persia. The Yamin is to again examine the lands and report. He is to obtain a promise from the Afghans not to damage the Kohak Bund, and not to construct bunds between Rodbar and the Bund-i-Kohak. The first portion of the telegram shows that the Persian Government have misunderstood the question of boundary line. The Yamin assures me his letter put the case very clearly, and that the present indecision of the Persian Foreign Office must be due to misrepresentation by Russians at Tehran. The reference to the Helmand above Seistan indicates a probability of further complications, and I expect the Yamin’s surmise is correct. My report on the subject, dated 16th June, must have reached Tehran about the middle of July, and the Yamin’s report about the 18th August. It is disappointing to think that by the 6th September matters had not pro gressed, but retrogressed. The Yamin says he will telegraph in reply, saying that he has again examined the lands, and can assure the Persian Government that the exchange is an advantageous one; that it is necessary to settle and demarcate the boundary line first, and then water questions can be considered. I told the Yamin that I absolutely declined to discuss water questions until the boundary line was settled. I managed, as I have always done so far, to avoid any reference whatever being made to the Helmand above Seistan. I tele graphed to Tehran and the Government of India reporting above. The Yamin is hopeful that his reply may put matters straight. I am not sanguine about this. * * * * ^ ^ 15th September, Camp Kohak .—The Seistanis have completed the Bund-i- Seistan, It is an imposing structure of tightly packed tamarisk branches*rilitl the whole width of the Helmand, 300 yards long, 66 feet wide on an average, and of height varying from 7J- to 15 feet. The Afghans complained that the usual openings at the top have not been left to facilitate passage of water when the river rises a little higher. I am interested to see that, notwithstanding this the Akhunzada allowed the Persians to freely cut and remove tamarisk trees, from the Afghan side of the river, for the bund. Only about 50 % Helmand now finds its way through the bund. The Eod*i-Seistan in consequence is now very high and only fordable at a few places.

On .the other hand, we hear that the Afghans are energetically enlarging Khushk canal (tins is smal canal on right bank about five miles above Kuhak bund) Why has tins not been stormed ? In previous telegram we reminded yon that principal condition is a definite promise from Afghans that existing bund of Kuhak shall remain unal- terablv erected, and that no bund will ever be built between the Kuhak bund and Rudbar bund, lest water that should go to Kuntdar and Tarakun lands be cut off, and those lands made useless. [This must refer to portion of Tarakun tract west of boundary line. I believe Persians have some vague idea of asking Afghans to construct a joint canal through Tarakun.] The reason of tins is that Persian Government intend to reclaim those lands, and repopulate them for the protection of trade. You say that proposed exchange of lands (evidently Siksar lands are referred to here) is not harmful to Persian Government, but perusal of your map shows differently. Please carefully estimate value of lands given up and those to be received by us, and report quickly as matter is urgent. Ends. Yamin seemed to be genuinely disappointed, and again attributed mis understanding at Tehran to Kussian representations. I informed him I adhere to the determination not to take up water questions, until the boundary line is demarcated, and conveyed a hint that, unless my reasonable compromise regarding the line is accepted, I can no longer repress Afghan representations, and must reconsider whole line de novo, and follow strictly definition of Gold- smidt’s award. I trust you will be able to obtain unconditional consent to^ demarcation of my line. Matter is urgent, as introduction of new questions will render satis factory completion of arbitration work most doubtful. I hope you will be able to send me copies of any instructions given to Persian Commissioners. Yamin is most anxious that fact of his showing me these telegrams will not be divulged. He is much perturbed for personal reasons at changes in Persian Ministry. Addressed to Sir A. Hardinge. Enclosure No. 23. Telegram, dated Daibandin, the 14th October E 03. From— Colonel A. H.

Owing to its greater importance, the straight line to Koh-i-Malik Siah will, notwithstanding all difficulties, be very carefully marked by pillars. After demarcation I will thoroughly tackle the water questions, and I think that the Persian Government would be well advised not to attempt, at this stage, to impose restrictions ; for instance, their suggestion stated in your telegram of 9th October would, if carried out, deprive the Persians of its principal bund, namely, the Kuhak Bund.

Demarcation wil take long time, during which water questions can he fully discussed. Failing an unconditional acceptance, it is important to obtain in, writing sufficient to establish the fact of Persia having practically admitted that scope ot arbitration includes the boundary question. This will, if worst comes to the worst, enable me to deliver final award on the boundary line regardless ol Persian objections, which would have then to he fought out on appeal. My main object has been, and still is, to obviate any necessity for appeal by either party, and thus to enable demarcation to be carried out immediately after the award has been delivered.

My telegram No. 460, 22nd October. Tamin came to-day to make further representations in compliance with recent telegram from Mushir-ed- Dowleh—see my telegrams 454 and 455 of 17th and 18th October. I spoke to him very plainly, and pointed out the discrepancy between hig representations and assurances given to you by Mushir-ed-Gowleh in regard to the acceptance of my boundary line. I absolutely declined to allow my proposed compromise in regard to the boundary line to be coupled with any condition whatever. I declined to discuss the water questions until boundary line is disposed of. After that all water questions will be fully discussed I pointed out the length to which I had gone in trying to determine a mutually satisfactory boundary line. As that has not been accepted, I saw no alternative but to reconsider the whole question on strictly judicial lines and give an award based on the documentary interpretations of Goldsmids boundary line as furnished by the Persian Government themselves. I showed him portions of Mr. Thomson’s despatch No. 74 of 15th October 1872 to Lord Granville of Lord Granville’s letter of 3rd July 1873 to the Sadr Azam, of the Persian Ambassador’s memorandum of 24th June 1874 to Lord Derby, and of Sir Ronald Thomson’s despatch of 30th July 1884 to the Government of India, which clearly proved that the Persian Government had admitted Ramrod district and iakht-i-Shah were on the Afghan side of the Goldsmid boundary line. Yamin admitted the force of my argument and promised to urge Persian Government to accept my boundary line forthwith. He endeavoured hard to extract some promise from me regarding the bunds on the Helmand above Kuhak, but I declined to give any promise whatever except that of fully discussing water question hereafter on the lines of Goldsmid’s award.

Extract from the Diary of Colonel A. E. McMahon, C.S.L, C.I.E., British Commissioner, Ssistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 8th October 1903. 7th October, Camp Euhcih.-— T Y\\Q Yamin-i-Nizam asked for an interview to-day, and showed me a telegram, dated 2nd October, from the Mushir-ed- Dowleh, which acknowledged his telegrams and reports and said he had heard from the British Minister that the British Commissioner and Yaminhad agreed regarding the boundary line. On the other hand, the Persian Government had learnt that the Afghans were energetically enlarging the Khushk Canal. Why had this not been stopped? The Yamin was reminded that the Mushir-ed- Dowleh’s former telegram demanded, as the principal condition of accepting the boundary line, a definite promise from the Afghans that the Bund-i-Kuhak would be left unaltered, and that no bund would ever be constructed between that bund and the Kodbar Bund, lest water that should go to the Knntdar and Tarakun lands be cut off and those lands be made useless. The Mushir-ed- Dowleh said that the reason for this was that the Persian Government intend to reclaim those lands which were once cultivated and populated, and to reculti vate and repopulate them for the protection of trade. While the Yamin con tends that the exchange of lands (evidently the small compromise near Sikhsar is meant here) is not harmful to Persia, the map shows differently. The Yamin is ordered to carefully estimate the comparative value and productiveness of all lands concerned and report again quickly. This telegram is practically a repetition of the Persian Government telegram of 6th September and is most disappointing, as a telegram, dated 18th September, from the British Minister, Tehran, had led me to understand that my boundary line had been accepted. The Yamin was evidently genuinely disappointed, and he again attributes the present situation to Russian misrepresentation at Tehran. As a matter of fact, I know Doctor Miller is constantly sending men to watch what the Afghans are doing in the matter of canals, and some short while ago we nearly caught one at the Khushk Canal. He doubtless keeps Tehran well supplied with alarming reports and rumours. The Khushk Canal, hitherto known by many names, but now definitely entitled the Sultani Canal, is about five miles above the Bund-i- Seistan, and is the one wTiich the Afghans made last year. It is really a re opening of a very ancient canal. The Afghans, moreover, are not enlarging it, but only clearing it of last year’s silt. W’hen water was admitted into it the other day, it only drew 14 cusecs. The reference to Tarakun lands is somewhat vague, but I gather from the Yamin that the Persians propose to ask the Afghans to let them construct* a joint canal through Tarakun, to irrigate the portion of that tract which lies west of the Per sian boundary. The Yamin asked my advice about replying to this telegram. I said I adhered to my former statement, and declined absolutely to embark upon any discussion whatever about water questions till the boundary line is disposed of. I was disappointed at the way in which a very fair, impartial, and reason able compromise had been treated, and unless it is accepted, I would have no alternative but to return to a wider consideration of the boundary^ question. I could no longer repress the claims raised by the Afghans, and which were only held back in hopes of a mutually favourable compromise. This meant a very wide view of the question, and would probably result in an award based on the strict interpretation of the Goldsmid award. I pointed out how very un favourably to Persia that award could be interpreted. The Yamin assured me he would do his best, and advised our both telegraphing to Tehran in similar terms, so that the British Minister and Persian Foreign Minister might not talk at cross purposes. This was agreed upon. The Yamin was very anxious that the fact of his showing me his telegrams should not be divulged to the Persian Government. He seems perturbed about rumoured changes in the Persian Ministry. The downfall of the Atabeg and Mushir-ed-Dowleh, especially the latter, are detrimental to his own personal *Two details seem to have been overlooked, i.e., that the Afghans would never agree to this, and, secondly, that the Persians and Afghans com bined could not construct a canal to effect the desired object.

He seems to find some consolation in tlie thought that the Amin- ed-Dowleh and Nasr-ul-Mulk, the one through ant of energy and the other through inexperience, mil not remain long in office. 8th October, Camp Kuhah.—l sent Khan Bahadur Mania Bakhsh to see the Yamin and find out what he has telegraphed. He reports that the telegram stated that he had had an interview with the British Commissioner, who expessed inability to take up water questions until the boundary is settled. Adds that the boundary settlement will not prejudice water ques tions, and that it is to the interest of the Persian Government to settle the former as quickly as possible. He said he had nothing to add to former reports, which contained fullest information on all matters, and, as regards the lands referred to, the value of those falling to Persia was as much as, or more than, that of those falling to Afghanistan.

McMahon, C.S.T., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, Seistan, I* 0 ^he Foreign Secretary, Viceroy’s Camp ; repeated to Foreign, Simla. My telegram No. 472 of the 4th November. The boundary line would now appear settled as far as Persians are concerned, and it now remains to settle up with the Afghans. Owing to recent firman received from Amirj which again lays stress upon His Excellency the Viceroy’s letter No. 51-E* y* of 24th November 1902, I foresee that Afghan Commissioner will be afraid t°consent to actual demarcation of any line which does not include Takht-i-Shah in Afghanistan without Amir’s permission. I urge advisability of your writing early to Amir, informing him that I have acquainted you with the particulars of the line which I am now about to award ; that you consider it the most fair and impartial settlement of case that the interpretation of Goldsmid award admits of. It fortunately follows the line of actual present occupation by both sides, and will thus obviate rupture of friendly relations between people of Persian and Afghan Seistan. I would suggest you add that you regret to find that owing to inaccuracy of Goldsmid map, now proved by careful survey, Takht-i-Shah lies on the Persian side of Goldsmid line, but that it is of little importance, as it is a small tract of very poor ground which, moreover, cannot be irrigated from the Afghan side. It has been occupied by the Persians for many years. Your only reasons for regret in this matter are the fact of having inadvertently led Amir to misunderstand position of that place in letter above quoted, and fact that I report that Akhundzada has in consequence made great efforts to get this place included in Afghanistan. The Amir should be asked to authorise Afghan Commissioner, without delay, to assist in early demarcation of line by boundary pillars to obviate further disputes. As soon as boundary is marked out, I will give award on the existing water disputes between Persians and Afghans in Seistan. I will now at once supply full written particulars of the line and necessary map to Akhundzada for the information of the Amir. Post to Kabul from here takes about nine days.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—His Highness the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.M.G. After compliments .—I have now heard from Colonel McMahon that he has delivered his award upon the frontier of Chakansur and Persian Seistan from the Koh-i-Malik Siah, in the south, to the Siah Koh, in the north. Fortunately he has been able to settle a boundary which is m accordance with present possession and does not disturb existing cultivation, and which is, I understand, accepted as fair both by the Afghan and the Persian officers .employed m the case A copy of the decision has been furnished to the Hakim of Chakansur, who has doubtless already submitted it to Your Highness for ratification. I have only to point out that the award allows the Persons to construct a bund of the present type in or about the present site near Kohak, but does not deal with the irrigation questions which Colonel McMahon will now proceed to settle * • The claim of the Persians to the whole of the Tarakun tract has been rejected, and the boundary from Koh-i-Malik Siah to the Bund-i-Kohak has been fixed by a straight line as shown in Colonel Goldsmid s map, and this line, with the rest of the boundary settled, will he demarcated by pillars to prevent such disputes in the future.

I! 11follows practically the old bed of the Helmana or Siksar, but runs a little to the west of this in one place, to include villages now in Afghan possession. These substantial advantages to the interests of Your Highness are qualified only by a slight concession -which Colonel McMahon has felt called upon to make in the direction of Takht-i-Shah, where a careful examination of the spot, which has now been made for the first time, shows that the conclusions arrived at in 1872, when the locality was not visited by the Commissioners, were erroneous. The Akhundzada has faithfully and ably presented the argu ments on the Afghan side of the case; but his final acceptance of Colonel McMahon’s decision shows that he is satisfied of its justice, as I also have been. The reasons which have led me to this conclusion are : (1) That whether Takht-i-Shah was in 1872 inside or outside the Naizar—and it would appear to have been undoubtedly outside 0 f ft—it is now a small and narrow spit of land projecting into the Naizar, but not belonging to it. (2) That it has been occupied for many years by the Persians without any protest from the Afghans. (3) That the Afghans have similarly encroached upon other villages outside the Naizar, not strictly belonging to them according to the Goldsmid award, and that it would be unwise to give fresh cause for rupture of friendly settlement by disturbing these long standing occupations on both sides. Prom a careful study of the map and of the reasoning on both sides, I am convinced that a fair and impartial interpretation has now been given to the Goldsmid award in these parts which will provide an easily recognised boundary (defined by tappas or mounds) for the future. I hope that Your Highness will agree with my views, and that you will issue early orders to your local officers to co-operate with Colonel McMahon and the Persians in erecting the necessary pillars. It is rarely that a disputed boundary can be fixed that will give equal satisfaction to both parties. But in the present case I am of opinion not only that this has been done, but that Your Highness’s interests are more safely protected by the new boundary than by the old one, while your right to certain important tracts which were dis puted by the Persians at the commencement of the proceedings has been satis factorily and conclusively established.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 24th October 1903. 17th October 1903, Camp Kohak .—The Yamin-i-Nizam came to see me this afternoon and showed me the following telegram, dated Tehran, the 12th October, from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh: “ I am commanded by His Majesty the Shah to say that if the Amir of Afghanistan gives a promise never to construct any other bund south of Kohak, viz., at any place where the Helmand runs only in Afghan territory, we shall agree to the demarca tion of the boundary which you ha-ve considered advisable with the Commis sioner. In your last telegram you have said it might be possible to get this condition accepted. Please represent this matter and communicate result quicklyThe Mushir-ed-Dowlek’s telegram hardly agrees with the assurances given by him to Sir A. Hardinge as stated in his telegram of the 10th October (diary entry of 14th October). I asked the Yamin what was meant by the Helmand in Afghan territory. Did this mean the Helmand up to its source ? He said no, only the river up to Rudbar, i.e., in what used to be Seistan. I asked if he thought the Afghan Commissioner would consent to bind the Amir by any such promise without reference to Kabul. He agreed with me that this was doubtful, but the Persian Government would be willing to take my promise instead. I pointed out that, as Arbitrator, I was not called upon to promise anything. I again said I declined to mix up the boundary question with water questions. This telegram, however, I said, required further consideration, as it showed that the Persian Government were anxious to clutch at anything that delayed tire boundary settlement, I would give a more detailed reply in a day or two. The Yamin asked permission to go to the city for a few days to visit the prince, and it was agreed that 1 would give him a further reply when he returned. ****** 22nd October 1903, Camp Kohak .—Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, whom I had sent for a few days to the city to assist Captain Ramsay in Consulate matters, returned to-day and brought copies of further telegrams which the Yamin had just received from Tehran. One is from the Shah himself, dated the 14th October, asking him to carefully consider a telegram which the Mushir-ed- Dowleh was sending him and telegraph his opinion. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s telegram reproduced a report which it stated had been made to the Shah. This report stated that the Afghans are making a new canal to irrigate lands between Kila-i-Fath and Chakansur under English supervision, and that the chief object of the British Mission is to bring under cultivation all waste lands on the Afghan side. It is also contemplated to make a new bund to irrigate lands at Tarakun and Hauzdar, and thus interfere with the “ Kokhak ” bund. The Persian Commissioners seem to be unaware of this and of the fact that the Goldsmid award left the cultivation only on the left bank of the Helmand in Afghan territory. The report urges the Shah to obtain a promise from the English and Afghans that lands hitherto lying waste in Afghan territory should not be brought under cultivation. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh calls upon the Yamin for an explanation and full information, and he is warned that if anything happens that may be injurious to Persian interests, he will be held responsible for it and “ a blot will remain against his name in history ”. The origin of this report to the Shah is obvious. It is identical with the exposition of the objects of this Mission made to the Governor of Seistan and the Persian Commissioners by Mr. Miller, before the Mission even left India. The spelling of Kohak, i.e., Kokhak, is Russian. In all other Persian telegrams and letters the proper Persian spelling, Kuhak, is used. ******* 24th October 1903, Camp Kohak—The Yamin was to have visited me yesterday, but arrived too late in the day from the city. He came this morning, and I had a very important interview with him. I pointed out how materially the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s telegrams to him differed from the assurances given from time to time to Sir Arthur Hardinge. I again expressed my inability to discuss water questions before the boundary line is disposed of. When that is done, all water questions will be fully taken up, and discussed on the lines of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s award. As for the boundary line, I pointed out the length to which I had gor© to determine a line which would be fair and acceptable to both sides, and suit t existing conditions. As this was not received in the proper spirit, I saw no alternative but to reconsider the question on wider and more judicial lines. I would have, therefore, to be largely guided by documentary records of the1 U\ Despatch from British Minister, Tehran, to Lord Granville, No 71 of 15th October 1872. (») Letter from Lord Granville to the Sadr Azam of 3rd J uly 1873. . . . , (Hi) Memorandum from Persian Ambassador, London, to Lord Derby, of 24th June 1874. liv) Despatch from British Minister, Tehran, to the Government of India, dated 30th July 1884. interpretation of the Goldsmid line made by the Persian Government them- ^ selves. I read and translated to him and, in the case of those written in French, allowed him himself to read passages in the letters marginally noted, which prove clearly that the Persian Government ad mitted that the Goldsmid line left not only Tarakun but the Ramrud district on the south-west and the Naizar and Takht-i-Shah on the north on the Afghan side. The Yamin fully admitted the force of my arguments, but made an eloquent appeal to me to give him some assurance that the Afghans would not be allowed to construct any bund above Kohak. All objections to my boundary line would then be withdrawn. I said that the matter had reached a stage in which 1 considered the attempt to couple my very fair and impartial proposal regarding the boundary with conditional promises as deroga- tory to mv position as Arbitrator, and I absolutely declined to give any promises or make any assurances whatever, except that I would tackle water questions on the lines of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s award in as impartial a spirit as I had en deavoured to tackle the boundary question. The Yamin said he had taken w'hat I had said, at our former interview, as indicating an intention to give him a more favourable reply, and, on the strength of this, he had held out hopes of a favourable reply, in a telegram to the Mushir-ed-Dowlek of 20th October. I expressed regret at his having understood this, as I never intended to give him any such impression. The best thing he could do now was to represent me to his Government as being in a most vicious humour, and advise them to close with my boundary proposal as quickly as possible. He promised to do his best. Our interview was of a very friendly nature throughout, hut I thought the time had come for calling a spade a spade and not a Persian “ teshd.” To relieve any apprehension that may be lurking in the Seistani mind of our early departure from Seistan, I have obtained, through the British Consul, written orders from the Governor for the delivery to us of 3,750 maunds more of revenue wheat and 3,000 maunds more of barley. This in addition to the • While Mission resides in Seistan and camelmen can UmOUnt already Collected and Stored, m buv their own grain from the people.

It is also partly in the interests of the wretched Seistanis themselves, because, in order to take advantage of possible further Mission requirements and raise the rate of grain sold to us, the unfortunate people have not even yet been allowed to remove their own share of grain from the threshing floors, although it is live months since the harvest was cut. By direct purchase from the Governor at this stage, I put it out of his power to raise the rates on us, as he might, and would, do at sales later on. I can always dispose of surplus grain when the time comes. Enclosure No. 49. Extracts from the Diary of Colonel A. M.

I thought it advisable to remind the Akhundzada again of the claims made by Persia to Tarakun and all country on the right bank of the Helmand except actual present cultivation. He is beginning to take a more gloomy view on this point, which I trust for his own sake he will communicate to Kabul. 9 * * * « « ?;• 29th October 1903—1 received a telegram from Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated 20th October, saying that the Persian Government had accepted my boundary line on the sole condition that the Afghans engage never to destroy the Kohak bund. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh had telegraphed to the Yamin to accept my line on this condition, adding that “ the bund should never be altered from its present state”. What this may mean I fail to understand, but I expect it is only another way of saying that no bunds diminishing the amount of water which at present reaches the Kohak bund should be made above that place. I must await an explanation on this point from the Yamin. As for the bund itself, although made so substantially a short while ago, it already shows signs of wear and, owing to its bed being cut away from under it its top is already, in places, below the surface of the water. ’ * * * * » * * Enclosure No. 50. Extract from the Diary of Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 8th November 1903. Camp Kohak. c 4th November 1903 .—The Yamin came to see me. I asked him what the meanin 0 * of the condition not to alter the Kohak Band was. He said it meant little or nothing. What had happened, he said, was that His Majesty the Shah bavin* been persuaded by mischief-makers to interfere personally in this Seistan° business, his Ministers were trying, while conceding to our request, to save the Shah’s face. I said I adhered to my determination not to attach any condition whatever to my boundary settlement. He said this was unnecessary, that it would suffice if I told him I would include in my award on the water question a clause to the effect that the Kohak Bund should not he destroyed or altered. I said I would have no objection to this as, in any case I would have inserted a clause of this kind. I warned him clearly not to think or lead his Government to think, that this was equivalent to any promise or assurance on my part regarding my future treatment of the water question. I informed the British Minister of this arrangement by telegram and asked him unless any action taken by him on my telegrams of 24th and 26th October had altered the situation, to inform the Persian Government, and get early order* sent to the Persian Commissioners to commence demarcation. I sent Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah this morning to pay a casual visit to the Akhundzada and to take the opportunity, if the Akhundzada alluded, as I felt sure he would, to boundary matters, to speak somewhat gloomily on the subject. I directed him especially to find out, if possible the purport of whatever correspondence had passed between the Amir and the Akhundzada on tiiis subject He had a very important and useful interview of over five hours with the Akhundzada and Musa Khan. They, of course, turned the conversion at the start off to Af^ 0 ^ 0 ^°^ thoroughly threshed out once more. All th . e , ld T uYhundzada seemed to paraded and my °J n ^The aSbi^toty^oTsir Pred.

The Akhundzada repeated to Mir Shams Shah the contents of his letters to the Amir, and the Amir’s replies. I am glad to hear that he did what I hoped he would, i.e., take a very gloomy view of the prospects of our boundary settlement in his letters to the Amir. So much so that, m a letter, the Amir told the Akhundzada not to be so despondent; that if he failed to get a satisfactory boundary, he, the Amir, would himself tackle Colonel McMahon! The discussion showed clearly that, if only the Afghans could get the straio-ht line of boundary to Koh-i-Malik Siah, and save Tarakun, the Akhund zada and Musa Khan would willingly accept the northern boundary which I -had previously expounded to them. Personally they uould accept at once, but owing to the mention made of Takht-i-Shah in the Amir’s letters, they ■were afraid to start demarcating any line without the sanction of the Amir that did not include Takht-i-Shah in Afghanistan. All this is so far very satisfactory. The Afghans have let off so much steam to-day that I ought to have an easier task with them to-morrow. On Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah’s return, I sent word to the Akhundzada asking him to come and see me to-morrow. 5th November The Akhundzada and Musa Khan came to see me. I said I had heard the whole of their discussion of yesterday. No new argu ments had been raised. Had they anything new to say to-day ? As they could not think of anything that had not been said before, I went on to inform them that the result of my struggles with the Persian Government had suddenly at last resulted in a satisfactory ending, that the straight line from Kohak to Koh-i-Malik Siah had been settled upon, and I was now ready to give my award. This I forthwith propounded. I could see that both the Akhundzada and Musa Khan were genuinely satisfied with it. They dwelt, however, on their anxiety about how the Amir might take the fact of Takht-i-Shah being left in Persia. I said I would do all I could to relieve them of any responsibility in this matter by referring, in the letter forwarding my award, to the persistent efforts they had made to obtain that singularly useless place. They thanked me warmly and took a most cordial farewell. 6th November 1903 .—I received a telegram, dated 1st November, from the British Minister, Tehran, saying that orders have been sent to the Yamin to accept my boundary line unconditionally. The Akhundzada sent me a present of several camel-loads of melons and a ravine deer. My award, I am glad to see, is taken well. He also forwarded a complaint, received from his headmen near Sikhsar, that the Persians have again irrigated the tract of land near Ganguzar on the east of the Sikhsar. The Persians in question are reported to have stated that they have done this by the Governor’s orders, and are authorised to summon assistance if interfered with. It was owing to disputes over this land that I was obliged to issue my provisional boundary order of 14th June. This action on the part of the Persians is most timely, as, only yesterday, the Akhundzada seemed inclined to think that this tract was no longer disputed. We have much to thank the Persians for. They have a wonderful faculty for doing the wrong thing at the right time. I have asked the Yamin to put a stop to this, and have sent on the complaint to the Governor, through the British Consul, for necessary orders. 7th November 1903 .—No news of importance. 8th November 1903 .—The last two days have been fully occupied in preparing a map to illustrate my award. It is a map of 4 miles=l inch, in tw r o sheets, showing the boundary in detail from Siah Koh to Malik Siah Koh. The names are all in Persian, and the rivers, Hamun, and the Naizar are coloured so as to facilitate the understanding of it. I sent it this afternoon to the Akhundzada with a long letter stating my award and the reasons for laying down the line as awmrded. The letter refers to the strenuous effortsmade by the Akbundzada and Musa Khan to obtain Takht-i-Shah, and so on. Needless to say, the letter, though addressed to the Afghan Commissioner, is written entirely with the object of explaining the whole case to the Amir. I deputed Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah to take the letter and map, and explain both fully to the Afghans. I asked him to make sure that the Afghans had left nothing unsaid to me ; to explain to them again very clearly that this was my last, and final, say in the matter, and that any objection, here after, must take the form of an appeal to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He was especially to warn the Afghans that the Persians had been, with difficulty, made to agree to this line, and that if the Afghans, by creating delays or raising objections, gave the Persians the opportunity of re-raising the question in the form of appeal, which, at present, is out of their power, it would bo the Afghans who would be most likely to suffer thereby. I pointed out how strenuously the Bussians had endeavoured to prevent any settlement being arrived at Tehran and how delays might give further oppor tunities of mischievous interference. Mir Shams Shah carried out these in structions. The Akhundzada and Musa Khan said they had not another word to say in the matter and they realised the necessity for avoiding delays; so much so, that notice had been sent up the dak line towards Kandahar to prepare for an urgent express to Kabul. They would, after retaining a copy of my letter send off the original of my letter and map that very night to Kabul, with a strong recommendation that early orders for demarcation of the line be sent by the Amir. When pressed by Mir Shams Shah to honestly express their own real feelin 0, on the subject, both the Akhundzada and Musa Khan admitted candidlv that the line was an absolutely fair and just one, and they could not, either of them, suggest any alteration that would not be unreasonably hard oa the Persians. I was very gratified to get this admission, as it fully com pensates for many months of worry. Both sides are satisfied and my work as arbitrator in the Seistan boundary question is finished. It seems difficult Jo see how, under these circumstances, there is much scope for creating delay in commencing demarcation work, but in boundary matters all things are possible. Arbitration in the water question still remains, but I will defer {he con sideration of this till demarcation work is over. ***** Enclosure No. 51. Extract from, the Diary of Colonel A. H.

Katkhuda Nur Muhammad, who led the Persians, was ported to have stated that he was acting under the nnthoritv to summon assistance if interfered with. I thought the incident very extraordinary 1 one, for I know that the Hashmat-ul-Mu k had sent stringent orders to^his people not to transgress the boundary line I ^ 111 mv urovisional order of Uth June and, m the present state ot our mutual “fationl, U was very unlikely the Governor would countenance disobedience of ^ “f^ordin-lv despatched a very trustworthy and intelligent member of this M^ion Jelal Khan, an Atckakzai Khan of Quetta, whom I have alwaysfound both reliable and unimaginative, to Mian Kangi, obstensibly to purchase ghi and dal, but with instructions to quietly enquire the actual facts of the recent incident. Jelal Khan has contracted a useful marriage alliance with the family of Katkhuda Dost Muhammad of Deh Dost Muhammad, the elder brother of Nur Muhammad. He returned to-day, and reports that Dost Muham mad was very annoyed with his brother Nur Mumammad for what he had done, but was then ignorant of why he had done it. Jelal Khan went on to stay with Nur Muhammad, who gave him the following statementA short while ago the senior Customs officer (Mons. Maurice), while touring in Mian ' Kangi, twice visited me and asked why I was not cultivating the Ganguzar lands which I cultivated last year. I replied that I had cultivated them last year by the Governor’s orders, but that the British Commissioner had issued an order for us not to go there again, and the Governor has strictly warned us not to disregard that order. The Customs officer said that didn’t matter, and it was foolish not to cultivate those lands. No harm would come to me if I did, as Mir Haji, who is half owner with me in our Mian Kangi lands, is brother of Sultan Mir Husain, the Governor’s headman, and the blame, if any, would fall on him. I replied that I was afraid to disobey orders. The Customs officer .then said he would speak to the Governor about the matter and wmuld get permission to cultivate sent to me through Muhammad Baza Khan, the Customs Mirza at Deh Dost Muhammad. A few days later Muhammad Raza Khan came to me and said that orders had come from the £ Hukumat ’ (equi valent in this sense to ‘Head-quarters’) for me to cultivate the Ganguzar lands. Thinking this was true, I collected my men and turned water on to those lands and irrigated double the area we tried to cultivate last season ”. I am convinced in my own mind that the Governor never sent the above orders, and that this is only another of the familiar type of cases in which the Belgians use their official position in the country to endeavour to annoy us, disturb the country, and discredit the Governor. I have asked Captain Ramsay to tackle the Governor and obtain an explanation of his conduct in this matter. This will necessitate the Governor sending for Nur Muhammad and extracting his statement. In this way we may obtain some further proof of Mons. Maurice’s action. Whether we do or not, I consider there is sufficient reason already for believing Nur Muhammad’s statement. Messrs. M aurice and D’Hoedt have both been making repeated tours in Mian Kangi lately, which the trifling importance of Customs work in that country would hardly account for. Their real object is doubtless to assist the Russian Consul here in obtaining material wherewith to frighten the Persian Government at iehran about our boundary settlement. They are now a trifle late in the day to do much good in that line. It seems a pity that the practical control of our trade in this country should be left in the hands of Belgian officers, who, themselves and their predecessors, have never neglected a single opportunity of endeavouring to injure our interests and influence. I have read of “the impartial Belgian Customs officer” and often wonder why one has never been sent to Seistan. 12th November, Camp Kohak .—No news of importance. 13th November, Camp Kohak .—No news of importance. 14th November, Camp Kohak .—The Yamin yesterday reported the receipt of a telegram from Tehran, and I sent Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh to see him to-day. The Yamin showed him the telegram, which was to the following effect: “ By order of His Majesty you are authorised to accept the settlement of the boundary agreed upon between you and the Chief of the British Com mission of which you sent a map some time ago, and to sign the protocol. But try to make a satisfactory arrangement about the Helmand water, and see that we do not make any mistake about it that may cause repentance to the Persian Government and give you an everlasting bad name ”. This telegram corre sponds with the one of which the despatch was reported in the British Tehran Legation telegram of 1st November. Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, therefore, in accordance with my instruc tions, delivered to the Yamin a formal letter addressed by me to the Persian Commissioners, forwarding a copy of my award, and a map to illustrate the line laid down. Although the details of my award have already been com*'erseatii asesiaili rourtojii .Capfili ctiatlKE Weils proof ei I sicieitr; rice anil laiiiinj e {oorte 'oodiife nutrjsk leirprefe t to iijr an, i {lie i r - tie 9 municated to the Persian Government, and accepted, I considered it advisable to clinch the matter by a formal delivery of the award here and prevent further opportunities of dispute. It was well I did so, for the Yamin at once attempted to wriggle out of the Persian acceptance, by saying it referred only to the line from Bund-i-Kohak to Salgumi, and not to the straight lines north and south thereof. Maula Bakhsh had no difficulty in proving this contention wrong, and reminded the Yamin of his promise never to raise that question again {vide diarv entry of 18th July). The Yamin admitted the force of this and promised not to raise the question again. He went on to lament the injustice done to Persia by Sir Bred. Goldsmid in not giving them Bund-i-Kamal Khan and Tarakun, and to refer to the dangerous position in which Persian Seistan now stands with regard to water. Maula Bakhsh said he thought the Persians ought to be quite accustomed by now to lose water. Why w’ere they making all this fuss over an admittedly fair and impartial award, when they accepted, without a murmur, the iniquitous decisions of Boundary Commissions in the north, whereby Persia not only surrendered to Russia lovely streams and valleys in the Daragez district, but even alienated the right of Persia to use, for cultivation, the w r ater of the upper streams flowing for long distances in Persian territory, and now, again recently, had surrendered nine-tenths of the Hari Rud wa ter at Sarakhs, on the flimsy ground that the Russian population there was increasing, although in summer the whole w r ater of the Hari Rud below ^ Pul-i- Khatun was derived from springs near Naurozabad in Persia, to which the Russians had no right whatever? The poor Yamin had no answer to this beyond the mournful fact that the Amir-i-Kizam, the Persian Commissioner on the Baba-Durmuz-Sarakhs Boundary Commission had accepted bribes, while he, the Yamin, was an honest man. He suggested that w r e should commence demarcation without delay, so that, by working through the fast month of iiamzan, religious obligation to fast mio’ht be avoided. Maula Bakhsh assured him that, although actual demarca tion must be deferred till the Amir s reply comes, I would keep him on the move and prevent his fasting. The Yamin seems to extract one gleam of pleasure out of the present melancholy situation, by the omission in the telegram of all reference to his hitherto colleague, the Karguzar,^ in the matter of signing the protocol. He is going to write and ask the Karguzar whether he has received authority to sign, and if that officer admits he has not, he proposes to inform him that he, the Yamin, is now the sole Persian Commissioner. I expect their correspondence on this point will fully occupy the Yamin’s spare time between this and the commencement of demarcation work. As to the protocol, I do not quite understand what protocol there will be to sign. The Persian Government have affected all along to indirectly ignore the fact that I am an “ Arbitrator ” and to treat this business as a Joint British, Persian and Afghan Commission. I have never seen any record of this idea having been disputed by the British Legation at lehran, and perhaps the necessity for doing so has never arisen. I will, however, consider the question A obtaining the signatures of the Persian and Afghan Commissioners on my award and perhaps final map, after demarcation is completed. i#' Enclosure No. 52.

Goldsmid’s award, i.e., “ the line of frontier from Kohak to the hills south of the Seistan desert should be so drawn as to include within ! lie Afghan limits all cultivation on both hanks of the river from the bund upwards” mean that only the few cultivated portions of land on the bank of the Helm and remain in Afghanistan and that all the rest of the country, including Tarakun, is Persian territory. They maintained that this had been already settled, and no boundary question was, therefore, now in dispute. I refused to admit this argument, and the matter has now, as you will see below, been at last settled. Before stating my award, it is advisable to refer to certain matters which explain my award. You were yourself wdth Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s Mission and know T the difficulties under wdiich he examined and surveyed the country. Major, now General, Beresford Lovett has himself told me that he w'as not able to^go over the country properly, and that his map was, therefore, a very rough map of which the accuracy could not he depended on. As regards Sikbsar andItlial iftii !, | 6 Lionels it irinfomaic L Britkli (k 11 the Kaizar, he says he did not get nearer to that portion of the country than Chakansur. Y ou can realise from this how impossible it was for him to make a correct map. Sir Fred. Goldsmid, moreover, in his award, takes care to sav that this map is only “ illustrative of the country awarded I have found from our present surveys how very inaccurate that award map is. I have followed in my award as much as possible the line shown on that map; but in portions where the mnp has been wrong, 1 have had to be guided by Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s written definition of the boundary line. Another fact to remember is that Sir Fred. Goldsmid did not arrive at any conclusion about the boundary till after he left Seistan. He delivered his award in Tehran several months after he left Seistan. The line which he awarded was never clearly explained on the ground to either the Afghan or Persian officials and people of Seistan. They only received a vague idea of the line from their Governments, and the people actually living near the line were, therefore, obliged to come to some common understanding between themselves as to what they thought the right line was. For many years it has been fairly well understood among the people along both sides of the line that the boundary ran along the Nad Ali channel of the Helmand, thence along the continuation of that channel, i.e., the Sikhsar, as far as that stream-bed could be traced through the Naizar into the Hamun. Cultivation has gradually been extended and villages have gradually been made by both countries nearer and nearer to this line until they reached this line. At the present moment the bed of the Sikhsar represents the boundary between land occupied by Afghan subjects on the one side and Persian subjects on the other, throughout its coarse, except at two places, «.e., near Deh Yar Muhammad where you have recently made a canal from the Sikhsar and irrigated a tract of land on the west of the Sikhsar, which is coloured red on the map and near Ganguzar where the Persians have sown crops to which you have objected on the east of the Sikhsar. These lands are coloured green on the map. You have strongly maintained your right to cultivate land on the west of the Sikhsar on the ground that the real main bed of the Helmand in past times ran in what is now called the Shela-i-Shamshiri. Undoubtedly the main bed of the Helmand did in past times follow the course of the Shela-i-Shamshin, b it this, in my opinion, was before the time of Sir Fred. Goldsmid s Mission. A' the time of his award the main bed of the Helmand followed the Sikhsar channel. I come now to Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s award. The portions.relating to the boundary line are as follows : “ Persia should not possess land on the right of the Helmand. The main bed of the Helmand, therefore, below Nnhak, should be the eastern boundary of Persian Seistan, and the line of frontier from Kohak to the hills south of the Seistan desert should be so drawn as to include within the Afghan limits all cultivation on both banks of thenver from the bund upwards. The Malik Siah Koh, on the chain of hills separating the Seistan from the Kerman desert, appears a fitting point. ISorth of Seistan, t e southern limit of the Naizar, should he the ( frontier towards Lash Juwam Persia should not cross the Hamun in that direction. A line drawn nom Naizar to the Koh Siah Hill near Bandan would clearly define her possession . Interpreting this award with the aid of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s map and &gt; places where I have found that map inaccurate, adapting that award to a ree with a correct map of the country, I lay down the award of which a copy attached to this letter. I send you a map in two parts to illustrate this award. This map is on a scale of 1 nailes=l inch. When the boundary lino been demareatod with boundarv pillars, I will give you a more complete map s ou ^ each nillar. You will see that this boundary line leaves to Afghanistan tne lands cultivated by the new water channel near Deh Yar , an leaves to Persia the lands occupied and cultivated foi many y P F Persian subjects at Takht-i-Shah and Tappa-i-Kaniz. I feel regret at not being able to concede to the many an , |j nQ you and also Musa Khan have made for the inclusion u 1 bv^Sir Fred of Takht-i-Shah. Not only does the definition of the line aw arded y12 {loldsmid prevent my doing this, but I feel sure that to forcibly tahe away from Persia lands which that country has so long occupied and cultivated would undo much of the good which will result from a definite settlement of the Seistan boundary. It is, moreover, to be remembered that Persia can easily irrigate that tract and the Tappa-i-Kaniz land by canals from the Rod-i-Pariun, whereas it is impossible to irrigate them by canals from the Afghan side. Sir Pred. Goldsmid’s definition of the line is very clear. The southern limit of the Naizar shall he the boundary. Takht*i-Shah is on a long strip of land project- in°’ northwards from the main land and wms not in the Naizar at the time of Sir Pred Goldsmid’s award. Takht-i-Shah is a small miserable tract of poor land and, willing as I would he to include it in Afghan territory to meet your many requests if it were in my power to do so, I fail to see how the possession of it would he of any value or use to Afghanistan. As an Arbitrator, I am obliged to act impartially towards both countries concerned, and it has been nq obiect to try and arrive at a boundary line fair to both and one which would not lead to ill-feeling between the people living on either side of it. I feel confident you will yourself admit that the line I have now awarded is a fair and impartial settlement of all present boundary disputes. I have every hope that this award will meet with the approval of His Highness the Amir, when he is informed of it. It now remains to properly demarcate this line with boundary pillars so as to avoid all disputes in future. I trust that no delay will occur in starting that work. Arbitral award given by Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.P., British Commissionir Seistan Arbitration Commission. The boundary line in Seislan between Afghanistan on the east and Persia on the west should run as follows, «.e., from the Malik Siah Koh in a straight line to the Bund-i-Kohak and thence along the bed of the Helmand river to the junction of its two branches, the Rod-i-Pariun and Nad Ali channel. Prom here it should follow the bed of the Nad Ali channel into the Sikhsar and along the bed of the Sikhsar to a point near Deh Yar Muhammad where the Sikhsar has been diverted towards the west in the water channel shown in the map which joins the Shela-i- Shamshiri near to Deh Hassan Kharot. The boundary line should follow the left hank of this ■water channel to the Shela-i-Shamshiri leaving Deh Hassan Kharot on the east. It should then run in a straight line separating the hamlets of DehAli Mardan on the w r est from Deh Ali Jangi on the east to Tappa-i-Tilai; thence in a straight line to the most western of the mounds of Tappa-i-Shaharak; thence in a straight line to the mo-t -western mound of Tappa-i-Kurki; thence in a straight line to Salgumi and thence in a straight line to Siah Koh, Bandan.

Extract from the Diary of Colonel A. II. McMahon, C.S.I., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 16th January 1904. 9th January 1904 .— ******** The boundary line along the Sikhsar passes close to Deh Gul Shah and between it and Deh Yar Muhammad, both of which places are named in my award. It was a disagreeable surprise, therefore, to find some days ago, that Deh Yar Muhammad had bodily disappeared. Seistan villages are most un reliable things, as, owing to the absence of any individual or communal pro prietary rights in land, village communities are not tied down to any particular spot. They may be here to-day, and elsewhere to-morrow. Their villages are of wattle and daub huts which take but little time and trouble to dismantle or reerect. In naming villages in my award I was obliged to risk the contin gency of their disappearance, but I thought the few named would last up to at least the time of demarcation, after which their existence or non-existence becomes immaterial. The Deh Yar Muhammad now referred to has moved some 15 miles south. ***** 11th January, Deh Gul Shah .— I rode along a portion of the boundary line north of this to-day, and was annoyed to find 'that another village, Deh Ali Jangi, named in my award, has also disappeared. Although I know the country well from careful examination of it last spring, it was not until after much searching that I discovered ^ site of the vanished village. I see that the Persians, under Katkhu a Muhammad, have been extending their cultivation widely across, and to the east of, the line which I laid down in my provisional order of last June, and which then divided Persian from Afghan cultivation. The Akhundzada has several times brought these encroachments to my notice, and the Hashmat-ul- Mulk has, at my request, sent, more than once, strict orders to his people forbid ding this. Orders, however, mean nothing m Persian Seistan. The Akhundzada is partly to blame for these encroachments, by allowing the Deh All Jangi village to remove itself. He says he did so, because All Jangi was a wery quarrelsome truculent individual, whose continued residence in that *mghbour- hood would have certainly caused bloodshed, and this he *° a 7 0ld 1 as our Mission is here. The country round Deh All Jangi, Ah Marda^&amp;c., as far as the Tappa-i-Tilai, is dense jungle, without any land marks by which the people can tell how any boundary line runs. I will now have a wide lane cul through the jungle to mark the straight line which forms the 1 bv This will prevent further encroachments pending proper demar y masonry pillars. , 01 # Enclosure No. 61.

Your Highness has not yet favoured me with a reply, and as the hot weather season is again approaching, and the rivers are rising, which will n.ake all demarcation work difficult in Seistan, I shall he obliged if Your Highness will favour me with an early expression of your opinion as regards the boundary. Enclosure No. 62. Extract from the diary of Colonel A. E. McMahon, C.S.I., British Commissioner Seistan Arbitration Commission, for the period ending the 24th January 1904. ******** ISth January, Camp Gul Shah.—The Persians of Deh Ali Mardan and neighbouring villages are still busy ploughing and sowing to the east of my boundary line, and the Afghans are very annoyed at it. The Persians plead the excuse that they cannot tell how the boundary runs through the jungle in that neighbourhood. I went to-day and fixed the two ends of the straight line between I)eh Hassan Kharot and Tappa Tilai, and ordered a wide straight avenue to be cut through the jungle to mark the line. ******** 19th January, Camp Gul Shah. —Pearful howls from the Akhundzada, who sallied forth to-day to inspect the land near Ganguzar. He saw two Persian ploughs working, and returned in high dudgeon. I expressed regret that he had not continued his researches further west, for, if he had, he would have fouud the boundary line clearly defined by an avenue through the jungle. Any ploughing and sowing done by Pe -sians east of that line, would, I said, be Afghan gain. I made the Yamin-i-Nizam send for the village headmen responsible for this continued flagrant encroachment, and he promised to keep them in custody. Instead of doing this, how r ever, he let them go, and they went to the Akhund- zada to try and make terms with him. The lands in question can be irrigated from the Persian side, but not from the Afghan side, and what will happen after final demarcation of the boundary line w ill be that those w r ho have now cultivated those lands will merely step over the border and become Afghan subjects. The sooner the Amir accepts the award, and demarcation is completed, the better, for both the Persian and Afghan Commissioners are working themselves into a nervous and depressed state of mind. The Akhundzada fears he will share the fate of my last Afghan colleague, Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, while the Yamin says everybody is accusing him of taking bribes from me for selling Persian territory. ******** 23rd January, Camp Gul Shah. —The Akhundzada has seemed very rest less and nervous the last few days, and I am firmly convinced he has received unsatisfactory news from Kabul. I sent Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah to see him to-day. He denies the receipt of any letter from the Amir, and, to-day, is in better spirits, owing to a dream which Mulla Samand, an aged Pir of his, who is now in the Afghan camp, has just had. He dreamt that a letter from the Amir of a favourable nature is on the road and will reach us in a few days. The Akhundzada places implicit confidence in this. In the course of conversation, the Akhundzada referred to the bad influence exercised over the Amir by his brother, Nasrulla Khan. He does much to counteract the Amir’s natura leaning towards clemency and generosity, and opposes reform and progress. * * * . * * &gt; *17 chill isli Enclosure No. 63.

My award regarding boundary line postponed, owing to unexpected difficulty brought to light by survey of country between Takht-i-Shah and Siah Koh. I am on the way to Siah Koh to personally inspect country. On arrival here I received a State reception from Governor of Seistan. Persian Commissioners do not accompany me to Siah Koh, as they again raise contention that their instructions do not include already settled question of Seistan boundary, but only water disputes. This will not prevent my delivering award, as, notwithstanding their above contention, they have fully discussed boundary line with me. Question of demarcating line laid down in my award may give trouble owing not only to above contention, but also to abnormally vast inundations which will take months to subside. Will it suffice to define boundary line in writing and map with such detail as to obviate future doubt and enable easy demar cation later on under supervision of British Consul aided by native surveyor when the country becomes accessible and award has been definitely ratified ? Enclosure No. 2. (Confidential.) Extract from Seistan Mission Diary for the period ending the 22nd April 1903. 17th April The Persian Commissioners have at last replied to my letter nf the 15th, and write to say that they have received no instructions about the Perso-Baluch boundary work beyond the telegram, of which they forwarded me extracts in their letter No. 1 of the 24th February (vide diary entry of that date! The explanation they naively assign to this want ot communicativeness on the part of their Government is, that the said Government doubtless considers them fully occupied at the present moment with the Seistan arbitration work, and is waiting to hear of their starting for the Perso-Baluch border before sending instructions. The delay in this reply would show that they have got instructions which Mr. Miller, on being referred to, considers it inadvisable fof 'hem to communicate to me. The Akhundzada and Musa Khan of Herat came to see me in the afternoon, and we had a long business talk. I propound“d to him the boundary line I would be likely to lay down m my award based on my interpretation of General Goldsmid’s award and map as substantiated by local survey and enquiry. This line would separate lands now actually occupied on both sides without necessity for surrender on eUher dde. It involves leaving Takht-i-Shah in Persian territory, as careful ™ shows that that place is not, and never was, m the Naizar, being situated on a y Ion- strip of mainland projecting northwards into the Naizar. The Akhundzada rased less objection than I expected, but expressed grief at my not intending to give an award more favourable to the Afghans even if that invoked a “frge surrender to them of lands occupied and long cultivated by the Persians. &amp; I did my best to explain how such surrender would m the end be more of a curse than a blessing. _ . _ The Akhundzada begged me to extract; fromfte ».. N 7“wed him some time ago, and which showed a boundary line more favourable to the Persians than mine promised to be. * The Yamin says this was an English map which he cm oM of » book of tiMel. ^ H MoMahoBi18th April.—I had intended to-day to propound to the Persians the boundary hue my award would lay down, and then start work forthwith to demarcate it. Mission schemes like others unfortunately have a tendency to “ gang agley ”, and I found this morning to my dismay that the survey of an important tract, albeit a small one, cm the west of Takht-i-Shah, was not to be depended on. It is unwise to risk anything in such cases, and there is nothing for it but to hold up any further propounding of my award until this tract has been definitely surveyed. A surveyor is being despatched there with all haste. Whether the floods will admit of his getting there remains to be seen. It is very aggravating, for, if I had had any inkling of this yesterday, I would have deferred saying anything definite to the Afghans. When the Persian Commissioners came at the hour appointed, I told them that I regretted not being able to express the definite opinions I had intended to, and must await the completion of the survey of a doubtful tract. In the meantime, I said we should visit the Siah Koh, and to-day I would content mvself with hearing their exposition of how they thought the boundary line ran. I first asked them for their map. They said they had not been ^ supplied with one, not even the map which accompanied General Goldsmid’s award. I was prepared for this and expressed no more astonishment at this trifling inaccuracy than mere politeness demanded. They, however, knew the arbitral award well, and the Yamin-i-Isizam was able to repeat passages from memory with fair accuracy, but with a few alterations greatly to the Persian advantage, which had to be pointed out to him and admitted by comparison with the certified copy of the award sent to me from Tehran. They thoroughly under stood General Goldsmid’s award map when I showed them mine, but said the map was only explanatory of the award and not authoritative by itself. Briefly put, their contention is that they base their boundary on the written award, not the map; that northwards the boundary is meant to be calculated from the northern edge of the Naizar, i.e., where the Naizar becomes Hamun, and, as Hamuns are all water, the northern edge of a Hamun is the only tangible point for basing boundary calculations: that eastwards the old Helmand bed is the boundary; that southward the line from the Band-i- Kohak is not a straight one, but intended to be drawn so as to leave on the Afghan side only the present cultivated patches on the river bank such as Mashi, Dak-i-Dehli and Band-i-kamal Khan, thus leaving Tarakun, &amp;c., in Persian territory. I asked them a few questions, ostensibly for my own information^ but in reality to give them a delicate hint that there were other interpretations of Goldsmid’s award which were not quite so favourable to Persian interests. I asked them whether it was true that the real bed of the Helmand in Goldsmid’s * This flows to the west of Deh Dost Muhammad time was the present Shela-i-Shamshiri, and was at some former time the maia bed of the ■phg Naizar then extended to Pukak ? ver ’ a. h. McMahon. and Nad Ali; and that the present Band- i-Kohak is some 1,000 yards higher up the river than it was in 1872. They expressed complete ignorance on these points, and said they would make enquiries. I thanked them, and said I would defer any definite expression of opinion until later. My object is of course to get both sides to abandon any sanguine views they may have formed about my award, so that, if possible, each may think they have scored something when the award is actually given. We are to go to the Siah Koh together as soon as possible. 19th April. —To-day I had a long interview with the Afghan Commis sioner. He brought with him not only Musa Khan, but the “Comedan” of Barrah, the Sartip and Yar Muhammad. He evidently wanted to have witnesses to prove to the Amir that he has done his best to state the Afghan case in a proper manner. I gave him every facility and listened for two hours to a long dissertation on the accuracy and authoritativeness of General Goldsmid s award map, and how the line on that map leaves a large tract of present Persian territory in Afghanistan. He read extracts from letters from His Highness the Amir to the Viceroy in which names of places along the boundary line as claimed are stated. He made the familiar appeal ad misericordiam to*The example of poor Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, my last Afghan colleague, who has been so long in the Kabul jail, has a dispiriting effect on Afghan Commissioners generally, and especially here, where Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, as Chief of the Nurzais of Farrah, has a great name. A. H. McMahon. the effect that any award contrary to such definitions would mean his personal ruin* or death, as indicating want of talent or energy on his part in stating the Afghan case. I made a suitable reply and said what was necessary without hold ing out any hope of being partial to either Afghan or Persian, no matter to what extent my sympathy might he with one more than the other side. I took the opportunity too of pointing out the interpretation the Persians applied to the Goldsmid definition of the line from the Band-i-Kohak to Koh-i-Malik Siah, which, if accepted, would deprive Afghanistan of Tarakun. I was not to be drawn into a premature disclosure of my own opinion on this point. The Akhundzada, with a very small party, is to accompany me to Siah Koh. As the route there by Afghan territory is now impassable, he will have to go with me through Seistan. The Afghan Commissioner and his people have been much impressed with the hospitality shown them by us here. They have been provided with tents and all food for themselves and their horses, and are entertained very handsomely. As the Akhundzada has with him representatives from Herat, Parrah, Kanda har, and is visited daily by headmen from the Helmand districts, the political effect is likely to be widespread. I hear their opinions on the subject are very loud spoken. 20th April .—It has been now arranged that I am to make a State entry into the City on my way to the Siah Koh. The Governor has been unable to come out here and visit me for many reasons, the cumulative force of which cannot be disputed. It is contrary to Persian custom; not authorised by any orders from Tehran; not done in Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s case; very difficult m itself and, moreover, likely to be represented as a mischievous attempt to inter fere in Mission matters. To make up for it, he is to go out of his way, to make my reception at the city one hitherto unknown in Seistan. His two sons and Sardars and all the sowars up to 300 procurable are to meet me some miles out and escort me with led horses and bands to the city and take me through streets lined with infantry to the British Consulate, where the Governor is to call on me that evening, having first sent Mehmani and presents to the value of 10,000 krans. There are to be fireworks that night. So far this is all satisfactory, but the opposition has not been idle, and I am anxiously expecting fresh developments in a new quarter. Enclosure No. 3.

How we are going to get there remains o be seen The present year is one of abnormal flood, and the Hamuns are extend- their margins rapidly day by day, so that a route practicable one day may he D imnassable the next. We hope to cross the Hamun area to Baring, and then skirt the Hamun to Siah Koh. The Persian Commissioners are not coming with me They have, as noted in my diary entry of the 22nd Apnl, again returned to the old argument that their instructions do not include considers- tion of the Seistan boundary line, which has been definitely settled years ago They say they have telegraphed for instructions but I hardly believe this. That their instructions are not quite as they state is proved by the manner in which thev discussed the boundary line with me on the 18th instant and during our visit to Takht-i-Shah, &amp;c. Their present election to accompany me may be due to other causes, of which one is a disinclination to undergo hardships; another is the difficulty of getting transport, as the Governor so far seems to have given them none.

Telegram, No. 343, dated Camp, the 23rd (despatched from Dalbandin on the 28th) May 1903. From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Present position of arbitration work is as follows :— Persian Commissioners still maintain that want of instructions beyond those communicated to me in their letter No. 6 {vide enclosure No. 3 of my letter No. 589 of 15th March) prevents their discussing the question of boundary line. A further letter from me has been several days unanswered, and I understand reference has been made to Tehran. Meanwhile, I have laid responsibility of delay on their shoulders. Karguzar privately informs me that present obstruction is due to Yamin acting under guidance of Miller, to whom he refers my letters for instructions. I do not feel necessarily bound to delay giving my award on boundary line owing to above contention, as I have given the Persian Commissioners ample opportunities for verbally discussing subject; but I propose delaying award temporarily. Chief advantage of giving early award on boundary line would be to give both countries an opportunity to appeal during period in which actual demarcation is impossible, owing to floods, and admit of demarcation later in accordance with final decision on that award. My award on water questions is, in any case, delayed until we can ascertain what changes in relative sizes of river beds and canals have been caused by existing floods. I propose keeping latter award entirely distinct from award on boundary line. Everything, therefore, indicates pro longed duration of arbitration work; and if, as I am informed, Seistan summer wind is too strong for tents, I may have to build huts for camp. I deprecate any reduction of Mission strength during the duration of Mission, however long, but I advocate main camp spending summer at Sar-i-Bisha near Birjand, or slope of the Koh-i-Taftan, if Persian Government could be induced to sanction this.

Please refer to Your Lordship’s telegram of the 27th May.

But please see his diary for the period 17th to 19th April, sent with the Eoreign Secretary’s letter of the 14th May. Takht-i-Shah is the place mentioned in my letter to the Amir, dated the 24th November 1902, and it was presumably with reference to the Afghan claim to this place that Colonel McMahon visitea the country between it and Siah Koh. The Persian Commis sioners accompanied him to Takht-i-Shah and discussed the boundary—mte Colonel McMahon’s diary of 27th March. The instructions referred to in my telegram of the 23rd May were those which I gave to Colonel McMahon orally in Simla before he started. I expressly agreed that, to obviate further dispute the line to Siah Koh should be definitely demarcated. We have always’contemplated that Colonel McMahon’s arbitration should deal with all disputes regarding the Seistan boundary. Our letters to the Amir and His Highness’s replies to me have shown this, and Afghan claims must be consi dered equally with Persian. Please see the following correspondence:— rrwi«rt.Y»a™e fmm His Britannic Maiesty’s Charge d’Aftaires at Tehran, dated the8 rifflits Youi- Lordship’s telegram of the 5th August 1902 contained no mention of the water dispute, but referred to alleged Afghan encroachments l ocVerl tliat overt preparations should he made for arbitration, which plifhal invoked. Sir Irthur Hardinge’s telegram of the 9th March says the Seistan authorities had been required to submit their case regarding frontier question and water to the arbitrator m wntmg Pmally, Lord Lansdowne’s telegram of the 9th March instructed Sir Arthur Hardinge to arrano-e for delimitation to commence at once on the basis described in my tele-ram of the 3rd March. The latter telegram said that only one Persian Commissioner was required to state the case for the Pemian Government both as regards irrigation disputes and the infringement of boundary, of which Persia complained, and that the Afghan case would be similarly represented by one official. , . . . , . It is clear, therefore, that from the beginning arbitration has been directed at the request of Persia, with Afghan knowledge, and under the authority of His Majesty’s Government, to frontier as well as water disputes, and that it is now impossible, and would be most unwise to confine it to the latter The result would he the alienation of the Amir and the certain revival of friction in future.

Hardinge, and that, if there is any further delay, the Yamin, who has violated the conditions upon which alone we consented to his appointment (wie Lord Lansdowne’s telegram No. 28 of the 24th March), should be recalled and the Kargnzar left as sole Persian Commissioner.

A±.\J LX i There is great difficulty in getting information owing to all this country being uninhabited, except by wandering graziers who are an unsociable lot difficult to find and still more so to catch. 2nd May .—Regardless of the expostulations of the Sultan and his men, who swore singly and collectively that there was no water for two whole days* marches in that direction, that the route was impassable for camels, and so on, we started off in the direction of Bandan. A grazier caught yesterday says there is water at a day’s march at a place called Chah-i-Mago, to which he is to guide us. We had ridden for some fifteen miles, and the stout Sultan, who dislikes these hot marches, had fallen some way behind when the welcome sight of two black blanket tents hidden in a dip indicated the presence of a grazing encampment, and there we pounced upon two men who it turned out were regular annual residents here and know every hill and peak by name. These were very annoyed when we persisted in calling the Koh-i-Chako, Siah Koh, and said that we were entirely wrong, as there was only one Siah Koh in these parts, a high peak which they pointed out to the north-west. Asked why a peculiarly yellow coloured hill should be called Siah Koh (the black hill), they expressed contemptuous surprise at our ignorance, and said it was so called as it was the hill to which the countryside went for Makk ”, an earth which when burnt made the black dye used in dyeing their blankets and carpets. They told us also that we would find a large lake of fresh rain flood water near the Siah Koh at Daghal-i-Chah Kushan, to which they w^ould guide us. At about 24 miles we got there and found a shallow lake about tw^o miles long and half-mile wide, on the bank of which we camped. The Sultan takes the new Siah Koh philosophically. He now says all hills in this country are Siah Kohs. 3rd May .—Eight miles brought us to the foot of the Siah Koh, a high isolated mountain standing out of the plain. Two hours’ stiff climb brought us to the top. A valley some four miles wide separates this mountain from the Koh-i-Bandan range, and it is about eight miles from the Bandan village. Its position would, therefore, appear to fit in with General Goldsmid’s definition. We obtained a very extensive view from the summit. We found our camp pitched at Tabbassain, a small hamlet near Zain-ul- Abad, about five miles away. The hard exercise of the last few days is having a marked effect on the Sultan’s figure, but he is still cheery and loots a little something or other from e'very encampment he meets. 4th May, Tabbassain .—We halted to-day to enable Mr. Tate and his surveyors to complete their work. Further enquiries only tend to corroborate the fact that our hill is the Siah Koh. The Tabbassain people, however, also know it as Koh-i-Kurku. Many hills in these parts seem to have two names, but this is common everywhere. * * Enclosure No. 16. {Extract.) Telegram, No. 79, dated the 2nd June 1903.

At Sar-i-Bisheh, or some point further south, he would be on Meshed-Seistan telegraph line, and could utilise one of the signallers sent from India, and he could send the other signaller to Birjand, which would balance the Kussian signaller who is said to be working at Turbat-i-Haideri. Repeated to Colonel McMahon. Enclosure No. 19. Extract from Seistan Mission Diary for the period ending 16th M.ay 1903. ******** Yesterday I wrote to the Persian Commissioners asking for a written state ment of the Persian case as regards the question of the Seistan boundary line n ..i,. and water disputes. A reply* received * No. 11, dated the 16th May 1903. , , , . . i-i ' L rc • i i to-day states that, m the official letter addressed by the Persian Foreign Minister to the British Minister at Tehran, the condition was laid down that the boundary settlement of Sir Fred. Gold- smid was in no way to be infringed, and that their (Persian Commissioners’) representations and my Mission have been confined to the difference of the Helmand water. They then proceed to enumerate four instances, in which the Afghans have in recent years made new canals in infringement of the Goldsmid award. I hardly think the Persians have any wish to prolong the duration of this Mission, but nothing can be more productive of delay than arguments of this nature. Enclosure No. 20.

I have telegraphed as follows to the Foreign Office to-day Please see your telegram No. 55. The Persian Government’s appeal to us was provoked by the water question, and they are anxious to keep the arbitra-tion to it. But we can extend its scope, if the Government of India deem it expedient so long as we confine it to Goldsmid line, on the ground that the Afghans have made counter-complaints against encroachments by the Persians in violation of Goldsmid award. This is the ground on which I have defended our right to do so, as yet unofficially only to Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who has received an autograph from the Shah insisting, in connection with McMahon’s visit to Bandan, that the arbitration should be confined to the Helmand water question. Looking at the question from a Persian point of view, my own inclination would he to limit the scope of the arbitration as much as possible, but under- standin 0 * from the Viceroy’s telegram that its effect on our relations with the Amir was also an important consideration, I have adopted his line of argument in a conversation with a Persian Foreign Office representative sent to see me on the subject, pointing out that the note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mons. des Graz did not expressly limit arbitration to the water question.

Extracts from Seistan Mission Eiary for the 'period ending 24th May 1903. 17th May 1903, Khwaja Ahmad .—The Karguzar paid a visit to-day to Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh. He complained of the difficulty of his posi tion in being associated with the Yamin-i-Nizam, who is working under Bussian instructions in Russian interests and making himself as obstructive as possible. The Yamin, he said, had made misrepresentations to Tehran against all the Seistan officials, and made the Persian Government suspicious of every one except the Yamin himself. He, the Karguzar, did his best to expedite our work, but had to give in in many cases for fear of the Yamin through Russian influence poisoning the mind of the Persian Government against him. So far they had received no instructions beyond those communicated by them to us, and those instructions laid stress on the maintenance of the Goldsmid bound ary settlement without any alteration; but the Karguzar admitted that this did not preclude discussion of that boundary line, and he quite realised that its proper definition was the principal business of this Mission, and of the utmost importance. He suggested my writing to them to demand their interpret ation of the Goldsmid line, as this would give him an opportunity of bringing pressure on his colleague. He added that he had every reason to believe that the Yamin-i-Nizam sent copies of all our correspondence to Mr. Miller, and on this account he feared grave difficulties in our work. ******** 18th May, Kdiwaja Ahmad .—I wrote to the Persian Commissioners in reply to their letter of the 16th. I pointed out how impossible it was to settle water disputes without first defining the position of the boundary line. I showed how I had urged them ever since the 22nd February to ask for further instructions more in accordance with mine, which they appear not to have done. I asked them for their definition on the ground of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s bound ary line, and said that I proposed to demarcate the line wherever necessary. In the meantime their want of instructions was, I said, causing regrettable delay in the completion of our work.13 &amp; X It shows, I think, a lack of astuteness on the part of sioners and their Russian advisers to bring the blame of the Persian Commis- delay so entirely on themselves. ******** 20th May, Khwaja Ahmad .—Still no reply to my letter of the 18th to the Persian Commissioners. ******** The Yamin-i-Nizam went into the city to-day, doubtless to consult Mr. Miller regarding the reply which should he sent to my letter of the 18th. ******** f# a visit tw Enclosure No. 28.

I would ask Your Lordship to permit me to await a further communication from the Persian Government before raising the question of the scope of the arbitration officially. I would let Colonel McMahon quietly collect all the materials for his award, which, judging from what I hear privately from Major Douglas, will probably be acceptable to the Persians, the only doubtful point being Takht-i-Shah, a compromise as to which should not be difficult. If I say nothing beyond the verbal statements already made by me, the matter may rest, but if I raise it officially in a note which will have to be laid before the Shah, His Majesty mav give some foolish order which will create a lot of difficulties, and afford a handle to the Russians for fresh intervention. The Persian Government have been informed by me that the complaints made by the Afghans of the violation of the Goldsmid line must be heard as well as theirs, and I would rather not emphasise the point at present, unless they return to the charge.

I have already noted the substance of the verbal representations you have made on these points. Translation of a letter from the Persian Commissioners, to Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.L, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner and Arbitrator for the Persian- Afghan Boundary in Seistan, No. 11, dated the 16th May 1903. After compliments .—We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed letter No. 13 P.P., dated the 15th May 1903. According to the official letter addressed by the Foreign Ministry of our Government to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, this condition was made that the boundary settlement of the time of General Goldsmid’s Mission should in no way he infringed, and our representations and your mission has been confined to the question of the difference in the Helmand water. We have, therefore, the honour to state as follows:— Istly .—Last year the Afghans dug a canal above, i.e., south of, the Bund- i-Seistan, from a place called Koshk. This canal is always inju rious to the cultivation of Seistan, except when the river is brim-full, hence it is in contravention of General Goldsmid’s settlement, and should he condemned and abandoned. 2ndly .—During the last three or four years, the Afghans have newly made below, i.e., to the north of, the Bund-i-Seistan, two or three bunds (dams) called Bund-i-Jaroki and Bund-i-Paryan, &amp;c. These are also injurious to the cultivation of Seistan and in contravention to the said settlement, and should he abolished and removed. 3rdly .—For the last year or two, at the time when w r e are in urgent need of water, the Afghans have been, without any legal reason, blocking up the head of the canal of Deh Dost Muhammad Khan, which canal has been in use for irrigation and cultivation in the said village for over 25 years, and thereby causing loss and trouble to the people of the said village. They should withhold their hand from these actions, so that it may not he necessary to place a guard at the head of the said canal and difficulties may not be created, because this is also in contravention to the settlement. 4thly .—Near Deh Gul Shah, which place was pointed out to you at the time of the tour on the frontier, the Afghan official, at the time of the dislocation of the Zabit (official in charge) of the said Mahal (district) changed the natural course of the Helmand by digging an artificial canal, and having without any right taken possession of some of the land belonging to, and cultivated by, the Persian Government, cultivated it under the names of Deh Bahlal, Deh Ali Jangi, and Deh Hassan. As this is also in contravention to the former settlement and continuous rights, it should he given up and restored, because after General Goldsmid’s settlement and delimitation more than 32 years have elapsed, and during this period no disagreement has taken place. These high-handed proceedings and actions on part of the Afghans have been commenced and innovated since three or four years only.We have the honour to hope that your goodself will, as required by your mission, arrange for the rectification of these trifling matters, and the speedy removal of the above-mentioned new structures. 1 J Translation of a letter from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Special Commissioner and Arbitrator for Persian-Afo’han Boundary in Seistan, to the Persian Commissioners, No. 14 P.P., dated the 18th May 1903. After compliments .—I have received your esteemed letter No. 11, dated the 16th May 1903, and am astonished to find that you still maintain that the work of this Arbitration Commission is confined solely to the question of difference in the Helmand water. You are already in possession of a copy of the Royal Commission issued to me by His Majesty King Edward, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Emperor of India. In that Commission you are aware that I have been appointed for the following purpose, i.e., “of settling a dispute which has arisen between the Governments of Persia and Afghanistan, regarding the Seistan boundary and matters connected therewith’ , . I have, on former occasions, from the 22nd Eebruary onwards, asked you, as your instructions were not in accordance with those issued to me, to refer the matter to your Govern ment, and from what you now write it would appear that you have not done so. You are well aware that questions of boundary, as well as water, are in dispute, and, moreover, the complaint No. 4 against the Afghans in your letter under reply, is itself one of a disputed boundary line. Tim Afghans on their part claim that Persians have in places not respected the line laid down by Sir Frederic Goldsmid. I know that the Persian Government have laid stress on the condition that the boundary settlement laid down by Sir Frederic Goldsmid should not be infringed. You may be assured that I have no intention of altering Sir Frederic Goldsmid’s settlement. The disputes regarding the Seistan boundary have arisen owing to misunderstanding on both sides regarding the real position on the ground of the line which Sir Frederic Goldsmid decided and laid down on his map. It is, therefore, necessary to ascertain and define on the ground how Sir Frederic Goldsmid’s boundary line runs. Until this is done, how can questions of water, inseparable from the boundary question, be decided ? What is your interpretation of the position on the ground with regard to various places on either side of it, of Sir Frederic Goldsmid’s boundary line? When you receive necessary authority from your Government to assist me in settling the boundary question, I will give my arbitral award on that point, and will, under the general authority given me in the Royal Commission referred to above, demarcate where necessary on the ground how Sir Frederic Goldsmid’s boundary line runs, so that there may be no misunderstanding regarding it in future. I will then be in a position from the careful surveys, observations, and measurements that have been made, and are still being made, to give my award in the matter of water disputes. I regret that your want of necessary instructions is causing delay in the final settlement of these questions, as delay at this season of the year must cause considerable inconvenience to all concerned. Enclosure No. 31. Telegram, No. 361, dated Camp Kuhak, the 15th (despatched from Dalbandin on the 20th) June 1903. From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. A collision occurred between Afghan and Persian cultivators about three days ago over crops on disputed land near Siksar, and Afghan Commissioner reports that three Afghans were wounded, and one horse killed; that attack was unprovoked, but Afghans, obeying orders, did not retaliate. 1 ave no16 heard Persian version of affair, but to prevent further collision, otherwise inevitable, I have defined a line through tract in question, and informed Persian and Afghan Commissioners that Persian and ^ Afghan subjects are not to interfere in land or water beyond their own side of that line until further orders. Above line is that which I have hitherto intended laying down in my arbitration award. Letter follows. Please repeat to Tehran. Enclosure No. 32.

It is impossible for me to decide water disputes without first deciding boundary line. My order of yester- dav to Commissioners, reported in my telegram No. 361 of to-day, necessitates seeing boundary line definitely settled and demarcated. I am submitting full report regarding line in that neighbourhood, which will enable matter to be definitely thrashed out and settled at Tehran, thereby dispelling present base less anxiety regarding arbitration fostered by Russians and their Persian Agents.

I have the honour to forward, for information, a copy of letter No. 12, dated the 4th June 1903, from the Persian Commissioner, in reply to my letter No. 14 of the 18th May 1903. 2 . I understand that the full text of my letter No. 14, dated 18th May, has been telegraphed to Tehran, and that a reply from Tehran is awaited. 3. A copy of this letter and enclosure, also a copy of the Persian original of the latter, is being forwarded to the British Minister at Tehran. Translation of a letter from the Persian Commissioners to Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Special Commissioner and Arbitrator for the Persian-Afghan Boundary in Seistan, No. 12, dated the 4th June 1903. After compliments .—We had the honour of receiving your esteemed letter No. 14 P.P., dated 18th May 1903, and telegraphed its contents to Tehran. We have received no further reply as yet, and, according to the instructions of our Government, we cannot at present, under any circumstances whatever, carry on any discussion regarding the delimitation of the boundary. The question of the division of the water has got nothing to do with delimitation, or a fresh modification of the boundaries. You are in possession of a copy of the telegram sent to us by the Persian Eoreign Minister with the knowledge of the Legation of your Government. Our present instructions are confined to that telegram, and it is not possible for us to deviate one atom from the obligations and orders of our Government. You say that paragraph 4 of the representations in our letter No. 11 is a boundary dispute. If it is carefully observed, we have complained against the change from the natural channel into an artificial and new channel which is contrary to the award of General Goldsmid’s arbitration. In case the water should flow into its natural channel, no boundary dispute will be left. There- fqre this paragraph 4 is dependent on, and concerns the question of, the division of water and the maintenance of its former and original channel.With regard to your enquiry as to the points on the two sides of the boundary as considered by us, our reply is only this, that whatever now is, and has been, in the possession of the Persian Government since the last thirty-two years, viz*, the date of the Goldsmid arbitration, clearly shows the boundaries which you have inspected and seen. The boundaries of Seistan are:— On the east, the Helmand. On the north, the Hamuns, and the Siah Koh of Bandan. In proof of this statement we append separately, to this letter, a copy of the firman which has been issued to us, and which is contained in a telegram from the Persian Poreign Ministry. Translation of the ShaVs firman regarding onr appointment, which was communicated to us in You, the Yamin-i-Nizam and the Karguzar, are permitted to mention the statements of the Persian Government to Major McMahon, the honoured Agent (Mamur) of the British Government, and give him a written copy thereof. The principal and important questions which should be specified will be these : that the boundaries of Seistan and Afghanistan have been fixed at the time of Goldsmid’s Mission, and those boundaries and settlement should on no account be altered. The question which is now pending is the change in the channel of the Helmand and differences regarding water, and the Persian Gov ernment have, in an official letter which they addressed to the British Legation at Tehran, made the principle of this arbitration conditional on this condition, that it should in no way be contrary to the boundary settlement of Goldsmid’s time.

(6) Mr. Miller asked the Mustan-ul-Mumalik the other day, when he met him in the city, why the British Mission were ^ showing no signs of departing. Knowing that Mr. Miller was kept acquainted with ^ our corre spondence, he replied that the Persian Commissioners were delaying Mission work by not answering reasonable questions and by not co-operating in the settlement of pending questions. Mr. Miller made no further remarks. This evening I received a letter from the Persian Commissioneis, in which they say they have referred my letter to Tehran and are awaiting a reply. They repeat that water disputes have no connection with the boundary question. They also ask permission to call on me. ******* The Persian Commissioners this evening paid me a long and friendly visit. They did not broach business matters, and I abstained from doing so. It is useless discussing business until they hear from Tehran, and, in any case, I am glad to let matters stand as they are until the bearings of the present situation are more completely comprehended by all concerned. .. ** At- Enclosure No. 38. Extract from Seistan Mission Diary for the period ending the 8th June 1903. ******** 1st June 1903, Kohak. —Mr. Ward started to-day for a lengthy tour on the Afghan side of the Helmand. The Akhundzada has willingly consented to a careful irrigation survey of the large tract of country on the east bank of the Helmand from Chahar Burjak downwards, to include all the wide area of country inhabited in ancient times up to the edge of the Dasht-i- Margo including Sar-o-Tar, Amiran, &amp;c. This desert tract was evidently in old times the richest and most prosperous portion of Seistan. It is altogether beyond the power of tne Afghan Government to reclaim this tract, but a slight improvement of their present canal system in the north-west corner of it would increase their present cultivated area.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Your telegrams Nos. 1639 and 1689 of 12th and loth June. After careful consideration and in consequence of recent collision between Persians and Afghans, which I believe to have been an unprovoked attack by Persians due to outside instigation, I think it advisable for myself and main camp to remainin Seistan, where I am in close touch with Afghan and Persian officials, and where I can ensure rapid communication by post and telegraph with India. Persian telegraphic terminus now withdrawn to Neh, a very hot undesirable place, for the summer. Extension of telegraph line to Seistan postponed until the winter. Nearest point on line, where our own summer quarters could be raised, is Shusp. I could, if permission he arranged in Tehran, send a camp of so-called invalids there, but they would he of little real use, as there are several roads into Seistan which avoid Shusp and telegraph line route. On the other hand, if necessity arose, it would be easy for us to stop any undesirables entering Seistan, which is now practically an island. Our presence in Seistan is likely to be more disconcerting to Russian plans than if we were anywhere outside it. Enclosure No. 40. Telegram, dated the 29th June 1903.

I would send the greater part to Koh-i-Taftan, which is closer to our own frontier, and where the presence of a large body of Indian troops and camp followers would arouse less suspicion and attention.

Whyte telegraphs report that the B/ussians intend stationing their military signallers at principal points on telegraph line between Seistan and Meshed, under the orders of an officer, who will have his head-quarters at Seistan. On 22nd June, Colonel McMahon telegraphed that the extension of the telegraph line to Seistan has been postponed till the winter, and that the telegraph terminus has been with- drawn for the present to Neh. I have told Colonel McMahon that there is no necessity for sending any one to Koh-i-Taftan, but that he might send some men to Shusp, leaving the main body in Seistan, and that it is very desirable to get our signallers established, as quickly as possible, at head of telegraph line. He originally proposed that his main camp should summer on slope of Koh-i-Taftan, or at Sar-i-Bisheh near Birjand, but abandoned this proposal in consequence of the collision, reported in my telegram of 23rd June, between the Afghans and Persians. Colonel McMahon now thinks it desirable that his main camp should be left in Seistan. Seistan Enclosure No. 45. No. 824, dated Camp Kohak, the 16th June 1903 (Confidential). From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for information, a copy of a letter written by the Afghan Commissioner for my information to his brother Mulla Yar Muhammad Khan and a copy of a letter No. 15 P. P., dated 14th June 1903, addressed by me to the Persian and Afghan Commissioners. 2. As to the nature and extent of the recent collision between the Afghans and Persians, I have not as yet accurate information. It is not in itself an important incident, except as marking the facts that disputes regarding the boundary line do exist, and that they cause local friction, which, _ it unchecked, would lead to very serious results. As to the wisdom of taking steps to prevent such incidents while arbitration is pending, there can he little doubt. This is the third complaint made to me by the Governor of Chakansnr regarding Persian encroachment since this Mission has been in Seistan, and it has become imperatively necessary to take some step to allay Afghan impatience. The order I have now issued to both parties is likely to have the desired effect locally, and prevent further collisions. The order may, however, raise other questions elsewhere. A few words of explanation seem necessary, therefore, to show how the matter stands as regards the boundary question. 3. To explain the case I attach a tracing of a survey, scale 1 inch— 1 mile, of the country in question.4. The Sikhsar channel of the Helmand by the time it reaches Deh Yar Muhammad is a small stream only 2 or 3 feet wide. Prom Deh Yar Muham mad the Afghans a year or so ago dug a small ditch, carrying off all the water of this stream as shown on the map to cultivate the land between Deh Yar Muhammad and Deh Hassan Kharot. 5 . The Persians contend that the dry channel a small ditch about two feet wide and two deep, which is shown in the map as the prolongation of the Sikhsar channel northwards into the Naizar, marks the main bed of the Helmand laid down as the boundary by Sir Ered. Goldsmid. Eor further details regarding this tract reference should be made to my diary entries of 26th, 26th, and 28th March. 6 . The Afghan Commissioner contends that the old main bed of the Helmand followed the dry channel now known as the Shela-i-Shamshiri, and that, therefore, all land to the east of that is Afghan territory. Undoubtedly the main bed of the Helmand in past times did run in the Shela-i-Shamshiri channel, but how long ago it ceased to do so is now very difficult to definitely ascertain. There is reason to believe that at the time of Sir Ered. Goldsmid’s award the main bed followed the Sikhsar channel, Deh Dost Muhammad and other important villages in the tract between the Shela-i-Shamshiri and Sikhsar channels are all of recent date within the last 25 years or so, and are all Persian. The Afghan villages on the east of the Sikhsar are also, with the exception of Kila-i-Kang, of recent date. Among the local people, Persian and Afghan alike, the Sikhsar appears to have long been recognised as the boundary line. 7 . In old days almost the whole of Miankangi appears to have been Naizar which gradually receded until it reached the position shown on the attached map, and I am of opinion that this was its position at the time of Sir Ered. Goldsmid’s award. Owing, however, to the Helmand cutting out for itself the Kod-i-Parian channel, the Naizar, into which the Sikhsar flowed, has since dried up, and is only distinguishable from other land by absence of tama risk jungle and presence of old dried reed stumps and roots. 8 . Assuming the Sikhsar channel to be Sir hied. Goldsmid s line, we find between Deh Yar Muhammad and the Naizar the Afghans in occupation of a small tract of poor worthless land on the west of it, a.e., the area to the east of the new water channel from Deh Yar Muhammad, and including the wretched small Afghan hamlets of Deh Hassan Kharot and Ah Jangi. It is here that the recent fracas took place. The Goldsmid line, according to the definition of the award, then follows pdo-p nf the Naizar which, as now ascertained by careful survey, runs as ^wnTn the attaS’i to’a point just north of Takht-i-Shah, from whence, I understand, the straight line to Siah Koh should take off. The Persians have encroached beyond this line by pushing patches o noor cultivation into the Naizar as shown in the map, notably at Tappa-i-Kamz, &amp; ttret a Persian village several years' old rich cultivation watered by canals from the west. Ike Persian encroachments exceed those of the Afghans in extent and importance. o To follow strictly the Goldsmid line would necessitate making the AfghansTurrendOT the lands of Deh Hassan Kharot and and ^ Persians the lands in the Naizar and at T ^ PP ^tf ta t he Afchaiis because ^ west &gt; whrie th&lt;; Af§hans have no means of irrigating them. 10. It appearsreasonableto t-atthe tweets o^ncro^chments as a set- fcuplTby both sides.''' iTwill be seen that the intermediate order I have issued lays down such a hne. demarea ting in a low level tract liable 11 Northwards the difflculty f jX for ^fghbouring and permanent to inundation makes 14 adv . ls ^ e . * u n e of prominent mounds or “tappas”, landmarks. These are furnishe y } 10 uld follow these, i.e., in a series and I am of opinion that the boundary line shoulder o{ of straight lines from Tappa-i-Tillai to the most western22 TanDa-i-Shaharali to the Tappa-i-Kurki, and thence to the point Salgumi just north of Takht-i-Shah. The land round all these tappas is sour salt soil of no value. , T ± ^ • 12 It will thus be seen that the line I propose to fix m my award between Deb Yar Muhammad and Takht-i-Shah differs but only slightly from the line defined by Sir Fred. Goldsmid, or, to speak more correctly, the line which careful survey of the country shows to be a fair and impartial interpret- ation of Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s definition of the boundary. Also that the difference as regards area is more to Persian than Afghan advantage. 13 In this small section only, i.e., from Feh Yar Muhammad to Takht-i- Shah, a distance of some 13 miles, does the line I propose to define in my award differ from the line defined by Sir Fred. Goldsmid. It will be a line reo'ardino* which future doubts cannot well arise, and is one which should he acceptable to both sides. As regards the people living in its neighbourhood on both sides, it involves no change of existing conditions, and will cause no ill-feeling or unpleasantness. 14. My action either past or proposed affords no justification for the fears and anxietv which have been instilled into the minds of His Highness the Shah and Persian Government regarding changes contemplated by our arbitra tion in Sir Fred. Goldsmid’s boundary line. For such needless anxiety, I regret to say, one of the Persian Commissioners, the Yamin-i-Nizam, is largely responsible, as he appears to have devoted more time and attention to inventing and reporting to Tehran incorrect assumptions of sinister intentions on my part than to trying to ascertain actual local conditions or my views relating thereto. 15. The same reasons which led hitherto to consistent misrepresentations at Tehran regarding arbitration will doubtless cause a violent outcry at Tehran against the intermediate arbitral order now issued by me. ^ I have, therefore, clearly stated above existing facts, and have described the line which I mean to lay down in my arbitral award, unless I obtain hereafter fresh evidence on doubtful points which would necessitate reconsideration of such line. I do not foresee at this advanced stage of enquiry much likelihood of that. It mio-ht be well, therefore, if any outcry be made at Tehran against this order, to put the matter clearly as above stated to the Persian Government and dispel not only present baseless anxiety on their part, but obtain acceptance of the line therein defined and thereby remove what would otherwise prove a ground for subsequent appeal against my award and consequent delay in the demarca tion of the line. 16. As regards the Afghan attitude on this point, I have every reason to believe that the Afghan Commissioner will carry out my order without demur. A formal protest will doubtless be made from Kabul hereafter ^ against the inclusion of Takht-i-Shah in Persian territory, but this is not likely to be a strenuous one, as the fact of Takht-i-Shah being in Persian possession has for many years been recognised by local Afghan officials here, and none of them have ever entertained hopes of obtaining possession of it. I might note, too, that Takht-i-Shah is a small and miserable tract of indifferent land amongst sandhills, which even if in Afghan possession would not be irrigated by them. 17. A copy of this letter and enclosures is being forwarded to the British Minister at Tehran. Translation of a letter,* from Fakir Muhammad, Akhundzada, to his brother, Mulla Yar Muhammad Khan, without date. After compliments .—On the 9th instant, I received a letter from Kadkhuda Madad Khan, Kadkhuda Sherjan Khan, and other Kadkhudas reporting as follows :— “ Kadkhuda Dost Muhammad Ali Khan sent his brother, Nur Muhammad, with a large party to interfere with Sikhsar land, the cultivated territory or the God-granted Government. The latter came and having taken the water through the Naizar, turned it on to the land which was cultivated last year y * Note .—This letter was presented by Mulla Yar Muhammad Khan on 14th June.

On receiving information we went there to enquire of them the reason of this high-handedness. Before we approached them, they suddenly fired on us, wounding three men and killing one horse, hut as we, the people of this side, had no permission to fight and quarrel, we did not stretch our feet beyond the path of our obedience. Our sense of honour of our religion and Government, however, made us keep our firm feet steady in the field, and with shrill cries of great exultation we turned the reins of our determination towards the enemy, who on seeing this felt the field narrower than an elephant’s eye for them, took to flight and effected their escape ”. Not being satisfied with their letter, I sent for them and interrogated them. They corroborated the same facts. It has, therefore, become necessary that you should explain this matter to His Britannic Majesty’s Commissioner, and say that, notwithstanding the appointment of peace-making representatives of the friendly powerful Govern ments for the settlement of the affairs of the frontier who have for some time past been engaged in turning their good efforts towards arranging the affairs of the frontier as required by justice, may God forbid, that any controversy or quarrel should take place between the high Governments. Why should Seistanis commit such unreasonable acts which are in no way justifiable ? In case Kadkhuda Dost Muhammad Ali Khan has committed such improper acts contrary to the friendly relations existing between the two high Governments, at the instance of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, it does not matter. If they pay no heed to the representatives of such high rank and become so absorbed in ignorance as to openly commit high-handedness, the Afghans, who have always so far spread the chains of forbearance in the field of battle, are waiting for such days. Since, however, preordaining firmans have been uninter ruptedly and repeatedly issued by his August Boyal and Imperial Majesty to me, the servant of the ever-lasting Government, to the effect that I should always maintain friendly and good neighbourly relations and never show any unfriendly spirit or treatment, I have faithfully acted on the orders contained in these August firmans, and have always tried to show a friendly and good neighbourly spirit in all matters. Neither party should listen to the utterances of ignorant triflers and act ing on the advice of acute and prudent men, they should exercise forethought, and exert themselves in strengthening the ties of friendship between the two high Governments. Please obtain a reply to this communication from His Britannic Majesty’s Commissioner and inform the Karguzar* of the matter. Translation of a letter from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner and Arbitrator for Persian-Afghan Boundary in Seistan, to the Persian Commissioners, No. 15 P. P., dated Camp Kohak, the 14th June 1903. After compliments .—It has been reported to me to-day that a quarrel regarding land has recently taken place between Persian and Afghan cultivators at a place in the neighbourhood of Deh Yar Muhammad and Ali Mardan. Three Afghan cultivators are said to have been wounded by gun bullets and one horse killed. It is unnecessary to state that such incidents should not be allowed to take place while disputes between Afghanistan and Persia are under course of settlement. The only way of preventing such occurring in places where the position of the boundary line is open to doubt, is for me to use the powers that have been entrusted to me as arbitrator. I therefore issue the following order, i.e., that, until further orders or until final settlement of arbitration work, Persian subjects should not be allowed to interfere with water or land on the east side of the following line, i.e., the line followed by the water channel recently constructed by Afghans from a point between Deh Yar Muhammad and Deh Shah Gul to where that channel joins the Shela-i-Shamshiri near to and leaving Deh Hassan Kharot on the east. Thence it runs in a straight line, dividing the hamlets off Deh Ali Mardan on * Note .—Khan Bahadur Mir Shams Shah. A. H. McMahon.xr. 4 - f.nm Ali Jan^i on the east to Tappa-i-Tilai. Similarly, no Af-hansubjectfare to interfere with land or water on the west of that line. ° This line is the line separating the lands under actual occupation of Persian and Af-han subjects, respectively, at the time of my inspection of the country. Aconvof this letter is being sent direct to the Afghan Commissioner and Governor of Chakansur, and a copy is herewith sent for the Governor of Seistan, information arid favour of issue of necessary orders to all persons concerned. The responsibility for acts of their subjects beyond this line will rest with the Governors concerned. Enclosure No. 46. 7 Tehran. 7 ’ . 5th Mav 1903. Sir I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch which I have addressed to Colonel McMahon, with reference to his despatch to the Govern ment of India of the 18 th of March last, a copy of which he was good enough to send me, respecting the seizure by the Seistan Customs of property belonging to his mission. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, A. Hardinge. The Secretary to the Government of India in the Eoreign Department. Tehran, Sir, 4th May 1903. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 597 of 18th March, on the subject of interference by the Customs of Seistan the property of our mission, and to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch p F ^ addressed by me on this subject to ths Already sent to India. Majesty’s Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, a copy of which was also sent by me to the Government of India. On receipt of your despatch under reply, I directed Mr. Seymour, Third Secretary of His Majesty’s Legation, to call onMons. Nans, and draw His Ex &lt;; e ' lency’s attention to the telegram respecting the prohibiHon of the export of 3 cereals mentioned by Mens. Maurice Letter from Mens. Nans. to y| a j or Benn, and interpreted by the former as being aimed at your mission. Mons. Naus declared that this instruction, which was sent nearly three weeks before your arrival in the neighbourhood of the frontier, has no mg whatever to do with your mission, hut was intended to prevent the export o cereals on behalf of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Seistan, who had already forced the Customs to allow the passage of one caravan, m which newa interested, across the frontier. It was in anticipation of resistance y Governor’s accomplices that the order to report any forcible exportation o provisions in defiance of regulations had been given. At Mr. Seymour’s request, Mons. Nans embodied the above explanations in an official letter, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy herewi . I have no doubt wdiatever of the sincerity of Mons. Naus’s regret that Mons. Maurice should have so misinterpreted his instructions. Whatever y have been the relations between Mons. Maurice, or Mons. Molitor an J Benn, Mons. Naus himself has always evinced a desire to maintain t e cordial relations with His Majesty’s Legation, and even if this were not tne case, he is farseeing enough to realise the placing of petty obstacles wav of a British Diplomatic Mission must not only he futile, but mus ' tually recoil on his own Department. The annoyance which he displayedi * JF T *■ .He ^ Kit ?j| |1| , ili catotlef® 25 he 'brought me the telegram reporting Mons. Maurice’s action (it was the first news I had of it) was, however, obviously genuine, and he lost no time in sending telegraphic orders to Seistan to release the stores intended for your mission at once. In my own opinion the blame for the delaysj and other vexatious incidents attendant upon your reception in Persian territory, was due to the neglect of the Persian Foreign Office to make, notwithstanding my repeated warnings to it, the necessary preparations, and to give sufficiently clear and definite orders ^beforehand both to Mons. Nans and to its own officials in Seistan. This negligence was, I think, rather from procrastination than from ill-will on the part of the Persian. Ministers, and was, I have little doubt, the result of a hope that your arbitration, which they viewed with alarm as likely to cause diffi culties with Russia, and which Mons. Ylassoif had persuaded them would deprive them of territory, would by some means or other be put off. The consequence was that, when this hope was unfulfilled and you actually arrived on the frontier, it took some little time for the instructions, which they then despatched, to reach their local officials, whilst the latter, intimidated by Mons. Miller, had no clear idea as to how the Central Government desired you to be received. I am sending a copy of this despatch to you to the Government of India. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, A. Haudinge. Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C J.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, Seistan. Teheran, le 3 Mai, 1903. M. le Ministre, Comme suite a la conversation que je viens d’avoir avec votre Secretaire M. Seymour, je tiens a confirmer a Y. E. que la defense de permettre des exportations de cereales envoyee par moi a la douane de Sistan, le 20 Janvier dernier, ne visait en aucune facon la mission du Colonel MacMahon lequel a cette epoque devait d’ailleurs se trouver encore bien loin du Sistan. J’avais re 9 u un rapport du Sistan me signalant que le Gouverneur, d’accord avec le nomme Pourdill Khan, pratiquaient la fraude des cereales a la sortie et qu’une caravane avait franchi la frontiere nonobstant Popposition de la douane. C’est alors que j’ai telegraphic a M. Molitor a Meched Pordre suivant: “Donnez ordre formal douane Sistan s’opposer absolument a toute exportation c6reales, sauf quantites autorisees pour Robat. Si exportation ait lieu par force nonobstant defense faire dresser proces- verbaux de contrevention et me cabler immediatement ”. Je le repete, ceci visait le traffic illegal auquel se livraient le Gouverneur et Pourdill Khan mais nullment la mission du Colonel MacMahon. Y. E. voudra d’ailleurs bien se souvenir que mon intervention relative- ment aux ordres a donner concernant la mission a toujours eu pour but de faciliter les affaires. Je vous prie M. le Ministre, &amp;c., J. Naus. Sir A. Hardinge. iEnclosure No. 47. Extract from Seistan Mission Diary for the period ending the 16th June 1903, .******** 16th June 1903, Camp Kohak.— ******** Mr. Dobbs came out to-day to visit the Mission. He reports that the Karguzar warned the Hashmat-ul-Mnlk that, if he acted on my recent order regarding a provisional boundary line, he uould be admitting my right to t arbitrate on matters other than water disputes, and would incur the displeasure of Tehran. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk is in^ a dilemma: but has promised Mr. Dobbs to give orders that no more fighting is to take place. Mr. Dobbs says the Karguzar informed him that, in reply to their recent reference to Tehran, the Persian Commissioners had been informed that arbitration is to deal only with water disputes, and not with boundary matters.I « I rs V 1903.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. The following telegram has been sent to-day to the Foreign Office:— Begins. Seistan arbitration. The Grand Vizier has shown me a confidential memorandum by the Russian Minister suggesting a reply to my refusal of Russian intervention. In it Persia is told to say that not having a scientific expert of her own, she has applied to Russia for assistance on Commission of a Russian Surveyor and Cartographer and is not precluded by treaty from employing his services, more especially as Russia as well as Great Britain is interested in the integrity of Persia. I said that if the Persian Government chose to embody these requests in a note, I would answer it, and Grand Vizier agreed with me that the answer might well close the discussion, and that the Persian Government would have done all that Russia could ask without giving the latter cause for complaint. Grand Vizier says that the Russian Government is evidently indisposed to support the Russian Minister’s proposal that the Consul in Seistan, backed by a large military escort from Russia, should assert Russian claims on the spot. I propose answering that the fresh considerations advanced do not justify so unprecedented an innovation in procedure established by treaty or outweigh the objections we continued to entertain to it; and that I trust that the Persian Government will not now further discuss it. The Grand Vizier professed his readiness to send the Persian Commissioner to the frontier on the 10th February 1903, and to accept the rendezvous in Afghan territory. Information as to the spot selected should be telegraphed to me. Ends. ^ &amp; n • 2- Telegram, dated the 20th January 1903. From—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To— Major A. H.

From—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To—The Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, Sibi. Your telegram 1C., January 30th. What is date of Bonn’s report?Translation of a letter from His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan and its Dependencies!, to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, dated the 20th Shawal 1320 H., corresponding to the 20th January 1903. After compliments .—I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I have received Your Excellency’s friendly letter, dated the 1st January 1903, and have understood the contents, which were to the following effect:— (His Highness quotes the whole letter.) I have understood what Your Excellency has written, viz., that Major McMahon and the six officers who accompany him, together with two companies of infantry and one troop of cavalry with some followers and camelmen, will start from Quetta on the 10th January 1903, corresponding to the 10th Shawal 1320 H., and proceed to Seistan and Chakansur, reaching Khwaja Ali about the end of January and the beginning of Zikada; and Your Excellency has informed me that the above mission has taken with it the necessary provisions for their use. That, after their arrival at Khwaja Ali, their movements and stages towards Chakansur and Persian Seistan will he regulated in accordance with the advice of my officials appointed for the purpose, until they reach Bund-i-Rohak. That, when Major McMahon has completed his work, he will proceed with his escort to Persian Seistan. In your previous letter Your Excellency wrote that Khwaja Ali would he the place where the members of Your Excellency’s mission would meet the officers of the God granted Government, and I, therefore, had instructed Akhundzada Eakir Muhammad Khan, Hakim and Sarhaddar of Chakansur, who has been appointed to accompany Major McMahon in his mission to secure to the Afghan subjects their rights, to proceed to Khwaja Ali But the Afghan territory begins at Koh-i-har-ab-chah, and Your Excel lency’s mission will proceed thence to Malik Mamum, making Kala Chah their second stage, and on the third day they will reach Garmuski; they will thus travel over the three said stages within my territory, and then reach Khwaja Ali. The meeting should have taken place at Koh-i-har-ab-chah, and I regret that Your Excellency had written to me that the meeting would he at Khwaja Ali. If my officers had gone to Koh-i-har-ab-chah they would not have been able to meet the British Aiission there, as only a short time was left before the date of the intended arrival of Your Excellency’s mission at Khwaja Ali. Consequently, in accordance with my previous instructions to Akhundzada Eakir Muhammad Khan, I have ordered him to proceed to Khwaja Ali, and to meet, in a friendly manner, the members of Your Excellency’s mission. When they proceed from Khwaja Ali towards Chakansur, their stages will he as follows:—Landi-i-Palalak, Rudbar, Kladan, Chahar Burjak, Kila-i- Eath, Padha-i-Sultan, Khwabgah, and Bund-i-Kohak. They will travel over these eight stages, and having acquired the necessary information about the division of the waters of the Helmund, they will secure to both sides their riglits in accordance with justice and equity. They will then proceed, travelling over two stages, i.e., Deh Kamran and Nad-i-Ali, and reach Deh-Idu, which is situated within the limits of the God-granted Government, and here they will make enquiries about the lands which the people of Chakansur claim to he their own territory, in accordance with the maps sent by Your Excellency and the settlement of General Goldsmid about thirty years ago, and some parts of which have been occupied by the people of Seistan, who have anticipated the Afghans, and now claim the lands as belonging to themselves. Eurther, Your Excellency writes that the arrangements proposed by Your Excellency will conduce to the welfare of my subjects in Seistan, and will also increase the cordiality and strength of the friendship between the two Governments.My dear friend, in consideration of the claims of the existing friendship and union between these two Governments, I believe that Your Excellency is always willing to do everything which will conduce to the welfare and benefit of my Government. I have also sincerely communicated in a clear manner to Your Excellency everything about this dispute, which the Seistanis are making with the people of Chakansur, in my two letters, dated the 12th Rajah 1320, corresponding to the 15th October 1902, and the 8th Ramzan, corre sponding to the 9th December 1902, and I have given all the details of the frontiers between Persia and Afghanistan at the said place, in accordance with the settlement of the exalted Government of India and the maps sent by Your Excellency, and Your Excellency is well aware of the matter, and Your Excellency knows well the groundless claims of the Seistanis to places in JSaizar and to other lands belonging to the people of Chakansur, because in a letter, dated the- 24th November 1902, Your Excellency writes to the following effect, viz., “ from information in my possession I am led to believe that the Persians have for some time been in occupation of a place called Takht-i-Shah on the edge of the Naizar on the side towards Chakansur which is on the Afghan side of the frontier as determined by Colonel Goldsmid. IE this be the case, it seems desirable that the Persian Government should evacuate a place which is within Your Highness’s territory”. As the encroachment of the Persians is contrary to the said map and settlement, which was effected about thirty years ago, no doubt the mission of Your Excellency, on going to the spot, will secure to the Afghan subjects their rights according to the said map and the settlement. In regard to the waters of the Helmund, Your Excellency suggested in your letter that Major McMahon and the officers accompanying him, on their reaching the spot and after making full enquiries, would not only devise means of dividing the water but also of improving the supply of water. Your Excellency is aware that the source of the Helmund is in the district of Kabul. It thence flows through Khar Zar and Darra-Bagha and through Afghan territory all along until it reaches Bund-i-Kohak at Chakansur, from which spot alone the people of Seistan have a right to their share of the water. As to improving the supply of the said water, I myself will appoint engineers and see what can be done; and if I find the work possible, and find that the profit to myself and my people will justify the required expenditure, I shall then undertake the work; and Major McMahon, in dividing the exist ing supply of water at Bund-i-Kohak, will act according to the former arrange ment and to the terms of my two letters in which I have fully informed Your Excellency about these matters.

He informs me that he was met there by a squadron of Afghan cavalry, which Your Highness had thoughtfully ordered to receive him, and that the officers in command and the civil officers of the district had treated him with the greatest hospitality and kindness. He also tells me of the careful arrangements which Your Highness has made with regard to supplies for the Mission, some of which have had to he brought from as far as Kandahar. A subsequent telegram informs me that Your Highness’s representative met Colonel McMahon at Jehan Beg on the Helmund, on the 12th February. These proofs of Your Highness’s friendship have afforded me very great gratification, and I “hasten to thank Your Highness warmly for having so cordially responded to my wishes. . I confidently hope and believe that the relations between our officers which have commenced so happily will continue, and I am sure that nothing will be wanting on Colonel McMahon’s part to bring the duty on which he is engaged to a satisfactory conclusion. f 1 ; rTelegram, No. 274, dated Camp Gur-i-Haji, the 17th (despatched from Nushki on 24th) February 1903.

Letter from Benn, dated 15th February, received to-day, saying that Seistan officials have not yet received any information or orders regarding Mission from Persian Government, nor has anything been heard regarding appointment of a Persian Commissioner. No official is either present or likely to come to meet me at Bund-i-Seistan. Benn says Deputy Governor, Seistan, refuses to allow Mission to enter Seistan without orders, or to allow himself to send supplies. This is the more inexcus able, as Persian telegraph line now open to Neh. I am awaiting return of Maula Baksh to-morrow with later news from Nasratahad before deciding further action.

On the receipt of a report from Major Benn that the local authorities had no orders about Colonel McMahon, I telegraphed to the Legation on the 11th February, begging that, if McMahon were coming, orders might be sent to Seistan in plenty of time.

Major Benn reports that the Seistan officials still state that they have no instructions, and adhere to the terms of the Karguzar’s letter, dated the 14th January. Up to yesterday there was no official at Bund-i-Seistan; but it is reported that the Yamin and the Karguzar are coming there with troops to-day. I sent an official letter yesterday to Major Benn to communicate to the Seistan officials, stating the authority under which I have come, and saying that I expect them to give all the assistance and supplies required in the absence of definite orders not to do so, of which a copy should be shown to me. I propose moving slowly down the right bank; but the serious difficulty is that we are the guests of the Amir, and that no payments are accepted for supplies, and Persia will not allow Major Benn to send me the supplies which he has purchased for me. The Persian telegraph is now open to Neh, and the attitude of the Seistan officials is obviously dictated from Tehran. Guidance of the attitude of the local Persians appears to rest with Mons. Miller. The present situation has been cleverly worked out to demonstrate the supremacy of Bussian influence in Seistan. The attitude of Afghanistan has hitherto been extremely satisfactory.

I suggest that Colonel McMahon should offer y amin his own doctor, and, if he sends for Dr. Miller, alleging that he knows him, should inform Yamin that Miller’s presence would be objected to on political grounds, and that conferences would have to be suspended until Yamin-i-Nizam is well enough to resume them without medical assistance.

From—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. As was anticipated in your telegram, dated the 26th February 1903, we have heard from Colonel McMahon that the Yamin-i-Nizam is suffering from his eyes, and that Dr. Miller is in attendance on him. The Yamin-i-Nizam and the Karguzar have been appointed Joint Persian Commissioners. As only one Afghan representative has been nominated, it is clearly desirable that the Persian Government should conform. As the Yamin-i-Nizam is unfortunately iU, perhaps they will nominate the Karguzar alone, and the Yamin-i-Nizam and Dr, Miller could return to Nasratahad. In the meanwhile. Colonel McMahon has been instructed to follow your suggestion and to suspend proceed ings. Repeated to Colonel McMahon, Seistan, and to Secretary of State London.. 4^, __J__ Telegram, No. 278, dated Bund-i-Seistan the 22nd February (despatched from Nushki 1st March) 1903. Fr &gt;m — Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Stistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. I have received most unsatisfactory letter from Karguzar to-day ; he states he and Yamin-i-Nizam have been appointed Persian Commissioners, and have been instructed that the Seistan Commission of the Persian and English Governments have been organised for the purpose of enquiring into question of differences about the Helmand water, and for no other purpose. Letter implies their equality of status with me and ignores existence of Afghan Com missioner. Letter says entry of troops is contrary to treaty, and no permission has been granted for my escort entering Persian territory. I have replied that their instructions are insufficient to justify my recognising them as Persian Commissioners empowered conjointly with Afghanistan to deal with me as His Majesty’s Arbitrator in Helmand boundary dispute. In the meantime, I said I propose to examine river downwards, and they should assist necessary survey party. As regards my escort, I asked them to show any order prohibiting it entering Persian territory. I have reason to believe that Seistan officials received their orders from Tehran through the Russian Consul. I strongly urge that all further orders to them should he sent in Persian language by telegraph through the British Consul-General, Meshed, and Benn. Early and definite orders should be sent in similar manner regarding customs. A small customs post now placed at Bund opened Benn’s personal baggage on his crossing and re-crossing Helmand to visit me. Unless I can get supplies purchased for me and collected on Persian side of river, we shall soon he reduced to serious straits, as my reserve has been very largely depleted by unexpected demands, and I cannot obtain enough in Afghan territory owdng to local scarcity. I attach much importance to taking my whole escort into Persian territory, not only because it is evidently Persia’s intention to repeat tactics used against Goldsmid’s Mission resisting the demands, but because I can easily feed Mission in Persian territory and relieve Afghans of present heavy burden. Karguzar and his personal assistant are, respectively, nephew and son of Goldsmid’s Persian Commissioner. When once Mission gets into ISeistan with escort, Persia will doubtless expedite completion of arbitration. To meet present situation I would urge energetic action at Tehran is necessary. Addressed to Robat; repeated N ushki.Telegram, No. 535 F., dated the 3rd March 1903. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran. Colonel McMahon’s report, dated the 22nd February 1903, shows that the Persian officials had not then received orders to allow customs facilities or export of supplies. The Karguzar, on behalf of himself and the Yamin, declined to allow the escort to enter Persian Seistau, and claimed that they were appointed Commissioners with Colonel McMahon to enquire into differences about the Helmand water only, altogether ignoring the Afghan representative. Colonel McMahon believes that orders from Tehran are communicated through the Russian Consul, and suggests that the channel of communication should be the British Consul-General and Major Benn, and that orders should be telegraphed in the Persian language. He desires that permission be given for the whole escort to enter Seistan, as supplies in Afghan territory are short. It will be well to see the actual orders sent by the Persian Government regarding customs facilities and supplies. I think orders should be telegraphed in Persian direct to the local Persian officials. You have probably already pointed out that this is not a Joint Commission ; that Colonel McMahon is the sole arbitrator appointed by the King-Emperor at the request of the Persian Government; and that only one Persian representative is required to state the case for the Persian Government, both as regards the irrigation disputes and the infringement of the boundary of which they complained. The Afghan case will similarly be represented by one official, and Colonel McMahon will, after due local enquiry, pass his arbitral opinion on the case stated. I trust that you will see that explicit orders to this effect are issued by the Persian Government. As to i he entire escort entering Persian Seistan, Colonel McMahon has copies of all papers and knows we did not press for this. I would not urge this matter at present if the Persian Government allow free export of supplies and proceed correctly with arbitration. Addressed Sir A. Hardinge, Tehran; repeated to Colonel McMahon, Seistan via Dalbandin and Rohat, and to Secre tary of State, London.

So much anti-British feeling has been produced here by Miller against Mission, Consulate servants and agents have been unable buy necessaries of life.

These orders directed Karguzar and Yamin-i-Nizam toconsider themselves appointed to Persian and English Commission for enquiring into differences in matter of Helmand water, to proceed to frontier to _ await arrival of English and Afghan Commissioners, to discuss the question of differences of Helmand water, to always report on the result of discussion by telegraph and post, and carry out any orders issued to them. After finishing Helmand work, to take necessary steps regarding Mirjawa m constructing pillars in accordance with instructions reaching them by post. The telegram concludes with following words ‘.—Begins. Keep this point m view that the boundaries of Seistan and Baluchistan have been already entirely delimited. Now in Seistan this Mission is for (the) removal of differences (m respect) of Helmand water and in Mirjawa for (th-) construction of pillars and nothing else. Ends. There is no mention of arbitration and equality of English, Persian and Afghan Commissioners is implied. Persian Commis sioners evidently have no discretionary powers, which fact, in regard to Mirjawa, renders progress hopeless. In any case I deprecate being ^ placed on an equal status with Karguzar or Yamin-i-Nizam regarding the Mirjawa boundary. In letters forwarding above extract Karguzar enquires names and numbers of all my party and following, and says that taking escort into Persia when Goidsmid had none expressed distrust of the friendliness of Persian Government. He indirectly implies that, unless I recognise him and Yamm as proper authorised Commissioners, investigation of Helmand must await his reference to leliran. No satisfactory progress possible until Tehran Embassy get clear and comprehen- eive orders drafted and sent here. It is absolutely necessary for whole escort to enter into Persian territory, as later on Helmand will be impassable. Eaily orders regarding Customs and supplies also necessary.

From—.His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, To— The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. The following telegram has been sent to-day to the Foreign Oifjce and repeated to India and Meshed Your telegram of yesterday. After futile efforts during the last few days to evade giving mo a direct answer, the Grand Vizier admitted that Russian intrigue was at the bottom of the Yamin’s action, and that fear of Russia prevented them from recalling him or ordering him to dismiss Doctor Miller. I said that there was danger, if owing to the Persian Government’s attitude the present deadlock continues, that the Afghans might call on arbitrator to give the Persian Commissioners a fixed term within which to comply with his conditions, and, in the event of their refusal, to givo his award without them. He drew up a telegram to the Yamin-i-Nizam, ordering him not to take Miller with him into Afghan territory, or to introduce him as a member of tho Commission, and, when I said that this seemed hardly sufficient, he assured me that he did not like to say more, or the Yamin mPht show the message, hut that he would understand it meant that he should ^dissociate himself from Miller. I said that, in the interests of our 'ood relations, I would ask Your Lordship whether this would satisfy you I? Colonel McMahon fixed all the meetings of the Commission at a noiiit some few miles within Afghan territory, and the Commissioners all camp on the Afghan side throughout, the difficulty may perhaps he turned. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk will he associated with the Persian Commissioners in a consultative capacity, hut theh decision will have to he referred to Tehran for confirmation. It is evident that the Russians, who are just now pressing the Persian Government v^iy hard and making great difficulties about ^vnuoino- money, have persuaded it to arrange the doctor plan in the hope that we should not object, and that it now finds it difficult to withdraw.L Sr &lt;?’ .

The Persian Government have received news from the Karguzar of Seistan that we have agreed to place Afghans in possession cf Miankangi in return for telegraphic and railway concessions in Afghanistan.

The Grand Vizier is ill (not diplomatically), but I shall deliver Your Lordship’s message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day. The delay in giving proper instructions to the Seistan officials was due to unintentional negligence in the Persian Foreign Office. However, I saw a telegram, which was despatched a fortnight ago, ordering them to receive the Mission in the friendliest manner and to grant all Customs facilities. I hear rumour, which, I think, may he true, that the Russians have at length agreed to Caspian fisheries concession loan. Subserviency to Seistan has possibly been previously exacted. The Persian Government has been informed by the Russian Minister that the withdrawal of the Yamin-i-Nizam, after what has passed, would be an affront to the Russian Government, and that Miller will anyhow remain on Some compromise may, I think, still be found possible, unless you are still resolute to carry matter through with a high hand, regardless of possible com plications with Russia. In the latter case, if I find Persian Government still obstructive, shall I tell them that, unless within definite term, say 48 hours, they comply with our requirements (which should be repeated), Colonel McMahon will give award and mark out frontier without reference to Persian Commissioners.

Please refer to my telegram 26. I gave Lord Lansdowne’s message to the Foreign Minister, who will see the Grand Vizier and Shah to-day, and strongly urge that the Yamin’s illness should be made the ground for withdrawing him from the Commission. I was assured by His Excellency that orders for the friendly reception of the Mission had been sent by him about 6th February, and he expressed dis appointment and concern at proceedings of the Seistan authorities. He suggested that the head-quarters of the Mission and escort might remain on Afghan territory ; that entire escort, when moving along frontier, should not, without further authority of the Persian Government, penetrate into Persia beyond a zone, say six miles from the border line; and that, if McMahon wishes to visit Nasratabad, he should content himself with taking only twenty or thirty sowars. frontier. Telegram, No. 31, dated the 7th March 1903.10 I said I thought that all these details were capable of adjustment and settlement: that the important thing was that the Persian Government should terminate the present deadlock by appointing the Karguzar to act for it. The dominant feeling of the Persian Government is evident, anxiety that the armed force accompanying McMahon, of whose real objects they feel chiefly suspicious, should not penetrate into Persian territory for any distance.

On hearing no news of the Persian Commissioner proceeding towards the Bund-i-Seistan, I have marched slowly this place, ^ where I find that, up to to-day, the 18th February, there is no Persian Commissioner and no responsible Persian officials to meet me at the Bund-i-Seistan. 4. Khan Bahadur Maula Baksh, whom I sent to interview the Seistan officials, has returned, and reports that the above have as yet received no instructions about this Mission. 5. Pending the arrival of a Persian Commissioner, I propose, in order not to waste the short time now left before movements in the country are impeded by spring floods, to commence the inspection and survey of the country in the neighbourhood of the disputed boundary. 1 6. I expect every assistance to be given me by the responsible local Persian officials of Seistan, who, if they have received no instructions to the above effect, should immediately apply to their Government for them. I understand that the Persian telegraph line is now completed to within a short distance of Seistan. No difficulty can, therefore, arise in obtaining full instruc tions on doubtful matters from Tehran. You should, therefore, remind the local officials of the responsibility they will incur by declining to act as may be desired in any matters regarding arbitration, unless they are furnished with definite orders directing them not to take such action. In the latter case, I would request to be furnished with attested copies of such orders. 7. # While in Afghan territory His Highness the Amir has ordered the arbitration camp to be treated as guests of the Afghan Government.

Translation of a letter from the Karguzar, Seistan, to Mah® R. A. E. Benn, His Britanme Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 24, dated the 22nd Zikada 1320. After compliments .—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yo Iir despatch No. 1 (Camp), dated 22nd Zikada 1320 (20th February 1903), together with the translation of the esteemed letter No. 482, dated the 20th Zikada ( February 1903), and a copv of extracts from the Royal Commission, and t ian jZ for the same. I request you to transmit the following facts to Colone McMahon, the head of the Mission of the British Government, by way ot reply from the “Mamurs” of the Persian Government. It is necessary some of the instructions received by the Seistan “Mamurs’from the Minister for Foreign Affairs be communicated. In conformity with the orders o Maiesty the powerful, the most sanctified King of Kings, the sy Muslims, heir to the crown and throne of Kais, may our souls be nssacn , the said Ministry has appointed me and Abdul Hamid Khan, aml Nizam, officer in charge of the Seistan and Baluchistan frontiers, to ‘ 3e P . on the Seistan border to meet the English Commissioner. W e have a s0 apprised that the Seistan Commission of the Persian and English oyern has been organised for the purpose of enquiring into the q^ es ° , difference of the Helmand water and for no other purpose. Alt roug i Baksh Khan came to Seistan to interview the Government “ Mamurs , dui he had no document with him to introduce him and to explain his mission. Government “ Mamurs ” did not consider themselves under o liga ion anything, beyond showing him the customary courtesy. A^ 001 Q • t report of the frontier “ Mamurs ”, the English Mission reache . Bund to-dav, the 22nd Zikada (20th February 1903). Consequently the comingof the authorised “ Mamurs ’* of Persia to the frontier, prior to that date, was not proper. Notwithstanding all this, the Yamin-i-Nizam, the officer in charge of the frontier, came to Khwaja Ahmad two days ago, and myself early this morning, that is to say, no procrastination whatever on the part of (Persian) Government “ Mamurs ” has taken place on the present occasion. The letter of welcome sent through you this morning proves this fact. Since arrange ments have been made in Seistan for a sufficient number of cavalry and infantry to escort the respected “Mamurs” of Persia and England, and as permission has not been received either for British or Afghan troops to enter the sacred territory of Persia, you are informed that, any time after a meeting of the two parties has taken place, the inspection of the water and measurement will be possible. The entry of troops into this country, being contrary to treaties, will be impossible, unless orders are caused by you to be issued by Tehran. Other matters have been represented to the Minister for Eoreign Affairs. On the receipt of an answer you will be officially informed of it. Translation of a letter from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commis sioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, to the Karguzar of Seistan, No. 1 P. P., dated Camp Khwab Gab near Bund-i-Seistan, the 22nd February 1903. After compliments .—Your letter No. 24, dated 22nd Zikada 1320 (20th February 1903), has been received by me to-day from Major Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. It is stated therein that you and the Yamin-i-Nizam have both been appointed “Mamurs” of the Persian Government; but copies of your commissions have not yet been sent to me by you. You have stated that you have been apprised by your Eoreign Minister “ that the Seistan Commission of the Persian and English Governments has been organised for the purpose of enquiring into the question of the difference of the Helmand water, and for no other purpose ”. From this it is evident that the authority and instructions granted to you are as yet insufficient to justify my recognising you as “Mamurs” of the Persian Government, empowered, in conjunction with the “ Mamur ” of the Afghan Government, to deal with me as His Britannic Majesty’s Arbitrator in the boundary dispute between the Persian and Afghan Governments. When you have obtained full authority and instructions on this point, and also regarding the other important matters mentioned in my lette-r No. 4S2, dated the 18th February 1903, you should duly inform me. In the meantime, after making such measurements of the Helmand river and Rod-i-Seistan at this place as may be necessary, I will proceed to make necessary investigations further down the Helmand river. I expect you to give all necessary assistance to the siu-vey and other people employed in this work. As regards the British “ ashar ” mentioned in your letter, you seem to be under some misapprehension, as I have no “ ashar” with me. There will be no necessity for my Afghan escort to enter Persian territory. As regards my personal escort, I request you will kindly favour me with a copy of any orders you may have received authorising you to prevent their accompanying me in Persian territory. Telegram, No. 33, dated the 9th March 1903. ]T r om—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. The following telegram was sent to-day to the Foreign Office and to Meshed The Foreign Minister, in the absence of the Grand Vizier, who is still unwell, has shown me the telegram which was sent to the Seistan author ities. It requires them (1) to submit their case, re frontier question and w r ater,in writing to the Arbitrator, who will decide the matter in accordance with Goldsmid’s award ; (2) to afford all facilities to the Mission respecting Customs and supplies, admitting its personal effects into Persia free from all interfer- ence hut reserving the Customs right to examine; hut not, as I understand the case, to charge duty on loads intended for the escort; (3) to permit the entire escort, for purpose of delimitation, to enter Persian territory, without Customs, or other interference up to six miles inland from the frontier, but to ask the Arbitrator, if he wished to penetrate further or visit Nasratabad, to take with him, pending further arrangements, only thirty sowars. Telegram further expresses surprise at the reported discourteous reception of the Mission, and orders apology if facts are as stated. I said I thought all these details might be arranged, but that what Your Lordship asked was the withdrawal of Yamin-i-Nizam. His Excellency pleaded that he was their one technical expert in whom the Shah reposed entire confidence, and said that he had instructed Ala-es-Sultaneh, and now requested me again to urge that this point should not be pressed. He added that he was endeavouring, through Minister at St. Petersburg!!, to arrange for the withdrawal of Hr. Miller, and that instructions would be sent to Yamin which would induce him to give us fullest satisfaction, and remove our sus picions of him. The Persian authorities could not order away a Kussian Consular officer from a place in Persia within his own district. I said that I would telegraph to you the considerations he had laid before me. Would Your Lordship be disposed to vraive personal question as to Yamin, should he transfer his camp to Afghan territory, leaving Hr. Miller behind, and agree to hold no intercourse with any Russian official till his case was sent in ? It seems to me that in this way we might defeat Russians more effectually than by enabling them to boast that regular arbitration had been upset by the presence of Hr. Miller. I?* &amp;&lt;&gt; ■ • *' Telegram, No. 34, dated the 9th March 1903. xr ti;o UrUorm™, Maipstv^s Minister at Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. The Grand Vizier has sent the Yamin a telegram, stating that the latter’s ill-health must not occasion inconvenience to the Persian Government, and that he will do well to send Hoctor Miller back if he is better. The Russian Minister, whom he informed of the above action, said he had no objection. His Highness hopes that, under these circumstances, the Yamin’s partici pation in the Commission will not be further objected to by you, and that its proceedings may now begin. I venture to suggest that Hoctor Miller’s departure may be allowed to close the incident. The Shah unfortunately feels confidence in the Yamin, and our insistence on his unconditional removal will do harm and arouse His Majesty’s suspicion. This telegram has been sent to India, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General at Meshed has been furnished with a repetition. ^ 2 ^ ^ ^ Telegram, No. 625 F., dated the 11th March 1903. p r0 m—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To-—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Reference is invited to Sir A. Hardinge’s telegrams Nos. 33 and 34, dated the 9th March, to you. We are of opinion that, whoever is chosen by the Persian Government, there should only be one Persian Commissioner, and that no communication should take place between him and any of the Russian party as long as the business of the Commission is proceeding, otherwise we would still press for the withdrawal of the Yamin-i-Nizam. This telegram has been repeated to Colonel McMahon, Seistan, and to Sir A. Hardinge, Tehran.No. 503, dated Camp Khwab Gah, the 25th February 1903. From— Colonel A. H.

With reference to my diary entry of yesterday, 24th instant, and telegram letter from the Kargnzar of Seistan and the No. 27^ of tO-day, I have the honour tO Yamin-i-Nizam, No. i, dated 24th February 1903. forward a translation of the marginally noted letter. 2.

Translation of letter “ from the Commission of His Majesty the Emperor of Persia, to th« Hon'ble Mamur of the English Government^, No. 1, dated Khwaja Ahmed, near Bund-i-Seistan, the 26th Zikad 1320 H. (24)th February 1903). After compliments .—We have had the honour of receiving your esteemed letter No. 1 P.P., dated 22nd February 1903. With regard to your asking for a copy of my commission and that of the Yamin-i-Nizam, Sarhaddar of Seistan and Baluchistan, as this was not special work and lias been added to the former duty and work of myself and the Yamin-i-Nizam, which were entrusted to us according to special and permanent firmans, it has been considered sufficient to send a telegram which has been issued by order of His Majesty the Shah. Some extracts from this telegram are enclosed for your information. With regard to your communication that, as our instructions are limited to an enquiry into tiie difference of the Helmand water, they are insufficient to justify our dealing and communicating with you in the boundary dispute in conjunction with the Afghan Mamur, and that you cannot, under these circumstances, recognise us in this capacity, it is certain that, if any other matter than the question of water in Seistan and construction of pillars on the boundary of Mirjawa had been under discussion, it would have been mentioned in the telegram from the Foreign Minister, which has been issued by order of His Majesty the Shah. The boundaries of the Persian Government and Afghanistan have already been put right by special Commissioners, and no difficulties have arisen thereafter requiring fresh delimitation. If you have observed any difference in this boundary line, it is requested that you may point out that place, so that it may be explained on the spot. In the matter of beginning work connected with water, this, as has already been communicated to you, depended on the meeting of the parties; and, in case you do not recognise us as Mamurs with authority, it will be necessary for us to represent the matter to the Foreign Ministry and to wait for instructions and orders. With regard to the attribution of misapprehension in the matter of troop* accompanying you, your own justice and equity will, we believe, allow that we did not mean, by mentioning the presence of force of the army, to specify their class. Men of any tribe or nationality armed with military arms are included in it. Now that you write that they will not enter Persian territory, it is a Notb.—M y remark applied only to the Afghan different matter. WF liaV0 the honOUT troop.. only to request you to kindly oblige and a. h. McMahon. favour us with the names and capacities of your personal guards and other persons, subjects of your Government, who will enter Seistan territory, specifying their class, nationality and numbers, to enable us to carry out the obligations imposed on us by our Government, as it has been mentioned in the previous letter that the necessary escort for you has been provided and is ready.16 T the Nafb-ul-Wazareh, was on duty with General Goldsmid’s Commission.

On the other hand, there is greater tranquil- Hv now. Notwithstanding this, should you intend to enter &gt;eistan with your own special guards, it would appear as if you had no conddence in the friendly neighhouring Government. We do not trouble you any more and renew our assurances of high esteem. Seal of Musa Khan, Naib-ul- Wazareh, Naib-ul-Wazareh, Karguzar. Seal of Abdul Hamid Gbaffair, Yamin-i-Nizam, Sarbaddar.

It was arranged that a Com- mission of the Persian and English Governments should be appointed and should proceed to enquire into the difference(s) m the matter of the water of the Helmand. The British Legation have informed us that the representatives of the British and Afghan Governments will arrive on the frontier on the 1st February, or soon afterwards ; and that, as the spring is approaching, it is necessary that work should be begun as soon as possible for setthng this Hel- mand question and the Mirjawa boundary. This is the purport of the letter from the British Legation which has been telegraphed for your information. By command of His August Majesty you are directed to consider yourself, in conjunction with the Yamin-i-Nizam, appointed for this service, and to proceed to the frontier and await the arrival of the English and Afghan Mamurs Agents). With regard to the difference(s) regarding the Helmand water, you should carry on any discussion that may be necessary according to tlie iworm- ation that you possess, and always report the result of your discussions by tele graph and post, and carry out and act upon any orders that may be issued to you. After tbe work of tbe Helmand water is finished, regarding Mirjawa also you should take the necessary steps in constructing pillars in accordance with instructions which will reach you by post.

From-—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. I think, unless you attach special importance to a single Persian Commis sioner, who in this case will be the Yamin-i-Nizam, that co-operation of Karguzar and Governor will be, if anything, advantageous to our interests, and I consider that their exclusion, which their vanity may cause them to resent, may lead them to intrigue with the Russian officials.

We can see no reason why there should be more than one Persian Commis sioner for the stating and arguiiig of the case. He can, of course, consult the other Persian officials.

I hare to-day telegraphed the following to Foreign Office and repeated to Meshed :— Tour telegrams 23 and 24. I yesterday agreed with the Grand Vizier on all points except apology. His Highness contending that his officials had not been shown to have misbehaved. He had instructed his Minister at London to speak on this point to Your Lordship. I said that my information was not derived direct from Colonel McMahon but from Your Lordship, hut that you were satisfied as to facts. On his side, he complained that Colonel McMahon had treated his Commissioners somewhat arrogantly and, whilst claiming that he himself should take his escort into Persia, would not let them bring any of theirs to Miankangi, which they claimed as Persian territory. The Persian Government have instructed their officials to make an apology if the facts are as alleged, but as the Seistan officials will probably dispute facts, and as negligence to send clear instructions to them from here was not deliberate, but was part and parcel of ordinary oriental procrastination and slovenliness in dealing with a disagreeable subject (Colonel McMahon s arrival ontingency which, till the last, they hoped might be averted), I fear being a contingency we must expect a long discussion on this point. I have read to the Grand Vizier translations of both your teiegrams, and have left him in no doubt as to Your Lordship’s views. * •£ *- * Telegram, No. 291, dated Camp Nadali, the 9th (despatched from Dalbandin on 18th) March 1903. From— Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. I have just received your telegram 494. The position remains as reported in my telegram No. 279 of the 25th February and my diary for period ending the 28th February. The Persians consent to my camp crossing the river, but beg me not to bring escort until receiving orders. Topography and irrigationsurvey work, in which the Persians are assisting, are proceeding steadily in Persian territory. So far as I can judge, I think they fear giving me a pretext to cross. Since the 2nd March the river has been unfordable through flood, hut it is now falling. The river will, however, soon begin its annual rise; it is obviously undesirable to leave the escort on the Afgnan side, and I am anxious to get the whole camp, with escort, across, and to locate my main camp west of the main channel, say near Nasratabad, before the country becomes inundated. No meeting with the Persians has yet taken place owing to high river. Dr. Miller is still near the Persian camp on the opposite bank, and I understand that the Yamin-i-Nizam has orders from Tehran to consult the Russian Consul in all arbitration matters. I know definitely that copies of all my letters to the Persian Commissioner are sent to Miller by the Yamin. Latter has sent a very exaggerated report to Tehran, and his idea seems to be to afford the Russians a pretext for sending to Seistan a Russian escort to protect the interests of Persians, and, pending their arrival, to delay the arbitration proceedings. Miller has thoroughly frightened the Persians about the aggressive purpose of the Mission. I would suggest Sir Arthur Hardinge reassuring the Persian Government that we intend to respect Goldsmid’s award. The Persian Government will also perhaps ask him about Miankangi, be cause, in a recent letter to the Persian Commissioner, I said that this tract of country being disputed by both sides, must, for the purpose of preliminary inspection work, be considered debatable, and I suspect my meaning has been misrepresented to Tehran. I trust it will be found possible to insist on the transfer of the Yamin-i-Nizam; his recall to Nasratabad only will be of no advantage. The following is an epitome of a telegram from Colonel McMahon, dated Nadali, 9th March :— Begins. The position remains as reported on the 2oth Pebruary. The Persians consent to my camp crossing the river, but ask me not to bring my escort till they receive orders. Survey work is proceeding in Persian territory, and in thh the Persians are assisting. I am anxious to get the whole camp with escort across, and to locate the main camp near Nasratabad before the country becomes inundated. The river will begin its annual rise. No meeting has yet taken place with the Persians owing to the high river which is now temporarily falling. Dr. Miller is near the Persian camp, the Yamin has orders from Tehran to consult the Russian Consul in all arbitration matters, and copies of all my letters to the Persian Commissioners are being sent to Dr. Miller by the Yamin. Yamin has sent to Tehran an exaggerated report, and is working to afford a pretext to the Russians for sending a Russian escort to Seistan to protect Persian interests, and, pending their arrival, to delay arbi tration. Dr. Miller has thoroughly frightened the Persians about the aggressive purpose of the Mission, and I suggest that Sir A. Hardinge should reassure the Persian Government that we intend to respect the Goldsmid award. I said in a recent letter to the Persian Commissioner that Mian Kangi being disputed must be considered debatable, and I suspect that my meaning has been mis represented to Tehran. I trust the transfer of the Yamin will be insisted on, as his recall to Nasratabad will not suffice. Ends. As regards Mian Kangi please see Sir A. Hardinge’s telegram No. 29, dated 5th March 1903. Colonel McMahon’s telegram above summarised was despatched before the orders referred to in Sir A. Hardinge’s telegram of 9th March could have reached the Seistan authorities, but I can anticipate no improvement unless very stringent orders are issued forbidding communications between the Persian Commissioner and any of Russian party as long as work of Commission is proceeding or the Yamin is recalled.

Yamm-i-Mzam with Karguzar on Com mission with great misgiving. Benn suspects him of being in pay of Miller, and he is likely to regard his appointment to Commission as proof that Tehran authorities do not disapprove of his recent anti-British proceedings. The Karguzar is apparently well-meaning man, but weak and much under influence of Yamin-i-Nizam. If the latter, acting as Miller’s tool, can frighten or cajole him into not going to the frontier on some excuse, say illness, there will be deadlock, and British Commissioner w r ill find himself in very undignified position. There is also the danger that the Afghans may lose patience and occupy again the disputed territory. The telegraph line is now about three-quarters of the way to Seistan, and Miller is in telegraphic touch with Tehran and St. Petersburg!! through Russian Engineer; any forward movement on the part of the Afghans now might result in embarrassing action on the part of the Russians in these parts. Is there no chance of getting Hashmat-ul-Mulk re-appointed Governor of Seistan for coming year ? He has left for Seistan, and if you could induce Atabeg-i-Azam to secure Governorship for him, and to order him to take over Persian Commissionership on delimitation, if Karguzar has not started for any reason, it would probably have effect of defeating any possible intrigues of Miller’s. Otherwise, if Miller intrigues successfully, British and Afghan Commissioners may be kept waiting indefinitely on the frontier. Benn states22 that there is much distress in Seistan which despatch of more troops will aggravate. The people are miserably poor, and Benn says that Mullas, acting as agents for Miller, are spreading story among them that the British are the cause of their misfortunes. If Persian troops must go, however, I press that they may be sent from Kerman or elsewhere in the south. If more troops are sent from this neighbourhood, fact will be reported by Afghan Agent, and Afghans will also send more troops. Governor-General and Karguzar here have had no orders about Delimitation Commission. Any orders regarding Eashmat-ul-Mulk should be sent through Naiyer-ed-Dowleh in cypher.

Poreign Minister in absence of Atabeg-i- Azam says that Persian Commissioner’s orders to meet McMahon were sent direct by new telegraph line to point about 100 miles from Nasratabad and not through Meshed. He also says that, although Persian Government is not altogether pleased with Hashmat-ul-Mulk, there has not been, so far as lie is aware, any proposal for some considerable time past to remove him. I agree with you that he would be better Commissioner than Yamin-i-Nizam, and I have expressed regret at latter’s appointment. In view, however, of the line which we have taken in the matter of the proposed Russian inter ference, I am doubtful whether it would be wise to press our views regarding the co-operation of Persian Commission too strongly.

After compliments .—I write to acknowledge your letter of yesterday, the 24th February 1903 (26th Zikad 1320), with which you send extracts of a telegram No. 10, dated the 2nd February 1903, received by you from the Persian Foreign Minister. I notice among other things in the instructions conveyed to you in the above telegram, that there is no mention of arbitration. I write, therefore, to make it clearly known to you that I have been sent to this country by Bis Majesty the King of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India, at the request of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, to arbitrate in the disputes which have arisen between the Persian and Afghan Governments regarding the Seistan boundary. That disputes have arisen regarding that boundary, as well as merely questions of water difference, is a matter w r ell known to yourselves. You will understand, therefore, that, until you receive instructions which are more in accordance with what has been arranged between our respective Govern ments, I am not in a position to recognise you as “ Mamurs ” properly em powered to deal fully with the matters regarding which I am appointed as arbitrator; but, pending the receipt of further and fuller instructions by you from your Government, I am willing to recognise you as “ Mamurs ” in matters where I require assistance in the survey and inspection work, which is neces sary to he done before any discussion regarding disputes about water or other matters can profitably he commenced. I have every right to expect such assistance, and, owing to the friendship which exists between the British and Persian Governments, I have no doubt that such assistance will he given, and that you will issue all necessary orders that no interference will he permitted with either the free movements of my people employed on this work or with the provision of supplies required by my Mission. As regards what you have enquired about my escort and party, I write to say that the British Government have sent with me, as a mark of honour, a personal escort of two companies, i.e., 200 infantry and one troop, i.e., 60 cavalry. My party consists of— Captain Ramsay, Personal Assistant, Mr. Tate, Survey Officer, Mr. Ward, Irrigation Officer, Major Wanliss, Intelligence Officer, and with my escort the following officers :— Major Walters, Infantry Officer, lieutenant Landon, Cavalry Officer, Captain Irvine, Medical Officer, Captain Bell, Transport Officer. Besides there are Native Attaches, necessary establishments for survey and office work, servants and camel-men, all come from India and Baluchistan. They will necessarily accompany me wherever I go. As regards my escort entering Persian territory, you will readily admit that their doing so can no more he considered as showing want of confidence in the friendliness of the Persian Government than in that of the Afghan Govern ment, through whose territory it has accompanied me here. I am sending Khan Bahadur Maula Baksh, Native Attachd, to see you and discuss arrangements regarding our meeting and any other necessary matters.

That Goldsmid’s boundary is not to be altered is the purport of orders received by the Persian Commissioners a few days ago, and that the present dispute only concerns change in the course of the Helmand and the difference about the water. I am free to move about with whole camp within one and half farsakhs of the frontier, but elsewhere am restricted to twenty or thirty men. Note .—A Seistan farsakh is about six miles. Orders are rather ambiguously worded, but, if not intentionally misinterpreted, will suit my requirements. The Persian Commissioners gave me a State reception on my entering Persian territory on the 16th M arch and paid a formal visit yesterday. They seemed anxious to remove impression of their past behaviour. Doctor Miller has returned to his brother.

I yesterday sent the Grand Vazier a strongly worded message about the action of Mons. Maurice, saying that it was useless for .me to assure Your Lordship of the good intentions of the Persian Government if the acts of the Seistan officials systematically belied them. His Highness replied that the Seistan officials had now received such clear instructions as would preclude a recurrence of these earlier mistakes. He sent me a telegram from the Yamin reporting that Colonel McMahon’s official reception at Miankangi on the 16th instant has passed off satisfactorily, and promising in obedience to orders of the Persian Government to give the every assistance to the Mission. He again assured me that the Yamin would now cease to hold any intercourse with Russia. I will speak about Mons. Maurice to Mons. Naus. He was much annoyed at hearing what had happened. This telegram has been addressed to the Foreign Office, London, and repeated to India. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. Please refer to your telegram, dated 21st March 1903. Firstly, Colonel McMahon’s wish to locate the whole of the camp with escort near Nasratabad. The mis-statements circulated as to our intentions and size of the British escort have genuinely alarmed Persian Government. It would therefore be desirable that Colonel McMahon should only take with him into Persian territory as small an escort as would be compatible with his dignity. See my telegram of 13th January. Can arrangements be made to leave camp on the east side of the Helmand? Secondly, Yamin-i-Nizam. Sir A. Hardinge has been instructed to insist again on the complete dissociation of Yamin-i-Nizam from Dr. Miller as an essential condition to our consenting to his presence on the Commission as the Persian representative.

Translation of a letter No. 3 P. P„ dated the 2nd March 1903, from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C S.I., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Special Commissioner and Arbitrator tor Persian-Afghan Boundary dispute, to the Karguzar of Seistan and the Yamin-i-Nizam. After compliments .—I have been considering the matter of how survey and inspection work connected with this Mission should be carried out irom here onwards. \J1_I VV CLl vt.o» B i. •i- It is known to you that the Afghans last year advanced claims to l ™ ' r 7 east of, and up to, the fiod-i-Panan on the ground that the Eod-i-Parian is now the main channel of the Helmand river. &gt; The Persian Government, on the other hand, contended that the boundary laid down between Persia and Afghanistan by General Goldsmid was the old Nadali channe o^ 1 mand, and this should continue to he the boundary. Ihe aho\ _ both sides are clearly stated in the Mushir-ud-Douleh s letter / J , ii 1902, to the British Embassy, Tehran, and on this dispute His Hig i Shah’s request for the arbitration of the British Government Mas as ® * tract of country between the Rod-i-Parian and the old channe o mand must, therefore, be considered debatable country. The Atghan sioner has expressed a wish to accompany me with his camp wmie 1 . tract. 1 am doubtful of the wisdom of this, and intend to inform imundesirable for him to do so. At the same time it is equally undesirable that, if I prevent the Afghan camp coming into that country with me, yours should come. I propose therefore that, while I am obliged to be in the country between the Rod-i-Parian and hJadali’s channels of the Helmand, for purposes of survey and inspection work, the Afghan Commissioners’ camps should remain on the east bank of the Nadali channel, and that your camps should similarly remain on the west bank of the Rod-i-Parian. This measure, it is to be clearly understood, is not to prejudice or affect the respective claims of either party, but is intended to prevent the friction between the two parties which may arise if one and not the other party, or even if both, accompany me into that country. The above remarks do not apply to the actual representatives of either nation. They, the Persian and Afghan Commissioners, are welcome to accom pany me, but without troops. I feel sure tha“ you will readily admit the necessity for this arrangement. It is one on which I attach importance, and I am obliged to warn you of the serious responsibilities you will incur by disregard of my wishes in the matter. Translation of a letter No. 2, dated Deh Ghulam Khan, the 3rd March 1903, from Mirza Musa Khan, Naib-ul-Wazareh, Karguzar, and Abdul Hamid Khan, Yamin-i-Nizam, Sarhaddar, “ Mamurin ” of His Majesty the Emperor of Persia in Seistan, to the Chief of the Commission of the British Government. After compliments .—We have had the honour of receiving your esteemed letter No. 3 P.P., dated 2nd March 1903. In the matter of the measurement of water we have repeatedly said before, and we state again, that, as we have not spared ourselves in any way whatever in rendering possible assistance and help higher up, we shall not restrain our selves lower down, so far as lies in our power. With regard to last year’s claims of the Afghans, which you say they have to the land between the original Helmand and the new Rud (channel) called Paryan, our reply of course is the same as that given by the Persian Poreign Ministry to the Legation of your Government, because this Paryan branch came into existence eight years after General Goldsmid’s arbitration. Gradually, owing to numerous and different dams thrown across the original Helmand by Afghans in later times, contrary to the General’s award, the aforesaid canal has expanded and done damage to lands in the interior of Seistan. Therefore, the Miankangi land can on no account whatever form the subject of dispute and contention, and, in lands admittedly belonging to the Persian Government, Persian officials are at liberty to move about as they may consider advisable. You write to say that the Persian “ Mamur ” (Agent) has expressed a wish to accompany you with his camp while you are in that tract of land. We have looked up our previous letters, and do not find that we ever expressed such a wish. We have therefore the honour to request that you will kindly point out the place of this wish. Regarding the menace of serious responsibility falling on us, we believe your right-seeing judgment and justice will certify that, if any responsibility should fall on us for safeguarding the interests of our Government, we shall have great pride in accepting it. Translation of a letter No. 6 P.P., dated Camp Nadali, the 6th March 1903, from Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner and Arbitrator for Persian and Afghan Boundary dispute, to the Karguzar of Seistan and the Yamin-i-Nizam. After compliments .—I have received your letter No. 2, dated the 3rd March 1903. I write to thank you for your kind promise of assistance to my working parties and for the assistance already given to them.4 As regards what you have written about the Miankangi lands not being subiect to dispute, I am unable to alter what I have said in my previous letter. That letter did not question the present possession of Miankangi by your Government, but referred to claims made to that tract by the Afghans on account of change in the course of the Helmand. I understand you have moved your camp into Miankangi and have undertaken full responsibility for all that may result therefrom. It is the Afghan “ Mamur ” that is mentioned in my letter No. 3 of 2nd February 1903 as having expressed a wish to accompany this Mission into Miankangi. If the word “ Persian Mamur ” were inadvertently written in- stead of “ Afghan Mamur' ,, } please correct it. I am sending Khan Bahadur Mania Bakhsh to settle with you the arrange ments for the reception of this Mission on crossing the river. • $ 2 3 Telegram, No. 303, dated the 23rd March 1903.

McMahon, C.S I., C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Commis sioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission. I have the honour to furnish the following report on the recent detention of Mission supplies by the Customs Department. 2. On the 10th March, nine, out of twenty camel-loads of provisions, which you had asked me to buy in Nasratabad, were proceeding past my camp at Milak towards the ford on the Helmand river (close to your camp) when they were arrested by the Customs Mirza, who proceeded to examine them. I protested against his action, and pointed out that I was aware, from corre spondence received from Tehran and also from the Customs Director himself, that the rules of the Customs Department had been relaxed in favour of His Hritannic Majesty’s Commissioner. The Mirza replied that his orders referred only to the entrance into Persian territory of the Mission property; and not to its leaving the country. After obtaining from him a written statement to the effect that he had detained your camels, the camels proceeded on their way, but, on reaching the village of Milak, 300 yards distant from my camp, they were again arrested. I invited the Mirza to come to my tent to explain this action of his. He refused to come. I then went myself to the village, but was met by a band of about 70 men, of whom some 20 or 30 were armed. I asked the Mirza to give me a receipt for the camels and their loads, which he proposed keeping in the village. As he refused to do so, and also declined to take any responsibility for theft or loss of your property, I ordered my sowars to take charge of the camels and loads, and to proceed to the ford, where I considered they would be safer than in the village. The Mirza then said he would also accompany them, to which I raised no objection He took some 20 armed men with him to the ford, where the supplies we e deposited on the Persian bank of the river. The following day the remaining 11 camel-loads were similarly deposited at the ford by the Mirza, but, as I understood that your camp was somewhat urgently in need of ghi, I paid Customs duty on it, and it was then allowed to cross the river. 3. On the 12th of March, the Mirza told me he had orders to confiscate all the camels and the supplies, except those the export of which was not prohibited. I asked to see these orders, and he handed them to me. They are signed by M. Maurice, Director of Customs, and were explicit. I then went to your camp to deliver you this document in original, and to report the incident. Under your instructions, I accompanied Captain Ramsay, your Assistant, and Khan Bahadur Maula Baksh to the ford, where we interviewed the Mirza, who showed us other letters he had received from M. Maurice, which force me to conclude that, far from wishing to “afford the Mission every facility', the Customs Department (doubtless at the instigation of the Russian Consul) appear to be anxious to make difficulties, and to hamper the work ot the Mission in every way. 4.

After compliments .—I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I have received Your Excellency’s friendly letter, dated the 2nd March 1903, and have understood the contents, which were to the following effect:— (His Highness quotes the whole letter.) I have learnt that Colonel McMahon, with his party, arrived on the 19th Eehruary 1903 at Kohak Bund, in the district of Chakansur, and that my officers received them and hospitably treated them, as they had come on behalf of the Government which is a friend and ally of Afghanistan. As regards the food-supplies which my officials gave free of cost to the members of Your Excellency’s Mission, and wanted to furnish them with all the food-supplies during their sojourn in Afghan territory as guests, Your Excellency appreciates the said arrangements, but writes that, to remove suspicion from the minds of other people, it is advisable that Colonel McMahon should pay the price of the articles required for the use of the members of his party, and that my officials should accept the payment of the prices. I have, therefore, in accordance with Your Excellency’s intimation and wish, issued orders to my local officials that they should consider all the supplies given to the members of Your Excellency’s Mission, before the receipt of my said firman to them, as entertainment given by me to my guests, and should not take any money for them; and that after that date they should charge the prices for the food-supplies which they will give them according to the current rates. No doubt Colonel McMahon has also informed Your Excellency about these orders which I have issued. Eurther, all is well. 7^ s JS — Extract from Dia/y No. 5 of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, SeiHan and Kain, for period 1st to 15th March 1903. ******* 5. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk returned here with his son, Sartip Mir Mausam Khan, from Birjand on 4th March. I called on him on the 15th and at his own suggestion saw him in private. The Amir inveighed very bitterly against the Russian Consul and the Yamin-i-Nizam, who, he said, were both working for his removal and the destruction of British influence in Seistan. He welcomed the arrival of the Arbitration Commission, and assured me that every thing would be done to give Colonel McMahon and his officers the respect that was due to them. He told me he had already selected a site for their camp when they came to the city, viz., near his own garden, the Chahar Bagh. He concluded the interview by saying that he had thrown in his lot with the British in Seistan from the beginning, and that he intended to maintain these friendly relations in the future. I took the opportunity of bringing to his notice the unfriendly way we had lately been treated as regards supplies. He assured me that the matter—perhaps, he said, with an object—had not previously been brought to his notice. He regretted that it had taken place and assured me that we should suffer no inconvenience in future. oirr r Telegram, No. 317, dated Camp Khwaja Ahmad, the 9th (despatched from Dalbandin on 19th) April 1903.

McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission. Your telegram of 9th April. Have you received any statements of case from Persian and Afghan representatives ? If not, you should obtain these before announcing arbitral opinion. It might then be convenient to decide Miriawa boundary while weather is cool, and return to Seistan to see hot weather conditions of river before announcing final opinion. There is no need for extreme haste, and by staying you will probably have better opportunity of effecting lasting settlement. Addressed AIcAIahon, Seistan j repeated Foreign, Simla.1903. SIMLA.

Extract from the Diary of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain J No. 26, for period 1st to 15th December 1901. ***** 7. On the 7th December the Akhundzada of Chakansur sent me a messenger to inform me that during his recent visit to Herat it had been decided to re demarcate the Seistan-Afghan frontier, that the Afghan Boundary Commis sioner had already left Herat, and that the Persian representative was also on his way with an escort from Meshed. It was stated that the Afghan Commis sioner had with him a copy of a map of this portion of the frontier which had been supplied to him at the late Amir’s request by the Government of India. The Akhundzada wished to know if 1 would act as arbitrator. In reply I said that, in the event of any boundary delimitation taking place, I would, on receiving orders from my Government to do so, be glad to act as arbitrator. In the course of the day I received a visit from the Karguzar, Who had also received a message to the above effect from the Akhundzada. He wished to know whether I had any information on the subiect of the delimita tion of the boundary from my Government. I told him that I had received no orders or information whatever. The Karguzar remarked that the whole thing was a made-up story and only a piece of bluff on the part of the Akhund zada to frighten the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who had threatened to have the Akhundzada killed for screening the murderer of Kalanter Mir Abbas (vide paragraph 4 j of my diary No. 20). ***** Enclosure No. 2. Extract from a telegram from His Britannic Majesty's f ice-Consul for Seistan and Eain, No. DC., dated the 14th February 1902. ***** Please see paragraph 7, my diary 26. Afghan Boundary Commissioner from Herat has arrived and camped on ground claimed by Persians also. 1 hear the Seistanis have killed an Afghan and plundered cattle. ^ News now reaches me Miller has gone to Afghan border, and Kussian Engineer Officer, Korniloff, is also there. ***** Enclosure No. 3. Extract from the Diary of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Earn, No. 30, for period 1st to 28th February 1902. * 2. A deputation arrived here from the Akhundzada of Chakansur with letters for the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the Karguzar o eis an, myse , n , it is reported, for the Russian Vice-Consul. The purport o re e Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk was that certain Afghan subjects had heen plundered and ill-treated by Seistanis, that the Afghan Boundary e imi a ion , sioner had arrived from Herat with orders to demarea e \e r( 2 ie ’ ,, he was now prepared to meet the Persian representative or ,, e A1 \ ^ . of the boundary and other questions. In his letter o me . , „ merely informs me of the above facts. The deputation, w ^ i p , four men with an escort of four sowars, were the guests o ie j 1 ' , N „ , during their stav. After waiting four days for the ^- mir ® . / reply they left* Seistan. The reply was then sent after them by specia I replied to the Akhundzada thanking him for his letter. The Afghan Commissioner and his escort encamped on disputed groun close to the village of Deh Dost Muhammad.; but I am now ^ , they have moved from this place, and that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk hasarranged that nothing shall be done until the arrival of a Persian Boundary Commissioner from Meshed. Meanwhile, however, the news is confirmed that an Afghan subject has been killed by a Seistani and some Afghan flocks have been looted. Enclosure No. 4. Extract from tie Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 32, for period 13tl to 31st March 1902. ***** 7. Between the 17th and 24th March I was absent from Seistan on a short tour. I have mentioned in previous diaries the persistent reports which had reached me and the Persian officials in Seistan of the encroachments of the Afghans, who were said to be digging water channels from the Helmand to Tarakhun and thence to Kuntdar and Haozdar, which latter lie on the main roachbetween Seistan and liobat Killa. As the Persians regard these places as in Persian territory, they were somewhat alarmed at these reports. On the 21st I visited the Dasht or desert country lying to the south-east of our postal shelter at Chah Muhammad Baza, and on the 22nd I took the opportunity of riding over to Tarakhun. The whole country is a barren, waterless tract, and there are no signs of any attempt having been made to recultivate it. While at Tarakhun, 1 met Captain W T ebb Ware, who had travelled along the frontier from Kobat. 10. A deputation of ten men arrived here with letters for the Karguzar of Seistan from Hakim Eakir Muhammad, the Afghan Boundary Commissioner from Herat, who has been waiting for some weeks past in Chakansur to meet the Persian representative for the demarcation of the Afghan-Seistan boundary. The members of the deputation were the guests of the Consulate during their stay. They returned to Chakansur on the 31st. Enclosure No. 5. Extract from the Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 1, for period 1st to 15th April 1902. 3. On the 12th April I returned the Karguzar’s call and found him study ing the Treaties made between Great Britain and Persia. He seemed some what perturbed at the impatience and general behaviour of the Akhundzada of Chakansur with respect to the delimitation of the Seistan-Afghan frontier (vide paragraph 8 below). He seemed to think that the Yamin-i-Nizam, who is expected here shortly, and who, it is said, will act as Persian Boundary Com missioner, would not be competent to undertake the task of damarcating the frontier, which, the Karguzar said, would have to be re-aligned owing to the Helmand having changed its course, and this could not be done without the help of a British “ Commission ”, Meanwhile the Karguzar told me he had written a very strong protest against the Akhundzada’s recent behaviour. In the present strained condition of affairs the work of the Customs officers and employes here along the Seistan-Afghan border will not only be difficult, but will possibly be attended with some danger. 8. With reference to paragraph 10 of my last diary, a report has reached me that the Akhundzada of Chakansur, who appears to be getting impatient at the delay over the demarcation of the Seistan-Afghan boundary, has capturedand imprisoned Mir Sliere, a brother of the late Kalanter, Mir Abhas, who was murdered by an Afghan at Ishil last year. It seems that Mir Shere was col lecting grazing tax at Deh Nao, about 8 miles from Jellahabad, which is 20 miles north-east of Seistan. Deh Nao is situated, from all accounts, well on the Seistan side of the Goldsmid line, but beyond the new bed of the Helmand river which the Afghans now claim as their territory. Enclosure No. 6. Extract from the Diary of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, No. 2 } for period 16th to 30th April 1902. 1. With reference to paragraphs 3 and 8 of my last diary, a temporary arrangement seems to have been arrived at between the Akhundzada of Cha- kansur and the Karguzar of Seistan to maintain the status gwo until the arrival of a Persian Boundary Commissioner to demarcate the Seistan-Afghan frontier. The report that the brother of the late Kalanter, Mir Abbas, had been seized and imprisoned by the Afghans appears to have been much^exaggerated. It is also reported that the Afghans had partly destroyed the Seistan bund (recently repaired) at Kwaja Ahmad, and that they had built another bund further down the stream which diverted the Helmand water into a channel leadin 0, to Afghan territory. This had the effect of reducing the flow of water to Seistan and of entirely cutting off the Miankangi district from water. Sardar Purdil Khan was sent out to interview the Afghans, and the matter has been patched up temporarily. Unless the Afghan Commissioner with raws from the border, where he has been waiting for some months, we may expect to find these acts of aggression repeated. The Persian Government, from what I can gather from the Karguzar, does not seem inclined to meet the Aignan Commissioner or to settle the boundary. It would prefer to procrastinate until the Commissioner is withdrawn. Enclosure No. 7. Extract from the Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Seistan and Earn, No. 5, for period 1st to 15th June 1902.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, Seistan, 6th July. Please see Trench’s diary 6 of 25th May 1900 and my diaries thirty, thirty-two, one, five and six of 1902. Owing persistent procrastina tion of local authorities to meet Afghan Boundary Commissioner who has been waiting on border some months, Akhundzada, Chikansur, asked Seistan Deputy Governor permission visit him here, and proposed bringing armed force; also hinted, if reply unfavourable, he would move to Deh Dost Muhammad, which is disputed ground, but hitherto Persian territory. Governor replied he might come as guest with few unarmed men. Akhundzada has now moved to Deh Dost Muhammad, and much excitement, which Russian Consul’s attitude in no way tends to allay, prevails here. Molitor learning Akhundzada’s intention, went Deh Dost Muhammad with small force, told Akhundzada not cross boundary and threatened disarm him, as importation arms Persia forbidden; but Akhundzada apparently disregarded Molitor. Latter then returned here, consulted Miller, and with him and Yamin-i-Nizam visited Governor; then returned immediately to Deh Dost Muhammad. At above interview Miller ordered Governor send all local troops to border and oppose Akhundzada by force; he also demanded 30 men for protection his own Consulate, representing Seistan as now insecure. These troops have been sent, and Yamini with Tehran force and guns has also gone to frontier. Akhundzada said to have three regiments and 3 guns also. My agent from Deh Dost Muhammad reports Akhundzada is encamped about one mile south-east of Deh Dost Muhammad. If Goldsmidt’s line along old bed Helmand be taken as boundary, Akhundzada is in Persian territory, but Akhundzada claiming new bed threatened move to Jalalabad and Kasimabad near Zahidan—-see Trench’s map with diary No. 6. Molitor has consulted and acted on Miller’s wishes throughout. Miller on learning Akhundzada’s intention wrote to Governor letter, which was shown my officer, suggesting that Akhundzada’s action was result my instigation and implying present situation due to me. _ I have in no way interfered or been consulted in this affair. During visit I informed Governor that the matter should be settled with all international courtesy, and not by force of arms; and that, if no amicable settlement could be arrived' at, I alone by treaty on being appealed to by both parties, and^ on being authorised by my Government, could intervene. Governor promised matter would be settled amicably, and I hope Yamin will avoid conflict. Miller has deliberately enhanced gravity of situation to furnish further excuse for despatch of either Cossacks for self-protection, or large Tehran force to swamp Seistan and intimidate and squeeze local pro-British Governor. I would ask Persian Government be warned against Miller’s exaggerated reports, and instructions sent their representative co-operate with Afghans. Miller’s tele graphic report cannot reach Tehran before 22nd. Copy of this posted Meshed. Addressed Poreign; repeated Agent to the Governor-General, Quetta.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the passages in Major Benn’s recent diaries about the Seistan boundary. Major Benn telegraphs on the 6th July that a collision is possible between the Afghan and Persian troops, and that there is much excitement, which the Russian Consul’s attitude does not tend to allay. The Afghan Governor, tired of waiting for the Persians, recently occupied a village called Dost Muhammad which is in disputed ground. To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla.

I have induced Governor to warn Purdil and Yamin to avoid conflict.

My valued and esteemed emend, On the 30th May 1901, corresponding to the 11th Safar 1319 H., Your Hiffhness’s late father addressed me on the subject of a dispute which had arisen in regard to the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan m the direction of Seistan.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India with reference to my telegrams Nos. 159, 101 and 165, dated 6th, 7th and 9 th July, respectively, a copy of a report submitted by me to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India for Khorasan and Seistan, on the subject of recent events which have taken place on the Seistan-Afghan frontier. No. 172, dated Seistan, the 14th July 1902. From— Major R. A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, To— Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Whyte, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India for Khorasan and Seistan. In continuation of my telegrams to the Government of India, Nos. 159, 161 and 165, dated 6th, 7th and 9th July 1902, copies of which have already been sent to you, I have the honour to submit the following report on recent events which have taken place on the Seistan-Afghan frontier. 2. Colonel Chenevix-Trench’s diary, No. 6, for the period ending 25th May 1900, with its accompanying map, very clearly demonstrates the rival claims to territory put forward by the Persians and Afghans, respectively. His statement of the situation in 1900 also accurately describes the condition of affairs existing at the present moment on the frontier. 3. It will be seen that near Milak, a village a little to the north of the Seistan Bund or Bund-i-Kuhak, is the point of bifurcation of the old and new bed of the Helmund river. The Goldsmid award fixed the boundary along the old bed as far as Kurki, where the river became the Naizar or reed swamp, and from thence in a north-west direction across the Naizar (then under water) to the Siah Koh. Since those days the Helmund has taken a more westerly course, the old Naizar has become dry and has shifted to the west, and the point wheie the Helmund water now penetrates the new Naizar is some 12 miles to the west at Gola Kulah. The Afghans maintain that the old bed has become obliterated, and that, with its obliteration, the Goldsmid award becomes null and^ void. They c aim the new bed along the Rud-i-Pariun as far as the new Naizar. The Persians assert that the old bed can still be traced, and that whatever geographical changes may have taken place in the locality, the Goldsmid award must sti hold good. 4 I am not in a position to state what circumstances have given rise to the present deputation of an Afghan Boundary Commissioner for the redelimitation of the frontier, or whether the Persian Government were previously warned of the intention of the Afghan-Government to send such a Commission to the Seistan border. It would seem, however, that as a result of Colonel Trench’s visit to the frontier in March 1901 [vide Colonel Trench s diary for 15th March 1901), which was necessitated by the frequent disputes then ta ung p ace e ween Afghan and Persian subjects on the border, His Highness the Amir of Kabul asked the Indian Government for a copy of the map illustia mg General Goldsmid’s arbitral opinion. Armed with this map, an Afghan Boundary Commissioner from Herat, Muhammad Musa (or Isa) Khan, appeared with a large escort and guns on thefrontier in the end of January last. He pitched his camp near Deh Dost Muhammad on disputed territory; hut eventually withdrew to Afghan soil. 5 . A reference to the Seistan diaries will show that between February and July of this year no less than 4 deputations were sent by the Afghan Governor of Chakansur, Fakir Muhammad Khan, Akhundzada, to inform the local Governor, the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk (now absent in Birjand), of the arrival of the Boundary Commissioner from Herat, and inviting him to send the Persian representative to the frontier to discuss the redelimitation question. On the first occasion, the Seistan Governor replied somewhat tardily that, as no Persian representative had arrived yet, the matter might be postponed for a month or so. On the other occasions, the Akhundzada’s invitations were met cither with no response at all, or with only evasive answers from the local Government. Both the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Karguzar of Seistan had also left Seistan in the meanwhile. Piqued by the discourteous treatment he was receiving, and interpreting it to mean an intentional evasion of the frontier question, the Akhundzada seems to have decided to cross the disputed frontier line into Persian territory to provoke the Seistan authorities to take some notice of his repeated requests, and thus to bring matters to a head. On 22nd June, he wrote to the Deputy Governor, asking for permission to visit him at his capital, and hinted that he would bring a large escort with him. He also let it be understood that, if the reply was 'unfavourable, he proposed pitching his camp at Deh Dost Muhammad forthwith. The Deputy Governor replied that he could not allow him to enter Persian territory with an armed force; but that, if he would come with a few unarmed men, he would be welcomed as a guest. The Akhundzada thereupon crossed the frontier with all his troops and pitched camp close to Deh Dost Muhammad. This was about the 29th June. 6 . Previous to this, however, during the five months mentioned above, the Afghans had made two attempts to provoke the Persian authorities to take action. During the first week in April it was reported that the Akhundzada had arrested, near Jellalabad in Persian territory, a Persian subject who was collecting grazing-tax. This report seems to have been exaggerated, and it would appear that the Akhundzada—claiming the new Helmund bed as his boundary—merely protested against the Persians collecting taxes at Jellalabad. On 15th April, at a time when there was a great scarcity of water in the Helmund, reports reached me that the Afghans had partially destroyed the Seistan Bund at Kuhak, so as to allow of a good flow of water reaching a point lower down stream, called Chah Gul, where they had made a dam to conduct the water into Afghan territory. This dam had the effect of tempo rarily cutting off the Miankangi district from water, or at any rate of seriously reducing its supply. Sardar Purdil Khan, the Sarbandi Chief, was deputed to repair the Seistan Bund and to interview the Akhundzada. The affair is said to have been settled amicably and satisfactorily. Shortly afterwards a flood in the Helmund gave every one a plentiful supply of water. The harvest was in no way damaged by this incident. On the other hand, it is said to be the best that has been experienced for many years. 7. To return to the action of the Akhundzada. Hearing of the Afghan Governor’s intention to cross the frontier, M. Molitor, Director of Customs in Seistan, hurried out to Deh Dost Muhammad with a small force of the Famin-i- Kizam’s troops; but found the Akhundzada already there. He asked him to retire, pointing out that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persian territory was forbidden. It is said that the Akhund zada declined to discuss the question with M. Molitor, as being only a Customs official. M. Molitor then w r rote to the Governor to send out a force of cavalry to his assistance. 8 . Meanwdnle M. Miller, the Russian Consul, had written to the Deputy Governor (the letter was read by Dr. Ghulam Gelani, our Hospital Assistant, who was attending the Governor’s Secretary, who allowed him to see it) to theeffect that, as the Akhundzada was coining to Seistan to see the British Consul at the latter s instigation, he desired to be informed what steps the local Government proposed taking to prevent a foreign Governor entering Persian territory. The Deputy Governor replied that the Akhundzada’s coming to Seistan was a mere rumour, and that his entry into Persian territory would he opposed. 9. When the troops M. Molitor had asked for reached Deh Dost Muhammad, M. Molitor returned to Seistan and immediately visited M. Miller and the Yamin-i-Mzam. The following day the Yamin had an interview with M. Miller, at the conclusion of which both he and the Bussian Consul left the Bussian Consulate together and visited M. Molitor. The three then proceeded to the city to see the Deputy Governor. (M. Molitor subsequently explained to me that this joint meeting at the house of the Deputy Governor was a pure coincidence.) At this interview M. Miller is said to have explained to the Governor that, according to M. Molitor’s reports, the Akhundzada had been allowed to enter Persian territory. He requested the Governor to order out all the local troops and to resist the invader by force. It is stated that M. Miller offered the assist ance of his own Cossacks. At the same time he demanded 30 men as a guard for the Bussian Consulate, representing that Seistan was now in a state of insecurity. Orders were at once issued for 300 men from the border villages to con centrate under Sardar Purdil Khan on the frontier. Ammunition and gun powder were distributed to all the troops in the capital itself. On the conclusion of the interview, M. Molitor hurried back to Deh Dost Muhammad, where he met the Akhundzada, w 7 ho again refused to discuss the the question with him, but stated his intention of collecting revenue from the village. 10 . The same evening (4th July) the Yamin-i-Nizam left Seistan with all his troops and two guns, and camped at Siadak {vide Colonel Trench’s map), about 2J miles south of Deh Dost Muhammad. 11. Leaving Sardar Purdil Khan and his troops at Deh Dost Muhammad, M. Molitor returned to Seistan. He paid me a visit, and explained to me that he had carefully avoided discussing the frontier question with the Akhundzada in its political aspect, and had posed as a Customs officer only. He said he had sent out a Persian flag which was flying in the village of Deh Dost Muham mad. He maintained that he had done his best to avert a conflict, but added that certain hostile influences were at work which might tend to provoke disturbances on the frontier. He did not disguise the fact that he referred to M. Miller. On the 8th July, M. Molitor completed his report on the action he had taken and asked the Deputy Governor to countersign it. This the Deputy Governor refused to do. 12. During M. Molitor’s absence on the frontier, the Bussian Consul had written letters to the Deputy Governor and the Yamin-i-Kizam. He asked the former for an official explanation of his action in allowing an armed force belonging to a foreign power to enter Seistan. The Deputy Governor (as he subsequently complained to me) was much annoyed at this c{ piece of interference ”, and in a short but polite reply told the Bussian Consul that the matter only concerned the Persian Govern ment. The above was afterwards corroborated by M. Miller’s Mirza who told my Head Clerk. The second letter was addressed to the Yamin-i-Nizam in the same strain as above, and warned the Yamin to oppose the Akhundzada by force M. Miller had also been able—through Passand Khan, the Baluch in charge of his postal arrangements—to establish communication with one Atta Muham mad, Sinjerani Baluch, Katkhuda of Chahar Bujak, a man who has considerable influence with, and a personal friend of, the Akhundzada. My agent, who is also a personal friend of the Afghan Governor and is admitted to his Durbar, reported that Atta Muhammad received instructions from the Bussian Consul, and at all the meetings incited the Akhundzada to make use of his superior guns and troops against the Persians.p) That; pai fie Ahhufl , lc noff saw i uStbiaD. 1 IS' ^ ^ i iitfeian Coi Ik the present i Iwor isrejan sSaiTice-ai 4 13 Thus everything pointed to the fact M. Miller was trying to goad both sides to a conflict. It was necessary, therefore, to counteract these intrigues and to avert a disturbance. The difficulty of the situation was aggravated by the animosity existing between the local authorities and the Yamin-i-Nizam. Instead of making common cause to circumvent a mutual enemy, the two factions acted mde- pendentlv with the object of bringing some charge or excuse for report on the other. Purdil Khan refused to take orders or to consult with the Yamm-i- N issam. A further element of danger, and one which M. Miller was aware of, existed in the fact that Purdil Khan-himself an impetuous character-was in charge of a horde of undisciplined troops, who had been worked up, like the rest of Seistan, into the belief that their country was being invaded, and that nothing but an appeal to arms could save it. Under such conditions and with the two forces marshalled opposite each other—the one Sunni, the other Shiah it was possible that even the accidental discharge of a rifle might tan the popular excitement into a flame. The extreme seriousness with which the situation was regarded mav be gathered from the fact that, before their departure for the frontier, both M. Molitor and his Persian Interpreter left formal instructions for the disposal of their private property and papers in the event of their not returning alive. 14 Meanwhile I had obtained two interviews with the Deputy Governor. I impressed on him the necessity of carrying out his negotiations with the Akhundzada with all international courtesy, and urged him to warn his representatives on the border on no account to resort to force of arms. 1 reminded him of Article YI of the Treaty of 1857, and pointed out that themily foreign Power which could intervene—should the necessity arise—was Great Britain. As His Britannic Majesty’s representative here, I said I was prepared to do so if appealed to by both parties and on being authorised by ray Gov- ernment, but I expressed a hope that his own diplomatic skill would ren er such a course unnecessary. Thanking me, the Governor promised to 'wn e o the Yamin-i-Nizam and Sardar Purdil Khan on the subject. 15. Up to this time the Afghan and Persian representatives had not met, though verbal messages of a somewhat bellicose nature had passed between them. The Akhundzada also threatened to move his camp to Jellalabad on the east hank of the Rud-i-Dashak, a branch of the new bed of the Helmund. 16. At this juncture I wrote a letter to the Akhundzada, with whom, as already reported, 1 am on very friendly terms. With my letter I sent J 11 ? 1 a present of a Persian copy of the “Life of Amir Abdur Rahman’ . I expressed a hope that his negotiations with the Persian authorities wpuld be carried out with all that diplomatic courtesy which was the characteristic of his country. I charged my agent, who, though an Afghan, is a British subject and a resident of Bannu, to warn him verbally that there were certain people in Seistan who, in order to benefit themselves, would welcome a disturbance on the Afghan frontier, and who were now engaged in trying to bring about that end. While discussing the contents of my letter, a letter from the Yamin-i- Nizam arrived—the first that the Akhundzada had received from him. My agent heard its contents, wffiich were not of a courteous nature. The Yamin informed the Afghan Governor that he could not cross into Persian territory with impunity, and pointed out that the Persian Government had guns and “ Cossacks ” behind them. The Akhundzada summoned the Commandant of the troops and the Boun dary Commissioner to help him in framing a reply. My agent was also invited to attend. The two military members, it is said, recommended the despatch^ or an ultimatum calling on the Yamin to retire. After some discussion, during which my letter was again read, it was decided to send a temperate reply. Ibe Akhundzada sent me a copy of this reply, written in his own handwriting, to assure me that he had followed my advice. A copy, with translation, is attached for your information. In it, it will be seen, the Akhundzada concludes by inviting an interview, and asks the Yamin-i-Nizam to fix the rendezvous, lareply to this, the Yamin invited the Akhundzada to meet him at his camp at Siadak, bringing with him only 15 men. 17. The interview took place on the 10th July at Siadak. It was decided— (1) That as the maps in possession of the Persian and Afghan represent atives do not appear to agree, and that as no definite decision regarding the boundary can, therefore, he arrived at for the present, the matter should be referred for orders to Tehran and Kabul, respectively. (2) That pending the receipt of orders from their Governments, both parties should retire from the frontier. The Akhundzada, though he dismissed his troops, was at first inclined to remain at Deh Dost Muhammad with a small escort, there to await his orders. He is now said to have retired to his own residence at Kila-i-Kang, and the Yamin-i-Nizam and Sardar Purdil Khan have now returned with all their troops to Seistan. 18. Thus the frontier difficulty, which aggravated, there is little doubt, by the Russian Consul, at one time threatened to reach a crisis, has been—at least, for the present—amicably settled. The opportune arrival of my letter to the Akhundzada was, perhaps, merely a coincidence; but it would seem to have influenced him in no small degree to adopt a temperate course. 19. I would now venture to bring to your notice the following points :— {a) That although I was present in Seistan throughout this affair, and at the disposal of the local Government should they have needed my advice, yet both M. Molitor and the Yamin-i-Nizam appear to have sought the Russian Consul’s opinion and assistance on every occasion 'before taking action. (6) That the Russian Consul, feigning concern for the safety of his Con sulate in the event of frontier disturbances, aggravated the situ ation, and endeavoured to bring about a conflict between the Persian and Afghan representatives. (c) That with the object of lowering our prestige in the eyes of the Per sians, he represented that I had instigated the Akhundzada to enter Persian territory. (d) That the Local Government are themselves in a great measure responsible for recent events on account of their persistent refusal to treat with the Afghan Governor. As regards («), I venture to think that, if the local officials stood in need of advice—and their visits to the Russian Consul would seem to show that they did—it was at the British, and not at the Russian Consulate, that they might have sought it. Their latest action would seem ^ to suggest the tact tha°t even in Seistan, where British interests are admitted to be paramount and British trade predominant, an opinion prevails that it is to the Russian Government that Persia must look in an emergency. As regards (6), the Russian Consul’s action—if it was pot an attempt to develop a scheme with a more important or far-reaching object—was a distmet effort to embroil matters in Seistan, and thus furnish an excuse for the despatch of either Cossacks to keep order, or a further supply of Persian troops to swamp Seistan and live at the expense of a Governor who is inclined to favoui our interests As recards M beyond the fact that the Akhundzada had asked me to lend him two tents in the event of his coming to yisdt the local the different Afghan deputations which arrived here were in vambly ^guests of the British Consulate—always a source of some irritation to M MiUei J do not know what grounds the Russian Consul had for sug n D responsible for the Akhundzada’s actions. As regards (d) as the Local Government were apparently without maps or Treaties, they could not, perhaps, have adopted any other policy but ttat of procrastination. But it would seem strange that during a period of five months 1 i'they were unable to procure these documents. It appears also from confidential information o-iven me by M. Molitor that, as a result of their applications to Tehran or Meshed for the despatch of a Boundary Commissioner, an official / t he Yamin-i-Nizam) has been sent who is not authorised to undertake the duty nor is in possession of any maps or documents regarding the boundary. It is not actually known, but it is, perhaps, pardonable to assume that the map the Yamin showed to the Akhundzada was supplied to him by M. Miller. 20 I will not venture to discuss the merits of the respective claims of the Persians and Afghans on the frontier. The question is one which, unless the Afghans accept the Goldsmid award, will develop into some importance. If the Afghan contention, that the obliteration of the old Helmund bed renders the Goldsmid award null and void, be considered as admissible, then I venture to think that it will be necessary to have the disputed portion of country resurveyed, with a view to deciding whether the old bed is traceable or not. If it be dismissed, it will, I think, then be necessary to retrace the old Helmund river bed, which now offers no very distinct natural landmark, and to demarcate the Goldsmid boundary with pillars on the giound. 21. Copies of this report are under despatch to the Government of India in the Poreign Department, and to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General in^Baluchistan. 2 'Jt 3- Translation of a letter from Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad Khan, Governor of Chakansur, to Yamin-i-Nizam, Officer in charge of the Seistan frontier. After compliments.—1 am in receipt of your kind letter, and greatly rejoice to learn that you are in good health. You have written to say that I have made an encroachment on the Persian frontier, and that this is contrary to the principles of the laws of nations, and that, as excitement has been caused in Seistan, you fear lest a skirmish should take place which would be productive of annoyance between the two Muham madan Powers, and that you (Persians) are not of a cowardly spirit and have numerous excellent guns and rifles and brave soldiers. Dear Sir, leaving encroachments on Persian frontier aside, the devoted servants of the Khudadad (Afghan) Government have not even entered Persian territory yet, according to the official maps which wmre made in former times by capable servants of the two Muhammadan Governments in conjunction with the arbitrators of foreign Governments who came to Seistan. After the institu tion of enquiries, and the ascertainment of facts, the boundary line was distinctly shown in the maps. One map was given to the Persian Commis sioners, and the other was entrusted to the Afghan Commissioners. Of these maps you have one, whilst the other is in the possession of the servants of the Khudadad Government. Prom both these maps the boundary line is clear and apparent. By the grace of God, extremely friendly relations exist between the two high Islamic Powers, and enmity will never be thought of. It would be well if we interviewed each other, and if you kindly fixed a rendezvous. Telegram, No. 25, dated the 1st August 1902.

Mr. Grahame, on my instructions given m view of a probable reference by the Minister for Eoreign Affairs to the incident, said that I had received no instructions ; but that, as a personal suggestion, 1 recommended a settlement by local authorities, with Major Benn as friendly intermediary, adducing, if necessary as a precedent, the action or Colonel Trench, which has been reported in the diary, for the period 1st to 15th March 1901, of the Vice-Consul in Seistan.

With reference to the last part of paragraph 1 of my diary No. 7, the Afghan Boundary Commissioner left Persian territory at Deh Dost Muham mad, and joined the Akhundzada in Chakansur on 15th June. Everything on the Seistan-Afghan frontier has since been quiet. On the 19th Julv, the Yamin-i-Nizam left Seistan and went to Chakansur to pay the Akhundzada a visit at Kila-i-Kang in Afghan territory. The reason for this is not known, but it is said that during his previous visit to the frontier, the Yamin omitted to return the call which the Akhundzada paid him at Siadak, when, as has been reported, the boundary question was discussed, and that it was to make up for this apparent slight that the Yamin journeyed to Afghan territory. I have again been informed from a reliable source that throughout the recent frontier difficulties, the Russian Consul was in communication with the Yamin-i-Nizam and also sent messages to the Akhundzada claiming the right of intervention between the two parties if necessary. * ****** 9.

I have the honour to refer to Your Lordship’s telegram of the 18th August 1902 regarding the Helmund boundary. I deprecate mtroducing the question of assessment of damages. The settlement of territorial dispute will be suffi ciently difficult in itself. The Afghans are likely to have suffered severely by the change in the course of the river, and any damages awarded will be difficult to realise from either party. The Persian Government might be informed ^ of the facts stated in my telegram of the 19th August to Mr. Des Graz (which was repeated to you), and he asked to await the result of ^arbitration, as local enquiries can alone establish the facts and rights. There is no objection to the addition suggested about the desirability of officers being at once allowed to visit the locality. I suggest that the Persian and Afghan Governments should be asked to agree as was arranged in 1871 that, if the decision of the British arbitrator is not accepted by either side, a reference should he made to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whose final decision should he binding upon both the Government of Afghanistan and on that of Persia. - Telegram, No. 230, dated Nushki, the 25th August 1902.

Precis of telegraphic report posted to Consul-General, Meshed :— Begins. 226, Seistan, 15th August. With reference present water famine here, Miller wrote Akhundzada asking cause of it. Akhundzada replied scarcity due abnormal dryness. Miller tried persuade messenger take presents to Akhundzada, but messenger refused. Some weeks hack Purdil Khan, Sarbandi Chief, sent two camel sowars to report on condition of Helmund. They travelled from Seistan bund for 20 marches along banks, and have now returned with report that 10 to 12 bunds have been constructed at different points which divert water to irrigate lands hitherto uncultivated. Akhundzada also reported to have opened deep channel just above Seistan bund, thus drawing off to Chakansur what little water exists. Purdil Khan reported above to Deputy Governor who wrote over to Miller. Latter immediately visited Deputy Governor and with him went to Yamin-i-Nizam. Miller there drafted letter for them to Kabul, which it was decided send to Akhundzada to be forwarded.. My Agent has already gone to Akhundzada; I hope to arrange visit and discuss matter, not only to verify above reports and relieve present situation ^ which is becoming serious, but also as counter-stroke to the impressidia^ wrhich Miller creates that he alone can deal with and act as adviser to local Government in Afghan affairs. I venture to bring to notice Miller’s persistent interference in Afghan affairs and disregard of 1857 Treaty hy local Government and Yamin-i-Nizam. Am protesting to Governor, but to carry effect Tehran support necessary. You will remark that, under the guise of Persian postal arrange ments, Miller is also trying extend hostile influence in direction our Baluchistan frontier —vide my recent reports on postal matters. Akhundzada’s recent report to Kabul that Robat Thana is in Afghan territory probably due to hints from secret Russian agents. Copy of this goes to Foreign and Agent to the Governor- General, Quetta. Ends. Later. In interview with Deputy Governor I gave him copy of paragraph 3, Article 6, of 1857 Treaty. Governor pleaded joint meeting with Miller and Yamin was coincidence; corroborated report of 10 bunds having been built between Kohak and Kabul; denied having sent letter to A.khundzada; expressed regret for conduct, and promised refer to me in future if he needed advice on Afghan affairs. My agent from Akhundzada returned; Akhundzada had not received letter from Seistan Governor about water; offered to send his reply through me should he receive such a letter; asked me postpone visit, as he was on point of going on tour. Latter is probably in connection with his orders to visit Robat —vide my telegrams 212 and 214. Regarding water famine here all reports tend to prove that water in Helmund itself is scarce, but Akhundzada has repaired a bund at Kila-i-Fath, so that only enough trickles through to admit of sufficient reaching mouth of an old channel which he has recently opened not far above Band-i-Kohak or Seistan bund. This channel, said to be deeper than bed of Helmund, draws off all water to Chakansur. My agent reports he waded two days ago through rice-fields under water to reach Akhundzada’s village, that Akhundzada drinks running water, and that water for throwing on hot weather tatties was also taken from running stream, proving superfluity. Akhundzada says he has built no new bund at Kila-i-Fath, and that in normal years Helmund flows over Kila-i-Fath bund in plenty and reaches Seistan bund; this vear it is many feet below bund. This is probably time, hut does not exonerate his opening mouth of old channel above and south of4 Seistan bund and denuding Seistan of water. On the other hand, local Governor and Yamin told me Chakansur is also suffering from scarcity and many villasres deserted, hut this may be to cover their own inability to obtain water for Seistan. Last paragraph of Goldsmid’s award seems rather ambi guous. Am I right in understanding that prohibition against constructing canals refers to that portion of Helmund below and north of Seistan bund ? Persians claim that it refers to whole length from Kohak to Kabul; in any case, they say Afghans can’t cut off entire water-supply. Every channel here is dry. We are all subsisting on well water; melon crop is practically nil this year; cattle are reported dying; cotton and tobacco crop in Miankangi is reported ruined. If wa ter does not come by end of August, the commencement of sowing season there will be no spring crops. It is hinted on all sides, and my agent also gathered from general tone of Akhundzada’s conversation, there is element of retaliation in Akhundzada’s unfriendly action. Unfortunately my agent, who is a trader, has now left for Quetta, and 1 cannot yet be so well informed as formerly. Latter portion this telegram posted to Meshed. Addressed Eoreign; repeated Agent to the Governor-Geneial. regard to assessment of damages has been noted by the Eoreign Office, but they consider it impossible to prevent the question being raised, and that it will be impossible to reach a satisfactory settlement, without some recommendations by the arbitrator in relation to the method of dealing with it. In conversation with Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, the Grand Yizier dwelt strongly on the urgent necessity of Persian authorities repairing irrigation works damaged by the Afghans and on the distress caused by their actions. Les Graz has been instructed to ascertain facts. Please let me know if information on the subject has yet reached you. Please refer to Your Lordship’s telegram, dated the 27th August 1902. Major Benn telegraphs on the 17th August that the reports sent to thePersian Government (see your telegram of the 5th August) appear exaggerated and do not refer to developments since the 14th July last. The Akhundzada only camped near one village, Leh Dost Muhammad, and as far as Major Benn knows, he built no houses, though he may have erected huts as a protection against the heat. As reported in my telegram No. 32 of the 6th August, the Afghans are said to have since withdrawn. The Akhundzada threatened to collect taxes; but no report has been received of his having actually done so. With regard to the water dispute, Agents sent out by Purdil Khan who went twenty marches along the Helmund report that ten or twelve bunds have been constructed at different points, which divert the water to lands hither o uncultivated. They also report that the Akhundzada has opened^ a deep channel to Chakansur just above the Seistan bund. The Governor mtorme M. Miller of this, and the latter, who still tries to pose as the sole adviser to the local Government in Afghan affairs, drafted a letter for him o despatch to Kabul; but the letter has apparently not been sent, and e Governor has since promised to refer to Major Benn if he wants advice. Major Benn says the Helmund stream is very low, and that the want of \va er in Seistan is causing much distress and loss. But this is probably owing less Telegram, dated the 27th August 1902.

With reference to my despatch No. 109 of the 22nd instant, to the Marquess of Lansdowne, relative to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, dated the 22nd July 1902. alleged encroachment of Afghans OU the Afghan-Persian frontier, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note which I have received from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh asking for the inter vention of His Majesty’s Government in the matter. Translation of a letter from Mushir-ed-Dowleh to Mr. Des Graz, dated the 22nd July 1902. I have the honour to inform you of very important incidents, the occur rence of which has been reported to me. You are doubtless fully aware and cognisant that the frontier between Persia and Afghanistan was latterly in the year 1872 officially defined and fixed by the main branch of the river Hirmand {sic) which in effect was^ the common mutual division between these two kingdoms, and as the British Government was also fully informed and acquainted with the definition of the Perso-Afghan frontier that Staff officers of the Indian Government in the year 1897 printed a map on which it is clearly shown that from the beginning of this dam (“bund”), bund-i-Seistan, which is the river Hirmand, it separated the boundarv of this kingdom, and all the villages on the western side of the afore-mentioned river belonging to Persia are situated on Persian territory, but subsequently to that date either from a natural change of the water or from the dams by means of which the villages are irrigated, the water of the original branch of the Hirmand has entirely dried up, and now the whole of the water flows along another branch of the said river situated in Persian territoiy, and, as the Afghans under these circumstances wish to employ this watei for irriga tion in the same way as formerly in violation of right and contiaiy to their own title, lay claim that the boundary of these two kingdoms must be the line, i ro flip P'rpfiter volume of water of tlie river Hirmand flows and a n C (rt the branch which in 1897 was selected to dehne the frontier of f.Ttwn hinodoms With reference to their claim they have included within A^han territory'all the Persian territory which you will see on the enclosed marked map, and which belongs to Persia. Under tl.ese circumstances, I am sure that yon yourself will agree in considerin' that the Afghans were not, and w 1 not be justified in making this ckim Sng that all the points of the frontier of the two kingdoms were laid claim, ^eiiio isimoossible that there should be an alteration, because SSSSJSftSSK-Ct*,, and 1. 1, *m iha. »ll II. which previous to the change of the water-course, were situated on Persian territory'must of necessity now also be situated on Persian territory I am conviSd that you yourself will concur in all these points, and with reference to the above considerations, I think that the British Government m view of the Treaty of 1857 must intervene in the question of defining the boundary between. Persia and Afghanistan, and no doubt, in view of the ties ot friendship and amitv between the two Powers, she will render to Persia her legitimate rights, and In this case will decide in favour of Persia. Over and above the foregoing points the Afghans, not content with laying this claim, have further taken posses ion of all the lands belonging to Persia in regard to which I have given an exnlanation above in such manner that the Afghan anthonues have forcibly destroyed the dam of Bund-i-Seistan which is situated near Kouliak and at the noint where the dividing line between the two kingdoms commences and have cSru^ted another ne^ dam south of, Malik in such a way that he whole of the water of the river Hirmand flows m the dnection of the Alg an lands and thus all this year’s crops of numerous Persian villages have perished from drought. Further, they have constructed a second dam a little lowei than the first near the district of Dost Muhammad Khan. In this case I am sure that you will acknowledge the truth of the facts which I have just put forward above, IZ will look on this question as one of importance, and, m considera ion of the ties of friendship and harmony which for every reason exist so strongly between ^ twoPowersfthat you will're quest your Government to mt™ for the arrangement and settlement ot this question tha P ? equitablv pnt an end to, and that no damage may accrue to the undoubted rights of the Persian Government, and the boundary of the frontier as defined may he observed./f2~ aaHngi ls were 1|| ■on, lieenj ■onPeisiu tory, h4‘ tli refeisK' view of tin Telegram, No. 244;, dated Seistan, the 20th August (despatched from Nushki on the 1st September) 1902.

States Helmand is practically dry, and this is corroborated by two privates of 2Tth Baluchistan Regiment just arrived from Quetta by Helmand route. Bund at Kila-i-Fath was repaired by Kila-i-Fath Governor, not by Akhundzada as previously stated. It would appear, therefore, Chakansur is suffering as much from scarcity as Seistan.

Have visited Seistan Bund at Kuhak found Helmand and bed of Seistan canal along which I rode quite dry, thence I went to M elak opposite Madali. General report in each frontier village was that, up to Rudbar where is said to be kind of masonry dam, there is water in Helmand, but insufficient to flow as in normal years over dam. There is no doubt Chakansur is suffering from drought equally with, if not more than, Seistan. Reports regarding failure Seistan opium, cotton and tobacco crops exaggerated at Melak; report regarding intention of Akhundzada to build a post at Koh-i-Malik Siah corroborated, but he had not left Chakansur.

On the 16th July report reached me that Afghans had opened the mouth of an old channel above and to south of Seistan dam, which drew off water to Chakansur, but this icport was never confirmed, and Deputy Governor Purdil Khan and Yamin-i-Nizam subsequently stated to me that there was no truth in it. The water m Helmand was at that time beginning to get low, and the scarcity which affected Seistan was at once attributed to the Afghans. It has now become apparent to, and is admitted by, all, including local officia s while 1 have myself also seen that Helmand is dry for considerable distance south of Seistan Bund, that scarcity is due to natural causes, and that Chakansur is also suffering. It is said that there is no water from Seistan Bund to Rudbar. Fast of Rudbar there is said to be water, but insufficient to flow oyer the Rudbar Bund as happens in normal years. _ I have already^ reported that local Governor and officials consulted Russian Consul m this and other Afghan matters, and this may possibly account for the reports referred to in your telegram which have reached the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, and which appear to me to be of an exaggerated nature.

From—The Hon’ble Colonel C. E. Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G., Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In paragraph 10 of my letter No. 316 (Confidential), dated the 19th October 1901, regarding the Quetta-Seistan caravan route, I stated as follows, viz .:— “ Many caravans cut across from either Amir Chah, Amalaf or Saindak to Seistan following the direct road south of the Gaud-i-Zirreh, and when the Amir garrisons the western part of his Chageh frontier, some of these caravans will certainly be caught. I noticed the danger and trouble on this account in 1895 when the frontier was under settlement, and Sir Mortimer Durand telegraphed from Tehran at the time asking that, in the case of any concession to the Amir at other places, opportunity might be taken to acquire the triangular corner up to Koh-i-Malik Siah in exchange, and thus to prevent the Afghans getting astride the direct road up the banks of the Shela. From Amir Ohah by this direct road up the Shela, there is a saving of something like 70 miles, and con sequently there'will always be the temptation ever present in the minds of the caravan leaders to take the short cut to the south of the Gaud-i-Zirreh instead of going round by Robat-i-Malik Siah, and it is impossible for us to prevent them. Should any opportunity arise of leasing this triangular corner from the Amir, I trust it may not be lost sight of ”. 2. In paragraph 4 of your letter No. 1644 F., dated the 18th of June 1902, you replied that “ there is no doubt much to be said in favour of obtaining a lease or cession of this tract and of the lower waters of the Helmund. Any step in this direction must, however, be deferred until a favourable opportunity offers for discussion with the Amir 3 . I would beg to suggest that now that the question of the demarcation of the Seistan border between Persia and Afghanistan has come to a head, and the Persian Government has invited the intervention of the British Govern ment under the Treaty of 1857, the present time offers the favourable opportunity required for discussion of the subject with His Highness the Amir. 4 . The whole of the triangle between Koh-i-Malik Siah and the Helmund is at present a waste and is useless, so far as revenue goes, to the Amir. It has great capabilities, however, as the ancient ruins testify, and if we could only get possession of the left bank of the Helmand at Bunder-i-Kamal Khan and re-open the ancient canal from that place to Tarakun, we could bring the whole of the country about Tarakun under cultivation, and thus be no longer depend ent upon either intriguing Persian officials or hostile Belgian Customs officers for supplies for the trade route as we are at present. 5. Whether the Amir would consent to lease or cede this land to us is doubtful. There are only two baits, that I know of, which would tempt him. One is money, the other is the privilege of direct representation in London. 6 . Ao-ain as to the amount of land to be leased or ceded there are three alternatives. The first includes Shorawak and the southern bank of the Helmund from the bend in its course due west of Shorawak right down to Band-i-Seistan. The second leaves Shorawak and the Barech country to Afghanistan, and includes the whole of the Sinjerani country. The third simply includes the western portion of the Sinjerani country leaving Koh-i-Malik Dokhand to Afghanistan and including on our side the Gaud-i-Zirreh by a line drawn from the present boundary a h tie o t ie west of Koh-i-Malik Dokhand to the bend of the Helmand to the west of Rudbar. 7. It is possible that the Amir may have the strongest objections to parting with any portion of his territory, and that it may be as difficult orfm? «“K. »kol. 1»« &lt;.»- Shorawak » S.l.ba, R The next point is the question of the Seistan boundary, and how it ff nf, endives Aave not the details of the Goldsmid settlement before affects ourse . i h recollection the Afghans claim the line shown on SoidsmW-s mSand it is highly probable that they will he satisfied with nothing else. ^ ^ da t e d the 15th November 1901, I have shown how much land outside the line of the Goldsmid settlement, as depicted on the map, is at present in the possession of Persia. In paragraph 6 of my notes on the Persian-Seistan frontier forwarded with my letter No. 12, dated Seistan, the 17th March 1894, I reported that, so 7ar as l could judge, the Naisar could never he of any particular use to Afghanistan hcin- cut off from that country during floods. As a matter of factthe Naizar is 'the very life of Seistan as it is in the Naizar that all the cattle are kept for ploughing the land under cultivation in Seistan itself. 1 also noted that whatever might be said about the tract known as Warshufti (in which is situated the village of Deh Dost Muhammad, reported to have been occupied by the Afghans in Major Penn’s recent telegrams), the Naizar at any rate was undoubtedly assigned by Goldsmid to Afghanistan, and we could hardly object, if the Amir occupied it. 10. I further stated in the same paragraph that “the only line upon which I would venture to indicate the acceptance of any proposal for a settle ment, if the dispute is ever raised again, is the offer by Persia of the^cession of land somewhere else to Afghanistan in exchange for the Naizar , and I added that “ till the Persians make some offer of this kind, it does not seem to me that any permanent settlement that will satisfy both sides can well be arrived at’*. . . , . , v 11. The land that could best he offered by Persia m exchange is the triangle described in paragraph 5 of my notes above ^ mentioned running rom Warmal, the last inhabited village of Persian Seistan, southwards to Koh-i- Malik Siah. This triangle, with the Palang Koh hills on the west as its base and Band-i-Seistan as its apex, embraces the ruins of the old towns of Hauzdar and Kundar, &amp;c., which were formerly irrigated from the Tarakun Canal and Bunder-i-Kamal Khan and which belong to a separate water system from the rest of Seistan and ought never to have been awarded to Persia at all. Persian Seistan is watered by the canals taken off at Band-i-Seistan which t ls 011 ** lower level, and cannot irrigate the land to the south of Warmal on which Hauzdar and Kundar, &amp;c., are situated (vide my camp diary for 13th February In Persian hands, therefore, these latter places can never he cultivated. In our hands were we in possession of Bunder-i-Kamal Khan, they would develop into a British Seistan just as rich as Persian Seistan, the possession of winch would give us a locus standi that no Bussian intrigues could shake. 12. The only point is though that we cannot enter into negotiations with Persia for rectification of their frontier by the exchange of the triangle con taining the Naizar and Warshufti on the north of Seistan for the uninhabited triangle containing Hauzdar and Kundar on the south till our negotiations with the Amir are so far advanced that we can know for certain that, it the exchange is effected, we shall he able to get possession of the southern triangle for ourselves. To effect the exchange and to leave Hauzdar and Kundar and other places that have now become stages on the Quetta-Seistan trade route in Afghan possession would practically mean the^ closing of the trade route altogether. The Amir would interpose his prohibitive dues^ in the centre of the route, and once having realised the value of his new possession, he would be all the more averse to part with them. 13. The value of this southern triangle to us is far more than that of merely so much cultivable land, great as that is. Were we to get possession up1 to the Palang Koh, we should cut the line of the projected Russian railway from Sarakhs to Charbar for one thing, and what a blow to Russian ambition and Russian intrigue that would be can well be understood. All the fuss lately made by the Russian Ambassador in London over Mirjawa and Duzdap presumably was due entirely to Russian interest in this projected railway, and the rectification of the frontier I propose would thus cut the ground from under Russia’s feet and put a stop to the present Russian intrigue along our Baluchistan, frontier; not to mention the enormous increase it would give to our power in Eastern Persia. 14. What would appear necessary, therefore, would be first of all to come to a private understanding with the Amir for the transfer to us of the lower waters of the Helmund, together with His Highness’s rights under the Goldsmid settlement over the Naizar, and the land now claimed by him in the Warshufti tract of Seistan to the west of the old bed of the Helmund locally known as the “ Sim ” which has hitherto formed the boundary. 15. If we can get this well and good, but failing this the arbitration will have to take its course. In that case in our own interests we should be wrong in suggesting the exchange of territory proposed by me in paragraph 11 above, and without some such exchange it is difficult to see how arbitration can result in anything but the alienation of the good-will of one, if not both, of the Powers concerned, leaving the Russian Consul in Seistan free to make full capital of the differences brought about.37 Enclosure No. 50.

In connection with the Seistan question, I am suggesting that the Mission should march via Nushki and Chagai to Kila-i-Nau on the Helmand and thence to Seistan, and I asked the Amir to agree as in 1871 that the award, if not accepted, should be leferred to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs. Please see my tele gram of the 22nd August' With reference to your telegram of the 5th August, I propose to appoint Major A. H.

He will be accompanied by a Survey and Intelligence Officer and by an Irrigation Engineer to advise on technical points connected with the change in course of the Helmand river and^the irrigation channels. The escort might conveniently consist of two companies of infantry and a troop of cavalry, and, if the Amir agrees, the Mission should start m November. Whatever His Highness the Amir’s reply may be on the larger question, I cannot, at this late date, make arrangements to meet him m October at Peshawar. 1927 f. d„39 Enclosure No. 52.

Whtte, His Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul- General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan and Seistan, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. On the 11th August 1902 I telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, warning him that the Persians were about to send reinforce ments to Seistan, and that their despatch would be likely to create fresh complications, and might lead to the re-occupation of disputed territory by the Afghans. Since then there has been an exchange of telegrams between us. The Charge d’Affaires telegraphed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of War assured him that the troops were going to relieve troops which had been recalled. This was denied here. I telegraphed to him on the 19th September that the troops had left for Seistan, and that from careful enquiries made here it seemed to be clear that their arrival in Seistan would mean an increase of 400 to the Seistan force, I asked also whether the Minister would say what troops were being relieved. I had no answer to this telegram, but the Afghan Agent here has written to me to complain of the despatch of these troops and of a regiment which, he says, has been sent to Seistan from Kerman. He has also sent me a message that he wrote on Saturday last, advising the Amir and the Herat authorities to send 1,000 more Afghan troops to Chakansur. There is still time to stop the Persian troops at Birjand. They left here on the 18th September. There is every fear that the Herat authorities may move troops to Chakansur at once, unless I can give the Afghan Agent or the Herat authorities assurances that the Persian reinforce ments will not be allowed to reach Seistan. 1927 P. D.Kharita, No. 44 P. 0., dated Simla, the 3rd October 1902. From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, His Highness Amir Sir Habibulla Khan, G.C.M.G., of Afghanistan. M¥ VALUED AND ESTEEMED EMEND, I desire to remind Your Highness that on 31st July last, two months ago, I wrote to Your Highness about the urgent importance of the despatch of a British officer to arbitrate in the matter of the disputes that have arisen between the Persians and Afghans as to the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan, which was fixed by General Goldsmid thirty years ago. The Persian Government, in accordance with Treaty stipulations, have called upon the British Government to settle the dispute, and the case is also one which Your Highness’s Government is bound by agreement to refer to the British Government. The matter is one of great urgency, if quarrels and conflicts between the Persians and Afghans are to be avoided. I may add that the Bussian Government have addressed the Government in England on the subject, and the British officer whom I propose to appoint as arbitrator ought to proceed to Seistan in a few weeks as soon as the cold weather begins, if, as is very desirable, the arbitration is to be completed without any undue delay. I, therefore, asked Your Highness for a very early reply, and I am much surprised that you should have allowed so long a*period to elapse without sending me an answer. Apart from the discourtesy to myself which the delay implies, I must point out to Your Highness that, where disputes with Foreign Governments are concerned, the interests of Afghanistan, which I earnestly desire to protect, are likely to be seriously injured and compromised by neglect to deal promptly with the opportunities offered for their settlement. I desire, therefore, to urge upon Your Highness the need for your speedy consent to the deputation of a British officer to Seistan. I would suggest that this officer, accompanied by a small military escort, should travel by the same route as that taken, with the consent of Your Highness’s father, by the Boundary Commission in 1884, viz.) from Nushki via Chageh to Khwaja Ali or Kila Nao on the Helmand and thence down the river to the Bund-i-Seistan and Chakansur. I would also suggest, for Your Highness’s consideration, that the same arrangement should be made as was agreed to in the case of General Goldsmid’s arbitration in 1871, viz.) that the decision of the officer appointed as arbitrator should be referred to the Persian and Afghan Governments, and that if either Government objects to the award, it should be forwarded to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in England, whose decision should be final and binding on both parties. I have suggested that the Persian Government should be asked to agree to this arrangement, and I ask Your Highness to agree to it also. I desire to take this opportunity to remind Your Highness that I have also received no replies to the two important letters that I addressed to Your High ness on 6th and 17th June last, although more than three months have elapsed since they were written. The first of these letters related to my invitation to Your Highness to meet me at Peshawar this autumn, and the second dealt with the important question of the importation of arms into Afghanistan. I feel much surprise that Your Highness should have neglected for so long to reply to these letters, for they are concerned with matters of the highest interest to your country and its future welfare, and such prolonged delay is capable of un favourable interpretation. It will, I regret to say, no longer be possible for me to meet Your Highness in October as I originally proposed, since I leave Simla in a few weeks on a tour in Bajputana and Central India. But I am still anxious, in the interests of yourself and of Afghanistan, that we should have an opportunity before long of meeting each other, and of discussing in a friendly spirit the future relations between Your Government and the Government of India.

His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in a telegram, dated the 1st Octo ber, reports that Persian troops left Meshed for Seistan on the 18th September, and that the Afghan Agent has complained of this and of the alleged despatch of a regiment from Kerman to Seistan. The Agent informed Colonel Whyte that he had written on the 27th September to His Highness the Amir and the Herat authorities, advising the despatch of 1,000 more Afghan troops to Chakansur. His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, told Colonel Whyte that the troops from Meshed were going in relief, but has not advised what troops are being relieved. Colonel Whyte says there is still time to stop the Persian troops at Birjand ; and that, unless he can assure the Afghan Agent or the Herat authorities that the Persian re-inforcements will not reach Seistan, the Herat authorities may move troops to Chakansur at once. It seems very desirable that, pending arbitration, the Persian Government should be moved not to complicate the situation by increasing their force in Seistan. Major Benn in a telegram, dated Camp Khwaja Ahmad, the 23rd September, reports that the Helmand water reached Seistan Bund and passed his camp in good volume on the 22nd. The autumn sowings should now commence and the spring harvest be assured. He marched from the Seistan Bund along Helmand to Mian Kangi district.

With reference to Seistan Confidential Diary No. 11 for period 1st to 15th September 1902 (paragraph 7), I have the honour to submit the following report regarding the condition of the Helmund river from the Band-i-Kamal Khan to the Band-i-Seistan at Kohak. 2. A rough map of the river between these two points is also attached. Both the report and the map have been compiled from native information brought to me by a reliable agent whom I w ^--^th for thi* purpose.^ At point “ A ” on the map—about 8 miles north of the Band-i-Kamal Khan-is the mam irrigation channel of Kila-i-Fath (called Naobar-i-Kila-i- p. th N T he dam at point A is generally constructed so as to extend only half way across the river bed, thus allowing the main stream to continue its course northwards. In normal years the Naobar-.-Kila-i-Fath being lower than the bed of the main stream, the water finds its way naturally to the town of Kila-i- Fath Just at present this channel is dry, its bed having become higher than that of the main stream on account of an accumulation of sand which has been blown into it. ., „ _ J , . , , The main stream of the Helmund is said of late years to have changed its course and taken a sweep to the west, leaving the city of Kila-i-Fath, once on its banks, some 8 miles to the east. At the present moment Kila-i-Fath is said to be entirely cut off from the Helmund water, and my informant reports that he, like the rest of the inhabitants, drank well water during his recent visit. ' _ : Jf 4 . At point B a new water channel, the Jao-i-Nao, has recently been constructed by the new Governor of Kila-i-Fath, Aynb Khan. The old channel which branched off from this point having become filled with sand from disuse the new Governor is said to have re-aligned it and had the present channel du°\ At this point B also there are the remains of an old dam which the new Governor now intends repairing and making permanent. Materials for the dam—stakes, brambles and stones—were being collected at this spot when my agent passed. Only the orders of the Governor, who was absent in Chakansur on business, were awaited to commence the work. Only a small quantity of water is now said to reach Deh Nao, a new village also built by the Governor of Kila-i-Fath. 5 . From point B my informant travelled along the hanks and bed of the Helmund as far as the Seistan Bund. As far as point C on the map he found water about 3 feet deep. At point C the TJmr Shah channel branches off to Deh Khaogah. This channel has recently been deepened, and the water is said to run freely to Deh Khaogah, two miles from the river. There is no dam at point C ; but just beyond this point a natural barrier of sand has formed in the river bed which extends lor a considerable distance to the north, and successfully obstructs the passage ot the water beyond that point. No serious effort appears to have been made to clear away this barrier, although it is said that the Afghans have more than once invited the Seistan Government to send labourers to help their own men in this work. It is alleged that Sardar Purdil Khan and his son-in-law, the Deputy Gov ernor, knowing that the advent of the water would be the signal for local prices to fall, are anxious to dispose of the large quantities of grain which they have collected at the high rates of purchase now prevailing before they will permit the water to reach Seistan. When I asked the Deputy Governor and Sardar Purdil Khan if the barrier of sand at point C could not be removed by manual labour, they replied that the task was a super-human one. 6 . At point D is an old water channel about 130 yards above the Seistan Bund, which, when there is water in the Helmund, irrigates the Afghan lands to the east. It has not been deepened or worked on during the present drought. This is the channel referred to in my telegram No. 260, dated 30th August 1902, which it was alleged has been used by the Afghans to convey water to Chakansur. 7. At point E is the Band-i-Seistan, recently repaired and now ready to receive the Helmund water when it comes. A small party of Seistani troops are stationed at the Bund, as the local Government fear that the Afghans may try to burn it, the material of which it is made being only brushwood at present in a very dry condition.al % ^5 M naDtiepf! !in?coIw ; The Rud-i-Seistan is said to have been cleared of sand and other ohstaoles t^Seistan Biid^* ^ ^ C ° Uld reaCh the cit y ina few hours after reaching 8 . Prom the above account we may conclude (1) That water exists in the Helmund only as far Shah (point C on the map). (2) That the statement made to me by the Russian paragraph 7 of my diary No. 11, to the effect that the dam at Kila-i-Fath by the Afghans was the direct cause is not borne out by the latest information on the subject, questioned on this point, repeatedly denied the existence Fath. as the Naobar-i-Umr Consul and reported in construction of a new of the present drought. My informant, when of any dam at Kila-i- (3) That the present scarcity is due to natural causes: firstly, to the drying up of the Helmund, and then to the formation during this period of dryness of a natural barrier of sand which now, on the rising of the Helmund, blocks the passage of the water to the Seistan Bund. Against the Afghans it can, perhaps, only be said that, by deepening certain water channels on the east bank of the Helmund, they caused a premature cessation of the water-supply of Seistan which in any case would appear to have been inevitable.59 Telegram, No. 36, dated the 6th October 1902.

Prom a mass of conflicting reports which have reached Seistan, as the result of a personal visit to the Helmand and from the information gathered in the frontier villages during my tour, I have arrived at the following conclusions regarding the present situation (1) that the present drought is undoubtedly due to the abnormal dry ness of the past year and to natural causes; (2) that Cbakansur, which was said by the Seistanis to have a liberal supply of water, is suffering from the drought equally with, if not more than Seistan; (3) that no channel appears to have been dug by the Afghans “ close to and above the Seistan bund so as to denude Seistan of water ; (4) that a very small quantity of water exists in the Helmands atKila-i- Bath ; (5) (6) that there are about 3 feet of water in the Helmand as far as ftudbar, where there is said to be a kind of masonry dam. In normal years the water flows over this dam and continues its course to the Seistan bund ; that the reports regarding the crops in Seistan having been ruined are exaggerated. The tobacco crop has certainly suffered seri ously, and the opium, cotton and melon crops are damaged.S7 67 No. 438, dated Quetta, the 24th September 1902 (Confidential). From—The Hon'ble Colonel C.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please see my report No. 298 of the 30th September regarding Shahgul bund. Latter is known locally as Pariun bund also. Karguzar and Yamin-i- Nizam visited Shahgul bund on the 3rd. Exaggerated reports which may have been sent to Tehran of their visit reached here. It was said detachment of Afghan troops threatened fire on them, and Sardar Purdil Khan was being sent out to destroy bund by force. Karguzar has just returned, and I have seen him. He denies 'the reports current here; states he visited boundary from Shahgul bund via old Helmard bed to Takht-i-Shah; no Afghan troops were at bund which, however, prevented any water from entering Parez Pariun. Yamin wrote Akhundzada, Chakansur, asking him allow water pass Shahgul bund; Akhundzada wrote flat refusal in reply. Please see my report 284 of 20th September and map. Karguzar confirms report that Afghans intend opening at point on Helmand above Seistan bund which appears to correspond to point B on my map and new canal at which they have been working for considerable time; this canal said to extend^ through Khushgah village to Jaroki which is about east of Milak. If it is utilised by Afghans, while Helmand is in its present low state, it is likely to seriously interfere with main water-supply of Seistan which reaches city and district to the south by the Rud-i-Seistan. Karguzar regards situation as serious, and keenly resents unfriendly action of Akhundzada which deprives Miankangi, most prosperous portion of Seistan, of water, and which will cause failure of all spring crops; says Seistanis in retaliation propose opening an old canal from old Helmand bed near Milak which will draw off to Persian side water now entering old Helmand bed bv Afghan channel at Shahgul. He anticipates this will create grave disturbances, but has promised to try and prevent such action Says !o intention as far as he knows sending Purdil Khan to destroy Shahgul bund- proposes discussing with Governor and Yamm advisability of asking me to’interview Akhundzada with view to coming to some temporary arrange ment regarding water-supply pending arrival of British arbitrator whom he is aware his Government has asked to be sent here.

From-MAJOR R. A E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty^ Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter No * 234, dated 20th September 1902, and my telegram No. 289, dated 23rd Sep e . j regarding the Seistan water-supply, 1 have the honour to submi o A rough map to illustrate a short tour which I have just completed is also attached herewith. . , , 2. The Helmand water, having broken through the bamer san point C mentioned in paragraph 5 of my report No. 284 of 20 p reached the Seistan bund on 22nd September, and by the morning o “ had arrived at Nasratabad. The drought, therefore, is at an en ’ water has reached here in time to save the spring crops which can no US Ui lu CCBHMP 69 3. I left Nasratabad on 23rd September with the object of ascertaining as far as possible the facts as to the alleged interference of the Afghans with the water-supply of Seistan. On the 24th I visited the Bund-i-Seistan at Kohak. I found a detach ment of Sardar Purdil Khan’s men guarding the dam. The water in the Helmand to the south of the bund appeared to be low, but there was a good flow of water in the narrower Seistan channel. The force of the main stream had, as usually happens, penetrated through the bund, and the water was travelling slowly northwards in its main bed towards Deh Shahgul, which it had reached the same evening. Between the Seistan bund and Shahgul the river bed was full of innumerable crescent-shaped sand hills, which greatly impeded the passage of the water. A party of Seistanis and Afghans were working together endeavouring to clear a passage for the stream through these sand hills. On my way to camp at Shahgul I saw the “ Commandant ” of the Akhundzada of Chakansur’s troops with a small escort on the opposite bank of the river. He sent a messenger across to enquire who we were, and I learnt that he was engaged in making an inspection of the river bed as far as the Seistan bund. 4. At point B on the attached map is the bund of Shahgul. The construction of this bund and the use made of it by the Afghans during the recent water difficulty appear to be the main cause of grievance among the Persians. Prom a personal visit to the locality and from enquiries made on the spot, I am now able to submit the following information The present configuration of the Helmand bed between points B and C on the attached map is peculiar, and I have ventured to approximately alter the map submitted by Colonel Chenevix-Trench with his diary No. 6, dated 25th May 1900. It would appear from Colonel Trench’s report and map that a certain amount of water usually finds its way naturally (*.^., by the river bed) into the old bed of the Helmand as far as Burj-i-As. This is not as I found it. The water is carried into the old bed artificially by means of a channel (marked X Y on the map) dug by the Afghans just above the Shahgul bund, which also has been constructed by them. This channel, X Y, it will be seen, cuts off a bend of the river between the village of Shahgul and the junction of the new and old bed of the Helmand at point C on the map. The effect of this Shahgul bund and channel has been to divert a large amount of water from the main stream into the old bed of the Uelmand, not only uow, on the advent of the water, but in former years also. Water is said to exist in the old bed as far as point 1) on the northern edge of the map. 1 myself saw water m the bed of the river north-west of Deh Dost Muhammad in July 1901. When I passed the Shahgul bund a few days ago on my way to Milak the main bed of the river (the Pariun) was dry, and no water had reached it on the 28th September when I again crossed it on my homeward journey. On the other hand, on the 25th September, an ample supply of water had reached the old Helmand bed as far as Deh Taos. This was entirely due to the Shahgul bund and the channel at X Y. When the Helmand is at its normal level, the Shahgul bund,, it is said, cannot resist the force of water for more than a few hours; but even when partially destroyed it constitutes an obstacle ^sufficiently strong to divert enough water into the old Helmand bed to satisfy the Afghan cultivators on itis eastern l3ank* The information I received as to the actual date on which the Shahgul bund was constructed is very conflicting. It would seem that up to 4 or 5 years ago a bund (called the Pariun bund) existed at point C ]ust below the present junction of the old and new Helmand beds. This bund is said to have been built jointly by the Seistanis and Afghans the labourers from the Persian side being supplied by the village of Siadak. It diverted a certain amount of water to the east into the natural bed of the old Helmand.70 ,«»»*-■ KRsr.a t kswjs « L p&gt;™ bund, .»J Wit »«th.t bigbec up ,l,«m »t Shalgul, where also they dug the channel X. Y. It would seem, therefore, that the Shahgul bund has existed for 4 or o years, and is not of recent date. Although the Afghans may have suffered some loss by the change of the the Helmand the Shah Gul bund and channel would appear to com- C ° U Tie them “n a ver’y great measure for that loss; for the existence of this artificial^means of diverting the main stream practically counteracts the results artmciai mea f the Helmand river from its old to its new bed, and °- the diar a suLh of water (no doubt much reduced in quantity as compared^with former years) along the whole length of the old river bed as far as the old Naizar. . -x. t» • • -a The old hed of the Helmand from its junction with the Parmn is recognised by the following local names (a) As far as Burj-i-As it is known as the Helmand; 'From Buri-i-As to the junction of the Shamshiri and Bahram ^hjm ( } irrigation bhanuels (due east of Deh Dost Muhammad) mth the main stream it is called the Gushtah ; ^ lc) From this junction to the old Naizar it is called the “ Sikh Sar’’. ( &gt; The Sikh Sar is little more than a deep ditch varying from 15 feet in width at the Bahram Khan channel to about 6 feet at the village of Yar Muhammad. The new bed of the Helmand appears to he generally known (by the Persians at least) as the Helmand and sometimes as the Pariun. 5 On the 25th September, I reached Deh Dost Muhammad. The next dav I’visited the site of the Akhundzada of Chakansur’s Camp which he pitched durinn- his recent visit to Persian territory in July last (referred to in my despatch No. 172, dated Mth July 1902). The camp appears to have been pitched about one and-a-half miles south-east of the village of Deh Dost Muhammad and some 150 yards west of the boundary hne (the oM Helma^ river bed). The Akhundzada is said to have built a few wattle and daub h ts on this spot, hut these were afterwards burnt to the ground by the Katkhuda of Deh Dost Muhammad. • 6 . Leaving Deh Dost Muhammad on 26th, I followed at intervals the course of the Sikh Sar for some distance into the old Naizar. At the point where the Sikh Sar enters the old Naizar is the village of Yar Muhammad on the right bank, said to have been newly built last year by the Afghans. jo this point also an artificial channel exists which is said to have been ui y the Afghans last year in prolongation of the main channel. Signs ot cu iv&lt;i- tion are visible on the Afghan side of the channel; but none exist on Persian side. The water was expected to reach this point in a day or two. Crossing the Pariun and Dashak on my return to Nasratabad on the 28P I found both watercourses dry. Latest reports are to the effect ia i Helmand water has not as yet reached more than two or three miles be ow Shaligul bund. 7. In normal years, when the Helmand river is full, the existence of the Shahgul bund is said to make little difference to the water-supply &gt; o Miankangi district j for then enough water passes through the bund in o Pariun to meet the wants of the Persian cultivators, and at the same ime fill the old Helmand river bed sufficiently to enable the Afghans to cairy their cultivation to a certain extent. It is only—as in the case ot the re 5 e drought—in the time of scarcity that the presence of the Shahgul bun 18 e ’ for then the old Helmand bed profits at the expense of the Pariun an Miankangi district.3&amp;£»anetssK. L 71 8. The Shahgul bund was reported in a former letter (No. 172 of 14th July) as having been destroyed by a flood in April last. I was informed at Deh Shahgul that it had only been partially destroyed, the mud work having been carried away while the brushwood remained. No repairs appeared to me to have been made to the bund since that date, but in place of the mud work a natural bank of sand had been formed against the brushwood from the north. Meeting this obstacle on the 25th the Helmand water had not sufficient strength to penetrate it at once, and thus it found its way into the Shahgul channel which, however, had been prepared by the Afghans to receive it. This accounts for the old bed of the Helmand having become filled with water, while the Pariun or main bed remained dry. In the same way, at the beginning of the recent drought, when the Helmand was drying up, the river, which ordinarily passes the Shah gul bund, was, owing to its diminished volume, unable to do so. The water consequently found its way into the Shahgul channel causing the Pariun and the Miankangi district to be denuded of water sooner than they would otherwise have been. Up to the present time the Persians do not seem to have raised any very serious objection to the Afghans drawing off water into the old bed of the Helmand river, and the fact that they at one time are said to have built a bund conjointly with the Afghans at the point of bifurcation of the old and new beds of the Helmand would seem to imply that they recognised the justice of allowing a certain amount of water to leave the Pariun for the benefit of the Afghans. In the above circumstances, it is perhaps open to question whether the Afghans can be charged with having interfered with the Seistan water-supply or only with having caused a premature cessation of it at a time when the natural drying up of the Helmand river in these parts was inevitable. Prom what I was able to see during my tour, wherever the Afghans had made a channel on the eastern bank of the old river bed, the Persians had dug a corresponding one on the opposite bank. 9.

The Akhundzada has flatly refused to allow water to pass the Shahgul bund to Miankangi, and Persians threaten reprisals.

During an interview with the Yamin-i-Nizam on the 5th September he told me that he had received orders to report whether the information that had been received by the Persian Government as to the Afghans having destroyed a bund and dug channels so as to denude the Miankangi district and Seistan of water was true. The Yamin told me that he had replied that the reports were false, and the present scarcity was due to natural causes only. He added that *• some one” must have submitted a very exaggerated account of the situation. No information that I have yet received has corroborated the report that the present drought is the result of the Afghans having destroyed a bund or dug channels from the Helmand. Since April last {vide paragraph 6 of my report No. 172, dated 4th July 1802, foYwarded to the Government of India with my letter No. 173 of the same date), the Afghans, as far as my information goes, have not been guilty of any encroachments along that portion of the river below the Seistan bund which forms the Goldsmid boundary between Seistan and Afghan territory. Above and to the south of the Seistan bund they appear to have repaired or constructed several bunds and to have dug channels {vide my telegram to the Government of India, No. 227, dated 17th August). Their having done so may possibly have accelerated the advent of the drought in Seistan ; it can scarcely be said to have been the direct cause of it. Owing to the drying up of the Helmand, the drought was in any case inevitable, and this view of the situation appears to be accepted by all local officials in Seistan. In this connection, however, Mr. Miller, during a recent visit I paid him, remarked to me that the present scarcity was due to the conduct of the Afghans. He stated that never before this year had a bund existed at Kila-i-Path. He implied that it had been specially constructed this year to catch the reduced flow of water in the Helmand. My information does not quite tally with this ; for I was informed that the Kila-i-Path bund was only repaired (as is done every year) by the new Governor of Kila-i-Path. An Agent has been sent to Kila-i- Path to collect all possible information on this subject. News has reached here to-day (15th September) that the Helmand has risen, and that the water has reached the Seistan bund. The report is generally believed to be true. If this is so, the spring harvest ought to be assured. The Karguzar of Seistan is said to have written to Meshed for permission to have the Seistan bund built of masonry. 8 .

Please refer to my letter No. 34 (Confidential), dated the 19th ^ September 190and your telegram of 4th October. The Minister for loieign Affaiis and the Minister of War have given positive assurances to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, that no increase of troops m Seistan is intended. 1 have communicated by telegraph and by messenger wit the British Agent at Birjand, and he confirms the information given m my tele gram of the 19th September. The British Agent says that three dastehs ov companies have recently left Kain for Seistan the usual strongt of t e company is 100 men. It is stated here that the strength of the Kain regiment in Seistan is 500. If therefore the force from Meshed and the force from Kam both reach Seistan, the force there, even if the Kain regiment is really recalled, Telegram, dated the 21st October 1902. will be increased by 400.74 Translation of a letter from His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan and its Dependencies, to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, No. 12, dated the 12th Rajab 1320 H., corresponding to the 15th October 1902. After compliments—I have received Your Excellency’s friendly letter, dated the 31st July 1902, and understood the contents, which were to the follow ing effect:— (His Highness quotes the whole letter.) I have also received Your Excellency’s second letter, dated the 3rd October 1902, ashing me to send urgently a reply on the subject. As I cordiallv desire that, in my communications and correspondence with Your Excellency, *1 should always express myself in sincere and open words, therefore, in some matters it becomes necessary that requisite enquiries should be carried out; and in this case also, I thought it proper to make due enquiries, and learn about the doings and behaviour of the “ Hakim ” of Chakansur. I learn that the said official only lays claim to those limits, which have been considered to belong to Afghanistan, as has been explained in the map prepared bv General Goldsmid, which was sent by Your Excellency on the 23rd July 1901, and that he has no desire to deviate from the boundary line laid down in the said map, and he does not rely on the course of the waters of the Helmand as delimiting the boundaries in those parts; because the waters of the river, owing to heavy°floods, sometimes flow in the direction of Seistan, and it is possible that they may at other times turn and flow to the Chakansur lands. It is clear in the map that General Goldsmid in illustrating his decision has drawn the boundary line between Chakansur and Seistan, by a red line; and he has shown the course of the river separately from the boundary line. Now the Persians say that some years ago the original stream of the Helmand used to be considered the boundary in that direction; that it has changed its course, and that the land which used to be on its west, lias now come out on its eastern bank; and they state that this change of the course of the river makes no difference whatever in that frontier, that the Hakim of Chakansur says that the present course of the river should be considered as the boundary, and all the land on the eastern bank of the river belongs to Afghanistan, although the said land, before the change of the course of the river from its old bed, belonged to the Persians. My dear friend, I have duly enquired into this matter from my officials at Chakansur; and the slight delay, which has occurred in replying to Your Excellency’s letter, was on this account, as I wanted to acquire proper knowledge of the matter. I now fully assure Your Excellency^ that the Hakim of Chakansur does not lay claim to any lands which are lying on the other side of the boundary line laid down in the map sent by Your Excellency. The map which Your Excellency has sent is now with me, and 1 have carefully examined it. Thus, a boundary line on the west in the form of an eclipse has been drawn in red ink, which begins at Koh-i-Malik Siah, and goes in a north easterly direction, leaving Ram-rud on the side of Afghanistan, and passes through the jointly owned lands of Afghanistan and Persia, close to Kila-i- Nawaz, and reaches at Kohak-band. Here the Helmand comes from Afghan istan on the east, and flows in a northerly direction ; and its^ course is marked by a blue line, which leaves the red boundary line on its west, and leaves the places well known as Nad-i-Ali and Kila-i-Kang on the east of Afghan istan. The river then runs on straight in a northerly direction and falls into a lake called Hamun-puzak, wdiich belongs to Afghanistan. Then the red boundary line passes to the west of Kohak-band, leaving the river and the said “band” on the side of Afghanistan, and then curving slightly goes on to the north at a distance of about 2 miles from Nad-i-Ali and 4 miles from Kila-i-Kang leaving these places on the east to Afghanistan. Then the line inclines to the north-w r est reaching Kila-i-Kulhak (Koluk ?), which it leavesal;out two miles on tlie side of Seistan, and then it passes straight on to the west; and leaving the lake known as Hamun-Sabur and Kcdi-i-Kuch on the side of Afghanistan, it joins the Koh-i-Siah, which is Persian territory. If this map, which Your Excellency has sent, contains the illustration of the settlement made by General Goldsmid in the year 1872 between the Persian and Afghan Governments, and, as Your Excellency writes that the said settle ment made by General Goldsmid has been binding' for more than twenty-five years, and been approved and accepted, I also now accept the said map! If, as the Persian Government has said, my officials at Chakansur have laid claim to those lands which formerly belonged to the Persians, and which during the last few years, owing to floods of'the Helmand, which has altered its course towards Seistan, have changed their position, and the land which was on the west of the said river has now come to be placed on the east of the river, I write that to these lands in dispute, provided they are, in accordance with the boundary line laid down in the map of General Goldsmid, on the other side and to the west of the said boundary line, I lay no claim and raise no dispute about them; on the contrary, I will prohibit my officials at Chakansur and instruct them not to interfere with Persian territory; and will direct the Hakim of Chakansur and the Hakim of Seistan, or any other official appointed on behalf of the Persian Government to look into the matter, to place the said map before them, and in a friendly and neighbourly spirit point out to each other the limits of their respective territorie°, and set up distinct marks, so that no dispute may again occur between them. I have made inquiries into the matter up to the point which I have mentioned above, and have now communicated to Your Excellency. I do not know whether the Persian Government wish to claim anything contrary to the existing map, and in excess of their former rights. If Your Excellency is aware of this, Your Excellency will be pleased to write to me, explaining their object. If their contention is worth being entertained, a discussion will be carried on through Your Excellency. As to what Your Excellency writes stating that the Persian Government has represented to His Majesty the King of England’s Government that, besides occupying land, which was until recently indisputably Persian, my subjects have destroyed the Persian dam of Band-i-Seistan near Kuhak,— my dear friend, as clearly the complaints of the Persian Government are against the officials of Chakansur, who are subjects of the God-granted Government of Afghanistan, and are friends and not subjects of the Government of His Majesty tlie King of England, I have written a reply above to the effect that the Hakim of Chakansur does not interfere with the land which is on the other side, to the west of the boundary line, as marked in the map of General Goldsmid, although owing to the flood and change of course of the stream, it may have come to be placed on this side of the Helmand and close to the western side of the boundary line. Eurther, as to what Your Excellency writes in the second letter, dated the 3rd October 1902, asking for replies to Your Excellency’s two previous letters, dated the 6th and 17th June 1902, I write to say that, as there has not occurred, nor does exist any fault in the foundation of the friendship and union between these two Governments, and as I have written in my former letters, I will, please God, preserve intact this thread of friendship and concord, which has come into my hands, as an inheritance, in the same manner ^ as my late father did bv his action and behaviour with sincerity and fidelity tovards the British Government; and I desire that similar action and behaviour may be adopted on the other side. Consequently, if, on account of certain urgent engagements, a few days’ delay may have occurred in sending a reply, it does not matter, as sometimes a similar delay has occurred on the other side. I hope to send replies to Your Excellency s two letters early and in a friendly manner, and that they will reach \ our Excellency.Telegram No. 337 (Confidential), dated Seistan, tlie 15th (despatched from Nushki 23rd) a 5 October 1902.

Local Government seem disinclined adopt Karguzar’s proposals to seek my intervention with Akhundzada. Mean while Seistanis have begun digging channel near Milak, which will draw olf water from old Helmand to Miankangi district. They are also said to be digging channel just above Shahgul bund, which will cut off bend in river and carry water to Pariun or Dashak—wcte map with my report 298. Yamin-i-Nizam tells me, he hopes, this action will act as lever, and force Afghans allow water pass Shah^ul bund. Afghans, I fear, are likely oppose this when mouths of channel approach Helmand bed; but even if they do not, they can, and it is said they intend to, open mouth of new canal at point B above Seistan bund mentioned in my last telegram, which is likely denude both Miankangi and lower Seistan of water.

From — His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty’s Secretary o£ State for India, London. Please refer to my telegram dated the 21st October 1902. His Highness the Amir has replied to my letters of the 31st July and the 3rd October 1902 about Seistan. His Highness explains the delay as due to his having had to refer to Chahansur. He makes no reference whatever to the proposed deputa tion of a British officer as arbitrator. He states that he does not rely on the main stream of the Helmand as fixing the boundary, though it is clear from the correspondence that his local officers have hitherto done so. The Amir argues that since the red boundary line on General Goldsmid’s map is shown to the west of the river, therefore the whole river from the Seistan bund to the Shah mil bund, which is down stream of the Seistan bund at Kohak, at any rate lies in Afghanistan. Apparently, also on the strength of the map, he claims the whole of the Hamun. He proposes to dispose of the dispute through the local Hakims, unless the Persians raise some contention worth being enter tained, when the discussion will be carried on through the Government of India. His Highness the Amir’s idea apparently is that, if Afghanistan retains the whole of the Helmand, including Seistan bund, he can do as he pleases with the water, and divert the whole of it to Chakansur and elsewhere.^ The local officials are to some extent trying to do this already. This contention is entirely opposed to General Goldsmid’s arbitral opinion, of which His High ness the Amir appears to be ignorant. I am awaiting a reply to an urgent communication made to His Highness the Amir through°the British Agent—please see my telegram of the 21st Octo ber 1902, and if, as is probable, he merely says he has already answered, I propose to write again at once explaining the nature of his mistake, and point- ing out what his subjects are doing and emphasising the Treaty aspect of the situation and the local danger of further delay. Benn reports that the situa tion is critical, and the march of 300 more troops from Birjand is confirmed. I therefore propose to let Major McMahon start, and halt, if necessary, at Nushki, as on His Highness the Amir’s reply depends whether Major McMahon must go round by Koh-i-Malik Siah, or whether he can march by the Helmand route.mm p i i i Telegram.

Miller has visited boundary line from Takht- ^ i-Shah to new channel which Persians w 7 ere said in above telegram to intend digging from point above Shahgul bund, this point is called Poozahi Jangjah, and canal will join Pariun at point (due north) called Lukhshakh —vide Trench’s map with Seistan diary, number six. When opened Persians hope no water will reach old Helmand. 700 armed labourers reported working between Jangjah and Lukhshak, Afghans reported watching operations from opposite bank. Have asked Plunkett on tour to report. Report regarding Afghan channel being dug from point B above Seistan bund to Jaroki —vide map with my 284—■ is again confirmed, this canal reported 18 feet wide, 12 deep; and 12 miles reported finished. Afghans hope it will permanently divert Helmand. Afghan Commandant with guard 100 men superintends work. Other troops warned to be present on day of opening. If Persians abandon Jangjah canal, Afghans would possibly postpone opening theirs at point B. At interview between Akhundzada and Yamin, reported paragraph 18, my 172 of 14th July, Yamin apparently promised produce maps and renew negotiations with Afghan Boundary Commissioner in month’s time. Akhundzada’s present attitude attributed to Yamin not having kept promise. Karguzar’s proposals to seek my intervention were apparently not approved by Yamin who, informant states, frequently consults Miller on frontier water question, also says Miller has allowed Persians to think we intend acquiring lands between Helmand, Taraku and Haozdar, and would then build permanent dam at Kamal Khan bund reducing Seistan’s water-supply. Water has now reached lands between Pariun, Nasratabad and villages to south-west, and crops are being sown. Spring harvest should be assured unless Afghans open channel at point B mentioned above.

His Highness the Amir has replied to His Excellency the Viceroy’s letters, dated the 31st July and 3rd October, about the Seistan dispute. He makes no reference to the proposed deputation of a British officer as arbitrator. He does not rely on the main stream of the Helmand as fixing the boundary, though correspondence shows that his local officers did. He proposes to dispose of the dispute through the local Hakims, unless the Persians raise some contention worthy of being entertained, when the discussion will be carried on through the Government of India. We are awaiting a reply to a communication made to His Highness the Amir through the British Agent at Kabul, and Major McMahon is completing arrangements for a start. Major Benn reports that the situation is still critical, and that the march of 300 more troops from Birjand is confirmed. Seven hundred armed Persian labourers are working on the new canal above the Shahgul bund which, the Persians hope, will prevent any water reaching the old Helmand bed. The Afghans, under the superintendence of a Com mandant, with a guard of one hundred men, are working on another canal above the Seistan bund which, they hope, will permanently divert the Helmand. The Yamin-i-Nizam frequently consults M. Miller, and disapproved of a proposal made by the Karguzar to seek Major Benn’s intervention in the matter. Water has now reached the lands between Parian, Nasratabad and villages to south-west, and crops are being sown. The spring harvest should, theiefore, be assured, unless the Afghans open the channel referred to above. Miankangi is dry.

On 2nd October, the Karguzar of Seistan and the Yamin-i-Nizam left Seistan on a tour along the Afghan frontier in order to visit the Shahgul bund, and verify the reports of the alleged interference of the Afghans with the water- supply of Seistan. It was stated that they took labourers with them to destroyEnclosure No. 82. Telegram, dated the tflsfc October 1902, Prom—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. Please refer to my telegram of the 27th October. Major Benn telegraphs on the 18th October that 700 armed Persian labourers are working on the new channel above Shahgul bund, and that the Afghans are watching operations from the opposite bank. The Persians expect that, when this channel is open, it will prevent water from reaching the old Helmand. The Afghans under a Commandant, with a guard of one hundred men, are working on a deep channel above the Seistan bund which, they hope, will permanently divert the Helmand. They have also warned other troops to be present on the opening day. The Yamin-i-Nizam, who frequently consults M. Miller, disapproved of a proposal made by the Karguzar to seek Major Benn’s intervention. Water has reached lands between Parium, Nasratabad and the villages to south-west, and spring harvest should be assured, unless the Afghans open this new channel. Miankangi is dry. Major Benn was instructed on the 18th October to tell the Akhundzada that His Highness the Amir would be held responsible if fresh canals were opened or new bunds constructed, and a collision resulted, inas much as, if His Highness had promptly answered my letters, the British arbitrator might have already reached Seistan. I have telegraphed the sub stance of this message, and of my telegram of the 27th October, to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran.Vn 1 utkesli teE tie if fell the bund, if necessary. Before their return to Seistan, reports had reached me from more than one source that finding a detachment of Afghan troops, who threatened to fire on them, occupying the Shahgul bund, the Karguzar and Yamin-i-Nizam were forced to retire. On this report reaching the city, the Deputy Governor, it is said, decided to despatch Sardar Purdil Khan to the Shahgul bund with a body of Seistani troops to destroy it. As these reports were generally believed to he true in the city, and it was quite probable that they would find their way to Meshed or Tehran in this form, 1 deemed it advisable to mention them in my telegram No. 32 i of Sth October to the Government of India. 3. My report No. 298, dated 30th September, shows clearly how the Shahgul bund and channel are able successfully to prevent any of the Helmand water from reaching the Miankangi district. I have also pointed out that in normal years the Helmand water easily passes the Shahgul bund and fills the Parian river bed, which is the main channel of supply for the Miankangi district. At the present moment, although Nasratabad and its adjacent villages, as also the villages along the Bud-i-Seistan, are supplied with water, the Miankangi district is absolutely 3 without any, owing to the existence of the Shahgul bund and channel. It is stated here that what the Afghans are striving for is to destroy the Seistan bund at Kohak and to construct a more permanent dam at Shah- o&gt;ul. By this means they hope that the Helmand water would again be perma- nentlv diverted into its old bed. The only argument the Afghans use in defence of their present action is that, with the shifting of the Helmand into its new bed the Miankangi district has become their property, and they, therefore, deny the Persians* right to cultivate it. These arguments they are able to support by a show of force, which is certainly superior in quality to anything the Seistanis can at present produce. T The Kar°-uzar and Yamin-i-Nizam returned from tour on the Sth, and I was able to have an interview with the former shortly after his arrival. I told him of the reports that had reached here regarding his tour. He said that he had found no Afghan troops whatever at the Shahgul bund; but that, after satisfying himself that no water was fiowing into the Pariun on account of the dam and Afghan channel at that place, the Yamin-i- Nizam had written to the Akhundzada°of Chakansur to allow the water to pass He had received a renlv from the Akhundzada at Deh Dost Muhammad declining the Yamin s invitation to meet and discuss the water question and refusing to allow the water to pass the Shahgul bund. The Karguzar and Yamin then continued rtpir fn„r alone the frontier as far as Takht-i-Shah. He said that, as far as he wa^aware there was no intention of sending Sardar Purdil Khan out to destroy the Shahirul bund- but he added that the Seistanis, in retaliation, intended to otn a disused chnai near Milak leading into Persian territory which would draw oft whatever water entered the old bed of the Helmand by the Afghan channel at Shahgul. . The Karguzar anticipated that, if the Seistanis did this, disturbances between themselves and the Afghan would result.

If, however, the Afghans do not oppose this work, they have still the whip hand; for a new channel at which they have been working for a considerable time with, it is said, some hundreds of labourers is now approaching completion at a point, south of the Seistan bund at Kohak, which, from the accounts the Karguzar has given me, corresponds exactly to point B marked on the map submitted with my report No. 284 of 20th September. This canal is stated to be 18 feet wide and to extend, at present, through the village of Khaogah as far as Jaroki which is situated a short distance east of Milak. If this canal, the bed of which is said to be lower than the main bed of the Helmand, is opened by the Afghans, it will—considering the present low state of that river—seriously reduce, if it does not entirely stop, the water-supply which reaches the city, its adjacent villages and the disk ict to the south of Nasratabad, by the B/ud-i-Seistan. Unless the Helmand comes down in much greater volume than at present, it would not be surprising to find not only the Miankangi district but the capital of Seistan again devoid of water. The attitude of the Afghans has been and still is most unfriendly ; and their present action, after a period of drought, is likely to be attended with such serious consequences as the stoppage of all cultivation not only in the most fertile and prosperous district of Seistan but in Seistan itself. 5.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Have visited Takht-i-Shah frontier and inspected new Persian channel at Poozahi Jangjah, and can confirm information given in my last telegram with following modifications. Jangjah channel was on point completion, 18 feet wide, 18 deep, one and a quarter of a mile long, northern mouth just below Shahgul bund, not at Lukhshakh. One thousand unarmed labourers were working under Miankangi headman who had small escorts. I saw no Afghan troops on opposite bank. As Afghans can nullify effect of Jangjah channel by opening their own above Seistan bund referred to in last telegram, it is unlikely they will oppose Persians, but general feeling is that new troops reported by Whyte as having left Meshed will overawe Afghans and prevent their digging counter-channels. Persians have abandoned work on channel near Milak reported in my 3d7 as under construction. Posted Meshed; addressed Foreign; repeated Agent, Governor-General, Quetta.

On the night of the 21st September, I received a visit from the Russian secret agent, mentioned in paragraph 8 of my diary, No. 17, for period 11th to 20th August 1901. He gave me the following information :— (a) The Russian Consul had lent his (my informant’s) services to the Yamin-i-Nizam during the recent disturbance on the Seistan-Afghan frontier, reported in my letter No. 172, dated 14th July 1902. The Yamin had paid all his expenses, and my informant was frequently employed to carry letters and messages between the Yamin and the Russian Consul. (b) The Russian Consul had told the Y&amp;min that I had supplied the Ahhundzada of Chakansur with a map of the boundary which was a false one, as it had no signatures on it. (c) The Russian Consul had given the Yamin a map of the Seistan-Afghan boundary with the names of places, &amp;c., written in Persian character. (d) That the Afghans claimed that their boundary ran from the Bund-i- Seistan along the Dashak to Killa Golak, and thence to the Bandan Hills. (e) That the Persians claimed the line to be from the Seistan bund to Nad Ali and then via Mazar-i-Baluchan and Pooza-i-Daki Tir to the Bandan Hills. (I am unable to locate Mazar-i-Baluchan and Pooza-i-Daki Tir on the map.) (/) The Russian Consul had told the Governor’s Nazr that the bunds which had been constructed on the Helmand this year at Kila-i-Fath, Kamal Khan, Chahar Bujak, Rudbar, Landi, Pallalak, Khan Nishin, &amp;c., had been built at the instigation of the British. In connection with the above information I would invite a reference to paragraph 19 of my report No. 172, dated 14th July 1902. 6. The Russian Consul was absent on tour from the 20th to the 22nd September. He visited the Bund-i-Seistan w ith Sardar Purdil Khan who hap pened to be there, and then returned to Nasratabad. 7. From the 23rd to the 28th I was absent on tour with the main object of ascertaining the facts as to the alleged interference of the Afghans with the water-supply of Seistan. A separate report on my tour has been submitted to the Government of India (No. 298, dated 30th September 1902). Copies of this report were at the same time forwarded to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed and the Hon’ble the Agent to the Gov ernor-General in Baluchistan. The itinerary of my tour was as under :— Miles. 23rd September, Kwaja Ahmad... 24th September, Deb Shahgul Fia Seistan bund and Helmand river. 25th September, Deb Dost Muhammad Eia Milak and old bed of Helmand. 26th September, Burj-i-Mir Gul ... 27tb September, Siadak Via Polgai, Khamak, Tappa Daolatabad, Pariun river. 28th September, Nasratabad ****** ... 14 ... 28 ... 20 On the 27tli, on my return to Nasratabad, I crossed the Pariun and Dashak rivers (main bed of tbe Helmand), and found them both diy, the water having reached only for a short distance beyond the Skahgul bund, and having been diverted at that point into the old bed of the Helmand via the fehahgul channel (built by the Afghans). The Shahgul bund, when the Helmand river bed is full, makes little difference to the inhabitants of Seistan, as sufficient water passes through it to satisfy the wants of the Persians. It is only in the time of scarcitv that its existence is felt, and that the Persians raise complaints {vide my report on this subject, No. 298, dated 30th September 1902).

Helmand haying risen is reported flowing both in old bed via Afghan channel at Shahgul and in Pariun via new Persian a channel at Poozah Jangjah. Hain has also fallen. This should temporarily * solve water difficulty, and unless Afghans re-open question by digging fresh channels, no reason why status quo should not continue. Afghan canal above Seistan bund via Khaogah to Jaroki now reported only half finished, requiring about month further work. My diary of 31st August, para graph 5, reported Akhundzada and Governor of Kila-i-Fath at variance. Latter recently under Kabul orders extended limits of his district into Akhundzada’s territory someway north of Khaogah which had been Akhundzada’s property. Akhundzada then dug Kushk Jaroki channel which divides Khaogah villages, and which, it is generally admitted, must inundate and destroy Khaogah when Helmand is in flood. By representing construction of this canal as best counter stroke to Persian encroachments, Akhundzada received Kabul approval to work, which also dealt blow against his Kila-i-Path rival. Latter unlikely permit opening of Kushk Jaroki canal. New aspect of situation should benefit Seistan, and internal dissension of Afghan Governors is perhaps good guarantee of maintenance of status quo, but Akhundzada is persistent in claiming Miankangi district, and may resent its cultivation by Persians. I am trying arrange visit Akhundzada in course few days. Addressed Foreign; repeated Agent, Gov ernor-General, Quetta; posted Meshed. 7 Telegram, No. 45, dated the 10th November 1902.

During Amir Sher Ali’s time a joint Commission from Persia ami Afghanistan and the British Government fixed the Helmand as the bountal line. Recently the Helmand has changed its course and has gone hevond Afghanistan and entered Persian territory. Seven months previously fnlfrltW officers who were on the spot on the part of Afghanistan, informed tte Amixof this change. The present Amir wished to get the frontier disputes settled between himself and the Shah without the intervention of the British Government, and His Highness has, therefore, appointed his own officers, so thatThev may get the matter settled after a discussion with the Persian officers. The Persian officers gave a reply that they would pay no attention to the Afghan officers’ statement unless it came through an English Commission. I tall find out something more on the subject, and let you know the result. No. 366, dated Seistan, the 29th October 1902 (Confidential). From— Major R. A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, rp 0 rfhe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of former correspondence on this subject ending with my telegram No. 362 of 26th October 1902, I have the honour to submit the_fol lowing report on a visit paid by me to the new Persian canal at Poozah Jang Jah and on the Seistan-Afghan water question as it stands at present. 2. A rough map to illustrate this report is attached herewith. 3 Pormer reports have shewn that, owing to the existence of the Afghan bund and channel at Shahgul ('X Y” on map), the Helmand water was unable to reach the Pariun, its present legitimate bed and the mam source of irrigation for the Miankangi district. * * . ' The Persian authorities had asked the Afghan Governor of Chikansur to allow the water to pass the bund, hut the latter had refused stating that he claimed the Miankangi district as Afghan territory. The Seistan authorities then decided to dig a channel above the Shahgul bund which would divert the water into the Pariun by cutting off a bend in the river at this point. This channel (“ A B *’ on map), has now been com pleted. It takes off from the main stream at a point 1 mile above the Shahgul bund called Poozah Jang Jah, and joins the Pariun quarter of a mile below that bund. When I visited this canal on the 23rd October, the day before it was opened, I found about 1,000 labourers under the superintendence of the three chief Katkhudas of the Miankangi district, working at the canal, which was then one and a quarter miles long, 18 feet wide, and 18 feet deep. Ims somewhat formidable piece of work had been finished in 11 days. Each Kat- khuda had a small escort of local men with him. The Katkhudas appeared to regard the work as a waste of time and labour; for they said that the Afghans would either open an old channel a little further up stream (“ C D ” on map) or else the Helmand itself would come down in flood and destroy the Shahgul bund. In any case they thought the Afghans would open their larger canal at Kushk (“ E E ” on map), which takes off from the main river above the Seistan (Kohak) bund and runs north to Jaroki. 4. The Persian channel at Jang Jah was opened on the 24th October. The Akhunzada of Chikansur with some 4i0 men personally watched the oper ations, but offered no opposition. The Helmand water from the latest reports is now gradually filling the Pariun river bed by means of the new channel, and at the same time the Helmand has suddenly increased in volume. The Karguzar, during a visit on the 27th October, informed me that he hoped the water would now reach both the Pariun and the old bed of the Helmand. He said that in view of the fact that the Helmand had risen and that the city and districts fed by the Bud*i-Seistan, now had a good supply of water, orders would be givento partially open the Kohak bund in order that an ample supply might reach the main stream below the bund and that the Afghans might thus get a fair share. A temporary solution of the water question would, therefore, appear to have been reached which should, for the present, satisfy both parties. It remains, however, to be seen whether the Afghans will not again re-open^ the question either bv drawing off the water into the old Helmand bed via the channel marked in the attached map at “CD” or by opening their larger work above the Kohak bund at “ E F The 'eneral feeling appears to be that the presence of the new troops, who are expected here at once for duty on the Seistan-Afghan border, and whose despatch to Seistan has already been reported by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-G-eneral at Meshed, will deter the Afghans from making any further encroachments. 5. I have referred in paragraph 4 of my report No. 339, dated 15th October to two channels which it was said the Seistanis proposed digging one near Milak and another “ close and above the Shahgul bund ” (now known as the Poozah Jang Jah channel). Owing possibly to the representations of the Karguzar who, as already reported, feared disturbances if the Milak channel, as beino* in territory disputed by the Afghans, was opened, orders were issued to discontinue its construction in favour of the Jang Jah channel, which is in undisputed territory. # A £ 6 I have reported that the Yamin-i-Nizam, who is the Agent ot the Persian Government for the Seistan-Afghan frontier, was stated to be m the habit of consulting the Russian Consul on matters connected with the Seistan- “ban water dispute. If we may judge by the frequent reports that have reached me from more than one source there is little doubt that this is so. In conversation, therefore, with the Karguzar, who seems inclined to he friendly to us Ind who is an intimate friend of the Yamin-i-Nmm, I have lately impressed on’ him that should i he Local Government be in need of_ advice on account of difficulties with the Afghan authorities they would be justified m referring to mf if the matter I Sided that I thought in view of the treaty on this subject they would not seek advice elsewhere.

To the remonstrance referred to in telegram of the 21st, the Amir, as antici- I pated, merely replied to the Kabul Agent that he had already sent me a suit able answer. I am now addressing Amir again, pointing out misconcep tion under which he rests as regards the Goldsmith boundary, the serious danger of collision with the Persians if matters remain unsettled, and urging him to issue instructions to facilitate McMahon’s journey without delay. It is possible he may refuse to accept arbitration, and may adhere to his argument that, as he admits the red line with which the boundary is marked in Goldsmith’s map, there is nothing to arbitrate about. It is also the case that the Helmand having risen, both parties are now getting an ample supply of, water, and the dispute, if the Amir orders his men not to cross the old bed, is no longer acute. Case for compulsory arbitration may, therefore, be somewhat difficult to maintain. bro /Qj No. 52, dated the 24tli November 1902.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To— His Highness the Amir Sir Habibulla Khan, G.C.M G., of Afghanistan. My valued and esteemed emend, I have received Your Highness’s friendly letter, dated the 15th October 1902. I can quite understand that, in a matter of such importance. Your Highness should have considered it desirable to consult your 9® c F ’ it if clear that they have not kept Your H.ghness fu ly ^ present position of affairs concerning which I have the latest information There can be no doubt that Your Highness’s local officers did at first chum that the boundary of Afghanistan followed the main stream ^ Be nr &gt; and to assert this principle they crossed the line lai ovm y , ca e( j ^ and entered what has hitherto been regarded as Persian ^ ’ , friendly some time at I)eh Host Muhammad across the bon ei. u oioitated intervention of the British Consul, this act mig it rea i y hostilities, as armed bodies were present on both sides. our ig less aware of these facts. The Persians have n the British Government that they are expecting the arnya o i ^ tor whose presence they have invoked under Treaty stipula ion, p &amp; 1315 F. D.100 nDDparance I have information that considerable bodies of Persian troops are on their way to the spot. The British Consul has also reported, after yisitin ? the place that the whole of the water of the Helmand which passed the Rohak bund was, at the end of September, when water was urgently required for the Rabi sowings, being diverted into the old channel of the Helmand by an Afghan bund at Shahgul and a channel dug by the Afghans just above this bund and that the whole of lower Persian Seistan was thereby left without water The local Persian authorities had remonstrated with the Afghan officials who refused to allow any water to go down to Persian Seistan. Since then it appears that the Persians have been engaged in constructing another channel above the Afghan channel in order to counteract it, and that the Afghans have now begun a third channel above the Persians. Seven hundred men are working on the Persian channel ; and the position is one that may at any moment produce a conflict. 11 v friend, I now turn to Your Highness’s interpretation of the frontier as settled by Colonel Goldsmid. Your Highness has informed me that you do not rely on the main stream of the Helmand as fixing the boundary of the two States since the course of that river is undoubtedly liable to great and sudden changesbut that you now consider the boundary of Afghanistan to be fixed bv the’red line on the map wTiich was prepared in 1872 to illustrate Colonel Goldsmid’s award. A copy of this map with, the award was sent at that time to Amir Slier Ali through Saiyid JN T ur Muhammad Shah, the Afghan Commis sioner, and a second copy of the map by itself was forwarded to Amir Abdur Mahman Khan with my letter of the 24th July 1901. It would seem that Your Highness in examining the question of the frontier has only inspected the map, and has not studied the award. It contains these words “ The main bed of the Helmand therefore below Kohak should be the eastern boundary of Persian Seistan, and the line of frontier from Kohak to the hills south of the Seistan desert should be so drawn as to include within the Afghan limits all cultivation on both banks of the river from the bund upwards * * * It is, moreover, to he well understood that no works are to be carried out on either side, calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the Helmand.” Now from this description, which the map is merely intended to illustrate, it is clear that the boundary is not the red line, but the bed of the river along which it runs. This also is evident from other and larger maps where the painted 'line runs dow n the middle of the river and not along its left hank. I send Your Highness a copy of one of these maps in which the boundary of the two States is marked, as it always has been in larger maps, by different coloured lines and alternate dots running down each hank of the river. It is only because the map sent to Your Highness’s father is on a small scale that the red line is drawn upon it along the left bank, in order that the red paint may not be mixed with the blue paint. It is not the case therefore, as stated by Tour Highness, that by Colonel Goldsmid’s decision the whole of the river below the Kohak bund and the Kohak bund w r ere left to Afghanistan, or that Your Highness’s subjects are at liberty to do what they please with the w j ater below Kohak. Further, it is clear from the aw r ard of Colonel Goldsmid and from correspondence that passed between Atta Muhammad Khan, Khakwani, British Agent at Kabul, under instructions from the British Government, and Saiyid Nur Muhammad Shah, the Sadr Azam, in February 1871, in consequence of enquiries made by the latter as to the meaning of this portion of the award, that the Persians have the same right to make channels on their si :e of the river below Kohak as the Afghans have to make them on theirs, and that channels should not be constructed by either party which will interfere with the water in the old ones. These then are the facts. Your Highness and your officials are apparently under a misapprehension as to the true position of the boundary fixt j d by Colonel Goldsmid; and Your Highness’s subjects, and the subjects of the Persian Government on the spot, are engaged in works and counter-works which are contrary to the Agreement, and have thereby become involved in disputes which can only be settled by the intervention of an officer of experience and independent judgment, who will visit the’spot and will there mark out clearly in accordance with the map the boundary as laid dow r n by Colonel Goldsmid, and will decide as to the bunds and channels which eachparty sLoukl be allowed to maintain. In no other way can the dispute be satisfactorily settled. The Persian Government have appealed to the British Government to appoint an arbitrator as long ago as the 22nd July 1902, and the British Government have signified their intention to do so. lour Highness is also bound to be guided by the British Government in your relations with foreign Powers such as Persia. The British Government have, therefore, a grave responsibility in this matter, and, as I have recently by telegram and special letter fionr Landi Ivotal requested the British Agent to inform you, they cannot permit the interests of peace and of lour Highness’s territories and subjects in Seistan to be imperilled by neglect to settle the questions at issue. Ihere is another matter of which lour Highness does not appear to be aware. Prom information in my possession I am led to believe that the Persians have for some time been in occupation of a place called Takht-i-Shah on the edge of the Naizar on the side towards Chakansur which is on the Afghan side of the frontier as determined by the Colonel Goldsmid. If this be the case s it seems desirable that the Persian Government should evacuate a place which is within lour Highness’s territory. Por all these reasons I have decided to appoint Major McMahon as arbitrator to settle these disputes, and I have directed him to proceed at once on the road towards Seistan. I must ask lour Highness to depute a trusted official to meet him, and I shall he glad if you will issue immediate orders that Major McMahon may be permitted to proceed to Seistan via Khwaja Ali on the Helmand, and that your officer should meet him there and arrange for his supplies, lour Highness may rest assured that the interests of your territory will be safe in the hands of the British arbitrator, who will impartially con sider the claims of each side, and that if he be not sent, trouble and detriment to lour Highness and your people in the direction of Seistan will ensue. I have asked my Agent in Kabul to deliver this letter himself to lour Highness, and to ask for a reply which he may send at once by your special sowars to Peshawar, since it is undesirable in a case of so much moment, where the Persian Government is ready, and where also the British Govern ment have made their preparations, that there should be any further delay on the part of the Afghan Government. All else is well, and I hope lour Highness is in good health. Ae /0U- Telegram, dated the 24th November 1902.

In a telegram, dated the 23rd November, His Excellency the Viceroy of India has expressed an opinion that if the Amir accepts the red line marked in Colonel Goldsmid’s map, and orders the Afghans to retire behind the old bed of the river, it might be difficult to maintain case for compulsory arbitra tion now that the supply of water, for both parties, is ample. I have, in a communication to the Persian Minister here, gone no further than saying that I am glad to hear of the rise in the river Helmand by which the dispute would be rendered less acute. Ends. 7 No. 386, dated Seistan, the 13th November 1902. From Major R. A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, To —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit the following report in connection with my recent visit to the Akhunzada of Chikansur. * 2. The object of my visit was primarily to make his acquaintance person ally, to discuss the subject of Muhammad Umr Khan Nausberwani’s expected return to the vicinity of the Chikansur district, and to explain to the Akhunzada the terms of your telegram, No. 284.8 F., dated 18th October 1902, regarding the action of the Afghans in connection with the Helmand water dispute. 3. I met the Akhunzada on 6th November, the place of meeting being the old Helmand river bed which forms the Goldsmid boundary line. The Akhunzada had selected for the interview a spot on the Persian side of the line close to where he pitched his camp in July last and at the same place where he met Colonel Trench in March 1901. I deemed it prudent, however, to fix the rendezvous on the boundary line itself and eventually I was able to arrange this. The Afghan Boundary Commissioner and the Commandant of the Chikan sur troops w 7 ere also present at the interview, and the Akhunzada had a Guard- of-Honour of about 100 men to receive me on my arrival. 4. After dismissing everyone, except the officials mentioned above, the Akhunzada himself immediately broached the subject of the recent water dis pute. He inveighed against the Persians and their encroachments, and incident ally admitted that he had given orders for the destruction of their Bund at Kohak. He then produced a tracing of a map illustrating Sir F. GoldsmkPs arbitral opinion of 1872, evidently the one sent to His Highness, the late Amir, by the Government of India in July 1901. He wished to draw me into a discussion of the merits of the respective claims of the Afghans and Persians, and asked me to express my opinion on the situation generally. This I refrained from doing, pointing out that I had come to visit him in a friendly way^ in order to represent to him the desirability of maintaining the status quo until the arrival of a British arbitrator. I then explained to him in the terms of the Govern ment of India telegram quoted above, that had His Highness the Amir promptly replied to the Government of India’s communications addressed to him as far back as July last, a British arbitrator might already have reached Seistan for the settlement of the water question, and that, therefore, the respon sibility for any disturbance of the status quo resulting from the construction of new Afghan channels or bunds, or from the destruction by them of existing Persian ones, pending the arrival of an arbitrator, would be held by the Gov ernment of India to rest with His Highness the Amir. The Akhunzada, after referring to the Boundary Commissioner and Com mandant, gave me his assurance that, provided the Persians gave a similar pro mise, he on his part would not cause any new works to be constructed, and that he would not interfere with the Bund-i-Kohak. He then informed me that he had just constructed a hund (called the Jaroki Bund) across the Helmand midway between the Seistan Bund at Kohak 1315 F. D. ' ■ m104 and the Pariun Bund at Shahgul ; but this, he said, was no new work, for it was what the Afghans had done annually for several years past. 5 Referring to the question of Muhammad Umr, Nausherwani, the Akhunzada informed me that he hod received instructions from Kabul not to allow him to remain on or near the frontier ; but that should Muhammad Umr arrive in bis district he would furnish him with transport so as to enable him to continue his journey without delay. ' My interview with the Akhunzada then tei minuted. 6 On my return journey to Nasratabad I marched through the Miankangi district yisiting the old Helmand river bed at Pokak and following the course of the Lukhshak channel to the Pariun. _ The Lukhshak is one of the main Persian irrigation channels of the Miankangi district. It supplies the Siadak and Deh Dost Muhammad villages and district with water. It receives its water from the main bed of the Pariun, which at the time of my visit was receiving a plentiful supply of water by means of the new Persian channel at Poozah Jangjah, referred to in former reports. On either side ot the Lukhshak are the Milak and Takhti Shah channels which feed the Milak and Takhti Shah districts, respectively. 1 found the Lukhshak and Milak channels full of water. The Takhti Shah channel was dry; hut some oO labomers had ainved to prepare and clear it. They stated, however, that as the Akhunzada had iust built the bund at Jaroki, the water would with difficulty fill their channel. At the moment of my visit there was water in the main Pariun stream as far as Tilfak. I next visited the Akhunzada’s bund at Jaroki and found it at the point of completion, though, as always happens with the Helmand brushwood bunds, the water was flowing through it. This channel diverts the water into the Afghan channel shown on the map submitted with my last report, fto. 366, dated 29th October 1902, as at (Cj \H), and referred to therein at paragraphs 3 and 4. 7. On my return to Nasratabad I visited the Deputy Governor, theKargu- zar and the Yamin-i-Mzam, the officer in charge of the Seistan frontier. I informed them of that portion of my interview which referred to their Govern ment, and told them of the Akhunzada’s promise to maintain the status quo on condition that the Seistan Government would give a similar promise, ihe Deputy Governor and Karguzar expressed their willingness to do this, though the Deputy Governor made his promise conditional on the approval of his father, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, to wffiom he proposed reterring the matter. The Yamin-i-Nizam, who regarded my visit as unnecessary, stated that the Persians were quite capable of looking after their ow r n interests themselves. He would therefore give me no assurance. 8. With regard to the present water-supply, the conclusion I arrived at, after having personally visited all the main watercourses from Deh os Muhammad to the Jaroki Bund, was that a very fair division of the Helmand water below the Seistan Bund at Kohak was taking place. The He man itself had risen considerably, and it still continues to do so. The Jaroki un , though it will divert a good deal of water to Afghan territory, ought not, wi the main stream in its present state, to make much difference to the supply of the Miankangi district, while if the Helmand continues to iise or e Persians open the Kohak Bund, it is probable that both the Jaroki an e Pariun Bunds would he carried away, thus re-establishiug the situation w ic normally obtains in Seistan. Under the above circumstances it is perhaps not unreasonable to hope that the status quo will be maintained until the arrival of a British arbitra oi. 0 only disturbing element in the situation is the possibility of interference y Kussian Consul through the Yamin-i-Nizam, wffio, it has been pointed ou i former reports, seems inclined to seek Mr. Miller’s advice. 9. Since writing the above report I have received a communication fiom the Karguzar of Seistan in which he implies that my visit to the A.K was an interference in the internal affairs of this province and m w ic requests me in future to transact local business through him. Prom his e it would appear that he was compelled to address me on this subject owing o105 communication he had received from the Yamin-hNizam, who, it is not un likely, was instigated to address the Karguzar hy the Russian Consul. 10. A copy of this report is under despatch to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan and to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India for Khorasan and J eistan. / /to /ft % Confidential. Extract from, Sets tan Confidential Diary No. 15 of Major R. A. D. Renn, Hii Rritannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain, for period 1st to 15th November 1902. 1. The Russian Consul’s special Agent for the frontier, mentioned in para graph 1 of my last diary, paid me another visit on 4th November and gave me the following information :— (b) during Muhammad Umr, Nausherwani’s recent visit to Dak-i-Dehli on the Helmand last month, Passand Khan, the Baluch, lately in charge of the Russian postal arrangements, had visited Muhammad TTmr Khan and returned here with a letter from him for Mr. Miller. My informant states he was in Mr. Miller’s office when Passand Khan delivered the letter, and that Mr. Miller answered the letter immediately, writing—as he often does on urgent occasions—the reply himself. He then despatched Passand Khan with the letter and 250 krans as a present for Muhammad Umr ; {c) the Russian Consul had recently sent 90 loads of wheat and barley to Bamrus or Asperun from a village near here (Bunjar), and he had also bought 11 khawars each (165 Indian maunds) of wheat and barley which were to be despatched as soon as possible. This information has been con firmed from other sources. ***** 4. Prom the 5th to the 8th November I was absent on a short tour, during which I paid the Akhunzada of Chikansur a friendly visit. I also traversed the greater portion of the Miankangi District and inspected the main water channels between Deh Dost Muhammad and the Jaroki Bund (marked as “c d” on the map submitted with my report No. 366 of 29th October. The Bund is at point “ c ” on the above map). The itinerary of my tour was as under :— 5th November 6th „ 7th Hh ,, Miles. 26 18 45 . Deh Dost Muhammad .... . Halt. . Pokak (vid Deh Lutdh) .... . Nasratabad via the Lukhshak channel, Milak, Pariun, Poozah Jangjab, Jaroki Bund, Deh Gazima Mast Khan) .... 5. I visited the Akhunzada of Chikansur on 6th November on the frontier line near Deh Dost Muhammad. The Akhunzada had wished to see me on the Persian side of the line and had selected a site near the spot where he encamped with his force last July. I deemed it prudent, however, to avoid this, and was able to arrange for the rendezvous to take place in the bed of the old Helmand river, which forms the Goldsmid boundary line and which at this point is at the present moment dry. The details of my visit, during which I was able to obtain an assurance from the Afghan Governor that he would maintain the status quo pending the arrival of a British arbitrator, have already been reported in my letter to the Government of India, No. 3S6, dated 13th November 1902. Copies of this report were at the same time sent to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General for Khorasan and Seistan at Meshed. My visit to the Akhunzada has been the subject of some discussion locally. The Yamin-i-Nizam, Officer in charge of the Seistan Frontier, who, I have more than once reported, appears to be much influenced by Mr. Miller, whom he undoubtedly consults on frontier matters, particularly resented my visit. He caused the Karguzar of Seistan to address me on the subject in a letter which implied that I had inter fered in the internal affairs of this province. During a visit the 1 amin-i-Nizam paid me, he stated that he thought my visit quite unnecessary, and that the local Government were quite capable of looking after themselves and were prepared to do so by force of arms, if necessary. He added that he did not understand why I had endeavoured to solve the question for them, and that if the local Government stood in need of assistance or advice, they knew where to seek it.As during a previous visit the Tamiu-i-Nizam had admitted to me that the Russian Consul had explained certain paragraphs which recent y appeared in the Pioneer and Times of India with reference to the contemplated de- snatch of an Arbitration and Delimitation Commission to Seistan in connec- t on with the Seistan-Afghan water dispute, I replied that if the local Govern ment were in need of advice on matters Afghan, I should expect them to seek it at the British Consulate and nowhere else. He said he quite understood what I referred to and added that, if advice was offered to him from another quarter, it would be impolite on his part to refuse it. We may, perhaps, assume, there fore that the reports which have been reaching me for some time past of the Yamin-i-Nizam’s preference for the Russian Consuls assistance and advice,are not without foundation The interview terminated in a most friendly way, and may not, perhaps, be without good results. 6. The Helmand water continues to rise and, as already reported, in spite of the Afghan Bunds, there appears to be a very fair division of water below the Kohak Bund at the present moment. The only element which might disturb the present satisfactory state of affairs is the possibility of an attempt by Mr. Miller, through the Yamin-i-Nizam, to embroil matters. 7. The Amir Pan], Isa Khan, who was in Seistan last year, has arrived here from Birjand with a few sowars. He states that he is to be in command of the new troops who are expected to arrive here shortly. The 50 cavalry, who recently deserted from the Yamin-i-Sizam, have returned here having been arrested near Sabzewar. In addition to the above, about 70 irregular cavalry have arrived. Fifty of these are stated to be for the use of the Customs. It is said here that, of the three regiments which are being sent to Seistan, one is for the Koh-i-Malik Siah frontier, one for the Seistan-Afghan border, and one for Seistan itself. 8. During the past fortnight the price of all food-stuffs and grain has risen very considerably. The prices are about treble of what they weie last year.92 Enclosure No. 109.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 52, dated the 24th November 1902, on the 30th idem, by the evening dak, and to state that I applied to His Highness for an interview to which he consented and called me to the fort on the 1st December at 3 p.m. The letter from His Excellency the 1 iceroy, to His Highness the Amir, was presented hy me at the interview. After the Amir had read the letter, I represented to His Highness how important and urgent the matter is, and that the arbitration 'would evidently prove beneficial to his own country. His Highness the Amir was not definite as to the time by which he would be able to give reply to the important letter, and, on mty requesting an early reply, His Highness said that he would be able to answer the letter within a week. As to the despatch of the dak by the special sowars, His Highness said that no arrangements could be made and the reply, consequently, would be sent down by the usual dak. 2.

Please refer correspondence between Meshed and Charge d Affaires, Tehran, regarding despatch of Persian troops to Seistan, ending with Tehrannamely, on 19th October, 70 Cavalry under Sarhang Saiyid ITmar Shah ; about OOH, November 300 Kaini Infantry ; on 4th December 500 Karaye Infantry 2 °, t l TOO Cavalry from Meshed under Shuja-ul-Mulk. There are also 50 Pavalry with Yamin-i-Nizam. This makes total new troops 1,020, of which 220 are Cavalry and 800 Infantry. The 50 Cavalry of Yamin are said to be leaving immediately; the 300 Kaini Infantry are said to be in relief of Kaini troops already quartered here; latter supposed to be oOO strong, but 100 would be very liberal estimate ; many have deserted, many have bribed Governor during past three years and been allowed to return to Kain. Officer Commanding new troops has asked to inspect old Kaini troops and has refused to occupy barracks in city until latter march out and the Local Govern ment quite unable to comply, are making excuses and endeavouring square Shuia-ul-Mulk not to report deficiencies. Statement of Tehran authorities that new troops have been sent in relief appears to have been made in ignorance of above state of affairs. There are practically no troops to relieve here, but assuming that 300 local men can be produced to represent old Kami regiment and that Yamin , s 50 Cavalry leave Seistan, balance in excess still remains at 670 men. Shuja-ul-Mulk and officers of new troops have openly stated to three different agents of mine that they have been sent here on account of reports sent to Tehran by Belgians and Bussian Consul of doings of British in Seistan such as importation of arms, ammunition and troops. In this connec tion kindly see last paragraph of my telegram No. 159, dated bth July. Shuia-ul-Mulk has draft on Governor for 120,000 krans and 8,000 _ maunds wheat.

From—The Viceroy, Calcutta, To—The Secretary of State, London. Please refer to Your Lordship’s telegram dated the 31st October 1902. Maior Berm telegraphed on the 7th December 1902, that between the 19th October and 4th December 170 cavalry and 800 infantry arrived in Seistan from Kain and Meshed. The Kain troops, who were previously in Seistan, and whom part of the new troops are professedly to relieve, are supposed to be 500 strong but a liberal estimate of their actual strength would be 100, the rest being absentees. The local authorities naturally desire to conceal this, but practically there are no troops to be relieved. Thus there is a large increase of the local force. The Shuja-ul-Mulk, Commanding the force from Meshed, gives out that troops have been sent owing to reports by the Belgians and the Russian Consul of the doings of the British in ^eistan. He has a draft on the Governor for 120,000 krans and 8,000 maunds of wheat. ! amine prices obtain in Seistan and provisions are procurable with much difficulty for e Consulate.

D.BBSSRSCU imii 1111111 iiiiFTpnTnnn mmmn'''' 112 sent to me; and that I considered the red line, which had been fixed as the mark of the dividing boundary, to be the correct one, and that I did not place reliance on the course of the river, which was liable to sudden and great changes. It was for this reason that in the map sent by Your Excellency, the line of demarcation between the territories of the two Governments was drawn clearly in red ink ; and I therefore send a copy of the said map for Your Excellency’s inspection, so that Your Excellency may know that in my previous letter also I supported Your Excellency’s statement regarding the red line in the map as being correct. If a copy of the explanation of the award which Your Excellency now sends and which was existing on Your Excellency’s records, had been separately sent to me with the map, I would have inspected it and then written and corresponded accordingly with Your Excellency. However, as there appears to be no material difference between these two maps, I accept this map also as I did the former, and consider it as a correct document. Your Excellency states that in the explanation of the award of Colonel Goldsmid it is written—“ The main bed of the Helmand below Kohak should be the eastern boundary of Persian Seistan, and the line of frontier from Kohak to the hills south of the Seistan desert should be so drawn as to include within the Afghan limits all cultivation on both banks of the river from the bund upwards.” According to what Your Excellency states and from the map sent at present it appears to me that the boundary lines between these two States at Kohak Band are the red and blue lines, the red marks the limit of the Persian territory and the blue marks the limit of Afghanistan ; further, some black dots have also been placed as marks on both banks of the river from Kohak to the village Idu, which belongs to Afghanistan, and thus the water of the Helmand coming from Afghanistan on the east turns to the north and passes between Kohak, which belongs to Afghanistan, and Kimak, which belongs to Persia, in a northerly direction; then the river passes about two miles to the left of the Kamran village and at a distance of a mile and a half from Nad Ali, near Boorj-i-As and Deh Idu; then leaving the line of bound ary on the west, the water of the Helmand flows in a northern direction, and falls into the Hamunpuzak. All the said villages, viz.&gt; Deh Kamran, Nad-i- Ali, Boor]-i-As and Deh Idu, are on the east of the said river, within the limits of Afghanistan. Then the boundary line at Deh Idu leaves the river towards the north and runs to the west, and from the north of Deh Agha Jan, which is within the district of Seistan, it enters the Hamun Taburi, and crossing it passes towards Koh Siah, where it ends. I accept this map also in accordance with the description given above. 1 also assure Your Excellency that my officials have up to the present acted in accordance with the above arrangement, and that they have never interfered in the Persian territory as Your Excellency writes and as the Seistanis complain. This village called Deh Dost Muhammad, which was the camp of the Hakim of Chakansur and his men, although its name is not entered in the map which Your Excellency sent to me, comes within the limits of Afghanistan, according to the award of Colonel Goldsmid ; and the Persians anticipating the Afghans have entered Takht-i-Shah on the border of Naizar, which, Your Excellency knows, belongs to Afghanistan. If Your Excellency had not considered this matter as being of such great importance, the Hakim of Chakansur would have turned out the Seistanis from his district. As to what Your Excellency states that considerable bodies of Persian troops had entered Seistan, and if the friendly intervention of the British Consul had not been exercised, it was possible that hostilities would have been easily provoked. My dear friend, I have hopes that the Afghan people who are in a friendly alliance with the illustrious British Government on an occasion arising, will be able, by the help of the Almighty God, to become a bar to the very powerful enemy, whom Your Excellency knows ; and as to the Persian troops coming to Seistan and to the territory within their own limits, there is no occasion for fear of any kind and there is no danger in their doing so.

From— Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To — Major McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., Quetta. Amir has agreed to march of mission via Khwaja Ali and Helmand. Inquires dates, marches and number with view to^ provision of supplies. Akhundzada of Chakansur nominated as his Commissioner. Hopes party will not be very large. Secretary of State’s sanction asked to immediate despatch of mission. Pending reply please wire possible date of departure, marches with dates and numbers. We propose if you see no objection to tell Amir that you will use own supplies except wood, milk and grass, on journey to Seistan, but that he should collect supplies there and at suitable points, which you might now nx ta replenish your supplies, while there and on return journey. ‘in - Extract from a telegram to the Secretary of State, dated the 19th December 1902.

From— Sie A. H. Hardinge, Tehran, To The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Tour tele-ram of the 18th December. The Grand Vizier’s expression of surprise at the° information as to troops in Seistan, which he estimates at 400114 infantry and 70 cavalry shows that he thinks Major Benn must be mis informed. He has promised to procure exact particulars from the Way Office and asserts that, as the rise of the Helmand seems likely to settle the dispute, there is no ground for increasing the Persian force. I hear that the Russian Legation is trying to associate in some way a Russian representa tive with the personnel of the Afghan frontier settlement or, that failing, to prevent our arbitrating. This may explain anxiety of Persians to avoid the latter on the ground that the dispute is now over. Sent to Foreign Office and Meshed. Telegram, dated the 22nd (received 25th) December 1902.

Please telegraph me early orders on this point. Number of mission, twelve British officers, and about twelve hundred men, of these half are camelmen, but perhaps it is hardly necessary to inform Amir of exact number. In writing to Amir I advise avoiding request for assistance in any specific terms as suggested. I recommend telling him that we shall largely use our own supplies, but beg he will order local officials to render any assistance required in supplies and other ways. I have already arranged for some supplies in Seistan, and if Persians prevent further local purchase of supplies, I am confident of ability to purchase what I wish from Nushki, wherever required. and convev them * /20 Telegram, dated the 2f'th December 1902.

McMahon, who will presumably be given rank of Local Colonel, should perhaps receive a Loyal Commission on analogy of Pamir and Burma-Chma Missions, to settle boundary and irrigation disputes. It would save time if this ^ were sent to him direct to Quetta. It is not known here if Goldsmid received a Loyal Commission or letter of instructions only.

The Russian Minister had asked the Shah fo allow a Russian delegate to accompany the Persian Commissioner and His Males tv without consulting him, had replied that he saw no objection The Pu sian Minister now insisted that His Highness should give effect to what he caUed he Shah’s pledge, and, as he felt sure that we should demur to tins, he preferred!as did also His Majesty, to shelve arbitration altogether. 1 T ’ . hi , was easy. The Persian Government could not nrodifv article 6 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857 without our consent ; it ormld at most oulv promise Lussia to ask us if we objected to her, and if we did, as I felt certain would be the case, inform her of my reply and of Persia’s own treaty obligations. . u xv t&gt; • oi + The Grand Vizier said that he would communicate the Russian proposal to me officially after seeing the Shah to-morrow. I propose replying that no justification Mists for it in the Treaty, and that we cannot admit Russian intervention in any form.120 I think it probable that, even if Persia refuses the Russian delegate, the Russian Consul in Seistan will proceed to the spot at which our Commissioners meet to “watch proceedings” and make mischief. It might therefore be preferable to arrange that that spot should be in Afghan territory, which he cannot enter. Kharita, dated Camp Delhi, the 1st January 1903. From—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, To—-His Highness Amir Sir Habibulla Khan, G.C.M.G., of Afghanistan. My valued and esteemed friend, I have received Your Highness’s friendly letter, dated 9th Hecember 1902, in which you intimate your consent to the march of Major McMahon's Mission to Seistan via Khwaja Ali and the Helmand, and the appointment of Akhundzada Pakir Muhammad Khan, Hakim and Sarhaddar of the district of Chakansur, as Your Highness's Commissioner to assist Major McMahon in his enquiries into the disputes about the boundary and the irrigation from the Helmand in Seistan. I also understand that Your Highness has agreed to the arbitration being conducted in the manner mentioned in my letter dated 3rd October 1902, which was to the following: effect:— “ I would also suggest, for Your Highness’s consideration, that the same arrangement should be made as was agreed to in the case of General Goldsmid’s arbitration in 1871, that the decision of the ofiBcer appointed as arbitrator should be referred to the Persian and Afghan Governments, and that, if either Government objects to the award, it should be forwarded to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in England, whose decision should be final and binding on both parties.” The Persian Government has agreed to this arrangement. My friend, I have now to thank you for your friendly letter accepting the arrangements which I had proposed and which, I trust, will conduce to the welfare of your subjects in Seistan and to the cordiality and strength of the friendship between the two Governments. For such an object I gladly accept any such expenditure as may be involved in the despatch of this Mission ; and, in order that it may be efficiently conducted, I shall send with it officers experienced in irrigation, who will, I trust, after full examination on the spot, be able to devise some means not only of dividing the water in an equitable manner, but also of improving: the existing supply. Exclusive of the escort, which will consist of two companies of infantry and one troop of cavalry with the necessary followers and camelmen, the British officers will be six in number. The Persian Government has been made acquainted with the strength of the escort which I am about to send, and which will be required for a visit to the frontiers of Persia and Baluchistan, which Major McMahon has been instructed to undertake after his work in Seistan is completed. He has with him supplies which he will use on the journey, but I gladly avail myself of your friendly offer of assistance, and trust that Your Highness will forthwith issue instruc tions to your frontier officers to assist him with supplies or in any other way that may facilitate his march. He will leave Quetta on the 10th January, and should reach Khwaja Ali by about the 31st of that month. From that date his movements wdli depend upon the work to be done, and he can best arrange his marches in consultation with your officers on the spot, with whom, I am sure, his relations will be^of the most cordial description. It only remains for me to say that Major McMahon is an officer who has great experience of the frontier, and in whose judgment I have implicit confidence; and that, if all parties co-operate to assist him in his task, I am hopeful that he may arrive at a decision which will ^ anc ^ * m P ar ti a ^ ail d which will be willingly accepted by the Governments of lour Highness and of His Majesty the Shah.ff Telegram, dated the 1st January 1908. From—The Secretary of State, London, To—The Viceroy, Camp Delhi. Seistan adjudication. Sir A. Hardinge’s telegram of 29th December. We do not think that Russian intervention can he allowed in any form, and we are of opinion that, if in spite off our remonstrances to the Shah a Russian delegate accompanies the Persian Commission, Major McMahon should decline to exercise his arbitral functions and keep on the Afghan side of the frontier as suggested by Sir Arthur Hardinge, and advise the Afghans. This will enable him to supply all necessary information; and if inconveniences result to Persian cultivators owing to interference of Afghans with water-supply, it will be due to the failure of the Persian Government to respect its treaty obligations. Please repeat to Tehran. Telegram No. 21-C,, dated the 2nd January 1903. From—The Viceroy, Camp Delhi, To—The Secretary of State, London. Your telegram of the 1st January. I understand that Sir A. Hardinge only recommends that Major McMahon should arrange to meet the Persian and Afghan Commissioners in Afghan territory. Your proposal goes further and implies that Major McMahon should in certain contingency remain altogether on the Afghan side of frontier. This is a serious proposal, for, if the Mission is to prove abortive owing to refusal of Persian Commissioner to enter Afghan territory, or if we fail to enter the tract in dispute, we are likely to forfeit the confidence of the Afghans. On the other hand, if Persia, backed by Russia, assumes a hostile attitude on the border owing to further tampering with river by Afghans, we might conceivably have another Panjdeh incident, or Major McMahon’s Mission might develope into a temporary occupation of Afghan-Seistan, the Russians simultaneously occupying Persian Seistan. ^ I think therefore that a determined effort should be made to hold Persia to its treaty position and to exclude Russians altogether from arbitration, even pro ceeding to threats of serious consequences if the Persian Government does not give way. This seems to be a test case between ourselves and Russia in Seistan, in wlpch right is fortunately entirely on our side.

From—S ir A. Hardin ge, Tehran, To—The Viceroy, Camp Delhi. Your Excellency’s telegrams of yesterday. I do not think that Major McMahon can remain altogether on the Afghan side but I expect that the Persians would be willing that the head-quarters of all three Missions should he there, if we told them that in this case only a portion of our escort need enter Persian Seistan. I hear that the Russian Minister yesterday bullied the Grand Vizier severely about arbitration and accused him of having a secret understanding with us. I should like to make His Highness’s position as easy for him as possible, and think that we should not at present use threats. He wants arbitration delayed, which, of course, we cannot agree to ; but suggestion that, so as not to alarm Shah, Major McMahon’s entire escort need not enter Persia, if the Persian Commissioner will meet him on Afghan side, might help him. Otherwise the Russians may threaten to send an equally strong force to Seistan as an escort to their Consul, should he proceed to the frontier on instructions from them. I agree about Major Douglas coming with the Mission, but in that case when will he reach Tehran ?

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 421, dated the 18th December 1902, addressed by me to Bis Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India for Khorasan and Seistan, in continuation of my telegram JSo. 406, dated 7th December, to your address. No. 421, dated Seistan, the ISth December 1902. From— Major ft. A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan and Kain, To — Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Whyte, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan and Seistan. I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 406 of 7th December to the Government of India, a copy of which was forwarded to you under this office endorsement No. 407 of the same date, regarding the recent arrival of Persian troops in Seistan. 2. The strength of the new troops according to information supplied to me by the Karguzar of Seistan and obtained from other sources, appears to be as under:— Arrived under Savhang Sayad Umr Shah on 19th October . • . . • • • Arrived about 20th November from Birjand (Kaini Infantry) . • • • * * Arrived on 4th December under Shuja-ul-Mulk (Karay Infantry) Arrived on 4th December under Shuja-ul-Mulk . . With Yamin-i-Nizam (for use of Customs) Cavalry. Infantry. sent in relief of the present indeed to obtaffi apy reliable total 1,020 men. 3. It is said that these troops have been Seistan garrison. It has been very difficult indeed ta obtam? information as to the actual present strength of the Mter) The mambers o-iven ran-e from 70 to 270, the reason being that many, since the arrival of the detachment here, have become engaged in trade and have left Nasratabad for the adjacent villages, many have deserted and many by^ sundry corrupt practices have managed to return to their homes. Such a thing as a register does not apparently exist. When the detachment arrived here about three (some informants say six) vears ago, the strength of the corps is said to have been 500 ; but all informants are agreed that half that number does not now exist. Since the despatch of my above-quoted telegram the Local Governor has made an attempt to comply with the orders sent to him to send the old Kaini detachment away from Seistan on the arrival of the new troops. I therefore sent Agents to the first village on the Seistan-Lirjand road, through which the troops would have to pass, to count the number leaving Seistan. These Agents now report that from 110 to 150 have passed through the village, in twos and threes, on their way to Birjand. It seems also that about 120 others, who are married men or engaged in trades, have been permitted to remain in Seistan until the spring. Having settled down here with their families to trades and other pursuits it is said to he unlikely that they will leave. 4. The presence of the newly-arrived Kaini Regiment (300 men) in Seistan as well as the 500 Karay Infantry is accounted for here in the follow ing way : The Kaini Infantry stationed in Seistan had been here for “ 6 years without being relieved. A petition was sent to Meshed or Tehran, with the result that the Governor of Birjand was ordered to send the Birjand Kami detachment to Seistan. But the men seem to have refused to move and theGovernor reported the fact. The Karay Regiment from Kelat-i-Nadiri was then ordered to proceed to Seistan in relief of the detachment there and the Birjand-Kaini Regiment was ordered to move to Kelat-i-Nadiri. The Governor of Birjand, fearing an enumeration of the corps which, he was aware, would not hear inspection, ignored these orders and despatched the Kaini Regiment from Birjand to Seistan, pretending that he had not received the Meshed orders to send them to Kelat and reporting that he had been able to persuade the men to go to Seistan. But by that time the Karay Regiment was already on its way here, and thus both the Kaini and Karay Infantry found themselves at the same moment in Seistan. As the Local Governor has refused to pay the new Kaini Infantry their pay, saying that they have come here without orders, it is probable that they will not stay. They have, it is said, represented their case to the Director of Customs who has told them to remain here until orders reach him on this subject from Meshed. 5 . The present strength of the troops now in Seistan stands, as far as it is possible to calculate, at 870 men as under:— Newly arrived (as per paragraph 2) . . . . .■ 1,020 men Dediwt —Men of old garrison left Seistan . . . . 150 This number, calculating the normal strength of the Seistan garrison at its paper strength, viz., 500, is 370 in excess of the number usually maintained here Calculating it at its actual strength, at the time of the arrival ol the new troops, viz., 270 (150 now left Seistan and 120 who may leave in the spring —vide paragraph 3 above) the excess comes to 600 men. 6 A copy of this letter has been sent to the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, and to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan.

Heavy rain fell here during the 2nd and 3rd December. The present tempoiaiy quarters of the Consulate, which we are still occupying^ suffered considerably and two rooms were rendered uninhabitable. ' In the city many of the domed roofs fell in and three Seistanis were killed. 4. The Helmund has risen considerably. The Karguzar informed me that half the Seistan Bund^ at Kohak had been carried away, and that the Afghan Bund at Shahgul, which has been one of the main causes of the recent water difficulty, has also been demolished. A bund, constructed by the Seistanis just above the Poozah Jang Jah channel, the existence of which had not been reported to me, was also carried away. The Miankangi district now has an ample supply of water and the villagers are reported to be busily engaged in cultivation. Prom Deh Dost Muhammad a report has reached me that the Kat Hhuda of that place, having made use of a water channel which takes off from the west bank of the (old) Helmund to irrigate his district, the Akhunzada blocked up the mouth of the channel, which, however, was opened again by the Kat Khuda. With the exception of this incident the status quo with respect to the Seistan water question has not been disturbed. It is, however, reported from a reliable source that the Akhunzada has completed the long canal he was engaged in digging from Kushk above the Seistan Bund to Jaroki. Three hundred and fifty labourers are said to have been discharged from work on the 4th December.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000365.0x000389_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/52</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x000389</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/52</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1880/1904 Pt 1 'Perso-Afghan Frontier: - Seistan Arbitration.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1903/1910</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-13T14:54:50</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (254 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 1880 (Perso-Afghan Frontier) consists of two volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/52-53.
