It is followed by 1B, and then by folio number 2. After folio number 3 the sequence jumps straight to number 5 – there is no number 4. The sequence then runs through to 120. Number 121 has been missed out, so folio number 120 is followed by number 122. The sequence then continues through to 381, which is the inside of the back cover of the volume. It should be noted that letters have been used to number folios at two other points in the sequence: 229 is followed by 229A; and 329 is followed by 329A. This sequence consists of small pencil numbers, in the top right corner of each folio.The second foliation sequence begins at the first letter, which is the third folio of writing and runs through to number 356, the last folio of writing.This foliation sequence is written in pencil (using slightly larger numbers), in the top right corner of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence relating to the mining of red oxide on Abu Musa island by a German company, Wonckhaus, and the British desire to prevent the Germans gaining a monopoly and presence on the island.
