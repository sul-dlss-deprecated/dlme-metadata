The file largely consists of the Agency's correspondence with various suppliers and distributors of vehicle parts in Bahrain.The file contains specific details of the vehicles used by the Agency during this time (the Agency appears to have had two vehicles for official use at any one time between 1946 and 1950). Vehicles used by the Agency during this period include a Vauxhall VXO, an Austin Station Wagon and a Humber Super Snipe Saloon.Also included in the file are the following: monthly statements regarding staff use of the Agency's vehicles, which provide details of trips (including the names of the members of staff on duty and the distances travelled) that may be credited to the Agency's transport fund (later referred to as the transport account); details of two accidents involving an Agency vehicle; Foreign Office guidance on the use of official transport; copies of reports on the condition of the Agency's vehicles.The principal correspondents in the file are the following: the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Government of Bahrain's State Engineer; Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited; A A Zayani and Sons (general merchants and commission agents, based in Bahrain); the Foreign Office's Conference and Supply Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bahrain, State Engineer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Conference and Supply Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>A A Zayani and Sons, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Cars</topic></subject><subject><topic>Car industry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016b#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
