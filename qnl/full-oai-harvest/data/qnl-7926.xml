The first, dated 31 December 1946, confirms the abolition of the mixed courts system and the second, dated 9 January 1947, lays out changes to the structure of the country's courts and judiciary.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Lebanon</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Decrees</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the United States of America</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Damascus</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Syria</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Mandates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Courts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
