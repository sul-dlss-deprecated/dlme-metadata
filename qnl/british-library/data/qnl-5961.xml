Sir, I am directed hy Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lioter to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India that in connection with the appli- -cation of the ’Iraq. Government for admission to the League of Nations, he has under consideration the question o t Iraq, including that Detween # Iraq and Koweit. 2. As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, the history of the frontier 'between *Iraq and Kuwait is as follows. The Koweit frontiers were laid down in the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of the 29th of ^uly,1913. This Agreement was never ratified, hut in 1923 the Sheikh of Koweit was informed that His Majesty*s Government recognised the frontier claimed hy him between Koweit and # Iraq. This frontier is indicated hy a green line on the map which formed annexe 5 to the Agree- -ment of 1913, and is also shown in green on Map 2 annexed to the Historical Summary of Events for the period 1907-1928 (P.G.13), which was prepared in 1928 for the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Committee * of Imperial Defence. Por convenience of reference the definition of the frontier claimed hy the Sheikh and recognised hy His Majesty's Government is set out in a note attached to this letter. In this connectr -ion, reference is invited to your letter No.P.2306 of the 20th of dune, 1923, and the connected corres- -pondence, and to your letter to the Foreign Office No. P.Z.5650/31 of the 26th of October, 1931. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.^* It is important that when applying for memhership ol the League of 1 Nations, the •Iraq G-overnment should he in a position to show that •Iraq possesses well defined frontiers with all oordering states* While it may he argued that this requirement is fulfilled in the oase of Koweit, it is thought advisable that the frontier should now he defined in a formal manner hy instruf -ments which would he suitable for production if necessary at (Geneva. « ^• After consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding the question of ’Iraq’s frontiers in general, Sir Philip Cun- -li..te-Lister considers that the best course would he for the existing frontier between ’Iraq and Koweit to he re-affirmed in an Exchange of Notes between the Iraqi (Government and the Sheikh of Koweit which in the case of Koweit should have the approval of His Majesty’s (Government. It is, of course, realised that the approval of His -i^-ajes- “ty s government in this case has no relevance in so far as the League of Rations is concerned, since Koweit does not come within the purview of that body. Nevertheless, Sir Samuel Koare will doubt- -less agree that since the foreign relations of Kowei b are under the control of His Majesty’s (Gov- -ernment it is important to avoid what might con- -stitute a precedent for independent action on the part of the Sheikh in the foreign affairs of his country. 5. It is,therefore,suggested that the settlement should take the form of an Exchange of Notes as follows:- (a) a note from the ’Iraqi Prime Minister to the Sheikh of Koweit putting forward the proposal for a re-affirmation of the existing frontier on behalfV 5. ■behalf of the Iraq. G-ovemment. (h) a letter from the Sheikh to the Political Agent at Koweit reporting the proposal and asking for the approval of His Majesty’s Government. (c) a letter from the Political Agent, to the Sheikh in reply to (h) conveying the approval of His Majesty’s Government. (d) a note from the Sheikh to the Iraqi Prime Minister taking note of and accepting the proposal in (a). -^Letters (h) and (c) would not he for puhlica- -tion except in caseiof necessity). It is 'propose -ed to follow a similar procedure, mutat is mutandis, in the case of the *Iraq-Trans-Jordan frontier. 6 . As it is very desirable that this question, together with the other outstanding questions affect- -ing ’Iraq’s frontiers should he settled before the September session of the Assembly of the League of Nations, Sir Philip Ounliffe-Lister would be glad to be informed as early as possible whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the procedure suggested in the proceeding paragraphs. If so steps will immed- -iately be taken to convey the necessary instructions to the High Gommissioner for ’Iraq and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It is not anticipated that any difficulty will be experienced in obtaining the 'Iraqi Government's consent to the proposed arrang- -ment. 7.

As regards para 5 of Colonial office letter Poliia. calConfidential• D.0.No # 79, Political Agency, Kuwait. Dated the 6th June 1932. My dear Jardine, Just a line to tell you about an incident which somewhat startled me, and has ratter upset the Shaikh. Near Safwan and as near as one can judge on the Kuwait side of the frontier line between Iraq and Kuwait my predecessor Colonel More on behalf of the Shaikh erected a large 'Notice Board'marked 'IRAQ-KUWAIT BOUNDARY' and warning motorists to keep to the right or left oeT the road whether they were going to Kuwait or Zubair as the case may be. You are of course aware that in Kuwait the rule of the road ivncKYnoxirk is the left. The board I understand from the Shaikh was originally erected in consultation with the Iraq authorities, and not only showed where the boundary line ran, but was a most useful help against accidents. On my way to Basrah on 2nd June, the board was standing as usual. But on my return I found it at the Police Post at Safwan Camp. On my asking who had removed it and why, the Chaoush (a negro) replied that he had received orders from the Polite Commandant at Basrah to take down the board and he had obeyed. He cculd not say why such order had been issued. As the board was erected at the Shaikh f s expense and served a useful purpose, it seems to me rather a tactless thing on someone’s part to say the least of it to have ordered its removal, without consulting us at this end. I am willing and so is the Shaikh to believe that a mistake has occurred or someone has been overzealous somewhere. Nevertheless I should be most obliged if you could find out from the Mutasarrif, whether he knew anything about the removal, and if not whether you could arrange for the board to be replaced in its old position. I quite admit that the writing on the board has been nearly obliterated by driving sand but we were about toto have this defect seen to Ever so many thanks for all your kindness to the family and myself.

After compliments, Regarding the removal by the ’Iraq Police of the ' notice hoard M marking the frontier between Kuwait and ’Iraq, a. As Your Excellency is aware 1 made strong representations to Mr. Jardine, the Administrative Inspector, Basrah, when I noticed that the board had been taken away on 4th June, and Mr. Jardine wrote and said the Police had taken it down by mistake, but would put it up again. 3 . I then wrote asking that if possible the board might be freshly repainted in Basrah as it was already down, and that if he, Mr. Jardine, sent the bill to Kuwait, I felt sure that Your Excellency would pay any costs that had been incurred. flfi i A 4. Mr. Jardine writes now in his letter Wo.156 dated 10th July and says that in spite of all his efforts with the Mutasarrif, that official has declined to have the board £ sent in to Basrah for repainting because of the expense. A translation of the Mutasarrif *s letter No.8287 dated 5th July to Mr. Jardine is forwarded with this for Your Excellency’s information. 9 Mr. Jardine asked me in his letter to explain to Your Excellency his great regret that the board was ever moved, his farther regret that the new Mutasarrif has so- 2 ungraciously refused to repaint the board, and his hope that you will understand that he for his part has done his best and that you will not think him to blame. 6. From the Mutasarrif’s letter it is clear that the board has now been replaced in its original state, and I would strongly urge that Your Excellency send a party of men to have it repainted at the first opportunity with the words.- '♦KUmiT FRONTIER” ”CaRS KEEP TO THE LEFT” repainted in English and nrabic on the side facing ’Iraq, i. e . on the North side. 7 0 I do not think it is necessary to paint anything on the Southern side of the board. There is, I believe, a man in Kuwait who is an expert at writing in English and Arabic. 8. lastly if the ’Iraq authorities see that Your Excellency is determined to keep the board painted and in good repair, they will not be tempted to move it in future.

Sir, In your despatch No *72 (17 6/2/34) of the 13th February, Your Excellency reported an enquiry made by the United States Embassy at Angora reyarding the Anglo Turkish Convention of the 29th July 1913. This enquiry may prove of considerable importance, since there is reason to believe that the interest which it reveals on the part of the United States Government in the question of boundaries in Eastern Arabia is in all probability connected with the activities of* United States Oil interests in that area* ixs you are no doubt, aware, in July 1933, the Standard Oil Company of California obtained from King Ibn Saud an Oil concession covering the Eastern part of his dominions. To the north the limits of this con cession are co-terrninous with the frontiers between Saudi Arabia, on the one hand and ’Iraq and the independent ^rab principality of Kuwait, on the other. These frontiers are now laid down in certain agreements referred to in paragraph 4 below, but the position in the south and south, east is, however less simple. 2. On the 29th July 1913, His Majesty’s Government concluded with the Ottoman Government a convention defining the south % eastern boundary of Turkish Arabia from the coast of the Persian Gulf as far as the twentieth parallel of latitude. A second Convention concluded on the 9th March 1914, continued the definition of this boundary between this point and the already delimited frontier between the Vilayet of the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate. Copies of the 19 13 Convention aa e enclosed in this despatch: the text of the 1914 Convention will be found on pages 42 and 43 oK the 1933 edition of volumecopy of which is, I understand in the library of His Majesty 1 s Embassy* The first of these Conventions w s never ratified but the boundary line laid down in Article 11 thereof was definitely adopted by Article 5 of the second Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on the 3rd ¥ June, 1914. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have not had occasion to discuss with King Ibn Laud, since he acquired independent sovereignty over Nejd and the Rasa Coast, the question of the precise boundary between his dominions and those of the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf, who are in special treaty rela tions with His Majesty’s Govern ment although Ibn Laud has, by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of the 20th May 1927 formally recognised those special relations and undertaken to maintain friendly relations with the rulers concerned. But the fact that certain territories on the Ottoman side of 1913/14 line have now become independent States, cannot be regarded in the view of His ffaje sty’s Government as in any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line, which were then and still remain under British inlfuence. His Majesty’s Government therefore still regard the 1913/14 line as forming the boundary between the Ottoman Succession State of Saudi Arabia and the territories of south eastern Arabia with which the}/ are in special relations. 3. Having regard to the presence of United States oil interests in this area it is important that the United States Government should be under no misanprehe nsi on on this point. H£ is i^lesirable therefore that th^r should receive as full an account as possible of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the matter without delay, and should not be left to obtain possibly misleading information from the Turkish or Saudi Arabian Governments. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will arrange, as soon as possible for the United States Embassy at nngora(a) to be furnished with a copy of the Anglo Turkish Convention of the 29th July 19 13, and (b) to be shown the text of the Anglo Turkish Convention of the 9th March 1914 (Aitchison, /l.^I 1933) pages 42 onwards). It should be pointed out to the United C3 United States Embassy that, while the 19 13 Conventiorjis unratified, the boundary laid doui in Article 11 is mentioned, adequately defined and definitely adopted in Article 3 of the ratified Convention of 1914, which in vi* the view of His llajesty's Government remains operative. further, since Article 7 of the 19 13 Convention contains provisions regarding the frontier of Kuwait, it would be well that the attention of the United States embassy should also be dram to (c) the Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention of the 2nd December, 1922 (Aitchison volume XI (1933 pages 213-4). Finally since in connection with the California Standard Oil Company^ conces sion it may be of interest to the United States Government to have the exact documentary definition of the T Iraq-Nejd frontier, the United States embassy should also be shorn the text of (d) Protocal No.l between T Iraq and Pejd, signed at Uqair on the 2nd December 1922. (Aitchison volume 1.1(1933) pages 211-2). 4. The United States Embassy may ve given copies of any of the above texts which they may require and should be informed that Aitchison’s 'Treaties* is purchasable, if they or the State Department should require a copy. 5. There is, however, one point arising out of the question of this frontier which needs special attention. i enclose, for your own confidential information and guidance, copies of telegraphic correspondence between the India Office and the Government of India from which you will see that, although Pis Majesty’s Government are satisfied as to the legal validity of the 1913/14 frontier as marking the eastern boundary on Ibn Gaud’s dominions, some difficulty may possibly arise IbH-Saud- ! - 6 -deMinieHS 7 -' 8 © in maintaining that theterritory im mediately to the east of that line still forms part oi the dominions of the Shaikh of Qatar. This point is receiving further consideration; and meanwhile, should you find it necessary to give tie United States Embassy any oral explanati ons on the matter, you should notwithstanding the fact that the 1913 convention specifically describes the blue line as oi'icing Pejd from' the territory 'of Qatar” avoid referring to the 1 I Sir to theto the territory to the east of the blue line as specifically forming part of the otate of Qatar itself, but refer to it merely as being under British influence. 6.

KUWAIT. Kuwait was founded about the beginning of the eighteenth century by settlers of the Utub, over whom the Subah family enjoyed predominance, and grew rapidly in the first fifty years of its existence. The recorded history of British relations with Kuwait opens in 1775, when, on the investment of Basra by the Persians / the British desert mail from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo was first despatched from Kuwait, an arrangement which continued until 1779. In 1805 the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Zubarah asked the Britis] Government to guarantee than a safe retreat in Bahrain, in the event of their severing their connection '?ith the Wahhabis, who, they said, might otherwise force than to engage in de predations on British trade. Their proposals were not enter tained. ' In 1809 an offer by the Shaikh of Kuwait to join the British expedition against Bas-al-Khaimah with his fleet was refused. In December 1821, on account of difficulties with the Turkish authorities, the British Residency at Basra was tempo rarily removed to an island in Kuwait territory. In 1841 Shaikh Subah bin Jabir, on behalf of his father, signed an undertaking to adhere to the Maritime Truce for a period of one year. In May 1896 Shaikh Mubarak became ruler of Kuwait. At first the attitude of the Turks towards him was one of neutrality, but in 1897 they appointed him Qaim-maqam of Kuwait. In February 1897 the Turks sent a quarantine official to Kuwait, and In the same month the Shaikh asked for an interview with the Political Resident or an agent deputed by him/I him. The iissistsnti to 'th© i^osid.Gii't ©V6n. , t'u©lXy ©i*Pi'v©d. in Kuwait in September, and the Shaikh intimated that he and his people would like to cane under British protection to avoid annexation by the Turks. He repeated his request a year later. Her Majesty’s Crovermnent did not, however, accede to his request. In Januaiy 1899 the Shaikh signed an Agreement (No.XXXVI) binding him and his succeecors not to alienate any part of his Her Majesty’s Government undertook, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the Agreement, to support them and accord than their good offices. In May 1899 Shaikh Mubarak ©stabilised regular customs at ■ Kuwait, and began to realise an enhanced duty of five per cent on all imports, including those from Turkish ports. In September a Turkish harbourmaster with five soldiers arrived to tal© charge of the port but had to retum to Basra, as the Shaikh would not receive him. I In May 1900 Shaikh Mubarak agreed (Ko.XXXVII) to prohibit; ^ _ the importation of arms Into Kuwait, and their exportation therefrom, and issued notifications to that effect, and to the effect thet vessels suspected of carrying arms were liable to be searched, anti!, all arms found confiscated. In the summer of 1900 the series of events began which led eventually to the restoration of the Wahhabi dynasty in Nejd. : Before that was brought about, however, Shaikh Mubarak led a remarkable Incursion in their interests into the very heart of Central Arabia. A severe engagement took place at Sarif, near Buraidah, which, though attended by seriousness of the situation was soon brought home to him. Accordingly he approached the Political Resident through the Comnander of H.M.S.SPHIHX with a request that the British Government would territory without the consent of the British. Government: and His request was, however, rejected. assume a permanent protectorate over Kuwait In December 4901 the Turkish sloop of w / at Kuwait and delivered an ultimatum to the Shaikh, requiring' - 3 - requiring him either to receive a Turkic military detachment at Kuwait or to leave Kuwait and retire to Constantinople. The Shaikh gave a politic but negative reply and the ZUHAF withdrew. Towards the end of the same month iihore was reason to think that a land attack on Kuwait was contemplated by a combined force of Turks and Bin Rashid’s followers. Dis positions were immediately made by the British naval force to cooperate in the defence of the town. This deterred Bin Rashid, who withdrew to his own part of the desert. The most dangerous direct attack to which Mubarak had been exposed was arranged for the autumn of 1902 by Yusuf bin Abdulli of Dorah: its object was to seize Kuwait by a coup de main. A large body of Sharifat Arabs frem the Persian side, under the Shaikh’s nephew, embarked at Dorah on the Shatt-al-Arab 1 The Commander of H.M.S.Lapwing received news of the expedition on the 3rd Septaaber at Fao, and immediately hastened to Kuwait to give the alarm, but found the tom already under arms. Search for the enemy was made, at first without success, but on the 5th they were di scovered. Two boats containing a hundred and fifty riflemen were pursued by the armed boats of the Lapwing. After a sharp figfat in the boats and their contents, including scaling ladders, were captured. The visit paid by the Viceroy (Lord Curson) in November 1903 marked the eonsolidation of British influence in Kuwait, and placed in a clear light the Shaikh’s cardial relations with the British Government. In 1904 tie Shaikh agreed (No.XXXVIII) not to allow the establishment of a post office by any other Ooveminent. The appointment of a British Political Agent to Kuwait was authorised in Junel904, and the first incumbent of the post arrived in August, In 1907 the Shaikh agreed to lease in perpetuity to the ^ British Government a plot of land to the south of Bandar Shuwaikh for Rs.60,000 perannum, leaving to them the right to relinquish the least at any time should they wish to do so. At the/ ' • \ V? \ ■ ' v V . #.2 / •* 4r «•» At the same time the British Government assured Shaikh Mubarak that they recognised tRaat the town of Kuwait and its boundaries belonged to him and to his heirs after him: that all his arrangements, including customs arrangements, would remain in his hands and in those of his heirs after him: and that the British Government would collect no customs duties in the Bandar Shuwaikh lands or in any other lands that they might there after lease from him or his heirs after him. The Bandar Shuwaik Shuwaikh lease was relinquished Jn 1922. In 1911 shaikh Mubarak gave an under talking (No. XXX IX) not to respond, without consulting the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to overtures for pearling concessions and sponge fishing in respect of the banks over v/hich he possessed rights. In 1912 Shaikh Mubarak gave a written undertaking (No. XLI) not to permit the exploitation of Oil in his territories by any one except a parson recommended by the British Govern ment. The outbreak of the Great War excited little interest in Kuwait until the entry of Turkey into the Var, which aroused some sympathy with her. This, however, did not last and in return for Shaikh Mubarak f s unswerving loyalty and offer of cooperation during the War, the British Government guaranteed him against all consequences of his attack on Safwan, Umm Qasr and Bublyan, and assured him that his date gardens between Fao and Qumah would remain in the possession of himself and his heirs and be immune from taxation for ever and that Kuwait would be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. (No.XLII)* It had been agreed in 1913 theft an Indian Post Office should be established at Kuwait on the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, and an. Office was in fact opened under the orders of the Government of India at the beginning of 1915. In February 1915 the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge, visited Kuwait. IllShaikh Mubarak died in November 191b and was succeeded by his eldest son Jabir , to whom the Viceroy sent a letter congratulating him on his succession, and assured him that, so long as he acted up to existing arrangements with the British Government, he mi$it expect the same support as had been enjoyed by his father* Shaikh Jabir died in February 1917 and was succeeded by his brother Salim, to whom the assurancesgiven to his predecessor were renewed. In February 1918 it was found necessary to enforce a blockade of Kuwait, which lasted until the conclusion of the armistice with Turkey, and in July the Shaikh was warned that the assurances given to him and to his father, and the friendship, protection and assist: nee of the British Govern ment enjoyed by his father, would be continued only on the condition that he should be personally responsible for, and prevent, all acts in his territory whether committed by his own subjects or by other persons, which might be ag: inst the interests of the British Government. The latter part of Galim 1 s reign was marked by increasing ly strained rela-cions between him and Bin Gaud. In 1920 difficulties in connection with the question of customs and transit dues in Kuwait induced Bin Gaud to place an &lt;a:abargo on trade with Kuwait, as the result of which the prosperity of the principality has been seriously affected. There has been no development of ^ importance in recent years but the position remains unsatisfactory. Shaikh Salim died 4 in February 1921 and was succeeded, in March by his nephew the present Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir who, at the time of his uncle’s death, was absent in i.ajd on a mission to try and Improve the relations between Nejd and Kuwait. The assurances, given to his predecessors, were renewed to him. At a conference, held at Uqair at the end of between the Hir^h Commissioner for ’Iraq and Bin Gaud, at- 6 ~ at which the Political Agent, Kuwait, was also present, the question of the frontier between Kuwait and Nejd came up for diecussion. 7 The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Kuwait was demarcated f see No.IV), and also a tract of country in which it Has agreed that the Rulers of Nejd and Kuwait should enjoy equal rights. In April 19 23 the Shaikh of Kuwait was informed (No. XLIII) through* the Political Agent thst His Majesty’s (rovommant recognised the T Iraq~Kuwait frontiers claimed by him. In May 1924 the Sultan of Nejd and the Shaikh of Kuwait jointly granted an oil concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, of London, in respect the neutral zone between the t wo principalities. As the Syndicate has not complied with its obligations to ccnraence and carry on operations, the concession is subject to cancellation and forfeiture, if not actually null and void. In October 1925 an Order in Council came into effect providing for British jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners within the principality of Kuwait. The frontier troubles between ’Iraq and Nejd and the rebellion in 1929 of the Ajraen end I/utair tribes against Bln Baud (see 1, The Wahhabis end Nejd), have pieced the Shaikh of Kuwait in a difficult position.(Trkan from Ait oh is on* Vol.XI. 5th Edition, s 'Treaties, iigagements, 1929 - see pp.213,214} and Sanads Ko. 17 0 rr r IT-NAXD BOTITTDAHT C O^/EHTT ON, ^ 1922.

India Office telegrem to Government of India No# 958 • I am increasingly disturbed at possiblity of two separate conflicts with Ibn Saud over Kuwait and area east of Blue Line. See paragraph 4 of my telegram No.40. Atmosphere may now be clouded by latest row induced by incident and no question can be considered without taking account of Saudi-Yemsn situation which may be developing more rapidly than seemed likely three weeks ago. If Ibn Saud wins in conflict with Imam in which His Majesty's Government lias done nothing material to help him he will be encouraged to resist our claims in eastern Arabia. He may be all the readier to do so thou^i this is conjecture as a result of establishment of direct contact with Arab leaders taking part in mission of mediation now here. If he is worsted by Imam he will think His Majesty's Govern ment are taking advantage of his difficulties to embark on forward policy on eastern side of his dominions. I realise that policy in regard to question mentioned in first sentence cannot be altered. It occurred to me however that appearance of double attack on Ibn caud mi^bt be mitigated by a preliminary communication on the following lines if Shaikh of Kuwait abandons his pecuniary claims: • F , e . IvUL I t ., ShaikhShaikh of Kuwait has waived claim and. His Majesty’s Government intend to pursue actively question of Kuwait blockade settlement of which is imperative* Course of correspondence regarding claims has revealed dangerous misunderstandings as a result of direct correspondence between Shaikh and Ibn aud. In view of their special relations with Kuwait nature of which was explained to Saudi Government in 1927 , His Majesty’s Government consider matter affecting official relations between Ibn Saud and Shaikh should be conducted throu^i their intermediary* This applies also to neutral zone regarding which Sadui Government have recently consulted His Majesty’s Government but only after intimating ? theme very considerably to certain parties on a matter (Oil) which equally concerns Shaikh and therefore His Majesty’s Government, Latter have also had reasons for perturbation as regards relations between Ibn Saud and one cf the rulers of (Qatar) ed in same articles of Treaty of Jedda. They wish to remind Saudi Government that their interests in these matters depends on specific treaties with them and on fact that their territories within British sphere of influence as defined by Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 and 1914 which determined eastern boundaries of ^ejd as His Majesty’s Government have recently had occasion to to united States Government in reply to an enquiry* I submit this suggestion with diffidence* It it C were possible to adopt it I suggest communication in form of memorandum from His Majesty’s Govemmait. As such it would pave the way for action Kuwait blockade question on whatever line you contemplate. As regards neat : al / one it would be established position that Ibn Saud cannot expect Hie Majesty’s Government merely to bring, Shaikh into line with his own premature arrangements with prospective? As regards Qatar it would produce concessionaries*3 - would produce effect intermediate between that of alternative | (b) and (c).

Nor can necessary preliminary understanding with Shaikh regarding direct correspondence with Ibn Saud be reached immediately* Question of Oil concession in Neutral Zone is at present being amicably treated by Ibn Saud not involve acrimonious discussion at present stage. On the other hand question of his Eastern boundary will have to be broached as soon as instructions reach you more especially since information regarding attitude of His Majesty’s Government may at any time reach hiia through American channels. These questions will therefore not be raised with Saudi Governmmt simultaneously and consequently need for such a communication as you suggest, which it would in fact be impossible tomake for some considerable time, does not appear to arise. -SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS-' Jk By Air Mail p.z.r? / ?^»yx / Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office c ii!

Mr. Skinner was most grateful for the communication which you had authorized me to make to him. He told me that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the unratified Convention of 1913 from the Turkish Govern ment, who had searched their archives for it in v in, and said that His Majesty’s Government should realize that matters of private interest, not of State interest were behind the inquiries which his Embassy had under taken, the interest residing in the concession of an important Petroleum Company. 2, It was obvious that my colleague knew nothing about the geography of the region in question. I emphasized the point that what I was showing him was the south eastern frontier line of Turkish Arabia. His Excellency put no question about what was happening east of that line, so I did not refer to El Qatar. He/ ight Honourable r John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc,,He did enquire why the Ottoman Goyernment had not ratified the 1913 Convention, and on this point I was unable to enlighten him. I said, however, that as the 1914 Convention confirmed the frontier in question, and indeed also prolonged it further southwards to the previously delimited frontier between the Aden Protec torate and the Yilayet of the Yemen, and as that Conven tion had been ratified, the non-ratification of the earlier Convention was hardly relevant to the matter in hand. 3 . I handed to Mr. Shinner, for retention, the copy of the 1913 Convention enclosed in your despatch, and lent him volume XI of Aitcheson’s 'Treaties”, a further copy of which he said he v^ould purchase for the use of his Embassy. 4.

'Then you were here with Edmonds recently, you tolc me that you had noticed as you were flying down to Kuwait, that there was a small island north of Jarba Island and asked me if I could say whether it was in Kuwait or Iraq territory. At the time I replied that I knew of no such island but suggested that if it was on the north side of War ha, it would probably belong to Iraq. 2. Since my remarks I have discovered an excellent chart of the southern end of the Khor Zubair and its junction with the Khor Abdulla and Khor Subiyeh, compiled by H.M.S.SPHIKX, Commander J.W.Kenp, R.N. in 1^0/and giving soundings etc. 3. I am enclosing a tracing of that portion of the chart, which is relevant to our talk* 4. You will notice that there is (a) a long narrow island just inside the Khor ubair and north-west of #arba Island, also (b) another small raind island just south of the south-western corner of Warba. 5. From the official definition of the Euwait-Iraq frontier line at this point, I think that it is pretty clear that (a) appertains to Iraq and (b) to Kuwait. 6. The frontier line dividing Kuwait and Iraq States runs, as you doubtless know f as follows; according to the text books on the subject: From the/ Lt.-Colonel J.C.Ward,C.M,G.,C,I.E.,D.S.O*, etc., Port Director, CONFIDlNTIiiL &amp; PERSONAL.From the intersection of the ,r acli al Auja with the Batin (just north of Riga!}, and thence north wards along the Batin (centre line) to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence it runs eastwards, passing immediately south of Jebel Sanam, Safwan wells aid Urn Qasr, leaving them to Iraq, and so on to the junction of the IQior Aubair with the Khor Abdulla, The boundary then proceeds down the the Khor Abdulla (centre line) leax’lng Warba and Bubiyan Islands to Kuwait* The islands of Maskan, Falaika, Auha, Kubbar, Qarw and Um al Maradln lying to the south of Bubiyan also appertain to Kuwait. 7* On the tracing which I send you I have marked in red, the frontier line as I understand it. 8.

Dated 10th (received 11th) July 1934. Your telegram 157. You may certainly express warm gratification with which His Majesty’s Government have learnt of comprehensive settlement reached with Imam. 2. If King Ibn Saud broaches question of general relations with His Majesty^ Government you should make it clear to him that His Majesty’s Government are animated, as in the past, by the most friendly feelings towards him. While he will understand that it is contrary to the policy of His Majesty’s Government to enter in alliance save in exceptional cases, such as the Iraq treaty, which takes the place of previous existing obligations, he may be assured that short of this His Majesty’s Government would welcome a strengthening of ties of friendship between the two Governments and are always ready for general conversations on outstanding questions with this object in view. Such general conversations would naturally include discussions in a friendly spirit of the two major questions, vis: 1. The 1913-14 Line and 2. Blockade of Kuwait, which requires settle ment but relations between Saudi Government and his Majesty’s Government can be considered entirely smooth and satisfactory. 3. As regards 1 you may inform Ibn Saud that if he will cease to contest the undoubted validity in international2 international law of the 1913-14 Line His Majesty’s Government will be prepared, as in the earlier case of Kuwait, to consider sympathetically and to authorise you to discuss on your return any reasonable proposal for minor adjustments. You might suggest that now that his achievements have brought his country into the circle of fully independent and properly constituted States he cannot merely seek to set aside generally accepted principles of international law which govern relations bet ween such States. It would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to discuss the boundary question on any other basis. 4. As regards 2 you should merely indicate that the obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Shaikh make it impossible to consider their relations with Ibn Saud as entirely satisfactory until some method is found of alleviating the damaging effects of the blockade upon the Sheikhdom. Should the King raise the question of the Shaikh's claims (regarding which position has not yet been cleared up with Shaikh) you may say that His Majesty’s Government agree that this matter must be settled also. 5. His Majesty’s Government will be glad to consider any proposals on these two points which His Majesty can communicate to them while you are on leave in order that on your teturn to Jedda you may be in possession of full instructions to enable you to discuss settlement of both. 6. As regards desiderata of Ibn Saud, since they are uncertain you can only take note of them for report to me. But if, as seems likely, his main desire is for some tightening of ties of friendship, while you should bear in mind the caution prescribed in my telegram No.18, you may act on the assumption that if individual questions of importance can be satisfactorily settled His Majesty’s Government would be ready to subscribe to formula expressing special degree of close friendship with Saudi Government short of alliance. 7. I leave you to adapt and make the best use you c r nyou can of the above material in the circumstances of the moment• 8. As regards other possible points. I have no further instructions to give you regarding the Neutral Zone Oil to gam time for the Iraq Petroleum Company pending completion of the Kuwait Oil Company’s negotiations, see my telegram No.122, and since neither the Standard Oil Company of California nor the Syndicate have yet come to terms with the oaudi Government no step appears necessary upon our side. 9. ns regards the Hejaz reservation see my telegram No.123.

Dated the 15th (received the 16th)July 1934. Your telegram No.127. Arrangements made under King direct for my visit to Taif show importance which he attached to it as an event of considerable importance and as an opportunity of affirming special nature of his relations with His Majesty’s Government He excelled himself in personal courtesy andattention as he expressed definite hope of receiving me in Riyadh; possibly next winter. I had three business audiences on J Kind welcomed congratulations of His Majesty’ uly 13th. s Government on Saudi-Yemen settlement and their assurances regarding their attitude towards him which I described as one of unchanged friendship. I explained that settlement of certain out standing questions would remove clouds and thereby enable the friendship to be still closer. Kin! developed theoretical danger to Iraq and consequential danger to Saudi Arabia from Persian or Turkish hostility. 'Then I sought elucidation what he finally suggested (?was) that this country and Iraq sho^V conclude some sort of defensive alliance under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government and that each should give formal undertaking to His Majesty’s Government not to stand against them or to support any Power which might do so. Discussion of 1913-14 Line was (omission) and to me embarrassing as I personally consider Ibn Baud’s case to be strong on certain points. I could not in any case without giving grave offence use argument that his admission to a family of independent and properly constituted States is a reason for his accepting undoubted validity of British legal thesis as against that stated in last note of Saudi Government2 I emphasized confidence of His Majesty’s Government in their view and difficulty they would have to in pursuing matter on any other basis but intimation of readiness on theirpart to consider minor modifications of Line if basis were accepted. King vehemently repudiated suggestion that Turks had any locus standi to alienate his own ancestral rights and used various subsidiary arguments which I will report on arrival in London. I suggested that question be postponed until then Ling expressed desire for settlement of Kuwait blockade question on terms of reciprocal advantage. He said cost of maintaining his own Customs posts would be greater than return irom their success seemed to favour discussion of whole (mut.) between Saudi Government and Kuwait representatives. As I am not sure whether Shaikh would now welcome this I did not report it by telegraph (mut.) but promised to report. King did not take up a passing reference of mine to question of Shaikh’s claims. Arising out of Kuwait question King mentioned what he called restrictions on trade of Nejd. I found that he was referring to Ahmedi incident and to alleged attitude of His Majesty's Government or Bahrain Government in prever ting ships frcm going to his own ports. He clearly did not understand all the issues and principal feature^ of his attitude was extreme bitterness of his personal feeling at what he represented as attempt to boycott development of Saudi ports. I tried to soothe him and promised Yusuf Yasin afterwards to go into whole question of direct shipments to Saudi ports in London. No other questions were discussed. King said that Fuad would be authorised to discuss matters when in London. This removes doubt as to whether he is still prepared to eu use Fuad but not as to whether Fuad is prepared to be used. I will prepare full report on whole position on my way. -Ryan-(Received from India Office under P.L.No.P.Z No*6295/34, dated 12.10.34). COPY. India Office, Whitehall, S.'/.l. 10th October ’ 34 . P.Z.6295/34. A,, / r Hy dear George, I write with further^eference to my letter to you of 24th May last, P.Z.3300/34, about the err r in the description of the western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone, to which attention was drawn in Dickson’s report of 12th April 19 34, No.9^56, to the Political Resident. , ' 2. le have no*/obtained the original Arabic text of the Convention from the Colonial Office and it has been examined by our Arabic experts here. Ijenclose a copy of a note by the Assistant Librarian, of my letter to Dickson and of Dickson’s reply. The Assistant Librarian informs me that Dickson’s surges :ion that the word ”bal’’ is more probably a mistake for the word tf jal f ’ is unlikely to be correct, and that it is most improbable that a local or colloquial word such as ”jal” would be used i the Arabic version of the treaty document, which is written in the clas. ical language. On the other hand, it appears that the Assistant Librarian’s own suggestion that the error may be the employment of ”dal” for ”til” is, ^or the reasons given by Dickson, equally untenable. 3. r ’he true explanation is probably that given in paragraph 8 of Dickson’s letter of 1st October, but I doubt whether v/e are likely profitably t o be able to pursue the matter much further at this stage. As the error is in the text and not in the translation it could not be modified without discussion r ith the Saudis, ’which might be difficult; thanks to the correspondence we are now on our guard as to the possibility of* any encroachment on the Neutral Zone by Ibn aud such as is referred to in paragraph 7 of Dickson’s letter of 1st October; and weand we shall know where we stand if formal discussion of the amend ment of the , re ' Text proves necessary at a later date. ould you let me know if you agree? 4.

''ours Bver, GILBMR 1 LiilfM'/Al AC.Thitehall, S.7.I. 27th September 1934. I.!y dear Di ckson , You will remember raising so me ti r e ago the Question of the error in the description in the Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1922 of the western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone as 'a low mountainous ridge called Shaq (111 Shaqq)'. Ye have since obtained the original Arabic text of the Convention and have had it examined by the Assistant Librar&gt;/ian here. He states that as it stands the rab word used (dal) can only mean ’’a low mountain range” and that this is an unlikely description is shown by the fact that the proper name given to it (HI IAha a q) literally means 'gap' or ”trench”. 'e adds, however: 'If I may be permitted to suggest an emendation in the Arabic tekt I think it is highly probable that 'dal' is a mistake ^or 'til”, ^his latter word bears the meaning ’a depressed piece of ground having in it a hill from which it is nossible to see all round’. This would fit in with the description given in Lt.-Col.Dickson’s letter, provided there is a hill (not necessarily a high one ' in the neighbourhood”. Perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know whether in fact there is a hill in the neighbourhood wrick would su 'port the Assistant Librarian’s suggestion. In any event, as it now proves that the error is in the text and iio u in the translation, it would, I think, be difficult to modify it, but it is perhaps unlikely to be of very mateiial importance, if I am correct in assuming th- t the Bhaq is a well-known natural feature about .the nature of which no one with any knowledge of the neighbourhood could have doubt. If this is so, we might do better to let the natter drop for the present, but be prepared with the Assistant Lib rarian’s emendation of the ^rabic text if any difficulty Yours ever, Sd.Gilbert Lai't^ aite * should arise in the future?-s it stands, the word ‘ r dal ?T can only mean fT a low mountainous range'; and that this is a very unlikely description of the feature is shown by the fact that the proper name given to it, (al-Shaqq or Dsh-Shakk), literally means 'gap' or 'trench'. But if I may be permitted to suggest an emendation in the ..rcbic text, I think that it is hight probable that 'dal' is a mistake for 'til' this latter word bears the meaning 'adepre? sed piece o' ground, havina in it a hill from which it is possible to see all round'. This would °it in 1th the description given in Lt.-Col. Dickson’s letter, provided there is a hill (not necessarily a high one) in the neighbourhood. fid. jv.J.Arberry.P.Z.6156/54. 57, Queen’s Gate October 1st 1954. P.O. My dear Laithwaite, / 1 /ill you kindly refer to your note to me of £7th September 1954, regarding the question of the e ror in the description in the Kuwait eutral lone Convention of 19 2°, of the Western Boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. Hth all due deference to the Assistant Librarian I do not think that the Arabic word 'dal” is a mistake for 'til', which he describes as meaning 'a depressed piece of ground having in it a hill from which it is possible to see all round'. It is much more likely, in my view, to be a mistake for the commonly used Bedouin word 'jal', which is used extensively in Nejd, Hassa, and Kuwait for a long low ridge, (for example, Jal al Liyah, Jal al Zor, which are to be found north of the Bay of Kuwait and on the road to Basra from Jahara), 3. '’he word 'til' or 'tel' undoubtedly means a small hill, usually of conical shape, in Arabic, but although it is extensively used in Palestine, Syria and Iraq is certainly not used in Kuwait or Nejd, as far as I know. There the commonly accepted word to denote such a feature as a small hillock, cone shaped, is 'thalaat' or 'thalaiyat' its diminutive, (examples Thal&amp;at al Dhaba, Thalaiat as Sur, both well known hills s.w. of K wait and west of the Neutral Zone respectively). small peak rising out of a ridge (example Idairat al Hussin, Idairat al Hamdth), but I do not think we need bother our heads about this latter. whole host of terms are used for natural features such as dry water courses, hills, depressions, flat open spaces without vegetation, pebbly ground, rocky ground, etc. etc. which are either not found in dictionaries, or The Bedouin also use the term 'Idairat' for a 4. One thing is pretty certain, In Becouin Arabic adictionaries, or ’-ave been so mutilated as not to be recognizable with their counterpart in the dictionary. A man like 'hilby who is an Arabic scholar could probably say how and from what classical Arabic word these Bedouin expressions have been arrived at, but I am afraid my knowledge does not ro as far* rn ° return t0 our subject. As the Arabic text says that the Western Boundary of the Neutral Zone is a low mountainous ridge called Shaq (al Shaqq)”, there clearly is an erro- somewhere, for as I explained present ly to you, the Shaq is a wide shall©?/ depression anything from 2 to 5 miles across according to location, with not a vestige of a hill or rise in its bed, throughout its ^ ole length - indeed it is so shallov/ throughout most of its length that in many parts of it the untrained eye cannot detect where the 'estem side begins and ends. o• io true that a series of low ridges and isolated hillocks run down the Eastern side of the Shaqq as far as the ITeutral Zone is concerned (as per sketch below) but as these lie generally speaking anything from 4 to 5 miles away, and as they bear other names such as Vebel Buwaris', 'Arhaiya”, etc., etc., one cannot claim that they have anything to do with the 'Chaq' depression proper. 7 * ' ne thing is quite clear to us in Kuwait, from the Shaikh downwards - the centre line of the 'Shaq' is understood to be the western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral 'one, and I believe Bin Saud and his people recog nize this also, and the only reason why I originally drew the Political Resident T s attention to the curious mistake in the text of the Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1S22 was that, as it stood, it offered an opportunity to in Saud of possibly some day attempting to encroach on the Neutral Zone from the west by laying claim to the strip of country lying between the Bastem edge of the Shac? and the series of low ridges lying 4 to 5 miles to the East of it. Such clai : would appeal greatly to the Nejdi mind.r:: ' # Ps^sonally think the mistake originally was due to the fact that Englishmen or an Englishman (probably Colonel .ore) drafted the original Boundary Convention in -^nglish, without having anv personal knowledge of the ground, and guided by the million sheet map of Arabia only, and it was then translated into Arabic for the approve:! and signature of the negotiators of the Convention. It would be quite easy for a person not know ing the ground and looking at the map to think that the Shaq was a low hill. In fact I have known more than three Englishmen who have made the same mistake ' T hen reading the map. Ehe latter is by no means as clear as it ought to be. 9. Apologising for this lengthy note, v ours sincerely, H.R.P.DICKSON.y Note on Bin Baud *3 attitude at the ^Oofelr^ meeting with ^ir Percy Cox In Noven^ber 1922 with npecial regard to the question of what he conbidered the best form of boundary between Iraq and i.ejKU As ordered by you I beg to submit the following note which I give from my memory. 2. I was sent down to Bahrain in September 1922 from Baghdad with special instructions from the High Commissioner to gat into touch with Bin Baud and persuade him to come down to the coast, with a view to hie meeting the High Commissioner. The special point for discussion and if possible for settlement was to be the Iraq-Hejd Boundary. 3* During the previous Spring a series of raids by Hejd tribes into Iraq territory, and an equal number of counter raids by £hanmar sections, who had not accepted Bin Baud’s overlordship, and had taken refuge in the Filla Liwa had brought the need for some sort of 'Modus rtrmDl* to the fore. 4. The first raid, counter raids, and subsequent political anti Bin Baud propaganda in Iraq were almost identic al in form and method to those which we later saw in the Autumn and Vinter of 1927-1928. 5. Few people realized, I think, especially certain British and Arab officials in Iraq that the trouble was almost entirely an 'economic' one. It was aggravated of course, by the unfortunate personal hostility which existed between King Faisal and Bin Baud. 6. It is a well known fact that the Northern and North-Hastem Bedouin tribes of Hejd and specially the Ajraan, Harb, Mutair, Sham iar t Awazim and nearer Iraq and Dhafir, cannot support themselves in their own country and must, of a necessity, as they have done for hundreds of years, migrate each year during the Autumn months towards the Euphrates and Kuwait in order to obtain certain necessities10./ of life* These come under three main heads: (a) Dates (b) Hice (c) Grazing for their camels at the end of the hot weather along the rich Zone lying to the outh of the Euphrates from Karbala to the Persian Gulf. 7. The above also applies to the 'astern 'Anaze' tribe in the North, but because of the fact that certain of their e X Shaikhs own land round Eerbala they came under the category of Iraq subjects and so need not be discussed here. 8. The routes and tribal sectors of the Euphrates tapped by the Shammer, Ajman, Harb, Mutair, Awazim and Dhafir etc., in their annual marketing migration have been from time immemorial approximately as follows:- i (1) Sharamar moved up towards Shinafiy&amp;h (near Nejf) and Samawah. (2) The Harb ditto. (2) The Dhafir towards Nasriyah and Suq esh Shuyusk. (4) Mutair towards Kuwait (5) The Ajman towards Kuwait and Zubair. (6) The Awazim towards Kuwait. 9. The methods adopted have always been the same. The Bedouin first sent presents in to the powerful Hiverain tribes (to the Muntafiq Saadun Shaikhs when the latter were strong) and asked permission to come up and camp near the river (usually this was about 20 miles away) where well water was good. From these camps they would 'Sabil* in one continuous stream up to the towns and tribal villager* along ’tluphrates to make their purchases. Permission was never refused as both sides benefitted. The Desert man brought money and camels while his Euphrates counterpart got rid of his surplus dates, barley and rice, and incidentally renewed his supplies of rifles and ammunition.*• 3 «* 10# ^or the river tribes to have denied to the Bedouin, persiission to pass upto the Euphrates for their 'Musabila” would have been tantamount to a declaration of war and trouble would have resulted. But this rarely happened and only if great heads of States, like the Amirs of Hail, the Bauds, the asdun Shaikhs of the Muntafiq ©to* were at enmity, as they sometimes were in the old days. 11* The point always to remember is that th© Euphrates towns and tribes {I include Kuwait also) always welcomed the annual migration, while the Hejd Bedouin have always looked upon Iraq and Kuwait as their natural shopping centres at the end of Summer and beginning of Winter, when grazing is scarce in their homeland and a distant move becomes imperative. 12. In my opinion a serious error was made at Ojair in 1922 when an arbitrary boundary of ©stern type was decided on between Iraq and Hejd, which resulted ultimately in Bin Saud for the first time in History almost^restricting the annual natural movements of ,N@jd tribes towards the North, A much better, in feet th© only solution to my mind, apart from a continuous line of Neutral Zone, would have been to have adopted what we know as a tribal boundary; that is to say so many whole tribes going to Nejd and so many others to Iraq and Kuwait right along the proposed frontier line fran. the Persian Gulf to Transjordan. 13. I mention th© above as at the Ojair onference mentioned at the beginning of this note, Bin Baud himself fought very hard indeed for a solution on these lines, anc I myself had bitter experience as Political Officer, Muntaflk, of the futility of the old Turkish arbitrary boundaries between LIWAS and only found relief from inter-LIWA tribal fighting when I was able to persuade Sir Percy Cox to allow me to adopt tribal boundaries. 14./- 4 - ir^ ■ Mripf Jf 14# At th© Ojair Conference in question which was attended by Bin Baud, Sir Percy Cox, th© Minister of Public Works (for Iraq) and Abdul Latif Pasha al 1 endil of Basra (un-offioial adviser to Bin Baud), I distinctly recollect that Bin Baud started off by insisting that the Dh&amp;fir, an Iraq tribe of Bedouin, was his and that it was necessary for his boundary to extend right up to the Euphrates not because he wished to control that river, but because the Dhafir as well as his big bedouin tribes actually moved up annually to the Euphrates and would never ba denied right of access, which was a question of life and death for the desertman. hen it was pointed out by Bir Percy Cox that this claim was a ridiculous one and could not be discussed, Bin Baud gave in over the Phafir tribe and adopted the more reasonable line that to safeguard the rirhts of his own tribes and prevent future trouble there should be a tribal boundary « v &lt;* a •-i. A, described by the system of wells e£ and grazing grounds owned by each tribe. This, he said, would be easy as everyone was aware of these, and each tribe from the days of Abraham knew exactly which were its wells and grazing grounds and which were not* That is to say he advocated for instance that the Bouthern-most wells claimed by the Anaze, T hafir and Kuwait tribes (excluding Mutair, Awa: ira and Ajman which he claimed) should form the boundary, while any wells known to be common property (such existed between Anaze and Dhafir, and between Dhafir and Mutair tribes) were to be declared neutral* 15* hen asked how the claims to these wells were to be proved Bin Baud retorted that the Desert world knew them as clearly as the light of day, and moreover tribal osems or marks, existed on the inner walls of almost all of them, and in the unlikely event of a dispute arising in the matter the n Ahl el Khlbra fT or wise men with knowledge, could put the matter right. In any case Bin Baud maintained the right of Hejd tribes to go up to th© Euphrates to make their annual purchases* The Iraq representative Bubht Peg when asked his.*3 \ *•' 5 *» his views on a proper frcmtier declared for a titne at least 200 miles South of the Euphrates, and insisted that Iraq would accept nothing else. 16. oir Percy Cox attempted the 'via media' but could not get Bin Saud to budge an inch from his 'tribal bounder/* idea. Eventually At a private meeting at which only Dir Percy -ox, Din baud, and I were present, sir Percy Cox lost all patience, over what h© c lied the childish attitude of Bin baud, and we had the astonishing sight of Bin Saud being 'told off' like a naughty Schoolboy by H.M’s High Commissioner and being told sharply that he, Sir Percy Cox, would himself decide on the type and general line of the frontier line. his ended the impasse. Bin Gaud almost broke down and pathetically remarked that f ir Percy Cox was his father and mother who had made him and raised him from nothing to the position he held, and that he would surrender half his kingdom, nay the whole, if he, Sir Percy Cox, ordered. H© ended by agreeing that Sir Percy Cox should himself decide for him this vexed question. 17. The existing boundary as we know it resulted. It was drawn up practically by Sir Percy Cox himself with a few suggestions here and there by Dr.Abdullah Damluji, Secretary to Bin baud, Major More and myself. Bin baud took little further part in the discussions as far as I can remember and the map showing the final selected line was later put before him for final approval by Dr*Abdulla. Among other interested spectators pt these far reaching events were imin Baihani and Major Holmes. IB. The disappointed Bin baud feeling no doubt that he had been outwitted by the Iraq delegates and fir Percy Cox, and that the problem had been settled according to European standards and not by methods that would have been understood by the Arabian world, would appear to have from that day decided on a policy of slowly but surely divertingdiverting from and preventing his people from having their old and time honoured ooramunioation with either Iraq or Kuwait and tried to force them to get their necessities ox life and daily renuireroents from Ojair, Qfttif and Jubail, his ports, instead. 19. ; g doubt also he was guided by the fact that for political reasons and to prevent intrigue, it were better to prevent his tribes from having direct contact with States which he felt were not friendly. But natural lines of trade cannot thus be lightly interfered with or laid aside^and as a result of this policy, we have seen nothing but trouble* Had Bin Haud left well alone, it is not improbable that we should never have had the Akhwan Rebellion 0 1929-30, or the friction between Iraq and Hejd which preceded it, not to mention the long drawn out agony of the Kuwait Blockade. 20* As regards the question of firing some sort of a boundary between Bin Baud and the Trucial Coast tribes, resulting from the new Blue Line policy: If I may say so, I consider the only sensible way to settle such problem would be to have a tribal boundary* As a preliminary, the Murra tribe must be acknowledged to be Bin Sand’s, and h© must be asked what other tribes he claims in the hinterland. The Trucial Coast tribes are those making up the Bani Tas and Jowassim confederations. They include the various trucial coast towns and hamlets right up to Qatar* Bin Baud must be told in any agreement come to something in the following lines: (a) He must respect the tribal wells and grazing zones in the interior used from time immemorial by the Trucial Coast tribes and their Shaikhs. (b) Both his and the Trucial Coast tribes may pass into each others territories in search of grazing when necessary, without let or hindrance. (c) Saudi tribes should at all times have the rightV ? ( v5&gt;) right to 'Musabilah' to the Coast towns (i.e. bay thalr provisions there), and neither he nor the truclal coast Chiefs must prevent such operations unless carried out in a non friendly and peaceful manner. (d) The tribes of either Saudi Arabia or of the Trucial Coast if grazing in each others country to be liable to pay Zikat to either Bin sand or the crucial Coast Shaikhs as the case may be. Some clausa.' should also be taken to insure that Bin Saud does not order his big tribes to settle permanently in Truoial Coast territory, simply by way of bullying though if left to themselves they will of course give no trouble, 20. It is an axiom that Nejd tribes will never voluntarily want to hurt coastal towns or their tribes anywhere in Arabia, as they draw supplies from them, and do not want their Muoablla stopped. Any trouble will * (au*( always be caused by the ruler who can bring pressure in this case Bin Saud. 21.

It was also agreed that a corollary of this policy might be that the large area of indefinite no man's land which at present lies between the territories of our clients (the ^rab Shaikhs of the iersian Gull* including the Sultan of .luscat) and the Saudi .mpire might have to disappear} that the frontiers of the Arab Sheikhdoms might have to be defined and drawn on the map (it would be impossible to do so on the ground)} and that these frontiers and those of the Saudi empire would have to be co-teminous. 2. Since the meeting 1 have been giving this question of frontiers some further consideration, ana have come to the conclusion that though these frontier lines will look very nice and neat on the map, off the map and In actual working practice they may be a considerable nuisance, if not a danger. Frontiers, while necessary elsewhere, in Arabia are merely necessary evils onl^ to be drawn w ien unavoidable. The population of the country is nomadic - the tribes wandering considerable distances according to the season in search of water and pasture, the average Arab Shaikh has a very vague idea as to where his territory begins and ends, aiid often there are no well-defined physical features along which a boundary could conveniently be placed. In the eyes of tine average Ar;&gt;b - and when one is considering the creation of frontiers one must consider local public opinion however /- 2 - however unorthodox this may appear - a frontier is not so much geographical as tribal and political. A Shaikh in answer to a question as to how far his authority extends p and will rarely answer irom a to B 5 he will say over sucfy&gt;uch a tribe* 3* The advantages of the present situation, under which there are no fixed frontiers between the territories of our clients and Ibn 3aud f s empire, are obvious* ..here there are no frontiers there can be no encroachments. If, for instmce, there is raiding and counter-raiding in the Arabian hinterland of the Trucial Coast, neither our clients nor Ton Baud can apply to us. The matter is settled some how or other between the two parties. Once however we draw definite frontiers - in itself a matter of great difficulty and involving amongst other features the consent of our clients (inducting the Sultan of Muscat, juridically an independent sovereign) - the question will assume quite a different aspect. A raid or an encroachment across a frontier (which however clear on a map will be totally unintelligible to the tribes on the spot) by Ibn Baud’s oedouln will be followed by an appeal from our injured client; while a similar rdd or encroachment by one of cur clients will be followed by a note from Ibn Baud. In these circumstances it seems probable that we may be engulfe&lt; in a morass of complaints and counter-complaints, the net result of which will be not an entente with Ibn Baud, which is our object, but the reverse. 4* Further * the drawing of fixed frontiers might well involve His Majesty*s Government in a measure of responsi bility for protecting their clients by land as well as by sea, (except for Kuwait and the contingent assurance recently/k recently given to Qatar our defensive commitments to the other 3haikhB are limited to the sea only). Do ills Majesty*s Government want to commit themselves to maintaining the authority of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs up to a line drawn in the interior far away from the coast? Lastly - Xbn Saud f like the rest of us, must die some day. Nobody, I think, knows exactly what will happen when he is gathered to his fathers, ib meet this eventuality would not a more or less fluid situation be ^referable to a static one ? 1 5. I certainly do not suggest that the difficulties noted above should in my way hold up whatever steps can now oe taken to negotiate an understanding with Ibn 3aud f b^t I think tfxey should be borne in mind. I think also that it might be possible to overcome them. While fixed frontiers ai‘e unavoiaaole between the SiUdi ^mpire and countries such as Iraq and Transjordan, I doubt whether they c*re essential between the Trueial Coast and the Saudi iaanpire. It might be possible once in a way to adopt the Arabian point oi view, and make the frontiers tiibal instead of geogr iphical, and to say to Ibn Bauds not that we agree thut your territory exteiids up to such and such imaginary line, outs we agree that your autixority extends over such and such tribes. 6. The idea in itself (though on this point dir Andrew is naturally the best authority] might appeal to I bn baud as falling in with Arab ideas, as giving him ~ ostensibly at any rate - plenty of elbow roote, and as avoiding fixed frontiers which arouse in most Arab rulers a feeling of pronounced claustrophobia* 7. I see one difficulty in connection with this tribal frontier suggestion and doubtless there are more. ^he tribes which Ibn Baud raises claim to may come much nearer to/to the coast than suits us. However I think tne suggestion is worth exploring and one step in this direction would be - at some stage in the proceedings - to obtain from Ibn Baud a list of the tribes in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and Oman territories which he claims to be under his suzerainty. When this list is available we will try and «' work out what are the rough geographical limits of these tribes#-2 common property (auch existed between Axuue ajtd dbafir, ar;d between Dtaflr and utair tribes) were to be declared neutral. Wfean asked how the clairas to %hm&lt;&amp; wells were to be proved Ibn Saud retorted that the Desert world knew them as clearly as the light of day, mid moreover tribal 'W©seir.s' or aarks, existed on the Inner walls of almost all of thej*, in the unlikely event of a dispute arisiiig in matter the tt idil el Khibra' or wise men with knowledge, could put Uie matter right.

Marking of the frontier between Kuwait anl Iraq on Survey of India maps. H A A • Sir, I have the honour to refer you to India Office Air Mail Printed Letter No.4532, dated 16th August 1935, enclosing their letter P.Z.4532/35, dated 13th August 1934 to the Under Secretary of State, Forei Office, London. 2. From para 3 of this letter, it would appear that the Marquess of Zetland proposed to address the Government of India in the terms of the ’*enclosed draft”. 3# A copy at' this Enclosed draft” has not been sent to me, but it would appear from the context, that the Survey of India Department have proposed that the frontier line between Kuwait and Iraq should be marked on their maps in future, and that the Marquess of Zetland intends to inform them of the definition of the Iraq-Kuwait frontier” as was reaffirmed by the Iraq Government and H.L. the Shaikh of Kuwait vide my Confidential despatch No.129, dated 12th Augist and previous correspondence so that they (the Survey of India) can work on that document. 4. As we are now going to ”put something on the Map”, I think it behoves us to get the matter done very carefully so as to avoid any chance of future argument or difference of opinion between the two States concerned. 5. in, this connection I have been examining the actual wording of the definition of the Iraq-Kuwait frontier nSubmitted with Colonial Office No.P.Z.2828/32, dated 11th May 1932, and find that the wording is somewhat loose, and nay mislead the Survey of India Department, and result in their entering on their Maps a line sli^itly differing from what we here recognize as the true frontier line, and which I believe is also understood to be such by the Iraq authorities. I refer to the words (a) 'and thence northwards along the Batin to 'point just south of the latitude of 'Safwan'. (b) 'Xe&amp;nce eastwards passing south of Safwan 'wells, Jabal Sanam and Um Qasr, leaving 'them to Iraq'. 6. Taking 5(a) first: The Batin valley, for His Majesty’s Government’s information, varies in width frcm 1 to 5 miles throughout its length, and by a survey official living at a distance and not knowing the actual ground, the question might legitimately be asked how is the line ' thence northwards along the Batin' , to be placed on the nap? Does it run on the western edge, down the centre, or along the eastern edge? For your information, we here, and the Iraq authorities, I gather, have always worked on the assumption that the boundary line runs up the centre line of the valley, this being the coonarrion s )nse view to take of the wording of the 'Definition'. This also gives both sides an equal share of this fertile grazing valley. I suggest therefore that the Survey of India be told of this cornua nsense interpretation and advised to draw thoir line accordingly. 7. Regarding 5(b): We here have always understood the northern boundary of the frontier to run In a 'aue_Sast arvi Heat straight line' , from the Batin (centre line/ to Bafwan wells (where a large Notice a point one mile bouth of3 - Notio 3 Board exists on the side of the Road which today marks the actual boumary). tfrom there, the boundary continues, also in a straight line, but in a soutn~easterly direction to the junction of the hh.ar hubair with the Mi or Abdulla. The whole line thus drawn leaves each of the points known as Jabai namm . oaf ~ ; an, and Um c t ,asr to Iraq, with a space of about a mile to spare. Here again I suggest that the survey of India follow our local inter pretation, whan fixing their line on the map. 8. I trust I have not laboured the point overmuch, but in putting forward the above, I am guided solely by our local knowledge and existing practice, ana by the fact that there is definitaly ’'room* 1 for tho Survey of India officials to go wrong. Were this to happen, then both Iraq and Kuwait might raise objection, end a 'bone of contention' always to be avoided, might be opened up. considered, for it is important, I think. As I have not mentioned the matter to the Shaikh of Kuwait at all, I think, it would be just as well not to draw the Iraq Government’s attention to it either. 9 I trust that my above note will be carefully I have the honour to be Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel Political Agent, KuwaitConfidential 17.9. ^ a .V&gt; * The Residency, The Residency, Bushire, the 12th August 1935 11 D.O.No.603-3. My dear Dickson, As you are no doubt aware, discussions have been proceeding recently in London with Fuad Bey regarding, among other questions, the frontier between Sa*udi Arabia and ^atar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms. 2. I enclose a copy of a list of wells claimed on behalf of the Al Morrah by Fuad Bey. Have you by any chance any Al Morrah friend handy, from whom you could (a) check these wells to see whether they are actually claimed by the Al Morrah and if so whetiier they are claimed to be tribal property or merely that they (the Al Morrah) among others make use of them and (b) enquire to what extent any real authority or control is exercised over the Al Morrah in that area by Ibn 3a*ud or Ibn Jiluwi. 3. His Majesty’s Government are anxious to get information on these points as early as possible and I should / Lieut.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.ItE., Political Agent, Kuwait.should be grateful if you would let me have a reply as soon as you can. I quite realise that you may not be able to help, but I know that you have a great many friends among the tribes and so may be in a position to get valuable informa tion. Yours sincerely,POUT I CAL AGSUCY, ''' S&lt;a ') no i'iW ID TI iiL» D.o.No* G-258. KUWAIT. Dated the 23rd August 1935. Will you refer to your Confidential D.0.No.603-S, dated 12th August 19 35 and enclosure, being List of wells claimed on behalf of the A1 Murra tribe by Fuad Hamza. 1. I have not been able to get hold of aiay of my Murra friends in Kuwait, as at this season of the year (Sumner) they are all camped on water far to the South, but I have interviewed en Ajman shaikh who knows most of the Murra country as far South as Wabar (Urn al Hadida) pretty intimately, and has a Murri wife. He at present resides in Kuwait, because he is 'wanted' by Bin Saud, and living here is more healthy in consequence. 2. Of Fuad’s list of wells my men knows the following personally, or has good hearsay knowledge of them: 2,3,4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 26, 32,52, 70,71,72 ,73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 92, 94, 97, 106 , 107 , 116, 117, 123, 157, 158, 159, 161 • 3. He furthermore assures me that the Murra 'dira' stretches south in the form of a rough elongated parallelogram fron close to Hoffuf down to the wells of 'Shanna', 'Mamura', 'Zuwaira' and 'Turaiwa ,f (See Philby’s map and point furtherest south which he reached, also Thomas map), and is more or less enclosed in the area bounded by the following. (a) Western Boundary. Proa Hofuf down the Eastern side of the Suaman plateau to 'Maqainama' wells leaving the whole of the Jabrin Oasis to the Murra. Prom 'Maqainema wells' the boundary goes by a curved line south-east to»Shanna wells”, (See Hiilbrs The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel G.Loch, C.I.B. ,I.A., Political Resident in the Persian uulf, BU SHIRK.(b) Northern Boundary runs South-east approximately along the line of wells known as Zanurqa, Bir al Nab it, BAHATH, Bir Azila, round the southern edge of the Qatar boundary to Sabkhat Matti (See Thomas Map) a n&amp;rshy strip running some 40 miles into the interior from the sea coast. (o) Eastern Boundary, runs from the Sabkhat Matti in a south-easterly straight line to ft Sabkhat Mi .1 or a” at the junction of the parallels 54°and 20? (d) southern Boundary. From Sabkhat Mjora to Shaima wells, and includes the Al Rashid tribal country.(This latter tribe b&lt; being 'beni Am” of the Murra, and an offshoot of the ' tribe of that name living in Nejran). To make my meaning clear I enclose a rou^i sketch, showing also Thomas route up the centre. 4. My informant was insistent that east of the Sabkhat Mutti lay the Manasir tribal country, vfoich in similar fashion extended right south to the Al RAMLA (heavy sands) keeping the Murra ’‘dira”on their left. 5. Similarly to the east of the Manasir 'dira”, lay the Awemir tribal country known as the Dhafra, and so on to the various tribes lying West of Jabal Mkhdar, all of whom had a wedge of territory running into the heart of the ” Ram la ”. 6. The Murra being good 'Sunnis^, had little to do with the Manasir and avoided them and their country and did not marry with them, for the reason that, though of good stock, they (the Manasir) followed the Khawarij creed, which was something akin to the Shiah belief and so abhorrent. 7. Not content with the above evidence, I sought out and found another old Ajmi tribesman, i&amp;o also is related to the Murra by marriage and apparently knows their country as far as Shanna. This person who I have known for 7 years now, and have always found, reliable,- 3 - reliable, oorroborated all that the first mn told me. He however added that sinoe there was a 'HU^UM' in h 0 (meaning the strong am of Bin Sand), there was for less enmity between the Murra and the dai’ar, lianakh 11 and other tribes of the Bhofar hinterland, and that groups of these penetrated North into AX Rashid and Murra country to the 20th parallel of latitude and grazed with the Murra in the spring. . .und now to come to questions 2(a) and (b) of your D.O. under reference: (a) Beyond what I have already said in para 2 above I cannot, I am afraid, say whether the 161 wells mentioned by Fuad Hamza, all belong to the Murra tribe, or include Manasir and Awamir wells also. I should, hazarding a guess, say the names have been obtained from a full blown Murri, who might have been encouraged to give names of wells not strictly belonging to his tribe. (A bedouin will nearly always try and make out he owns a bigger M dira' than he actually does). I have closely compared Fuad Hamza’s list of wells also with those given on Philby’s and Thomas maps and find that Nos.1,4,5,8, 9,11,12,13,27,28, 75, 76, 77, 86, 87, 88, 94, 106, 107, 124, 125, 154, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161 are mentioned on Philby’s map, and Nos.l, 8, 18, 65, 72, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 99 79, 81, 82, 83, 89, 90, 98, 101, 113, 117, 118, 148, 159, and 161 are found on Thomas map, but of course beyond the fact that the existence cf these wells is proved neither map shows to whom the wells especially the Pastel^ones, belong. (b) I should say that Bin Baud and his Lieutenant Bin Jiloui today do exercise entire and real authority over all the Murra and over the whole of their country, but not in the sense that you or His9./ 4 His Majesty’s G-overment might possibly think: To explain what I mean:- The Murra, other tribes for that matter, can not hope to exist during thd Summer months in the Rub al Khali region or in any part of it. They must move north to more congenial climes, where they can graze and water their camels daily. Such places they find in the great Jabrin Oasis, (essentially their om headquarters) roundabout Hoffuf. That is the time when Bin Baud taxes them and takes 'Zikat*. In the Winter and Spring and immediately after rain has fallen in the Rub al Khali, out go the Murra, and they disappear hnd scatter among the sandy wastes, until it is time to come north again for the summering period. Bin Baud therefore never has to bother to send out tax-gatherers further than Hoffuf and Jabrin. On the other hand, should a Shaikh he wanted in the Spring grazing season, a single man (fidawi) or tribal employee of Bin Baud has but to move down to where the tribe is grazing, and he soon finds his man. A verbal order from him does the rest. Ho man dare disobey such messenger’s summons, it is as much as his life is worth to do so. He knows he will be ’’got” when Summer cames like a bird walking into a cage. Should the Manasir, Awamir or other neighbouring tribe start raiding the Murra, so as to become a nuisance (this can only happen in the Jinter aid Spring) then it is up to Bin Saud or Bin Jaloui to send a 'Ghazzu* to assist them deal with the situation. This is the tribes due, since they have paid Zikat.I trust I have not written at too great length Yours sincerely,WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OP THE HONOURABLE THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. 8/9/55.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to your letters of the 24th April and the 12th June, Hos.D. 1644-N/35, and F. 169-1:1/35, in which it is suggested that the frontiers between Koweit and Efejd and between Koweit and Iraq should be shown as undemarcated boundaries on Survey of India maps. 2. The Secretary of State, who has consulted the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the matter, is of opinion that it is desirable for these boundaries to be shown. It is, however, important that nothing should be done which could cast any doubt on their alignment or validity. To use the symbol for undemarcated boundaries, with the addition of the word 'approximate', might give the erroneous impression that the boundaries are not clearly defined. His Lordship therefore thinks it preferable that the word 'approximate should not be used and considers that a note should be made on the maps themselves in regard to each frontier stating, in the one case, that the frontier was defined in 1923 and specifically reaffirmed by agreement between Iraq and Koweit in 1932, in the other that the frontier was defined by the Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922. 3.

Bagdad. 30th October, 1935 British Embassy, Sir, With reference to your despatch No.683(E 5628/127/91) of October 9th, I have the honour to offer the following observations on the proposals put forward in the despatch from the Political Agent, Kuwait, No.C-262 of August 27th, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the frontier between Kuwait and Iraq. jo ? 7 (, 2. Colonel Dickson points out certain ambiguities in the description of the frontier line as laid down by Sir Percy Cox in his letter to the Political Agent, Kuwait, NoC B4C5 of April 19th, 1923. In order to overcome the difficulties which they present to the cartographer, he proposes that the line traced on the maps of the Survey of India should follow the frontier which, he suggests, is recognised in practice in Kuwait. 3 . This unilateral method of removing such uncertainties as may exist appears to me to be open to serious objection. I appreciate that no map published by the Survey of India could be held to be a binding interpretation of the provisions of Sir Percy Cox*s letter or of the notes exchanged between the Ruler of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq in 1932. But, as it is proposed that the new maps should indicate that the frontier shown is that defined in 1923 and reaffirmed by the Governments of the two limitrophe countries in 1932, the Iraqi Government might, with good reason, / The Right Honourable Sir Samuel J.G.Hoare, Bt.,GCSI.,GBE., etc., etc•, etc.6. / - 2 ~ / yy ^if'\ reason, raise objections if this frontier line were adjusted solely with regard to the local views of Kuwait. 4. It is on record in the archives of the High Commision that, at the time when the Prime Min&amp;ster( then Nuri Pasha) was moved by Sir Francis Hurnphr, s to exchange notes with the Ruler of Kuwait reaffirming the frontier between Kuwait and Iraq, he made special enquiries regarding the position of Hulaibe in the Batin. He said that this watering place hed always been regarded as being in Iraq and that police posts hrd been located there on several occasions &lt;* notably , in 1927. He pointed out that the description of the frontier which he was advised to reaffirm seemed to leave this matter in some doubt, as much would depend on how the line was drawn from the junction of the ^adi al Audja with the Batin, northwards to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan. The High Commissioner reassured Nuri Pasha by emphasising that the exchange of notes was merely a reaffirmation of the status quo and that no change in the frontier line was intended or involved. He also showed the Prime Minister the map illustrating the text of Sir Percy Cox's letter of April 1923 to the Political Agent, Kuwait, contained in the compilation of treaties and agreements between the British Government and certain Arab Rulers (edition of 1926) published by the Government of India, on which Hulaiba(or Halaiba) is clearly marked on the Iraqi side of the frontier line. 5. I am unable to say whether these watering holes are correctly placed on this map, but it appears that if Colonel Dickson's proposals are adopted and the frontier line o n -be map of the Survey of India is drawn along the centre of the Batin, Hulaiba will probably be shown in Kuwait.6 . /part from the question of Hulaiba, which I cite only proposals might give rise, the position of the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait is likely to become a matter of increasing importance, both on account of the impending exploitation of oil in Kuwait and of the preventative measures to undertake to suppress smuggling across the border. I consider, therefore, that it is inadvisable that the equitable settlement of such disputes as may arise in the future regarding the alighment of the frontier should be prejudiced by the publication of official maps on which the line shown will have been drawn according to a unilateral interpretation of the international documents in fthich the frontier is laid down. 7. /s you are aware, the line described in Sir Percy Cox * s letter of April 1923 to the Political Agent, Kuwait, was intended to be identical with the Green Line of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of July 29th, 1913, and it appears to me desirable that this latter line should be most carefully reproduced in all official maps on which the frontier cetween Iraq and Kuwait is shown. 8 . I am informed that the Geographical Section of the General Staff will shortly issue a new map of the country adjacent to the Kuwait-Iraq frontier on a scale of 1: 500,000 and I would suggest that the results of this survey might with advantage be studied by the Survey Department of India before they issue the new maps which they have under considera 1 t ion. 9 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, Sd.

If you will examine the map of Kuwait scale 1.500,000 completed two years ago by Major Papworth ,K.D., (attached aa. ?. Headquarters, Iraq Command) and issued in proof form in .^ich 1934 which survey, I think, we must ail admit, is the very latest and most accurate map of Kuwait and the adjacent is aq tenitory , you will find that Hulaiba wells fall on the Iraq side of the particular frontier line proposed by me. That is to say If OIi0 takes Samuel J.G.Hoare ,Bt. ,CrCSl etc. P y S • 2 # I think H.M* s ruabassador, Baghdad, in making his observ- ations on the position of j ulalba wells must have read my despatch f S o*take the centre line of the Batin t o be the frontier, the said wells which lie in the Batin depression itself will be found to be just inside Iraq. 4 # When writing my despatch Ho.C-262 of 27th august 1925, I confess freely that I had this map before me, which from close personal knowledge of the Batin valley, I knew to be far more accurate then the old Basra Million sheet, which we have all hitherto worked on. 5 . You will further observe that Major Papworth himself in his map (which I gave you and which you have in the Bushire Office) has placed Hulaiba about one mile inside Iraq. as a matter of fact I am of opinion that Major Papworth has here gone slightly wrong with his frontier line and should have drawn it (the frontier line) from w.8fwan in a due westerly straight line until it struck the centre line of the Batin, after which it should have followed the centre line of the Batin, as he has correctly made it do as far as A1 Auja in the south. In spite of this personal view of mine, however, Hulaibafrould still fall just inside Iraq territory by a hundred yards or more. 7 # jn view of my above remarks I think that B.M’s Ambassador will perhaps appreciate that my suggestion as regards fixing the centre line of thi Batin as the frontier was not made lightly, and certainly with no intention to gain something for Kuwait at the expense of Iraq. I Knw, the .^atin district well, perhaps better than any living person today and the frontier line as proposed by me was one * ich 1 considered not only the fairest, but one least licely to cause futule argument or heart burning. The advantage of such line would, I think, be at once admitted by H.k* s .ambassador himself if he were himself to see it on the ground, especially as thi ougnout its entire length there is today a deep ana clearly defined motor car track made by the R.A.F. in lb2y-30 .which as near as possible forms an artificial demarcation line. Lt.-Colonel, CONTLIUBD. ^ pollticel -6 ent &gt; KU * alt ‘9 After Note. It will give me genuine pleasure if on H.M* s ambassador’s next visit to Kuwait he will permit me to conduct him to the Batin valley, and show him part or the whole of that unique natural feature.jjy \ &lt; RVA C onfidential, To No.1036-3 of 1935.

You will see that the Ambassador attaches considerable importance to having the word 'huiaiba' clearly marked on the Iraqi side of the frontier, both in the case of the waterhole and in that of the hill.

I would suggest, however, that as the water-hole of Hulaiba is situated slightly to the east of Hulaiba hill (the name of which is printed in upright characters on the map enclosed in your despatch under reference), its name (in italic letters) should, if possible, be moved to the Iraqi side of the frontier line. 2* with regard to paragraph 8 of your despatch, I have some V doubt whether it would be expedient to ask for the concurrence of the Iraqi GQ 7 eminent to the proposed marking of this frontier This has not been sought for the frontier line between Iraq and Saudi Arabia shown on the new war Office 1/500,000 maps of Salman-Busaiya, Ash Shabash and wadi al Gbaiyidh, and 1 fear that a reference in this sense regarding the Kuwait frontier might easily give rise to suspicion. The Iraqi Government, of course, know that the oil of Kuweit is now being exploited &amp;hd have heard rumours that oil-bearing formations have been discovered close to the frontier. They might, therefore, believe that, in asking them to agree to the proposed lino, we were trying to trick them into accepting an interpretation of the frontier favourable to Kuwait*® oil interests* lin.^e and similar suspicions might be allayed i£ I were authorised to light Honourable Anthony Sden, M.C., M*P., eto., etc.expX&amp;in 'fcliiit the proposod line w&amp;s iuercly a CE^'to^,Ttipile^ , s interpretation of the frontier described in the notes exchanged between the Huler of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq in 193^ and couid not prejudice a final demarcation made iormalxy by agreement betv/een Kuwait and Iraq, Nevertheless, I aai disposed to think that it would be better that the matter should not be referred to the Iraqi Government at all, 3. Ifi however, in spite of the considerations set out above, you desire me to seek the concurrence of the Iraqi Government, I should be glad to be authorised to make the explanation suggested in the preceding paragraph and to be furnished with a map showing the line finally approved by\ His Majesty^ Government, It would, X think, be confusing if I were to show the Iraqi government the map enclosed in your despatch and had, at the same time, to explain the alterations to the frontier line proposed in paragraphs 5 and 6 thereof, 4, I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, to the Political Resident in the leAsian Gulf, and to the Political Agent at Kuwait.

Sir, Hth reference-to correspondence ending with your despatch No. 576 (377/9/35) of the 30th October, regarding the alignment of the frontier between Iraq and Koweit, I have to inform Your Excellency that the matter has now been considered by the interested departments of His Majesty’s Government with special reference to the results of the survey recently carried out on that frontier by personnel of His Majesty’s Forces. A copy of a sketch map showing the relevant parts of the uncompleted 1/500(^,000 map based on that survey is enclosed for your information. 2. As you are aware the definition of the Koweit-Iraq frontier reads as follows: 'From the intersection of the Wadi al Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan? thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jebel sanm and Dm Qasr, leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zabeir with the Khor Abdullah”. As you pointed out in paragraph 7 of your despatch under reference, the frontier as defined above was intended to be identical with the frontier defined in the Anglo-, arkish donvention of the 29th July, 1913, and shown as a green line on the map attached thereto. 3. This green line which you suggest should be most carefully reproduced on all official maps on which the frontier between Koweit and Iraq appears, is represented as following the centre of the Batin. His Majesty's Governmen x 4-v^ of anv other indication following the centre ol tne are of opinion that in the absence of any other indication : the text, this is the proper construction :,o oa upcn the words 'along the Batin*. The Batin, however, is now known to follow a winding and not, as shown ne i sketch-map, a virtually rectilinear course. His Majes y s the centre of the Batin. His Majesty’s Government 4.W Xhoonoft of anv other indication in are of opinion that in the absence of any other indicate the text, this is the proper construction to be placea a the words -along the Batin-. The Batin, however, is now known to follow a winding and not, as shown in the x913 His Majesty's GovernmentGovernment do not therefore regard it as practicable to adopt mere than the principle exemplified by the n green line” of 1913* For Gtnalogous reasons they regard as erroneous the frontier shovm on the 1923 sketch-map referred to in paragraph 4 of your despatch, since although the course of the Batin is there shown as winding, the frontier as shown as straight* 4* His Majesty’s Government have closely examined the question raised in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your despatch, namely the effect on die political attribution of Hulaiba of drawing the frontier-line down the centre of the Batin. Although this water-hole is not mentioned in any of the instruments defining the frontier or on the map attached to the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1918, it would indeed appear from the m sketch-map of 1923 that it was intended to leave Hulaiba in Iraq, as before* It is understood from Major Papworth, B.B., L ibU&gt; conducted the recant survey, that the name 'Hulaiba 11 in uori&amp;ht characters on the enclosed sketch-map refers to the small hill wnich is marked in the bed of the Batin about one mile to the East of meridian 47° 15’ East: and that the water-hole itself (to which ihe name in italio letters jefers) is sivaated very slightly to the east of the above-mentioned hill. In the light of this information His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the- frontierfrontier if drawn down the centre of the Batin, as in the broken line on the enclosed sketch-map, would not leave Hulaiba in Koweit. 5. Careful consideration has also been i*iven to the question of the intepretation to be placed on the words 'northwards to a point just south of the latitude *of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, VebelSanm ...'etc. You are no doubt aware that the Batin, as is showik on the enclosed sketch map, is continued to the north-east of Hulaiba by a prolongation or delta, called Mufrash, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the words quoted above must be taken to mean that the frontier-line should continue down the centre of Mufrash (not, as on the enclosed sketch-map, down the eastern side) until it reaches the prescribed point * just south of the latitude of oafwan'. The Political Agent, Koweit, has stated that there is a signboard marking the frontier at a point one mile south of Safwan. In the absence of any indication that the position of this signboard is disputed locally, His Majesty’s Government regard the point at which the frontier should leave the Batin (Mufrash) as lying a similar distance south of the latitude of Safwan, and they consider that the frontier should thence proceed due eastwards. They note moreover, that according to Colonel Dickson, this is the interpretation locally accepted. 6. From Safwan to the Persian Gulf, His Majestyb Government see no reason to dissent from the frontier line which the Pol. Agent at Koweit has indicated as one being local ly accepted, namely, a straight dne from a point milemile south of Saf van to the junction of the Khor 7/a hair and the Xhor Abdullah, although there is room for doubt as to the exact way i n which tills line should appear on a map* The line represent** ing this sector of the frontier on the enclosed sketch-map has been ^on older maps and is not, in the view of His Majesty^ Government, the best line which can be deduced from the definition. In their view this line should be drawn straight from a point a mile south of Gafwan to the tri-junction of the Khor Jubair, the Khor She tana and the Khor as-Sabiya, since this point as Nearly as possible the junction of the Khor flubair and the Khor Abdullah. Careful examination of the results of the recent survey do not suggest to His Majesty’s Government that any material point can be involved. 7* In general, as you will observe, this drawing of the northern sector of the Koweit-Ira* frontier has the general support of the maps attached to the 1913 Anglo-Turkish Convention and to the print of the 1923 exchange of letters referred to in paragraph 4 of your despatch. The curve by which this sector has hitherto seen represented on the ^International* Asia map on a sc*le of 1/1,000,000 issued by the War Office does not appear to rest on any forn^l agreement and cannot even be regarded as an illustration of local practice, still leas, of course, as an authoritative interpretation, of any existing instrument.

The more northerly one marked should be deleted. (b) Khor al MAKTA’A should be spelt Khor al MaQTA’ (See Neutral Lone ^outh-East corner), like the Island of the same name which is correctly spelt. (c) All sea-faring men inform ae that in MAQTA’ area trier* are three Khors, two having Debouchment • o^th of Has Khaf ji Khor al nMI )kno* together as al KHIBAN : iill Khar MaFaTTAH ) andand one known simply as al MAQ,TA f , being the largest and deepest, and having its debouchment into the sea w Near ,f and iMorth of Has MliiHit’AB* In other words the al MAQTA* probably is douth of the southern frontier of the Neutral -.one and not North of it. If the map remains as marked at present and in certain circumstances, it seems to me that there might easily he confusion and dispute.

(Notes The above proposals in fact confirm the exist ing practical interpretation. There is on the Zubair-Kuwait road about one mile south of Safwan a board marking the point where the road crosses the frontier). £. Yte should also invite the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree that the demarcation shall be carried out on tne same linos as those suggested for tne demarcation oi tho oauciiya frontierfrontier, i.e. a) Completion of the network of triangulation along the frontier zone, where the triangulation is defective, b) Formation of a Joint commission to erect pillars, which shall be intei'visible, the whole length of the boundary. (These pillars shall be similar to those erecteu on the Syrian Boundary and proposed for the Sauui boundary viz ii section iron bars driven into ^ the ground with a pile driver). 3. I have already, in a note concerning the demarca tion of the Saudi boundary explained the technical processes involved, and there is no need to repeat those explanations here. I cannot propose a time-table for the work at present. This depends on whether my proposals for the Saudi demarca tion go forward, In which case tne available Iraqi technicians will be fully occupied, and on whether in this case the British authorities, on behalf of Kuwait, can assist by under taking the necessary preliminary triangulation* But there is no need to enter into this question until agreement in principle has been reached on paras 1 and k above.

In accordance with the instructions contained in paragraph 6 of your telegram No.98 of March 30th, I have strongly advised the Prime Minister to consider the possibility of making early arrangements for the demarkation of the Kuwaiti- Iraqi frontier. He received the sugges tion without enthusiasm saying that it would not stop smuggling. I observed, however, that a line of beacons would in my opinion serve as a usef.il reminder of a pact, both to the Iraqi Police and to intending smugglers.

Foreign Office, LoMon(?) No. 160 Repeated to - Political Resident, Bushire. No. 36 of April 6th to India Office. I agree that establishment of post is a good move and RODHA would appear suitable site. I venture to suggest ■■ however, that time has not yet come for orders to he given to the Kuwait Police to attack the Iraq Police (force?) found in Kuwait# Value of post and outlay is that they movements into Kuwait as compared with Bedouin reports on which representations concerning such incidents have hitherto 'been based, I suggest that orders given to Kuwait Police should he that if Iraq Police are found in Kuwait territory, they should he asked to withdraw and escorted to frontier, full report afterwards being made to the Kuwait authorities. Orders authorizing more drastic measures could he considered if subsequent developments made it necessary to do so. Consideration of support to he given to Kuwait by His Majesty's Government is outside, under no circumstances (my?) province but it would, in my opinion, be most undesirable that forces should be sent from Iraq to rein force those of Kuwait. It would, in fact, tend to render the position of Hoyal Air Force in Iraq, whom we here are S at pains to represent as friends of this country, unplea- sant and difficult. Political Agent, Kuwait.

'I A' ^F.NTIAi Kuitoi: Receipti ojtih- DmaJ -fcp- BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 10th April, 1939. The Iraqi Government have mentioned to me recently that they do not quite like your coming into Iraq without a visa. They allege that it is your custom to fly to the Royal Air Force landing ground at Shaiba and to continue your journey through or stay in Iraq without observing any of the usual formalities. What, I suspect, really made them raise the point was our protest about the Iraqi Police Raids last month, in investigating which they have heard of your visits to the Police Inspector at Safwan on March 16th and 28th; in fact, Nuri specifically cited this to me only the other day. But, assuming the main allegation to be true, could you help me with some general information which would enable me to answer them, for it is embarrassing when your trips to Iraq without notice to the frontier authorities are used to 'prove' that Iraq and Koweit are regarded - at any rate by you - as one country. If you look up the Residency letter to us Ho. G/658 of September 17tn, 1938, you will see that it is there stated that you are in the position TAIN G. S. H. de GAURY, M.C.position of performing consular duties on behalf of Iraq* Do these functions extend to the grant of visas for Iraq, e,g. if an American Missionary wishes to go to Basra does he obtain a visa from the British Political Agency ? If so, I suppose it would be possible for you to give yourself a visa whenever you come into Iraq and thereby to meet all Iraqi objections - except when you come in a Royal Air Force aircraft: but even then your passport could be sent by us or the Basra Consulate to the appropriate authorities to enable them to record your entry. Please let me have your comments. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Resident and to Baxter at the Foreign Office. ■ P.S . official Since the above was drafted we have received an protest on the subject from the Iraqi Government,a translation of which I enclose. I should be glad if you would take this into consideration when letting me have your observations. I also enclose, for convenience of rexerence, a copy of the Iraqi Residencettn. 5012/19 S/lOO, ministry of ibreign Affair®, Bagdad, 3rd At&gt;ril, 1939. The iJLnietry of Sbrtign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic ^jeety 1 ® mhassy, Bagdad, and have the honour to state that according to reporte British reaching them, Captain deGaury, the^Political Resident in Koweit, has recently been ^king frequent visits into Iraq without complying with the provisions of the Residence Law and instructions thereunder, moreover Captain deG&amp;ury has done certain acts which are deemed to constitute interference with the domestic affairs of Iraq and disdain for Iraqi authorities. By way of stating the matter more clearly the Ministry would quote the following incidents (a) Upon Captain dsGaury’s departure from £ubsir on th 30th January, 1939, it was noted that he had entered Iraq without having had the fact endorsed on his passport. (b) on the 22nd ^srch, 19S9, he entered Iraq by air by an irregular route and without the necef* ary oa^^oort foriaalities* (c) On his return journey to Koweit on the 16th j^rch, 1929, he made a halt at Bafwan post getting in touch with the personnel'' of the poet and addressing to them a number of quart lane directly concerning the domestic affairs of Iraq. 2. In deploring these oroceedings on the oart of Captain deGaury, the ministry request the esteemed Embassy to be so good as to cause the necessary stepe to be taken with a view to ensuring the non-reoetition2 of such Incidents which constitute plain contravention and are likely to have undesirable effects. The ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to renew the expression of their highest consideration and esteem. His Britannic i^jesty’s fimbaesy, Bagdad. l i295 NOTIFICATIONS, Etc.

Ho. 0/206 My dear Sir Trenciiard, n 9 Will you please refer to Er. Soustoun-Bostall’s letter Ho. 152/5/39 of April 10th, 1939? I fully agree with his observation which he makes in paragraph 4 of his letter Ho. 152/10/39 of April 17th (I only wish that the Iraqi Government could be persuad ed to adhere to practice in such a way). 2. It was because I felt this to be important that when I paid my first visit to Basra, after taking charge of the Agency, in 1936, I instituted then a new practice of telegraphing to the Mutassarif the date and time of my departures for Basra (which departures incidentally have been almost exclusively due to Iraq.! actions over the Shaikh’s date gardens, although I also had the idea that I might, by contact, be helping to prevent relations deteriorating. Bor example, at the suggestion of the Oriental Secretary, when I was staying in the Embassy recently, I took the trouble to visit the Palace and the Iracii Boreign Office) • The only time I have not sent a warning telegram to the Mutassarif was on 7th April 1939 when the Iraqi telegraph line was out of order. The Basra Consulate dragoman, however, telephoned, according to iiio oructions given him by the Consul, in my presence, to inform the Mutassarif of my arrival, and explain the lack of a tele gram. The dragoman brought the reply from the Mutassarif that 'as I had explained it would be alright this time'. 3 I had of course, as always when travelling by land shown/* 2 - siio vn my po.sspoi'ti wiiich. is in ordsn for Xraq^ at tho passporl and Customs post at Zubair in the customary way, where I have invariably gone for completion of formalities, and where no suggestion that my passport is out of order has ever been made. 4. I did not land at Shaiba on the 22nd March but at Basra. On my return from Baghdad I asked if I might land f at Basra Air Port, but the Boyal Air Force Pilot informed me that Iraqi regulations forbade the landing at Basra of his type of aircraft, one, I understood, having a tail skid to which the Air Port Director objects, so in this case the landing was at Shaiba. However, as you applied for an air craft to take me to Habbaniya and other officials, and the Boyal Air Force, may be affected, you will, I think, prefer^ to reply to this point. 5. The implication that I have been improperly questioning the Iraqi Police officers is of course absolutely unfounded. My letter No. C/114 of March 17th, of which I attach a copy for easy reference, explains why I asked the Police Officer at what hour he expected the MUtassarif. The BoliC€ officer had asked me to take coffee with him which was a little time in coming, and which I did not really want. ^Then he replied that the Mutassarif was coming at any moment I made an excuse to leave. At that moment the cofiee arrived Our only other conversation was desultory, about the weather and the grazing. It was subsequently told by the Jonsul in Basra that the Mutassarif was, or pretended to be, seriously upset at my # questions about his movements' 1 , and I have no doubt therefore that this is the incident to which reference has now been made by the Iraq Government. 6. Otherwise 1 have not spoken to any Iraqi Police offi cer for months, except when I called with Shaikh Ali on the Police post at Safwan on the 26th March, and we asked on arrival/arrival 'Is the Superintendent in the Post', To which the reply was that he was away in 3ubair meeting the lutassarif. We left him our compliments and explained that we were on patrol, leaving immediately. It will he noticed that twice my visits to the frontier have coincided with visits of the Mutassarif to the frontier. His conscience being what it must he about Kuwait, he may think: I have peculiarly good sources of information about his move ments and had deliberately anticipated his visits. ^ . It may help to complete the picture of relations if I describe my courtesy visit to the '^utassarif of Basra on March 25th. The visit was arranged through and with the entire agreement of the Consul at Basra and fixed by the Mutassarif for between 11-30 and 12-30 when the Mutassarif would be in his office. This is my private note on the subject: 'On arrival at the Mutassarifiya no one takes any notice of one. The Police, questioned about the Huta ssarif*s whereabouts, point vaguely up the stairs and continue conversing on their bench. I pick my way up the staircase between squatting petitioners, and spittle and a passing farrash shows me into the Mutassarif *s office. He naif rises behind his table (more courteous in this than his predecessor) and in spite of my attempt to keep off 'politics' he almost at once begins to ask about my recent visit to Baghdad. Why do I go behind his back to Baghdad about the Shaikh’s gardens he asks. (The Charge d f Affaires had mentioned my arrival, and information he had received from me, to Nuri Paohaj. The matter was a simple one, which if I had dealt with him, as was correct, could have been settled quickly* I did not even let him know that i was going through his province, but I fly direct to Baghdad and complain. He shakes his head as one with gloomy forbodings about the/the result for :ae and for the Shaikh. I 8 ay nothing to this and try to change the subject by saying that I aa going, so I sincerely hope, on very long leave quite soon. He rather opens his eyes as if interested, and makes pertinent enquir- ies aTaout my successor. Ee informs me that he has not been to Kuwait or to Europe yet. I shortly leave him, and he struggles, (he is fat and heavy), two paces from his desk with me 'before saying goodbye'. Upper Grade Iraqi officials, whether British or Iraqi, who visit British officials whether in Kuwait or elsewhere, are treated with considerably more respect, and far more nearly in accordance with 'international usage' than this. On my return from the visit I described this conversa tion with the Mutassarif to the British Consul. 8. I have strongly the impression that the Mutassarif is pursuing a course which he conceives will spoil relations at Baghdad of the Kuwait Agency and lower British influence in Kuwait. He is, it is common knowledge, seeing Kuwaiti malcontents in Basra, endeavouring by every means to create trouble in Kuwait, is permitting incursions, the seizure of the Shaikh f s gardens, and scurrilous articles about the Shaikh and Kuwait in the Basra Press. 9. On the other hand I could hardly be more deferential than I have been to Mm, and to the Iraqi frontier, and administrative officials, asd I suggest that tMs unfounded and irrelevant complaint deserves a brusque reply, and no encouragement.

A Your express letter of the 6 th April? No. 3^0-S? and. Bagdad telegram 160. Establishment of Koweiti frontier post at Rodha. 2. Frontier post suggested coupled with patrolling by Koweiti police should be valuable deterrent to incursions from Iraq, and His Majesty’s Government welcome the proposal. They recognise that in certain circumstances (vide para. 3 below) this step might involve the use of force against Iraqi intruders. But while they are bound to protect the independence and integrity of Koweit, and while in the last resort this might involve the use of their land sea or air resources on the Sheikh’s behalf, they are most anxious, in view of v/ider political .and strategical considerations, to avoid such a deterioration of relations with Iraq as would necessitate, and be aggravated by, the use against Iraq oi Royal Air Force forces drawn from Iraq. 3. Instructions to the Koweiti police should therefore V be on the lines suggested in Bagdad telegfak T60 and in (a)(ii) and (b) of your paragraph 5; That is, that peaceful means only should be used to secure the withdrawal of Iragi police from Koweit territory; If these fail the matter should/should be at once reported in order that diplomatic action may be taken* Force should be resorted to only if unavoidable and then only to the extent necessary to resist an actual attack on the Koweiti police in koweiti territory or to protect the lives of individuals. m order that these instructions may be faithfully observed it is impert^nt that the charge of the post should be entrusted to a reliable officer. 4. The Sheikh may be informed that the proposal has the approval of His Majesty's Government? v/ho would give the Sheikh their full support if his police were compelled to use force in the cases provided for in the foregoing instructions. It would be undesirable to define full support further than that in the first instance it would mean diplomatic intervention with the Iraq_ Government and the question of what further measures should be taken if the resources of diplomacy should be exhausted would have to be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. 5* If the Sheikh accepts the proposal and preparations are made to give effect thereto it would seem sufficient (subject to the view of His Majesty’s Representative at Bagdad) to inform the Iraqi Government that the post is being established by the Sheikh '^^h^Jjhe^fuljL^^^ His Majesty’s Government for the protection of his territory from unauthorised incursions. The opportunity can bQ taken to impress on the Iraqis the desirability and urgency of demarcating the frontier between the two countries. 6 ./ */ V' f - 3. 6 .

I have received your letter No,C/i95 dated gist May 1939 corresponding to 3rd Babi ath-Tbani 1358 and noted the sound views, useful suggestions and observations which you have reported to His Majesty’s Government and obtained their approval for the establish ment of a post on the Kuwait-Iraq frontier. I beg to offer you my grateful thanks and deep gratitude for the kind attention and support which you have always been giving me on all occasions. Here I beg to make it clear that when I asked for the establishment of this post, my request was based on reasons of the repeated incursions by the Iraqi Police, and while I was thinking of the establishment of the post in question after consulting His Majesty’s Government for making the necessary arrangements, I was asked, as you sa&amp;d, to postpone the matter. N 0 w, since you have explained all what should be done and pointed out the necessary advices and arrangements, I wish to bring the following facts to your notice:- Firstly : T 0 use HODHA as a post would entail many diffioufcties one of Which is the scarcity of water in that place. I am also afraid that in future the Iraqis might claim that this place marks the frontier between their country and mine Secondly: There is an Cil Company in Kuwait and in Iraq there is another Oil Company, particularly in Sanam district. The operations/- 2 - operations of both these Companies may expand in future and as a result of such an expansion there may exist a contact(clash)between their respective employees and labourers which might cause unnecessary difficulties fpr me. In the circumstances, I m of opinion that the Kuwait Police Post should be on the Kurait-Iraq frontier on the northern side, i.e., opposite SAFWaN, This is my opinion which I am conveying to you and trust that you will take up the matter with His Majesty’s Government far taking such action as they deem fit. In any case, I cannot do anything without your sound viev?s and His Majesty’s Government’s support.

Yours sincerely? (Sgd.) R. C.Y/.Baxter? Esq..? C.M.G. ? M.C. ? Foreign Office? S.W.l. il ‘ V?. Z. 4002/39. SECRET. AIR MINISTRY, KING CHARLES STREET, WHITEHALL, 8. W. 1. S« 30123. 26th June s 1939. Dear Peel ? Thank you for your letter P. Z. 3673/39 dated 19th June, 1939, in which you enquired about the possibility of having an armoured car detachment permanently stationed in Koweit. I have not taken the question up officially, since you suggested we should treat the suggestion as quite informal, and tentative at this stage, so what follows must be taken as a personal opinion. Firstly, as to the possibility of stationing an armoured car section in Koweit as an alternative to Shaibah. Our armoured car strength in Iraq is the minimum required for the defence of our bases at Shaibah, Basrah and Habbaniya, and I think there is no doubt whatever that if an armoured car detachment were to be permanently stationed in Koweit, it would have to be an addition to the present establishment. Then as regards the desirability or otherwise of locating a British armoured car detachment in Koweit. It was my impression that the general opinion at the discussion in April about the proposed frontier post in Koweit, was that while we should have to support the Sheikh of Koweit and in the last resort this might necessitate the use of land, sea or air forces on the Sheikh’s behalf, we should endeavour to settle any incident which might arise by means of diplomatic intervention in the first place. You will remember that Houstoun-Boswall in his telegram No. 160 dated 25th April, thought it undesirable to send forces from Iraq to reinforce those oi Koweit because it E.T. Peel, Esq. , M.C. , India Office, London. would/2. would render the position of tile R.A. F. in Iraci much more difficult. While I do not think we could very well refuse to send forces from Iraq, if diplomatic intervention failed? I feel that the stationing of British forces in Koweit in normal times might he regarded hy the Iraqis as rather provocative. Furthermore? since the armoured car section at Shaihah can reach Koweit so quickly - a matter of about 4 hours - there seems little to he gained hy stationing armoured cars permanently in Koweit. I understand the O.D.C. recently reviewed the defe: ' for Koweit? which are set out in detail in enclosure 4 of O.D.C. Paper No. 1739. These include recommendations for visits and co-operation between Royal Air Force armoured cars and aircraft and the local Koweiti forces? and I understand are considered to he adequate. To sum up I really think that to avoid friction with the Iraqis and any possible clash should further incursions into Koweiti territory occur? the best way is to refrain from stationing armoured cars in Koweit. Provided we maintain our prestige in that part of the world? I think the knowledge that we v/ould support the Sheikh of Koweit? and the fact that we have forces close at hand should he all that is necessary. Yours sincerely? Sgd. M.H. Ely.f SECRET.

Dear Kly, .. eel has sent me a copy of his letter to you of the 19th June (?.2. 3678/39) about the possibility of stationing a snail British force e.g. aa armoured car detachment, permanently in Roweit. 2.

India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 19th June, 1939. 1&gt;' Lk 3\ Dean Ely, You will remember discussion late in April (cf. my letter of the 24th April, No. P.Z. 2489/39) about the proposed establishment of a frontier post in Koweit and the question of giving support to the Sheikh's forces in the event of an attack from Iraq. It was recognised that in case of need such support would have to be supplied by the R.A.F. forces in Iraq and the embarrassment of such a situation was fully appreciated. ^ A'*' ^ 2. A suggestion, inspired by the R.A.F appreciation of the defence of Koweit, has recently been made that the possibility of having a small British force, e.g. an armoured car detachment, permanently stationed somewhere in Koweit itself might be explored, either as an alternative to, or in addition to, the present detachment lag Commander M.H. Ely, Air Ministry, sg Is2. in ohaiban. Roth, the Foreign Office and we ourselves would welcome this step if it could he arranged. Not only would it get over the embarrassment mentioned above but it would be in itself a deterrent of incursions by Iragp police etc. and an earnest to the Sheikh and to the Iraq. Government that our guarantee to protect Koweit will be promptly implemented when the occasion requires it. The defence scheme for Koweit now under consideration would no doubt be greatly strengthened if a British detachment could be kept permanently at Koweit, and the question of storing arms for the defence force would no doubt be simplified, but it may well be that, even if a detachment could be stationed there in time of peace, it would have to be withdrawn in the event of war for service elsewhere unless Koweit itself were seriously threatened. 3. As the Gulf defence schemes are concerned primarily with the situation in time of war I felt it would hardly be appropriate to ventilate the above suggestion at the recent meeting of the Overseas Defence Committee. I should be glad however if you couldnow consider it and let me have your views, treating the suggestion at this stage as quite informal and tentative. If it were to he pursued the political authorities and tne Sheikh would have to he consulted and questions of accommodation etc. would arise. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baxter at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely,A'o T. 5 ■ If A (168/35/39) Britisn j^mbassy Bagdad.
