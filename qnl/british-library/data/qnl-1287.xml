A resume of this Jtevingram No.is enclosed. You will see that reference is made to the anti- British and anti-American rumours which have bebn emanating from the Middle East and which seem to start in one camp or other not so much out erf hostile feeling as out of an irresponsible inclination to pass on stories without the slightest pause to consider their probability or ascertain their truth. Your Mission has been asked to arrange at all levels a close system of contacts w:’th American opposite numbers. We understand that the same instructions will be issued to the U.S. Missions in your territory. When your office is called on to play its part, the form of machinery you choose for detecting and dis cussing the rumours will, we realise, depend upon local conditions; but in making your arrangements we would wish you constantly to bear in mind:- 1. That public denials tend to give fresh currency . to any rumour; far the better remedy is to cause dissemination of the true facts without reference to the rumour; and 2. That we look to you to combine with your American colleagues in using your skill to dissuade British and American Press Correspondents from sending home stories that will exacerbate feelings because they tell a tale that has not been checked.*.. . i|p 3. We might add that in our experience work of this kind is better done by frequent ad hoc meetings than by any rigid committee arrangements. A, 4Resume of No. 53 Saving. From : Foreign Office, To : Minister Resident Discussions have recently taken place between Foreign Office officials and American representatives on the subject of even closer co-ooeration between Great Britain and America in oolicy in the Middle East. It was recognised that the policies of both Great Britain and America must be influenced by their respective commitments and economic interests in the Middle East. The following more important points were raised during the discussion: 1. Egypt . The possibility of a change in the status . of the United States Diplomatic Mission in Cairo was discussed together with difficulties in connection with Lease Lend. 2* Ethiopia . Both governments agreed to co-operate in helping to re-establish a stable independent government in Ethiopia. 3* Palestine . It was agreed that agitation regarding Palestine, either in the country it self or in the United States of America, v/as seriously detrimental to the Mar Effort. A draft was discussed which might form the basis of a joint declaration by the two governments on the subject of Palestine which would be issued at a later date if the circumstances demanded it. Levant States . The American Delegation indicated that the United States Government was prepared to recognise the Levant States as soon as they had obtained an effective measure of independ ence. 5. Saudi Arabia . It v/as recognised that good re lations v/ith Saudi Arabia were of vital interest to both America, owing to the develop ment of her oil industry, and Britain, owing to this country*s proximity to vital sea and air communica tions, and its special position in the Moslem world, affecting large numbers of Moslems in the British Empire. The financial difficulties of Saudi Arabia were discussed . An agreed joint programme for furnishing supplies will be discussed further at the Middle East Supply Centre. Discussions on the more urgent problem of cur rency will be continued in Washington on a joint basis of consultation betv/een the two governments. In answer to Ibn Saud’s request to the British Government for Sunni Moslem T 'ilitary Advisors, it was suggested that a joint Anglo-American Military Mission should be offered which v/ould be under the2 command of a British Officer and consist partly of Americans ahd partly of Sunni Moslem Indians. No alteration was made in the arrangements for the provision of arms to Saudi Arabia. ( 6. Bahrein . The British Delegation agreed that the United States Consul in Dhahrahn should be enabled .to pay frequent visits to Bahrein to pro vide the Consular facilities required by the American community there without, however, the necessity for formal recognition or the issue of an exequatur. It was explained that to meet the special needs of the anticipated influx of oil company technicians and constructional workers, eight Special Constables of whom four were United States citizens, had been appointed by the Political Agent. -If necessary, further British personnel would be made available to act as Special Constables and further United States citizens could also be employed as Special Constables in the same way. In cases In which Americans are accused, the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure (which is applied to Bahrein) allows the Political Agent to sit with American assessors or with a jury which might include the majority of United States citizens. A United States Consul at Dhahrahn could also attend such cases as observer or assessor. The above arrangements will be further discussed in Washington^ Persia . It was agreed to suggest to the Soviet Government that conversations should be held between Allied representatives in Teheran, in order to implement more fully provisions in the Teheran Declaration regarding economic assistance for Persia. It was suggested that an agreed plan for the im provement of the Persian forces should be communicated to the Persian Authorities by the United States and British ambassadors, together with an undertaking to supply such equipment as would be required to carry out the plan. The Soviet Government should also be invited to supply similar proposals. 8. Afghanistan . The question of the supply of arms and equipment to Afghanistan was dis cussed, the British emphasising the special importance of this question with regard to India and expressing the earnest hope that the United States Government would enter into no commitment regarding the supply of arms to Afghanistan v/ithout prior consultation with the British Government. 9* Yemen . Delegates agreed in expressing hope that the Imam of the Yemen would accept the con ciliatory offer that had been made to him by the British Government for an amicable settlement of the frontier dispute.10 Middle East Supply Centre . The progress and future of the Middle East Supply Centre were discussed* In view of the out standing services performed by the joint Anglo-American Agency it ?7as agreed that every effort should be made to enable it to continue its work on a joint basis. 11. Anglo-American Relations in the liddle East . Attention has been dram to the difficulty of controlling reports of grievances and complaints when they reach Washington. A stream of quite minor complaints, can create a current of opinion in America bearing no relation to their intrinsic importance but which might be beyond the powers of governments to control. The question was discussed of providing machinery at all necessary levels whereby rumours, criticisms and complaints which might subsequently be ventilated nublicly should be raised frankly, jointly examined and disposed of immediately they arose.CONFIDENTIAL .

It vias cordially screed t v at in nrincinle t' ere wohld be rreat advantaye in hrinpinp about in the future an even closer co-oneration between British and American policy in the territories concerned, it was recopnised that the policy of His majesty's Government is inevitably influenced by their commitments for the adminis tration and defence of certain territories in the area. Similarly it was recopnised that the United States Government like His majesty's Government, have economic, interests in the Fiddle East^ which are bound to affect their policy. These special 'interests do not conflict, and there was rcneral agreement that Anplo-American relations in the area should be conducted on a basis of co-operation and of mutual frankness. nthe :omr unicated Wallace :.urrav a memorandum settinr British policy in v any of these countries 3, nmonr the more important points which arose in the course of discussions the following may be mentioned. EGYPT. Amonp points raised was the possibility of a chanpe in the status of the United Etates Diplomatic Fission at Cairo ( as at Baphdad ). Sir Maurice Petersoh said that there was no objection to this in principle but reserved his position for a future reply repardinr precedence in view of the treaty situation. There were also discussions repardinr difficulties which had been felt by both sides in connexion with Lease-Lend.^ILIOPJLi: A discussion too 1 : nlace on British policy ar\d inter ests in Athionia as explained in a paper of ‘which a cor ;7 was retained by the United Jtates Dederation. It T -. r as arreed that both Governments were interested in aidinr the re-establishment of a stable independent Government in Uthiopia and that there should be close consultation and co-operation between them for this ourpose. It was apreed that aritation rerardinr Palestine either in Palestine itself or In the United Gtates of America would be seriously detrimental to the war effort. Consideration was ^iven to a draft formula which wipht serve as a basis for a .ioint declaration by the two Governments on the subject of thilestine. It was agreed that f is draft should be held in reserve, and that its terms should be riven further consideration if develop ments in Palestine or elsewhere should seem to mahe a joint declaration/ desirable. LU /AP T J1AIAG- ' • Both aarties were agreed in attributing imnortance to the successful outcome of the negotiations initiated by General Catroux with the ^evant States for a modus vivend i for the conduct of their mutual relations. Ihe American Beleration indicated that the United States Government would be prepared to recopnise the Levant States as soon r,s they had attained in fact an effective measure of in dependence . SAUDI AKABIA . The interests of both parties in Saudi Arabia were explained and were mutually recopnised. The United States Government is principally concerned in the oil industry, which is beinp developed and extended. ? Relations with Saudi Arabia are British Commonwealth of Rations of importance to the because of its proximitv to vital sea and air communications, in view of Ibn Sand’s special Position as 'eeper of the , 'oslew Poly Places and on account 'of the pil^rimape which affects the larre numbers of Moslems in the British Umpire. The American Delepation accepted assurances riven by Sir.Paurice Peterson that there was not and never had been any intention on the part of His majesty’s Government to undermine or to prejudice American oil riphts in Saudi Arabia. The financial difficulties of Saudi Arabia were reviewed, and it was apreed that the question of furnishinr and paying for supplies 'to Saudi Arabia should be discussed further in Cairo through the Middle East Supply Centre with a view to working out an agreed joint programme'. As rerards the question of the currency, on which an urgent decision is needed, it was agreed that discussions would be continued in Uashington as quickly as possible. The American Delegation took note that Ibn Sand had requested His Majesty's Govern ment to provide a Sunni I oslem financial adviser. It was apreed that the larger financial and supply problems of Saudi Pirabia qupht to be dealt with as far as possible on a joint basis in consultation between the two Governments. As regards a similar request from Ibn Gaud to Hid Majesty' Government to furnish Sunni Moslem military advisers, it -was suggested by the British Delegation that Ibn Saud should be off erred, a joint Anglo-American military ' mission composed partly of American and partly of Sunni .oslem Indian Officers the head of the mission to be a British officer. Details would be worked out as soon as possible, r allace Murrayr in said he. would consult the ./ar Departnent in »/ashinrton and reply to this sup^estion as soon as possible. The joint arrangement for the provision of arms to Jaudi Arabia by the two Governments were reviewed and it was agreed to leave the situation as it stood. dA Lin I h The British Delegation aoreed that the United Btates Consul in Dharan should be enabled to nay frequent visits to Bahrain to provide the consular facilities required by the American community there without, however, the necess ity for formal recornition or the issue of an exequator. It was explained that, to meet the special needs of the anticipated exceptional influx of oil cowmany technicians and constructional worhers, elrht special constables, df whom four were United States citizens, had been appointed by the Political Trent. If necessary further British personnel # ~n] I be r ode voidable to act as special con stables and further United States citizens could also be employed as special constables in the same way. In cases in which Americans are accused, the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure ( which is applied in Bahrein) allows the Poli tical Ayent to sit with American assessors or with a jury which miyht include a majority of united states citizens. The United States Consul at Dhahran could also attend such cases as observer or assessor. The United Sates Deleration expressed their thanks for the arranyements suyyested and said they would discuss them with the State Depart 'ent Leyal Adviser on their return to Uashinrton. PSRSIA. It was a 'reed, on the proposal of hr. ./allace hurray, to surpest to the Soviet Government that conversations should be held between Allied representatiyes in Tehran with a view to implemertiny more fully the provisions of the Tehran declaration rerardinr economic assistance for Persia. oir laurice Peterson communicated a note on the of the supply of equipment to the Persi yestiny that an agreed plan for the inn forces should be communicated to the Pe the United States and British Ambassado with an undertakinr' to sup ^ly such equi rerwired to carry out this Plan.

Both Delegations agreed that their aim was to help and encourage Persia in her efforts to be stable, prosperous and secure, and that to this end the American advisers should be actively supported in their difficult task. rpf 1 Tf '\ T 'T T i T 1 A T-T n.xVjix-.-v Sir I:auric*e Peterson communicated a note rerardinr the- supply of arms and equipment to Afghanistan.

The progress and future' of the Middle hast.Junply Centre •vere discussed with assistance of experts on both sides. It was ayreed that this .Mint A-nrlo-American ayency had performed outstandiny services to the Middle hastern peoples in aidiny them to face, t'.e yreat economic nrobler s of the war. hvery effort should be made, by the nrovision of a -staff and other wise, to enable it to continue its work on a ioint basis, as war-time barriers and restrictions are relaxed aM abolished the economic problems of the area will alter, bnt many of them will remain common to a lar r *e part of the Middle hast. ±t was ayreed that the Middle Eastern Governments should if possible be drawn yradually into closer association with the Centre so that they may be aided to co-operate vr ith each other and nrovided with general and technical yuidance for dealiny with their common social and economic problems and for raisiny the standard of livinr and health throughout the Middle East. ,’ihile it was recoynised that the nature of British and American narticipation must be left 'or subservient considera tion it was agreed that the ultimate objective should be the development of an autonomous economic institution serviny the neonles of the fiddle fast and operated and supnofcted by them.

It Wos ayreed that such noints ou Ait if -ossible to be dealt with on the snot and at once in a spirit of mutual under standing and co-operation, and that it would e well to send telerrams to ord Moyne and 1 r.

The military and supply authorities of the two countries would be actively encouraged to do the same. (copies sent to Mr. Wiltshire).FAST AIR MAIL. h/i India Office, White Hall, S.W.I., 17th June, 1944, Dear Prior, f Would you please refer to the last paragraph of F.O. Saving telegram No* 53 to the Minister Resident at Cairo, a copy of which wasaent to you on 8th May under our Ext. 1960/ 44, regarding the discussions here on the Middle East with Wallace Murray. c X I I now enclose a copy of F.O. Saving telegram No. 54, which it is regeetted was not by an oversight brought to our attention earlier, regarding the devising of machingry locally to ensure that all minor complaints and g rievances arising with the Americans shouldqso far as possible be settled on the spot. rt hile these instructions cannot of course apply to the Persian Gulf area in quite the sameray as they do to those diplomatic posts to which the telegram is addressed, nevertheless occasions for contact with American representatives arise from time to time and this is likely particularly to be the case in Bahrein now that a U.S. Consul is to be appointed at ^hahran with the responsibility of looking after tie interests of American citizens in Bahrein. We shall be glad therefore if you will examine what can be done in the Persian Gulf area to secure the largest possible measure of co-operation with the Americans on the lines suggested, and will issue appropriate instructions to the Political Agents at Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat. I am to invite special a ttention to paragraph 4 of Telegram Saving No.54, which emphasises the importance attached by H.M.G. to this matter. I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe.

My telegram No. 63 Saving of April 29th* fttiglo- American discussions regarding the Twiddle East. It Is now necessary to consider how we can apply in the Middle East itself the principle of Anglo-American co operation and of community of intersts which ms the nainAgreed conclusion of the discussions with Mr. Wallace Murray. ' His Majesty 1 s Ambassador Washington has drawn attention to the difficulty of controlling reports of grievances and complafrits when they Teach Washington and Mr. Wallace Murray himself spoke seriously at the last meeting at the Foreign Office of the danger of a stream of quite minor complaints creating a current of opinion ill America bearing no relation to their instrinsic importance, but which it might be beyond the power of Governments to control. As you will see from the last paragraph of the agreed minute in my telegram under reference, it was agreed that machinery should be devised locally at all necessary levels, so that all such complaints and grievances should so far as possible be raised frankly, examined jointly and settled on the spot. Telegrams for this purpose would, it was agreed, be sent to you and to British diplomatic Representatives in the Middle East. Mf. Wallace Murray said that he would do his best to get corresponding instructions sent to Mr. Landis and to the United Skites diplomatic Representatives concerned on his return to Washington. The military and supply authorities of the two countries would be actively encouraged to do the same. 2. I am encouraged by the admirable work which the M.E. S.C. in general and Commander Jackson in particular have been able to achieve in this direction, to believe that much improve -raent could be effected if more co-operation in remedying com plaints could be arranged locally, especially on technical levels. Obviously we stand to suffer just as much from a non-co-operatige attitude or from unresolved g rievances and complaints on the part of representatives of Ufcited States Treasury, Army or F.E.A. as from direct diplomatic intervent ions by American diplomatic missions. United States Govern' -ment Departments do not seem to be so closely linked with each other as ours and this is an additional reason for arranging direct contacts at technical levels.- 2 - 3 # On receipt of t&gt;is telegram, will you and His Majesty •s diplomatic Representatives to whom it is addressed there fore please forthwith examine the whole field of affairs in which British and American authorities in the various parts of the Middle East operate, and endeavour to arrange, as soon as Jiiited States representatives receive the necessary instructions, a regular and close system of contacts, or if necessary, committees, as the local situation may ddmand and at t he lowest practicable level, with a view to examining and, if possible eliminating all sources of friction that may arise. The same applies to the press? this is harder to deal with, but I would suggest ^hat you should arrange for the censorship authorities tiiroughout the Middle East to report all complaints sent by American correspondents and that they should immediately be examined and that if possible similar publicity should be giv&amp;n to the result. If you and United States authorities could persuade correspond -ents not to report complaints until these have been investig ated so touch the better. 4. I attach the greatest importance to cur making a determined effort to prevent this stream of complaints coming back to London and Washington and to endeavour to improve co-operation on the spot. 5* Please pass a copy to High Commissioner Jerusalem.
