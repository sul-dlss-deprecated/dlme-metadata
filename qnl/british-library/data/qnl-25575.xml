His Highness has been much impressed with a threat sent by Major Demare that if he does not join nationalist party or leave the country all nis properties in west Persia will be destroyed. He has en quired of Russian Minister and me whether our Govern ments would indemnify him if threat is carried out which is quite probable, A signal Russian success at Ramadan would restore some measure of confidence to Cabinet but at present they are so much impressed by threats of Germans and gendarmes that they scarcely dare talk even of an alliance and we can get nothing definite from them as to completed demands.

Sir:- f ) Iu con ' t, i nu ation of my despatch Poll 7 dated 26th June I have the honour to bring to your notice the following additional facts with regard to Major pravitz. In the first place the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia here has infomed me privately and confi dentially L-^au during his stay of six months or so at dhiraz Major Pravitz made the following remittances through his private banking account; Telegraphic through London to Sweden £550 Drafts on London £119.10.0. Letter of credit ,2880. 0.0. £1549.10.0. To Tehran to his debit in private account either to Major Enden or L’uval Krans 84590 at say 60 £1410. 0.0. Total £2959.10.0. It is possible that these latter remittances may have had some connexion with the official gendarmerie account, though it is difficult to understand why in this case they should have passed through 1 ajor pravitz’ private account; out the first hatch of transactions would appear to have been purely private remittances, and to show that 1 ajor pravitz during his six months here succeeded in amassing some £15 uu on a salary of £6QO a year or so. His Britannic majesty* s minister, It Tehran.It- 1b, I venture to think, impossible that this oificer aiould again be entrusted with the administration 01 tue i ' ars W ( 'Siment of uendaimerie, more especially if -Jie entails the handling of British money, until he has given a full and satisfactory explanation of those transactions. The matter is one which might, as I ventun to think, be referred to the nwedi* Government as toucning uie honour and reputation of one of their officers. secondly I enclose for Your Excellency’s infoxma- tion a copy of an official letter dated 8th April last from major Pravitz to the Finance Agent at Shiraz, at tne end of which appears the threat vfoich 1 mentioned in ipy despatch ho. 17. This language (which was repeated on other occasions both in private and official letters) was consonance with Major pravitz * general attitude during tue last two or three months of his service here, he openly bullied and menaced the Finance Agent and his subordinates, aid seized money and grain by force. He deliberately lied to me regarding the gendarmerie expedi tion to Kazaroon, and totally disregarded tne advice which I gave him regarding the Kamarij affair - with the result that robberies nave since occurred on tne road and British firms have suffered heavy losses, /aid he openly connived at tne scandalous pro-Geircan intrigues of his Persian officers, regarding wnicn i frequently warned him and protested. 1 venture to hope, therefore, that Your Excellency will insist that Major pravitz should not be allowed to return to Pars (and indeed I would suggest to any part of Persia) in any capacity. I have reason to know from telegrams which I have seen passing between the Swedish officers here end at Tehran that some of these officers themselvesthemselves suspect and distrust iiajor Pravitz; and as uiese officers projese to oe very jealous of their honour and good name, i believe that they would much prefer that hajor pravitz should remain in Sweden than tnat a disagreeable scandal should be provoked by his return to Persia. I may add here that I nave received at different times from the Finance Agents here copies of their 'objections 1 ’ and 'observations* regarding the gendarmerie accounts during the last two years. These accounts dis play such an amazing array of irregularities that a mere nint at their publication, or their ccmmunication to the Swedish Government, should be sufficient to*bring the Swedish officers to their senses at once. To take only one instance, Major Lundoerg, when 'intendant' of the gendarmerie, fed his pet wild pigs at the expense of the Persian Government (on borrowed British money) for several months, and the cost of their food, on a regular scale of diet, was regularly entered in the accounts. This fact (which is only one of hundreds almost equally scandalous) has been duly brought to the notice of the Persian Government, but it is apparently the policy of that Government to take no notice at present ol such, irregularities. But i am of opinion that if once the popular feeling in favour of the Swedish officers shows signs of cooling down, such facts as these will be brought to light, and will con stitute a very striking revelation not only of the character of the Swedish officers themselves, but also of the character and attitude of the Persian Government.

With reference to my telegram to your address, No. 145, dated 15th May last, I have the honour to forward herewith copies of two letters, both dated 8th May, addressed to me by Major Pravitz, who was at that time Commandant of the Regiment of Gendarmerie in Pars. ' On receipt of the first of these two letters I consulted Mr. Ferguson, the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Shiraz, and sent a civil reply to Major Pravitz, explaining how it was that the hank did not, as a matter of business, desire to purchase his gold ; hut that they were prepared, in order to oblige him, to accept it at 50 Krans per £1. In reply to this letter I received the extraordinary communication, of which I enclose a copy II, threatening the bank with exposure in “ eventual interviews ” (presumably with representatives of the Swedish Press), and then admitting that the gold had been purchased from Herr Wassmuss—4he ex- German Consul who is now carrying on an open and flagrant campaign in Pars directed against British interests and the neutrality of this country. I replied briefly to this letter saying that now that Major Pravitz had informed me that the gold had been purchased from Herr Wassmuss, the bank would not, of course, have anything to do with it on any terms, and expressing regret that Major Pravitz should have assisted Herr Wassmuss in his propaganda against our interests and the neutrality of Persia by purchasing his gold from him. And I added that there was no international law, as he supposed, 'whereby the bank was obliged to purchase English gold in Persia. Without entering into the general question of the Swedish officers and their abilities and character in this letter, I venture to submit these letters for Your Excellency’s consideration with special reference to Major Pravitz who, as no doubt Your Excellency is aware, has now returned to Sweden on leave with the intention of rejoining his post at Shiraz later on. Major Pravitz, on his first arrival at Shiraz, created a good impression as a hard-headed and hard-working officer, and he appeared anxious to conduct the affairs of the gendarmerie in a more business like manner than had been usual with his predecessors. He soon, however, fell under the influence of his native officers (who have been the curse and the stumbling block of all the Swedish officers from the beginning), began to dabble in politics and intrigue and assumed a bullying tone in his correspondence with other depart ments. He twice threatened the Finance Agent here with exposure to “ the people ” and to the gendarmerie a most improper threat and quite inexcusable in the circumstances prevailing here at the time; and his telegram to the Resident at Bushire, couched in the language of an ultimatum, has already been reported to Your Excellency. In many other respects his conduct has been unsatisfactory, and on more than one occasion he has deliberately lied to me regarding suspicious movements of the gendarmerie, &amp;c.^ And I more than suspect him of being privy to and assisting the German intrigues.

In the circumstances, during the present war, it seems to me hardly to be supposed that the corps will behave in a genuinely neutral manner towards us, whatever assurances the Commandant and other officers may give us. On the other hand, were the gendarmerie in the South to be removed or to melt away, it might be possible, when the war is over, .to get Russia and the Persian Government to agree to a gendarmerie with British officers in the South. The immediate result of the disappearance of the gendarmerie would most probably be robberies and raids on the road, but with the help of Sow let and Kawam and by subsidizing the Khans, this ought to be kept within limits, at a great deal less expenditure than would be incurred in bolstering up the gendarmerie. In any case, what with German activities and pro-Turkish intrigues, it looks as if Persia is in for a period ot anarchy until the end of the war* gendarmerie or no gendarmerie.

Following from His Majest 3 ^ f s Representative at Shiraz 191. Begins. Disorderly state of Shiraz and neighbourhood is becoming daily more serious. There are constant robberies in and around town. Armenians are being threatened and assaulted. Situation in town was critical yesterday and serious trouble was only averted by gendarmerie under orders from Pousette. It is becoming increasingly evident that - only force to be relied on for maintenance of order both here and on road is gendarmerie and I again venture to urge that if His Majesty 1 s Government desire to have peace and order maintained in Southern Persia it will be necessary to provide funds for gendarmerie as already proposed. Men have been nearly 3 months without pa}/ and early decision is necessary. To avoid delay I suggest that His Majesty 1 s Government should authorise Your Excellency to expend say 50,000 on upkeep of gendarmerie in Pars for one year money to he disbursed from time to time as reouired on demand of oi.icer CoitnBnding (at) Shiraz addressed to British Consul. This would avoid any formalities with Persian Government and would make gendarmerie practically dependent on us. If proposal approved I would submit further suggestions regarding accounts etc. Addressed Tehran: repeated Bushire.'ff ■] : [This Document is the Property .of His Britaimic Majesty’s Government] [July 1.] Section 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived July 1.) (No. 86.) Sir, Tehran, June 10, 1915. THERE can be little doubt that one of the factors that have enabled the German propaganda in Persia to gain so strong a hold on popular sentiment has been the attitude of the Swedish gendarmerie officers, and yet I am nearly convinced from the conversations I have had with some of them that they have been until recently quite unaware of the responsibility they must bear for the present state of affairs in Persia. Taking ail the circumstances of the case attending the position of the Swedes into account, it seems to me that this result was almost inevitable. On their arrival they soon saw, and indeed it must have been impressed upon them, that if their task was to be successfully carried on they must make their own personality felt, or, in other words, disregard in a very large measure the orders they might receive from the Persian authorities, and the result has been the creation of a disciplined force scattered over the most important trade routes and centres of Persia, practically independent of the Persian Government, and at the sole orders of the Swedes. They have received the financial support of ourselves and the Russians, and have learnt to spend lavishly, and when our subventions failed have on one or two occasions forcibly appropriated Govern ment funds destined for other purposes. They have thus acquired an immense prestige in the eyes of the natives. ■ _ . . When the war broke out the Swedes had a bond of sympathy with the Persians m their dislike of Russia, and very naturally expressed their confidence, or at least their hope, that Russia would be defeated by the vast military power of Germany, and so the ground was prepared for the seed of the Turco-German propaganda. Ihe Swedes also were very industriously cultivated by the German Legation, and when the German agents, who now overrun so large a part of Persia, arrived, what more natural than that the Swedes should give assistance to their friends’ friends by facilitating their journeys, providing escorts, &amp;c. Escorts, it must be remembered, are provided nr dangerous districts by the gendarmerie to any European who may demand it, and with therr wrsh to be friendly, the Swedes without doubt have been sometimes, but not, I concede, by any means always,! very useful auxiliaries to the German agents. In t e case of Prince Reuss XXXL and M. Logotheti, their good offices converted therr Excellencies journey in a sort of royal progress, but rn the crrcumstances, R was hard for them as neutrals to refuse every assistance to forergn diplomats, and Major de are, who had travelled all the way from Constantinople with the Austrran and German representatives, realising that it behoved him not to be too close y r err r e v r em, left his companions at Bagdad so as to save appearances. T re resu was no v ra re had intended ; for he was looked upon as a sort of courier sent fo ma e arrangemen s for the reception of the German and Austrian representatives—which he undoubted y did. Still there does not seem to be anything in what they did to which serious exception could be taken, had the circumstances been normal but the Swedes are still very young in Persian experience and their lack of capacitv to understand the effect which their intimacy with the Germans and Turks and their incautious language about the war would produce on Ihe native mind has only too oiten led them into mdisci of word and deed. „ „ . . . r v, OC! , r£ir xr Wassmuss has been particularly successful in making use of th ®“, I'M M considerable influence with the Gernmnophde Governor of Shiraz, a nd tWe can be , o doubt that he has employed it to induce Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh to call on the gendaru e to take action against the local Khans in whose welfare we are interested. Then when an expedition of this kind was decided on, what more natural than that Consul Wassmuss, finding the business— commercial, of course—takes him in the same 'region should accompany his Swedish friend. This is the way in which the Swedes represen their action, and it is a plausible enough defence. „ , , t ften But I fear that it is beyond question that in the south the Swedes hare too ott been actuated by a feeling of pique agai nst ourselves m tbV' . jT' 'frbf ifTIte their German friends. Again, this feeling s ‘ems-tu iilb U ha.b had ^.s or 0 ‘1 [2454 a —1] Copy to India 23 JUL19152 mtural cause3 As I have already said, the Swedes very soon learnt to think they had no masters and when they were invited by ourselves to carry out their work m the no masters, ana wnen n j ^ ]_r; g Ma esty s consular officers m these southern being exerted in directions 7 not always compatible with ! ou g r interest' Our interests were of course, bound up primarily in the maintenance t;/ orde'^buTit will readily be understood that the Swedes -few of whom know Persian^ havdn' to depend for local knowledge on their Persian officers, were often led to conclusions and brought into conflict with the policy of His Majesty s consu s. er Z outbreak of war this divergence of views developed, from causes I have already endeavoured to describe in the Earlier part of this despato^ mto ^ which while it has been quite perceptible on the part of the Swedes themselves, has I shown itself most markedly in the conduct of the Persian officers. Several incidents, and one in particular at Bushire, have shown how widespread is this anti-British feeling I among the latter and in some cases the Swedes have shown unmistakable inclination | to attach credence to their native officers’ reports rather than to ours, and even to back 1 UP ‘ There have also been other causes contributory to the unsatisfactory attitude of the Swedes such as the blame attached to them over the Kazeroun affair and the accusation published in the British press on official authority of their having connived at the smu* of arms in German interests. There can be no doubt that, as regards the first' the Swedish officers’ behaviour was most discreditable, but in the second mcii en I am quite convinced that a hasty conclusion was formed from imperfectly known facts, and the Swedes were quite guiltless of the charge. At all events the arms in question are now in Tehran in the possession of the gendarmerie. Of late, however, the Swedes have appeared to realise that they have as regards their relations with the Germans, been extremely indiscreet to say the least ol it and they are likely to be much more careful in the future to preseiwe themselves even from an appearance of partiality. Nevertheless it is to be anticipated that the attitude of S the Swedish officers towards us will continue. It is not likely to &gt; exhibit itself m so marked a degree or with so unfortunate results as during the war, out even after peace is concluded I feel convinced that their disposition not to recognise the predominance of our interests and influence in southern Persia will still continue. The question thus arises, what is to be our attitude towards these officers.^ I have not, of course forgotten that His Maiesty s Government and that of Russia decided three months ago that they must be removed from Persia, hut of late M. de Etter and I have thought it wiser not to press the question for the reason that, thanks to the anti-Russian attitude ol the Swedes, they have become very popular with the Majlis and the pro-German elemen s in Persia, and to have insisted on their withdrawal might have_ embarrassed Ain-ed- Dowleh’s Cabinet. Moreover, their attitude has been more satisfactory of late, and they profess themselves to be quite ready to carry out all orders from the Government, even should these orders involve action against their German friends; indeed, in one or two instances they have done something to make good those professions. I he above-mentioned decision of the Governments was arrived at—on our part at all events in consequence of the pro-German proclivities and activity of the Swedes, and was precipitated, il my memory is not at fault, by the story ol arms smuggling m German interests, a story which, as before said,_ I believe to be quite unfounded on lack In the circumstances, therefore, a change of attitude on our part towards the Swe is officers would be easily explained. I believe that, with few exceptions, they will m future be very much more careful to observe a neutral attitude both in word and deed, and more amenable to the orders of the Persian Government, through whom I think it should be possible to secure that the Swedes shall not be able to push their unques tionably anti-British feeling in purely Persian local affairs to any dangerous extent. The risk of Persia being thrust into a state of war against us is now remote, Government of whatever complexion would allow Turco-German influence to carry them so far. and the only possible manner in which such an event could be brought about would seem to be by some local act of violence of such gravity that we and^ our Allies could not condone it. The Swedes in their chastened spirit can he counted on not to precipitate such an incident, but rather to prevent it. It must not be forgotten that the disappearance of the Swedes will be followed, in a very short interval, by a return to the deplorable conditions of insecurity on the roads, &amp;c , that obtained three years ago, if indeed things would not be very much worse ; and I submit that, unless my iudo-ment as to the probable behaviour of the Swedish officers is entirely at fault, i would be to our interest, as well as to that of Persia, to retain them in south Persia and more particularly in Ears until the conclusion of peace, or until it is convenient to us todeal with the question afresh. As ,to the north of Persia, the matter is one which concerns Russian interests rather more than our own, hut M. de Etter informs 'me that at present he is disposed to think tha/t the force should be maintained. 'A His Majesty s consul at Shiraz has recently informed me by telegraph that Captain If Pousette, who is now in command there, is seriously concerned as to the outlook of the gendarmerie from a financial standpoint and is demanding the imposition of a tax on animals to meet the requisite expenditure, failing which he would march the Ears regiment to Tehran as a demonstration. The gendarmerie in that province, so I learnt from Major Pravitz, who called on me on his way to Sweden on three months’ leave, have been paid up to the end of May, so that the need of money is not so urgent as I have hitherto been led to suppose, but there are certain arrears dating from rather more than a year back, which amount to 60,000 tomans (12,00oL) in round figures. The want of money is, however, likely to be felt in an acute form very shortly, and in the present embarrassed condition of the Persian Treasury it appears to me very certain that, except under very strong pressure from us, the means will not he found to provide the necessary funds; in that event I understand that the Swedish officers, who are not particularly enamoured of their work here, will be quite ready to resign provided that their salaries, &amp;c. are paid. It would therefore seem that it rests with us whether the gendarmerie in Ears is maintained or not; and that if at any moment we decide against them, we have only to remain passive, and the force will melt away for lack of funds to carry it on. I am well aware that the opinion held by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire is that the Swedish officers have shown themselves consistently disinclined to recognise our paramount influence in the southern provinces, and since the war (^ye)have openly abetted the agents of the German Legation in their efforts to injure our interests and prestige in every possible way, and that therefore it is our best policy, even at the risk of seeing the whole of the south of Persia fall into a condition of anarchy, to bring about the recall of the Swedish officers, and that to endeavour to maintain them is merely to throw good money after bad. Indeed I have just received a telegram from Major Trevor strongly advising this course. But in my opinion the better course for us, as I have said before, will be to retain the Swedes, at all events until the end of the war. If, as I believe, they have now recognised the immense harm they have done to Persia and to their own credit in our eyes by their pro-German attitude, there is at least a good probability that they will succeed in maintaining some degree of tranquillity, which is surely a reasonable set-off against a temporary continuation of the anti-British Swedish proclivities, and even supposing that my belief in their change of attitude is falsified by events the worst that can happen is that the Germans may succeed in bringing about the state of chaos which must occur if they are wuthdrawn. As to the prospect of this contingency which the Germans are apparently endeavouring to achieve, by creating a coalition against us among the tribes of Ears, I must confess to entertaining great scepticism. Most Persians and many Europeans in a position to form a useful judgment dende the mere idea, but in the face of the evident apprehensions entertained by His Majesty s consular representatives at Bushire, Shiraz, and Ispahan, I am not prepare to say' tpat the thing is impossible. That the attempt is being seriously made cannot be denied, but I am quite certain that the Persian Government is doing what A can to thwart the German efforts, and will, with our support, in all probability succeed m aoing so, and A would, I submit, be a mistake for us to bring about the disbandment of the gendarmerie which is already showing itself much more obedient to the Government than at any other period in its existence, and which would prove itself a very useful instrument m the hands of the Minister of the Interior. . . , m i + If His Maiesty’s Government should concur m the view that A would be to om policy to maintain the gendarmerie of Pars by means of financial support for the duration of the war, or until such time as we may find it convenient to make other arrangements for carrying on its work, the simplest wa) won appear o p • the event of His Majesty’s Government consenting to agree to giving the Persian Government financial Lpport, a certain monthly sum. should be earmarked ^ purposes of the Pars regiment, or failing any such agre^eme^ S should be made wlich would of course be terminable at our pleasure but in any arrangement that might be made, we should have to stipulate for the transfer elsewhere of any officer, Swedish or Persian, whom we might designate at any time as shov mg m 5 °^'rtTe above I have received a further telegram from Major OVonnor which he expresses strong dissent from the views entertained oy His Majes.ys r- -.1 B 2 [2449 a —2]4 i 1 „ t Ttimhire and urges that, provided that the eventuality of Persia “ a ?'° b *“'' ”■ as well as one from Major Trevor. chIrles m. marling v&gt; Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Further, should the regiment disperse, this would remove a trained body of men, who might give considerable trouble m the south in the event of Persia joining in the war. When the gendarmerie first came south, the German consul under instructions from his legation at once began to get round the Swedish officers {vide Sir P. Cox’s telegtam No. 443, of November 1913). For some time past it has been evident that the Germans have been completely successful and have absolutely “ nobbled ” the gendarmerie. In these circumstances during the present* war it seems to me hardly to be supposed that the corps will behave m a genuinely neutral manner towards us, whatever assurances the commandant and other officers give us. On the other hand were the gendarmerie in the south to be removed or to melt away, it might he possible when the war is over to get Russia and the Persian Government°to agree to a gendarmerie with British officers for the south. The immediate result of. the disappearance of the gendarmerie would be very probably robbers and raiders on the roads, but with the help of Soulet and Kawam and by subsidising the kans this ought to be kept within the limits and at a great deal less expenditure than would be incurred in bolstering up the gendarmerie. In any case what with the German activities and intrigues of pro-Turks, &amp;c., it looks as if Persia is in for a period of anarchy till the end of the war, gendarmerie or no gendarmerie.

If such eventuality seems' at all likely, I venture to express agreement with Major Trevor’s views that the sooner the gendarmerie disappears the better, and that we should do nothing further to support them. If, however, Persian participation in the war is improbable or even uncertain, I venture to dissent strongly from Bushire point of view^ which appears to me to take into account rather the interests ol Bushire than those of Pars, and so of South Persia as a whole. •In spite of all their faults and failings, which I fully realise and admit, it cannot be denied that the gendarmerie have preserved South Persia from anarchy, during the last two vears and have kept the roads open for commerce, posts, and travellers. Such a situation is, I venture to think, infinitely more beneficial to oui interests than a state of chaos which might compel us to intervene and which might involve _ us^ m serious embarassments of many kinds. During the last few days 1 have been bringing very strong pressure to bear on Captain Poussette with regard to the question o neutrality,^Ac.

He suggests that to ensure economy officer commanding should present estimates each month to the financial agent, who would discuss them with His Majesty’s consul and settle the proportion to be furnished from local revenues and by His Majesty’s Government respectively, and that I should then be empowered to give authorisation for money to be advanced by Imperial Bank of Persia. Am I to understand that the subvention would be in the nature of gift to Persian Government or an advance ? Disadvantage of the latter form is that if it is independent of advance contemplated in my telegram No. 2[? 05] sanction of Medjliss would be required, and it would be difficult to obtain [group undecypherable : ? acceptable] control of expenditure, while if it is to be taken out of that advance value of the latter will be greatly diminished in the eyes of the Persian Government.

(s’M Section 2.\ [87732] No. 1. 0 Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey—(Received July 1.) (No. 86.) Sir, Tehran, June 10, 1915. THERE can be little doubt that one of the factors that have enabled the German propaganda in Persia to gain so strong a hold on popular sentiment has been the attitude of the Swedish gendarmerie officers, and yet I am nearly convinced from the conversations I have had with some of them that they have been until recently quite unaware of the responsibility they must bear for the present state of affairs in Persia. Taking all the circumstances of the case attending the position of the Swedes into account, it seems to me that this result was almost inevitable. On their arrival they soon saw, and indeed it must have been impressed upon them, that if their task was to be successfully carried on they must make their own personality felt, or, in other words, disregard in a very large measure the orders they might receive from the Persian authorities, and the result has been the creation of a disciplined force scattered over the most important trade routes and centres of Persia, practically independent of the Persian Government, and at the sole orders of the Swedes. They have received the financial support of ourselves and the Russians, and have learnt to spend lavishly, and when our subventions failed have on one or two occasions forcibly appropriated Govern ment funds destined for other purposes. They have thus acquired an immense prestige in the eyes of the natives. . . AVhen the war broke out the Swedes had a bond of sympathy with the Persians in their dislike of Russia, and very naturally expressed their confidence, or at least their hope that Russia would be defeated by the vast military power ol Germany, and so t e ground was prepared for the seed of the Turco-German propaganda. Ihe Swedes also were very industriously cultivated by the German Legation, and when the German ao-ents who now overrun so large a part of Persia, arrived, what more natural than that the Swedes should give assistance to their friends’ friends by facilitating their journeys, providing escorts, &amp;c. Escorts, it must be remembered, are provided m dangerous districtsliy the gendarmerie to any European who may demand it, and with their wish to be friendly, the Swedes without doubt have been sometimes, but not, I concede, by any •means' always,! very useful auxiliaries _to the German agents. In ^ of Prince Reuss XXXI. and M. Logotheti, their good offices converted their Excellencies journey in a sort of royal P™g ress ’ but m for them as neutrals to refuse every assistance to foreign diplomats, and Major de who had travelled all the way from Constantinople with the Austrian and German reoresentatives, realising that it behoved him not to be too ’ left his companions at Bagdad so as to save appearances. The result was not what he had intended ; for he was looked upon as a sort of courier sent to make arrangements for the recention of the German and Austrian representatives—which he undoubtedly dh Stffl Lre does not seem to be anything in what ^ey dU to whmh senons exception could be taken, had the circumstances been n ^™Ao ^&lt;^8^ the effect very vounfr in Persian experience and then lack of capacity to understand the eaect whfch their intimacy with the Germans and Turks and ^-^'^ISetion the war would produce on (he native mind has only too otten led them into indisci ° f W0 Was”nutrL been particularly successful in making use of He^s^ery an expedition of this kind was d 601 ^; P^^TtekeThiTin ^he samelirection.

Again, this feeling seems to me to have had on„in ^ q2 natural causes As I have already said, the Swedes very soon learnt to think they had no masters and when they were invited by ourselves to carry out then work m the southern^prOTinces, it Js not. long before oX but it Will readily be understood that the Swedes few of whom know Persian, EfeSfSntIT 1 MgrafS X' ? £”m'S '» X'Z“ofXhi. di,.rg*n&lt;» Of ,i.w. d..0lop.d, torn pausos I W, droody to attach credence to their native officers’ reports rather than to ours, and even to bac up their “tmm ^ contributory t the unsat ;sfactory attitude of the Swedes such as the blame attached to them over the Kazeroun affair and the accusation published in the British press on official authonty of their having connive ^at t e smucra-liue of arms in Gennan interests. There can be no doubt that, as regards the first” the Swedish officers’ behaviour was most discreditable, but m the second incident I am quite convinced that a hasty conclusion was formed from imperfectly known facts, and the Swedes were quite guiltless of the charge. At all events the arms in question are now in Tehran in the possession of the gendarmerie. Of late, however, the Swedes have appeared to realise that they have as regards their relations with the Germans, been extremely indiscreet to say the least of it, and they are likely to be much more careful in the future to preserve themselves even from, an appearance of partiality. Nevertheless it is to be anticipated that the attitude of the Swedish officers towards us will continue. It is not likely to exhibit itself marked a degree or with so unfortunate results as during the war, but even after peace is concluded I feel convinced that their disposition not to recognise the predominance of our interests and influence in southern Persia will still continue The question thus arises, what is to be our attitude towards these officers I have not, of course forgotten that His Majesty’s Government and that of Kussia decided three months ago that they must be removed from Persia, but of late M. de Etter and I have thought it wiser not to press the question for the reason that, thanks to the anti-Bussian attitude of t e Swedes, they have become very popular with the Majlis and the pro-German elemen s in Persia, and to have insisted on their withdrawal might have embarrassed Am-ed- Dowleh’s Cabinet. Moreover, their attitude has been more satisfactory of late, and they profess themselves to be quite ready to carry out all orders from the Government, even should these orders involve action against their German friends; indeed, in one or two instances they have done something to make good those professions. Ihe above-mentioned decision of the Governments was arrived_ at—on &lt;-&gt; ur P ar t at a11 events—in consequence of the pro-German proclivities and activity of the bwedes, and was precipitated, if my memory is not at fault, by the story of arms smuggling m German interests, a story which, as before said,_ I believe to he quite unfounded on iact In the circumstances, therefore, a change of attitude on our part towards the bwedis officers would be easily explained. I believe that, with few exceptions, they will m future be very much more careful to observe a neutral attitude both m word and deed, and more amenable to the orders of the Persian Government, through whom 1 think i should be possible to secure that the Swedes shall not be able to push their unques tionably anti-British feeling in purely Persian local affairs to any dangerous exten . The risk of Persia being thrust into a state of war against us is now remote. JNo Government of whatever complexion would allow Turco-German influence to carry them so far. and the only possible manner in which such an event could he brought abou would seem to be by some local act of violence of such gravity that we and our Ames could not condone it. The Swedes in their chastened spirit can be counted on not o precipitate such an incident, hut rather to prevent it. It must not be forgotten tha the disappearance of the Swedes will be followed, in a very short interval, by a return to the deplorable conditions of insecurity on the roads, &amp;c . that obtained three years ao’o if indeed things would not be very much worse ; and I submit that, unless my iudgment as to the probable behaviour of the Swedish officers is entirely at fay , i would be to our interest, as well as to that of Persia, to retain them in south Persia and more particularly in Pars until the conclusion of peace, or until it is convenient to us odeal with the question afresh. As jto the north of Persia, the matter is one which concerns Russian interests rather more than our own, but M. de Etter informs me that at present he is disposed to think that the force should be maintained. His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz has recently informed me by telegraph that Captain Pousette, who is now in command there, is seriously concerned as to the outlook of the gendarmerie from a financial standpoint and is demanding the imposition of a tax on animals to meet the requisite expenditure, failing which he would march the Ears regiment to Tehran as a demonstration. The gendarmerie in that province, so I learnt from Major Pravitz, who called on me on his way to Sweden on three months’ leave, have been paid up to the end of May, so that the need of money is not so urgent as I have hitherto been led to suppose, but there are certain arrears dating from rather more than a year back, which amount to 60,000 tomans (12,00uZ.) in round figures. ^ The want of money is, however, likely to be felt in an acute form very shortly, and in the present embarrassed condition of the Persian Treasury it appears to me very certain that, except under very strong pressure from us, the means will pot he found to provide the necessary funds; in that event I understand that the Swedish officers, who are not particularly enamoured of their work here, will he quite ready to resign provider, that their salaries, &amp;c. are paid. It would therefore seem that it rests with us whether the gendarmerie in Ears is maintained or not; and that if at any moment we decide against them, we have only to remain passive, and the force will melt away for lack of funds to ^ 'l am well aware that the opinion held by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire is that the Swedish officers have shown themselves consistently disinclined to recognise our paramount influence in the southern provinces, and since the war we . have °P enl y abetted the agents of the German Legation m their efforts to injure our interests prestige in every possible way, and that therefore it is our best policy, even at the risk of seeL the whole of the south of Persia fall into a condrtron of anarchy, to bnng about the recall of the Swedish officers, and that to endeavour to maintain them is merely to throw good money after bad. Indeed I have just received a telegram from ^^riiS^SrZTfhr us, as I have said before, will be to retain the Swedes, LtVevents until the end of the war. If, as o°ur recognised the immense harm they have done to Persia and to tp'l succeed m maintaining some degree 1 p roc H v ities, and even against a temporary continuation of t ,, . • fa j s :g e( j b v events the worst supposing that my belief m their change A c ld if bringlnTabout the state of chaos that can happen is that the Germans may prospect of this contingency which must occur if they are withdrawn. As to the , P r “ pe b creatini , a coa litioii which the Germans are apparently endeavouring entertaming great scepticism, against us among the tribes of Pars, I must confess^to entertj ng gre ^ ^ Most Persians and many Em p e h a ' ,s “ d a t P ° J; rehens ions entertained by His Majesty’s mere idea, but m the face of the e _ II , y no y p re p a red to say that consular representatives at Bushire S jraz and Ij made cannot be denied, the thing is impossible.

Their disappeance from Ears necessarily involves recrudescence oi disoider, robbery, and “ rahdari ”* on the main trade routes, and province would rapidly revert to the intolerable condition of anarchy which existed three years ago.

As already stated, I believe that Poussette is generally well disposed and anxious for the sake of his own reputation as well as on general grounds to keep the gendarmerie The question therefore arises what policy do your Excellency and His Majesty s Government, desire to pursue regarding gendarmerie in Ears ? If its continued existence is considered desirable, we should be obliged to supply funds, and might perhaps under take to do so for say, one year, under certain conditions which I would outline somewhat as follows :— 1. Eormal assurances on the part of the commandant of the gendarmerie at Tehran and of the officer commanding at Shiraz that the gendarmerie will observe the strictest neutrality as long as this is the policy of the Persian Government, and that they will take sternest measures to insist on the observance of this policy by Persian officers and men. 2. Withrawal of gendarmerie detachment from Bushire, where their presence is not required, and is only a source of embarrassment and friction. 3. Dismissal of three or four Persian officers known to be chief misckiefmakers in Ears. I further suggest that ,the necessary funds be advanced as a gift, or at any rate as a loan without interest to the Persian Government for this specific purpose, the money to be disbursed by permission of the British Minister from time to time as required on demand of the officer commanding Ears gendarmerie, addressed to the British consul. Total sum to be provided, which would not exceed 50,000L, to be decided in consultation between officer commanding gendarmerie, British consul, and the financial agent in Shiraz.

Herr Wassmuss, who was formerly German Consul ' at Bushire, and has recently been appointed German Consul at Shiraz (where Germany has no commercial interests and lias not hitherto had a consul), was the prime mover in this It is now known that he was at Cairo shortly before the war, and in Constantinople when war broke out.

Section 1, [76446] Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received June 12.) (No. SO.) . Tehran, May 18, 191o. IN my despatch. No. 73 of 5th May I confined myself to the circumstances attending the change of Cabinet, and made no attempt to describe contemporaneous events in the rest of the country. I will now endeavour to do so, but the record will prove to be little more than a report of the continuous German effort displayed in a variety of ways to attack our interests and prestige all over the country, and at all events until Ain-ud-Dowleh had actually formed his Government, an almost complete indifference of the Persian Government to the most flagrant abuses of Persian neutrality. In making this charge against the Persian Government I must not omit to mention that they are almost powerless. Their only real force is the gendarmerie, and, as you are aware, the Swedish officers who command it pay little or no attention to the orders of the Government, and they have often through their anti-Russian sentiments allowed themselves to be drawn by the Germans into action, the significance of which m a country like this they have been quite unable to appreciate. Be this as it may, there is no doubt but that the behaviour of the Swedes has been such as to produce the impression throughout Persia that they and the gendarmerie are thoroughly pro- The German and Austrian Ministers reached the Persian frontier aboiit tbe 18th April • they came with a very large suite, and considering the difficulties ot tien journey, an’inordinate quantity of baggage, among which, as they admitted, were some fifty rifles with ammunition, while later events prove that the common report that t e had a considerable sum in gold has been proved to be true. Major de Maie, who had travelled with them from Constantinople, left them at Bagdad and made arrangements fo r ' Tourney this side of the frontier, provided convoys, &amp;c., for the baggage, and was present at Tverutanshah, and in constant friendly mtercourse wtth the Ge^an consul (unrecognised), while the latter prepared, with the assistance of Dr. /ntgmeyer and Herr Griesinger, the exceptional honours which greeted their Excellencies on ei arrival The “consul” also was busy enlisting men, usually of the lowest type, to foruf a o-uard for the illustrious travellers. Still, with all the attentions spwered on them Prince Reuss and M. Logotheti must have found the pleasure of then |ta&gt; in Kermanshah somewhat marred by the news of Hassan Raouf's incursion at Kasrn-Shinn. The ^nearance of the hero of the “ Hamidieh’s ” cruise during the second Balkan war was decidedly embarrassing, for it was difficult to w ^V^u?s Bagdad nna y - , 11 Kermanshah had been panicstricken, and as you had reached Kerind.

An official reception of Persians occurs only on the arrival of a new Minister, and never on the occasion of a Minister returning from leave, and though the Persian Foreign Office notification was, I believe, due to a blunder, the effect was mischievous. Prince Reuss’s reception was far more numerous 1 ^ attended than that of M. de Etter, and the Persian world drew its own conclusions! Except for this the activities of the German Legation have been carefully concealed. Through the Turkish Embassy great efforts to win over the clergy—more particularly the lower ranks—have been made, and the Democratic party has been ardently courted. Secret recruiting in the name of the Democrats has been carried on at three or four stations, and fantastic theories about the Imperial Bank of Persia intended to discredit its notes, a game in which local bankers great and small have lent a willing hand, have been industriously circulated. A direct attack on the Ministry has been made by a demand of the Turkish Ambassador for the removal of Farman Farma from the Ministry of the Interior on the ground of his anti-Turkish sentiment. In the provinces the German agents have been as busy as ever. When I arrived in Tehran, I learnt that the notorious Wassmuss at Shiraz, was endeavouring to induce the Swedish gendarmerie officers, Major Pravitz and Captains Oertengren and Aangman, to organise an expedition nominally against Kazeroon, but really against the Kalantar of Kumarij, a local chieftain well disposed to us, while a further development of the plan was to organise a coalition of the neighbouring Khans to attack Haidar Khan of Bandarrig, who assisted us in the arrest of Listemann. Mushir-ud-Dowleh’s feeble Government, of course, did nothing but make enquiries, and in the interval before the accession of Ain-ud-Dowleh to office the expedition actually started. His Highness, however, and Farman Farma showed considerable vigour, but the Swedes at Shiraz, as everywhere else, have got so used to acting without consulting the Persian Government—Mustashar-ud-Dowleh had no influence over them whatever—that for a few clays the orders from Tehran were practically disregarded. Eventually, however, the Ministers succeeded in getting their authority respected. Nothing worse than threats reached the Kalantar, and Wassmuss deprived of his escort gave up his excursion into Dashtistan and returned to Shiraz. The situation in Ears has' been very unsatisfactory. Mukhbar-us-bultaneh, the Governor, with his avowed pro-German sympathies, has lent himself unreservedly to Wassmuss’s schemes, so that the latter by a lavish expenditure of money and a still more lavish expenditure in Iving reports of disaster to us and our Allies, has had little difficulty in creating a strong current of public opinion against us, and has been more particularly successful in gaining over the noisy and mischievous self-seekers who call themselves the Democratic party. To induce any Government in the circumstances prevailing at Tehran, to arrest Wassmuss would have been impossible, and my efforts have, therefore, been directed towards obtaining the lecall of the Governor-General. Ain-ud-Dowleh has promised me that this shall be done, and agreed to my informing Major O’Connor of this promise, and of a fuithei undertaking that Kawem-ul-Mulk will be selected to act as temporary Governor pending the appointment of a successor—probablv the Zill-us-Sultan—to Mukh bar-us-Sultaneh. . Poussette of the Svyedish gendarmerie is on his way to replace Major Pravitz, whose Germanophil sentiments made his retention at Shiraz most undesirable, and it is to be hoped that he will be able to restrain the indiscretions of Captains Aangman and Oertengren. . . Is P al »“ a month ago was scarcely better than Fars. The notorious Pugin was jome( atei y uigmeyer and Griesinger, and they carried out the usual programme of recruiting volunteers, &amp;c., and with the assistance of Agha Nourulla, Mujtahid, who is a_ brother of the late Agha Nejefi, and has recently become an Ottoman subject, oo aim &lt; m suppoit of the local mullahs, and by pretending svmpathy with the e 7J ocr T ats wa? j t0 co iin f on the support of that noisy party/ As usual also a run on ye mpena Bank of Persia was started, but lasted only three days. The Governor, wro ike everyone eise, felt that he could not count on the gendarmerie in any action rat lie might take ho put a stop to Turco-German agitation, was almost powerless, the more so as ns cousin Zargham-us-Sultaneh, a rather weak-minded but not entirely unimportant Bakhtian Khan, had come under Pugin’s blandishments. Mr. Grahames most recent telegrams show the situation to have somewhat improved, and there are signs that the mullahs and the public generally are coming to then senses. fins again is due to the feeling that the reins of power at Tehran have oeen grasped by stronger hands, and the Governor now professes to be able to deal im v with the situation, though he has not been able so far to remove the wireless i V( of Pi Si G Pi to Sll to of ai ! ai ac G to I C( p tl 01 0!bill's (| Si tbee fitt l;; healr- iigtoiii' i ittaciliij Mid-We tie kfe stotei : gthete JHki: ilk, k«F: ,s to i? ro- ic paro ■ sst fe is temp' IS-blP telcgraphie installation which the Germans have erected two miles outside the town. , 1 / St me Q T a '? e n' th( i t ^ iati was by the apparatus was to the effect that the ex-Shah has left Odessa for Baku. Ai Bushire, an incident in wdiich the Governor appealed to Major Trevor to lend ^ slim the assistance of our detachment there, after the gendarmerie had failed him, has been represented as an attempt on our part to overawe the gendarmerie, and I regret to say that b arman Farma does not appear to have acted very prudently in the matter, being disposed apparently to accept the Persian gendarmerie officer’s totally inaccurate account of the incident. But I have no doubt whatever of getting the matter put right. Ah Sultanabad and Hamadan the Furco-German propaganda has been earned on in much the same way and by the same means, and it is reported that steps are being taken to open the campaign also at Ivoom, Kashan, Kirin an, and elsewhere. An application for the recognition of Zugmeyer as German consul at Kirman has been refused by the Persian Government, but as an exequatur has been granted for a Swiss named Weber at Hamadan, in spite of the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ assurances to me that none would be given, I am not confident that it will not eventuallv be issued. There is no disguising the fact that the Turco-German campaign has achieved a very considerable measure of success. It is built up almost entirely on the foundation of Persian hatred for Russia, and is no proof of any affection for Germany. The average Persian would like to see Russia defeated in this war, and the attitude shown by the Swedes who cannot have failed to expatiate to their Persian friends on the greatness of German military power, has persuaded the Persians that their wish may be fulfilled. Possibly they do not believe all the German accounts of glorious victories, but they like to read of them, while the more veracious accounts which we publish of our own successes are neglected because they are unpleasant. But no thinking Persian wants to go to war with Russia and England ; the consequences,’ immediate by the stoppage of trade which would deprive Persia in a few weeks of many of the necessaries of life, and ultimately, when at the end of the war we have our hands free to deal with Persia, are too well recognised ; but there is an acute satisfaction at seeing Russia flouted by the Germans, and public opinion, such as it is, dislikes and opposes any action of the Government, either in the capital or the provinces, which interferes with German activity. The Persians hope for nothing by our defeat in the war. They think that Germany is too far off, and they believe that Turkey would be encouraged by Germany to recoup herself in Asia for the expenses of the war. They do not understand the danger of being hustled into the war by the Germans, as were the Turks, and so continue to play with fire, by hampering the Ministers in their endeavours to maintain Persian neutrality. If the Cabinet was strong it would not matter, but it is not, and therefore, as I have endeavoured to explain in various telegrams, we are obliged to rely on our strength. In addition to the wireless installation set up at Ispahan, the German Legation has established a station here, and messages are already being exchanged. I have, &amp;c. C. M.

Information received from Kazerun last night that Captain Oertengren has sent orders to Kalantar of Kamarij giving him 14 hours to evacuate Kamarij. Fighting is said to have begun between gendarmes and Kalantar’s men. Doctor Cara and four ladies of C. M. S., en route for Ispahan from Bushire, arrived at Kamarij yesterday. I made urgent representations last night to Governor-General and Pravitz regarding situation. Ends. Second begins. During the last few days Wassmuss and Governor of Kazerun, who was lately a gendarmerie officer and Persian gendarmerie officer at Kazerun have been guests of Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli. They are undoubtedly carrying on intrigues with latter, object of which is not fully apparent, as Captain Oertengren himself at Kazerun. Proceedings of his Persian officer must be within his knowledge and approval. I again venture to invite Your Excellency’s attention to open support afforded to Wassmuss’s intrigues by both Swedish and Persian gendarmerie officers. Ends.46 Third heqins. Latest news from Kazerun is that Wassrmi«s accom- nanied by Persian gendarmerie officer returned to Kazerun last night and leit for Shiraz at midnight. No fighting has taken place at Kamari], but gendar- merie threaten Kalantar who, however, has refused to quit He is prepared to resist any attempt to turn him out by force Ah Kuli Khan has armed at Kazerun from Borasjun and is inciting ISur Muhammad Khan of Dahki to inarch on Kamarij with tufangchis. Missionary party is safe. It seems that Swedish officers and Governor-General have entirely disregarded orders of Persian Government regarding Kamarip 1 venture to suggest that orders should be repeated and gendarmerie expedition recalled immediately.

Urgent. Please refer to my telegram, No. 169. There is no improvement in the situation here. The Mejlis which in order to escape from Saad-ed-Howleh accepted Ain-ed-Dowleh joytuliy is acting iu a hostile manner. The masses of the people are discontented and angry with the Cabinet—their hatred for the Russians is being actively worked up by German (Agents ?). They are being taught that Russia and England have forced the Cabinet on them. German Minister has introduced a considerable quantity of arms and is trying to enlist men by bribery. Legislation passed to relieve Imperial Bank of Persia has had little effect to reassure public and its notes are now thoroughly discredited and only accepted at considerable discount by speculators. Runs have been started (on) the (head office ?) of the Bank and its Provincial branches. In order to put a stop on the German intrigues we are urging the Persian Government to take active measures. Unless the Government can count upon material support, it is pretty evident (that) it will not be able to deal with the situation and I am glad to learn from the Russian Minister that orders have been sent to Tiflis to send two brigades to Enzeli. French Minister and I agree that the troops are urgently needed and the Russian Minister is telegraphing to his Government to hasten their despatch.

The Governor having received reliable report that a certain Haji Ali of Tangak. a village on the isthmus to the main land, was quietly collecting Tangistani ritiemen with a view to attack at Hesideney or making other disturbances, determined to apprehend him and seat out riflemen and gendarmerie to surprise him last night. His Excellency did not mention it to me; first intimation being a brisk fusilade behind the Residency early morning 6th May. Surprise failed owing to gendarmerie deserting. This morning Governor applied urgently to me for assistance of about 50 men. It was unsatisfactory only receiving information and requests for assist ance when the affair had been mismanaged, but as it seemed highly inadvis able for the Governor’s men to be worsted by recalcitrant headman I asked Officer Commanding Troops kindly to give assistance and he agreed. Haji Ali was found in a strong position defying the Governor’s men and indeed position seemed too strong for 50 men to take so reinforcements were asked for. As these approached, Haji Ali and his men kept up a heavy fire on them, but when they got near, he and his brother with some followers attempted to break out but both were hit and wounded severely. Former was removed by his followers to Imamzada shrine. Meanwhile village was rushed by original party. Our casualties were killed one sepoy, two wounded. Enemy casualties were killed five or six and several wounded, besides two abovementioned. Party of 50 men has been left in occupation of village for the present and post established isthmus. Piquet line on the. isthmus will probably be necessary for sometime to prevent surprises by hostile tribesmen from the mainland and to guard against their surreptitious entry to island.

The Governor-General of Shiraz the principal focus of intrigues and agitation against H J y ieJU h ?48 Government in the south of Persia; hostile Khan Dashti looks to the Governor- General for both support and encouragement, while Governor and those friendly to us here do not get any. Matters will not improve, in my opinion, unless and until such time as Governor-General has been recalled, and as situation is showing signs of rapidly developing, I respectfully beg to support the proposal of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, in which he urges that Persian Government may be pressed to fulfil their promise (s) made to us—vide British Minister, Tehran’s telegram No. 12o—and recall him at once. 9 Telegram P., No. 48, dated (and received) the 8th May 1915.

I am informed by my Kussian Colleague that despatch of Bussian troops is a very doubtful matter, as Viceroy of Caucasus says that he is unable to spare any troops. The position here is always a precarious one though it is not at once critical. German agents in Persia, by means of further expenditure, by playing on Persian prejudices, viz^j hatred of itussia, mistrust of ourselves, and Isfam sentiments, &amp;e., by circulation of lying reports of Turkish and German victories, and by exploiting difficulties of Imperial Bank of Persia, have ensnared public opinion entirely in the capital. In fact they have on their side the Persian Press and Parliament. They are in possession of arms and are enlisting recruits. Same conditions prevail but in different degrees in the towns of Shiraz, Ispahan, Ramadan, Suitanabad and Kermanshah. It is evident from all their preparations that there is on hand a concerted plan to attack us and it is my opinion that attempt will not be long deferred. Cabinet, though we have impressed on them what the result for Persia will eventually be, are themselves in a measure impressed by action of Germans in Persia and they are (two groups undecipherable) afraid to act against very powerful sentiments of pro-German Party in Tehran. Moreover, except for police they have no force to rely on and are practically powerless to do any thing. My Russian, Prench and Belgian Colleagues are of the same opinion as myself that only chance (of) saving the situation is by the immediate despatch of troops to Rnzeli and even this step may at the present time be too late as Germans, now that they are aware that their cause is lost in Europe, w T iil stop at nothing. What tue nature of the attack will be I am not able to say. Germans have so completely mastered the situation here that violent measures are unnecessary, but in provinces the situation may be different.

Urgent. Reference correspondence ending with Bushire telegram, 163 0., 7 th May. The favourable or unfavourable trend of the situation in hinterland and success or failure of the schemes of Wassmuss and Governor-General seemlikely to depend more on local developments and action than on pious utterance or orders emanating from Central Government. It is possible that recent fracas may he used as a pretext for fresh demonstrations of hostility. In any case we need to be sure that our position on Bushire Island is sufficiently secure against all likely contingencies and to this end I recommend location at Bushire of four mountain guns and presence of His Majesty’s ship. The mere knowledge that we possessed guns and could control approaches from mainland would in itself he effective deterrent against attack.

Begins. My telegram, 63-420. Gendarmerie party of one Persian officer and about 25 men here is thorn in flesh of Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports. In order to test them he sent them with his men on night 5th-(kh May to apprehend Haji Ali, hut on arrival at scene of action they cleared off and left Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports’ men in lurch. Again yesterday they withdrew from firing line of Governor of the Peraian Gu Poi s men. In fact they showed very clearly they were on side of Tangistanis._ Further, the officer who is a conceited sprig of Kajar nobility on two occasions wished to open fire on parties of the Indian Regiment when marching out for exercise. On second occasion he was with difficulty dissuaded by one of Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports’ men. If they had opened fire, no doubt he and his party would have been quickly disposed of, but in order to prevent chance of any thing of sort and as Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports and I are convinced that these gendarmes are on side of the hostile Khans if not their active Agents- I venture to hope that Your Excellency wifi think fit to effect their immediate recall. Gendarmes have never been desirable on this end of Shiraz road, but now when their officer’s plot with Khans as at Kazerun a nd Borasiun and their men desert at critical moments their presence is a positive danger. Just now gendarmerie here is occupying a tower on isthmus which belon-s to the Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports and Officer Commanding told Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports to-day that they refused to leave unless turned out by force. As we have been obliged to put posts across isthmus, it is possible that the party will come into conflict with our men shortly. It is advisable that tower should be occupied either by Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports’ men or ours. It is objectionable having untrustworthy people in the line of posts and these make another reason for their recall. Addressed Tehran; repeated Basrah and Shiraz.

In view of telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, No. 161, to Foreign Office, I suggest for consideration that we should warn Souletand Kawatn at once that reports received from His Majesty’s Minister show that it appears certain that Germany will be successful in drawing Persia into war; that there can only be one result and that all their interests lie in avoid ing rupture with power that controls the Persian Gulf, and that the following inducements are offered them. In the event of our coming out victorious as we have complete confidence that we must do, our policy will be to preserve the Chiefships of Kashkai and Khamseh tribes in their person and in their own families, and to keep them in full enjoyment of properties which they now own, and to leave them to manage their tribal affairs under our aegis. That what we desire of them at the present moment is the expulsion from Pars of the intriguer Mukhbir-es'Sultaneh and his German adherents; to control the petty Khans and gendarmerie; to protect telegraph employes and British subjects in Pars; to keep telegraph lines and road between Shiraz and Bushire open and secure; to put a stop to fanaticism and lawlessness and generally to keep order on our behalf in Pars until the conclusion of hostilities. That in consideration of undertaking to do this, we wall permit them to collect normal revenue and give them at once five thousand pounds for expenses and if required assistance with arms and ammunition and that in the event of their successfully carrying on to end of war in addition to above assurances we will give them ten thousand pounds each and absolve them from payment of any arrears on account of revenue of past year which may be due to the Govern ment of Persia. We might also undertake that Governorship of Luristan should be vested in K(hamseh) family. At the same time we should permit the Shaikh of Mohammerah to wire to Soulet reminding him of the formation of confederation and calling on him now to make pact with the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh and himself. 17 Telegram V., No. 1082 B., dated the ]0th (received 11th) May 1915.

Please see telegram from Minister at Tehran to Poreign Office, No. 161. As regards Bakhtiaris the following is outlook. Bahadur and Sirdar Jang are at Dieful. With regard to murder of Dyer and affairs in Arabistan, I have exchanged friendly letters with them, but the representative they sent to interview me was not plenipotentiary and neither the Sheikh of Mohammerah nor I felt able to discuss with him any important or secret matters. I am waiting for an opportunity of meeting them very soon at Bamuz. IPith regard to fanatical rising in Shuster, rising in Arabistan, safe conduct of Wassmuss and incursion of Turkish troops, the attitude of Sirdar Jang, however, has been nost equivocal and even Doctor Young, bis staunch adherent, telegraphed on 27th April that the present attitude of Sirdar excited his grave suspicion. I was reminded by the Sheikh of Mohammerah that the Bakhtiaris are not a one corporate body but a monster with many beads, that now their interests are not limited to Bakhtiari country any longer but that they have extended their tentacles all over Persia and although he thinks that they will not enter into war seriously from self interest, he is not confident of their being prepared to enter into any compact with him and us. As stated before, he is, however, prepared to enter in our joint interests into matrimonial project should it prove likely to promote a satisfactory agreement. It is possible that Sirdar Jang may seek to avoid open meeting with my representative or me in view of iiis recent attitude in which case I would propose to send Haji Bais as my representative also as that of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Por the object in view we could hardly have a better emissary.i * 52 We should state the following requirements after pointing out what the ■Rnhhtiaris may -ain by peaceful co-operation with Sheikh and us and what S stand to loTe by joining in hostilities against us. They must dec me to rise a-ainst ns and must do all in their power to discourage generally and must vigorously suppress it within their tribal territory. They must secure Tn escort at Ispahan itself where their representative must protect all subject of Great Britain and her allies on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road and m sphere of Oil Company and maintain order internally and must maintain up to Bars boundary security of telegraph line (s) and road. ^ They must arrive at a permanent friendly understanding with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and give him all the co-operation m Arabistan that is neces sary by maintaining peace on border and by refusing to harbour refugees from his territory At Behbehan their representative must maintain order there and in the same manner suppress fanaticism and refrain from interfering at all with the Sheikh of Mobammerah’s tribes m that neighbourhood or with Lirawi. Any Bakhtiari being a provincial Governor in Southern Persia on^the outbreak of hostilities must do his utmost to suppress fanaticism and keep Bakhtiari quiet and neutral and to protect British intersts and subjects. We should m return for this, undertake to preserve at the conclusion of the war Bakhtiari country with its present limits for tribe and give Khans local autonomy to deal in their own way under our aigis with their own tribesmen. We should agree to keen under our guidance Bakhtiari Governorship at Ispahan and be prepared to consider among others Bakhtiari candidates for other Governors m sphere under our control. Later on we should be prepared to consider sympathetically any workable proposal that they may put forward for obtaining access to Persian Gulf P^rts. We would pay each branch £5,000 now and at conclusion of hostilities £10,000 each, provided they fulfil effectively their part of the bargain on receiving undertaking to the effect required from recognised representatives of two families. ) 18 Telegram P., No. 1083 B , dated (and received) the 11th May 1915.

Please refer to the telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister to the Poreign Office, London, dated 8th instant, No. 161. Por the Bushire hinterland I would make the following suggestions:— Wb have in our favour Khans of Budhilleh, Lirawi, Hayat, Baud and probably Shabancara, while Borasjun, Ahmedi and Tangistan and probably Haliki are hostile. Borasjun is likely to succeed in getting Daliki to join him though the Agent of Nizam-us-Sultaneh at Mohammerah has been doing his best to persuade Daliki to stand out. If Soulet and Kawam stand in with us, the Khans in (outlying) country will, more or less, be cut off from telegraph (communication) from Tehran. In this way effective combination for attack on Bushire will be difficult, but they may be expected to divert their attention to Haidar Khan, our friend, who helped us in arresting Germans. In order to secure the active co-operation of members of friendly elements in suppressing any fanatical movement and in opposing hostile confederation if rising takes shape and in order to keep them together, the following inducements should be offered in anticipation (of) successful issue to war. We should undertake to detach Lirawi from Behbehan and associate it with Hayat Baud under Bushire. We should also assist Khans to buy out Saiyid- us-Sultaneh’s interest in district.

Urgent. Please see telegram of the 8th instant, No. 161, from Tehran. I submit that on the outbreak of war action to be taken in Persian ports requires immediate consideration and decision. Urgent desideratum is first and foremost that as many of His Majesty’s ships as can be spared should be made available from East Inaies Squadron. Ail we have to do at Mohammerah is to make prize of “ Persopolis” and take over customs at Mohammerah and Ahwaz. I think that it would be politic and have an excellent effect if we allow Sheikh of Mohammerah to put in guards and allow Belgians to carry on as usual. This (only means?) keeping account of receipts and allowing them to be taken, for the present, by the Sheikh of Mohammerah. As in 1909, we should immediately land a naval brigade at Bushire to seize and occupy custom-house, and place cordon round town in concert with military, the same as was done in the year 1909 In due coarse the duties can be handed over to the military, hut the occupation of the town and custom-house can be carried out most effectively by landing parties from ships in harbour preceded by armed boats. That the number of troops available will depend on conditions prevailing in India, I am aware, but, in the event of war, I do not think that the situation at Bush re would be satisfactory with less than four guns, two battalions and the presence of a cruiser such as H. M. S. “ Eox,” with large white crew. We should control postal and telegraph communication with Bunder 4.bbas and Liugah immediately on the outbreak ot hostilities and I am of opinion that these ports would give little trouble when they knew that Bushire ■Jas occupied. At Lingah there is a young German remaining, but he is not important^enough to make it worth wlnle causing a disturbance in order to capture him.

Please refer to Sir Cox’s telegrams, Nos. 1081 B. to 1083 B., inclusive, of 10th instant. Our policy should, until a rupture actually occurs, be to endeavour to induce the Khans by friendly representation to prevent isolated attacks on our Consulates and officers and to protect our interests generally. Bv disburse ments of secret service money which we have already authoiised this attitude can be encouraged. My view is that, if unfortunately war with Persia should breakout, we should leave Bushire hinterland and Ears severely alone, and merelv hold the Bushire peninsula itself if we have the troops available. To commit ourselves etther to Soulet or Ka warn in Ears, or to entangle ourselves in a mesh of inter tribal intrigue in the Bushire hinterland, seems to me to be useless. Should occasion arise and in the event of their extricating our Consul and his staff from Shiraz, Kawam and Soulet might be given a liberal sum for service rendered and be promised generally, in proportion to their services hereafter, rewards and recognition. But only in the event of the outbreak of war should such promises be given.

I venture very respectfully to express fullest agreement with general principle (of) proposals put forward by Cox. As Your Excellency is aware I have long been urging some definite line of policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government towards Ilkhani’s two great tribal groups in Pars. Neither I believe have any desire to see Southern Persia involved in disastrous war, and I believe if I were now authorised to make to them certain proposals on lines of those advocated by Cox it might be possible with their help to keep peace in Southern Persia even in event of other parts of the country being forced into hostilities by German intrigues. If His Majesty’s Government agree that attempt should be made to do so I would request permission to enter immediately into negotiations with Kawam and Soulet on lines proposed by Cox and I venture to submit follow ing further suggestions :— Firstly, that Your Excellency should endeavour to obtain Shah’s telegrams to Kawam and Soulet informing them that it is his special desire that country should remain neutral and [come into forcing ( Padjuring)] them to use every effort to observe his wishes in this respect and to maintain peace and order in Southern Persia. Secondly, immediate nomination of Zil-es-Sultan or other royal Prince as Governor-General, Ears, who should issue similar instructions and should nominate Kawam to officiate for him until his arrival. Both Kawam and Soulet would attach importance to such authority and would, I think, hesitate to adopt our proposals without it. I venture to urge if any such policy is to be adopted necessary instruc tions should be issued with least possible delay. Meanwhile adoption of suggestion submitted in my telegram No. 137 would enable Kawam to begin at once to collect force for protecting town.

Since the affair which took place last Thursday our troops are holding (possibly ?) posts, as in Colonel Smith’s defence scheme on Mashila and south of Sabzabad, and are in good position to prevent any attack by tribesmen unless in (considerable ?) numbers. “ In the event of war breaking out, the Officer Commanding the troops is of opinion that he would, with only one battalion at his disposal, be obliged to withdraw all his posts and occupy Malik’s house. This would, to my mind, be great mistake as it would leave greater part of island free to be overrun by tribesmen and mean loss of prestige and would absolutely invite attack; besides eventually we would have to retake these posts.59 ^rescli wi| ^ lc y is ^ disa% ^iafro^ 'ssaij i .6 Mm 1915.

Major Pravitz before his departure purchased one thousand English sovereigns from Wassmuss and was very indignant with bank manager because latter refused to buy them from him. Pravitz wrote me extraordinary letter on the subject, of which I am sending you copy. W’assmuss is living in garden adjoining Swedes and is in constant com munication with them.

Since yesterday the situation over here has developed very rapidly, and Persian Cabinet has submitted its resignation to His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Moreover our position has been affected most gravely by a run on Imperial Bank of Persia, which has been organised by German Legation ; this Legation has itself withdrawn in bullion over sixty thousand tomans; only this morning I was informed by Manager of Bank that he will not be able to meet more than 80^ of bis notes of issue. Bank’s present plight has been brought about by its inability to transfer cash from provinces, as a result of insecurity of roads and failure on the part of Persian Government to repay large advance made. If Bank suspends payment, this is certain to result in serious disturbances at Tehran and as disturbances are being fomented by | India, Foreign Secretary's I No 20 datec * 20 aiAYi915—T—&lt; •• gM- ■' 1 ■ — 34 \ European agitators, they threaten to become of suoh a character that only a very strong Government, with the support of British and Russian Legations, can hope to cope with it. Mv French and Russian colleagues and I have agreed to bring about form- nfinn of a stron^ Persian Cabinet Council and Saad-ed-Dowleh, Ain-ed- Dowleh and Parraan Parma have signified their willingness to take office. My Russian colleague and I are to see His Imperial Majesty the Shah to-morrow and urge on His Majesty the acceptance of such a Cabinet. In case situation nrmears likely to get beyond our control, we also consider that Russian troops which are stationed at Kasvin should he brought to Tehran and reinforcements held in readiness to proceed in reserve. My Russian colleague is sending a telegram to his Government in this sense, and I trust that requisite authority mnv ho received from Petrograd at once. Dismissal of Swedish gendarmerie officers will probably be necessary, but we are of opinion that we can then rely on gendarmes and on police if they are paid. Loyalty of Persian Cossack brigade is doubtful, unless they are support ed by Russian troops. As regards Bank’s plight, Government is to issue a proclamation in which it will be declared that Bank notes are legal tender^ at Bank, but Bank will have to advance some funds to Government which is practically in a penniless condition. Russian Bank is not in a position to assist the Imperial Bank of Persia. Arrival in a day or two of German and Austrian Ministers which is timed no doubt to coincide with run on Bank, makes next few days ciitical, and pos sibility of our being able to hold up situation depends, in my opinion, on our being able to rely on material support which can be afforded by Russian troops.

It is disunited and deplorably weak and its only merit is its readiness to resign. “We ought, I think, to work for the formation, under Ain-ed-Dowleh, of a stronger Cabinet, if possible. Ain-ed-Dowleh is perhaps the only and the best man in Persia who is capable of dealing with the agitations of the Germans whose activities are on the increase. He w T ill be accepted by the RussianLf^ation and I hope that the appointment of Saad-ed-Dowleh will not be insisted on by the .Russian Government, for though he is a resolute and capable person he has no following or prestige in the country (like that ?) possessed by Ain-ed-Dowleh. “ Confidential.

Eollowing from Shiraz, April 23rd, No. 98:— Begins. During last few days, Wassmuss and his friends have been inundating town with virulent and incentive anti-English pamphlets contain ing exhortations to revenge and jehad. All my advisers including Kawam regard situation as very critical and consider popular outbreak as certainty in near future unless Persian Government take really energetic and effective steps to cope with evil. In spite of constant remonstrances, Governor-General does nothing, and is known, on the contrary, to sympathise (with; and to be supporting pro- German campaign. Matters have reached stage, when minor measures, such as transfer of Persian gendarmerie officer from one post to another, can exercise no real effect on general situation. I have no means of combating German intrigues except by representations to local authorities and by advice to few Persian friends who still remain loyal to us. It is my duty, therefore, to inform Your Excellency that I regard situation in Ears as extremely critical. I still think that, if Persian Government really desire to maintain their neutrality, they can do so by energetic action of the nature outlined in Cox’s telegram No. 893 B. First and most essential step is removal from Hamadan (?) of Governor- General and bis replacement temporarily by Kawam. Latter would be prepared to do all that lies in his power to maintain order and neutrality^ if appointed to act as Governor-General. Both he and Soulet should receive instructions from Persian Government to act accordingly. Other desirable measures are withdrawal of Swedes and deportation of It Wassmuss and other German emissaries. If, however, Persian Government fail to agree to any of suggested measures, or to take any other steps of effective nature to suppress agitation, I venture again to express opinion that situation will unquestionably go from bad to worse.

Saad-ed-Dowleh has been vmable, even with energetic support of two Legations, to form Cabinet, as influential men so necessary to deal with situation, who bad given us assurances of their co-operation with him, have feared to face universal detestation in which he is held. Difficulties were put in his way even by Ain-ed-Dowleh and Shah. Russian Charge d’Affaires and I decided that in these circumstances and in view of urgent necessity for introducing a measure to stop run on Imperial Bank of Persia and impending arrival German Minister with large following of agitators, a strong Cabinet must be formed immediately and we agreed to drop Saad-ed-Dowleh in favour of Ain-ed-Dovvleh who enjoys confidence of JVlejlis for the moment. I was received by Shah yesterday morning and informed His Majesty that we should do so in deference to his wishes and a couple of days later Ain-ed- Dowleh received his firman of appointment. Steps have been taken by him to pass a law suspending payment in cash by Bank and he is supported loyally by the Mejlis. To-morrow the proclamation should appear. In spite of German efforts to take advantage of the excitement likely to ensue from financial crisis, Ain-ed-Dowleh is confident that he can maintain order. But during the last few days Tehran has been much inclined to panic and members of Turkish Embassy have been to United States Legation for safety and town believes that on April 24th German Charge d’Affaires slept there. An excellent effect has been produced owing to vigorous united action of two Legations, and I think that we shall have as strong a Government as Persia can produce while even Mejlis seems to comprehend necessity for enforcement of Persian neutrality. Confidential. That the accession of Ain-ed-Dowleh to power instead of Saad-ed-Dowleh is already looked on f ere as a triumph for British as against Russian influence is on the other hand unfortunate and I fear that a similar view will be taken at Petrograd. But I am positive that Saad-ed-Dowleh’s appointment could not have been brought about without Russian troops from Kasvin and moreover ( ? ) was wanting. Indeed we were overloaded with personal unpopularity of Saad-ed-Dowleh and additional weight of Persian hatred of Russia. Earman Parma has been induced by us to join Cabinet and by forcing any particular Minister on him, though, I think, it wiser not to embarrass (Ain-ed- Dowleh). I have let him know (that) inclusion of Yossughed Dowleh might be politic. Inclusion of these two would give Russia complexion (?) to Cabinet.

All these are most objectionable from our point of view. In the case of (5), I presume His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate his presence here, and perhaps the Persian Government rmght be moved to telegraph urgent orders to Governor-General here, to send out and “form him that Persian Government cannot agree to hrs commg to Bushire or remaining in Dashtistan. In the event of his coming on, should I arrange with Officer Commanding the troops to send a party to try and intercept him ? If he brings many gendarmes, this might result in a disturbance.

In any case he will cause a lot of excitement here and disturbances. Trust you will be able to get Persian Government to telegraph im mediately to the Governor in sense indicated in my telegram No. This morning His Excellency mentioned to Residency Dragoman that he had heard Wassmuss had left Shiraz and that if latter came here it would be the cause of great disturbances. But Governor is unlikely to take any steps toprevent Wassmuss’s coming without orders from Tehran. If Persian Govern ment do not issue instructions to Governor, perhaps it would be advisable to inform them that, as Wassmuss is advisedly a firebrand stirring up tribes to jehad, his presence at Borasjun is a menace to our interests at Bushire and he should be called back and not allowed to proceed to Bushire; and that if he enters Bushire we shall be compelled in our own interests and to preserve order to take all possible steps to remove him.

Poliowing from Shiraz, No. 108 :— Begins. Major Pravitz informed me some days (?go) that he has applied j for leave and will start shortly for Sweden. This will leave two junior Swedes who are not regular officers with Pars gendarmerie. As already reported gendarmerie finances are desperate. Men have not been paid for months and there are heavy arrears. There have been many symptoms of disaffection lately and other abuses which must arise when men are not paid. Present gendarmerie organisation in fact is fast breaking down and cannot last much longer. Pars gendarmerie cannot safely be entrusted to two young i inexperienced Swedes and it cannot exist without money. I am firm believer in principle of gendarmerie, which even under Swedes has more than justified itself by results. I venture to urge, therefore, that we should now undertake to provide funds for its continuance but on condition that foreign officers shall be changed. I have already submitted suggestions regarding their replacement. Addressed Tehran; repeated Basrah, Bushire. Telegram, No. 1007 B., dated (an^^received) the 30th April 1915.

I gather, however, from various sources that it is intended to remove Kalantar, and, if he resists, there will be fighting and such may spread. Whole affair is intrigue as arranged by Governor-General and his clique supported by gendar merie. What is required is immediate recall of gendarmerie expedition and urgent order to Governor-General and Pravitz that present Kalantur is not to be°interfered with.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, ip 0 The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please see Government of India telegram, No. 429 S. and my telegram No. 170. By the substitution of Ain-ed-Dowleh for Mushir-ed-Dowleh in the Persian Cabinet situation here has been very materially altered. X think present Government now realises that whatever value Persian neutrality may have for IXis Majesty’s Government, it is of vital importance so far as she is concerned, and I am of opinion that present Government will prove to be both willing and able to defend it without making demands of an impossible nature which their predecessors indulged in. Por example, though as a matter of form present Cabinet might demand recall from Kasvin of Russian troops, I believe, that in their hearts, they would be sorry if they succeeded in this. I am entirely satisfied, up to the present, with action taken by them in reply to representations submitted by me, and 1 believe that it is their sincere desire to work with us. At all events they have acted energetically in matter regarding Imperial Bank of Persia and Cabinet is therefore regarded as committed to us. It is also apparent that Persian Government is doing its utmost to meet wishes of Russian Legation. In the eyes of Persia we have (been ?) the means of bringing Ain-ed-Dowleh into Office, and he will not be able to resist Tureo-German pressure if we do not support him; in which dase Persian questions will again be allowed to drift, as was the case under Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s regime. The support that will be required by Ain-ed-Dowleh is, of course, of a financial kind, but I have not held out any hopes of his receiving such support from us unless and until it is shown to our satisfaction that administration of Cabinet deserves it. It is, of course, a question for decision of His Majesty’s Goveriiment as to value which the neutrality of Persia has for us, but it strikes me that strong position which has been achieved by my Russian colleague and myself here within the last few days should, provided our respective Governments are prepared to afford a reasonable amount of financial support to Persia, enable us to maintain that neutrality, while, if such support is refused, position now secured would be worse than thrown away. Ain-ed-Dowleh has been informed by me that any support, which we may decide to give, will only be for immediate needs of Persian Cabinet, as hands of His Majesty’s Government are too full with other matters to discuss any large scheme, and funds can, of course, he doled out to him and stopped in the event of Cabinet failing to satisfy our requirements. Please let me know if I may continue my conversations with Ain-ed- Dowleh on the above lines and ascertain from Cabinet what are their urgent needs. Russian Minister will arrive to-morrow.

(Repeated to Tehran and Sir T. Cox.) \t [ ^°P osals to P ( - ry ‘ a - Heference to ('ox’s tele^i-am No. oJ4 B, of J Jtli April. From recent correspondence, especially Persian Governments telegram of 18 th April to Persian Consuls Jeneral' in I ndia mde my telegram of 22nd April, present Persian Government appears (1) To nave conceived exaggerated idea ol importance of their neutrality to British Government; (2) To be genuinely embarrassed by vlrnlent anti-Pnssian and m consequence, anti-British feeling of populace; (3) To be inclined under 1 urko-German pressure to make impossible demands upon us. In these circumstances I consider oiler of any further inducements to 1 ersian Government to maintain their neutrality would merely be construed as sign of weakness and be ineffective. Most that I would recommend is moratorium in regard to payment of interest on loans on condition of their mere friendly behaviour. At the same time 1 think we should be wise to relax our pressure on Persian Government in connection witli Pars. Demand ifbr withdrawal of Governor-General and Swedes does not appear likely to succeed and only tends to force Persian Government under German advice, jinto making impossible counter demands. So long as I hi shire itself is safe our interests in Pars and South Persia generally are not for the present ol paramount importance, for tin 1 time being, therefore, I recommend, so lar as possible, a silence. This will alleviate friction which threatens to’become acute in regard to fars situation, will tend to disconcert Persian Govern ment, and will give our success at Shaiba and Zobeir time to have maximum effect. Indeed, we must depend rather on practical proof of our strength than on diplomatic pressure, in dealing with Persian Government. As regards Plenms of Nejel and Kerbela, I have arranged for editor of “llabl- ul-Matin,” who has become friendly and enjoys considerable influence, to address letters to them. Beyond this I do not think further action is at present desirable. We should wait to ascertain definite wishes of Ulemas themselves before committing ourselves to any promise in regard to future of shrines.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 5 * Ip SO /I 9 I 5 and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

A copy of a letter from; Major Fdwall, Chief Instructor of the Gendanrerie, to the Persian Minister of the Interior is also enclosed herewith. This letter which was communicated to re by the Foreign Office in a remo- randur of which translation is enclosed, informs of the dis position of the arms and err unit ion in question and formed the substance of ry abovarentioned telegram. Copy of ry reply to the aboverentioxied memorandum from the Foreign Minister is also enclosed. Were it not for the excha -ge of telegrams between the German Charge &amp;*Affaires and tne German Consul at Bushire, there would not appear any sound reason to doubt that these arms ■end exrunition are intended lor the legitimate use of the Gendarmerie. lis Majesty's Consul General at Isfahan, to which town tne whole consign.ont nas been forwarded, reports that a considerable portion t ; thereof has been sent on for the use of the Gendarmerie &amp; Guru jird. I have the honour to be with the highest respect.Meiroraaduir conrunicatod to tii© Minister tor Foregn AfTairs on March 17 1915. In January last a consigmrent of 1400 cases of anrs and anriunition and boxrbs which had been landed at Bushiro for the GendanreriQ were taken delivery of by Captains Poussette and Lundbor^ who had been specially sent for the purpose to Shiraz, and conveyed to tne latter place. Although there was no reason to suppose at that iroirent that the arcs and amrunition were not * destined for the legitimate uses of tne Gendarmerie, the consignment was handled in such a peculiar and secretive manner that some suspicion as to their real destination was expressed at the time. Almost simultaneously h00,000 rounds of ammunition mien nad been previously deposited i at hohaxnrnorah were despatched to Anwaz, uaddr orders to be forwarddd from- thence to Isfahan. This ammunition was however detained at Ahwaz and had been returned to Moham- merah after the arrival of British troops at Ahwaz. There was so much mystery attaching to the r transportation of both these consignments of arms that much suspicion was aroused, although at the time the good faith of the Swedish officers and indirectly of their employ er, the Persian Government, was not in question. From information that has since come into the possession of the British authorities in tne Persian. Gulf it would appear evident that tno despatch ox this wor material was connected with a German e w±*iwh was timed to mature this spring, at wnich time it was calcul ated, the call to Jihad would have produced its fullest effect, and the Persian Government would have found itself either dragged into the war on the side of Turkey or powerless to control the Gendarmerie. Then would have beenbeen th© iroirent for tnig Persian irilitary police force, lad by its Bwedisb officers, to have put itself at the head of a popular anti-British rovorent, in tfhich the Genian agents would have taJien their share, in cooperation with certain tribal chieftains. The following passages fror a telegraphic cor respondence between the German Legation at Teheran and the Genran Consul at Bushire which has failed into British hands leave^ but small doubt as to the purposes for which the arms and ammunition were intended, and mahe it abundant ly clear that the Swedish officers wdre parties to a in all plot which would nave probability embroiled Perisa in tne war, whether the Government of Teheran wished it or not. On the 1st of January last the German Charge d'Affaires telegraphed to the German Consul at 3usnire as follows:-'Thanks for news regarding arms, please henceforth do not manifest any further interest. Weapons will be fetched away for our secret objects,;' ^ 1 To this telegram Terr Listemann sent answer: - 'Weapons wore fetched away some days ago by Swedish officer.

Following from Shiraz dated 12th April “ Your telegram 792 B. “As you know definite proofs are difficult to produce in such cases, will try to formulate situation briefly. “ 1 know as a fact all Swedish officers who have been and who are piesent m lais aie pio-Oeiman and that they have openly expounded their views both to 1 ersians and Luropeans. Captain Xillander, for instance, told me himself that he regarded all Reuter s news as [group omitted] and ail German news as absolutely accurate, and that he had so informed his Persian officers and others. Major Pravitz lias recently given out that England is blockaded, Amir of Afghanistan assassinated and many other such rumours all calculated to do us injury. And I could cpiote many similar instances. at \\ ith regard to Captain Oertingren 1 have received information from four different sources regarding his anti-British propaganda at Kazerun. 1 have seen letter written by financial agent there to acting controller of finances, Shiraz, an Armenian, giving detailed account of O.’s interview with Nasred Diva. This letter, which was written by Persian subordinate to his chief, entirely corroborates information received from our telegraph signaller and from Stas. 1 also tackled Governor of Kazerun who was present at interview in question and who is now on visit to Shiraz on the subject a few days ago, and he admitted substantial accuracy of accusations. “ There is also suspicious affair of arms and ammunition referred to in Bushire telegram 90 C. which has not yet been explained as far as 1 know. “ Then whole of Persian gendarmerie officers are rabidly pro-German and anti-British. They openly associate with Wassmuss and have committed themselves in many other ways. I have ample proof of this and it cannot be denied even by Swedes themselves. “ So even if we give Swedish officers credit for wishing to restrain their Persian officers we must at the same time admit that they are incapable of doing so. Major Pravitz in conversation with me this morning told me some 800 men of Pars regiment of gendarmerie are of lurkish origin and that if there were rising in south or if Turks advanced beyond Ahwaz nothing could prevent them from rising also. “ If then we suppose Swedes are not purposely conducting campaign against us in German interests, actual consequences of their pro-German attitude are same as far as we are concerned as il they were doing so , and gendarmerie under these officers constitutes a very senous menace to oui interests in Southern Persia and to neutrality of country in geneial. “Addressed to Cox, repeated to Tehran.”r jt v 1 .i.

Please see my telegrams Nos. 532, 541, 568, 650, and 675. I submit that following items collectively constitute strong case. First, sudden removal by Swedes under most secret arrangements of a large quantity of arms and ammunition which German Consul's correspon dence moves to have been intended for secret purposes of the German Legation. If they were intended for Gendamerie then there was absolutely no reason for secrecy or for German Consul or Legation to have any con nection with the matter. As it was, Lundberg who came to fetch them observed utmost secrecy and though he had many friends in Bushire saw no one except the German Consul with whom lie stayed. Secondly, on 13th February, 17th February and 21st February, German Legation telegraphed German Consul to collect all money possible and remit to 'Tehran for official purposes through Swedish officers, mentioning Lundberg and Pravitz by name. Thirdly, on 11th March Pravitz telegraphed peremptory message to Resident demanding release of German Consul, a matter which did not properly concern him at all. Fourthly, on 17th March Shiraz reported P. had sent telegram by Persian line to Gendarmerie at Borasjun ordering Gendarmerie there to prevent landing of British at Bushire. Fifthly, Oertengren paid two visits to Khan of Shabankara and though place is off the road and it is not part of bis duties to go there. After him his lieutenant, Ali Quli Khan, paid two moie visits, all with the object of getting Khan, who is on bad terms with Borasjun, to make peace in order to join in attack on Bushire or Haider Khan._ Oertengren was unable to give any satisfactory explanation of these visits when taxed by First Assistant at interview on 25th March.

(End of R.) (Confidential.) From what Minister for Foreign Affairs has said to my French colleague and to me, it is evident that Swedish Government are very sore about accusations made against Swedish officers, to whom he had, through officer commanding, given orders to observe strictest neutrality. He has said more than once that, while it served no interest of Sweden to keep officers in Persia, he always hoped that they would be able to act as a sort of buffer between conflicting British and Russian interests there. I have replied that, while we appreciated good organising work done, it was not possible any longer, in view of evidence, to close eyes to the fact that many of them sympathised openly with our enemies, which, considering the known sentiments of officers of Swedish army, was not surprising.

The Swedish officers at Shiraz are reported to have declared themselves definitely hostile to His Majesty’s Government, and one of their number recently proceeded down the road to Bushire openly advocating a rising against the British. Moreover, papers found among the effects of a German show that the gendarmerie are urging the native khans to attack Bushire. His Majesty’s Government bring these facts to notice of Swedish Government with all the greater regret as the Swedish Government were recently so good as to sanction, at their request, the retention of certain Swedish officers in Persia. In view, however, of the situation that has now developed, His Majesty’s Government are unable to give their support any longer to the Swedish officers in Southern Persia, and would be grateful if the Swedish Government would instruct them to withdraw from those districts where His Majesty’s Government cannot but regard their presence as avowedly inimical to British interests.r 7T o- ^ From Sir P.

In Januaiy, a consignment oi 1,400 cases of arms and ammunition and bombs which had arrrived year before for gendarmerie were removed from Bushire by gendarmerie in a secretive manner which excited good deal of comment. At the same time 200,000 rounds which had been deposited at Mohammerah were sent to Ahwaz for despatch thence to Ispahan. They were, however, detained at Ahwaz by Sheikh of Mohammerah and have been since sent back to Mohammerah since the arrival of our troops. It is evident despatch of these munitions of war was connected with German scheme, which presumably was that in early spring, by which time jihad cry would have produced its maximum effect, and Persian Government would either have been dragged in with Turkey or left powerless to control gendarmerie, the latter —led by Swedes —would place themselves at head of popular anti-British movement in which German agents in Bushire, and hinterland chiefs in collusion with them, would have played their part. It was hoped that this movement would cause conflagration in Afghanistan and India.

Captain Oertingren informed Nasred Dewa and Governor of Kazerun jn presence of financial Agent, that Sweden and Norway and Denmark would join war against allies and that moment had come for Persians to free themselves from foreign domination and to drive out English. Latter had paid son of Amir of Afghanistan to kill his father and eldest brother, but Afghans had revolted and had army of 360,000 men ready to attack India and Russia. Nasred replied that he was ready to serve his country and awaited orders from Teheran. Oertingren said that it was useless to await orders as the English and Russians had corrupted the Persian Minister. “ Stas also confirms information previously received that Oertingren has written and spoken to various Khans in similar sense requesting them to have Tufungehis ready to attack English. Present Governor of Kazerun is former Gendarmerie Officer, and is said to have been specially sent to Kazerun to assist in their plans. Stas says people in general do not desire disturbances, but gendarmes and the disorderly element will welcome opportunity of pillage.

[341-1574]CONFIDENTIAL. y \ SWEDEN Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Howard (Stockholm). (No. 58.) R. Foreign Office, March 23, 1915, 11 p.m. YOU should inform Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government have received evidence which, to their great regret, shows clearly that Swedish officers in Southern Persia have recently abandoned attitude of neutrality which His Majesty’s Government were entitled to expect from officials serving under Persian Government. The Swedish officers at Shiraz are reported to have declared themselves definitely hostile to His Majesty’s Government, and one of their number recently proceeded down the road to Bushire openly advocating a rising against the British. Moreover, papers found among the effects of a German show that the gendarmerie are urging the native khans to attack Bushire. His Majesty’s Government bring these facts to notice of Swedish Government with all the greater regret as the Swedish Government were recently so good as to sanction, at their request, the retention of certain Swedish officers in Persia. In view, however, of the situation that has now developed, His Majesty’s Government are unable to give their support any longer to the Swedish officers in Southern Persia, and would be grateful if the Swedish Government would instruct them to withdraw from those districts where His Majesty’s Government cannot but regard their presence as avowedly inimical to British interests. ,341 -1742</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00017b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/484</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00017b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/484</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 3516/1914 Pt 7 'German War: Persia'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1915/1915</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-21T22:58:58</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (257 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 259; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
