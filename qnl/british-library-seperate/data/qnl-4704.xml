Near the beginning of the file the Political Agent states a preference for Humber models as the Agency's official cars (specifically a Super Snipe Saloon and a Super Snipe Station Wagon), since the Government of Bahrain already possesses several of these vehicles, and therefore servicing facilities would be available. The file largely consists of the Political Agent's correspondence with a number of car distributors and agents, both in Bahrain and in Britain, regarding the purchase and shipment of the Humber and Austin vehicles. Also discussed is the Political Agent's request for two pick-up trucks for the Political Agency on the Trucial Coast (no purchases of such vehicles are documented in this file).Correspondents include the following: the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Rootes Limited (car manufacturers and distributors, London); A A Zayani and Sons (general merchants and commission agents, Bahrain); the Commonwealth Relations Office, Whitehall, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Rootes Motors Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Trucial Coast Political Agency</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>A A Zayani and Sons, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Cars</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016c#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
