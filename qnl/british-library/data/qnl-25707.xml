Department, of Education, Health and Lands. j * J o b ^ &lt;? Delhi, the January, 193b. Please refer to your demi-official letter Jsso. P.z. 6508/35, dated the 19th September 1935 to Acheson regarding a building grant to the Church of Scotland School at Sheikh othman, Aden. It is presumed that this school is the same as the Keith Falconer Mission Anglo-Vernacular School ®t Sheikh Othman for which a building grant of Rs. 3,558 was approved by the Government of Bombay in 1931 as an administrative measure on the under standing that it would be paid if and when funds permitted. Subject to the vote of the Legislative Assembly, a sum of Rs. 3,558 is being provided in the budget estimates of Aden for 1936-37 for the payment of this grant during that year. Yours sincerely, i.J. Clauson, Esquire, India Office, London.My dear Clanson, I enclose a copy of correspondence regarding a grant of Rs.3,000 promised as a contribution towards the cost of rebuilding the Church of Scotland School at Sheikh Othman at Aden. You will see that our Secretary of State has promised to make enquiries on the matter and write again to Mr. Graham Kerr. This is a question v/hich falls within your province, and perhaps you will leo us know what reply should be sent. If, as I daresay is probable, you should have to refer to the Government of India, will you let me know, so that Mr. MacDonald can send a further reply explaining that a reference to India will be necessary, and that some time will therefore elapse before a final answer is possible, Yours sincerely. M. J. CLAUSON, ESQ.,COPY. THE UNIVERSITY, GLASGOW. 5th September, 1935. The Right Hon. Malcolm MacDonald, Colonial Office, i London, S.W.l. Dear Mr. MacDonald, I have a letter from a constituent - Dr. Robert Napier, North House, Sheikh Othman, Aden - who is Treasurer of the Church of Scotland School at Sheikh Othman and who is anxious regarding a grant of Rs. 3000 agreed to by the Government of Bombay as a contribution towards the cost of rebuilding the school destroyed by the flood of 1927. Dr. Napier states that at the time of transference of Aden to the Colonial Office the Government of India (which had accepted the liability) had not yet paid over the money and he is wondering what steps should be taken to secure that this small matter shall not be overlooked Perhaps you would kindly have enquiries made and advise me how to reply to Dr. Napier. Yours sincerely, ( SGI) *) J- GRAHAM KERR. M.P. Scottish Universities.Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W.l. 9th September, 1935.
