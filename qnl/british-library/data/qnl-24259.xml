The r akhudha ir eclately went to the boat and was allowed to talce charge of his personal belongings and money.

Her heirs were her cousin Fatimah bint •Abdullah of Ha© al nhairnah and her husband ‘Ubaid bin Khalfan. jach was to receive half her estate. i* 0 this * Ubaid bin Khalfan agreed after the shaikh of Has al nheimah had intervened on her behalf.

He deferred payment of the remaining Us. 1,000/— J or three nonthc after the expiry of which period the onaikh of Has al Khalnah again intervened on her behalf. In spite of this ‘Ubaid bin Khalfan refused to pay the Hu 1,000/- still due to Fatinah bint ‘Abdullah, in consequence the shaikh of Has al nhaimali sent his representative to Lingah to represent her claim there before some oilicial of the Iranian Government.

Salim was allowed to take charge of his personal belongings and money from the boat • 3. ^hen clalim remonstrated with 1 -bald and his party he was informed that they had acted in retaliation for a previous alleged aet of aggression committed by Shaikh &gt;ultan of Has Political Resident in the Persian Quit Subject! Rei*ure of Has «1 F haimah dhow at SIRRI JSLAKD. Sirill Klmiaati, wiios* »abject Salim we®. Salim appealed to tne Iranian Director of Cuatoma ©n Sirri Island who nad witMSSii the whole incident. The latter, however, either could not or would not intervene on behalf of Salim, who was forced to borrow a boat from Saif bin HibaU for his return journey to Ka* al KJtaaijaah« leaving his o^n boat behind. 1 have the details of the grievance of ’lib&amp;id and hi® party against the Shaikh but 1 need not trouble you with it at length since, whether it is real or imaginery, it in no way afreets the somewhat serious point at issue (see paragraph 4 below). Oae point however in this dispute between 1 Ubald and h&amp;ikh Sultan is of some little importance. the reason of the dispute between the two parties wae a certain debt which a subject of the Shaikh claimed against ’Dbaid and which the latter refused to pay up the last fts.lOOQ/-. Ttie Shaikh, ^ date is not stated but prtsuraably it wa« fairly recently, sent his representative to IJngah to represent the claim before some official of the Iranian Sovernment. This latter official deputed his representative to ge to Birri island together with the representative of the Ohaikh to settle the matter, and an agreement was reached that * Ubaid should pay part of the balance in full settlement of the claim. ’Ubaid paid part of th^ balance hnt refused to pay ths whole and pressure was brought to bear on him by the representative of the Bhaikh, which resulted in a settlement of the claim. It wae in revenge for this pressure that 1 Ubaid too*- his action in seising Salim’s boat. 4. Most of the inhabitants of Birri Island are Arabs connected with the Trucial Coast and such quarrels between tas Arabs do not normally concern us. In this case, however, the dispute is complicated by the fact that the Iranian Government /GoTernment *r« in facto yoBaeaaion of tne island, tnougn wo Hava novor acknowledged tfteir position d.f corroopondenco end witn par^grapn 5 oi your preloceer or* e Koto 'lo.526 f dated the 2lot normher 1931# to tne Persian Hiniotor for Foreign Affairs# forwarded to me unior Teftran Prlntod letter Ko.234 f 21st for ember 1931). if we permit the Island to remain in the possession of the Iranian Govern ment the least the latter can do is to prevent incident® of the nature reported abnre recurring. AO you will see the representative of the director of Customs on Sirri Island did nothing to help Salim and what adds to the responsibility of the Iranian Gower ament is that - vide paragraph 3 above - the arrangement come to as to the debt between *Ubaid and the subject of the Shaikh of as al Khaim*h was made under Iranian authority. 5. The Shaikh of las al Chaimah has not unnaturally sent in a very strong protest to me, hinting that if we cannot obtain redress for him he will be unable to prevent his people taking the law into their own hands. I should think that this eventuality is far from unlikely. 1 venture to suggest therefore that the Iranian Government should be urged to arrange for the return of the boat and for some compensation to be paid by the culprits to Salim. In the meantime with a view to keeping the i haikh and his people from taking retaliatory action X am informing him that I have reported the matter to you for representation to the Iranian Government. 6. Tou will notice that the incident occurred on the 15th Kovember. The delay in reporting it has been inevitable since things move slowly on the Truci&amp;l Coast, and after the first report had been received the important point had to be confirmed /confirmed ae to whether there was an Iranian repreeentatire on the leland when the incident occurred. &gt; I mm eending « copy of this letter to His Hajesty** Secretary of State for India, the Oorernment of Iniia and the Political Agent, Bahrain.

As a result of their enquiries, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf conclude that the seizure of the Ras al Khaimah dhow at Sirri Island in November 1935 was an act of retaliation by the islanders against the intervention of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim [Al Qasimi, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim] the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah some years earlier, in a dispute over inheritance involving one of his subjects, who was a relative and beneficiary of the estate of the deceased wife of Ubaid bin Khalfan al Aqrubi. The main correspondents investigating the incident are: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire, both the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, and the Residency Agent at Sharjah whose reports are in Arabic as well as in English. Their correspondence includes both Arabic and English copies of letters and a statement made by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, and also of a witness statement made by the nakuda Salim bin Abdullah. The file ends with correspondence in 1936 relating to the settlement of the disputed inheritance and the return of the seized dhow to its owner, with the assistance of the Iranian authorities. Included in the latter correspondence are letters exchanged between officials at the British Legation in Tehran and both the Foreign Office and India Office in London, as well as a letter (in English translation) from the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tehran, regarding the attitude of the British Government towards the Iranian Government’s claim to sovereignty over Sirri Island.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sirri</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Inheritance and succession</topic></subject><subject><topic>Seizure of vessels and cargoes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000267#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
