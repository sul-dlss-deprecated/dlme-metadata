In answer to my enquiries the Muscat Government state that the non-receipt by Saiyld T&amp;rig and his mother of his allowance since March last has been due solely to their failure to notify their change of address. It appears that the Bombay .Branch of the imperial B&amp;nK of India by whom these allowances are paid on behalf of the Muscat Government, in April last sent the usual quarterly allowance to the last address given by Saiyid larig and his mother but in May their letter was returned as the addressees could not be found, keanwhile a talegrain had been received from the mother giving their new address. The Muscat Government state that instructions have now been issued to the Imperial Bank of India in Bombay to / forward forthwith to Baiyid Tarig his allowance for the two- 2 - quarters ending June 30th to the address given. 3. There is no question of discontinuing this allowance. funds for which are provided for in the State Budget.
