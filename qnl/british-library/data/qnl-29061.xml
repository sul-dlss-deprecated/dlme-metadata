Dear Mr. Meloy, V»iXl you please refer to Mr, Bailey's letter i»o#710/fealdo E Lailey/Lg, dated the £5th June 1947, on the subject of the jurisdiction exercised by his hajesty's Government in the Trucial Shaikhdoms, tjatar and Bahrain. E. The jurisdiction of Jiis Majesty's Government over British subjects and foreigners in the Trucial Sheikhdoms is based on custom and usage, which was confirmed in 1945 by letters from the various hulers the Trucial Coast according their formal consent to the exercise of such jurisdiction. on 3. Similarly the jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government in Qatar was recognised in 1935 by a formal letter from the Ruler of Qatar recognising such jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners other than Eoslem foreigners not being British Subjects. 4. The jurisdiction of ills Majesty's Government over British subjects in Bahrain vbb recognised in a Convention entered into in 1861 between His Majesty's Government and the Ruler of Bahrain. Similar jurisdiction over foreigners is exercised by virtue of a formal letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain in 1909 requesting His Majesty's Government to exercise jurisdiction over them. Yours sincerely, Sd/- A.C. Galloway. //, PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN the 5th September 1947 Copy forwarded with compliments to:- r Commonwealth 1.

Galloway is rather too abrupt and may provoke further representations from the State Department. There is no reason why we should not be willing to quote the correspondence insofar as Bahrein and the Trucial States are concerned, but in the case of Qatar, you will see from the correspondence flagged in the volume ^y&amp;tlached that made it a comJwGion of approving ^ the/Iraq Petroleum Company's oil concession in Qatar that the Sheikh should cede jurisdiction over all British subjects and non Muslim foreigners.

CONFIDENTIAL THE FOREIGN SERVICE /« OF THE ] UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ( AMERICAN CONSULATE, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, June 25, 1947. Lieutenant Colonel A. C. Galloway, Acting Political Resident in Persian Gulf, Bahrein Islands. My dear Colonel Galloway, Reference is made to the British publication Statutory Rules and Orders 1946 No. 2260 - Foreign Juris* diction - Trucial States. This publication begins : » Whereas by Treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means His Majesty the King has jurisdiction within the territories of the Rulers of Dubai, Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah, Ajman, Umm al Qawain, Abu Dhabi and Kalba: n . I am aware of the treaties and agreements under which the British Government has protection over the foreign relations of the Trucial States, but I am not aware of any treaty or agreement giving the British Government jurisdiction within the territories of the Trucial States which will permit the application of the laws of British India and of the United Kingdom to the area of the Trucial States. It may be that such jurisdiction has been acquired by 'usage” or 'suffe- or it is possible that jurisdictional agreements were made at the end of the First World Vvar. I would greatly appreciate receiving any infor mation on this subject both in regard to the Trucial Coast and also concerning the related situations in Qatar and Bahrein Islands. With kind regards, I am, Sincerely yours, Sd. WALDO E. BAILEY. American Consul. cc: American Legation, Jidda. CONFIDENTIALSECRET D.O. No. 1101 - S. ^ -W^IAN GULF RESIDENCY, v BAHRAIN. the '30th November, 1946 My dear Harrison When I was at home I was asked on two or three occasions whether there was any appeal from the Gulf Courts to any Court in India. I replied that so far as I was aware there was no such appeal, and I am now able to confirm this. 2. For practical purposes the only occasion when any reference has to be made to India in a judicial case is when a death sentence is passed c.f. Article 16 of the Bahrain Order in Council. Some other provision will have to be made for the confirmation of such sentences when control passes from the Government of India to His Majesty*s Government. 3. The Governor General in Council is also mentioned in the following Articles in the Bahrain Order in Council and in corresponding Articles in the other Orders in Council : 14(1), 21(3) , 22(6), and 35(1). There should be little difficulty in making appropriate omjrfissions of amendments when the change-over takes place. 4. Provision will also probably have to be made for another 'British Possession' to be substituted for Bombay in Article 16 of the Bahrain Order in Council and the corresponding Article in the other Orders in Council.

Record of Bahrain criminal case No.154 of 1935 shows that conviction is almost entirely based on evidence of one person who was himself undergoing trial and who refused to repeat in Court statement he made to Adviser. It is opposed to principles of justice to execute a capital sentence on basis of uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice whose statement is practically withdrawn. Governor General in Council has accordingly decided that sentences of death passed by Sessions Judge, Bahrain, on Hajji Abu Hamad, Muhammad bin Sultan and Ahmed bin Muhammad should be commuted to .seven years imprisonment in each case.

Q. ) j I think v/e should avoid saying anything in the telegram which assumes that the power of extradition e.cists at any rate in regard to places in the Persian GuI-l. As regards British India, the powers undoubtedly exist under Chapter II of the Indian Extradition Act, the procedure being laid down in section 3 or section 4* The Extradition Act of 1870 could only affect fugitive criminals of a foreign state who are in or suspected of being in any part of His Majesty’s Dominions or, under section 17, in a ’’British Possession” which is defined in Section 26 as any colony, plantation, is&amp;ind territory or settlement within His Majesty’s Dominions. This would therefore seem to exclude the places in the Persian Gulx. A reference to the various orders in Council relating to the Persian Gulf shows that though the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 is made applicable, the Extradition Act 1870 is not. The Indian Extradition Act 1903 is not one of the Indian Acts applied in the Orders in Council. In the Persian Coasts 1907 and Islands Order in Council,/the Maskat Order in Council and the Bahrein Order in Council 1913 1915,/there is a provision that nothing in the order is to affect the powers of jurisdiction conferred by the (Indian) Foreign jurisdiction and Extradition Act 1879 ot in the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council 1902. That Act of 1879 was repealed by the Indian Extradition Act of 1903, and was therefore not in being when these Orders in Council came into force. As regards the Kuwait Order in Council 1925, the corresponding provision is that nothing in the Order shall affect any power or jurisdiction conferred by the Indian Extradition Act 1903, but in my opinion that is only intended to preserve the rights and powers as regards the surrender of fugitive criminals under the procedure in Chapter III of the Indian Extradition Act, which corresponds to the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881.2 There would seem to he no power, so far as I can see in regard to the places in the Persian Gulf, by which a legal extradition order could be made. I suggest that the Foreign Office might be consulted on the point, and if they agree, the information to that effect might be communicated to the U.S.A. Embassy, and the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. (Sd.) H.G. PEARSON 22.3.34 Mr. Insull will not presumably have a visa for any of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Gulf, and cannot land without one. I doubt if we can do more than instruct the Resident to prevent him from landing and to report at once any information as to his movements. I suggest an alteration in the draft on these lines in which the Foreign Office and their Legal Adviser concur. I think it desirable to repeat the telegram to Aden and to ask the Government of India to authorise the Chief Commissioner to take any necessary steps. A difficult question arises in the case of Kamaran. I have added a satence (in which the Foreign Office and Colonial Office concur) to cover this. (Sd.) J.G.

Subject therefore to any further observations which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may have to offer, he proposes to authorise the issue of instructions on the lines which the (rovernment of India suggest, viz: to register British Protected Persons proper such as subjects of Indian States who reside or make a prolonged stay ai Bahrein. There/There would appear to be little utility in registering at Bahrein the floating population, which apparently increases largely during the pearling season, and is not regularly resident a-t Bahrein; and it will be observed that it is stated that the extra work involved would involve the entertainment of an . additional cl eak, which be out ‘ /» of the question at the present timev y Moreover many of these persons ap^M, btc Hadramautis^who apparently need not be necessarilyyregarded as British Protected Persons in the narrower sense of the term (compare F.O. despatch to Cairo of 9th April 1931, No.338), and there may be others whose status is similar. It would appear doubtful whether such persons should be regarded as falling within the class of 'British Protected Persons' who are included in the definition of ,f British Subjects' in the Bahrein O.in C.

Bahrein Order in Council* Sir, With reference to letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.F. 132-N/31, dated the 1st August 19 31, copy of which was sent to you with my weekly letter No.lOS-M, dated the 6th August 1931, I am directed to forward for your information a copy of Political Resident’s letter No.1762 of 1931, dated the 22nd August 19 31. 2. The Government of India consider that for the reasons stated by the Political Resident it is unnecessary to register Hadramautis etc. who, though British protected persons in the wider sense of the term, need not be regarded as such for the purposes of registration cf. the analogous treatment accorded to this class in Egypt referred to in letter from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office No.89092/31 dated the 31st March 1931* British protected persons proper should however in the opinion of the Government of India be registered. If the Secretary of State concurs in this opinion, instructions will be issued accordingly. I have the honour to be.

Bahrain Order in Council Sir, I have the honour to to refer to paragraph 1 of your letter NO.F.132-N/31, dated the 1st August 1931, asking that arrangements should be made to have British protected persons registered in future as well as British subjects proper. 2. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who has lately visited here, and with whom I discussed the matter, informed me that there is ^ in Bahrain a large floating population fron^Aden, th ' ' lut, and other places, which would have to be registered, and of which he estimated the numbers to be about 5000 during the pearling season. The registration of these people would present serious difficulties. Many arrive without papers, and this absence of documentary evidence by necessitating investigations would entail a great deal of extra work. The Political Agents staff is already fully employed, and cannot be expected to cope with this accession to their ordinary duties, so the appointment of an extra clerk for the purpose would therefore be necessary. Moreover^* the record when completed, based as it would be 0 n oral evidence, would be hardly reliable, and in -die opinion of the Political Agent would serve no useful purpose. 3« In the past, according to my information, no ill effect had resulted from these people being left unregistered; and underunder the circumstance© I agree with the Political Agent that their registration is not worth the expenditure involved, I would accordingly recommend the Government of India that registration should be confined in future, as hitherto* to British subjects proper. 4, The murder case referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter was one in which the accused was a Bahrain subject and the victim an Iraq subject. Under Section 44 (1) (b) of the Order in Council the case was tried in the Joint Court. The accused was sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out by the Bahrain Government in Bahrain. Had the accused been a person to whom the Order in Council applied the case would have been tried before the Political Agent as Sessions Judge and the sentence of death referred under Section 15 of the Order in Council for confirmation to the Governor General of India in Council.

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. F.V. Wylie, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.q+jt i h I discussed these two cases to-day with Mr. Belgrave, the Financial Adviser in Bahrein, of whom Colonel Biscoe had already suggested that enquiries might be made on the question of procedure in murder cases. Mr. Belgrave says that death sentences, when passed by the Sheikh, are carried into execution by shooting, and that he, as Financial Adviser, is required to be present. There have been four or five such cases in the last two or three years. I understood him to say that there had in fact been an execution recently arising out of a death sentence passed by the Political Agent’s Court and he added that he understood that one deathsentence had been passed /in the last four months, and that another murder case was pending. He could not, however, say what had been the fate of the pers on condemned in the first instance, nor was he clear as to the general procedure. On the question of registration I understand from him that in fact there is considerable laxity about the registration of British-protected persons, but here again he is noo in a position to speak definitely.

Z.3809/31 of the 18th June regarding the murder case at in 1930. Paragraph 2 of your letter confirms our own impression that the matter is one in which responsibility rests with India rather than with us. We feel, however, that the point is one on which it is desirable that there should be no uncertainty, more particularly as the report enclosed in your letter No. P.Z. 2396/31 of April 21st stated that the murderer had been condemned to death. In these circumstances we hope that you will not mind ascertaining from India what exactly happened about this murder case. Yours sincerely, E.P. Donaldson, Esq..,)JL ^ ^ FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 23rd June, 1931. yiff ^ Your letter P.Z. 3294/31 of the 9th instant, relative to the registration of British protected persons in Bahrein. , . y It occurs to us that confusion has perhaps arisen in this matter owing to failure to distinguish between British protected persons and the classes of foreigners who are not British protected persons, but who are persons to whom the Bahrein Order in Council applies. You will see from the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, that the words ’’British subject” include British protected Persons, (Article's), and then, coming on to Article 8 , which defines the powers conferred by the Order, it is provided that they shall extend to (l) British subjects, (i.e. British subjects in the strict sense of the word, and British protected persons) and (2) foreigners with J.G. Laithwaite, Esq.,respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for the exercise of jurisdiction hy His Majesty and (5) certain Bahrein subjects, and it is then provided in paragraph 4 of Article 8 that the expression 'person to whom this Order applies' covers all the three classes of persons above mentioned. Article 51 of the 1913 Order provided for a register of all persons to whom the Order applied, that is to say, a register of all persons coming in any of the three classes mentioned above, and including therefore the very large number of foreigners mentioned in your letter, but later, by the Order in Council of 1922, Article 51 of the 1913 Order was repealed and the registration provisions of the Order confined to British subjects, and this means British subjects and protected persons, or in other words Class (l) only of the classes of persons to whom the Order applies. Under the present provisions of the Order, all the numerous foreigners coming in Classes ( 2 ) and (3) of ArticleArticle 8 of the 1913 Order are not to he registered, hut British subjects and British protected persons are still to he registered. The expression '‘British 'protected person' here no doubt hears the ordinary meaning of a native of an Indian native State or of the protectorates or mandated territories of His Majesty. We do not suppose that the inclusion of these people would very much increase the numbers of persons to he registered.(g&gt; 1KD1A OFFICE # WIBULL, S/#. 1. 16th Jun^, 1931 • Dewr I W*&lt;*r\ holdini^ un a r^ily to your letter of the 16th ray, K 210C/2ICC/91, about the murder caa* in ^hrotr de-lt tfllh in 1980, uafitil we had an opportunity of dittouftftin^ the point with the Political Hcnidant, Oolmol Biecoo Ba;/o, howetrar, th«t he has no recollection of the execution of any death contone*, or of any aueh c^ntenc© havii\^ »&gt;ren referred to him for eonfirmtion* undantand that a sentence of thie kind pas80&lt;I by the Court of tite Political A^ant Bitting as a Saesiona Judge would have to bo re&gt; erred to tne Govomor^Oonoral in Council for con&gt; irmation, but it flight be that tho care w^ts aent for trial to Bombay, under Article 16 of the Order in Council, and in that of ant if % sentence of death wore passed it wouid hay# been carried out in India.

There is one more point arising out of the report of the working of the Order in Council in 1930. According to paragraph 3, one murder case was dealt with in 1930 and the murderer was sentenced to death. We have been wondering whether the murderer was in fact executed and also what is the exact procedure in the case of death sentences. The Order-in-Council is not clear on the latter point and, though we imagine that death sentences have to be confirmed in India by the Governor General in Council, we should be glad to know the exact position. Can you very kindly enlighten me? Yours sincerely, E.P.Donaldson,S sq.r-Jt '* u r 1.-4.32*4/31 f i- 6 itiDiA Oman, MitT&amp;OU., B.W.l. 9th Juno,1931.

In 1925 the Political Agent reported that 'Foreigners under British protection in Bahrein under the Order in Council number some 30,000 to 40,000.- They are not registered.* A similar statement appeared in the report for 1926, but subsequent reports contented themselves with the statement that 'foreigners under British protection are not registered' and we have thus no later figures thtn those of 1926 of the probable number of such foreigners. The foreigners in question are almost certainly, according to the Political Heiident, who is now on Isa vs, and with whom the question has been discussed, practically exclusively Persians and Nejdis living in Bahrein, whose interests are looked afterDraft Paper. Department. DRAFT LETTER. G.R.Warner , Esq.,C.M.G., Foreign Office, Dear Warner, S.W.l. Would you kindly refer to your official letter of 20th May, Uo.T. 6340/173/378,on the question of the registration in the same way as (njviv* * ftl tqiX~ (thC 'qrj HI Uj2t 4p&gt; &lt;fIo Pn^(^ ■ 5155 5000 2/31 British subjects of British protected persons in Bahrein. On looking through the previous annual reports on the operation of the Bahrein Order in Council for the period since 1923, I find that the first registration of British subjects in accordance with the provisions of the amending Order in Council of 1922 was carried out during 1923, the number registered being 550. This number has been fairly constant since and appears in no year to have exceeded It represents actual British born subjects only. In submitting the first report,^the Political Agent, Bahrein, made this clear, and added &lt; 'The number of persons to whom the * Bahrein Order applies,including foreigners under British protection, amounts probably to some 40,000, increasing in the diving season to 60,000 to 70,000.' In 1925 the Political Agent reported that 'Foreigners under British protection in Bahrein under the Order in Council numb er/'number some 3C,C00 to 40,000. They are not registered. M A similar statement appeared in the report for 1926, but subsequent reports contented themselves with the statement that 'foreigners under British protection are not regist ered’’and we have thus no later figures than those of 192&lt;* of the probable number of such foreigners. The problem io olearly a very large one- an4 it is obvi ous 'that arrangements for the registration and renewal of registration of 30,000 or 40,000 people a year (to say nothing of the numerous individuals enjoying British protection who find themselves in the islands during the pearl diving season in the summer) would be likely to necessitate a very substantial increase of the Political Agent’s staff and to add considerably to his work. Subject to your further observations we should, I think, in these circumstances on the whole be disposed to leave matters as they are unless the Foreign Office feel strongly that the possibility of ^j-egistrati on of prefroetud pciauno should be examined V*/ T&amp;*- y U«ZK4A' iaM^ox a+kJiAi/i aajl U+luk °AA^ A ' l*( Ufa- P-A t ^ CjMCA^ OA-C- fc**-*l \4A tU.

Sir, Mi With reference to your letter No. P.Z.2396/31 of the 21st April, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to state that his attention has been drawn to paragraph 5 of the report, enclosed in the letter of 17th March, 1931, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India, on the working of the Bahrein Order in Council in 1930. 2. According to that paragraph, foreigner s under British protection are not registered. The Secretary of State is advised, however, that the Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council, 1922, which under the terms of paragraph 1 thereof is to be read as one with the Bahrein Order in Council 1913, provides in effect for the registration of British protected persons, since article 4 of the principal order, which is still in force, defines ’British subjects’ as including British protected persons. 3. In these circumstances I am to suggest that, if Mr. Secretary Benn sees no objection, instructions should now be issued to the effect that British protected persons in Bahrein should in future be registered in the same way as British subjects.

Jurisdiction over British Subjects. 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government -provides that “ all offences which they (British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.” Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty’s Government; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty’s Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty’s Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty’s Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that “Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. \\ Onckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. “As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Lr. d. 4 May 1901 , Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a £ VS LD ^ eQ 72 matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any of 9 May 1901 ^ disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the p - 614/61 - event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.” r Ihe action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved Secret Desp. to by His Majesty’s Government. “ G - of I -&gt; No - 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. p '“ 063/01 - Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows “ In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with Lr.fromG of i to the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be Poi.Re8.,No.ii56E, referred to the British authorities.

Xo dispute involving. the question of jurisdiction over foreigners appears to have arisen in Bahrein until H)0i. In 1904-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the first of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Whine k ha us—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which he suffered personal injuries. Failing, as he thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom his first complaint was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and I cannot say anything on the subject.” The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, and that a Butish ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquirv might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Kesideut “for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” . second.case (November 1901), an accidental quarrel bavin' arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh’s nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for suppoi t to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty’s Minister and the Muskir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as “I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.” The Sheddi, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of juiisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference “ in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans,” and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to IIis Excellency. He accepted the demands of His Majesty’s Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the I optical Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established as a a matter of practice, m respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order m Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners m the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein C fV le u d th , at \\ ': as d ® 8,ra ! ),e t0 0 . btain . a formal request Iron, the bheikh that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners After discussion With the Political Agent. His ICxcellency addressed the latter on Kith July 009, in the following terms After compliments. It is not hidden from you that I have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and J would lie grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me I mean that it (the British Government) should exeicise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and mv subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them jointly.” 8. 1 he Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation con Limed in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh’s letter, “As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and gives loieigneis the same treatment that British subjects now receive there seems no need for exception to be taken to it.” 9. 1 be Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of 10th July 1J0J, giving jurisdiction over ioreigners to the British Government, was intended only “to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents ol petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimsto have special arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance .of each others direct jurisdiction. I informed him that if lie could produce agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged then validity, 1 thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article S of the Oidei in Council of 1913) the power conferred by the Order extends to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— (1) 1 British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2) foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed inth Ilis Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. 1 he expression ‘person to whom this Order applies’ shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) 1 he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and of: Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- (3) (^) ( 6 ) Article (2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order: provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows : — “ (a) Criminal. Article 41.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (б) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed bv him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 1861.* * See para. 1 above. Viceroy’s tel. to S. of S. for India of 6 July 1912, re peating tel. from Pol. Res.: P. 2632/12.Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and ^ (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (б) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent of the several parties, may refer the case to one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (e) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Nazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.” P. 5040/20.

At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests w r ere received from Ibn Saud as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920 a notice that ah foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The decision w'as not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested wdth the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended.

Z, ! t_D I have.the honour to state that the Political Agent at Bahrein has requested that he may be invested with special powers under Section 30 o’f the Criminal Procedure Code. 2. Section 14(l) of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, confers on the Political Agent the powers of a District Magistrate and Sessions Judge. As District Magistrate the Political Agent can try cases shown in the 8 th column of the second Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code as triable by a District Magistrate, but under Section 3^,(1) (a) of the Code his powers of inflicting punishment are limited to a maximum of imprisonment for a terra not exceeding two years and fine not exceeding Rs.1,000/-. As Sessions Judge he is empowered by Section 31(2) of the code to pass any sentence authorised by law (death sentences being subject to confirmation by the Chief Court) but is obliged by Section 268 of the Code to conduct trials either by jury or with the aid of assessors. 3. The summoning of assessors is a matter of great difficulty in Bahrein owing to the limited number of suitable persons and the demands already made upon their time by the Majlis el Urfi (Civil Court) and the Majlis el Ghaus (Pearling Court). Much time is also spent in translating the proceedings to assessors in three or more languages. 4. If the Political Agent, as District Magistrate, is invested with special powers under Section 30 of the Code he will be able to try all offences not punishable with death without either jury or assessors and in the special conditions f Bahrein I consider it desirable that he should be empowered 5'^03) 5. It would appear that the Political Agent can be invested with the desired powers by a notification published by the Governor General in Council v/ho, under Section 14 (l) of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, exercises the powers of the local Government. I, therefore, request that, if the Government of India see no objection, the Political Agent, Bahrein, may be invested by notification with powers under Section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Copy of a letter 170.D.395-N/3Q, dated New Delhi, the 18th February 1930, from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian ananas Gulf, Bushire. Special powers to be invested to the Political Agent,Bahrein, under Section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Code. With reference to your letter No.121, dated the 18th January 1930, I am directed to say that section 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not co-extensive with the local extent of the Code as a whole but is restricted by the terms of the section itself to the territories specified therein. The definition of those territories is exhaustive and does not embrace Bahrein. The provision made by Section 14 of the Bahrein Order in Council to the effect that the Code of Criminal Procedure shall be applicable to Bahrein does not therefore have the effect of causing section 30 of the Code to be applicable to Bahrein. The section can however be rendered applicable to Bahrein by a King's Regulation, amending section 30 of the Code with respect to Bahreinjin such manner as to render the section applicable to Bahrein. 2 . I am **■■■ to request therefore that you will frame and submit a Regulation on the above lines.
