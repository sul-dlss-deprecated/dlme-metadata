No. 985, dated Bushire, the 5th (received 13th) April 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of Government, a copy of letter No. C-10, dated 23rd March 1914, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, in which he reports that Sir Mubarak-bln-Subah has expressed a wish to visit India and to include in the tour Cairo and London. 2. In the Political Agent's opinion, it would be advisable that Shaikh Sir Mubarak should leave Kuwait in January next, visit India and Egypt and arrive in England about the beginning of May. 3. It may be considered that with the Anglo-Turkish Convention still unratified and in the uncertainty that prevails in regard to the position at Hasa, it is a little early for Shaikh Sir Mubarak to be contemplating the idea of removing his powerful personality for however short a period from the Princi pality he governs so strongly and so well. There is, however, room for hope that the first of these questions will be settled before the date suggested for Shaikh Sir Mubarak's departure. Should, however, Government be disposed to entertain favourably the idea of the tour proposed, they will no doubt desire to be furnished with more detailed proposals than those now set forth. No. C.-io, dated Kuwait, the 23rd March 1914. From— Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to telegram No. 50-D., dated 28th January 1911, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department to your address, a copy of which was forwarded to this office with Bushire letter No. 946 of 1911, dated 1 ith April idem. 2. Shaikh Sir Mubarak has recently spoken to me of his wish t:o make a tour which should include Cairo and London in addition to the visit to India which has for so long been his ambition. I beg to request that you will kindly submit this project for the favourable consideration of the Government of India, who, I venture to hope, may be pleased to honour Sir Mubarak^with the invita tion to visit India, the future possibility of which was suggested in the telegram referred to above, and may also see their way to make such arrangements as may be necessary for the latter part of the projected tour. 3. The Shaikh's medical advisers are of opinion that he should not, for reasons of health, arrive in England before the summer season ; in the event of the tour being approved, it would, therefore, be convenient for him to leave Kuwait in January next, visit India in February, Egypt in March and April, and proceed to England early in May.

To Tna M ost H on'blb thh MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., Ris Majesty 9 s Secretary of State for India, S imla, the 28th May 1914, - my L ord mahqtruss, We have the honour to enclose, for Your Lordship's consideration, Letter No. 985, d^ted tiie 6th April 1914, with copy of a letter, noted in the margin, enclosure received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, reporting a desire expressed hy the Shaikh of Kuwait to visit India, Cairo and London. 2. In 19^5, Shaikh Mubarak expressed a desire to visit India, and the proposal, emanating from the Shaikh himself, was viewed favourably by Lord Curzon's Government; but ultimately the Shaikh decided to postpone the visit for fear of offending the Turkish Government, though the reason he gave was that his visit might compromise the Government of India. In 1906, on the occasion of the visit of His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan, it was proposed to invite the Shaikh, along with the Shaikhs of Bahrain and the Trucial coast, to India, but Your Lordship's predecessor in Office, in his telegram to the Government of India, dated the 20th November 1906, considered that Shaikh Mubarak's visit was open to political objection. Again in December 1910, the Shaikh formally addressed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf asking for permission to come to India on the occasion of the Delhi Durbar in the following year in order, as he explained, to pay his homage to His Majesty the King-Emperor. The Durbar was, however, intended to be a purely Indian function, and it was therefore decided to instruct the Resident to explain this to the Shaikh and to hold out to him the prospect of an invitation on a later occasion. 3. The Shaikh's present proposal, therefore, deserves favourable considera tion, and there seems no reason to discourage his visit again in so far as India is concerned, provided that in the meantime the Anglo-Turkish Convention has been ratified and that the Shaikh can make adequate provision for the conduct of the administration of his principality during his absence. But, as regards his proposed visit to Cairo and London, we are of opinion that, even if the Shaikh were accompanied on such a tour by a British Political Officer, it would not be possible for him as a Turkish Kaimmakam to refuse an invitation or possibly a summons from the Porte to visit Constantinople. We cannot overlook this contingency, and do not think it is desirable that the Shaikh should either visit Constantinople or have occasion to refuse an invitation. We should, therefore, prefer to discourage this part of his tour.2 4. If Tour Lordship concurs in these views, we will submit specific recommendations as regards the Indian tour and also consult the local officers as to the most convenient means of discouraging the proposed visit to Cairo and London. We shall be glad to receive telegraphic instructions. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Tour Lordship's most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) HARDINGE of PENSHURST. BEAUOHAMP DUEP. R. W.

I am to say that His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, to whom the matter was referred, approves in principle of the proposed visit to India on the understanding that suitable arrangements are made for the administration of the principality during the Shaikh's absence and that all pending agreements relative to Kuwait have been concluded by that time. I am, accordingly, to request that you will, in due course, submit detailed proposals with an estimate of cost, of the tour in India. 3. His Lordship considers it desirable discreetly to discourage the proposed visits to Cairo and London, and I am to reauest that you will favour the Government of India with yourvlews as to the most suitable means of dl'ssuading theShaikh from undertaking them. The dangerous symptom^ which his health developed last year, suggest that medical advice at a timely juncture might perhaps serve the purpose.

He had been suffering from malarial fever for several days but was much better on the 28th morning and transacted indoor business as usual. His condition was maintained throughout the day, but after the evening meal he fell asleep on a couch before retiring for the night and died quite suddenly from heart failure when an attendant awakened him. 3. Shaikh Jabir on being informed of his father 1 s death at ' about 9 p.m., sent over a secretary. Muhammad bin Khamis, to beg in his name for the protection of H.M.'s Government on succeeding to the Shaikhdom as his father^s heir apparent and nominee, and to assure me that his fidelity to us and regard for our wishes would exceed even those of his father. I replied that K.M.'s Government were aware that the late Shaikh had desired that Shaikh Jabir should succeed him, and that he might be assured of their support on the understanding; given, adding that I would refer his request officially to you, As Muhammad bin Khamis appeared to be in a state of somBli trepidation I asked him whether Jabir had any fear of oppo sition to his aucceaslon and he replied in the negative; but, in view of the general opinion in Kuwait that there might be trouble from Sir Mubarak* b second son Salia and hie friends, X thought it beet to include in mj telegram a request for the presence of one of His Majesty 1 ® ship© for a few days until Shaikh Jabir had consolidated his position. Shaikh Bali®, who was out fighting the AJman tribe as already reported, has not yet returned to Kuwait, and meanwhile Jabir, with the help of Sir Ehaaal Khan and myself, has taken up the position of ruler. It is now thought that Salin* will, however unwillingly, recog nise his brother as Shaikh on return, any opportunity he may have had for raising o position having passed, and at the time of writing all la quiet, Balim is expected to arrive in Kuwait any day, and a further report will be submitted in due course. 4.

To Tha Hon'ble Mr• A.H• Grant,C»S.IC.I.H:., Boreign Secretary to the Governm - v &gt;:t of India Foreign and Political Department, DELHI. In continuation of the oorreapondance ending with your telegram No. '565-D. dated 4th December 1915 on the subject of the death of Shaikh Sir Mubarak- u b ~Subah, Ruler of Kuwait,(the Ho.0#59 dated 3rd December 1915.} contents of which were duly conveyed through the Political Agent Cuwalt, to the late Shaikh's family) I have the honour to forward for the information of the Govornment of India a copy of the marginally mentioned letter, which X have received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, reporting the sad occurrence. In th3 first sentence of his letter Lieut -Colonel Grey alludes to a telegram of the 26th of ^ove&gt;' ; ber which he despatched here. This telegram reached here on the 39tb but was unfortuna% tely sent in a Code which has recently been withdrawn from cir culation 'by the Foreign Office, and which under telegraphic orders from Hie ajesty'a Hinleter, Tehran, I had quite recently destroyed. Colonel Grey being out of telegraphic communication had not yet learnt this. In consequence the telegram unfortu nately could not be understood, and the first intimation I received of Shaikh Mubarak*s death was, as mentioned in my tele gram Jo, 1.508 dated 2nd December, by telegram received from the Clerk-in-Charge at Fao on that day. However, although for the above reasons I did not receive Orj, the request for one^/H.IA's Ships, to which Colonel Grey alludes, it seamed to me likely that the presence of a man of war would$ 0.131F. be advantageous, bo (aa already reported in my telegram no .131 c dated Bnd December) I asked the OornM^tm of the Persian Gulf Squadron if one could be spared and he was good enough to despatch 'Bramble 1 * forthwith# She arrived at Kuwait at 2*60 p.m. on the 3rd December having been delayed for some hours by bad weather during the crossing. Shaikh Salim the Snd son of Shaikh lubarak whose attitude was somewhat doubtful returned from hia expedition against the the new state of affairs, the Political Agent, who had interview ed him on the 8th instant, said that the services of H.M.S# 'Bramble' were no longer required, and the ship accordingly left Kuwait on the morning of the ICth December, A copy of Lieut- Commander Blckford^ letter of proceedings to the Commodore is attached for information# 9 December, and as he appeared to acquiesce in I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant.

R.M.S. Bramble arrived on the 3rd, and in the morning of the 4th her Captain and I called on Shaikh Jabir and Sir Khazal Khan. Lt-Commander Bickford offered condolence to the former on behalf of E.H.'b Navy, expressing the hope that the relations which had existed between the late Shaikh and H.M^s ships would continue with him; and received suitable assurances in reply. The visit was returned by Shaikh Jabir on 6th inst # on board H.M.S. Bramble, a salute of twelve guns being accorded to him on leaving the ship. 3. I attach a translation of Shaikh Jabir's reply to the gracious message of sympathy which was transmitted to him by E.E. the Viceroy and the Govt, of India. It v/ill be observed that he reiterates his intention to serve H .M.'s Grovernraent even more faithfully than did his father. 4. Shaikh Salim bin Mubarak who is Jabir 1 s junior by a year or so only, and whose feelings regarding his brother^ succession were uncertain, arrived in Kuwait on the 7th inst, and the same evening had a long conference with his brother and Shaikh Sir iQiazal Khan who has always been friendly with© him. A complete agreement was arrived at, and though the terms have not yet coine to my knowledge, the brothers intend, according to Sir Khazal, to reduce them to writing for my counter-signature. Salim has agreed to recognise his brother as Shaikh and to serve him faithfully as such. Sir Khazal leaves Kuwait tomorrow. 5. On the evening of the 8th inst. Lt-6ommander Biokford and I visited Shaikhs Salim bin Mubarak and Jabir bin Subah, brother of the late Shaikh, We were received with great cordiality by both, and each expressed the hope that the favour of Government would continue to be extended to Kuwait and its people under Shaikh Jabir as it had been under his father. 6. I am grateful to Sir Khazal Khan for loyal assistance in effecting the accession of Shaikh Jabir, and to H.M.S, Bramble for her presence and support at this critical time. Mullah Salih the chief secretary to the late Shaikh who continues to act in that capacity with Shaikh Jabir, is heart and soul with us and has rendered yeoman service. 7. I trust that the steps taken will meet with your approval and with that of the G-ovt, of India. It is necessary in these cases to recognise the successor without delay in order to prevent disturbance, and we now await the favour of a more formal recognition of Shaikh Jabir should that be considered necessary.

The letters contained passages giving the usual Kuwait gossip regarding British re verses in Iraq and a dismal view of our prospects elsewhere, with reference to the death of Shaikh Mubarak and the probabili ty of disturbances in connection with the succession as Shaikh J^bir was our nominee whereas the people preferred Shaikh Salim.) 3, At a personnal interview on the 14th instant, I mentioned the matter to Shaikh Jabir, without however informing him that the man had remarked in his letters upon Sir Mubarak^ death and possible complications, and the Shaikh at once sent for All Muhammad. He arrived after I had left the palace, but it appears that Shaikh Jabir first boxed his ears and then struck him a few blows with a sandal, no stick being handy, saying at the same time that he would not have dnti-Snglish letters written from here and that Ali must leave his territ6ries within five days. 4. dearly the next morning Ali Muhammad came to me begging for intercession and that he might be allowed to remain in Kuwait. 1 told him that I had not revealed to Shaikh Jabir that which would have made matters much more serious for him than they were, and consented to intercede for him after extracting a promise that he would not write again upon the subject of the war without shewing the letter to me. Accordingly I asked Shaikh Jabir to allow Ali Muhammad to remain in Kuwait on the understanding that he would not again offend in this manner, ararid he agreed. 5.

Addressed Basrah repeated Bus-hire Hamilton.6th February 1917„ My dear Sir Peroy, I enolose a memo ot my interview with Mulla Salih whom I sent for on receipt or news of the death of Shaikh Jabir, There was only a very short period of uncertainty as to the succession for Salim promptly tooJa command on his own initiative and ordered business to proceed as usual (i.e. the shops to re tina in open) and fixed the funeral for the following day. He has since conveyed me the fullest assurances as regards his future policy. He volunteered that when notifying SahiKh Jabir's death he will not address Bin i^ashid and he will bring me any communi- -cations he should receive from that quarter or any other party with whom the British Government is not on friendly terms. As far as it is sax'e to prophecy I feel that Salim being a man of character and some constancy will be an improvement upon Jabir. His austerity is not likely to tone down very greatly at his time of life and we must bear in mind the limitations of a straightlaoed Mohammadan with Wahabi leanings in our dealings with him. He says he wants my advice and I have begun by suggesi: -ing that these young Shaikhs of the as Sabah family will be x'ar better employed in the desert looking after the tribes and main— -taining order in the uinterland than in loai'ing about in town with their braves and pimps. jabir was too easy goj-ng and the country close to Kuwait was gradually beaoiaing unsax-e. We want a bold policy. I venture to suggest that two favours may be oonoeded at the beginning ot his regin firstly that othnan al Rashid be delivered to him for punishment ton'ble Lt-Golonel Sir P .Z.Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E | Political Resident in the Persian Gull and Chief Political Officer, Basrah. J5'/ punishment whioh may take the form of a heavy fine. His businesi with India has been stopped by us. I have attached one oonsign- -ment of goods landed eac ,, palamootta M and more stuff is on its way an&amp; the w 2ayani M and will similarly be held up o This stoppage oi business alone will ruin the man as a merchant and will be a suf- -fioient deterrant to the remainder. The other is that the oon- -signment of arms (1000 rifles and ammunition) may be forwarded as soon as possible. It will be a good thing for Salim to start on the organization of the Kuwait forces a® promptly. If he makes an effioient machine I may recommend him later for more assistance. ^^Bramble is in. the Commander, Bickford, and I call upoi X&amp;.E Shaikh Salim at 4 p.m. today. Tomorrow I hold a sort of Durbar at the Agency whioh Shaikh Salim, with Jabir as Sabah, Ahmad al Jabir and other members of the family and his people will be present. The Oommander of the Bramble has also kindly agreed to attend. On taking our seats a signal will be run up and the Bramble will fire a salute. Later in the day Shaikh Salim and I will go aboard the Bramble to return the Commander's visit o I trust that you will approve of these arrangements. Every -thing is satisfactory as far as can be seen. You will no doubt yourself pay us another visit before long.

Mulla Salih proposed to put off conveying this message until after the burial of Shaikh Jabir, but I requested him to lose no time about it in order to damp down excitement and prevent any oon- —tretemps occurring in the night. He agreed.

MBMOHMBUM. Before prooeedin^ on leare I venture to suMit for reoord the following information whi«h,qmlte apart frora the raiding and bioslcade questions, shows how unsatisfactory and unsuitable Shaikh Salia is as a ruler* Firstly. At rarious times I have heard that the Persiam Community in Kuwait are desirous of plaoing them selves under British p^oteetion and on two oeeasions I have been definitely asked if thus eould not be done* On the second oeeasion my questioner,the leading Persian merchant here, said that in the time of Shaikhs Mubarak and Jabir the Persians always got impartial treatment and Justice and that no difference was made between Sunni and Shi 1 ah in that res- peot,while the policy of the present Shaikh was the reverse: he warmly eulogised our protection of Persians in Bahrain and begged that the community here mi^ht be placed on a simil ar footing. I explained to him that the case of Bahrain was different as there wch§d an agreement with the Shaikh as re- gards foreigners and that I could offer him no hope in that direction. He persisted in his request,asking as a concrete case what action,if any,they could hope for from us if one of their number was Imprisoned unjustly or murdered,to which I replied that,while they were,of course,entirely subject to the Ruler of the country in which they saw fit to reside,the \ Political A^ent w&amp;uld no doubt be able to afford them his ^ood offices in case of any serious miscarriage of Justice or out rage. Secondly. There seems to be widespread dissatisfaction with Shaikh Salinas methods of Oovernment. I attach a note by Lieu^ Me CoHum on he opinions advanced by a leading Arab merchant of Kuwait in p recent conversation: while these opinions are!&gt;/ rather grandiose and partly the outeome of a personal @ grieYan«e,they appear to reflect in the xaain what is pass ing in the minds of the townspeople. There are two ^reat the eamses of/lTssatisfaction in the town. The one,the attitude taken mp 'by the Shaikh in the matter of the issue of per mits for the export of ^oods from India to Kuwait:the mer chants, although thinking the conditions somewhat hard,wish to tarry on with trade while Shaith Salim represents them to us as stating that they want free trade or no trade,partly to make things difficult for us and partly to get all the profit into his own hands. The other,his eulpablem^jcHdt neglect in investigating and punishing crime,eren murder, the futility of his general methods of Gorernment and his boorish manners towards his people. Thirdly. As far as we are concerned Shaikh Salim does not appear to be a suitable Ruler for Kuwait# He entirely xacks every attribute of a ruler,except great knowledge of the bedouin,which he uses to our detriment,is unstable and ignor ant of any view or mode of life beyond that of the bedouin with whom he lived for so long. He hates us and is only driven into a display of friendship by force;he may bow to the 1 : tter but I am convinced that he will never give us loyal co-operation - that is,as an instrument in our prefsent or future relations with Arabia he Is and will rem In use less. If not aetlyely worlclng against us. In any ease Shaikh Sallm Is not young and Is hated,so that,whether we are forced to depose him ourselres or not. It hehorea ua to think; over the question of a aueeessor. y tenure of this appointment has been short and at a time when It has been almost Imposslhle to fcsms get to know any thing of the reigning family,but when the question of the sueeesslon Is considered I would call attention to Suhah bin Naslr ( aged about[S years)of whom I hear Shaikh Mubar ak thought very highly Indeed jin fact he watehed his train ing himself and projected to send hi to sehool at Basrah.On Shaikh Sal la coming into power he sent Smbah into the desert to make hira a 'bedouin like himself. I understand that the boj was of goo4 physique and of a very promising char*- aetenit is possible that with a British controlled edu®a~ tion he mi^ht solve the problem of providing a worthy successor to Shaildi Mmbarak. I should like to add that I make the above report with great regret as personally I like Shaikh Salin despite his £ faults. wmjgf I X » A# p Political Agent,Kuwait Copy to Deputy Political Resident Bu shire, Mr.Philby.SECRET » The following Is the smbstanse of what X told me on x 3-.9-1918:- The people of Koweit are qmite tired of Salim and hi© wajs and for some weelcs nast hare 'been disems»ing the pro bability of his deposition which they think we are certain to bring abomt on account of his insincerity and steadfast opposition to our policy. The vast majority of the people would welcome such a step as he has ©eased to be of any further use to them and is a hindrance to their business. His oolicy with us (which they condemn)has resulted in the establishment of a blockade with very limited trading facilities. He refuses to help them,misrepresents their case to us and orevents them from availing of such trading facilities' as are offered to them by us. They realise the importance of having a ruler who is friendly to us and they have lost all faith in Salim. n x ^ 1 Abd Allah (Salim 1 s son)is looked upon as likely to be no better than his father ;Ahmet ibn Jabber they consider not much better;Jabber(Mubarak's brother)they consider would Ive most satisfaction but think a British minister to watch over him and a maglis appointed or approved by us to guide him would be essential. The su,^ ested co.ipcsition of the aa- lis is:4 Kowelties,d PersiansTShiahs),1 Jew and 1 or 3 representatives of other sections of tie community. The people want a Government modelled on our own.and especially so with regard to the administration of justice. Foreigners complain bitterly of the unfair treatment they are receiving an the Persians are considering the submission of a petition to the P.A.to take them under his protection as is done in Bahrein. The people dislike Salim personally.

This they say is not 'one in any ouhor Gulf Salim'is on bad terms ^ith Bin Sa'adtSheikh K&amp;a'sal, Sheikh Ibrahim of Zubeir,etc.,etc. The non-arrival of NeJd caravans in Koweit during the past few months is attributed to Salim's doings. ^ , .. . The letter written by Salim to the P.A.in ;hich was stated that the merchants would only be satisfied with free trade as formerly is a misreprentation of the twte facts which are as follows:- Salim tild Hillal(a well . + anti-British merchantHo call the leading merchants to^^ther and tell them they should say in Salim s ma^l.c s that they would only be cont nt with free trade. Subsequently when in Salim's maglis many of the merchants stated the terms under which oasses were to be issued were certainly severe but nevertheless they were prepared to abide oy them. Sifclim was very angry,wrote to the P.A.saying that the mrchants did not azree with the conditions for trading and otherwise misrepresented the actual facts. Later rhen son. of ^e merchants approached him with a view to obtaining passes e refused to have anything to do with them saying ^kat would be responsible for the ^oodc once they arrived^in Koweit but that it was not his business to help the merchant® to brin^ goodssi to the place.

As I reported at time Abdullah had hopes of .succeeding his father. Since Ahmed's return and recognition as Sheikh he has been^assisting*' and got good deal of power into his own hands, which Ahmed with hit easy going nature allowed. He appears to have been trying to N order in his ot^n name instead of his. Recently he drafted a scale of salaries for family including Ahmed, in which he allotted himself nearly as much as Ahmed and far more than Hamad or any of the others. Ahmed is said to have agreed as line of least resistance, but I am not sure of this. AnyhcvV there was stormy scene between Abdullah and rest of family at which Jabir as Subah did some very plain speaking, formal as is his custom, and sinc-e then Abdullah has not appeared in public at all. « Political.I , Y , / , No. E.A. fl /&lt;r£-£ II \K 0«i A57](JN. 21. * From AC^. - 7^ ^ , ^ N G -I The Deputy Secretary to the Govern^renVof' India ^ ntSiOfvcr. | in the Foreign and Political Department, : !

Rv air mall . 2-9tih January 1935. My dear Fowle, Plrle Gordon of 'Hie Times' sent us for revision a few days ago the Arabian section of the Statesman's Year Book.. The paragraph which relates to Koweit remarks 'Although His Highness its two sons by his first marriage, Abdullah (born 1905) and Mohairmed (born 1909) and one by his present consort, the daughter of the late Sheikh Salim ibn Mubarak jabir, (bom June 29th, 1926), the Heir Presumptive according to the Koweiti rule of succession is the Sheikh's uncle, Hamad ibn Mubarak (born 1894), who has a son Mubarak'. 2. Hi is information about the succession in Koweit was new to me. I asked Pirie Gordon what his authority for it was. He replied that 'so far as I remember it was Colonel More who gave me the Koweiti rule of succession', and on my remarking in reply that I had not heard of it before, but that Colonel More was, of Lt.Col. T.C.W. Powle, C.B.E., -Bushire, course/course, an authority who had the advantage of local knowledge, he has written to say;'The Koweiti rule of succession is Turkish, as the Egyptian used to be and the Tunisian still is, because in the first instaace all three dynasties owed their thrones to Ottoman firnans, although they are of Arab, Albanian, and Turco-Cretan origin respectively. You will remanber how much Ismail had to pay in Egypt to get the Porte to change the succession to primogeniture from the Turkish rule that the eldest agnate should succeed - a rule Invented to ensure that a grown man should always be at the head of a nomadic tribes later, when imperial princes ceased to fight, it often meant that a senile dotard succeeded to the throne, of an empire which had become sedentary in its decay*.

( J ' J I have often had informal talks with the Shaikh about the question of Heir Presumptive in general, and to refresh my memory I again had a tf chat8 with him on receipt of the enclosure referred to above* 3, The Shaikh, as he has often told me before, again repeated that in purely Arab States (he excluded of course States like Iraq which are run on British-cum-Turkish rather than Arab lines) it was against all custom and was even con sidered unlucky for Reigning Sovereigns to try and appoint an Heir Apparent, or attempt to get his subjects to swear any sort of oath of fealty to such selected person, during Ruler 1 s his (the lifetime* 4* The Arab idea, said the Shaikh, was that n the best man' should win, after the death of the Ruler. Such '♦best man', would always appear, and would at once seize the reins of power, either peacefully, by the unfiaimous acclamation of the populace, or by means of a coup d , etat - necessitating possibly but not probably some bloodshed* 5. In small but stable mercantile States like Kuwait, where the Ruler was an autocrat, and the idea of loyalty to the person of the Ruler was stroi]gly ingrained among the various members of the ruling family, and merchant princes, the death of the Ruler would not mean probably more than a peaceful acclamation est by the people of their Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.G.Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE* U*' tJ9./ ItV their new selected Shaiklu In larger and less civilized States like Saudiyeh, there will almost invariably he a proper 'bust up tf on the death of the sovereign, until such time as the next ^strong man' appears and 'makes goody In other words revolution and chaos will be the order for a time. 6. To use the words of the Shaikhr n l have 2 tough and grown up sons now, and a third coming on, but I trust none of them will become Shaikh after me, unless he be worthy and can play the man - I want no tt craven ?f or 'weakling' to succeed me, and bring reproach on the name of Ahmad his Father'. 7. As regards Shaikh Hamad al Mubarak (Shaikh's uncle) being the rightful heir: The Shaikh not only said that he. Shaikh Hamad, had no particular right over others, to the throne after him, but stoutly denied that'the Kuwaiti rule of succession was in any way Turkish or had ever depended on Ottoman Firmans'. 8. In conclusion the Shaikh, as he has often done be^ fore, sharply criticized the attempt of Bin Saud to select a successor in the Amir 'Saud' and to get his tribal leaders to swear fealty by annual oath. The attempt was foolish, he said, and was made purely to 'gull' European diplomats at his Court into thinking the Kingdom of Saudiyeh was now run on modern lines, and could be compared with European States. This was not the case, continued the Shaikh, and no one knew this better than Bin Saud himself, who in private talks with members of his family, was never tired of saying, 'As long as I am your Ruler I intend to rule, so beware, but when I am dead let the best man among you win in the chaos that must follow'.5 - 9* In this connection one must not forget that the King's brother, Mohamed, a dour and doughty warrior who helped Bin Saud win his throne and went through all the ups and downs of his early life, has for the last 2 years openly refused to swear fealty to Amir Saud* See my last Intelligence Sumnary but one*CONFIDENTIAL.
