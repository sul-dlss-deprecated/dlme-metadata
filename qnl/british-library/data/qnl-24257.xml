News immediately reached the people of Dibai who set out after them on camels towards the desert road. The kidnappers, on knowing that the people of Dibai were coming after them, they left the two boys and came walking to Dibai from the sea-shore side. At Dibai, they put up as guests with a man named Salim bin Musabbih of Dibai. Those who went after the bedouins soon after heard the news and returned to Dibai. They caught hold of the bedouins in the house of Salim and surrendered them to the ''Ailer of Dibai who kept them in jail for two days and then released them. 2. On 30th, three of the ’Awamir put up as guests with the ■^ler of Sharjah. After two days, they left and, on their way, they kidnapped a small water-carrier boy who was drawing water at the wells.

On the other hand, unless we have some reason for Believing that the Shaikhs themselves are in league with the kid nappers, which is not thought to Be the case, as local public opinion amongst the subjects of any Shaikh would hardly tolerate their friends and relations Being kid napped with the connivance of the Shaikh, the Shaikhs are not actually Breaking their treaties, But merely £ 4 -Hesident in e Persian Gulf.

After that he infonaea me that all the persons v«ho were kidnappea from Snarjah have Been restored. As the reports bore no distinctive details ol the persons kidnapped, I han to start enquiries atresh for their descriptions. I repeated my demand for the restoration of the persons kidnapped from the kidnappers in a manner you/ have ordered. On receipt of your last letter I again persisted in my demand for a definite reply and his reply was that (A) Out of the five persons, servant of Ifuhammad bin Damesh has been recovered and he is in Sharjah at present. One was irom Batina but U) /Vt Co rv/'j ‘ he does not know who kidnapped him. Inspite of enquiries made for him nothing could be ascertained as he used to cut grass at three days distance from Sharjah. *.s regards the third hi, was taken from the boundary of Bubai.

Shaikh Rashid helped the men of Shaikh Sultan who were sent to recover the boys. They were living in the village Khan ana ait-er and after being restored, they went to their native place Iran. 3.

On receipt of your letter No.211-a/ 11 dated the 24th May 1936, I consulted with the Ruler of Sharjah regarding restoration of kidnapped persons. He did not admit that the five persons mentioned in your letter .rare kidnapped from Sharjah. After that he iniormec me that all the persons who were kidnapped from Sharjah have been restored. As the reports bore no distinctive details oi the persons kidnapped, I had to start enquiries airesh for their descriptions. I repeated ray demand for the restoration of the persons kidnapped frora the kidnappers in a manner you/ have ordered. On receipt of your last letter I again persisted in my demand for a definite reply and his reply was that (A) Out of the five persons, servant of Muhammad bin Darwesh has been recovered and he is in Sharjah at present. One was from Batina but he does not know who kidnapped him. Inspite of enquiries made for him nothing could be ascertained as he used to cut grass at three days distance frora Charjah. As regards the third he was taken from the boundary of Rubai. He does not know any tiling about the remaining two. (B) As regards the slave woman mentioned in your letter No.211-A/ll , it will appear from * para 97 of report No.10 for the last half aonth of May 1935 that she has been duly restored. In this connection a copy of Reference your letter No.3o4-B/ll dated the 6th August 1936. letter/, (C) O* /sin // latter aduressded to the Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Eushire, was sent to you under No.193 dated the 6th July 1935* If she is not the same woman, I request that I may be furnished with details about her# Regarding the boy of Khan, the Shaikh says that in fact there were two boys. They have been restored last year. In support d. his words he says that Shaikh Rashid bin IP^ad, Head of Al Bu Shames is aware of this. Shaikh Rashid helped the men of Shaikh Sultan who were sent to recover the boys. They were living in the village Khan and af-ter and after being restored, they went to their native place Iran. 3. On the 29th June 1936, when Mr. Howes, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, visited Sharjah, I explained to him matters regarding kidnapping. I tola him that the Ruler of Sharjah is the weakest Ruler in the Trucial Coast /W' , , , , , a ml* he cannot recover persons kidnapped. He has no such power that can make the marauders fear him and aeter them from committing crimes in the area of iiis Shaikhdom. In support of what I say, I beg to invite your attention to •the letter No.370 dated the 13th August 1934 addressed by late Khan Bahadur ? Isa bin Abaul Latif to the Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Eushire, copy of which is enclosed for your infor mation. You are aware that the kidnappers are outsiders on whom the Shaikh has no control. Restoration of all those in the past was due to his friend Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad, Head of Al Bu Shames, living in Al Braimi. The Chiefs of the Trucial Coast are the persons who encourage the bedouin kidnappers in their perpetration. If all of them do not come to an agreement to anve/N away tue Kiu&amp;appers aad reiuse to give tiienn slielter or help in any shape, kidnapping will continue as long as the weak Chiefs will exist.

I beg to state that those who kidnap people are from Awamer and Manasir tribes. Their details are not known. They neither obey nor have any connection with any of the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast. When they take away any person and the people of Shaikh follow them and find them in the land, the kidnapped person is recovered by paying some money to them. They return to the country of those bedouins. They live in the desert 4wa?ds by the side of Rub Al Khali. The Shaikhs of tiE Trucial Coast have no control over those bedouins.

T A No.316-j3/ll, oatea 19th October 1938. 2. When Saqr bin Sultan, Shaikh of huraimi, declared war against the Al Bu Shamis, the Shaikh of Ajman hurried for his succour, and consequently became at war with the Al Bu Shamis, on Saqr bin Sultan T s side. The lives and property of the subjects of each of the belligerent parties were therefore subject to agression and raiding by the otner. Accordingly, the Khawatir who accompanied Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid to -^uraimi, raided four camels of the Al ^u Shamis and drove them as war spoils. On the other hand one Mani’ of the Nomad Al Bu Shamis, with three otners, raided Ajman but was not successful save for the slave whom ne captured between Hira and Ajman. The nuler of ^narjah had then been about two days in ^uraimi and his brotner Muharamau was acting in his place. As regards the reason of the cnarge, Muhammad bin daqr was a sincere friend of the Al Bu Snamis and the abovementioneu Mani f called at Sharjah before proceeding to Hira from where he raided and captured the slave. Hence the charge against Sharjah, which the Ruler entirely repudiates. What is quite certain is that the Ruler of Sharjah differed with the ^uler of Ajman when both were at Buraimi, and the relations between them became very tense on account of the slave in question, wnom the Ruler of iijraan alleged to have been kidnapped near Hira in Sharjah territory. The Ruler of ^narjah, however, repudiated Ajman ! s allegation and said that the slave was kidnapped in Ajman territory. 3. The Ruler of Sharjah, however seized this oppor tunity to turn the event to account. Re secretly intimated to one ^hrnad bin Lutah of Ajrnan, whom he uses as a spy and( 2 ^ /; - 2 - prpagandist for him at Ajman, to propose to the Ruler ol Ajman to request Shaikh Sultan (Sharjah) to use his iniluence with the Al ^u Shamis, with whom he had entered into ”ahd al asabah' at Buraimi, witii a view to recovering the slave. The Ruler of Sharjah’s object was to do a favour to tne Ruler of iijraan and thus make him always acquiesce to his wishes and support him in his difficulties. Ahmad bin Lutah actually recommended this course of action to the Ruler of ^jman who deputed him to tne Ruler of Sharjan. The latter complied with the Ruler of Ajman T s request, but asked him to return the four camels captured by tne Khawatir, which he aid. As the Al Bu Shamis would not be affected by a mere request from the Ruler of Sharjah, he, to maintain his prestige and keep his promise, had to pay ks.400/- in cash and rice to Ahamad bin Sarur ash Shamsi, because when Mani T raided Ajman he borrowed his riding camel from the said Ahmad bin Sarur of Hamasa. This camel died of fatigue, and Mani f had to give the slave to Ahmad to sell her and take as value of nis camel whatever he could obtain over Rs.300/- Shaikh Sultan has thus made a favour to tne Al Bu Shamis by returning tne four camels captured from them, and another favour to tne Ruler of Ajman by restoring the slave/ to him on payment of her value from his own pocket, as without doing so he could not have recovered the slave. 4. According to local usage in Oman it is not permissible to commit an agression against tne lives and properties of the subjects of a 'Mu T anid' (i.e. one with whom an alliance or ”ahd' has been concluded) except in a state of war. Should anyone commit an act of agression by kidnapping any souls or capturing the property of a friend who is in 'ahd' relations, and realizes the fact either afiax at the time of commitment or afterwaras, it would be incumbent on him to restore tne same at once. Therefore, the return by the Al Bu Shamis of a slave who belongeu to Sharjan, when they realizea tnis fact, is but duty according to the tribal usage observea in these territories.

I beg to state that on the evening of 6th June 1939 Mih&amp;mad bin Babib informed Shaikh ^aid bin Haktum that his brother Reza Lari has sold ^aryam bint ^abrook who was serving him in his house.' Maryam is the daughter of ^abrook, slave of the sons of Habib, who was manumitted and died 7 years ago. Mabrook left Maryam who remained with her mother Fatimah who is a free born person and not a slave of anyone. The Ruler of ^ebai sent a man at once to arrest Reza but the latter managed to ran away from the Shaikh* s men. The Sheikh on hearing that xv eza had ran away sent his men inside and outside the town in search of Xi eza and in the morning of the 7th June the Shaikh’s men succeeded in arresting ^eza who had concealed himself behind some rocks in the Seaplane B ase at sea. Beza was taken to the Shaikh but he denied having sold Maryam and stated that he did not know anything about the matter. The Sheikh issued orders for flogging Reza publicly and after beating him severely and he was about to die he admitted that he had sold Maryam r } through one Abdul Karim of Anazah tribe to a certain Sa'ad bin Atoad al Sharif of Kejdwho has been residing at ^ebai for years. ! ihe Shaikh issued instructions for arresting and keeping both the individuals in prison. when 2. Reza declared that 10 days ago/he met Abdul Karim he questioned him for 2 or 3 days about the slaves and the latter xxk told him that he knew nothing about them. At last Reza told Abdul Ix arim that he had a young slave for sale. Abdul K ar i m took him to °a , ad bin Ahmad al ^harif who agreed to purchase liaryam for i*s.400/- on condition that d eza should get her outside the town and hand her over to one of the ^edouins. The price would be paid to Wza after having done so. On the 4th June Reza told Maryam to go to the date gardens outside the town and bring unripe dates for him as usual. A Bedouin was waiting for her outside the town. Abdul Karim to whom the girl was shown on the way without her knowledge was also there. After handing over the2 . 7^? girl to the -^edouin Reza and Abdul Rarim went to Sa f ad al Shari f who oaid the money to u eza Habib out of which Abdul ^arim took Rs.100/-.

Abdul K-arim bin i'4ihajnad was at ^harjah but came on 20th ^ay 1939 to ~ebai in search of a Rakhnda in order to go to diving with him. It happened that while he was standing at the motor stand at ^ebai he saw Sa ! ad al Sharif waiting for a car to go to ^ • • ... , Ajman. After a short while Abdul Karim met ^eza bin -^abib near the coffee-shop and the latter asked him as to whether he knew anyone who wanted to purchase a slave. Abdul ^arim told him that he was a stranger but he would search flor some one. He went at once to the coffee-shop and^ooke to ^a’ad al Sharif who told him that he would not purchase anyone in the town but he would do so outside the town or at Rraimi. Sa f ad further stated that the seller should be held responsible if the girl is discovered to be a free bom person. Abdul Aarim informed Resa of what Sa’ad had said and after some negotiations it was agreed that the sale price should be Rs.400/-. On the 4th June Reza took her outside the town on the pretext of collecting unripe dates for himKjfcA, and there a Redouin was concealing himself among .the trees, fhe ^edouin took delivery of her and put her on his camel after handing over to x *eza a paper written by Sa’ad. On Reza^ return Sa*adpaid him Rs.400/- and the former paid R s.20/- to Abdul Karim and not Rs.100/- as alleged by him.
