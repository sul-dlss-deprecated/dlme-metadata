Grby , I.A., Officiating Political Agent, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. I have the honour to forward a copy of Foreign Department letter No. 452-E.B., dated 1st February 1905, regarding jurisdiction at Maskat over the subjects of Christian Powers laving no Consular representation in the Sultan's territory, and to add the following remarks with reference thereto. 2. On page 11 of the draft Maskat case for the Hague Arbitration, of which you have received a copy under this office endorsement ^io. 7 of 28th January, it is stated, with myself as authority, that there have been up to the present very few French citizens in Maskat, and that at the time when the case for arbitration arose there was in Oman only one French citizen (Goguyer) outside the Consular Fstablishment and 'one citizen of a Christian btate not having a Consul at Maskat who was treated as being under the French Consul.' The person referred to was the late Monsieur Bevidion, the Russian Armenian, and representative of the Odessa firm of Kever K.otf &amp; Co. 3. As far as I remember this individual, when he first came to open a branch in Maskat, brought credentials to the French Consulate and looked to that Consulate for protection in bis business affairs. His title to protection by the French Consul, if he so desired, was not I think ever questioned by the Sultan ; and while I was in Maskat never came into prominent issue. hen Bevidion was drowned last summer in Maskat harbour, I think I remember being informed that his effects were taken posses sion of and his estate wound up by the French Consul. In this the bultan must, no doubt, have acquiesced. 4. I would turn now to the clause on page 24 of the draft Maskat case wherein it is stated, though in brackets as if its inclusion was doubtlul, that 44 the Sultan of Maskat has always been prepared to accept French jurisdic tion as attaching to subjects of a Christian Power not having a Consul at Maskat, who have registered themselves at the French Consulate there. The words 'has always been' seems little sweeping trom the fact that cases in point have been so extremely rare. In my own experience I can only remember one other instance besides the case of Bevidion, of a foreign subject taking advantage of the good offices or protection of the French Consulate, namely, that of Count (or Major) Leontieff and a companion who paid a visit to Maskat about three years ago, and, if I remember right, approached the bultan always through the French Consul. 5. With regard to the concluding paragraph of the Foreign Department letter under reference, I have no knowledge of the Sultan ever having actively indicated his preparedness in the direction suggested.I tnlcp it, bowerer, that unless h e speoial reasons for object in? an'l resistino- in a particular case, he Would tacitly accept without question the protection or, at all events, the go 0( i offices of any of the Foreign Consul at Maskat in favour of the subject of a Christian power not Consularly represented. 6. The foregoing observations have been set down from memory, and can only be checked from the Maskat records. I have the honour to request that you will do this, and that after adding anv further information which you may be in possession of, you will submit the result, together with your own views, direct to Government, sending a copy to me. As you will probably be absent for some time after this letter reaches Haskat, I am sending a copy of it to the Foreign Department as anaci interim reply to their reference. U. I. C. P.

Section 1. No. 1. The Marquess or Lansdowne to Mr. Choate. Eoreign Office, 20tli December 1904. Sir, I have the honour to inclos? a copy of an agreement which has been come to between His Majesty's Government and that of the French Eepublio for referring to arbitration certain matters in dispute between them in regard to Muscat,* which are specified in the Preamble to the agreement. Your Excellency will observe that, under the terms of the agreement (Article 1), each of the High Contracting Parties is to nominate one Arbitra tor, who shall not be a subject or citizen of either power, and shall be chosen from among the Members of the Hague Tribunal. The Government of the French Republic have nominated as their Arbitrator M. de Jonkheer de Savourin Lohman, Member of the Second Chamber of the States-General of the Netherlands. His Majesty's Government are desirous, if possible, to be represented by a citizen of the United States, and are advised that the post of Arbitrator would be most suitably filled by Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States' Superme Court. I should accordingly be greatly obliged if your Excellency would ascer tain whether the United States' Government will agree to this selection, and if so, whether Mr. Fuller will be good enough to accept the office of Arbitrator. As it is necessary that His Majesty's Government should make known to the Government of the French Republic, as soon as possible, the name of the Arbitrator selected by them, I should be grateful if your Excellency could favour me with a reply at the earliest possible date.

I TOLD the French Ambassador to-day that the American Government had placed ui our disposal the services of Chief Justice Fuller to act as Arbitrator in the Muscat Case, but that he could not at present be certain whether his public engagements in the United States would allow of his presence at The Hague within the strict time fixed by the agreement between the two Governments for the meeting of the Tribunal— viz., the 27th May. Mr. Fuller suggested that perhaps the time limit of one fortnight, within which the Tribunal are to assemble after the delivery of the Arguments, might be extended to one month, in which case he could count upon reaching The Hague without undue haste. I asked his Excellency to be good enough to ascertain whether the French Government had any objection to this proposal. It would not of course involve any delay in the exchange of Cases, Counter-Cases, and Arguments, the delivery of which would still be governed by the terms of the Agreement of the 13th October.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's note of the nth instant relative to the Muscat Arbitration. His Majesty's GoTernment have great pleasure in agreeing to M. Delcasse s sug gestion that the fortnight's delay in the assembling of the Tribunal, which will be necessary in order that Chief Justice Fuller may reach The Hague without undue haste, should be provided by postponing the date for the delivery of the Cases until the 1st February. As regards the choice of an Umpire, it would seem to be sufficient that the two Governments should request the Arbitrators selected by them to concert with each other on the subject, and, if the Government of the French Eepublic see no objection, His Majesty's Government will ask the Chief Justice of the United States to com municate accordingly with M. Savornin Lohman. His Majesty's Government are inclined to think that formal record of the postponement agreed upon would be most conveniently made by means of an exchange of notes, and I should be obliged if your Excellency would be good enough to ascertain whether this course is approved by the Government of the French Uepublic.

Muscat, 27th February 1905 Sir, i have the honour to address you in reference to }rot.ection afforded by the French Vice Consul in Muscat to the subjects of Christian Powers unrepresented locally by Consular Officers, and in so doing would invite a reference to letter No. 22 dated 19th February 1905 from the Political Resident in t.he Persian Gulf to my address, a copy of which he has forwarded to you. *' case of Mr. Bedevian (not Bevidion) t.o which Major wO^. reters is explained i think by the fact that, he was a Russian subject and the representative of a Russian firm, and as such, rightly or wrongly, looked for protection to the Consul oi the allied Power in the absence of a representative of his own Government. On Bedevian^s decease his affairs were wound u] by t.he ^renoh vice Consul, and this course was accepted by the sultan, who doubtless saw no reason to interfere so long as the debts of the deceased were duly paid. Bedevian's successor avails himself of the assistance of the French Consulate when necessary. The case of this Russian firm is the only one in whichwhich subj^ct.s of Christian Powers resident, in Muscat#, ot,her than Frenchmen, have oeen protected by the French Vice Consulate. 5.- In regard to visitors, I find that the following Huropeans, in addition to a few Frenchmen, have visited Muscat since the appointment of a French Vice Consul : — (1). In September 1898 a Russian, name unknown supposed to have been a spy. There is no record of his having visited either the Sultan or the French Consulate. (2). A German Mahommedan named Troeppen in March 1899, who does not appear to have employed the good offices of either of the European Consular Officers. (?*). Leontieff and his companion in March 1901. They were Russians who visited lis iighness occasion ally, and according to Major Cox were afforded good offices by the French Vice Consul. ^4^. A Russian named cSagolochuski in July 19C2. ie stayed at the French Consulate for a week. (5). A German, ierr Burchardt, in March 1904 stayed for ten days at this Consulate. le did not visit the Sultan. It would aipear then to be only in the case of Russians that any attempt has been made by the French Vice Consul to protect or assist subjects of Christian Powers unrepresented at Muscat. The Sultan has never, so far as I know, indicated his prepared ness to accept French jurisdiction over such subjects, and though I have never conversed with him on the point I am nearly certain that he regards the protection of the Kevorkoff firm oy the French Vice Consulate with complacency on account of the Franco-Russian alliance. 4^ _ As the connection of France with Russia cannot contrioute00017 con'Dribut.e '50 her } opularity among Mahomedans of t,he Sunni persuasion, I am of opinion -Dhat, no harm would t&gt;e done by allow ing 'Dhe represent.at.ion of Russian interests in Muscat Dy 'Dhe French Vice Consul to rentain uncontrest.ed; but on 'Dhe ot,her hand it. would be prejudicial to our interests t^o allow him to pose as the champion of all Christian nations other than the English. This he has made no attempt to do up to the present time. 5.- A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have etc., (Signed). W.G.GREY.

This so -oalled ' Khoja Port ' dates from the times when there was no seonrity in Matra from Bedouin attacks and when it was consequently necessary for any alien person or collection of persons to take adequate measures for the protection of themselves and their property • The religion and customs of the community differ widely from those of the Beazi Omanis among whom they live • Much of their ritmal , their code of laws especially in connection with s-acoeBsion and landed property are peculiar to themsalve a 'd do not submit in such matters to the Mullahs of Oman but have their own distinct representatives . Both in Tnd3.a and elsewhere however the sect has tM/d-been much disintegrated by variuus internal schisms , and in ImdaNo •1931 E.dated ^ 26th July 1884 • so much so that in 1878 a Coniraission was appotnted for the purpose of Investigating w the customs and views of both divisions of the Khoja sect in the Presidency of Bombay and elsewhere and this resulted In 1384 In a Draft Bill being framed of which a copy was sent to the Political Agert at Muscat with the request that he would obtain the opinion Poreig ^Dept Letter^ of the Khoja community in Muscat on the proposed Bill • • The whole com- -nity was doubtless here referred to whether of Muscat or British nationality and I merely mention the correspondence here to demonstrate how distinct a com- -munity the khojas of Muscat are from the rest of the popui^- -tion , and how closely their affairs are bound up with those of their coreligionists in India • In consideration of the above facts it seems only natural and logical that we should have arranged with the Rulers of Oman that that section of the community which had i -rav- -ed to Muscat after the Annexation of Sind in 1843 should be considered as under the protection of the British Govern- -ment • It is important to note here that at other ports in these waters whether it be Persia or the Pirate Coast a Knoja is as a matter of course regarded as a British STuject , that is to say there is no question of the date of his arrival , the mere fact that he is of the Khoja sect is taken as suf- -ficient evidence of his British nationality just as much as if he were a Hindoo Banian. in brief therefore it will be seen that we only claim as British subjects those who came to Oman after the an x4 -ation of Sind and M/MXt/Mthe copies of past correspon- -dence which I attach will demonstrate how strictly we have adhered to that position • I will now proceed to deal seriatim with the several state ments on the subject of Khojas which we find at the end of Part IV of the French Case • (a) THE CAE OP PADL BIN MIHRAM(0R MEERAN) ,rodl (a) THE CASE OF FADL BIN MIHRAM (OR MEERAN ) • The Muacat records at present available do not go baok beyond 1860 and I cannot tr ace the original record of the case , but copies of letters which passed on the sub- -ject have been found in another coreespondence and they bear dat^Shawal 1274 //rtMrt/yVW/dt/M/MMM/jm/dlM.

Freshi inquiriesk have been made since my arrival here a few days ago with the following result • There are stated to be 1050 souls altogether in the Kbja quarter , of these 25o are adult males and the remainder wo- -men and children . 0 f the 250 males only 120 ( approximat A. -ly ) are entitled to British protection together with their families # The remainder ( 130 males with their families ) are subjects of the Sultan • It will be sen therefore that m^ previous estimate was approximately correct but 11 anytir somewhat over the mark •* Ofjf Cj&gt; ^ y 00043 ( ) In Gwadnr the position of the Khojas is on a different basis from that of Muscat , Gwadnr it must be remembered htfB only been an appanage of the Muscat Sultanate for a little more than 100 years , the port having been presented to the present Sultan's forbear , Seyyid Sultan bin Ahmed , by the Khan of Khelat « All the Khojas there are comparatlvly recent arrivals , offshoots as a rule from Karachi and Sind families with whom they live in close and constant social and commer- Wu'-.-A ' . - cial intercourse . , j . v I have ascertained thet there are 309 souls belonging A -UV At. 8 -'AflT r to this sect now in Gwadur , who without exception claim Bit British nationality • Besides these there would be a few Mus- -cat Khojas , subjects of the Sultan , who have for the time migrated to Gwadur for purposes of trade • ( ) With reference to the case of ,f Abdel Hussein ben Fadl' I have recorded a separate memorandum which I trust will be found to give a satisfactory explanation of it • I beg to revert for a moment in conclusion to the gener question of the protection of Khojas in Muscat • While objec -ting on principle , as long as they are treated as our sub jects , to Individual members of the sect doffing or donning their British nationality for purposes of temporary conven- -lence or evasion of commercial obligation , I do not re- -gard the community as by any means a valuable asset to us as subjects of the British Government • At the same time it would X think be hardly conducive to their interests or to our prestige , for us suddenly to withdraw protection from them « - r In fact when we see around.ua representatives of for- •elgn powers leaving no stone unturned to create Interests by the manufacture of proteges , we can ourselves hardly af- -ford to throw away our own without yery strong grounds • Among the enclosures to this note I have included a copy of the first notification on record issued by Oolonel Ross 9 war -ning British subjects to register themselves • It haJ form- the basis of all subsequent notifications in tiiis connection#Memorandum regarding the case of Abdul Hussein bin Fadl mentioned on page 19 of French Statement 00944 Among the trading firms of Muscat and Matra Is the British protected Khoja: firm of 11 Fadl All Tooranl &amp; Co ' , trading wlh Bombay and Calcutta • Owing to the fact that Its founder,Fadl All^mlgrated from In- -dla after the British Annexation of Slnd and also that the tra- - ding operations of the firm are carried on with India , both the family and the firm have always enjoyed British prot^- -tlon .

KEFEREJNG to your Lordship's note of the 20th December, asking me to ascertain whether my Government would agree to the selection of Mr. Chief Justice Fuller to act as Arbitrator named by His Majesty under the Agreement between His Majesty's Government and that of the French P^epublic for referring to arbitration certain matters in dispute between them in regard to Muscat which are specified in the Preamble to the Agreement, I have the honour to report that the Chief Justice consents, with my Government's approval, to serve as one of the Arbitrators under the said Treaty between Great Britain and France of the 13th October, 1903. I am instructed to say that he greatly appreciates the honour, but hopes that it may be arranged in advance that the meeting of the Tribunal shall not take place earlier than one month after the delivery of the Arguments. The time specified in the Agreement is within a fortnight, and I suppose that the Chief Justice's request is made with a view to his peremptory engagements in the Supreme Court, which usually continue till the middle of May. Six months for the delivery of the Cases and Counter- Cases would bring it to the 13th April, one month more for delivery of Arguments, to the 13th May, and it might not be convenient for him, without undue'haste, to reach The Hague by the 27th May. I should have advised your Lordship of the Chief Justice's acceptance in my private note of the 26th December, but for a blunder in the transmission to me of the cable from Washington announcing it.

In reply I am to enclose a copy of a telegram which Mr. Brodrick has addressed to the Government of India on the subject. On receipt of their reply a further communication will 'be made to you. In the meantime I am to request that you will draw lord Lansdowne r s attention (with reference to the penultimate paragraph of the letter under reply) (1) to the letter from the Sultan of Muscat of the 28th may 1897, in which His Highness asked for the help of the British Government in put- ting an end to the difficulty with the French Government in regard to the grant of French flags to his subjects, and (2) to the letter from Uajor Cox of the 20th August 1905, which conveyed a message from the Sultan to the British Government to a similar effect.It will also 'be within Lord Lansdowne'B recollec tion that in May 1900 the Sultan gave to Kajor Cox the draft of a letter, which Eis Highness was prepared to sign, in wkzi which he proposed formally to request H.M.CrOverninent to dis- cugb this question on his 'behalf with the French Government# Lord Salisbury, however, was not prepared to do more than to make a friendly representation to the French Government with a view to obtaining a proper examination of the existing practice and rectification of abuses; moreover the situation underwent a change / in consequence of the Sultan 1 s visit to Sur in June 1903. Major Cox was, therefore, instructed that in the light of the view which H.M#Government had taken of the situation it did not appear that the signing of the draft letter 'by the Sultan would give to fc® the British Government any locus standi to act officially on his 'behalf 'bey on it the extent above indicated. The oposal was accordingly dropped. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Sd/~ H.

' Sir, Foreign Office, January 25, 1905. I MADE to the French Ambassador to-day a suggestion to the following effect with regard to the Muscat Arbitration:— I observed that a difficulty would arise with regard to the delivery of the Cases to the Tribunal of Arbitration, owing to the fact that the Arbitrators appointed by the two Governments had not yet had time to choose an Umpire. The Tribunal would not, therefore, be fully constituted on the day fixed for the delivery of the Cases, and it would nob consequently be possible to carry out in their entirety the provisions of Article II of the Agreement of the 13th October. It was therefore suggested that each Party should communicate to the Permanent Bureau at The Hague, on or before the 1st February, four copies of its Case. Of these one would be retained for the use of the Uureau, one reserved for eventual communication to the Umpire when appointed, and the remaining two would be forwarded at once by the Bureau to Chief Justice Fuller and M. Savornin Lohman. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE.

Foreign Office to India Office. March 13th 1906. Sir, I am directeo by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultino relative to the French Vice Consul at Maskat. It appears from that letter that His Majesty's Consul at Masqat having heard of secret arrangements made by Monsieur Billecocq to travel overland to Sur, brought the matter to the notice of the Sultan; and that His Hif^iness apparently on Uajor Grey's advice, is endeavouring to prevent Monsieur Billecocq from undertaking this journey. Lord Lansdowne is not aware that the relations of His Majesty's Government with Maskat are of a kind to justify the British Consul in pressing the Sultan to refuse to the French Vice Consul facilities for touring which the British Representa tive would presumably expect to receive as a matter of course. It seems to His Lordship that Major Grey's action will inevit ably become known to the French Government, that it will be impossible to deny that he has interfered and that His Majesty's Government0^162 ^overnnent will be placed in the disagreeable position of having either to claim rights which, to the best of His lordship's belief, they do not possess, or to admit that their representative has been more zealous than discreet.

Foreign Office, 14th February 1905. Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a note from the French 6144 F. D.74 Ambassador at this Court* stating that the French Government are unable to aa;ree to the introduction into the ^British Case, recently presented to ilic Hague Tribunal, of the name of the Sultan of Maskat as one of the parties to the discussion of the question of the issue of French flags to Alaskat dhows. Copies of the British and French Cases in this arbitration have been already communicated to you unofficially. M. Cambon's note has been referred to His Majesty's Attorney-General, and it will be seen from the Memorandum, of which a copy is inclosed, tiiat Sir R. Finlay is of opinion that the case of His Majesty's Government must naturally be also that of the Sultan of Maskat, in the sense that the acts com plained of are infringements of the sovereignty of His Highness, and that so long as the substance of the contention of His Majesty's Government that lie ha8° placed his interest in their hands is preserved, no importance need be attached to the appearance of the Sultan's name in the title or text of the British Case. In these circumstances. Lord Lansdowne would propose, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to answer the French Ambassador in the following sense :— That the terms of the Compromise of the 13th October 1904, distinctly indicate that the Sultan of Maskat is the party primarily interested in the solution of the questions at issue. That His Highness has therefore clearly a moral right to be hpard on the subject either by representing his own case, or by intrusting his interests to the care of one of the parties to the arbitration. That he has elected to commit his cause to His Majesty's Government of his own free will, and not, as appears to be implied in the Irench Case, in consequence of pressure placed upon him by the British authorities. That in these circumstances His Majesty's Government do not regard it as essential that the Sultan's name should appear as one of the plaintills in the Case, and that it will be omitted in the further documents which Llis Majesty's Government will present to the Tribunal. And finally, that His Majesty's Government propose to send copies of the correspondence to the Tribunal for their information. Lord Lansdowne would further propose that documentary evidence of the Sultan's spontaneous decision to commit his interests to His Majesty's Govern ment should be given in the British Counter-Case. Mr. Brodrick will perhaps think it desirable to consult the Government of India, as suggested by the Attorney-General, and, if so, his Lordship hopes that the reference will be made by telegraph in order that a reply may be returned to the French Ambassador's note with as little delay as possible.

I do not attach any importance either to the heading which names the Sultan or to the passages in the British case which states that he has put his interests in the hands of His Majesty's Government. In the nature of things, the Case of His Majesty's Government must be that the acts complained of are infringements on the sovereignty of the Sultan, and the Case of His Majesty's Government must in this sense be the case of the Sultan also. It was for this reason that to the statements in the body of the Case that the Sultan had put his interests into our hands there were added to the title, I think at my suggestion, the words referring to the Sultan, But the matter is one of form only, and, so long as the substance of His Majesty's Government's contention is preserved, I should feel no objection to the deletion from the Case of the passages referred to, and from the title of the * M. Cambon, February 6, 1905.00168 75 words wliich. seemed to me to be required as a logical consequence of these passages. I do not think the form is worth fighting over provided the substance of our contention is presarved. Possibly the view of the Indian Government should be taken. 13th February 1905, R. B. FINLAY.

I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to acknowledge receipt of Mr Villiers' letter of the 14th instant, transmitting a copy of a note from the French Ambassador protesting against the introduction into the British Case 3 [ICOFD]recently presented to the Hague Tribunal of the name of the Sultan of Muscat as one of the parties to the discussion of the question of the issue of French flags to Muscat dhows. In reply I am to inclose a copy of a telegram which Mr. ]3rodrick has addressed to the Government of India on the subject. On receipt of their reply a further communication will be made to you. In the meantime I am to request that you will draw Lord Lansdowne'a attention (with reference to the penultimate paiagfaph of the letter under reply (I) to the letter from the Sultan of Muscat of tne 28th May, 1897, in which His Highness asked for the help of the British Government in putting an end to the difficulty with the French Government in regard to the grant of French flags to his subjects ; and (2) to the letter from Major Cox of the 20th August, 1903, which conveyed a message from the Sultan to the British Government to a similar effect. It will also be within Lord Lansdowne's recollection that in May, 1900, the Sultan gave to Major Cox the draft of a letter, which His Highness was pre pared to sign, in which ho proposed formally to request His Majesty's Govern ment to discuss this question on his behalf with the French Government. Lord Salisbury, however, was not prepared to do more than to make a friendly representation to the French Government with a view to obtaining a proper examination of the existing practice and rectification of abuses. Moreover, the situation underwent a change in consequence of the Sultan's visit to Sur in June 1903, Major Cox was therefore instructed that, in the light of the view which His Majesty's Government had taken of the situation, it did not appear that the signing of the draft letter by the Sultan would give to theB ritish Government any locus sta7tdi to act officially on his behalf beyond the extert above indicated. The proposal was accordingly dropped. I am, &amp;o., (Signed) HORACE WALPOLE. {Received on 5f.k April 1905, with Political Secretary s Letter No. 11, dated 17th March 1905.\ AUABIA.

Lohman agreed, and M.

This refusal was notified to Mr. Fuller, and the names oC Messrs. Lardy, Becrnaert, and Asser were again submitted to him. Mr. Fuller replied that he would prefer M.

The wording of this letter conveys a suggestion that the British Government had acquiesced in the }ersons named in the list oeing under French protection, and the French Consul's objects in thus wording it were, to annoy the Sultan, and to cause him to become distrustful of the British Government. This action on the part of the French Consul is quite unjusti fiable. It warrants strong protest, and might be represented in our counter case with effect, as it amounts to prejudgment of the main question before the Tribunal.

The lis^ as put. in by t.he French with t,heir case does not, contain sufficient, particulars to enable many of the persons to be traced, and it makes no mention as to whether the proprietors possess property in a French Colony or no or of what such pro perty consists. The list was sent by r iis Highness the Sultan to Sur for verifi cation, but 4is iighness's messenger was unable to gather much additional information as those persons mentioned in the list who are now at Sur declined to discuss with him, saying that their affairs had connection with no one out the French Consul. They had obviously received instructions not to discuss their position with the messenger or to give him any information, 'lis statement is attached (List A). On March 25th, the French Vice Consul in circumstances separately dealt with endeavoured to press upon His Highness's acceptance another list, a copy of which is attached (list B). It will be seen that this differs considerably from the list put in with the case, which would suggest that the latter had not been very carefully revised. Moreover list B contains even fewer particulars than that sub mitted vith the case, as it has no names of captains, and the numbers 01 boats and crews are given as approximate only. -The boats irequently change hands, by sale and otherwise, and nev captains are orten appointed either permanently or tempora rily.

Attached to this note are translations of six letters received at different times from the Sultan between 1891 and 1905, all showing his steadfast desire that the British Government should look after his interests in connection with the French flag question. I will briefly comment of the several enclosures— No. 1, dated 11th June 1891,. to Political Agent, Maskat. Needs no special comment. No. 2, dated 28th May 1697, to Political Agent, Maskat. Needs no special comment. No. 3, Communication, dated 16th May 1900, Political Agent, Maskat» to Foreign Department. So far as His Highness was concerned he was ready to sign the draft letter but before taking it from him finally, it seemed advisable to ask Government if they desired any emendations before he signed it. Before any reply was received on this point the Sultan had proceeded to Soor and had met with a convenient opportunity of acting for himself, and after that the need for sub mitting his letter formally to Government ceased to exist. Since my arrival at Maskat a few days ago the draft letter, which is in the handwriting of the Sultan's clerk, was shown and read to His Highness, together with the originals of the other letters of which translations are attached, and he unhesitatingly signified his recollection of them and his acceptation of them at the present date and for purposes of the Hague Tribunal. This communication can, therefore, be used with the others if necessary, but if we do use it, we must remember to explain that, before Government had an opportunity of replying, Seyyid Peisal had proceeded to Soor and the Flagholders had agreed to discard their French Articles and accordingly it was never answered. Now, however, that we have got the letter forming enclosure No. 6, and dated 19th March 1905, perhaps the other letters will b e superfluous. No. 4. This letter forwarded a long communication from the Sultan to Monsieur Laronce, enlarging on the injustice of the action of the French Government in the matter of the flags. A copy was forwarded to the Government of India with Maskat No. 460 of 30th November 1901, to gether with the French Consul's reply and the Sultan's further rejoinder, in which, it is important to note, His Highness gave the direct lie to the statement alleged to have been made by him to Commodore Kiesel, vide Part II, page 10 of French case. No. 5. This letter forwards Monsieur Laronce's letter dated 23rd Janu ary 1902 and is given in Appendix No. 27 of our case. No. 6. This is a letter addressed me by His Highness the Sultan on 19th instant, I having asked him for it under instruction from the Gov ernment of India in conformation of the conversation reported in Maskat letter No. 425 of August 20th, 1903. It seems to place the Sultan's sentiments beyond doubt. P. Z. COX, Major, The 2Ut March, 1905.

After compliments, —We have to inform you that some of our subjects, inhabitants of Soor and its neighbourhood and of the Batineh who are going to and returning from the African coasts and from Aden in their vessels, obtain from the representatives of the Great French Government flags (for their boats) of that Government on the grounds that they possess land and reside (in French territories) and thereby by obtaining French flags find a means to conceal their real object which is well known. We maintain that a person is subject of his country of origin and is free to buy or sell in all places, but by doing this he cannot change his nationality even'when he resides or possesses property (in Foreign country). In all countries there are men of different nationalities and even though they have children born in such country, they cannot change their nationality by reason of their staying in such foreign land, unless they remain in the country where they have become naturalized. The above is contrary to law and detrimental to our interest, and it has therefore become incuinbent upon us to write to ask the help and consideration of the Great Government in putting an end to the difficulty mentioned. We are overwhelmed with the great favours of Government and we thank them and you for kindnesses accorded to us. And Salaam.

From—Ihe Political Agent, Maskat, To—Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. ' I have the honour to address you regarding the matter of the French flags which are handed about among my subjects, inhabitants of Soor and elsewhere. You are cognizant of the circumstances of the case and we have many times discussed the question, and 1 am much vexed with regard to it as it is detrimental both to my independence and to my prestige. Moreover, quite lately, as you are probably aware, there has been quarrelling amongst sections of mV subjects over this matter, in that the tribe of Hijre-ee called upon the Jennebeh inhabitants of Soor in a threatening missive to return their French papers and I fear that harm may result. I never cease to be distracted by this matter of the French flags and I have many times called upon the French Consul to represent the matter to his Government and to explain to them my wishes and to obtain from them a plain answer : but up to the present I have obtained nothing tangible from him, and the practice has not been put an end to. Now I am aware that it is the custom for political questions between your two great Governments in these parts to be discussed and settled by communication between high officials of your respective Governments in Europe. I therefore now write to say that if your Great Gov-4 emment can see its way to discuss the question with the great French Govern ment on my behalf with a view to effecting the removal of the flags, now in use, and the discontinuance of the practice for the future, I shall be extremely grateful and obliged.'

FEISAL BIN TURKI. Dated JJaskatt llth Moharram 1323. 19th March 1905.^^209 iW3 Memorandum regarding the history of the Khoja Community now in Oman. With reference to the observations made in Regard to them at the end of I art IV of the t rench Case^ ^ where they are referred to as ' Les Louwatiya.' The Indian name for persons of this sect is c: Klioja,' but in Maskat they are generally known as ' Louwatias' or ' Hyd^rabadi^,' owing to the fact that many of them are migrants from Ilyderabad, Sind. A few also hail from Kutch or other parts of Kattywar. The name Khoja is hardly heard at all in Maskat either among the people themselves or the general public ; they are generally denominated in local correspondence and office petitions as ' Hydera- badis.' The sect is of Hindu origin, but were pi obably converted to Muham- madanism in some form during the paramountcy of the Kalhora Dynasty in Sind about 400 years ago. A general history of the Maskat Khojas was compiled in 188^ by Colonel S. H. Miles, then Political Agent at Maskat, and the substance.of his report was included in printed compilation of the Govern ment of India known as ' Narrative of Maskat Affairs, 1869 to 1893 ^ I It is important to note that the whole community reside in an enclosed fort or enclosure in Mutrah which is recognised as their peculiar property, and in which no one else is permitted to reside. This so-called ' Khoja Fort ' dates from the times when there was no security in Mutrah from Bedouin attacks, and when it was consequently necessary for any alien person or collec tion of persons to take adequate measures for the protection of themselves and their property. The religion and customs of the community differ widely from those of the Beazi Omanis, among whom they live. Much of their ritual, their code of laws especially in connection with succession and landed property are peculiar to themselves, and they do not submit in such matters to the Mullahs of Omen, but have their own distinct representatives. ^ Both in India and elsewhere, however, the sect has been much disinte grated bv various iuternal schisms, and in India so much so that in 1^78 a Commission was appointed for the purpose of investigating ' the customs and views of both divisions of the Khoja sect in the Presidency of Bombay and elsewhere ' and this resulted in 1884 in a Draft Bill being framed of which a copv was sent to the Political Agent at Maskat with the request that he would 'obtain the opinion of the Khoja community in Maskat on the proposed , ^ ^ iaqi f Hill. The whole community was doubt- Foreign Department letter No. 1931-B„ dated the 26th July 1874. less here referred to whether or Maskat or British Nationalitv, and I merely mention the correspondence here to demon strate how distinct a community the Khojas of Maskat are from the rest of the population, and how closely their affairs are hound up with those of their eo- religionists in India. In consideration of the above facts it seems only natural and logical that we should havie arranged with the rulers of Oman that that section of the com- \ munitv which had migrated to Maskat, after the Annexation of Smd m Ibio, should be considered as under the protection of the British Government. It is important to note here that at other ports in these waters whether it be Persia or the Pirate Coast a Khoja is, as a matter of course regarded as a British Subiect, that is to say, there is no question of the date of his arrival, the mere fact that he is of the K hoja sect is taken as sufficient evidence of his British nationality just as much as if he were a Hindu banian. In brief therefore, it will be seen that we only claim as British subjects those who came to Oman after the annexation of Smd, and the copies of past correspondence which I attach will demonstrate how strictly we have adhered to that position. I will now proeeed to deal seriatim with the several statements on the subject of Khojas which we find at the end of Part IV of the French Case.(a) The Case of Fadl bin Mihram (or Meeran). The Maskat records at present available do not go back beyond 1860, and I cmnot trace the original record of the case, but copies of letters which passed on the subject have been found in another correspondence and they bear data 14th Shawal 1274, corresponding to the English date 1858. It would appear from a memorandum written by the Revd. G. P. Badger, in charge of the Maskat-Zanzibar Commission, under bis No. 11 of 6th June 1861, that different instructions had previously been issued by Captain Felix Jones, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the general subject of the protec tion of Khojas or others in Maskat, but the orders conveyed in the two letters accompanying were evidently issued under authority and have since formed the basis of our treatment of Khojas in Maskat. They are in themselves a complete answer to the French reference to the case Fadl Mihram (or Meeran). (b) I have not been able to trace any correspondence on this subject during the sultanates of Seyyid Salim bin Thoweynee or the Imam Azzan, but it is evident from the enclosures that before their time, the matter had been placed on a basis which was quite definite and well understood. (c) Seyyid Turki was indeed in all matters more friendly and amenable in his relations with the British, but there is nothing on record to support the French statement that during his reign there was any fresh or special transfer of Khojas to the British flag, nor does such a proceeding seem possible in view of the clear definition on which the Political Agent had instructions to work. (d) It is impossible that Colonel Miles could have published such a noti fication. No such notification can be traced and no doubt the French remarks in this connection refer to the one of the ordinary annual or periodical notices directing British subjects to register themselves. I may mention that such notices have been found to be of little use here. The population of Maskat varies very little. British protected persons or families are well known both to the Consulate and to the local authorities, but they will not come forward in response to a notice of the kind under reference, and pay the fee necessary for the acquirement of a fresh registration paper. In making this observation I refer to all British protected persons whether they be Khojas or Hindoo banians. TheMifficulty is generally and conveniently met by the Political Agent levying the fee the next time the defaulting individual has requisition to the Consular Office or Court. (e) I am not aware that His Highness Seyyid Faisal has e,ver made any protest on the subject of the protection by us of the Khojas to the extent that we have always done. (/) The figures given regarding the numbers and nationalities of the Khoja at Gwadur and Maskat are inaccurate and misleading. Taking Maskat first 1 may mention that I went into the matter when preparing a note on Maskat for the Foreign Department in connection with the visit of His Excel* lency the Viceroy to Maskat. At that time I stated the number of Khojas under British protection in Maskat to be about 500 souls. Fresh inquiries have been made since my arrival here a few days ago with the following result. There are stated to be 1,050 souls altogether on the Khoja quarter, of these 250 are adult males and the remainder women and children. Of the 250 males only 120 (approximately) are entitled to British protection together with their families. The remainder (130 males with their families) are subjects of the Sultan. It will be seen therefore that my previous estimate was approxi* mately correct, but if anything somewhat over the mark. (ff) In Gwadur the position of the Khojas is on a different basis from that of Maskat. Gwadur, it must be remembered, has only been an appanage of the Muscat Sultanate for a little more than 100 years, the port having been presented to the present Sultan's forbear, Seyyid Sultan bin Ahmed, by the Khan of Kahelat. All the Khojas there are comparatively recent arrivals: offshoots as a rule from Karachi and Sind families with whom they live in close and constant social and commercial intercourse.I have ascertained that their are 309 souls belonging to this sect now in Gwadur, who without exception claim British nationality, liesides these there would be a few Maskat Khojas, subjects of the Sultan, who have for the time migrated to Gwadur for purposes of trade. (h) With reference to the case of ' Abdul Hussein bin Fadl,' I have recorded a separate memorandum which I trust will be found to give a satis factory explanation of it. I beg to revert for a moment in conclusion to the general question of the protection of Khojas in Maskat. While objecting on principle, as long as they are treated as our subjects, to individual members of the sect doffing or don ning their British nationality for purposes of temporary convenience or evasion of commercial obligation, I do not regard the community as by any means a valuable asset to us as subjects of the British Government At the same time it would I think be hardly conducive to their interests or to our prestige, for us suddenly to withdraw protection from them. In fact when we see around us representatives of foreign Powers leaving no stone unturned to create interests by the manufacture of proteges, we can ourselves hardly afford to throw away our own without very strong grounds. Among the enclosures to this note I have included a copy of the first notifica tion on record issued by Colonel Ross, warning British subjects to register themselves. It has formed the basis of all subsequent notifications in this connection. It may perhaps be important to note, that whatever may be said of our protection of these Khojas, the letters which are herewith produced dating from 1858, prove that the position was clearly and openly established at that time, which was considerably anterior to the declaration of 1862.

Form ing accompaniment to letter to British Agent at Mascat, dated 14th Shawal 1274 (=1858) below. After Compliments. Your letter dated 2nd Bamzan has been received and its contents under stood, on the subject of the person named Fadhl Meeran, a Khoja whom Your Highness understands to be one of your subjects having been born in the port of Muscat, and requesting me to forbid the British Agent Hezheil bin Eusof interfering on his behalf. Yesterday Fadhl bin Meran came to me himself, and I explained to him fully that he was not entitled to protection as a British subject, and that he is one of your Highness's subjects. Our .4 gent is not authorized to interfere in his behalf, as was explained in my letter to Your Highness's address of last Shawal. I have furnished our Agent with written instructions on the subject of which I hand you a copy in order that he may not interfere in such matters. Copy of letter by Captain Jones on the subject of Khojas residing in Muscat to Hezheil bin Eusof, British Agent at Muscat, dated 14ith Showal 1274. ( = 1858). It is not unknown to you as I have written to you before regarding the Khojas of Sind that they are subjects of the British Government, and it is your duty to assist and protect them, but it is requisite that I should further instruct you that those residing in Muscat who were born there and were sub jects of the late Sultan of Muscat before Hyderbad of Sind became part of the British possessions are not included as British subjects and are not registered as being under protection, and you should not interfere in their behalf.8 Original specimen of Notification issued ly 'Political Agent and Eis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat, re registration of British Subjects.

In acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 625-294, dated 18th June, forwarding for compliance copy of letter No. 1465-P., dated 19th May, from the Secretary to the Government of India requesting answers to certain questions regarding the Indian Khojas and Mascat to enable Government to determine the matter of the Political Agent's jurisdiction over them, I have the honour to submit herewith the information called for accordingly. Memorandum of queries and replies. I. Do the Khojas of Maskat preserve a peculiar religion and peculiar social habits of their own or do they combine with other com munities. The Khojas at Maskat do not combine with other communities. They dwell in a separate walled quarter at Mutrah called the Khoja Fort and intermarry only among themselves. They comprise two parties, viz., the followers of Agha Khan, who preserve their peculiar religion and social customs, and those who have recently adopted the Muhammadan religion. The latter are in the majority, but even those notwithstanding preserve some of their old social habits. 2. Are there any Khojas who are beyond question subjects of the Sultan ? 2. If there are, do the Indian Khojas intermix with them or do the Indian Khojas form a separate community preserving an immiscible character ? 4. Do the members of the Khoja com munity at Maskat come from India only or from other parts of the world as well ? 5. Are there any general considerations which prevent Khoja immigrants from ac quiring the nationality of Maskat ? 6. Is the Sultan a party to the Register of persons under British protection, or has he notice of it, and has he ever objected to the practice of registration ? 7. 'When Khojas born at Maskat of Indians parents come of age, are their names entered in the Register ? 8. Are names ever entered in the Register except at the request or with the consent of the persons themselves ? 9. Is it the open and acknowledged prac tice to treat adult Maskat born descendants of Indian born immigrants to Maskat as pro tected natives of India. Yes. Such as those whose ancestors emi grated from Sind prior to British conquest and such as have declared themselves Arab subjects. They are one and the same community and intermix. The Khojas are Indians and come from the provinces of Sind and Cutch, I am not aware of any general considera tions which would prevent Khoja immigrants from acquiring Arab nationallity if they pre ferred to do so. The registration of persons is done with the Sultan's cognisance, but notice is not usually given him. He has never formally objected to the practice of registration so far as I am aware, but he has been furnished at his own request with a list of persons registered. Yes. On application being made by them. Names are never entered in the Register unless at the personal request of the persons and after investigation. It b^s always been the custom to treat adult Maskat born descendants of Indian immi grants as protected subjects provided ^ the immigrants were themselves British subjects or subjects of protected States, provided also the descendants themselves desire to be so treated. H. B. MILES, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent, H, B. M»s Contul, Maskat,no 10 Memorandum regarding the case of Abdul Hussein bin Fadl AH mentioned on page 19 of French Statement. Among the trading firms of Mascat and Mutrah is the British protected Khoja firm of t( Fadl Aii Toorani &amp; Co.,'-trading with Bombay and Calcutta. Owing to the fact that its founder, Fadl Ali, migrated from India after the British Annexation of Sind and also that the trading operation of the firm are carried on with India, both the family and the firm have always enjoyed British protection. Fadj Ali died many years ago and left four sons who continued to carry on the business of the firm in his name. The eldest of these was Abdul Rab bin Fadl Ali and the second Abdul Hussein bin Fadl Ali, the individual referred to in the French Statement. The elder of the two became the head of the firm, still trading as ' Fadl Ali Toorani &amp; Co. In September 1901, when Political Agent at Muscut, T received for execution from the Calcutta Small Cause Court a decree against the firm for a considerable amount and from reports which reached me at the time of the state of the firm's affairs I had reason to think that other similar claims from India were likely to follow. On the 9th January (1902) following, a petition was presented to me by the elder brother, Abdul Rab, asking that his name might be removed from the Register of British Subjects. No application of the sort was received at this time or any other from Abdul Hussein, but as far as my memory serves me he did present himself with his brother, when I called for the latter on 13th January 1902. On this occasion I explained to Abdul Rab, who offered no explanation of his wish suddenly to doff his British nationality, that while the British Government did not thrust their protection on people, nevertheless, seeing that he and his father had always hitherto claimed our protection, before I could take steps to take his name off the Register, I must ask for six months' notice and a substantial deposit as security for the satisfaction of any more claims that might come in against him as a British subject. It will be understood that there were strong grounds for thinking that his only object in desiring to take Muscat nationality in this sudden way was that it would be easier for him to evade as an Arab subject claims tha t might come against him from British India. He did not see his way to deposit any security and went his way and I heard no more of his desire to change his nationality. He died a few months later. I may mention that I had always been on good terms with this Khoja, and he had always been one of the foremost in conveying expressions of loyalty to the British Government on official occasions, such as the King s Birthday and the 1st January. In December 1903 a suit was brought against the second brother, Abdul Hussein, in the Maskat Consular Court in connection with the title to possess a certain plot of ground. Defendant was, as usual, summoned to appear, but refused to accept the summons and a warrant had to be issued. On hearing of this Abdul Hussein came to see me of his own accord and said he had refused to sign the summons because he had, since his brother's application of two years before, considered himself a Maskat subject. I explained to him that I could not accept this explanation; that his brother had never completed the requirements for the removal of his name from the Register, and that, under the circumstances, I could not consider him, Abdul Hussein, as anything else than a British Subject. He accepted my decision in the suit without further appeal, and I had no dispute of any kind with His High ness the Sultan on the subject. If I saw him personally within a few days of taking the above action I should certainly have mentioned the matter to him and probably did, but I have no special recollection of doing so and His Highness certainly never addressed me any official communication on the subject. The course taken by me seems to me to have been a perfectly proper and natural one. If the Political Agent were to allow persons in the position of Abdul Hussein to evade their obligations by suddenly doffing their nationality there would be no limit to it.11 Mj successor at Muscat, Major Grey, has had considerable dealings with Abdul Hussein in the Consular Court and informs me that the Khoja has never suggested any wish on his own part to change his nationality, and there can be hardly any doubt that his object in endeavouring to do so on the previous occa sion in question was the one which I have suggested. P. Z. COX, Major, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Maskat ; The 17th March 1905.. S|i*w regular monthly summary of the 12 Note on the modus operandi of Soori 'dhows tinder the French Hag plying between Bonihay and Oman ports loith cargoes of food-stuffs during the period 1900 to 1905. Please read the opening paragraph of Part V of the French Statement : ' Jamais nos proteges n'ont donne au Sultan, etc., etc.' It can be conclusively proved that the above statements are altogether at variance with the actual facts — («) The present Sultan of Maskat has during the past constantly com plained that the French flagholders at Soori habitually evade payment of his legitimate 5 per cent, customs dues, wholly or partially. So much so that in 1901 he addressed me on the subject when Political Agent at Maskat, and in due course his representations were communicated to the Government of India, and subsequently under Maskat Office No. 495, dated 27th December 1901, the Political Secretary to the Government of Bombay was communicated with on the subject. A copy of it forms enclosure No. 1 to this note and I invite special attention to paragraph 3 thereof. From that time up to date the Government of Bombay have been ^ood enough to supply the Sultan through the Political with returns. (A specimen of them is forwarded for inspection). In view of the French statements quoted above a tabular returns has now been prepared (Enclosure No. 3). It consists of a list of French Flag dhows which have visited Bombay and cleared again for Oman ports during the past four years together with a record of the chief items of their manifested cargo. Being the ordinary record of a very efficient Government Department its general accuracy must be considered as unquestionable. The state of things disclosed by the compilation affords very interesting corroboration of the Sultan's firm suspicions as represented in my letter No. 425 above quoted. I would allude here to the fact that Soor is a port containing according to common computation about 10,000 inhabitants. It not only gets all its own supplies, in the way of grain, from outside but is also the port through which nearly all the import and export trade of the Sharkiyeh and Jalaan districts of Oman are carried on. Tbe foodstuffs brought into Soor thus provide for the wants not only of its 10,000 inhabitants but also of many thousands more of the Sultan's subjects residing in the interior. In this connection it will be seen from another accompaniment that whereas the Sultan, owing to the French flag difficulty, now only gets about 8 000 dollars per annum from the port, he considers that it should produce not less than 50,000 dollars, au opinion which any one with local knowledge will endorse and which 1 have repeatedly stated in official reports of the last six years. Turn now to Maseerah Island and treat it from the same point of view. Recent research in connection with the new Gazetteer now under preparation elicits the fact that— ' The inhabitants, about 1,000 in number, are all Jennebeh except a few Hikman famllies. , ' Their food is fish, turtles, and dates, with rice and flesh as occasional luxuries. Women and children eat shellfish.' To such a population comparatively enormous quantities of rice are conveyed from Bombay, if we are to believe the Soor dhow-owners. The Bombay returns show that during the past five years French flagholders alone have 44 manifested ' for Maseera alone 23,H76 bags of rice, i.e. 23 bags of 168 lbs. each per head of population, by French dhows alone, whereas only 12,023 hags of rice. (i e. half the quantity sent to Maseera) were imported to Soor, a town with a population ten times the size and with a brisk hinterland provisioning trade to boot. I would furthermore draw pointed attention to the fact that it is i 0 ■ m~ ^ 4- 'urtr. n 1 tt f i v7 orv nnralooaotim rr i n otti/i 1 would turmermore uraw puiuocu aLtcuuiuu lu tuo iauo uuao iu is this island of Maseera that has only recently be^n so unpleasantly in evidence in connection with the massacre of a whole boatload of European survivors from the shipwrecked steamer Baron Inner dale. The Jennebeh Tribe by which Maseera is mainly inhabited is the same tribe from which the chief and majority of the French flagholders have been recruited. The two settlements (Soor and Maseera) are connected by the closest tribal and kindred ties; in fact Maseerah may almost be regarded as an appanage of Soor. 0021513 The fact of course is, as originally represented by the Sultan, that the French flagholders (and others also who are enabled with impunity to follow their example) fraudulently inform the officials of the Bombay Customs that their cargoes are destined for Maseera (or other ports whereat the Sultan cannot conveniently arrange for the institution of a Customs post owing to the turbulence of the inhabitants), but actually smuggle them into Soor. On arrival at Soor they bring their goods ashore secretly or even openly and then shew their manifest to the individual in charge of the Customs, and throw him perhaps a moiety of the duty which would be due on the goods manifested to Soor alone. In the above we seem to have a very strong argument. 'We can both contend that the goods are obviously not really destined to Maseera though manifested there, and also that the French flagholders are evidently closely connected with their relatives on Maseera and provide them with the neces saries of life, and that it is these,very islanders who have recently been res ponsible for the massacre of 17 shipwrecked Europeans. P. z. COX. March 21st, 1905. No. 495, dated the 27th December 1901. From— Major P. Z. Cox, His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent&gt; Maskat, To—The Secretary to Government in the Political Department, Bombay. I have the honour to acknowledge your letters Nos. 7548 and 8825, dated 30th October and 20th December respectively, asking for the names of ports under the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Maskat; and regret that owing to the absence of the Sultan and myself from Maskat I have been unable to reply before now. 2. A list of the principal Oman ports in order of occurrence from south to north accompanies—the most important being underlined. 3. With regard to Soor (No. 5) it is believed that the Nakhodas of the large dhows hailing from that port which annually take foodstuffs from Bombay are in the habit of getting bogus destinations inserted in their manifests. For instance, a Nakhoda about to convey 500 bags of rice from Bombay to Soor would state at Bombay that 50 bags were destined for Soor and 450 bags were destined for Aden, Makulleh, or other port outside Maskat Jurisdiction or small Oman port, suoh as Nos, 2, 3, 4, where no Customs collection is at present feasible. They then smuggle their cargo on shore at nisrht, and when asked for duty deny all but the smaller amount. It is difficult to see how any check is to be put on this practice by the Customs authorities in Bombay, but it would make the offence easier of detection by the Sultan, if the actual date of sailing from Bombay could be ascertained as accurately as possible, so that the allegations of the Nakhoda as to having returned to Oman via Makulleh, etc., could be checked by the period of time found to have been taken en route. It would be convenient, therefore, if the headings of the draft monthly return could be altered as follows :— Column 3 (altered to) ({ Name of owner and port of domicile.' Column 5 (altered to) ' Destination and date of sailing/' 4. If it is possible for returns to be furnished in arrears since January 1900, only statistics for ports 1 to 5 inclusive would be necessaryfor that period. 5. In conclusion I am desired by His Highness the Sultan to express his acknowledgments to the Government of Bombay for their courtesy in undertaking to supply him with this information.

In a separate note regarding the modus operandi of Soori dhows plying under the French flag I have given one instance of the difficulties which the existence of the flag among his subjects places in the way of the Sultan. I could, if time admitted, give many instances in which persons under British protection have failed to recover claims from so-called French proteges which they would have been able to realise through the Sultan if the defendants had been loyal subjects of His Highness. For present purposes it will perhaps be sufficient to quote the case of Dewal bin Lilla, a Hindu British subject who has for many years resided at Soor for purposes of trade. He was for several years farmer of the Sultan's customs at the Port of Soor, and having once got involved he was obliged to take on the contract from year to year in the hope of beinsr able to recover his outstandings. He was unable to do so however, retired from the ' farm' and is now in very humble circumstances, almost entirely owing to the existence of the French flag difficulty at Soor. Some of his debts date bick 6 op 7 yeirs, and mo^t of them have not been inquired into at all, and during my tenure of the appointment of Politi cal Agent at Maskat I have many times endeavoured to get the Sultan to eiTeot a settlement, on one occasion v^hen he was actually at Soor. Asa matter of fact, however, the Hindus themselves know it is not to their interests or conducive to their personal safety under the present Government to have their claims forcibly extracted, and prefer to wait in the hope of the French flag difficulty being removed and of the Sultan being able to assert himself more vigorously. On the'22nd November last the Political Agent at Maskat, Major Grey, addressed the Government of India in connection with this case under his No. 56 id of 1901), but on the matter being referred to m% I expressed the opinion that as the case had waited so long, it; would not be prejudiced if it were held in abeyance until the case before the tribunal had been decided. Since coming here a few days ago I have addressed a letter on the subject to His Highness the Sultan and enclose a copy of his reply and of my o^n letter. His Hi^hneFS Seyyid Feisal's letter shows clearly how the case stands and how the actton of the French proteges indirectly results in a loss to him of some 40,000 dollars. The letter from Shaikh Hamood bin Sultan referred to in His Highness's letter, and of which a copy is also attached, furnishes a good instance of the contumelious behaviour which he invariably experiences from the French fla^-holders and which incenses him so against them. P. z. COX. The 2Ut arch 1905. Translation of a letter from Major Cox to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, dated lUth March 1905. After Complements. I have to address Your Highness concerning the claims of a certain British subject named Dewal, a Bania resident of Sur who was formerly customs farmer at that port. After the period of his management of the customs expired, he brought claims against some of the rich people of Sur, some of whom were acknowledged subjects of Your Highness while che others considered themselves to be under French protection. Now these claims, which ha\e been outstanding for seven years, were pressed upon Your High ness time after time both verbally and in writing and my successor Major Grey has also applied for justice regarding them, but they are still unsettled, not- withstandiu' that Your Highness spares no elfort to recover the claims of22 British Subjects and that your efforts are usually successful, nthat is the reason then, that the claims cannot bo recovered in this case.^ Also will Your Highness kindly inform me as to the actual customs revenue of the port of Sur, and what that revenue would be if the customs arrangements were in a proper state. Also what is the reason for their not being in a more satisfactory condition ? I should also be obliged if Your Highness would tell me wiiat is the popu lation of the port of Sur roughly ?

Translation of a letter received by Major Cox from His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, dated 19th March 1905. After Compliments. —In reply to your question regarding the debts owing to Dewal. Your honour understood from the letter which I received from Hamood bin Sultan at the time of my visit (to Sur) the refusal of the debtors to come to me in order that I might examine them concerning Dewal's claims and the Customs dues. This refusal was on account of most of them claiming French protection, which is the reason for their declining to pay their creditors. Then as to the Customs revenue at Sur. The actual revenue is about 8,000 dollars (only), as most of the (proprietors of the) boats claim French pro tection, and the cargoes are hidden and their value concealed. If the Customs were conducted in a satisfactory manner the revenue would reach 50,000 dollars, and the want of proper arrangements is due to the opposition shewn by the people who suppose themselves to be under French protection to the Superin tendent of Customs and the Governor, regarding the amounts of Customs duty due by them; they do not pay the common rate per cent, which is demanded from them. Then as to the population of Sur, it is about 10,000 persons. This is what had to be explained and Salaam. Dated 12th Moharram, 1323. ^ = 19th March 1905. } FAISAL BIN TURKI.

Cnmbon and neither I nor my successor Major Grey have ceased to remind Government of the vital importance to us of its possession before vve proceeded with this case before the Ha^ue Tribunal. Had we had a copy of it a few months ago our statement could have been much more complete. As it is, a list has been furnished with the French Statement, but in such a sketchy form that it is practically useless for purposes of verification. In this connection the Sultan has addressed me a letter this day expressing his own views with regard to it, with which I fully concur. I submit the letter in case it may be of use in enabling us to press for a list in the only form which will be entirely satisfactory. It appears to me, judging from the records here and from personal know ledge that the French have decided that they will lose nothing by credit ing individuals with more dhows than they really possess and with much more numerous crews than they really employ. According to their figure they claim to protect 1,050 adult persons in Soor. Now the total population of Soor, women and children included, is oniyabout 10,000, and of those not more than two-fifths would be adult males, so that the French claim to protect at least a quarter of the population. The Sultan's reference to the three dead men on the list requires no com ment, Compare Monsieur Laronce's action in the recent Debai case where he lodged a claim in behalf of a man who had been dead two years. It is also interesting to note that one of the dead men mentioned in the at tached letter from the Sultan, namely, Salim bin Mahomed* el-Badi (or Libadi) No. 22 in French list, was the subject of report by my predecessor Major Fagan in 1897. I attach a copy of the letter referred to and suggest that it might be made use of, as it shows the lax principles on which the French enroll their proteges. I suggest to that we should without fail make the most of the inclusion by the French of these three dead men, in our present state ment to go in on 1st May. If we do not the French will find out their mistake and deprive us of the chance of scoring a point over it. In connection with this list I beg to report that Major Grey on getting a copy of it gave it to the Sultan with the request that he would take steps to have the names identified. His Highness addressed me on this subject in the letter which forms the first enclosure to this note, but he had previously sent down a trusted representative to Soor with instructions to collect what information he could get with regard to the names on the list. His retainer who left here about a week ago for Soor has replied to the Sultan this evening that the French protege refused to give him any information or have any intercourse with him whatever and referred him to the French Consul. Added to this the French Consul has just been asking the Sultan for a boat to take him down to Soor. From this it would appear that the French intend to prime the proteges thoroughly as to what to say and to refuse to communicate with the Sultan or his representative except through the French Consul and thus frustrate any satisfactory inquiry into the status of the proteges. These considerations prompt me to urge very strongly the impor tance of getting in the list in a proper form, however much the Irench may endeavour to evade giving it. P. Z. COX, Major, March 2l8t 1905. Copy of a letter addressed to the Political Resident in the Versian Mis Highness the Sultan of Maskat, dated 24th Muhanum 102?, {~lst March 1905), After compliments. —I have the honour to make a reference to you regarding the 30 persons from among my subjects whom the French Govern ment claim to protect, together with their dhows and the creus thereot,26 according 40 the list furnished to me a few days ago. As a matter of fact the details given in the list (as now supplied) are not sufficient for the proper identification of the individuals, and I see in the list possibilities of doubt and confusion in the matter of identity, for instance one of them is quoted as ' Juma bin Saeed ' and his dhow the ' Fateh-el-Khair ' and its Nacoda ' Khalfan bin Ahmed' ; and, God knows, there may be 20 persons in Soor of the name of 'Juma bin Saeed' or Khalfan bin Ahmed ' and similarly there might be 20 dhows named the Fateh-el-Khair Until such time therefore as the fullest inquiry can be made with regard to each person named in the list, with opportunities for the production of witnesses and documents I cannot admit that any single one of those mentioned is entitled to French protection. Accordingly it Las been necessary to inform you to that effect. The details which I require in regard to the claimants are as follows ;— The individual's name, such as Mubarak (bin). H is fathers name, „ Salim (bin). His grandfather 's name, „ Mahomed. His nickname, if any „ ' El Katberee'. His clan or sub-tribe ,, Fowaris. His tribe „ Jennebeh. That is Mubarak bin Salim bin Mahomed El Katheree Clan Fowaris, Tribe Jennebeh. I beg you will obtain this information for me, and communicate it to me. Apart from the above request I note that among the individuals named on this list whose names I recognise as belonging to persons whom I can identify ( as claiming French protection) are included several persons long since dead. How can the French Government include such in their list? Those to whom I refer are three in number— (1) Salim bin Mahomed A1 Badi (No 93 on French list). (2) Seleem b n Thibet (No. 14 „ „ ,,). (3) Ahmed bin Saeed (No. 22 „ „ „). This is what had to be explained, and Salaam. (Signed) FEISAL BIN TURKI, Sultan of Maskat. Dated 14th Muharrum 1322. Copy of a letter addressed hy Major C. Fag an 'Political Agent at Maskat, to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 31, dated 20th January 1898. ******* Paragraphs 1 to 4 inclusive refer to the two French protected slave dhows captured by the Sphinx respectively named the Salama and the Saad (disconnected correspondence). ******* (5) I am informed that it is quite a common thing for inhabitants of Soor, the Batineh Coast, and other places in the Persian Gulf * * * * to send their dhows down to French settlements and fraudulently represent that they belong to inhabitants living in those places, thus obtaining French papers and the right to fly the French Flag. (6) The following is a case in point. About two or three months ago Abdul Mohsin, an inhabitant of the island of Keis (Persian Territory), made a complaint to the Sultan of Maskat against one Yusuf bin Saeed of the Yal Saad tribe, an inhabitant of Mesnaa, Batineh Coast, to the effect that this indi vidual was the Nacoda of complainant's dhow, and while serving in this capa city took the dhow to Bookeyn (a port in Madagascar) and fraudulently obtained French papers for the dhow, which he registered in the name of Salim hin Mahomed al Badi, who was at the time living in French territory, but was originally a subject of the Sultan of Maskat. The complainant represented also that the Nacoda has at the same time returned to Mesnaa on the Batineh, and had beached the dhow and put her up to auction.27 (7) On receiving this complaint the Sultan ordered the Wali to make inquiries into the case, which he did, with the result that the complainant's story was found to be correct. Salim bin Mahomed el B:idi, who happened to be at Mesnaa at the time, took over the papers and the French flag from the Nacoda of the dhow and returned them to the Wali. I am informed that there has been some correspondence on the subject between the Sultan and the French Vice-Consul. (8) I beg to add in conclusion that the two Nacodas alluded to in para graph 9 of my letter No. 25, dated 14th instant, as still undergoing a term of imprisonment, inflicted on them by the Court at Borbou, were released on the 18th instant, at the request of the French Vice-Censul.

Now the loss of the buggalow has been proved to you and the injustice which the man has received is obvious, and the Kazi s decision which the oppressor was prevailed upon to accept was for a trifling sum, whereas the vessel was worth 2,000, dollars.

Objects for which French Consulate at Maskat was inaugurated, namely, cultivation of proteges and opposition to British Influence,28 Note in regard to the admitted object of the Trench Government in appointing a Consul to Maskat, In Part I of the French Case headed' DE LA FRANCISATION DIS BOUTRES INDIGENE. ' (Page 6 lines, 48 to 61), reference is made to the inauguration of their Consulate at Maskat on 24ith January 1894. It may be useful to us to draw attention in reference to this paragraph, in our rejoinder to the speeches at the debate started in the French Chamber by Monsieur Deloncle of which the dispatch of Monsieur Ottavi to Maskat was the immediate result. A copy of their report of our Ambassador in Paris on this subject was forwarded to the Government of India under India Office No. 60, dated 10th February 1893, from the Political Secretary to the Secretary in the Foreign Department. Monsieur Deloncle opened his speech in favour of the institution of a Vice-Consulate at Maskat by referring to the recently concluded Russian, alliance daily becoming firmer, and continued (&lt; nous avons en mdme temps signe avee elle une sorte de convention qui ne s'applique seulement aux choses d'Europe.' He then went on to say that the French flag was un known in the Persian Gulf, where Russian influence alone placed any check upon the progress of England, and proceeded to explain how very necessary it had now become for France' d'immatriculer le plus t6t possible les boutres de nos sujets ou proteges Omanis et Arabes du Golfe Persique et de la c6te Arabique, qui vont et viennent entre Mascate, Obock, Djibouti, Aden, Bombay et Zanzibar, sous peine de les voir passer sous le pavilion britannique. Je consid&amp;re qu'il est du devoir et de le honnour de la France d'avoir la-bas un Agent consulaire, si modeste qu'il soit pour ouvrir un registre de nos nationaux proteges et clients de toute la region. Nous affirmerons par la notre solidarite reelle avec la grande nation qui est notre allice, le souci constant de notre petite marine indigene et le renouveau de notre pavilion dans ces parages de la mer des Indes, oun nous fumes jadis les maitres. Je demande k la Cham- bre de voter le credit. ' This is on the records of the India Office, and I merely quote the above for ready reference, the time at our disposal being so short. Mens. Deloncle's words and their immediate result, the appointment of Mons. Ottavi, furnish a sufficient explanation of increased activity of the French from that epoch in the direction of distributing their flag, and of their object in doing so. P. Z. COX, Major t 21st March 1905. 6208 F. D.29 Note on the limits of Mashat territory, I can offer little useful information on this point. Oman is a very loose term at the present day, and is used with totally different meanings at various centres and in various connections. This is thoroughly gone into and explained in Badger's History of the Imams and Seyyids of Oman (Hakluyt Society 1871), and it is still the case at the present day. All we seem concerned with is as to what were the limits of the Sultan's normal jurisdiction at the time of the signing of the Declaration of 18132 with the French. These had not changed when Colonel Pelly wrote his Eeport No. 67 of 15th April 1863 to the Chief Secretary of the Bombay Government, At that time the northern limit of Maskat was found to ' include the Mussendom promontory, inclusive of Khoomzar and Khussab,' and the frontier between Maskat and Ras-ul-Khyma territory is near where the (maritime) plain and mountains meet at Shuam.' When Political Agent at Maskat in 1902 I was instructed to investigate on the spot the northern limits of Maskat jurisdiction and proceeded to do so. Without having previously seen Colonel Felly's Report No. 67 I arrived by independent investigation at precisely the same conclusions. These were reported in Maskat No. 290, dated 2nd July 1902, and also in the demi-official letter from myself to the Secretary to the Government of India, dated Septem ber 1903, in which I point out the identity of my conclusions with those of Colonel Pelly. There is ample evidence from 1860 onwards, in the records of the Maskat Agency, that the Pirate Coast Trucial Chiefs were not under the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Maskat but quite independent of him and within the juris diction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf and not of the Political Agent and Consul accredited to Maskat. On the South Coast Ras Sair or Saji'r is the undoubted boundary, but I have not been able to discover the original author for it. The Revd. Mr. Badger, at page iv of his introduction, aptly states that the boundaries of Oman depend in a great measure upon the personal character of the native rulers, and the success or failure of their policy towards the tur bulent outlying tribes. Thus at times, in 1839, for instance, Sohar has been declared independent; and at the present time the stretch of coast between Mureir and Diba is under Jowasmi jurisdiction. As the question of boundaries is one which will perhaps have to be decided more or less arbitrarily by Government I hesitate to say more on the subject without special research for which there has not been sufficient time and for which there is little or no local material.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo on the question of the introduction of the name of the Sultan of Muscat in the British Case, as one of the Parties in the Muscat Dhow Arbitration. Your Excellency states that the French Government take note of the promise made by me that, in the further documents to be presented by His Majesty's Government to the Tribunal, the name of His Highness will not appear as one of the Parties to the Arbitration. It is not necessary, therefore, to enter into further argument as to the grounds on which His Majesty's Government originally thought it right to insert His Highness' name. But as your Excellency has referred to what passed between us on the 25th May, 1903, in regard to the Agreement for referring the question at issue to arbitration, I think it right to observe that the passage which, at your request, was omitted from the draft of my note on the subject, provided for the reference to arbitration of any questions which the Sultan might desire to raise. It is the fact, as your Excellency states, that you objected on behalf of the French Government to accepting any demands for arbitration which the Sultan might himself put forward. But I did not, at the time, understand you to state that your Government wished to preclude the Tribunal from taking cognizance of the Sultan's views upon any questions affecting his interests which the British or French Government might desire to refer to it for settlement. His Majesty's Government will communicate your Excellency's note, with this reply, to the Tribunal, in the same manner as the previous correspondence. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE.

Canbon spoke to ne about the supposed acquisition by France of a harbour at Muscat, which had been mentioned by the English newspapers. He said that he had no instructions to speak to ne about it, but that he thought it better to ii| 1 - M I | I mention it at once to avoid any misapprehension. The only thing that had happened was that the French Government, wanting both for their ships of war, and for their commerce. T v ' I ■; Ji 1 til ) -S' rf •wMSIWWi&amp;ij Bwfl I i IB '' P'-t •* i I iiiiil I fmmm 11 # a coaling station, had leased of the Imaum of Muscat a certain site for that station. He called to mind the engage- xaent we had entered into in 1862, not to trench on the independence of the Imaum of Muscat, and reminded me also of the engagement into which Muscat had entered, in the time of Louis Philippe, to allow all Frenchmen to hold land, or receive leases or alienations of land in the territory of the Sultan. He apprehended that the action of the French Government in taking a coaling station was within their powers. I said that the matter had been in the hands of tl^e Indian Government, and I was not absolutely certain of the position in which it stood, but I would inquire. But it peiappeared to ne, upon his own statement of it, that France had ^one somewhat beyond her Treaty rights. If a State accepts the lease of the territory of another Potentate, it practically interferes with the independence of that Poten- tate and the integrity of his dominions. We have had sundry examples to illustrate that proposition recently. According to my reading of the engagement of 1862, it is not competent for Prance, as a State, to accept a }ease from the Inaum of Muscat, because, so far as that lease extends, it is an interference with the independence of the Sovereign. She can no more accept § lease than she can accept an alienation. This view, of course, would not apply to a lease given to a French citizen in his private capacity. I would , however, inquire into tho natter, which 1 did not think was of very great importance; but my impression is that a coaling station leased by the French Government from the Imaum of Iluscat, would be an infraction of the Declaration of 1862. I am, etc. # (Sd.) Salisbury.IU Canbon spoke to me this afternoon with respect % to Uuscat# He complained very earnestly of the excessive action which he thought the Admiral had pursued towards the Imaum of Muscat, and of the publicity which had been given to the affair, which induced the newspapers to adopt a very disagreeable tone towards the Trench Govern ment. As he came down he had seen the incident announced upon the hoardings by an advertisement proclaiming 'a new check for Trance.' I replied to him that. I had examined into the matter since he spoke to me last time, and I was compelled to adhere to the view which I had laid before him. It seemed to me that the Treaty of 1862, which bound both France and England to respect the independence of the Imaum of Muscat, was seriously threatened if either ?ower^ f acting as a Sovereign State, could take from the Imaum a lease of any portion of his territory. If it could be done for a small piece of ground, it could be done for a large piece, and after what had taken place in China it was impossible to00264 to say that the practical inddpeuuaucd of the Inan would not, in regard to such portions of territory, be impaired. His Excellency declined entirely to admit my interpretation of the Treaty, but setting that question aside, he thought that our view on that subject, which was certainly open to discussion, need not havo been c asserted by a threat of bombardment. I maintained and I reiterated the opinion, in order that he might be under no doubt with respect to it, that Trance had so far violated the Treaty by taking a lease of a portion of the territory of the Imaum. I vjuite admitLed that the affair had not been conducted as quiet Ly as I think it well might have been, and I said that I was yery sorry that it had publicly taken the form of an apparent controversy with Prance, I ad mit Led tnat in the matter of sentiment he had a grievance, though in the matter of substance our action was entirely right. I also told him that we had had for a great number of years special engagements with the Imaum which involved some payments of money on our side, and a very ri^id prohibition of the alienation of his own territory on his siae. 1 :e existence of these stipulations must be taken into account if the action o^our authorities had seemed to be rather summary, and they had undoubtedly been actuatedC^65 actuated by the fear lest the lease which Prance obtained should only be ai step on the road to the obtain ing af a portion of the Inaum's littoral in permanent possession. His Sxcellency assured no that any such designs were very far from the contemplation of his Government and he was quite willing to make any declaration which was necessary to place the innocent intentions of his Govern- ment beyond doubt. But he asked me whether it would not be possible, after such declarations had been made, to provide in some manner for the establishment of a coaling station, which was really a matter of great necessity to Prance. He said that a suggestion which I had made on a previous occasion, and repeated again, that it might be taken in the name of a French citizen, was made, difficult on the present occasion, because the English newspapers had appeared to dictate such a course in a somewhat threat ening manner, and he thought that the same end might be arrived at if France formally disclaimed any inference, from her possession of a coal depot, which could be construed to be derogatory to the independence of the Imaum, or to establish any French right to the littoral. I said that I was not capable of answering the question directly, bQt§,c)use the natter was entirely within00266 within the jurisdiction of the India Office, but I would convey his wishes to the Indian Government, and when I knew their answer I would report it to him.0-^267 FOREIGN DEPARTMENT NOTES. &gt; —&gt;. LIMITS OF THE SULTANATE OF MASKAT. V % 1. I have been asked for an opinion as to the limits o£ the Sultan of Maskat's territory and as to the desirability of defining them by means of a map. 2. As the Maskat frontier has not been formally demarcated on any side, I can do no more than adduce reasons for considering that certain places are within and others without the Sultan's jurisdiction. 3. In regard to each doubtful locality we must enquire, firstly, whether the Sultan claims the sovereignty; secondly, whether the actual inhabitants admit it; and, thirdly, whether any neighbouring authority maintains a rival claim. The best proof of sovereign rights is, if course, their exercise, as by dispensing justice or collecting taxes. 4. The French view * seems to be that the Sultanate of Maskat extends from the Peninsula « Con ik nf fii • «iu' • » kt- •&gt;. j ^ atar i 11 ^be north to the western extremity * See page 15 of their ' Memoire.'

At the our * same time it is indicated that there is a doubt J Page 15. regarding his title to one place, namely, Sur.f Gwadur J is mentioned as belonging to the Sultan, and a vague hint thrown out that part of the Persian coast and certain Persian islands § Page 15. are his also§. 5. Gwadur incontestably pertains to Maskat and need not be referred to again. 6 The Foreign Office can hardly desire any remarks from me regarding the French claim on behalf of the Sultan to the whole territory of.the Trucial Chiefs and to the portions of Persia mentioned above. The means of combating it are historical, not geographical. Geographically the claim is an absurdity. 7. The question is thus narrowed down to one of the continuity of the Sultan's possessions II See his letter No. 290 of 2nd July 1902, para- betwee11 the boundary of Shatga—which I graph 12 (Pros. Sec.

The case for the independence of Sur is a weak one, unless we ourselves strengthen it by creating an unfortunate analogy^ The French admit there is a Wali at Sur and my inquiries snow that the Sultan maintains two forts and four smaller posts there, namely, Hisn As Saiyid (60 men), Sanaisala (30 men), 'Is (10 men), Jinah ( 5 men), Sakaikaru (10 men) and Sbamih (10 men). Major Grey has promised me an estimate of the Sultan's revenues, which will no doubt show what he derives from Sur; meanwhile I am able to state that in 1895 and 1896 the Sultan collected a special export tax at Sur which ft The Sultan could no doubt produce namerous other } ielded b650. tbis was an undeniable act of ioBtances, both old aud recent. ^oveiei^nty.'f'T lii6 rrcnch assertion that u tho tribes of Sur have never ceased to proclaim their independence of the ruler of Oman ' is unintelligible to us unless it refers to certa n tribes of the inland Sharkiya province, whose port is Sur and who have been in a chronic state of rebellion for years. But how can the behaviour of these inaccessible tribes affect the political status of Sur ? There have, it is true, leen partial rebellions and a good deal of insubordination at Sur in recent years. 9. The claim of the Shaikh of Sharga to the strip between Diba and Khor Kalba was fully considered before being admitted by us. Less than a month ago, in a crowded assembly[ 2 ] at Sohar which included the Sultan's acting Wali of that place, I asked which villages belonged to Sharga. The reply was given, without a dissenting voice, that all the coast Mrr . ,, . c ,. villages from Khor Kalba to Diba, inclusive, » There is no need to notice the dispute between Sharga V1J id- ^ mi. and Fujaira. Fujaira at the inost is a mere enclave, were under ^harga. I here seems no reason Sharga coining down to the coast on both north and to recede from our decision about this strip of south of it. coast, especially as we find that in 1886 the Sultan of Maskat abstained from an attempt to annex Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Diba, the Resident having counselled him against it. The French might ascribe his not pressing his claim to fear of us, but they cannot get over the facts that Sharga has held posseJsion for 50 years, and is generally regarded as the owner. 10. In regard to the coast between Tibat (Tibba) and Diba, exclusive of the latter, I have several new facts to bring forward. Let us apply the threefold test suggested in para graph 3 above. (a) In 1864, Colonel Disbrowe, Agent at Maekat, invited Thowaini, the Sultan of the day, to state ,e for the purposes of official record ' whether the Isthmus of Maklab and the villages of Habalain and Mukaka belonged to him or not. The Sultan replied 'They are all my country and my dependants; no one has any concern with them/' In 1902 Major Cox reported that ' the Sultan would doubtless, if asked the direct question, claim jurisdiction over the Maklab Isthmus, and the Has Mosandim promontory/' In other words, it is clear that Maskat claims the district. (b) In 1902 Major Cox reported that the Shaikh of Lima in the abstract recognised his subordination to Saiyid Faisal and said that Saiyid Faisal's wishes were law to him. The Dhahuriyin (Zahooriyeen) of the Malcolm Inlet seemed to recognise the Sultan of Maskat in a patriarchal way and said that if any momentous dispute arose amongst them they would appeal to him. The people of Kumzar unequivocally and unhesitatingly acknowledged the sovereignty of the bultan of Maskat, not over themselves only but over the whole Shihhi tribe, with the exception of a few subject to Ras A1 Rhaima, The Shihhiylo of the villages betwe n Elphinstone Inlet and the Ras A1 Khaima frontier expressed friendly and loval sentiments towards the Sultan of Maskat, and their shaikh was in the habit of paying complimentary visits to Saiyid Faisal at Maskat. I have intentionally omitted statements and facts which in Major Cux's opinion detracted from the value of these admissions ; but do not these admissions prove, whatever may be adduced on the other side, that these Shihhiyin, rightly or wrongly, regard themselves as Maskat subjects ? (c) I am able to add the opinion of the people of Sharga. It was the Jawasim Chief who was supposed in 1864 f Major Cox told me recently, in conversation to have a competing claim to the that, even now-a-days, bharga could not be suspected a. t lu of any bias in favour of Matkat. Maklab Isthmus.t I held a gathering at Sharga a tew days . ago in the honse of the British Agent, at which the Chief himself, the British Agent, an intelligent Shihhi and various other knowledgable men were present. The meeting unanimously stated that the places between their own frontier at Sha'am (ShuamJ and Diba belonged to Maskat, and several they mentioned by name as belonging to Maskat, among them Khasab, Kumzar and Shisa. I am obliged to contest Major Cox's statement + that the Waliship of Khasab is an insti tution of only 13 (now 16) years'standing. X Paragraph 11 of his letter No. 290 of 2nd July We find on the contrary that there was already 1902. Pros.

This evidence in favour of the Maskat claim is by no means despicable. We shall be placed in an unfortunate position if, while posing as the Sultan's friend and representative before the Hague Tribunal, we deny his claim to this territory which the French arc apparently rea'iy to admit. Again, if we say that the presence of a Wali on the part of the Sultan al Khasab proves nothing, we shall make it mucli easier for the French to contend that Sur also is independent. ' 12. The Sultan's only inland posts, so far as I have been able to ascertain, are these :— In the province of Lhuhira. —'Araki, in the Wadi Kablr, which runs (rom the summit of the Hajar bills towards Ibri. 'Aiaki is said to lie at a distance of 14 hours onfoot from the watershed, upon the side further from the sea. The Sultan has a Wali here. In the Hajar hills behind the —Haiyadh, in V\ adi Haiti, at a distance of 13 hours on foot from the sea. There is a post and revenue is collected, Bnruj Ash Shijairi, in Wadi Jizi at a distance of perhaps 9 hours on foot from the sea. 'Awabi, about 11 hours on foot from the sea, in Wadi Beui Kharua. Nakhl, about six hours from the sea, in 'Wadi Hammam, a tributary of Wadi Ma'awal. All these places are on the seaward slopes of the Hajar range. Nakhl is the only one of them which possesses a Wali. In the Samdyil —Bidbid and Samayil situated respectively 11 and 20 hours on foot from the sea. These have no Wali at present. In the province of 'Ot/idn Proper. —Izki or Ziki, one hour's ride on the further side from the sea of the watershed at which Wadi Samayil rises. Nizwa, about 23 miles west of Izki. Manah, about 15 miles south-south-east of Nizwa. Thpse three lie in the elevated central basin or ' jauf' of ; Oman; Izki and Nizwa have each a Wali, but Manah has none. 13. It is impossible to say how far the Sultan's authority or influence radiates from these inland posts. In any case we must note that the whole valley of Rostak, also called Wadi Fara', from Hazam inclusive upwards, comprising about 30 villages, is in possession of the Sultan's relation Saiyid Sa'id bin Ibrahim bin Kais bin ' Azzan. ^he Sultan has married his sister and pays him a subsidy, but the Saiyid is practically independent. Again the Sultan has no posts ia jthe inland province of feharkiya, and it is entirely beyond his control. It is doubtful whether any number of the inhabitants of Sharkiya own even a nominal allegiance to Mask at. 14. If I may offer an opinion on such a point, the French have no right to raise the general question of the Sultan's boundaries on the present reference. It is open to tl em to prove, if they can, that Sur, where most of their flags are held, is outside the Sultan's dominions. If, however, the British representative is required to state what the British Government consider to be the Sultanas limits, he might accompany his statement with a rough map like that attached, the names of the Saltan's inland posts being omitted.

To His Exoellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. M y L ord, With reference to my telegram of the 30tli December last, I n have to inform your Excellency hoisUn^Ihe BriAM Flag'Tc^e tl,at . tl,e question of hoisting the Musandim, fyc. British fla^ at Cape Musandim has been fully considered in all its bearings by His Majesty's Government. 2. The object which the Government of India desire to attain, as stated in their Secret letters in the Foreign Department of the 23rd October 1902, No. 192, and the 21st January 1904. No. 16, is to prevent any Foreign Power establishing a commanding position at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty's Government are in entire agree ment with your Excellency as to the necessity of preventing any such action on the part of a Foreign Power, the first result of which would be to entail an increase of naval expenditure and a re-arrangement of our naval dispositions. It only remains, therefore, to consider the best means of securing this object. 3. The method which the Government of India have desired to adopt, viz., to hoist the British flag at certain points in the immediate vicinity of Cape Musandim, is open to the objection that it would not confer upon us any special rights in the places selected, unless it were accom panied by a specific proclamation of protectorate or annexation. On the other hand, an open assertion ol our claims to these places might excite the jealousy of other Powers, and give rise to political complications. 4. The alternative method would be to make it clear that His Majesty's Government would not tolerate the occupation by any Foreign Power of any port or territory in the Persian Gulf. It will be within your Excellency's recollection that on the 5th May 1903 Lord Lansdowne stated in the House of Lords that ' we should regard the ' establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian ' Gulf by any other Power as a very great menace to British interests, ' and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.' S. 6. India Office, London, 19th May 1905.To tliis declaration His Majesty's Government adhere, and it is their intention to relv upon it tor the protection of their interests. 5. These considerations have led His Majesty's Government, as I stated in my telegram ot the 31st March Inst, to modify the orders contained in my telegram of the 4th August 1904. They arrived at the conclusion that the flagstafl's on Sheep Island and the isthmus between Malcolm and Klphinstone inlets should he abandoned, and that it would be sufficient for the purposes of the policy laid down in the preceding paragraph to maintain the flagstaff upon Telegraph Island as a sign of the continuance of our occupation of that spot which first took place in connection with the operations of the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1869. 0. The opinion of His Majesty's Gaverument with regard to the flagstaff on Telegraph Island was based on the conclusion, formulated in the Secret Letter from your Excellency's Government, No. 192, of the 23rd October 1902, that the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Muscat over the Makhlab Isthmus and Musandim Promontory was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would be open to His Majesty's Government to ignore it. 7. The posirion has, however, been materially altered by Mr. Lorimer's enquiries, the result of which is reported in his note of the 22nd March last; and I gather from your Excellency's telegrams of the 27th March and loth April last that the Government of India are no longer prepared to ignore the fact of the Sultan's sovereignty over Musandim. 8. In the changed circumstances, having regard to the considerations stated above (paragraph 3), and in view of the grounds upon which Her late Majesty's Government protested to the French Government against the cession to them by the u/and 0 S Sul ^ Gisseh in 1898/ February 1899.

In the meantime nothing should be done in anticipation of the linal decision of His Majesty's Government. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant.

ON the receipt of your Lordship's telegram No. 58 of the I5tli instant, respecting the nomination by the King of Italy of Dr. Lammasch to act as Umpire in the Muscat Arbitration Commission, I inquired of the French Ambassador whether he had heard anything of the appointment. His Excellency said that he had no information on the subject, and I then told him I proposed to make inquiries at the ' Ballplatz, ' and would let him know the result. At the Ministry Herr von Miiller informed me that the Italian Ambassador had a few days before made unofficial inquiries if the Austro-Hungarian Government would object to Dr. Lammasch's nomination, and had been answered in the negative. On the 14th they had received an official note from his Excellency stating that the King of Italy proposed to appoint Dr. Lammasch, which they considered did not require an answer in view of what had been done unofficially, and closed the incident as far as they were concerned. Herr von Miiller added that Dr. Lammasch, who is a Life Member of the Upper House, was a very distinguished man, an authority on international law, and had been one of the Austrian Delegates to The Hague Peace Conference. He speaks both French and English fluently. I then called on the Italian Ambassador, who explained to me that ! &gt;r. Lammasch had unofficially accepted the post of Umpire, but had not yet notified his consent in writing. His Excellency said he expected an official answer from Count Goluchowski to his notification of Dr. Lammasch's appointment, and seemed surprised when I told him I understood the Ministry did not think it required an answer. These details of routine, to which the Duke of Avarna attaches some importance, have probably delayed the official notification of Dr. Lammasch's appointment. I subsequently informed the French Ambassador of what I had learnt at the ' Ballplatz ' and from his Italian colleague, and M. de Reverseaux told me he should write on the subject to M.

An incident has ,1ust» ooourred here which is of inherest» in t »haT. It# seepis t»o show t,hat. we oannot» yet» relax tihe s lo precautions which have been taken in past years for the preven tion of slave trading. On the Rth Instant Captain Baker-Jaker of H, S. 'Terpsichore 0 the Senior Waval Officer of this atation told me confidentially that he had received reliable information that a dhow called the 'J^ath-el-Kelr' sailing under French colours which had arrived here from Sur in the Persian ^ulf on the ? K 2nt Ultimo intended leaving the harbour the following evening, she Jbi * Q0 hySXl vTJJCl flOfl© eiiti \ ' i OvJ - ( was then to ejichor off a place called Bu-bu-bu about seven miles north of the port at which place the 'Nakoda' or Captain had n. « tj-j « ru^v'J ar. = U ©xi*' .e . 1 previously arranged with some of the natives that he would cg&amp;il and take on board their cocoaniStts so enabling them to evade the payment of duty; by holding out this inducement he hoped t»o get about 25 of them on ooard when it was his intention to con fine them below deck and set sail on his return voyage to Sur vnhere it is commonly reported that slaves still fetch from 100 to 200 dollars i.e. £.12 to £.24 a piece. Captain Baker-Baker's difficulty lay in the fact that he could not board a dhow flying the ^ench .^lag without dis- charginc Ms Instructions from the Admiralty and after consi der wi,ti on Yfe aecided that although the wisdom of the course was doubtfu 1 yet It seemed to be the only plan to take the ''rench Consul, with whom our relations have lately oeen of a very iriendly nature, into our confidence and to obtain his consent to »he boardini of the vess^?. i therefore saw L onsieur Ottavi r WhO The I cirquess of Lansdowne K. ft., etc., etc., etc,,00290 he was a suoject; of r^he SiOtran, wh«n asked how it, was trhat.'he had been sailing under l^ench colours he said t»hat, his father also a native of Batana and a Sultan's subject, who had owned t ,he dhow before hlia had been Jn t,he hatolt, of tiradlng between the Persian ^u3f» Zanzibar, Comoro and 1 adagascar and that# having narried a oomoro womotn he was there given French protection and a license to f3y the ^lag: on the death of his father two or three years ago he had oeen allowed to retain the license although he was not even a son oy the Oomoro woman. » 'T'hls appears to be a striking Instance of the dis regard of the Brussels Act which the French authorities have been in the habit of showing in the issue of their ^ag to persons who had no claim to it and there can be little douot that ooth the father of All bin Salim /ateib who was I am Informed a well known slave trader as well as All himself used the I^lag thus acquired simply as a protection from the inter ference of British I an-of-far. Mr. Rogers has decided to withold the grant of a provisional license until the inquiries which he has instituted are completed. It is of course much to be regretted that we were unable to effect the capture of the dhow and make an example of the Nakoda and crew but it may be hoped that their detention here will help to dispel the idea which I hear that the Persian Oulf Araos seem to hold, that we are no longer on the quivive and that they can therefore revive their old and nefarious ways with impunity. It is of course unportable that many slaves are now a days shipped away from these Islands out as J had the honour to report to Your Lordship in my despatch No.^1 of April 88th of last year, it is believed that a certain trade is still done oetween t^he Northern ooast of Portuguese -ast Africa and the Persian Oulf and the case of kidnapping at Pemba to which the above Quoted despatch referred shows that the presence of a Man-of-Var is still desiraole in these waters especially during the first 4 or 5 months i.e. from April r o August when the wind0^300 COPY.

Kindly refer to Zanzibar despatch 'o: oP of May 11th, to r our Lordship's address which has today reached me. The identity of the Captain of the Dhow with the case dealt with in (British Case, Appendix 34' was X trust, realised by our Representative, and will oe taken cogni sance of by the Tribunal now sitting at the Hague.(M*305 BUSHXRLJ# 30- Tuly l o 05. Lly dear Prater, Please refer ' go drey's recent letters No: 333 and 369 to your address in connect ion with the ilusoat Flag Case. His letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs mentioned in paragraph 2 of the latter, and drawing attention to Ali 'bin Xalim 1 s iden tity, was only despatched from Jv!uscat by the mail of 19th July, and on receipt of his No: 369 I thought that in any case nothing would be lost by My despatching to the.Por- eign Office London the teleprajn of which I a i. a copy 5 for your inforrn.ation. ^ The details of the ca^se before the Hague Tribunal are so familiar to ne that I find it difficult to realise how far they are likely to be so to others, and aia exercised, perhaps needlessly, as to whether on receipt of Grey's letters it occurred to the Foreign Department what a great chance had been vouchsafed to us and 'to what a very partial extent it had been made use of. Just think how greatly the French case would have been damaged if we had captured the 'Path-el-Kheir, |$ued ( proprietor Ali bin Salimlwaladl Taheb, one of the actual items S. I. Fraser Esquire, 0.1.1*]. , S I M L A.items on the French list (himself Ho: 17 and his dead father No: 27 in their first list) redhanded in the kid napping of slaves during the actual progress of the oase. This vras the very individual whose name was brought so prominently formrd in tiie original British Statement. On page 21 thereof a precis of the oase was given, in which the Dhow's name, ,l Pateh-el-^aleir , •, its transfer to Ali bin Sal in* 91 oued 1 Taheb' on the death of the fatiier Salim bin ilahomed 'oued Taheb** its wreck at Debai; tiae acquirement of a substitute and the hoisting of the French J lag over it; were all clearly recorded# In appendix 34 the correspondence was given in full, and in my letter of 21st ilay 1904, it was stated that the Arab belonged to the Batineh Coast of Or ^ ^ 3^-,) The Zanzibar authorities must surely have received all the papers of the case for the Tribunal, for Zanzibar is almost as closely identified with the French Flag ques tion as . luscat. YOien the Captain of the ,, Terpsichore ,, reported the matter to His Britannic Majesty 's Consul giving the cor rect name of the Dhow, would it not have been reasonable for the latter considering that the whole Flag question vras sub Judica to have got the 'Terpsichore''s Interpre ter to ascertain what the master 's name was- might jie not then have been expected to refer to the list of Dhow-owners whom the French claim to protect? If lie had done so, even cursorily, he could hardly have failed to identify the it .an. Even when he afterwards took Ali bin Salim's state ment and ascertained his name and the fact that he hailed from the • iatineh Coast, it never seemed to occur to him to attempt to identify the man with any item in the French list. Taan again was it reasonable or necessary for him. to confide t * I00307 | confide in Monsieur Ottavi at such, an early stage? The one nan of all others who has been specially identified with the PrencJl Flag movement for 10 years past and whose his tory and character should be well knorm to any Political Officer at Zanzibar, Would it not have been Just as easy for him 'bo have informed the French Consul after the D&amp;ow load got under Tray? Moreover I cannot think that Ilr: Sinclair's observa tion that the Captain of the ,!, Terpsic]uore M could not visit a French Flag Dhow without tkmtravenin^ his instructions from the Admiralty is entirely accurate. If he has ade quate prima facie evidence that a DhOTT carries slaves and has the support of Ms Consul, the Comr ander of a man-of-war runs little or no professional risk in visiting any native craft flying the French Flag. It j '.as been done in these •raters - for instance in the cases mentioned in appendix 8 of our Counter Ca.se. It is possible that the Foreign Office or the Officer in charge of our case on receipt of the Zanzibar despatch of 11 tlx I lay, may have identified the ran in time to use the incident to some advantage in our final rejoinder, but unless he knew Arabic and could at once understand the orthographical discrepancy between the synonymous cogno- X Oued Taheb 1 mens X Wad Taheb 1 ^ is more than possible that he may X Walad Taheb X X Wateib X not liave done so. If I seem to be a querulous or captious critic in making these observations, I beg 'Ghat allovrance may be made for me. I have had during the last 5 years or more many hours of vrork and worry over this Flag question, and if the case does not end , as vre hope it will, I shall not only be much disappointed personally, but fear that I shall have to take a share of the odium which is apt to attach to participators in any unsuccessful enterprise; I cannot therefore help feeling a little mortified at the way in whichooaoH wiiioil w© seen to liava lost a good deal of the advajitage of the great jiiQijililliiii vjhlch came in our way, owing to causes which as far as one can read betr/een the lines might have been for the most part avoided. It is not in ray province to offer official criticism upon the action of members of a, sister service as it ap pears from correspondence in which I have Imd no direct share, but if the cireurostances present themselves to you at all as they have to me, perhaps an opportunity could be found, before the decision of the Tribunal is promulgated, to mention to His Majesty's Foreign Office, that as far as can be judged from the information and correspondence available, this Zanzibar incident might have been made more of^ , I have addressed this to you derai-officially, beca -use I cannot be sure whether my fears, as regards the identification of the Dhow owner by the Officer in charge of our case in London, will prove warranted, nor arn 1 in a position to ascertain this before the date quoted for t -he deliver of the Tribunal's decision, alter .Thich, it would not be possible to say anybhing.

My Lord:- An incident has Just OGoicrred here which is of interest in that it seems to shout that ive cannot relax the precautions which have teen taken in past years for the prevention of slave trading. On the 5th instant Captain Baker Baker of H.M.S. 'Terpsichore' the Senior Naval Officer of this station told me confidentially that he had received reliable information that a dhow called the *Fath~el-kair' sailing under French colours which had arrived here from Sur in the Persian Gulf on the 22nd ultimo intended leaving the harbour the following evening, she vias then to anchor off a plaoe called Bu-bu-'bu about seven miles north of the port at which place the 'Kakoda' or Captain had previously arranged with some of the natives that he would call and take on board their cocoanuts so enabling them to evade the payment of duty; by holding out this inducement he hoped to get about 25 of them on board when it was his intention to confine them below deck and set sail on his return voyage to Sur where it is comronly reported that slaves still fetch from 100 to 200 dollars, that is about 12 to 24 poiTids apiece. Captain Baker Baker's difficulty lay in the fact that he could not board a dhow flying the French flag without disobeying his instructions from the. Admiralty and afterimzi after oonsideration we decided that, although the wisdom of the oourse was doult ful, yet it seemed to be the only plan to tahe the French Consul, with whom our relations have lately been of a very friendly nature, into my oonfidenoe and to obtain his consent to the boarding of the vessel. I therefore saw H. Ottavi who readily promised his co-operation and gave his consent to the steps Captain Baker Baker proposed to take for the capture of the dhow in the event of her attempting to embark any natives after leaving the port. It is clear however that on further consideration the disgrace which would have fallen on his GOuntry *s flag if the dhow had been captured in the act of slaving must have outweighed in If. Ottavi 's mind that of breaking his personal pledge of secrecy to me, for, on the follovrlng morning. Captain Baker Baker's interpreter who was in touch wi.th one of the crew ofths 'Fath-el-Keir* told him that the French Consul had sent an employ6 of his Consulate to warn the Nakoda that he was being watched and that the Nakoda had consequently decided to postpone his departure for two days. The same daxj I received a letter from II. Ottaoi stating that he had discovered some irregularities in the dhow 9 s papers which gave him the poioer of refusing to renew her license to fly the French flag but that he had not then decided what aotion to take. Unfortunately that morning, i.e. the 6th instant. Captain Baker Baker received a telegram from the Admiralty directing him to proceed at once to Durban and he was therefore compelled to place the matter in ny hands, but left his native interpreter behind so as to Keep me supplied with information.OC325J /fr, Rogers whom 1 then oonsulted, at onoe made arrangements to have the dhow followed in case she shipped off in the night and on the following day IL Ottavi again urote say that he had decided to refuse the renewal of the right to fly French go lours to the Nahoda thereby j ore inn him to apply for a Sultan's flag at the Port Office. It was now fairly evident that we must give up hone of catching the slavers red-handed as there could be no doubt that they w&amp;re aware that they were objects of suspicion, ant. I therefore decided that, when the Kahoda applied for his new papers, it might be as well to examine /iim. This I accordingly did. His name is Ali bin Salim Woiteib and he stated that he was a native of Batjna which 7 , I wia3rn ; -and, (Vi outlying part of Muscat and that he vac a sunject oj the Sultan of Oman, When ashed hoio it was that he had been sailing under French colours, he said that his father, also a native of Batpa and a Sultan's subject, who had ownecv the dhow before him, had been in the habit of trading between the Persian Gulf , Zanzibar, and Comoro, Madagascar, and that having matried a Comoro vxoman, he was theregiven French protection and a license to fly vhe jlag. On the death of his father tivo or three years ago he had been allowed to retain the license although he was not even a son by the Comoro woman. This appears to be a striding instance of titoe disregard of the Brussels Act which the French authorities have been in the habit of showing in the- issue of their flag to persons who had no claim to it and there can be little doubt that both the father of Ali bin Salim Wateib who was, I am informed, a well Known slave trader, as w&amp;LLl as Ali himself used the flag thus acquired simply as a protection from the interference of BritisJi men-of-war.Mr. Eogevs has deoidsd to withhold the grwt 0; ci provisional lioense until the inquiries whioh he has instituted are completed. It is of ooirrse muoh to loe re gretted that we were unahle to effect the capture of the dhow and make an example of the Nahoda and orew hut it may be hoped that their detention hare wil help to dispel the idea, which I hear that the Persian Gulf Arahs seen to hold, thatrwe are no longer on the 'qui vive' and that they cor. therefore revive their old and nefarious ways with iirtpmity. It is of course improbable that many slaves are now-a-days shipped away from these islands, but as I had the honour to report to Your Lordship in my despatch No.31 of April 20 of last year, it is believed that a certain trade is still done between the Northern Coast of Portuguese East Africa and the Persian Gulf and the case of Kidnapping at Pemba, to whioh the above quoted despatch referred, shows that the presence of a man-of-war is still desirable in these waters especially during the first four or five months, that is from April to August, that the wind blows from the south—west•3z^ Enclosure in P.O. covering letter of June 16, 190o Decypher Mr Cave , Zanzibar, June 14, 1905.
