BENGAL INFANTRY. •A''-' ' f I calcutta: printed by the superintendent of government printing, india. 1890.(D REPORT OF A JOURNEY THROUGH PERSIA. Part I. Section i.—Linga to Bastak. December 13th, 1S87. —Arrived at Linga, a small seaport situated 1887. on the northern coast of the Persian Gulf. Linga is a long strip of a Llnga ' town running along the very edge of the sea ; it is about 15 miles long and ^ of a mile in breadth, and is situated on low-lying ground. To the north of it the country rises in a succession of gravelly undulations commencing from its outskirts. These gravelly hills are strewn with lumps of stone which are composed of numberless marine fossils. In some few places there are layers of rock, but there is a complete ab sence of grass or any other vegetation. Sand grouse abound. Consists of about 8,000 people, the majority of whom are Arabs and Population, negroes. There are also a few Hindu banias and agents of Indian firms residing here. All the houses are built of sun-dried bricks. Public Bund- There is an English post office looked after by a babu. The Governor lives in a fortified enclosure built on the water's edge. The bazar is small and well stocked with provisions. Almost entirely asses. Transport. Consists of wells and bourkahs (large-domed tanks), many of which water-supply, are now dry, as no rain has fallen for more than two years. There are thirty-three bourkahs and numerous wells besides. The harbour is much exposed to easterly winds, when large ships can only unload with great difficulty. The British India Steam Navi gation Company's ships cannot approach nearer than 1 mile to the shore, at which distance their cargo is transferred to and landed by means of boats. The shore west of the town is low and would be favourable for a landing from boats, while the town itself is completely commanded by the rising ground to the north of it. Imports go from here to Yezd, Kirman, Sistan and Herat. Import Trade, duties have been levied since 1866, but not export duties.2 Report of a Journey through Persia. There is an English Political Agent, an influential Arab merchant, who looks after British subjects, shipping. Native boats are built up to 300 tons. There are 35 boats of this tonnage, 20 smaller ones, and about 60 fishing craft, of various sizes. December ijth. —Weather fine. Leave Linga at g A. M. Road runs over open ground; soil gravel. At | miles it enters a broad, dry nullah with 30 foot perpendicular banks. At 2 miles pass 2 bour- kahs on the left of the road, both filled by the rain which fell heavily on the 15th, then over a little clayey ground for 200 yards, and at 3 miles pass between two low hills on to hard, open, sandy ground, dotted with low table-shaped hillocks. At 4 miles pass 3 bourkahs 500 yards to left of road. At 4I miles pass through a narrow opening in small hills on to a hard open plain. At 5^ miles commence a descent down a gentle incline over hard gravelly soil, open ground for 1 mile to both flanks. At 6| miles pass some huts and clusters of date trees. Road then passes over an open plain. Marshy ground to the left as far as the eye can see. The ground on either side of the road is covered with small prickly bushes, while to the right there are clusters of date trees at intervals and one or two huts. At miles halt at a small house i ^ au Gaiumi. amongst date trees, called Ali Galumi. Temperature 65. 0 Time 3^ hours 4 ' Road good and passable to all arms. Supplies none. Water good from a well. December 18th. —Weather fine. Temperature 58°. Leave halting place at 7 A .M. and march over low slippery ground, which is evidently subject to inundation. F'ace about 2 miles an hour This ground can, however, be avoided by making a detour round to the right, which would lengthen the road by about i| miles. The soil now is sand covered with a surface coat of inch clay. A few shrubs about. At 3 miles leave the swampy tract, which is said to be dry in the hot weather, and pass over a gravel soil amongst clumps of date trees and wheat fields. At 3I miles pass a small well, about 10 feet deep, on left of road. At 4 miles pass two more wells on left. People are visible plough ing the ground in all directions, and bullocks are seen drawing water. At 6 miles enter the village of Meirakum. At 9-45 temperature 63°. Population 200. Supplies wheat and firewood in small quanities. Water from wells, about 60 feet deep, is abundant; there are at least 12 in the immediate vicinity. Several of the people living here have formerly resided in Bombay, and have therefore learnt to appreciate the bless ings of English rule. After a two hours' halt leave Meirakum, and at 6^ miles pass a few huts and 3 wells on the right of the road. At 7 miles pass four wells and a vegetable garden ; trees and cultivation all round; then crossashallow water-course with gravel bed and soft 3-foot banks. Then over an open uncultivated plain with a few trees and bushes scattered about. At 7I miles pass two bourkahs. At 9I miles the villages of ChampehReport of a Journey through Persia. 3 fifchant, and Derakun are visible. At 10 miles pass the small caravanserai of Dui Dun on the ri^ht of the road as well as 2 dry tanks, and descend s of this gently over open ground. At Ha miles cross ground broken up by iis sizes. water-courses. 1. Road At 12 miles enter the village of Champeh and halt. Time 5 hours. 1 broad, Road good and passable to all arms. This is a small village contain- 2bour- ing about 70 people. There are numerous date tree plantations about, ivilyon Water from bourkahs. Supplies but little procurable.

December 21st. —Leave halting ground at 8-45 a.m. Temperature 64°. Weather fine. Road along on the left bank of a ravine. On the right a few trees, 8' diameter, about, and prickly bushes. On the left of the road a ridge of perpendicular upheaved strata runs for a mile or more like a wall. At miles, the road descends, and runs in and out among nullahs and stony hillocks. A peculiar fea ture of all Persian roads appertains to this one, namely, that those parts of it which are naturally good have been improved, while the worse parts have been left to themselves. At 2^ miles pass a small caravanserai and bourkah. A few trees about, fit for camel grazing and firewood only. The track now becomes broad, hard and stony. At 3 miles an ascent commences by a rocky pathway up a ravine. Pace very slow. A little Indian grass about and occasional trees. At 54 miles reach the summit of a range of low mountains, and pass between two peaks, about 400 feet above the road. Gradient of ascent, +8°. Elevation about 1,850 feet. Road now descends (gradient 3 0 ) gently by a winding stony track, and at 6 miles arrives at Char Bourkah, where there is a small caravanserai, three ruined bour- kahs, and one which is full of water and in good repair. Road stony, still descends running over and amongst little hills. At 8| miles it enters the bed of a nullah amongst Indian grass and prickly trees. Road smooth and gravelly. Hills near covered with tufts of grass and small cactus. At g\ miles down by a very steep descent gradi ent 23 0 into a deep ravine with perpendicular cliffs and a sandy but hard bottom. At gf miles the ravine becomes more extended, and the surrounding hills less lofty, then up and down amongst crags. At loi miles a steep descent by a narrow path, about 3 feet wide. In 4 minutes reach the bottom, and proceed along another ravine. Per pendicular cliffs on either side as the road runs along its bed, which is 50 yards wide, and gravelly but firm. At io| miles turn to the left. A road to the right along a ravine runs to Bandar Abbas from Bastak, with stages as follows, which are given by a muleteer :—• Farsakhs.

Two ridges are crossed on this route. Road now along a ravine through which runs a salt-water stream the banks of which resemble partially-thawed snow, j to inches thick. At iij miles reach the bed of the river Maheyrun flowing east; water, salt; river jbed, 600 yards wide. Water from 15 to 40 yards wide. The bank on the south side at this point slopes gently down to the water. The further bank is perpendicular and 30 feet high, being composed of a mass of boulders of all sizes. Road now along the right bank of the river until the 12th mile, when it crosses the river at the head of a pool. Water 20 inches deep, flowing slowly. Ascend out over a steep gravel bank, and at 12} miles halt s.^Maheyrun. at the caravans erai of Maheyrun. Time 5 hours 40 minutes. Road impassable for field guns or bodies of cavalry. (Water from a bourkah.) Supplies, none. Camping ground stony but spacious. The river here is said to flow from Jamareen to Bander-I-Khamir and then into the sea. Latitude 27 0 3' 13'.

Road over a stony plain ; at ^ mile turns to the left down a dry nullah and, then skirts the right bank of the river for a short dis tance. A few date and pomegranate trees about. .At 1 mile it crosses a broad stony dry stream bed. It then runs over a level plain cover ed with large stones, and at miles passes a small bourkah full of good water. At 24 miles it passes 2 wells and 1 bourkah on the left, a few plantations of date trees here ; then on amongst date trees 6. Khukhird. and cultivation to the village of Kukhird where I halt. Distance 4I 59*- m iies. Road good and passable to all arms. Time hours. A small village with about 200 inhabitants. A few fields about sown for barley, probably just sufficient for the requirements of the inhabit ants. Water plentiful from a kanat and from numerous wells, about 20 feet deep in a gravel soil. Supplies, little or none. December 24th. Weather fine. Temperature, 47 0 at 5-45 a m Leave Kukhird at 5-45 a.m. by a level road which at \ mile passes a tomb on the right. Barley fields on the left and groves of date trees Road stony. At 2\ miles pass through the small village of Harang of about 30 houses. Barley just coming up here. Pomegranate trees about- Twelve wells are visible to the left of the road being worked. Road now over a plain covered with scanty tufts of grass. At 3I miles cross a stony nullah when the road commences to ascend gently. At 44 miles it crosses a nullah withsteepbanksformed of gravel and bould ers. At 5* miles a road branches off to the left rear to the town of Jena which is now visible. Close by is a small caravan serai and two bourkahs. At 54 miles the road winding round the foot of a rocky range of hills on the left proceeds up a valley and, becoming veryRppvrt of a Journey through Persia. 7 stony and uneven, runs over some small nullahs. At 6| miles it cross es two deep nullahs in succession (requiring cutting, and gradients easing for guns). Soil hard ; then ascends by a winding rocky path way, impassable to guns. Over a saddle between two hill ranges, then across it, and at 7I miles descend towards Bastak, which is now visi ble by a steep and rocky pathway impassable to guns and cut in the hill side. Then over a level plain until the town of Bastak is reached. Distance 93 miles. Time 5 hours. Road passable to all arms, except from 6th to 8th miles when it is unfit for guns. B astak. Bastak is a town built of sun-dried bricks. It contains 600 houses and the population is between 4,000 and 5,000. It is situated in the centre of a small plain, about 4 miles in length from east to west and 3 miles in breadth from north to south. This plain is enclosed by high mountains on all sides. The town is unfortified and unwall- ed. As seen from the heights above, it presents a most picturesque appearance, being surrounded by green fields and large plantations of palm trees. There is a small fort on the hills to the south of it about 2 miles off. It is the chief town of a district, containing 15,000 inhabitants. They are said to be able to muster 3,000 fighting men—the town of Bastak alone supplying 800 of these. Forty thousand rupees are paid annually by the Governor to the head Governor of Lar. There is no bazar here, people selling and buying in their own houses, and but little is procurable. Supplies. —Wheat and barley, which form the bulk of the crops, and dried dates. Cows, sheep, and goats are very scarce. Camels and asses. Water plentiful from springs, cisterns and wells ; the latter are from 20 to 30 feet deep, and in a gravel soil. Roads run from here to Linga, Bander Abbas, Jena, Lar and Furg. The following route was given me by a muleteer :— 7. Bastak. 9f-69. Bastak. Population. Situation. Forts. Supplies. Transport.

Political, People. The Governor of Bastak is a Sunni, of about 25 years of age, and of preposessing manners. His name is Muntakki Khan ; he has visited Bombay and has a very high opinion of the power of the British Empire. Fatte Ali Khan of Lar is a Shiah and has control over the Khan of Bastak. They both hate each other, and in former times their an cestors used to wage war against one another. A deadly hatred exists between Shiahs and Sunnis and we might well rely on the assistance of the latter if an occupation of the country became necessary. The Khan of Bastak told me that he hoped we should come and take the country, as then there would be freedom from the oppression of the Shiahs. The Russian is never even mentioned in these parts. The inhabitants are, generally speaking, a fine and hardy race of mountaineers, naturally warlike. All possess firearms, which are either old Tower muskets, or match-locks of native manufacture, these latter being rather scarce. Swords are but little used ; men, both on horse and on foot using firearms only. Lances are unknown. Robbery seldom occurs in this district. Three years ago, a man convicted of stealing a horse was bricked up alive in a pillar on the roadside, inside of which his remains are still visible. The district seems extremely well governed, and the people also to be far more friendly to Englishmen than the Shiahs. S ection 2. — B astak to Y ezd. DecGmher 2 r jth^ iSSy, Leave Bastak and proceed up a gentle incline towards a range of hills. The plain narrows as one progresses. At miles a broad stony ravine is entered, and at 3I miles a small caravanserai and a bourkah are passed. Road, now stony, leads up the valley winding about sometimes in and sometimes outside of a nullah, which is very stony and steep in parts, where it twists about between huge boulders and is quite impassable to guns. At 6 miles arrive on the summit of saddle. Elevation about 2,450 feet. Here there is a small caravanserai enclosed by a wall which commands the road ; it is used by the Khan of Bastak as an outpost. A few men posted here could hold the road against a large force advancing from the north on B astak. The ground to either flank is steep and difficult of access. The road now runs by a steep zig-zag descent into the ravine below passing in its descent over flat rocks which are smooth and slippery! At 6^ miles it becomes fairly level, but stony, being cut in the hill side, a deep ravine on its right. At 8^ miles halt at a bourkah full of good water; barren peaks all round. A road branches off on the left to Lar. Road now down a valley between hills, which gradually decrease in height and widen apart. At 9I miles the road leaves itReport of a Journey through Persia. 9 and runs over an open plain. A few trees here and there. Soil stony. Road good and passable to guns, but stony in places. At 13 miles cross a salt stream flowing east; banks gentle and sandy ; water 2 feet deep and 15 to 20 yards wide, fordable in all weathers. Then over level ground to the hamlet of Moolah Werdi. Distance, 144 miles. Time, 6 hours. Road good, except from 35 to 6| miles, when it is 14^ 14^. unfit for guns. A small hamlet of 7 houses. Large date tree plantations. Sup plies none. Water from a well is scarce. Elevation about 1,025 feet. December 28th. —Weather fine. Temperature 54 0 at 8 a.m. Leave Moolah Werdi, crossing two small nullahs. Road good over level ground; soil gravelly. At 5I miles enter the village of Dehun. One hundred inhabitants. Oehun. Supplies little or none. At 7^ miles cross a broad shallow sandy nullah; then on to the village of Tooderoo. Distance, miles. ^Too^deroo. Ti me, 3 hours 28 minutes. Road good, passable to all arms, and ground to either flank suitable to their movements. About 60 inhabitants here. An unwalled village. Supplies and transport scarce. Water from bourkahs and wells. This village is the last within the Khan of Bastak's territory. It is constantly subject to inroads of Arab robbers, who plunder the village, carrying on all the cattle. I now take up an escort of 17 musketmen. There is a road from here to Birkah Lowa village, whence a road is said to run direct to Linga. December 30th, —Weather, fine Temperature 49° 9 ^.M. Leave Tooderoo by a road ascending up a gentle incline over a gravelly plain towards hills, which gradually close in, leaving only an interval of about 300 yards between them at the 3rd mile, when the road be- coming very stony crosses a broad nullah. At 3I miles halt at a bourkah half full of water. Road then winds up along a nullah amongst barren hills; then over clayey ground, until at 7^ miles we reach a water shed in the valley, which forms the boundary between Lar and Bastak. Elevation about 1,700 feet. (Temperature 72 0 .) Then, descending gently, cross three nullahs in succession. Road bad ; impassable to guns, except with difficulty. At gf miles cross a nullah ; then two more in succession which flow into a salt stream oa our left; ground damp and slippery with salt water. Surrounding country mountainous and desolate in the extreme. At 10 miles cross a shallow salt stream flowing north and proceed along its left bank, which is low and commanded by the right. At 10^ miles leave ^ Geshlin stream bed and pass along the foot of the hills on the left to Geshun. ii|—34^io Report of a Journey through Persia, Distance, uf miles. Time, 5I hours. Road, indifferent and pace very slow. Geshun is a small oasis in the desert; it contains a few palm trees and a spring of brackish water. Drinking water from three bourkahs. Supplies, none. Elevation about 1 ,450 feet. December ^oth. —Weather, fine. Temperature 60°. Leave Geshun at 11 a.m. Road over level ground, but stony. At | miles cross a nullah, and another at if miles. At 2\ miles cross the bed of a salt stream. At 2| miles cross a deep nullah with steep and stony sides, impassable to guns (requires cutting and ramping). Then over fairly level ground ; road good amongst low hills, until at 6 miles it enters a broad river bed by an easy descent. This is the River Dundil, which flows east; its water is salt; its bed is 4 mile in width and is im passable in the rains. At 81 miles leave the stony river bed and pass over and amongst low hills. At miles cross a small salt stream twice. At 91 miles descend over open ground towards Hormuz by a good road. At 12 miles halt at Hormuz. Temperature^ 66° at 6-30 p.m. Distance, 12 miles. Time, 5 hours 40 minutes. Road indifferent; passable to guns after infinite labour only. 12—-46^' A small village surrounded by a ruined wall, and about 50 yards square. A few huts outside, a dilapidated caravanserai, and a few ruinous bourkahs about. The village musters 20 fighting men. There is a tower in the centre of the accompanying description. On the approach of danger about ten men retire to it and command the village and approaches by their fire. 30Feet.

The hills in Fauna, the neighbourhood contain several small springs of fresh water, and the great wild sheep and ibex, as well as partridges andsandgrouse abound. The country north of this is very unsettled, being frequented by tribes of roving Arabs, who manifest the greatest hostility to the Per sians, and on this account all the cattle here have been driven away into the hills for security. The road from Bastak to Hormuz is fit for infantry and mountain Genetai J Remarks. batteries only. Field guns would have to be let down by ropes over the Bastak saddle. Numerous ramps and cuttings would have to be made and the road often widened and rocks cleared away. There is no forage en route (except small quantities of kar or chopped straw and dates, with which transport animals are fed in these parts instead of barley). The road is so bad that more time would be saved by using the longer but better routes from Bandar Abbas. The roads from Linga northward cross over numerous mountains; whereas 1 believe that those from Bandar Abbas run up the valleys. Supplies are very scarce en route, but it should be remembered that no rain has fallen for two years. The country, however, does not appear capable of supporting more people than are now living in it. The fighting men form about 30 per cent, of the total inhabitants. Chief animals are goats. Cows and sheep are scarce. Donkeys and camels are the only beasts of burden. Horses are scarce, being only in possession of the wealthy. The climate during the cold weather, from the beginning of Decem- climate, ber to the end of February, is favourable to the European constitution. The effects of rain on movements need hardly be taken into con sideration. The rainy reason is during the cold weather. Latitude 27 0 31' 36'. Elevation about 1,450 feet. January 4th, 18S8. —Weather, fine. Temperature, 64° at 11 A.M. Leave Hormuz by a good road running over an open plain, a few prick ly kunar trees about. Ground hard and stony. At 5I miles the road leaving the plain passes through low hills, and at 6^ miles descends gently over stony ground, skirting the hills on the left. At 71 and at 84 miles cross nullahs. Road still good runs over broken clayey ground. At 91 miles it descends into and runs along a dry river bed. Road hard but stony. Then up out of the river. At ioj miles cross a small fresh-water stream whose banks are covered with grass. This stream flows north-east; its right bank is 20 feet perpen dicular, soil soft. Left bank low and sloping gently. Then over open ground, until at 12\ miles the road runs up a dry and stony ra- desert Camp vine. At iij miles, after leaving the road we halt in a secluded h*—SJa- waterless spot in the desert. Time, 5^ hours. Elevation about 2,100 feet.12 Report of a Journey through Persia. A large party of Arabs, about 500 in all, pass our camp in the night. They are supposed to be part of those beaten in a recent engagement at Darab. The escort turned out awaiting an attack, but fortunately we were not discovered by them. Country passed through very desolate. It is said to be inhabited by nomad Arabs. January $th. —Leave first camp in desert and resume route along nullah, passing along on its left bank, it running south. At miles the road, which is good over gravel, leaves it, and begins to ascend. At if miles skirt two deep rocky ravines on right of road, then over a flat hill top, and at 2I miles commence a descent by a steep road into a rocky ravine 100 feet deep. Cross it and go up another one, and at 31 miles emerge on to a rocky ridge, from which an extensive view of a desolate plain in front is visible. Elevation about 2,250 feet. Descend by a winding road, reaching more level ground at 3I miles ; then over open ground, descending gently towards a level plain pass a high mountain peak on our left, which is separated from the road by ravines. At miles over a level clayey tract which is occasionally subject to inundation. At r ]\ miles cross a salty river, about 70 yards wide from bank to bank, flowing south-east. The right bank com mands. At 7I miles cross a similar stream, 20 yards width of water, about 2 feet deep, also salty. Bed firm. Then up the dry bed of a shallow nullah till Sj miles, there are tufts of long grass about and small green sprouts. Soil occasional patches of sand, and salty clay. A few kunar trees about. Fresh water is procurable in the nullah bed in which I now halt by digging holes, 3 feet deep, when it oozes in slowly. Desolate ranges of hills are visible bounding the plain in all directions, except the west, where the plain stretches away out of sight. Road now over the open plain. At ioi miles pass close to a salty river winding about between high precipitous banks on our left. At 11 miles cross a nullah and pass up along the left bank of the river. At 12 miles leave the river and enter a ravine with high banks. Leave it and ascend over a hill, when at \2\ miles the road becomes very stony, and much broken up by dry water-courses. At 13 miles reach a small tank of fresh water called Ambeh Kalori. A little open ground here. Size of Ambeh about 16 feet by 12 feet, containing 4 feet of water. This is the usual camping place, but we dare not stop, and therefore push on after filling our water bags, and march up a narrow valley, the road skirting and occasionally crossing a nullah which runs down its centre. At 13^ miles through a narrow defile ; then descend into the nullah, leave it, and after passing over rough ground, halt at the second camp in the desert. Distance, 151 miles. Time, 6 hours 40 minutes. Water, none. Marching now is most harassing, as we have men out reconnoitring ahead all the time, and at night have to make preparation to resist attacks.a Report of a Journey through Persia, 13 Road to-day, rough, but passable to all arms except from i| to 3^ miles, and from 13^ to 15I miles, when it is impracticable for guns. Elevation about 2,100 feet. January 6th. —Leave second camp in desert. Weather hitherto very line, but sky to-day overcast; a south wind is apparently bring ing up rain from the Persian Gulf. Road up a valley over very stony ground by a gentle ascent crosses a nullah twice. Hills on the left 300 feet high overlook the road. On the right a series of rounded hills rise in tiers one above the other, throwing out spurs through which the road occasionally defiles by narrow gaps. At 2 miles cross over a watershed and descend down into a valley by a fair road, which winds in and out of a dry water-course. At 3 miles pass between two hillocks and descend amongst little hills ; road narrow, rough and stony ; then down a dry water-course, scrambling over slabs of rock. Road very bad here. At 4 miles emerge from the hills on to a broad open tract. Miles away to the north three ranges are visible, one be hind the other, and running east and west. Conspicuous among them and in the third range towers the snow-white peak of the Kuh-I- Sokhtak, at whose foot lies the city of Furg. Road then descends gently over open ground. Soil hard gravel. At 6 miles a steep de scent of— 13 0 down over a rocky cliff commences, then over a level bar ren plain until Kaleh Bikui is reached. Distance, 8^ miles. Time, 3 hours 30 minutes. Road impassable to field guns from the starting point to the 6th mile. A small village of about 30 houses. Population 100. A large ruined fort occupies the centre of the village. Supplies little or none. Water from wells and springs. During the night we were alarmed by rumours of the Arabs coming down to attack the village. The inhabitants turned out and let off their guns into space by way of scaring the invader, who was conspi cuous by his absence. Elevation about 2,000 feet, January Jth. —Weather fine. Leave Kaleh Bikui by a good road which runs over a level plain. At 15 miles the road becomes stony. At 3 miles, after passing between low hills, it emerges on to another open plain. At 4I miles the road enters a defile between precipitous rocks which in places overhang the road at a height of 300 feet. At 4I miles it passes between two immense upheaved strata, thus, then along through a narrow valley between high hills, which gradually open out and become less lofty, until at 8|: miles the road runs over an open plain, clayey in places. Road good and level, except for stones. At io| milescross two nullahs in quick suc cession, about 20 yards wide, with easy ascent and descent, then over broken ground, ascending and descending, till ii | miles, when, after Kaleh Bikni, —81 2-,J 4 Report of a yourney through Persia. struggling up a rocky tortuous nullah, we halt at a small spring of fresh water in its bed in a pool.

Then down by a very bad road amongst hills, until at 12^ miles it en ters a nullah and ascends its bed. Road now bad and pace slow, as we pass along under overhanging crags. At 13I miles leave the nullah, which in the rains has 6 feet of water in it, and becomes a violent torrent, and ascend. After a short interval descend into it again and proceed along it. The road now becomes a mere climb over boulders and rocks (and if it were not for the fear of my baggage coming to grief, I could not help laughing at the way the baggage animals got over the ground, being pushed, shoved, or dragged in turns by the escort, of 12 men, who take them one by one over the bad bits). Road next out of the nullah along the top of a precipice. Chashma. Then it again descends, and at 15 miles passes a small spring of fresh water in a pool about 2 feet 6 inches square and 2 feet deep, sufficient to fill 4 mussucks, with but slight overflow. Then forward over rocks and gravel, until at 16^ miles we halt in the stream bed. Time, 6 hours 22 minutes, desert Camp Road good till nth mile, when it becomes impassable to guns for 16^—97!. the remainder of the march. Country passed over is desolate in the extreme. The only inhabitants are nomad Arabs. Elevation about 3,150 feet. January 8th. —Leave third camping ground in the desert. Road ascends gently over low but ever increasing hills, then up a steep zig zag ascent to the summit, which it reaches at miles. Road then runs over the hills, still ascending, till at 2| miles it passes over the highest point yet reached (elevation about 3,750 feetj, and commences to descend towards a large plain covered with groves of date trees. On the left of the road is a deep precipitous ravine ; on its right the ground falls gently away. Road fair, gradient 10°. At 4 miles the road becomes bad. At 5^ miles it descends a dry river bed with easy banks, its bed about 200 yards wide. Then leaving it it runs over the open plain, which is sandy and gravelly, but covered with tufts of grass, kunar trees and tamarisk bushes, until at 9^ miles it crosses a shallow dry water-course with steep 6-foot sandy banks. Then pass a newly built square mud enclosure on the right of the road with a tower and houses in it. This is a new fort, built to prevent inroads of the Arabs. Road now over cultivated ground, across which streams of fresh water flow at intervals. Green grass about. At ioj miles the ground becomes swampy. Then passing through groves of date trees halt at the town of Fadumi. Distance, 125 miles. Time, 4^ hours, * Water probably obtainable by digging 3 or 4 feet. Soil rocky and stony.Report of a Journey through Persia. *5 First 51 miles impassable to guns. Remainder fair. There are three vilages here near together—Narz, Kalata, and Fadumi. Total population about 1,000; fighting men 300. The revenue paid by the villages on this plain is said to be 4,000 tumans. Supplies, chopped straw, wheat, barley and dried dates, also cows. Supplies, sheep, goats, and chickens, all in small quantities. Water plentiful from springs and streams. The Arabi Iliyaat Water, camp about here during the cold weather. In the hot weather they move towards Baonat. They are said to subsist by robbing and plundering and are much dreaded by the Persians. Their black tents are visible all round. There is lots of good grazing here and in the surrounding country. Elevation about 2,250 feet. January 10th. —After 20 hours' incessant rain, which I was sup posed to have brought with me, I left the village of Fadumi by a good road running over a shingly plain. At 2 miles road runs up along the right bank of the Shur river, which flows in a south-east direction. Road stony and slippery. Pace very slow. At miles pass a ruined fort on the summit of a rocky hill on our left, and cross the river, the water in it is salty and about 30 yards wide and 3 feet deep in the centre, with a rapid stream. It is now in flood but still rising; its bed is formed of gravel and boulders. Road then over the foot of hills on the right, and up and down over a clayey bank. Pace very slow, as the soil is soft and slippery. At 4 miles pass the junc tion of the Forg river with the river Shur. Road now up the left bank of the Forg river, which is almost hidden from view by rushes and long grass which shelters the wild boar and other game. The water in this river is fresh and full of fish, which, however, at this season will not rise to a fly. Road runs up between two ranges of hills, and at 51 miles crosses the river, bottom sand and earth, and runs up its right bank. Road now a pathway about 20 feet above the river bed. At 7 miles it crosses over to the left bank by a bad descent. The river is easily fordable anywhere. Then leaving the river the road runs over a gravelly plain, and at 8 miles passes over cultivation ; an earthy soil here. Road good. Young wheat coming up in all direc tions. At gf miles it passes through the grass huts of Kohima, and at io ^ miles enters the town of Forg.

Forg or Furg is a town surrounded by a high mud wall, flanked at intervals of 75 yards by round mud towers. There is no ditchj and the defences are in a most ruinous state. A large tower in the centre of the town is used as a keep. The walls could easily contain lii6 Report of a Journey through Persia. Tradesmen.

The total population of the Forg plain does not exceed 500: that is the permanent population, exclusive of wandering Arabs, many of whom are camped in the neighbourhood. Supplies. F or g is governed by a Naib, who is the nephew of Fate Ali Khan of Lar. Revenue is obtained on 20,000 mans of crops ; this, however, only represents a small portion of the amount actually raised. Fire wood is plentiful. Corn and barley are the chief crops. There is no reserve of grain, buried or otherwise. The products are opium, dates, oranges, limes, Indian-corn. There are but few shops. The residents comprise 2 or 3 small merchants, a butcher, a blacksmith, a tinman, a carpenter, and 2 tailors. There are at least three mills worked by water for grinding grain. Five hundred bullocks, 100 donkeys, riding horses 10. I think there are several thousand sheep and goats grazing out amongst the surrounding hills, but the people will not give informa tion,—say 3,000 sheep, 6,000 goats. Water. Plentiful from wells, kanats, streams, and from the Forg river, which rises west of the town. Two miles to the south-east is an ancient fort called Kaleh Baha- man ; it is now in ruins, the walls in places are 15 feet thick; it is built of solid masonry and contains several dry wells. West of the town are the remains of another fort. These ruins and the remains of ancient aqueducts and villages shew what a prosperous place Furg must have been in ancient days, and the fertility of the ground in dicates what it might become once more under a better government. Fauna. Deer, wild duck, bustard, sand-grouse, hares and partridges. Trade. Caravans from Bander Abbas to Darab, Jahrum and Lar pass through here ; none come from Linga. The people know all about the Russians, and ask many questions regarding our relative strength and power. Latitude .

The people are armed with smooth-bore guns, some of European and others of native manufacture, amongst which are Tower muskets of 1859. Cheap English double-barrelled and single-barrelled guns are in use, but the ones preferred are either Tower muskets or guns of native manufacture, as they stand more rough usage. Their weapons carry 200 yards with accuracy, and the people are fair marksmen, considering the roughness of their weapons, which I often tried.Report of a Journey through Persia, This is a common form of backsight. ^ P'rench guns find a ready sale, on account of their cheapness, but they are not thought much of. The nearest place where guns are purchasable is at Darab. February 5th, 7^—While it is raining heavily, leave Forg by a good road except for loose stones, which ascends gently over open ground. At 2 miles pass a water-mill and another at 2f miles, a stream running on our left. At 5 miles up a ravine 5 mile wide be tween mountains. On the left of the road is a deep nullah, in whose bed rushes a swift torrent of fresh water, 70 feet below the road, which at 6i miles becomes too narrow for guns, and crosses a small ravine, when it becomes just wide enough for laden animals to pass one at a time. At 6| miles the road descending crosses the torrent, which is lined with bushes and reeds. Fish are visible lying in the clear pools. Road over sloping rocks is dangerous. Pace very slow. Then cross the stream three times and climb up over rocks on to a masonry aqueduct built on the hill side and in bad repair. Precipitous cliffs on all sides. Then descend, and cross the stream again, enter its bed and wade along it into a basin of water with perpendicular sides, 500 feet high.

Road passable with care to pack animals. At the 10th mile pass Chashma Ali, a small spring of fresh water hid den in a cluster of date trees ; then on up a steep ascent, where bag gage animals must be unloaded and the loads taken up by hand. Then along a narrow ledge 5 feet wide with a cliff on the left and an immense precipice on the right. At 10k miles leave the precipice, and pass up a nullah for 200 yards, when the road leaves it and winds round the summit of a gravelly mountain, until at 12 miles it crosses their summit on a ridge 400 yards wide ; elevation about 4,320 feet; it then descends into a valley towards a tower, and after crossing a dry nullah reaches a clump of date trees and an encampment called Kasiltera Kasiltera „ Shun.

At 7 miles cross a shallow nullah. At 7I miles cross some low hills. At 8 miles cross over a low water-shed, and descend down a rocky narrow ravine impassable to guns. At 95 miles leave the hills, and pass over stony open ground covered with small shrubs till the 13th mile, when the road again ascends over low hills; then descending, at the 14th mile it reaches the Iliyat camp of Rosak. Time, 6 hours 20 minutes. Road for first four miles impassable to guns. Elsewhere fair. Rosak consists of two small camps of black tents, inhabited by Per sian Jliyats ; in all about 100 tents.

Fifteen horses, 200 donkeys, 500 sheep, 1 ,000 goats. Water is obtained from wells south-west of the camp. This is the head-quarters of a nomad tribe; their Khan is Ameer Kuli Khan, a drunken, dissolute man. The people are great robbers. This place has been visited by Yusef Khan and his brother Asheraf Khan, both of whom are Russian Armenians, who belong to a firm at Sabzawar, but have been trading recently at Bander Abbas. Their whole party consisted of 5 men, and the people here say that they were buying up walnut trees, cutting them down and conveying them to the sea coast. Also it is said they owned bullocks which they brought to Guloo Kuh to graze. Elevation about 5,510 feet. February gth. —Leave Guloo Kuh. The road skirts along the foot of hills on the left.

Khavre contains about 70 houses and a small dilapidated fort in the centre. It stands on a low mound on a small plain; it has fre quently been attacked by Bhalus, Bakhtiaris and Arabs, one of which tribes sacked the town four years ago. A road runs from here to Saidabad, 12 farsakhs. There is a village called Henja, 1 farsakh from here, and there are several large gardens close by.Report of a Journey through Persia. 23 Water is plentiful from kanats.

Road, good so far, now becomes stony and winds along the foot of steep but low hill on its left. At 4I miles it runs along a moist and stony water-course. At 4! miles it passes a pool of fresh water fed by a stream, and then runs down along a level gravelly water-course with open ground to either flank. At 5I miles halt at the hamlet of Merao.

Robbers occasionally come here and spend a few days in the village, and then go off taking what they want. If the people oppose them, they kill them. Their last visit is said to have been seven days ago, and from the poverty -stricken look of the place, I should say that this was true. February 2^.—Weather, fine. Leave Merao by a hard and gra velly road which passes along the left bank of a shallow water-course. Low hills rise in parallel rows on either side. Then amongst hillocks and broken ground, descending gradually, till at 1 mile the road leaves the hills and runs over an open plain. Road good. On the right the plain is bounded by the Kuh-I-Aag, which is evidently an extinct volcano, whose crater having ultimately filled with water, which has been too heavy for it, has burst, breaking down a side of the mountain. There is another Kuh-I-Aag further on, exactly similar to this one in its formation. On the left an open plain extends as far as the hii.s of Baonat, where two snow ranges are seen, one behind the other, over the top of a low black range, which is now visible. This plain is a continuation of the plain of Robat. The road then gets covered with big loose stones troublesome for guns, but through which 6 or 7 camel- paths free from stones run, side by side. At i8| miles a road leaveSj going half left towards a range of hills, where Chah Mil is at 4 farsakhs distance.

Leave camping ground by a road which is good and runs over open ground, which is, however, stony in places, and impedes the rate of marching. At 2k miles the road divides into two, the one to the right going to Yezd also; but as it lies over low ground, I think it is probably a dry weather road. I take the road to the left, which is good and free from stones. At i64 miles cross a shallow water-course, and then proceed up a gentle incline between two hills. At 2o| miles the high road from Herat-I- Kharah to Yezd joins us on the left, when we proceed along it—an excellent broad and hard way. At 2if miles cross a low water-shed between precipitous barren hills. Elevation about 6,360 feet. Then commence a gentle descent over open ground.

At 8| miles enters the city of Yezd. Elevation 3,800 feet. Yezd. Yezd is a city about 2 miles in length from north-west to south-east City, and ij miles broad. It is built almost entirely of mud or sun-dried bricks, a few of the better houses as well as some of the mosques and other public buildings being faced with burnt bricks. The fort or ancient city is surrounded by a high mud wall flanked Fort, by towers at about 50 yards interval. Outside this high wall runs a low one with a command of about 9 feet over the glacis, and giving a second tier of fire. Outside this lower mud wall runs a ditch with per pendicular unrevetted sides of a width and depth of about 20 feet. The weaker points of the building are defended by round towers con nected with the main building by arched bridges; the ditch being26 Report of a Journey through Persia. Troops. ■mament. Telegraph.

The Governor lives in a fortified enclosure—the citadel, which is in side the fort. The citadel is the only part of the defences which are not in a ruinous and unserviceable condition. It is similar in construc tion to the rest of the fort, and like it, has mud walls about 30 to 40 feet in height. These are about 8 feet thick at the base and taper gradually upwards, till at the parapet the thickness does not exced 1 foot. It is entered by two gate-ways, one being on the north-west and the other on the south-east face. The ditch in each instance is crossed by a permanent single-arched bridge. The fort has evidently been unused as such for many years, the in terior being choked up with a mass of houses, through which run nar row winding streets, some of which are roofed over and so low that it is impossible for a horseman to ride through them. In many places all the interior works have fallen away, leaving lines of loop-holes 15 or 16 feet above the ground, where they are quite useless. The fort contains the Jama Masjid, an ancient building, whose lofty minarets are the first object to strike the eye when viewing the city from a distance. Several of the irregularly built bazars of the city wind in and out of the fort on the south-west side, and as they are roofed over, it is hard to tell whether one is inside or outside. There are no troops. 500 cavalry are, however, allowed to the Yezd district for the purpose ot robber-catching. There are no organiza- tions of a military sort. Guns, none. There is a Persian Telegraph Offi ce. Single wire lines run from here to Shiraz and Kirman. The Post Office is worked on the European system. There are weekly mails to Bander Abbas and Bushire. The ^ezd district was formerly under the government of Shiraz, but now, in 1888, it has been formed into a separateMistrict directly under the Supreme Government at Teheran. There is an Assistant Governor as well as the principal one 7 he Government of the district is farmed out. The last Governor held it for 250,000 tomans. The customs are farmed for 47 000 to mans. The population of Yezd is about 65,000 or 100,000, inclusive ot Taft and the adjacent suburbs. Of these 6,000 are Parsis and qoo are Jews, y Since the last famine in 1870 the population has been steadily in creasing. J The Parsis possess four fire temples, which are, however con cealed in private houses, for fear lest the Muhammadans should de file them.Report of a Journey through Persia. 27 The Parsis have been gradually driven out of the chief parts of the city until there only remains to them the south-eastern suburb and some adjacent villages. They are much persecuted by the Mu- hammadans, and are not allowed to wear any clothes except those of a khaki colour, nor is it allowed them to ride in any of the main streets of the city. In times of tumult, the Parsis are always the first victims. Their High Priest as well as their secular head or 'Kalantar' reside here. The Jews also suffer persecution. They are distinguished from jews, the rest of the inhabitants by being compelled (no matter how wealthy they are) to wear a patch on their garments. The climate is very healthy and, as a rule, dry and bracing, ciimate. During the coldest month of the year, December, the thermometer ranges from 30° to 37 0 Fahrenheit, but at the beginning of June it rises to 90°, which is the maximum temperature. The water, which is good and sufficient to meet the requirements water, of the town, as well as to irrigate a large number of gardens, is ob tained from near the foot of the Shirkuh, whence it is brought by kanats starting at a depth of 100 feet. The kanats approach the town from the south and south-west. There are said to be at least 70. It would be difficult to cut off the water-supply from the city altogether, as some of the streams run at a great depth below the ground, and passing on, supply suburbs to the north. These subterranean streams are reached from the city by long flights of steps descending towards them through subterranean pas sages. Yezd being simply an emporium of trade situated in the middle Supplies, of an unproductive plain, does not contain supplies sufficient for the consumption of her own inhabitants. Consequently sheep are im ported from Shiraz and grain from Ispahan. It is only during the months of October, November and December that the city subsists on its own grain raised in the neighbourhood. Special arrangements would have to be made for the supply of any large force halting here.

There were formerly 50,000 camels in the city, but since the in troduction of the camel tax of 2 tomans per camel, the number has fallen off to about 15,000. There are, however, mules and asses to the equivalent of 35,000 camels. Mules preponderate. Horses are scarce. The people of Yezd are not horsemen ; they prefer riding donkeys. There are good camping grounds for a large force between Mu- hammadabad and Yezd. Water plentiful. Soil gravel and sand. The nearest position from which the city could be defended against a force advancing from the south is at Muhammadabad. The position of the city, low down, its irregular and straggling nature would prevent its being defended from any nearer point. Since the introduction of the telegraph and post office Yezd has become an important centre of trade. The impoits are Indian goods, as well as English of all descrip tions, amongst which are yarns, piece-goods, prints, sugar, refined sugar, copper sheets, tin slabs, lead, iron, condiments, China-ware, glass-ware, spices, green tea, Indian tea, and Singapore tea. These imports come chiefly from Bombay through Bander Abbas; and after a sufficient quantity has been taken for local use, the remainder goes on from this city to the following places:— T eheran. Meshed, Kashan, Sabrawar, Birjand, Toon, Tabbas. The exports of Yezd are opium, cotton, wool, madder-roots, cum min-seeds, almonds, walnuts, pistachio-nuts, &amp;c. Yezd is the centre of the opium trade, about 2,000 chests of opium being annually ex ported to Bombay via Bander Abbas, and thence sent on to China. This opium is not only the produce of Yezd, but is also that of many other parts of the country, for instance, Samnan, Bajistan, and Gu- nabad. Most of the imports and exports come and go via Bander Abbas, which port is connected with this city by three routes—the first be ing the well-known one via Karman, the second via Sirjun, and the third route via Herat-I-kharah, Niris. Katru, and the Tan^-I-zan tures. manu ac ' The principal of these is the ' chaudar' orouter covering worn by , women.

It appears that the Russians have a better knowledge of the tastes and requirements of the Persian people than we have, and conse quently know better how to suit them. In Yezd, there are some 15 naturalized British subjects (qualified Br ' t . i,,h by residence in India), both Mussulmans and Parsis. It is through 8ubjec,, ■ their hands that the whole of the trade in English goods and the bulk of the trade from Bander Abbas passes. These merchants, among whom are several men of good education, for instance, Ardeshir Mehirban Irani, who is a B. A. of one of the Indian Col leges, possess great influence in Yezd. They are disposed to be loyal towards the British Government. Owing to the insecurity of life and property, these men dare not invest more than a quarter of their fortunes in trade. The British Government has hitherto refused to protect these men in any way whatever, consequently they are liable to ill-treatment, extortion and persecution, especially the Parsis, whose lives are often in danger and sometimes lost. Through the Paisis half the trade with Bombay passes. I have just stated that the Muhammadan merchants require protec tion as well as the Parsis. This is the case, for in Persia, when a merchant is wealthy, the Governor always squeezes as much of it out of him as he can. Several of these merchants belong to the Bab sect and from long residence in India have learnt to look with toleration upon men of other creeds. Their doing this is sufficient to arouse the dislike of their stay-at-home and more fanatical fellow-citizens, who, envious of their wealth, would be only too glad to do them a bad turn should an opportunity present itself. If protection were afforded to these merchants, either by the es- Encouragement tablishment of a native agent to look after their safety and the j n . of British trade - terests of trade, or by their being taken under the protection of one of the British agents in Persia, the effect on British trade would be astonishing. These merchants would lay out nearly four times the amount its future, which they now do in trade. The Parsis of Yezd would form com panies and firms, establish factories and banking corporations, and import and export goods of English manufacture for local as well as foreign consumption to a vastly larger extent than they do now. English commercial influence would then, as it should, become paramount in these parts. Since the above was written the Karun river has been opened up to-navigation, and Haji Mirza Muhammad Taki has been appointed Russian agent at Yezd.3° Report of a Journey through Persia. The opening up of the Karun river will not affect the trade of Yezd. In order to develop it other steps must be taken. The first of these should be the immediate appointmentof an agent to the city. Other things would then follow of themselves,—for instance, the merchants, feeling secure, would, of their own accord, as is customary in the country, commence improving the communications with the Persian Gulf, by levelling the roads, building cisterns, erecting cara vanserais, and sinking wells where necessary. The subjoined extract from the diary of Mr. E. G. Browne, which was kindly furnished to me by that gentleman, who was recently tra velling in Persia, is of interest as bearing on the subject in ques tion :— 'Yezd is too well-known, and has been so often visited and described, that I will merely add a few impressions which I received during the 20 days I spent here. ' 1. That the Governor, the Imdd ul Daula is a very good and capable one. '2. That Yezd is really one of the most flourishing and opulent towns in Per sia, and that the really poor are much fewer than in almost any town there. ' 3. That its merchants are many of them of great ability, integrity and enter prise, with a large connection not only through Persia, but with India, China, Beyrout, and some of them have a large command of capital. They are, owing to their connection with India, and in the case of the Zoroastrians especially, many of whom have been themselves at Bombay, warmly attached to the English, of whose greatness they have very high ideas ; many of them expressed a great wish that some day a railway would be made to connect them with the Gulf. They asked me what its cost would probably be. ('The same feeling prevailed in Karman.') Those of them who are under British protection or are British subjects, are ex tremely proud of the fact, and many who were not so were anxious to become Brit ish subjects, if possible. 'Amongst the Zoroastrians several know English, notably their chief merchant, Ardeshir Mehirban, a most admirable man in every way. Amongst the Mussul man merchants, the richest and most powerful are Haji Mirza Muhammad Taki, and, among his relatives, Haji Leyjid Mirza, originally of Shiraz, who are also most kindly and upright men. One of the sons of the former, a young man of 30 or so, named Haji Mirza Muhammad, knows English a little. ' As to the condition of the Zoroastrians, it is better than it was formerly, but they are still subject to many vexatious laws, and are often insulted or unjustly treated without being able to obtain redress.' E dward G. BROWNE, M.A., M.B., • Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge. With regard to the construction of a railway, I found the people much interested in the subject. The only remarks that I can offer are— ' That a line could be constructed from Yezd to Niris with but little difficulty, for, although the elevations crossed are great, yet the gra dients are very easy, the greater part of the line running over a&lt;© Report of a Journey through Persia. 31 level plain. To the south, between Niris and the Persian Gulf, the country is, I believe, very mountainous. The best route directly south would probably be Darab, Lar, Mughu Bay, where there is said to be a good caravan route. But I should think that the best direction to .follow from Niris, would be a line running in a south-east direction towards Bander Abbas. The line then would run in conformation with the general line of the mountains, and an easy route might be found along the valleys and river banks/' From the foregoing remarks on the commercial importance of Yezd, it would be easy to estimate whether such an enterprise would be profitable or otherwise.

Water, a trifle salty, is obtained from a streamlet flow ing from a line of kanats. Road now over an open gravelly plain, which at a short distance on the left terminates in a kavir. The plain is covered with small plants, and even occasional tufts of grass are seen. The road over it is excellent. At 16^ miles the road cross es part of the kavir by a hard beaten track about 10 feet wide. The 4. istcampin ground on either side is very heavy walking.

At 4 mile the road passes over kavir by a narrow footpath which shortly disappears ; then over rough and honey combed ground, pitted with large round holes, across which men and animals labor slowly. At 2 miles leave the kavir, and ascend up a slight incline over a hard gravelly plain. A few shrubs and grass about. At 55 miles we reach the Hauz-I-Khunda, a tank with a domed roof, which is dry. At 7I miles the road becomes stony; it then runs up the bed of a dry water-course over soft sand, and passes between low hills covered with shrubs and tufted grass. Here we pass about 3,000 sheep who have come here from Nain to graze, as this is the nearest reported grazing ground which that city is said to possess. At 9^ miles we pass low hills covered with tufts of green herbage. Road indifferent on account of loose stones. At io| miles Tut appears in sight away to our left, towards which we march, cross ing water-courses every hundred yards or so, till at i2| miles we halt at that village.

No sign of a road whatever. Tut is a small and picturesque village of about I 5 houses, and contains an old caravanserai of burnt bricks, which is situated on the east side of the road between two hillocks. It is about 40 yards square, with walls 6 to 8 feet thick, of solid masonry. It has an all- round walk on the vaulted roof, which possesses a low 14-inch thick parapet. Elevation 3) I 4 0 feet. There are about 10 acres of wheat and other cultivation here. The supply of water is plentiful and pure, being obtained from two streams which issue from the hill-side and fill two small ponds. Supplies—chopped straw for bullocks, dates, raisins, &amp;c.—pro curable in small quantities, but the supply is not reliable. Roads run from here to Ardekan, Yezd, Anarak and Beyaza.

Leave Tut . at 9 A.M., and resume my journey towards Anarak, by a fair road which passes through a gap in a hillock chain on the right and then runs down a gravelly stream-bed between low hills. At 2 miles the road leaves the stream-bed and goes over broken ground strewn with stones and boulders, and interspersed with shallow dry water-courses, with shrubs and grass about, as well as low bushes. Pace very slow. The road requires clearing for guns. At 4^ miles the road becomes better, though still slightly uneven, and at 6^ miles it passes over perfectly even gravelly ground and becomes excellent. At 7 miles cross a road from Ardekan to Zarin. At 9I miles the road, reaching its lowest point, runs over a hard clayey tract, which becomes incor porated with the kavir lower down. At ioi miles it leaves the clayey soil and commences to ascend gently over a sloping range of hills. Soil soft and sandy. The kavir on our left extends as far as the eye can see. At 131 miles we cross a broad, well-trodden, camel track which leads from Ardekan to Jandak, and is probably a conti nuation of the road by which I came from Chah Khorassun. At 13^ miles the road crosses a broad sandy water-course, with easy 20-foot banks. Then on, over undulating soft ground, till at 14I miles we halt in a ravine. Time, 65 hours. Supplies none.

At 8 a.m. leave se cond camp in desert. Road same as during the latter pait of yester day's march. At miles a long and gradual descent commences. At 3 miles the road becomes firm and hard over gravel soil. At 6 miles the road passes over 100 yards of clay, when it reaches the lowest point, within \ mile of the kavir. Then over level ground till 64 miles, when, after crossing a shallow water-course, it commences to ascend gently, till at 8 miles it enters a shallow water-course, turns sharp to the right, and ascends, amongst broken ground which is salty and sandy, in a shallow stream bed. At 8f miles it runs over a mass of salt in the dry stream-bed, which is 6 inches thick. Then over fairly open ground till the 10th mile, when it runs between low gravelly ridges 60 feet apart. These hills are everywhere passable for infantry and entirely destitute of vegetation. Road then amongst low hills, 200 yards apart, commences to descend. Here the road is sunk 3 feet below the surrounding ground, which is soft, and is in places only 3 feet wide, and has several short and abrupt ascents and descents. The ground on both flanks is soft sand, covered with a hard crust, and is heavy going, besides being cut up by innu merable small water-courses : this lasts for 200 yards, when at io| miles the road descends over a steep 25-foot bank into a broad and dry gravelly stream bed, 90 yards wide, with a firm gravel bottom, (A ramp required here for guns. Soil soft.) Road then straight up the stream-bed for a few yards; then to the left up a broad gravelly water-course without banks, till at 13^ miles it runs over a hard open piece of ground at the foot of the Siah Kuh covered with good camel grazing. (At 14I miles the guide loses the road for several hours. The correct one, however, is as follows ) At 17 miles the road, approaching a range of hills, enters a valley which gradually narrows till it runs up a winding, rocky, pathway and de scends to a cleft in the rocks, where we halt at Chah-I-Kasim Wazeera Distance 2o| miles.

Road still descending, at i| miles crosses a road from Sare Jaida, which goes on to Sabze Chah, Heizum Chah, and Anarak. At 2 miles the road runs over uneven ground, very rough for guns. At 2\ miles the road becomes good down an open valley. Hills all round. At 3I miles the road turns to the left up another valley % mile wide ; then it runs over hard, stony ground, and at 4I miles descends down a stream-bed, easy banks, with a firm gravelly bottom, and goes through a narrow opening in a steep and impassable range of rocky hills. At 5^ miles cross another road from Sabze Chah to Sare Jaida, which runs up a ravine. The road now runs through an opening 18 feet wide in a rocky ridge; then up through a valley, till at 6| miles it commences to de scend gently. Then pass a spring of salty water bubbling up from under some rocks ; the ground over which it flows is encrusted with salt. Road is still good. At 8| miles it descends into a broad dry stream bed ; banks steep and about 16 feet high. At 9^ miles ascend out of it. The road, good over sand and gravel, now skirts along the foot of a rocky range of hills. At ii| miles it passes the Kuh-I-Nahr on the right. At 16^ miles it passes the Kuh-I-Mardine on its right.

Even this could be rapidly converted into a good road, by a little cutting and ramping here and there. From to 5? miles the road is indifferent; the remainder is good. Water is obtained here from a well, said to be in a gravel soil, with water 15 feet from the surface and g feet in depth ; diameter of well 3 feet. (Lost the road in the dark ; utterly tired.) There is said to be another well in the neighbourhood. April jth. —Temperature 65°. Sky overcast at 9 a.m. Leave Chah Gumbuz by a road which runs over stony and uneven ground. At 1 mile the road becomes free from stones and runs over sandy soil with tufts of grass about. An immense barren plain lies on our right. Road now commences to ascend gently, and at 3I miles passes up a valley between low hills. At 5I miles it goes up a gravelly stream bed, 60 yards wide, amongst low hills and broken ground. At 7^ miles it narrows to 14 feet, when the road, winding about amongst hills, becomes stony and indifferent, being impassable to guns. At yf miles it crosses a water-shed, 100 yards wide, between two peaks. Elevation 4,850 feet. It then descends gently between accessible.38 Report of a Journey through Persia. easy sloping hills, which it leaves at 8j miles, and runs over open sandy ground covered with tufts of grass. At gf miles it commences to as cend gently over clay and gravel. The ground on the left falls away towards a great plain said to extend to Nain. At io| miles the road passes between low gravelly hillocks; then on, over alternate patches of sand and gravel, till at 12 miles it runs across clayey ground, covered with low hills in every direction between two high precipitous rocky mountain ranges. (At this point a heavy storm breaks upon us ; it becomes as dark as twilight, while black clouds cover the sky, pouring up in dense masses from the west; first a blast of cold wind, and then down comes the rain in torrents. Flashes of lightning play around, whilst the crash of thunder resounds amongst the neighbouring hills. The baggage animals refuse to face it, and huddle together in a helpless mass. As soon as the first violence of the storm abates, we once more urge the animals along on their road, which, being over clay, is now yield ing and slippery. Torrents are seen tearing down the sides of the neighbouring mountains, while every now and then with a dull roar we see immense masses of rock and earth come sliding down their barren sides.) At 141 miles the road runs over the summit of the pass, and descends through a narrow water-course, for 200 yards, too narrow in places for guns, with 6 feet steep clayey banks, and broken ground on either side. It then descends and runs over a small plain, which is sandy and stony. Here it crosses two broad shallow stony water-courses and at 16^ miles enters a broad, shallow, gravelly stream bed which it leaves at i6| miles. Then leaving the hills it passes over open gently falling ground, part of a great plain of gravel stretch ing away west to Nain. Then it commences to ascend gently, and passing through a cluster of rocks, at the 20th mile reaches the city of Anarak. Time, about 6| hours.

They forced a dispute on me after my treating them with the greatest civi lity and forbearance. This ultimately led to my being stoned by a mob of men, women and children, who shouted ' Kill the Kafir, kill the Kafir.' The Governor refused to help me, and it was only owing to a timely display of fire-arms, and some muleteers of another town assist ing me, that I escaped with my life. April gth. —Rain yesterday.

Leave Chah Shur by a good road, which runs along a dry stream-bed 70 yards wide, with a firm level gravelly bottom. Low rounded acces sible hills on either side. At \ mile the road, leaving the hills, passes over more open ground, though still in the stream-bed, which is now 150 yards wide, with easy 6-foot banks. Excellent grazing ground for sheep in spring time lies to the right and left. At if miles, the road, still descending along the stream-bed, enters a low and rocky range of accessible hills 100 yards apart, and much cut up by small ravines. Vegetation but little. At 2\ miles the road gives a sharp turn to the rights and curves round a rocky ridge, which has command ed it since its entering the defile. At 3^ miles the hills on either side, till now about 900 yards apart, fall away as the road runs along in the stream-bed, now 4 00 yards in width, with 12 or 14-foot steep banks. At 5 miles a hillock is passed on our right. At 5^ miles the stream-bed opening out loses itself in an immense extent of gravelly ground which falls gently towards the kavir. The ground here is covered with bushes, shrubs, and tufts of grass. (Sheep from Shahrab, 100 houses, and Mahibad, 1,000 houses, both many miles to the south of this, come to graze here in the early spring time.) Water for the herds is obtained by constructing dams in the stream water, beds and also from springs, the outflow from which latter is then more considerable than now. We pass several dams, but they are perfect ly dry. At 9I miles over a mixture of sand and gravel. At 12 miles descend over a bank, and cross over soft sand and gravel amongst sand- hillocks. Then, still descending gently at 13I miles, reach the kavir, which it crosses by a i-foot wide hard beaten camel-track. Ground soft and uneven on both sides. At 14 miles cross a small salt water stream, and crossing it lose the track and stick fast in a swamp for 25 minutes, when the animals being extricated we once more resume our journey. Elevation about 2,700 feet. At 141 miles the road leaves the kavir and commences to ascend gently over soft sandy rising open ground.

Elevation about 2,900 feet. Aprt7 ijth.— Thermometer broken. Weather fine. March over the same sort of ground as in the latter part of yesterday's march. The ground is covered with low bushes. At 4^ miles the road descends into a dry river-bed with a hard gravel bottom covered by 1 or 2 inches of surface clay about 70 yards wide, with steep 2o-foot banks, which require cutting here to pass guns. (River-bed is the only practicable route, as the neighbouring country consists of soft sand ; soil much cut up by nullahs.) The river seldom contains more than 1 foot of water, and its bed dries rapidly. At 4I miles the river-bed is 40 yards wide' and 14 feet below the surrounding country. At r i\ miles over more open ground. At 10 miles the road is in a stream-bed roo yards from bank to bank. At 13^ miles the road enters a defile between rocky flat-topped hills, 160 yards apart at the narrowest point. At 14 miles it runs alongside of a soft and slippery stream-bed, with salty water lying here and there. At 14^ miles we leave the'main road and turning to the right, pass a rocky range on our left, and at 15^ miles reach a Chashma hidden away amongst rocky hills. Time, 4^ hours. Road good, passable to all arms, but heavy for guns until the dry river-bed is reached. Water from springs in an open place surrounded by rock. Stand- ing supply is equivalent to 27' x 27' x 2'. If the stream were dammed up and a puddled basin prepared, a large supply of water would be available in three or four days. There are several other small springs in the neighbourhood, but they are salty. One hundred camels are grazing here belonging to Arabs from the neighbourhood of Teheran. The wild sheep, ibex, panther and sand-grouse abound in these hills. Elevation 3,340 feet. 18th April. Weather fine, but a violent wind blowing apparently in every direction. Leave Kuh-I-Tulha, passing for the first | miles over yesterday's route ; then turning to the right, ascend a dry gravelly stream bed between high rocky hills 50 yards apart. Pace slow on account of the strong head wind. Then on over gravelly ground through a basin formed of sandy hillocks rising in tiers Stream bed wet and salty here and there. At 3 miles cross a low water-shed anddescend between two banks by a narrow footpath, too•1 mil Report of a Journey through Persia, 45 i! 1 narrow for guns for 150 yards, but easily to be made passable as the banks are sandy and soft. Then down along a water-course about 20 yards wide and gradually opening out to 30 yards. At 5^ miles the road emerges on to open ground, which stretches away to the foot of the Siah Kuh (a high mountain on the left which is said to possess five copious springs of freshwater. Fossil fish are found there.) Turning to the right we pass over uneven, sandy, reddish soil, till at the 6th mile we reach a brackish stream issuing from the hills on our right. Then on, over open ground, descending gently. Soil clay and gravel till at 10 miles the road enters a dry stream bed and runs over its hard sandy bottom 30 feet wide amongst broken ground. At miles the road leaves the water-course and running between two high hillocks passes over an open plain. Here the guide loses the road, and we wander along the zig-zag traverse laid down, which runs up to 17! miles over firm gravel, and then goes over soft sand amongst drifts. Rising ground on the right conceals the great kavir from us. At 19 miles, hav ing lost our road, we halt in the desert in a dry stream-bed. Time cannot say actually, but about r ]\ hours. Road generally good, excep tion as noted, but unsuitable for guns. Elevation 2,690 feet. April igth. —Weather fine. Leave camp, and at 5 mile strike on to the road which was lost last night, which, if it had been followed, would have made yesterday's march only 17 miles. Then on, over undulat ing soft sand till at 2j miles we reach Chah Mesh Mus, where in a dry stream bed are three wells of water a trifle brackish, but quite drinkable. Soil fine gravel and sand. Water 6 feet below the sur face. The wells contain each about 3 feet of water, and are only 3 feet diameter at the surface, but are 4 feet square down below. There are about 1,100 sheep and 1,000 goats belonging to Arabs 18. chah Mesh from the neighbourhood of Teheran, who come here to graze their jgl' 2921-. herds in the spring. Then on up out of the stream bed over its steep 25Toot gravel bank. At 3 miles up over another steep gravel bank, gradient + 13 0 on to a plain covered with low bushes and tufts of grass which give it quite a fertile appearance. On the left it stretches away descending gently for several miles till it ends in an immense flat expanse of reddish sand, which fading away into the distance is streaked in many places with white salt. Atmosphere a little foggy. At 5I miles the road descending runs over barren ground formed 19. Desert, of hard clay and alternate patches of sand. At 7I miles halt in the 7*—3 00 - tWK&gt; desert.

At | miles the road runs over kavir, a swollen puffed up glazed crust with a powdery soil beneath it. Color, Naples yellow. A man or camel can walk over it without difficulty, but horses, donkeys D46 /?&lt; port of a Journey through Persia. and mules labor heavily through it unless on the road, which consists of two camel tracks, each about 14 inches wide. This kavir extends away out of sight to the left, being probably connected with the swamps shewn in many maps to the south-east of Teheran. To the right it also extends, as far as the eye can see, right along the foot of the Kuh I Gugird. Saltwater AH vegetation has ceased. At 4 miles the road descends over a 3-foot bank into a stream bed flowing from west to east. The ground now becomes dark-colored and swampy. At 4I miles we reach the edge of a steep 5-foot bank, muddy and slippery, beyond which is 30 feet of water, very salt and up to a man's waist. A stick 8 feet long thrust into the bank at its edge disappears in it. Rate of stream 25 y ard s in 37 seconds, or about miles an hour. This river pro. bably drains the low kavir north of the Siah Kuh into the Great Kavir. The drift on the stream banks consists of chopped straw, sticks, and camel dung. In flood the river would be at least 8 feet deep. The best crossings are 200 yards above and 200 yards below the track. Elevation uncertain, is between 1,400 and 2,400 feet. A floating bridge would be the most suitable. The marshy approaches could be rendered passable by binding bundles of brushwood (to be found 6 miles back on the road), and sinking them into the ground at the crossings alluded to. There is now only 18 inches of water for 20 feet. 1 he direct road across is only used in the hot weather.

It has a level top, and resembles an immense cause- way. It stretches away in one continuous line east and west as far as one can see. It is hard to believe that it is natural, the sides are so regular and the top so level; it is about 50 feet high.

The road winds amongst bro ken hillocks of puffed-out sand, which look like well-baked pie-crust. The road now crosses 3 dry level-banked water-courses. At 7^ miles it commences to descend, and at 8 miles runs over hard clay and sand, a water-course on its right. The road now passes over an immense plain, which, falling away from the foot of the Kuh-I-Gugird on the right, descends towards th Kuh-I-Gitcha, which bounds it on the left. The scenery is appallingly desolate. On the right rise the red, barren, and waterless hills of the Gugird (or sulphur) range.

The city is situated at the foot of a large expanse of open ground situation, which rises gradually towards the west, ending in a range of hills about 4 miles off. The city is surrounded by a mud wall about 8 feet thick, and r8 to 20 feet high, with round flanking towers at about 60 yards interval. It posesses 5 arched gateways, each of which is guarded by two round towers. It has no ditch; the walls are not in good repair. On its west and south-west sides there are numerous buildings and high walled gardens built outside and adjoining the city walls. The city is supplied with water by a single stream from the high water-»u t piy. mountains north-west of it. This stream is about / x 1' in depth, and flows 360 feet per minute. It runs to within i| miles of the high road west of the city ; there, after falling over a weir between two small hillocks,* it divides into 7 streams, which, radiating from this point flow into the city and its suburbs. A party occupying these hillocks and the adjacent tower could in a few minutes divert the stream on to the dry and gravelly surrounding soil and thus deprive the city of almost its entire supply of water. The only other stream supplying the city is a small one flowing alongside the Mazandaran road, and half a mile north of the one just referred to. * From this point the city bears H5,5° Report of a Journey through Persia. Camping ground. Population. Forts. Public Buildings. Supplies. Transport. There is an excellent camping-ground north-west of the city just beyond the Teheran-Mestied road ; this ground is about 4 miles in length and one in breadth, but there is no firewood procurable for several miles. About 4,000 houses and 16,000 inhabitants. Jews are not allowed to reside here. Garrison, none. The Governor is a prince, and lives inside a large oblong enclo sure surrounded by a high castellated and loop-holed mud wall with round corner towers, and flanking towers at intervals. This enclo sure projects from the city, part of it being inside. The city has a prosperous look about it, and the numerous fruit- gardens and wheat-fields give to it a most pleasing and verdant ap pearance in pleasant contrast to the barren desert around. The telegraph office, which is inside the enclosure just referred to, is worked by a Persian. Wires run from here to Meshed and to Teheran, all the officials being native, except at Meshed and Teheran. , Messages by Englishmen, however, take precedence over all others, and the line is kept in repair by an English Superintendent, but by the Indian Telegraphs. The post office is a Persian one, the post master being a captain of Persian infantry. There are three good cavavanserais here usually thronged w 7 ith travellers. There is also a post-house or chapar-khana, all being outside the city walls. The town contains a large and handsome mosque. The annual crops are 300,000 mans of wheat, 3,000 of cotton and 100,000 mans of barley. Opium is also cultivated. Five cavalry regiments have passed through here within the last 10 days, each halting one or tw T o days. Bread, barley and grass have therefore risen in price, and are said to be getting scarce. Notice is given of the arrival of regiments beforehand, but not of the duration of their halts. One thousand five hundred travellers are said to pass through here daily, many of them taking with them supplies for several days. Three hundred pilgrims left for Mecca the other day taking with them a three-months' supply of bread, rice, flour, ghee, tea, etc. N.B. —Three hundred men for 90 days = 9,000 men's supplies for 3 days. Firewood is obtained from the country bordering on the kavir south of this. About 4,000 camels, 200 mules, 1,000 asses. Riding horses 150. Cows one or two thousand. There are said to be many thousand sheep at Sangesir, 3 farsakhs north-west of this, who graze there dur ing the summer months, but in the cold weather and early spring they graze in the neighbourhood of Chashma Dubor and Gil Chashma.Report of a Journey through Persia. 51 There are three roads from here to Yezd, 1st the one via Jandak, communiea- passable in all weathers except after very heavy rain ; 2nd, the road tl0lls ' styled Biabun wa Biabanak, the Kuh-I-Gatch and Anarak, i.e., the one I came by ; jraf, a road via the.

The position of Samnan is therefore of importance as being the point on which many desert routes converge. Products—sulphur, copper, wheat, barley and cotton. Manufac- Trade, tures—copper utensils. The chief industry is the manufacture of blue pyjamas, which are universally worn by all ranks in Persia, 1 he dye for these is said to be imported via Bander Abbas from Hindustan. A considerable trade by desert routes is kept up with Yezd. Rice and dried fish from Mazandaran. Sugar and other imports imports, find their way here from Bushire.

There are 5 flour-mills on the streams west of the city, all worked by Fiour-miis. water. M GENERAL REPORT. S ection i.— L inga to B astak, 69 miles. Road is generally mountainous and impassable to guns. It runs through a most desolate country, and is bad, being in its present con dition fit only for pack animals. In many places it runs along river beds or dry water-courses, and would be impassable after heavy rain, which, however, seldom occurs. Water scarce from Meirakum to Khukird, where for 51 miles the supply is entirely dependent on the rainfall, the water from which is collected in cisterns. If troops were to move over this ground, the cisterns should be specially reported on a short time beforehand. Over the remaining small portion of the route water is plentiful. Supplies scarce throughout, as noted in road report. Transport scarce, as already noted. Climate from the middle of November to the end of February is cold and bracing, the thermometer ranging from 76° at mid-day to 45 052 Report of a Journey through Persia. at night.

Water could be also collected in moderate quantities at the two places where I found it en route between Kaleh Bikui and Fadumi. by clearing out the two springs and making dams, for which facilities exist on the spot. From Fadumi to Katru there is a fairly plentiful supply. But between Beshna and Robat great scarcity exists for 48^ miles. I nail probability wells might be sunk at the intervening halting places, where I found them as already noted in the road report. Between Robat and Yezd there is a plentiful supply, except between Merao and Kalweh, where the road is waterless for 514 miles. (Water is, how T ever, obtainable at Chah Mil about half way, and 12 miles off the route to the left). Supplies are scarce en route, Bastak and Furg being the only places capable of supplying even 1 ,000 men for a couple of days. Supplies would have to be collected, the best places being— .. ^ ^ Bastak ' supplies being brought from Lar and the neighbourhood or landed Rlughu Bay and thence brought up. (2) At Furg.

Between Furg and Robat sheep in thousands as well as a few hundred cows could be obtained by purchase, or better still, by the barter of old guns, powder and shot, &amp;c., from the nomad tribes who are to be found in these parts during the cold season. FirewoodReport of a Journey through Persia. 53 could be collected and stored at the various halting places en route by utilising local labour. The general character of the country passed over is desolate in the extreme, consisting of an alternation of barren rocky mountain ranges, between which run gravelly plains, usually terminating at the lowest point in salt swamps. Nearly all the rivers are salty, and the few trees seen are date trees, almond, and pistachio-nut trees. Most of the plains are covered with little bushes on which the camel feeds ; their dry roots form an excellent firewood. Section 3.—Yezd to Samnan. Road, 370 miles (343 direct without counting the detour towards Tut), lies through desert regions; the first 102 miles are moderately level, the pass at Kuh Heriz excepted* and passable, with the excep tions noted, for field guns. In the next 43|- miles, no less than three passes over mountain ranges are encountered, all being unfit for guns. From Anarak to Samnan the road is unfit for guns, owing to the stretches of bad broken ground met with where it crosses the Daramgil, Dom, and Tulha ranges. If these alone were not sufficient, there is the swampy, slippery kavir, which is traversed for 36 miles, in the midst of which two salt rivers are crossed whose SAvampy banks and treacherous quicksands are likely to engulph the unwary traveller. The remaining portion of the road is fair. On approaching and leaving Kuh-I-Tulha it runs for several miles along dry stream beds which would be impassable after heavy rain. Water plentiful for the first 2\\ miles, scarce from there to Ana rak, with the exception of Tut, which has a good supply. Fifty men and 100 camels are the largest party that could reckon on a fair supply throughout. Between Anarak and Samnan, water is more plentiful, but the intervals are longer. Where the road crosses the kavir there is no water for 47I miles, and then only a small quantity is procurable. A fair supply is only reached after a march of 55 At present, be tween Anarak and Samnan, the largest party that could traverse the desert would be about 150 men and 200 camels. There is not water for more. If it were to rain while they were crossing the kavir, the whole party would perish, being unable either to advance or retire. Supplies. None. Improvement of route. —If moving through the country as friends, there is no doubt but that a good road could be made across the kavir » This pass can be avoided by a detour of 2 or 3 miles to the left.- 7 : i r i 11 $ } I 54 Report of a Journey through Persia- by simply levelling the inequalities o£ the surface, when traffic would soon convert the soil, which binds well, into a hard road. The swampy parts of it could be rendered firm by burying bundles of brushwood. Springs at Chashmas, Gauhir, Bulazoon, and Tulha might be cleaned out and dammed up. At Chah Shur and Chahmesh Mus, wells could be sunk, reaching water at no great depths. Water could be brought down to Chah Jangi in abundance by a surface channel from the stream above it 7^ miles off. Thus a very fair supply of water, calculable from the data supplied in the road report, might be obtain able, and the route, with a little cutting and levelling here and there, made practicable for a much larger force. The best time to cross the desert is the season at which I did so. For although earlier in the year a more plentiful supply of fresh water is met with, the road across the kavir would probably not be sufficiently dry. Again, later on in the year the heat on the kavir becomes tremendous, being a good deal higher than 106°, which was what I experienced on the kavir west of Bajistan during June. Requirements for Troops. m Troops moving up from Linga towards Samnan would require at least 3 blankets per man, in addition to which a Cardigan waistcoat, woollen gloves, and a thick woollen night-cap would be required. Ophthalmia is as common here as in Egypt, and sand-flies swarm in places. Consequently a blue veil and coloured goggles are abso lutely necessary for Europeans. A good supply of lime-juice should also be taken, fresh vegetables being but seldom procurable even in moderate quantities. Camp equipage as usual, except more buckets and ropes than or dinarily would be required. Entrenching tools and sand-bags in larger proportions than usual. They would be greatly in demand for clearing roads, making cuttings, sinking wells, clearing out and damming up streams, and making ponds. Mussucks of the ordinary Indian pattern would be required in larger numbers, and w T ould be more suitable than the larger kind usually made in pairs and slung across the backs of bullocks (puckalies). For, unlike the latter, they can be used anywhere, and are adapted to every kind of carriage. I consider that the most suitable proportions for a force intended to operate or move through a country of this description would be One with a small proportion of guns. These should be mountain guns; they would be sufficient for all ordinary purposes. Besides, field guns, if required, would have to move by a better route, where more water and forage would be obtainable.Report of a Journey through Persia, 55 A small proportion of light cavalry, Indian Cavalry, on Indian horses. The country being unsuited for walers, a few good light cavalry would be sufficient for all that is required, which would be scouting, raiding, and pursuits. With regard to infantry, a large proportion of pioneers should go towards the making up of this force, and the Indian portion of it should consist of men accustomed to a mountainous country, and able to withstand the extremes of heat and cold. Here, perhaps, it may not be inappropriate to state that out of all the numerous races and castes of which the Indian army is composed, the ones most feared by the Persian are the Belooch and the Pathan. In conclusion, I consider this route impracticable for any consider able body of troops. It is not a direct one. In many places there is no water, no forage, and no firewood. Troops should move by any other road rather than by this. As regards signalling, great facilities exist. The sky is generally, clear and cloudless^, and heliographic communication could generally be maintained without difficulty by a few stations. As, for instance, Bastak, Hormuz, Furg, good stations clearly visible to one another be ing found within a short distance of each of these towns, the total distance tween Furg and Bastak being 95 miles. A reference to my original maps, on the scale of 2 inches and 4 inches to the mile, will show where stations could be placed approxi mately. From inquiries made while travelling, I gathered that between the Persian Gulf and Yezd, there is a better and more direct route for troops. This commences at the anchorage in Mughu Bay, west of Linga, and runs briefly through the following towns : Bastak, Lar, Darab, Niris. Herat-I -Kharah; thence through Chah Mil direct to Yezd. Between Yezd and Niris this route is fairly level, and is used by large caravans. As this route runs to a great extent through un explored country, it might be useful to have it reported on. I believe also that there is a good road direct from Anarak to Teheran, which does not cross the Dasht-i-Kavir. H. B. VAUGHAN, Lieutenant, Jth Bengal Infantry,Part II.

Commence an easy Gardan-i-Kuh- descent by a camel track 2 feet wide and sunk 18 inches below the ground; the hills on either side rise direct from it; a road therefore requires to be made for guns. At 8| miles the road winds down a narrow water-course amongst hillocks, impassable to guns for 150 yards. It then becomes good, and at 9 miles, leaving the range, it runs over open ground. Down a dry water-course between 20-foot banks; for 30 yards it is impassable to guns, being too narrow; soil soft. Then along the broad gravelly bed of a dry water-course and across a plain amongst bushes and bunch grass. This plain falls away southwards towards a water-course at the foot of the Kuh Angeela. Cross a low hillock ridge and commence to ascend gently over uneven ground. At 114 miles cross a dry stream bed just passable to guns; banks steep and 20 feet in height. A few yards further on pass a very brackish stream flowing from a clump of verdure 200 yards above us on the hill side, then up a hill, gradient I in 7. A new road would be necessary for guns, which should follow the line of the spur from its foot. This would necessitate the follow ing alteration,-and as the soil is soft it could be effected without much difficulty. New R oclx I .

At 2* miles over an immense open plain, which extends to the right away beyond the Kuh-I-Chashma, where it presumably joins the Great Kavir. To the left it extends, I believe, as far as Damaghan. Drainage south. The road still descends gently, passing over open ground covered with tufts of grass and low bushes. The village of Gulaki and the Tang-I-Reshm are plainly visible at the foot of a range of hills. At io| miles cross a dry gravelly stream bed without banks and fringed with numberless bushes of a vivid green. We now pass some remains of copper mines (shallow surface work). The road then commences to ascend gently towards the Panj Kuh. Between 12^ and 13I miles it crosses a number of dry water courses about 3' x 3'.

Leave camp at 5 a.m. by a good road which runs for a few hundred yards along the stream bed, then leav ing it passes over open ground which falls gently from the Kuh Zur range to Turut. The stony plain, which at first is covered with low bushes, becomes barer as we proceed. At ii miles the road runs along in a broad and gravelly dry stream bed without banks, and passes a spur of a peak on the left. At 3I miles pass a hill on the left. At the 6th mile Turut becomes visible on the lowlying ground ahead. An immense flat expanse like the sea is visible beyond it, stretching away to the horizon, without a single hill or undulation to break its monotony. This is said to be the kavir of Jandak.

The road de scends gently over open sandy ground, which is fairly hard and studded in places with little knolls and bushes. Cross a shallow dry water course. At 2\ miles cross a salt stream about 30 yards wide, flowing south into the kavir. This stream drains a large low-lying plain on the left, which is very swampy, and receives the drainage of the hills lying between Chah Furrakh and Rezeh. It is covered with ghez, tamarisk bushes, from 8 to 12 feet in height. On over gravel, and at 44 miles commence to ascend gently over a spur thrown out to the south east by the Kuh-I-Rezeh. The tower and 6-house hamlet of Chashma-I-Safeid are visible away to our left front. Low hills about | mile distant to either flank gradually approach the road. At 9^ miles pass a ruined hauz on the left. Up a smooth and gravelly watercourse 100 yards broad between hillocks. At 14 miles the watercourse is 50 yards wide. Road good, but a little uneven, as it crosses numerous shallow water-courses running from left to right. At 14^ miles the road is 20 feet wide between banks 40 feet high. Descend gently over uneven ground between low hillocks, then over a bit of open ground. At 155 miles cross a shallow dry stream bed, and proceed up a gravelly watercourse 25 feet wide, amongst broken ground, a few green bushes, and occasional tufts of grass about. The road at 16 miles commences to ascend gently, and at 16^ miles enters the dry bed of a river 100 yards in width coming from the Kuh-I-Rezeh and running south-east. Leaving the river by an easy ascent the road winds up and down over gravelly undula tions at right angles to the line of march. At 17 miles cross a dry and stony water-course.■ T 66 Report of a Journey through Persia. 9. Rezeh. I?! —131: ,1 i lev 12' Pass between two rocks 12 feet apart.

It was destroyed by the Turkomans some years ago, when the whole population were carried off into slavery. Supplies—Sheep 20 ; goats 300. The best camping ground is between the chashma and the old village. Water plentiful from a kanat stream flowing 30 feet in 17 seconds, and of sec tion. This stream fills a fair-sized pond which is used for irrigating a few acres of crops. Elevation about 4,600 feet. Estima-ted height of the Kuh-I-Rezeh, 6,000 feet. June nth, —Weather fine. Leave camp at 4-30 a. m. Pass the ruins of the old village, perched up on a rock on the left, then descend gently over open ground covered with herbage and tufts of grass. At 4^ miles cross a dry water-course. Then over broken ground amongst water-courses and little hillocks. Tufts of long grass and big green bushes indicate water near the surface, which is, how ever, probably brackish as shown by salt sweat here and there. A village is said to have stood here many years ago, but no trace now exists. Cross a dry water-course 60 yards broad, and cross its numer ous branches, which are separated from each other by hillock chains through which the road defiles. At 5 miles leave the water-course and march over open ground. At 7 J miles descend into a broad and gravelly dry stream bed, which, skirting the foot of the Ander Kuh, runs north-east into the kavir. Pass long clumps of rushes on the right, then up along the water-course, which is now lined with 14 feet tamarisk bushes. Stream bed 60 yards wide ; a rocky bank on its right. At 7I miles cross /z* a stream of very brackish water, fit for trans- ! j port animals only, of section— &lt; /- 10- / v and flowing 48 feet a minute. Ascend out of stream bed and march along the drainage line of a valley bounded by the long and continuous range of the Kuh-I-Shutur on the left and a chain of low mountains on the right. The ground is covered with good pasturage for camels and goats. At 8| miles it becomes sandy. At nf miles it consists of a fine hard gravel.

Then descend gently along a p 0 ala c n h ^ h dry and shallow water-course amongst low bushes which swarm with '7*—HQ- locusts. At 17 miles leave the water-course, and at 175 miles halt in the desert opposite Chah Palang. Time, 5 hours. Road fair and passable to all arms. But from 4I to 7I miles difficult for guns. Chah Palang is about half mile distant on a bearing of 174 0 , and is hidden away among some low hills. The well is 4 feet square ; it contains 5 feet of water, whose surface is 7^ feet below the surface of the ground. The supply is said to be good and the well to refill rapidly; but when I visited it the water was stinking from the number of dead locusts which it contained. Chah Tusbin bears 340° from here and is 3 miles off. It is an un- revetted well, sunk in a gravel soil. It is circular and 3 feet in dia meter. It contains 4 feet 2 inches of water, whose surface is 16 feet below the ground. It is said to fill rapidly after being emptied. Ele vation about 4,480 feet. June 12th. —Weather fine. Leave Chah Palang at 5-15 A.M. Road good, over open ground ; was travelled over by my baggage as far as 3! miles, while I made a detour to Chah Tusbin, and rejoined the main track at 3I miles, when we proceeded on together. At 64 miles the road becomes stony and much cut up, as it crosses three stony water-courses in succession. It then becomes free from stones. At 124 miles I leave the road and go across country in search of a chashma. First over open sandy ground and then over hard-baked clay which becomes a swamp in the rains. At 134 miles up a dry stream bed, then on between high banks amongst tamarisk bushes, until ,chashma at 16 mile's we reach Chashma-I-Belooch. Capacity 45 gallons an honr. Numbers of long rushes grow here. Every facility for damming up. At 17! miles halt on the road north of the chashma. Time, 7 hours. (I visited Chah Tusbin en route ) thus making the total distance 22^ miles.) Road good and passable to all arms. The country here contains much game.

Time, hours. Road good with the exceptions noted. The name of this place is pronounced Serry Bun O. There are two springs of fresh water here. They are fresh only near their source. Capacity of both 151 gallons an hour. There are numerous other springs, as well as a fair stream, but their waters are brackish. Game abounds on this spot. Many of the ravines in the rocky hills to the south contain grass and small trees, where animals lie up during the heat of the day. There is a good camping ground north of this. Elevation about 3,500 feet. June 14th. —Weather fine. Leave camp at 5-45 A. M. and descend down a dry water-course between rocky banks, which for 20 yards is impassable to guns. Then south along a water-course 15 feet wide, with a hard bottom of sand and gravel between perpendicular banks of conglomerate rock about 14 feet high. At miles leave the stream bed which runs towards the kavir and go across sandy soil over open ground surrounded by low hills. At 4 miles the road [commences to ascend gently over low rounded gravelly hills, covered with an abund- ant growth of bunch grass. Over a level bit of ground formed of hard-baked clay. Frenches dug, and dams formed here and there, show how shepherds obtain water for their flocks in rainy weather' At 4^ miles pass between two low-rounded hill tops, 100 yards apart. Then descend gently over a vast tract of open country. On the right the ground, covered with shrubs and tufts of grass, falls away for about 6 miles till it reaches the kavir, which here is of a dark brown hue. On our left the ground rises in a succession of low gravelly undulations till it reaches a distant range of hills. At 15 miles the road descends over some broken ground on to the kavir, where we halt at 16 ^ miles. Supplies none. Water none. Plenty of withered bushes for fire- wood. To the south the kavir stretches away out of sight without a hill ock or undulation to break its monotony, and a careful examination of the country with my glasses in that direction reveals nothing except a distant line of green tamarisk bushes which mark the course of the Kalmura River as it flows along through the desert to its unknown destination. Elevation about 2,890 feet.Report of a Journey through Persia. 69 June 15th. —Weather fine. Leave camp and march skirting the edge of the kavir, whose commencement is abruptly marked by a sudden fall of about 15 feet in the gravelly bushy plain on our left. At 2 miles strike across the kavir. At 5 miles over gravel and kavir. At 6 miles leave the kavir and march, ascending gently over stony ground, which on the left rises into rocky hills, and on the right ter minates in kavir at about one mile's distance. The kavir in that direction is covered with low green bushes as far as the eye can see. At 74 miles the road runs over undulating ground. At 9 miles it turns north-east towards the hills. At 10^ miles it runs amongst hillocks, and at io| miles reaches a chashma at the foot of a range. Time, 4 hours 21 minutes. Road heavy going from the 2nd to the Abvli'haiy'eT 3 6th mile for guns, and very stony for the remainder of the route. ioi— Passable to all arms except in rainy weather, when a slight detour would have to be made to the left to avoid the kavir. There is a good camping ground between the chashma and the main road, which latter is, however, a mere camel track. There is said to be a shorter cut to this point. It can be made in dry weather from a mountain containing springs of fresh water, 2 farsakhs south-west of Serai Bun Ab. A road is said to run from there straight across the kavir, distance 8 farsakhs. Two springs of fresh water here surrounded by grass and rushes. Capacity of both 221 gallons an hour. Elevation about 3,080 feet. Latitude 35 0 38 / 48*'. During the day it blows a regular gale. June 16th. —Leave camp at 3-45 a.m. The wind has fallen to a dead calm. March south and at 15 miles rejoin the road and proceed in a south-east direction over open stony ground. At 3I miles leave the road and turn towards the hills to visit a chashma which is 1^ miles off, called Chashma Aziz. It is hidden away amongst low hills. Capacity 4 gallons an hour. Leaving it I rejoin the main road after going | miles. This point is 4I miles from Abulhaiyea by the main road. Proceed along the main road over a hard and gravelly soil studded with low bushes, by a gentle descent until 6^ miles is reached, then over level ground till 6^ miles, when I halt on the right bank of the Kalmura River.

It is very clear, but intensely salt, and flows at the rate of 112^ feet a minute. The banks are about 6 feet high and slope gently down on each side of the road for about 50 yards. Elsewhere they are too abruptop ... 70 Report of a Journey through Persia. for an easy passage. The banks are thickly covered with green bushes, tufts of grass and all sorts of shrubs for 100 yards distance to either side. There must be at least 10 feet of water in the river when in flood. The river coming from the north-east flows through a narrow valley between the Abulhaiyea hills and the Kuh-I-Heizum ranges. To the south it runs away into the desert, its course in that direction being marked for many miles by green bushes: 12 or 15 farsakhs off it is said to terminate in a great lake. People living on the Kuh-I- Taurum told me that in the winter time, when the sun sets in the south-west, the waters of the lake are seen glistening in the sunlight for miles. Camel drivers who have lost their camels are said to have some times followed the river's course in search of them and have found it to terminate in a salt lake whose further shore was invisible to the eye. The following notes may perhaps serve to show the probability or otherwise of the existence of this lake or inland sea. I have noticed during my journey through the desert that, in whatever direction I travel, the wind, which usually blows with great violence on the borders of the kavir, invariably blows towards its centre. Gales are of frequent occurrence, and often last for two or three days. When this wind falls it is succeeded by a dead calm. I have frequently seen clouds come up from the kavir against this wind ; they were not dense, but simply long filmy streaks of vapour. The wind is intensely hot and dry. It brings with it a fine dust which penetrates even two or three boxes one inside the other. Dur ing the calms the heat is excessive, and great annoyance is caused by swarms of horse-flies, whose bite is felt as soon as they settle. High ground half a mile to the north and on the left bank, com pletely commands the river crossing and the road from Abulhaiyea. One farsakh north of this, at the foot of the Kuh-I-Heizutn, and on the left bank of the river, there is said to be a chashma called Garmab, consisting of three springs. The water-supply is said to be equal to that of Rezeh. Leaving the river the road ascends gently over hard gravelly soil covered with low bushes and occasional tufts of grass. A few antelope about. On the left the ground rises gra dually for a mile or so, when it becomes broken, and in this condition extends as far as the foot of the Taurum range. At gf miles the road runs over level ground. At 17I miles it runs through high bushes. Descending it crosses a depression half a mile in width with a dry water-course running through it. It then runs over open ground near the kavir. At 22 miles cross a dry water-course and pass over open ground till 26^ miles. 1 he sun now sets, and I wander onReport of a Journey through Persia. 7 1 losing the track. I have not seen my baggage since I left it to go to Chashma Aziz, so I leave off mapping and try to find my camp. After wandering about for an hour or more firing shots, I see a fire burning in the distance, and travelling four or five miles towards it in ,5 - Gil a northerly direction I reach a chashma. 29—226I Time, about lOo hours. Road good until the last 4 miles, when it becomes stony. A spring situated on some broken ground io| miles south of the highest peak of the Kuh-I-Taurum. Capacity 33 gallons an hour. There is said to be a good road from here to Taurum, which is said to be 4 farsakhs off. It passes through the range by a gap to the north-east. There is a good camping ground north of the chashma; soil gravel; plenty of firewood about. Eight miles to the north of this, at the foot of the Kuh-I-Taurum, is a cluster of chashmas, all laid down in the map. The first one passed is dry; the second one is a streamlet of fresh water trickling slowly along the bottom of a steep and narrow nullah. The third one is marked by a clump of fig and pomegranate trees and contains but little water. Leaving this chashma, reach another one about three-quarters of a mile to the south-east—a stream whose capacity is 22 gallons an hour. The water is strongly impregnated with iron. Then march north-east up a dry stream bed until one emerges on to open ground consisting of about 12 acres of good grazing. Then up alongside of a swiftly running stream until I reach Chashma Noori, a small hamlet at the foot of a high peak of the Kuh-I-Taurum, which rises sheer above it. In the hamlet stands a large tree with a stem 6 feet in diameter, whose topmost branches are from 60 to 70 feet high. This tree is visible at a distance iq ' of 14 miles to the south-west.

Water brackish, is 5 feet 10 inches below the surface of the ground and 5 inches deep. Diameter of well 3 feet. It is used for watering cattle. The road now passes over a series of wavel-ike undulations at right angles to the route. At n miles cross a dry water-course 10 feet wide. Its banks require easing for guns ; soil, gravel. Then cross another dry water-course, passable to guns, and another one at 11 j miles. At 111 miles enter the dry bed of a shallow water-course which skirts the foot of a low range of hills on the right. Its bed is about 20 feet wide and sandy; a few bushes about. At 13^ miles over bad ground, up and down across hillocks formed of a mixture of sand and clay. Then cross a broad shallow water-course draining west.

It has an overflow, but the channel is so choked up with weeds that it is impossible to make any calculation. Three quarters of a mile south of this is a chashma hidden away in a sandy depression amongst clumps of rushes ; a few small pools of fresh water about; close by are two other springs; both are now dry. Two and-a-quarter miles south-east of this is a brackish spring, the water of which lies in pools along a sandy water-course fringed with reeds. At 6 A. M. leave camp. Weather fine. The road over open ground is good. At 2^ miles it runs over hard gravel soil. Level and open to both banks for half mile. At 3 miles, after passing a low chain of hillocks on the left, ascend a dry stream bed 40 yards wide between hillocks. Leave it at 34 miles and pass over broken ground. At 55 miles a gentle descent commences down a dry stream bed amongst hillocks 20 feet high. The stream bed is 60 yards wide and consists of hard gravel.Report of a Journey through Persia. 73 At 6| miles leave the stream bed and emerge on to an open plain covered with an abundance of grass, which, during the early spring, March and April, supports thousands of sheep who come here to graze from the neighbourhood of Samnan. There are numerous empty ghellas or sheep-folds about. At 8^ miles the road crosses kavir, through the centre of which runs a dry water-course which flows south-west, and at a distance of 3 miles, entering a narrow cleft between high walls of rock, disappears in the hills bounding the plain in that direction. The road now commences to ascend. At 9 miles it leaves the kavir and runs up a gentle glacis-like slope towards a range of hills. At ni miles it enters a broad gravelly dry stream bed without banks. At i2| miles it crosses a road which is said to be a direct one from Anarak to Meshed. If so, the road proba bly passes through Jandak, running along the side of a low range of hills, or a gravelly ridge which may possibly extend through the ka vir in that direction. At 13 miles cross a water-shed between low hills half mile apart. Road good over level ground; elevation about 3,600 feet.

Road fair throughout and passable to all arms. Fresh water from a rocky basin 16'x 3'. Average depth iG'. Overflow 17' higher up. When emptied it is said to take 10 days before it overflows. Three and a half miles to the west is Chashma Nahani. The standing supply consists of a series of pools whose surface area measures 1,406 square feet. The depth of the water varying from 2 feet to 13 inches. Also a well 3 feet in diameter sunk through rock. The water is 5 feet 9 inches below the surface of the ground, and is 4 feet deep. There is a kaflla here of 20 camels laden with tobacco. It corner from Tabas, and is bound for Teheran. This road is said to be much frequented in the cold weather— as many as 300 camels marching in a caravan. Such a caravan is however divided into portions of 100 camels each, who march at one day's interval and halt independently of each other. I rather doubt this, and should estimate the average caravan at about 40 or 50 camels. T here is a good camping ground for a large force between the two chashmas. Elevation uncertain. I should say 3,300 feet.74 Report of a Journey through Persia. June 22nd. —Weather fine. Leave Dubor at 3-15 a. m. The road is good and runs down a dry stream bed 80 yards broad between hills.

A town of about 1,000 houses, containing a ruined fort and a ruined caravanserai. The Governor is a Naib, subject to the Governor of Tabbas, whose son he is. He is a young man of about 20, and very amiable and civil. The people are well disposed and remember well the visit of the Sistan Mission. They also remember ed the presents which were liberally given. Large quantities of fruit and vegetables are grown in the gardens north-west of the town. Now in season : apples, figs, onions. The crops, 6,000 karwars, consist half of wheat and half of barley; they are insufficient for local consumption. Wheat is therefore imported from Faizabad. Besides the chaudar-shahi several kinds of drab cloth are manu factured. These go to Teheran, Yezd, Kerman, Tabbas, &amp;c., and are much esteemed. There are said to be 50 shops and 8 smiths, also 9 flour mills. Cows 300 ; sheep 3,000; asses 400. Water is plentiful from several large kanat streams, coming from water-supply the Kuh-I-Gurgan.

For the first mile it descends gently until it crosses the broad and gravelly dry stream bed met with during the latter por tion of yesterday's route. The plain ahead is covered with villages, each of which is encircled by a broad band of green cultivation, whilst here and there occur belts of trees. At 4I miles cross a fresh water stream of section 3' x 1' 6', and flowing about 2 miles an hour. The road now runs amongst cultivation and huts. At 5 miles cross a road from Riab (200 houses) to Gumberabad. The village of Rahun (200 houses) is visible on the right, while away to the left appear the villages of Bagh-I-Siah, Dolou and Kaibari. At 6| miles cross a dry gravel water-course and pass along a shady road between high garden walls overhung by clusters of fruit, and bounded on either side by dear streams of running water. At ik miles pass under the walls of the arg, and after crossing a broad stream of fresh water, full of small fish, enter the town and halt at the caravanserai of Jumain. Time, 2\ hours. Road good and passable to all arms throughout There are said to be 16 towns on the plain, the largest of which, jnmam.^ Jumain, consists of 500 houses. It is an unwalled town ; the bazar is 74—291 '92 Report of a Jourfiey through Persia. ■i \ l! f; III H Strategical, very small, consisting of about 30 shops. The caravanserai is a poor one; there are three merchants resident here. Outside the town is an arg or citadel, which, though presenting an imposing appearance from a distance, is in a ruinous state as regards its defences. In it the Governor resides, who collects a revenue of 18,000 to mans from the population of the plain, which is said to consist of 100,000, including nomad tribes, whose wanderings are confined to the plain and adjacent mountains. These tribes possess immense flocks of sheep and goats. There are numerous fruit gardens, and their produce is immense, owing to the fertility of the soil and the abundance of water. The view from the high central tower of the citadel is a striking and most unusual one for Persia. Around the town, for a radius of nearly a mile, are waving fields of golden coloured wheat, which the people are now reaping. Beyond them in every direction is cultivat ed ground on which the young opium lies green. The whole of this expanse is dotted about with walled fruit gardens, filled with large fruit trees, while further still beyond them numerous belts of trees, with domes and minarets rising above them, mark the positions of other towns. At 4 or 5 miles distance the plain consists of an open uncultivated expanse of grass, which extends to the foot of the mountains, appa rently encircling the plain on all sides. At the foot of the hills numerous towns and villages, each in the midst of its own cultivation, are visible through my glasses. Wheat, barley and opium are the principal crops. Twenty thou sand mans of opium are grown here, the bulk of which goes to Yezd. Firewood is obtained from the surrounding hills, and is dear. The climate is said to be temperate and healthy. The rainfall is in excess of that of most parts of Persia. This place is evidently capable of supplying a large force for a considerable time. It would be a suitable point for resting a force at previous to an advance on Herat Khaf or for a force advancing southwards v/d Birjand. The occupation of the points, Bajistan, Jumain and Khaf, would secure the right flank of any force advancing from Askabad or Meshed on Herat; while if outposts were established at Doruna and Zangi-chah, the southern part of Persia would be cut off from the remainder. It seems to me that Russia could with the greatest ease annex Khorasan and obtain an excellent frontier for herself, which would be practically unassailable by us were she to occupy the line ofReport of a Journey through Persia. 93 country just referred to, and that lying between Bandar Ghez on the Caspian Sea and Shahrud. The seizure of Herat would secure the left of this frontier, whose right would rest on the Caspian, while its centre would be rendered perfectly secure by the great natural obstacle existing there, the Dasht-I-Kavir. This route has already been traversed by Khanikoff, and is shown in the Route Book as Route No. 294. It is also shown on existing maps, and I have therefore reported on it, only furnishing such additional information as I consider useful. July 14th. Weather fine. Leave Jumain at night, at 1-20 a. m., by a very good and hard gravelly road, which ascending gently runs over open ground, amongst a lot of villages surrounded by trees, and situated amidst cultivation. The road then reaches some low hills, quarter of a mile, apart, and runs between them. It then descends gent ly over a low ridge, and still descending commences to run through a narrow sandy valley among chains of low hills which connect the mountains on either side. Here the road falls a little steeply, and is rocky and uneven in places, but yet passable for guns. It then crosses two shallow water-courses, both dry, and runs along over an open plain, in what is apparently an open water -course.

Kalat A)i, 15—42^ It is said to be three days longer than that which I am travelling by. There is also said to be a road from Gunabad to Khaf via Kaian, July 15th. —Leave Bimurgh soon after sunset. Time, 11 -23.* Road good ; runs at first through the village, then through cultivation, and over an open plain. At 2 miles it runs along the left bank of a shallow dry water-course, where the soil is somewhat sandy and cover ed with small bushes, which in places grow right across the narrow track. At about 1-15 it passes over and amongst a few low hillocks of soft sand. Road then over a hard gravel soil till 2-37, when it passes through the village of Naudehpeshan (Nau-deh-pesh-ab, the new village near water??) at 6 miles. Naudehpeshan contains about 50 houses. There are three other villages within 2 miles of it, namely, Mausmimbad, Riderabad, and Said- abad. Each village is said to possess a kanat stream of its own, and the extent of cultivation passed through seems to bear this out. After crossing a small fresh-water stream the road runs over higher ground at the foot of a range of hills on the right. It now becomes stony for half a mile, and at 5 -18 crosses two dry shallow stony water courses. It then passes a ruined hauz, with no water in it, on our left. The road now turns to the right, towards some hills of the same range, when I halt at the village of Kalat AH. Road fair and passable to all arms, except over the bushy and sandy tract before Naudehpeshan, where it is indifferent. Kalat Ali consists of a few huts inhabited by Beluch nomads, who own sheep 600, goats 200, cows 20, donkeys 20. Water from a -12 spring flowing 15 conds of section: March ist.- feet in 13 se- --32 5? -At about 12 P.M. leave Kalat Ali. The road descend- gently passes first over cultivated ground. A few small bushes about. At 12-10 it runs over a flat hard plain formed of a dense clay liable to inundation in rainy weather. It is covered with minute cracks like the bottom of a dried-up pond, but is good for travelling over. This is called the Dariya-I-Peshang ; it is said to extend for 20 farsakhs to our left and for 6 to the right.t Deeply indented foot marks show how muddy it can become, though the natives say that it dries in one or two days. At 3' 2 5 we reach the other side, and turning half right we skirt a low range of bushy sand-hills on our left till 3-50, when I halt at a ruin ed circular hauz, whose roof has fallen in. It is 34 feet in diameter, and contains 5 8 of good water. It can hold 12' g' of water altogether. * Chronometer, Calcutta time. t 1 here is no connection between the Lakhi range and Khaibar Kuh as thown on many maps. sies.Report of a Journey through Persia. 95 At 4-15 leave the hauz and march over the same clay tract till ^-55) w hen we leave it and pass through a thicket of ghez or tamarisk bushes, many of which are higher than a horseman's head. This thicket extends apparently for 3 or 4 miles to the left; to the right it extends away out of sight. This place is called the Bagh-I-Baxee. There is an immense quantity of good firewood here, and large stacks of it ready for use are seen lying about. There is an abundance of good dry grass about 6 inches long. The remains of many shepherds' camps show how much it is used for grazing purposes during the cold weather. Water is obtained from wells, of which there are said to be 4, about 30 feet deep. After passing through 3^ miles of thicket the road commences to ascend gently over rising ground to the north of the Khaibar Kuh. At 9-32 and at 9-34 it crosses dry shallow water-courses. It then goes half right up a hollow with rising ground on either side. 3. chashma Road stony. At 10-10 I halt at Chashma Dahna. 18—60 Road good, and passable to all arms. I now suspect that the road which I have taken from Naudeh- peshan ran north of the Ghissar Kuh, while Khanikoff's ran south. South of Ghissar Kuh and 4 farsakhs from Naudehpeshan is a village called Ghissaie, built 10 years ago, and visible through my glasses.

At 12-50 and at 12-52 cross shallow stony water-courses. At 1 a.m. join the main road and go in an east erly direction over gravel soil, road ascending gently. A broad and dry water-course runs on our left; it is bounded by a low and con tinuous range of hills on its further side. g 2g6 Report of a Journey through Persia. At i-12 the road crosses a shallow and very stony dry water course. At. 1-25 cross a broad shallow water-course, very stony, with large boulders about. At 1-40 cross another stony and bouldery water course, also dry. Open ground falls gently away on the left. High peaks of the Ivaibar Kuh are on our right. We now pass a ruin on biastfng! |u ' re t: ^ e 'ght. At 2-45 the road becomes impassable to guns, as it goes down through a rocky ravine for 30 yards. (A cutting through solid rock for 15 yards is here required for guns.) Road then becomes good again as it passes over open ground, which falls away to the left. On the right is a deep ravine, beyond which are rcqufrcs cuuing ^' ie moun tain peaks. At 3-45 a steep and stony descent commences hereforguns. down a bank, which terminates abruptly in a perpendicular drop Rocks require man y fset. A voiding this drop by the light of our lanterns, we turn sharp to the left, and go down through a narrow opening 4 feet wide, between rocks 6 feet high. 1 hen down along a very stony bouldery bed of a stream over hung by trees and bushes, which meet across the road, until 4-15, when the road leaving the ravine becomes better and passes over more open giound. At 4-25 the road is good and descends gently over open ground covered with low bushes until we reach Kasimabad, Road at 2-45 impassable to guns, also from 3-45104-15. A village of 00 houses. Inhabitants, Sunis of the TTaimuri tribe. Supplies Sheep 7,000. There is also a moderate amount of culti vation and several gardens as well. Water, plentiful and ample for all demands, is obtained from a kanat stieam, about 3 feet wide, about 6 inches deep, and flowing swiftly. Close by here is the dilapidated village of Suzano, where gun powder is manufactured of a very fair quality for this country. riiere is said to be an alternative route from Kalat Ali to Kasim- abad. This route skirts the foot of the Khaibar Kuh range to the north, and is said to run over a hard and level plain throughout. It is 2 tarsakhs longer than that which I have come by, but it is waterless. July i8th.-M 11 -30 p.m , by moonlight, leave Kasimabad. The toad runs over the level plain. Soil, fine gravel. At 12-25 cross a l)i oad dry shallow water-course, banks 4 feet high, sandy and fringed with bushes. Then enter the village of Asadabad, which has a very dilapidated appearance. The kanat supplying it with water was choked up two years ago with sand, and has never been re-opened. \\ ater is therefore scarce and brackish, being obtained from wells. Most of the inhabitants have deserted the place. Road then over a clayey plain, said to be a continuation of that crossed between Kalat Ali and (he Khaibar Kuh. At 2-30 pass a hauz on the left of the road full of water and in good repair. The road now commences to ascend gently97 over groundjcovered with low bushes, which gets a little stony. Then up over open ground between rocky peaks of hills about half a mile apart. Cross a winding, very stony, water-course bed three times, the further bank of which, when crossed for the first time at 4-40, is per pendicular, and about 10 feet high (roadway through it is only 5 feet widening for wide). The second time it is crossed, it is the same soil, gravel and gnns ' boulders. At 4-50 cross the water-course for the third time, and pass out of it by a good but stony road. Cross over some low hillocks. At 6 7 pass over level ground. At 6-20 pass a small chashma on the left, and at 6-27 commence a descent amongst low hills. At 7-24 cross a broad shallow water-course flowing from left to right, whose further bank is steep and 9 feet high. At 7-26 halt (and fall asleep). At 8-16 resume the march. At 8-20 pass a small hamlet and a considerable stream of fresh water on the right of the road. At 8-52 leave the low hills, and descending gently pass over open ground till 9-13, when we cross a broad and dry water-course, whose bed is white with salt. Banks easy and slight, consist of sand and gravel. Then on through long lines of trees and gardens till I halt at the town of Nishtafun. A town of about 300 houses. Water plentiful from 5 kanat streams. 5. Nishtafun. There are 17 wind mills here, producing 100 mans of flour each in 12 hours. There [are a great number of najou trees—600 at least. One tree sells for R8. I he wood is used in constructing the wind-mills, which are of a most primitive description. This wood would make good bridging or hutting material. It is said to be 3 farsakhs from here to Rui Khaf. July igth. —At 10-23 leave Nishtafun. Road up a dry water course between sloping 20-foot banks at the back of the wind-mills. Bed stony in places and for a few feet too narrow for guns. At 10-32 the road passes over more open ground. At 11-33 it crosses the road from Khaf to Sangun, which latter is 3 farsakhs distant on my right. At 2-40 the road becomes stony. It then passes a small hauz on the right amd commences to ascend gently towards hills, through which it passes over fairly open though elevated ground ; past a co pious stream of fresh water on the right where there is a hamlet. Then •on through the Dahna Shishab pass by Stewart's route No. 292 to Karat. Road fair as far as the summit of the pass ; it then descends, and in two places runs through long narrow nullahs with high sloping banks on either side, passable to pack animals only. Soil, gravelly : a little work here would make it passable to guns. Fne last 3 miles of this route is down a valley beside a copious stream of fresh water. A mud fort, in good repair, but commanded by high ground at the e. Karat, mouth of the pass within Sco yards range. On this high ground stands an antique and lofty pillar. Water plentiful from a stream and ponds.98 Report of a Journey through Persia. ' f| f Road passable to all arms, with the exception of the two passes noted. J his is the first road that I have yet seen in Persia which possesses sufficient water and supplies for a considerable force. All this country was formerly devastated by the Turkomans who destroyed numerous villages. For instance, Khaibar Kuh was once thickly settled, there being an abundance of water in the neighbourhood. The country is now becoming slowly re-settled. Sections t &amp; 2. Sections 3 &amp; GENERAL REPORT. From Samnan to Bajistan, a distance of 401 miles, the route lies through sparsely populated tracts where water, though abundant enough at long intervals, is yet insufficient in all places for the require ments of troops. Supplies are scarce and totally inadequate to meet the supply of anything beyond the few caravans and solitary travellers who pass this way. The road, though unfit in its present state in a few places for guns, is a good one, and though it crosses several mountain ranges, the ascents and descents are so gentle that they form no serious obstacle, if the passes east of Duzai and north of Chah Pali be excepted. The greater part of the road runs over open gravel plains or along glacis-like slopes formed of the same materials which connect the hills with the kavir. Io the south the Dasht-I Kavir stretches away for miles, and though I examined it with the greatest care and questioned many natives in the hope of finding routes across it, there were only two that I saw or heard of—the route from Yezd to Damaghan via Jandak, and the road I crossed north of Chashma Dubor, which was said to run direct from Anarak to Meshed. The country to the north of my route between Samnan and the Ivuh-I-Taurum, contains, 1 believe, at least one parallel route and several large towns which are not shown on existing maps. For instance, Khar to the north of Rezeh is said to be a place of about 1,000 houses, and a centre of desert communications. From Bajistan to Jumain, 294 miles, the road is good; water plenti ful, and towns and villages, whence supplies might be drawn, are near the route. From Jumain to Nishtafun near Rui Khaf the route appears to be fairly well watered, with the exception of Kalat Ali. I he road is good but for the very difficult descent over the eastern slope of the Khaibar Kuh. Supplies are plentiful between Jumain and Naudehpeshan, but from thence until Nishtafun is reached nothing is obtainable except sheep and goats. All other supplies would have to be carried. During the months of June, July and August the heat on this route is excessive.Report of a Jour?iey through Persia. 99 March, April and May are the best months for movements, when the climate is milder and the water-supply considerably larger. A vast supply of it might be obtained by the construction of dams and shallow tanks, by which means shepherds maintain thousands of sheep for weeks together out in the desert during the spring time, when grass and herbage abound everywhere except on the kavir itself. S ection 5.— M iandasht to B ander Ghez via A starabad. August 28th, 1888. —Weather fine. Leave Miandasht by a good road which runs over a hard gravel plain. At | mile pass through some ruins ; at mile up a broad, dry, shallow-banked and gravelly- stream bed, which runs with us through low hills and amongst broken ground. The hills on the left are low and close at hand, while the high ones on the right visible over low hills are about 1 mile off ; at 6 miles the road leaves the water-course and skirts the foot of a low hill on the right till the 7th mile, when it again enters the stream bed (25 yards wide, banks iS''), which is here joined by another one from the right. Then on, following the main stream bed down a defile between hills 100 yards apart. As we proceed, the bed becomes covered with tamarisk bushes. Then on to a small piece of open ground for 200 yards. At 7 miles halt at a stream ; water brackish. At 8 miles leave the stream bed and go over level ground between hills 500 yards apart. Cross a shallow stream, and at 8i miles go up a narrow rocky passage for 20 yards through a low ridge. A few small rocks require removing to make it passable to guns (about \ hour's work). On by a good road over gravel soil, crossing some low rounded hillocks. At gf miles the road passes through a low ridge, the banks on either hand being formed of red conglomer ate. At the narrowest point the roadway is 6 feet 10 inches, but easily to be made passable to guns. On through low rounded hillocks for a few yards and then down over an immense and open gently sloping plain, until at 16% miles the village of Hounis- toun is reached. Time 4I hours.

At 2 miles pass the hamlets of Hussainabad, 50 houses, and Kala Mugra, 50 houses, half a mile off on the left. Pass 10 acres of wheat culti vation on that side, and cross the dry bed of a salt-water stream 30 &gt;ards wide, with sandy bed and easy i-foot banks. The ground for 50 yards to either side is kavir ; then for | mile over hard clay ; then over sandy kavir till the 4th mile. Cross a narrow, dry water-course 7 feet deep, whose banks require easing for guns. At 8 miles the track leaves the sandy soil, and commences to run over a hard tract of beaten clay, on which water lies occasionally. (Traffic is carried on notwithstanding.) At 9I miles pass through the ruins of an old town built on a gravel soil. Leave them and pass over an open gravelly plain. Koad next over fine sand and clay till miles, when it runs o\er a hard gravel soil. At 13^ miles pass a kanat stream ; water f 1 esh and plentiful; a small fort and twenty acres of cultivation away on the lelt. On over broken ground consisting of clay with a fine surface sand.

Supplies are said to be as follows :—Water and firewood plentiful; cows 100; sheep 20,000; crops 300 karwars ; flour mills 6. At 2| miles low hills begin to approach the road on the left. At 3I miles a road from Bostan joins us on the left. A gentle ascent now commences, the ground becoming stony, as the road leads up alongside a dry water-course between hills right and left. At 4^ miles cross a shallow water-course with stony banks. At 5^ miles cross a dry water-course and pass a brackish stream on the right. On through a basin in the hills | a mile in width, road gravel. At 6.| miles cross a dry water-course with sandy bed. At 7 miles cross a dry water-course 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep. At 75 miles c ross another dry water-course. At 8| miles cross a dry and shal low water-course, and another one at 9^ miles. At gf miles cross a dry stream bed, bottom gravel. At 12^ miles cross a dry water course, bed and banks gravel, 6' x 6' bank's perpendicular. At 12^ miles the ascent ceases, and the road runs on over a low, flat ridge. At 13I miles it reaches a water-shed, estimated height about 8O0 feet above the plain, where a fine view of the fertile Bostan plain is ob tained. Then on down among low hills by an easy road along-side a sandy water-course, until 15I miles, when we emerge on to open ground. At 15I miles a road branches off on the left to Bostan, and a little further on a road branches off to Kerew, a town visible at no great distance on the left. Road now over the plain is good. At 175 miles it crosses a road at right angles to it; and then crosses a copious fresh-water stream. At ig miles a gentle ascent commences.

Leave Kaleh Nau at 6-30 a.m. by a good road which ascends gently over the glacis-like slope at the foot of a high range on our left. At 1 mile a road from Shahrud joins us on the left, at which point there is a tower and a fresh-water stream. At 3 miles the road becomes stony. At 4 miles it enters between hills. At 4^ miles reach a hut, a road branches off on the right to Abre. 6 Abre is said to contain 50 houses, and to possess large crops of corn and barley, 100 cows and 2,000 or 3,000 sheep. Transport 100 yabus. At 5 miles a road from Abre meets us on the right, when the route after crossing a stony water-course turns to the left and commences to run up a valley 100 yards wide. Road uneven, climbs up a steep ascent, cut in the hills on the right. A stream flows beneath us on the left, alongside of which runs a track which branches off over the hills on the left. At 5I miles the road becomes impass able for guns, being too steep and in places too narrow (road 3 feet wide here and there). At 6| miles a road branches off to the right. Leaving the ravine the track now passes over open ground among rounded hill-tops covered with grass. At 7 miles it crosses over a water-shed, estimated height about 2,000 feet above the plain, and commences a steep descent into a valley through dense forest. At ii^ miles it reaches a stony stream bed, flowing north, and proceeds along it amongst piles of rocks and boulders between high and perpendicular-cliffs. The road, which is bad, then crosses the stream five times as it winds along throughReport of a Journey through Persia. 103 the forest. At 16^ miles pass through a small clearing. At 18 miles a stream joins the one we have been following, coming down an extensive valley on the right, which runs north-east and is covered with dense forest. Road now to the left down a valley alongside a stream. At 20 miles the country becomes more open, and there is a considerable amount of rice cultivation about, the fields being enclosed by thick hedges of blackberry bushes. Cross the stream four times, and at 24 miles reach the village of Zaremgul away on the right. Time hours. Road impassable to guns, and very difficult to 4. make passable. This road is said to be blocked by snow in winter. It must also be impassable after the first thaw sets in and after heavy rain. A few irregular troops with good local knowledge should be able to hold the northern wooded slopes against all-comers from the Astarabad direction. Zaremgul consists of 100 houses, built of brushwood and wattled with clay. The inhabitants are a rice-eating race. Its elevation is probably considerably below that of Kaleh Nau. Supplies.—Firewood and water in abundance. Crops about 200 karwars of rice. Cows 150; sheep 2,000 to 3,000. Having joined myself on to a party of about 40 armed men, we start by the route specified below for Astarabad. As large parties of hostile Turkomans are said to be in the vicinity, we take a secluded path, which runs chiefly through forest and skirts the foot of the hills nearly the whole way. There is said to be a better and shorter road across country, which is used in more peaceful times. September 1st. —Weather fine. At 6-25 leave Zaremgul and cross a broad fresh-water stream which skirts the village to the north; pace slow through jungle. At 2\ miles the road improves as it passes over more open ground. At 6f miles pass the village of Kouderabad on the right, said to contain 60 houses, cows 100, sheep 2,000. At ■7 miles cross a fresh-water stream ; water 16 inches deep and 12 feet broad ; banks 8 feet high and sloping gently ; then on through rice fields. At 1 if miles the road still skirting the hills on the left enters a forest, which it leaves at 135 miles, road over gravel soil. At 13I miles cross a fresh-water stream, then on over the open plain amongst clumps of long grass and through occasional belts of trees Cross several small streams, and at 15$ miles pass a deserted village of about 60 houses on the right. The crops are standing ungathered, the inhabitants having fled to the hills- The road now crosses a ditch 25 feet deep and 16 feet wide by a few planks. It then crosses a dry stream bed 15'x 12', with steep banks of gravel, and winds up over a low spur on the left. Below us on the right lies the villagero 4 Report of a Journey throiigh Persia. of Asalarbad, also deserted. It contains about 60 houses. Road now up a valley, crosses a small fresh-water stream.

At 10 miles pass an Imanzadah. Then cross four water-courses in succession, the second of which would be impassable after heavy rain. At 12 miles pass the considerable village of Zungulan on the right and the caravanserai of Shah Deh. The road now enters heavier jungle, consisting in some parts of large forest trees. Cross two fresh water streams, the latter of which has a bed 20 feet wide with perpendicular banks 22 feet high. It is spanned by a single-arched stone-built bridge passable for wheeled carriage. At 24 miles pass another Imanzadah or shrine. Pass the village of Kurd Mahalla, about 2 miles off the road to the right. At 27 miles pass the town of Ghez, consisting of about 500 houses ; a good paved road, 4 feet wide, branches off from here to the left. Pass through more forest, then through cultivated ground, and at 30 miles reach Bandar Ghez or the Port of Ghez. v Time hours, walking and trotting. ^Baadar Gher, Road indifferent, is unsuited to guns; being only a narrow foot path in places, it would be impassable to them after heavy rain. Bandar Ghez consists of a large red brick caravanserai, a Persian custom-house, and about 12 shops kept by Russian Armenians. A Russian Consular Agent and the agent of a Russian steamboat company live at Ghez. At the mouth of the Bay of Ghez is the Russian post of Ashurada, on a small island which has been a Russian naval station since 1842. A gunboat is stationed here. About 2 or 3 Russian steamers call at Ghez weekly. They cannot, as a rule, approach nearer the shore than ^ mile. My authority for information regarding the port is Colonel Stewart. The information gathered en route regarding supplies in places which I did not visit was my guide, who told me that in 1884 he brought a Russian officer from Meshed to Astarabad via Bujnund, Jajarm, and Bostan. He was surveying and noting the number of inhabitants and supplies. Between Zaremgul and Naudeh there is said to be a good and broad road running through jungle via Kourdabad, Doulatabad,io6 Report of a Journey through Persia.

H. B. VAUGHAN, Lieutenant, yth Bengal Infantry,(S&gt; ^ Report of a Journey through Persia. Appendix I. N iris to B eshna. Before reporting on this route, I will briefly narrate how it was I happened to traverse it. When leaving Guloo Kuh, en route to Tul Halal, my baggage, which had gone on a head was looted and my groom disappeared at the same time. The Khan of Guloo Kuh was the man who persuaded me to send on my baggage unprotected, and I strongly suspect that it was he who organized the robbery, and persuaded my groom, a young and good-looking lad, to desert, as he wanted him for unnatural purposes. I may here remark that the Iliyats living about that part of the country are much addicted to this and every other species of abomination. They are a horoughly godless lot, and actually went as far as robbing me, their guest, of nearly all the money I had. On my arrival at Katru, I proceeded to Niris to com plain to the Khan, who refunded me two-thirds of what was stolen. I left Katru by a good road, which after crossing a desert plain entered a broad Katru to valley amongst the mountains. Having crossed the highest part of them, I halted at ''ssauiabad, Hussainabad, where there is a village and a large garden belonging to the Khan of Say ' 35mlles • Niris: it is situated on a plateau. Road so far good and passable to all arms throughout. The next day I left Hussainabad, and crossed the plateau for about two miles, ascending gently by a good road. I next commenced a very steep and zigzag descent down between two rocky mountains into a broad ravine. Road too steep ^r guns, but about 16 feet broad and in excellent order. At 5 miles I reached the evel plain, and at 9^ miles arrived at the out skirts of Niris. Road good and pass- Niris. able to all arms throughout. Guns would have to be led down the pass by hand, 9?—24^. men with drag ropes being stationed behind to check them going too fast. Note.—I could not ascertain the name of the pass I went by, but I don't think it was the Lotras pass, as the natives on my return route told me that that pass was blocked with snow. Azrt's, population, c. —As reported on by other travellers, Fatte AH Khan, a gentleman of about 50 years of age, is the Governor: his jurisdiction extends south ward along my route as far as Guloo Kuh, whilst the territory south of that is under Fatte AH Khan of Lar, and under the direct control of the Naib of Furg. Supplies.—A rough estimate, 1,000 cows, 5,000 sheep. The city contains 4 cara vanserais, the largest of which is the Caravanserai-I-Salbi, and contains 44 rooms. Trade. —No trade reaches here via Bushire or Linga, all comes from Bandar Abbas via Furg. A certain amount passes on from here to Yezd via Herat-I- Kharah. The imports, I heard, consisted chiefly of piece-goods, sugar and tea. Ihe kafilas consist chiefly of mules and asses, also some few of camels. Commumcations. —As already reported by others.—There is a road from here toDarab; it is hilly, and 12 farsakhs (about 40 or 45 miles) in length. Garavans take three days to traverse it. A river is crossed half-way (native information). There is said to be an excellent road from here to Yezd via Herat-I-Kharah; it is also the shortest between the two places. February 18th. —Leave Niris by the same road as I arrived there by. At miles a road branches off on the right towards the hills ; this is said to be the road to Katru vtd Lotras. At 4|- miles I leave the road by which I came from Hussainabad to Niris and branch off to the left. Then I proceed up a ravine by a steep and windmg narrow foot-track, which finally leads up the sides of some lofty hills, and at 6| miles I halt on their summit.

I think the road over the pass is the one which runs to Dehchah and Beshna, and was traversed by Abbot in Route No. 311, for I noticed the very pool of water he refers to from the sum mit of the pass. Hussainabad, vide sketch plan. Water plentiful, from a fresh-water stream. This might be a good place for the encampment of a force intended to guard the passes either to the east or west; it is about equidistant from all of them, and is situated at the junction of several roads. The climate is cold and bracing. No supplies except firewood, which is plentiful. February igth. —Leave Hussainabad and march for Beshna. Weather fine, but cold; a little ice and frost about. At one mile the road ascending gently runs amongst low rounded gravelly hills winding up and down. At 2| miles it passes over the summit of some low flat-topped hills, and descends gently into a valley studded with little trees and bushes. Descent easy. Road good and hard. At 4f miles it passes three wells on its left close to some trees The road then runs along the banks of a small salty stream past low hillocks on the right, which restrict the view. Then at 4 miles enter the stream bed, which is of gravel and 160 yards wide. Road good ; still descends gradually between high hills right and left, which gradually approach it. At 7-J miles pass a well of brackish water. At yf miles emerge from the hills leaving the water-course, and pass over a great plain shaped like a horse-shoe, and open on the right. Road good over gravel soil, covered with herbage, where nomads feed their flocks. At 8f miles cross a broad shallow dry water-course. At io|- miles commence a gentle ascent up to a gently sloping range of hills, the latter part of the road to which leads up amongst hillocks about 60 yards apart. At 12^ miles cross the summit of the range and commence a steep descent down ajnarrow valley, which, however, gradually opens out. (Road here for 300 yards is too steep and uneven for guns.) At 14^ miles emerge from the hills and march, descending gently over an open gravelly plain towards a garden visible at the foot of some hills, At igf miles pass a garden on the right, and proceed along an opening between low rocky hills, It now becomes dark, and we wander along what we believe to be the track, occasionally crossing a drj stream bed, then on amongst bushes meeting overhead by a muddy road, across which streamlets run, and at 23I miles, leaving the low hills', we arrive at Beshna. Road fair and passable to guns, with the exceptions noted. They would also have some difficulty over the last 3 miles of the road. Time, uncertain, but about 9 hours. 1 he country passed over in to-day's march is laid down in St. John's Map of Persia, The accuracy of the map is very noticeable. Appendix II.

Broken ground on the right of a reddish color, and destitute of vegetation marks the commencement of the Kuh I Surrukh (or red mountain); height about 1 ,000 feet. At 4! miles we leave the stream-bed, and ascend gently on to an open gravelly plain covered with numerous shrubs of a brilliant green.

At miles cross a salt river with steep 15 -feet banks flowing south-west . its bed is swampy, being about 25 yards wide, and contains about one foot of water' We then cross several small streams, and proceed over broken kavir crusted in places with salt. The ground is either pitted with holes or broken up into little clumps, which render walking difficult. Vegetation, none. My guide says that this is the ancient bed of the Dariya-I-Siwa, which was navigated in former days by large vessels. We cross several salt streams en route, whose beds, is feet below the surface of the kavir, are composed of solid blue rock interspersed here and there with vertical strata of gypsum. At io| miles I reach the foot of the Kuh Dary Kuh-I-Siwa, when I cross a salt river flowing west. Its bed is encrusted with sue , ' S i wa ' cessive layers of salt to a depth of about one foot; the water is of an intense blue I03 ~ 41 In flood, it would be 10 feet deep and 40 feet wide, but now it contains only a few inches of water. The debris on its banks are broken sticks, dung of hares and other small animals. The ground at the foot of these hills is covered with an abundance of shrubs and bushes which afford grazing to the large wild sheep, wild ass, and other game who come to graze only, for I believe that there is no fresh water here. ^ As I was * coming along I saw an ibex crossing the kavir, probably on his return from some distant spring. 1 he mountains are rocky, being formed of a reddish sandstone which is in most places covered by immense layers of spongy, sandy soil with a salty surface crust. They are much cut up by immense ravines with sandy saltv beds between high perpendicular, and often overhanging cliffs. These hills are, I think, a continuation of the Gugird hills (for when I was rAnin P rI at the foot of the Kuh-I-Gitcha I saw no break in fhe mounlains to ^ and are of a similar formation. 1 here are at least two ranges here to the south nm' n.ng roughly east and west.

When so exposed, the rock, is apparentlf ordinary limestone of a blue and yellow clay colour. y h 2112 Report of a Journey through Persia. Salt-water streams run along the ravines winding in and out of them. In some places after plunging under-ground, and running along through immense tunnels they emerge again on a lower level. On the higher parts of the hills there are level stretches of ground between rocky ridges. Here shrubs grow abundantly, and tracks of the wild goat and sheep are numerous. I saw ravens, swallows, and pigeons. Copper ore was visible in many places. These hills I should estimate to be about 2,500 to 3,000 feet in height. A range of barren mountains, sweeping round in a vast circle from Band-I -Kotal- Husen Num apparently joins the range south of this, which is about 10 miles off. It is impossible to imagine a more perfect obstacle to the progress of an army than that which is afforded by this mass of waterless and impassable hills situated 'n the midst of a desolate swamp. I then return to my camp on the edge of the kavir. May /6^.—Halt; take angles and sketches, and send the camels back for more water and to graze. May xyth. —Search for a road passable for camels across the kavir, and find one. Slight rain last night. May 18th. —Take one camel and revisit the hills, and try to get to theic summit, so as to obtain a good view of the country to the south. I ascend the hills for hours, but am unable to reach their summits.* As I get utterly tired out, one mussuck being drunk and the other burst, and an attack of dysentery coming on, I return to my camp, which I reach at sunrise on the morning of the 19th. May igth. Temperature, mid-day 93 0 ; the place swarms with horse-flies. The only way to get rid of them is, I find, to keep 2 or 3 chickens in my tent, who eat them up as fast as they enter. The evening of the igth I commence my return journey to Samnan, which I reach by the same route in three marches, having altogether travelled a distance of 103I miles. Heie is a sketch representing a curious bird's nest. I only saw two of them. 1 hey were exactly opposite each other on different sides of a ravine, and about 40 feet above my head. T he only birds visible were some large ones soaring at a great height over- head, to which I presume the nests belonged. The kavir and all the adjacent barren.tracts swarm with noxious reptiles and in sects. There are immense numbers of brown snakes about. Their length does not, as a • rule, exceed 3 feet, and when motionless, they exactly resemble a piece of dead stick. 1 frequently met them lying on the track in the day time. One day I noticed one who had climbed up to the top of a small shrub and given his tail two or three hitches round it, and with the rest of his body in a horizontal position remained motionless tor hours. My servants said that he was waiting for a bird to come,and perch on him, when he (the snake) would catch it. The scarabeus beetle also is plentiful. Scoipions simply swarm in places. My servants were frequently stung. I have known two of them stung during one hour. The most curious insect was the ' dumluck,' a hairy, red or yellow-coloured spider, with claws like a crab, I hey grow to a great size, far larger than the one shewn in the sketch. They run very fast, and the Persians say that they are very poisonous. They live on flies and beetles, but spin no web. Where there are shrubs swarms of locusts abound. * Natives say that south of these hills ' Humaduk ust,' i.e. ' It is all flat and level ground, swampy, and covered with sheets of water '; and ' Dariya ust,' ' There is a sea there.'Sketch from Memory of a bird 's nest seen up nea ! • &amp;• of a cliff in the sarae range of hills.

A VOUNG DUMLUCK' LIFE SIZE from MEMORY TReport of a Journey through Persia. Appendix III. The Dasht-i-Kavir. This sketch shews part of the great salt marsh which is said to extend from here to Jandak. It extends northwards I believe as far as the foot of the Kuh-I-Gugird, The hills visible in the distance are either a spur of the Kuh-I-Tulha, or part of the Kuh-I-Gugird range; or they may be a low range south of the Gugird hills. The accompanying sketch does not give an adequate idea of their distance, nor of the bieadth of the salt marsh from north to south, which I estimate roughly at 30 miles.^ 1 he plain, t formed of sand and gravel, covered with small bushes 18 inches to 2 feet in height, ends several miles away in a sharply defined line, on this side of which it presents an almost verdant appearance, owing to the bushes becoming blended in one green mass. As far as this line the ground descends gently. Beyond it lies a level, sandy plain of a brown colour, streaked here and there with patches of salt. Further on, growing damper, it assumes a rich brown hue, which deepens as it ap proaches the central salt expanse. Here it terminates, being bounded by a sharply defined line of salt. Beyond this lies an immense white salty expanse, the glisten from which is painful to the eyes. Here and there upon it lie patches of the most brilliant blue water. This salt expanse does not appear to lie level on the ground, but piesents raised edges, such as molten lead would if run over a hard and perfect ly even surface. The distant hills have a reddish hue,but the bank, a continuation of them, appears to be fairly level, and is apparently a sand-bank of vast dimensions. A peculiar haze hangs over all, which, though blending and softening the features of the distant hills, does not obliterate their details. On the right, a spur formed of kaviry hillocks is shewn; it is thrown out from the KuhT-Dnmb. At its foot runs a dry river-bed, which gradually spreading out loses itself on the immense plain. The kavir shewn in this sketch is called by the natives the Kavir-I-Domb, and sometimes the Kavir I Jandak. Natives say that the swamp has not always been in the same place. They say that many years ago a road existed straight across it from Samnan to Anarak. This road crossed the Gugird hills by a pass, but owing to the swamp shifting, the whole of this route south of the hills became impassable, and being abandoned for many years its very starting point is now a matter of doubt. My guide says that towards Jandak immense stretches of ground bordering the swamp are covered with rushes. The people living in the villages nearest to it noticed that their cattle disappeared dur ing the night without leaving any trace. Accordingly they set fire to the rushes. After the rushes were burnt, they found the body of an immense animal partially consumed lying amongst them. This animal had wings, and round him lay the bones and remains of the missing cattle. This animal they call the ' Nazshdar,' dragon.' Wild camels are said to exist on the borders of the kavir, but I saw none, and no tracks either. Appendix IV. Notes on the road from Hashtadun to Meshed. August 3rd. Weather fine. Leave Hashtadun. The road which is good runs over undulating ground at the foot of some low hills on the right, through which it at lengtn passes, and descends through an open valley between low hills.11 4 After going about 2 miles over open ground we pass the village of Taibad on the left. It contains a wind mill and a fortified mud enclosure. Then on over level ground until the large village of Farizabad is reached, through which the road passes. Then for half mile over open ground, and up amongst low hill chains where there is plenty of water from kanats. It then descends and runs over open ground, and commencing to ascend again we cross a stream of fresh water which supplies a mill close by and halt at Kareez.

Then leave the main road on the right and strike off by a track to the left, which runs over fairly open ground, undulating slightly here and there, where it nears the hills on the left. Then descending into a hollow pass through melon fields and halt at the village of Kuluft. Thirty houses, built 3 years ago. A plentiful supply of fresh water from a stream from the hills on the left. Then on by a good road over level ground, with occasional undulations, until Turbat-I-Shaikh Turbat is reached.

At about 8 miles low hills approach the road on the right which runs along near their base. At about 13 miles pass a ruin ed tower on the right and a little cultivation, also a line of kanats constructed five months ago. Water is obtainable from a flight of steps, which tap the kanat where it runs under the road. At about 15^ miles the road descends and crosses a dry water-course. It then ascends steeply over the low hills before referred to, and descends right into the village of Lingar. ^ This route appears to be separated from Route 249 during the last few miles by a low hillock chain. Road good, and passable to all arms throughout. The coun try appears to be re-populating gradually, but new habitations appear to be erected on new sites in preference to re-occupying the old ones.

At about ii miles a road branches off on the left, and the new village of Feruza bad, about 7 years old, is about half mile off on the right. It consists of a mud fort with battlemented walls, flanked by round towers at intervals. The trace shows that an attempt has been made to secure flanking fire, the gateway especially being thus protected ; a noticeable feature is that the round towers are not battlemented, but are loopholed and surmounted by dome-shaped roofs. There are about 100 houses here, and 50 circular stacks of straw, 30 feet in dia meter and 8 feet high; 800 sheep are visible grazing. Cross several dry and shallow water-courses. The road since leaving Khaira- bad has been much cut up by water-courses, owing to a bad habit the people here have acquired of utilising it as a water-course to convey water to their fields when required. The ground to either side presents no obstacle to the movement of troops except at water-courses whose banks are steep, and where the original road would have to be used.

There are two kareezes here in working order, aud a moderate supply of fresh water is obtainable from them. Reservoirs would have to be constructed to obtain a sufficient supply of water for a brigade, and they would take about five days to fill. Two miles further on a fort is passed on the right, perhaps Faizabad. A line of kanats from it crosses the road. These have been recently repaired and the fort inhabited. At 20 miles a fort is passed, 1 mile off, on the left of the road. Several hundred well grown trees (Chob-I-Safeild) here. Average height 40 sangbas to 60 feet; diameter 12 inches to 16 inches, and 6 inches at 35 feet from the ground. Water plentiful and excellent. GENERAL REMARKS. This part of the country is being rapidly re-settled, villages are being built, and kareezes opened out in many places. Weather at Hashtadun hot and unplea sant for travelling after 10 a.m. Since leaving it the weather has been colder every day until Fariman was reached, and since then travelling in the middle of the day was not unpleasant. I start before sunrise and reach camp before midday. Roads generally dry and dusty. The last wheat crop is being threshed and straw stacked. Melons are in season.116 Report of a Journey through Persia. 1 Stagfe or halting place. i. Sharifabad . Inter medi ate. Appendix V. Meshed to Miandasht. Distance in miles. Description, &amp;c. General Remarks on the Route. 1 took Routes 262 and 391 of Persian Route Book with me&gt; making additions and corrections as I thought necessary. The number of travellers on this route is considered to have fallen off since the construction of the Russian Trans- Caspian Railway, by which many pilgrims now travel, part of their journey when going to Mecca or returning from it ; also a certain portion of the pilgrims from the west to Meshed use the railway. Supplies therefore have diminished, Persian troops marching from Shahrud or Astarabad to Meshed, use the more northern routes; small parties only travel by this one. Between Meshed and Nishapur I passed about 4,000 travellers; between Nishapur and Miandasht about 1,200. Caravans of merchandise were scarce; those of dead bodies plentiful. via Sharifabad. Leave Meshed by a good road which runs over an open plain covered with cultivation; occasional gardens and villages on the left. At about 4 miles pass a caravanserai on the right, and cross a very muddy, though copious, stream of fresh water. Road now over undulating ground until it reaches a small village between two ranges of hills. At 7 miles, after crossing a fresh water stream the road ascends over solid rock across the Gudar 1 Sipah Salar. It then winds along up and down over rounded hills. At about 17 miles the road passes a small caravanserai on the right, and crosses^a stream of fresh water. It next crosses a dry river bed (broad and shallow), and ascending a hollow between low hills winds over and along them until the 20th mile, when it descends over a steep and rocky hill side. At the 21st mile arrive Sharifabad, 409 yards to the left of the road in a hollow, surrounded by low hdls which command it north-west and south-east. About 70 houses; a caravanserai and chapar khana; trees and gardens. Water good and plentiful from a kanat. Road, good and passable to all arms, is in places carried straight up and down over solid rock, where gradients are steep and road slippery. Watei plentiful en route. (N. B. —This stage has been written from memory assisted by page 110 of Route Book.) Leave Sharifabad by a good road over a gravel soil which passes between two hillock chains, then ascends and runs along their summit till at 1J miles it reaches a ruined tower on its left near a tank of water. At this point a road from Sharifa bad hitherto on our left joins us, and a road branches off on the left to Beyand {vide Route No. 80). Road now passes along the foot of a range of hills on our right, the ground on our left sloping away to a great plain on which 6 or 7 large villages are visible. At the 3rd mile the road becomes covered with loose stones which continue until 4^ miles is reached. At Si miles cross a small streamlet of fresh water. Two large pools on left of road. At about 9 miles pass a ruined fort on the left.

At the 15th mile cross a shallow stony dry water-course. At 17I miles cross a similar water-course, and ascend by a good and easy gradient between two hills ; then descend into a hollow, cross another broad shallow stony water-course (without banks). Then on over a low plateau. At 18 miles descend into a hollow and cross a consulerable and swiftly running stream of fresh water; banks slight and easy ; a few huts and trees on the right. Ascend out of the hollow and at 20 miles pass up through some hillocks by a cutting, cross a dry shallow water-course with easy banks, and then go over open level ground crossing an irrigation channel full of water. At 2o| miles the road de scends gently, and at 2!-| miles crosses a fresh water stream. Cultivation about. At 26^ miles cross a fresh-water stream; and at the 28th mile halt at Bageshah village on the right of the road. Lots of cultivation and trees about. Water plen tiful. About 20 houses bere. There are three other villages north of this near the foot of the mountains, and about^ miles off, also a small village on the left of the road. There is a good camping-ground north-west of the village be yond the cultivation. Firewood is procured from the hills to the north. Road fair and passable to all arms, except after very heavy rain, when guns would be unable to cross some of the streams. Time 8 hours, said to be 7 farsakhs. The great bulk of the pilgrims go via Dehrud to Meshed, as that road, though much worse, is better supplied with wood, and trees for shelter. Road, stony over open ground, crosses many shallow, dry and level water-courses (without banks). Five large villages and many small hamlets are visible at the foot of the hills &amp; on the right about 2 miles off. At the 3rd mile the road becomes free from stones and skirts along the foot of some hillocks on the right. At 3! miles it crosses a small fresh-water stream which irrigates trees and cultivation on the left. Road then descends over open ground and at the 4th mile passes the village of Kadam Gah on the right. Soir e fine old fir trees here. Then pass a post-house and a serai, both on the right. The village,_ surrounded by a mud wall with round flanking towers at intervals, is perched on a hill 500 yards to the right oi the road, but it is commanded by a steep and higher hill to the north-east and within half a mile of it. Road, good ex cept for loose stones, is over open ground amidst cultivation. At 5 miles pass a village away from the road on the right. The track, now free from stones, runs over a plain, and at'the' 8th mile crosses a considerable fresh-water stream. At 9 miles it crosses another fresh-water stream. At 11^ miles the road leaving the gravel soil commences to run over a plain which is formed of a reddish earth. At 12I miles it crosses a deep and narrow steep-banked dry water-course, the bank's of which require cutting and ramping for the passage of cf uns . (Soil soft). At the 18th mile pass under the walls of a vil lage on the left. From this point the road lies through cul tivated ground amongst villages till Nishapur is reached at the 20th mile. Road good and passable to all arms. Time 5 hours and &gt;50 minutes, said to be 6 farsakhs. Nishapur possesses a telegraph station worked by a Persian staff. There is a post-house outside the city walls, which latter are much dilapidated. At 10 miles pass the ruins of the Hasanabad village. Water sto far plentiful en route.

The road to the right runs along over a leve! plain, where it crosses a salt stream bed (about 20 yards wide with 1 foot of water in it). Banks easy; soil gravel (impassable after heavy rain). Then at in tervals of about 1 mile it crosses two dry stream-beds in suc cession. (Banks easy;lgravel soil, impassable after heavy rain.) Both of these latter are spannable by single lock bridge. At about 16 miles it reaches the walled village of Sirdeh'on the right. (Sirdeh is said to be 1 farsakh from Zaminabad.) Water from'a kanat. Road then over the same plain for about 5 miles, when it as cends and crosses a chain of low hills passing a spring of fresh water and a pool on the left. It then descends, and crossing another chain of low hills runs along over fairly level ground. At 25 miles reach the fortified village of Shurab. About 60 houses. There is a post-house|here and a good abumbar near a large caravanserai of burnt brick. (The town and serai are commanded north by low hills, and south and west within 400 yards. Water plentiful. Road good for first 21 miles. Remainder uneven. A few rocky bits here and there, but passable to all arms. Route nearly due west. Road good, across a gravel soil, runs over uneven ground, crossing numerous hillock chains and dry stream-beds. After 2 miles it crosses the broad dry bed of a river. At 3 miles it descends over a steepish ridge. At 4J miles pass a spring of fresh water on the left. A few ruined huts here. Then crossing a low water-shed the road descends between two low hillock chains, and passing between two rocky banks, about 8 feet apart, enters a valley | mile in width. At 7I miles it enters a defile by a sunken and indiffer ent road, emerging on a broad gravelly stream-bed which it leaves, and after running along its left bank descends into its bed of running water with rocky banks and lined with tamarisk bushes. Then leaving the defile it passes the serai Kaladar and village of Sangi on the left. A fews trees here. Water in abundance. Road then runs due west down a stony hill-skirt, and at 12 miles passes a ruined fort and brick cistern on its left. At 14 miles it runs over level ground crossing several dry and shallow water-courses. At 17 miles reach the walled village of Zafarani. A good serai and post-house. Road fair, passable to all arms. Route due west across a plain between two distant mountain ranges. The soil is firm and gravelly. At 4 miles pass a line of kanats and the village of Sarlabad. 100 houses 1 mile to the left.

But instead of ' In one hour and ten minutes we crossed a good karez stream of ' read— At 5f miles pass an abumbar built of sun-dried bricks on the right of the road (of dimensions externall 18 feet by 49 feet pro bable interior 14 feet by 40 feet (1) estimated depth about 12 feet. The top of the abumbar is flat, about 8 feet above the ground and is reached by a flight of steps ; it has an all round bullet-proof parapet about 3 feet high.) This abumbar is sup plied with water when required by a channel leading down to it from a Chashma in the hill, on the right (the only water on the road between Mihr and Mazinan). For 'good new serai at Mazinan ' read 'a good serai and a post-house.' 300 houses here. Road good ; passable to all arms. 1 here are 3 villages close together, Mazinan and Bahamanabad and another, numbering in all about 600 houses. There is an extensive plain to the north covered chiefly with cotton cultiva tion. Five large villages are visible to the north within a radius of 6 or 7 miles. Two thousand sheep and 100 cows are visible grazing. Route at first north past Bahamanabad ruins, and the more modern inhabited village on to the corn-fields of Khahk, then north by west to north-west, skirting hills on the right and the edge of the desert on the left. At 3I miles all cultivation ceases, as well as supplies of fresh water which are plentiful up to this point. The road by a good hard and well beaten track 30 feet broad leads across a humid, slippery and saline tract covered with dwarf mimosa, camel-thorn, and reeds. At 7 miles the road leaves the kavir and passes over a hill skirt. Soil gravel covered with loose stones, till-8f miles, when it becomes free from stones. At the 10th mile pass a tower on the right and an abumbar which now contains about 2 feet of very moderate water. Road good over gravel descends gently, and at the 13th mile reaches the village of Sadrabad. A small walled village on the right, and a caravanserai on the left, as a halt ing place but little used, probably owing to scarcity of water, which is obtained from an underground hauz. No cultiva tion. Supplies none. Road now descends west by south across a desert tract of light sand and clay covered with tufts of green vegetation, which, however, is perfectly useless. At 15 miles arrive at the Pul Abreshami, a bridge* of burnt brick with three arches built across the Abresham river (known farther south as the Kal Mura). This bridge is about 7 years old, strongly built and passable to guns. The river, which is now perfectly dry, is generally fordable south of the bridge and immediately below it. The river is about 25 yards wide with perpendicular banks 6 feet high ; bed gravel, with a 2-inch surface deposit of clay. To the north of the bridge the country is very broken and ravine-cut, to the south it spreads out in a desert, white with a salt, which is bounded by a distant Vide detailed report over leaf.120 Report of a Journey through Persia.

Road then over open ground, consists of gravel, but is sandy here and there. At the 20th mile reach a collection of small springs in a hollow close by a tower several of these have excellent ivater. The road then runs over uneven slaty ground till zij mile?, when it passes over gently undu'ating ground skirting low hillocks which are on the nght. At 22 miles the road descends gently into a hollow and then running across it at the 23rd mile reaches the town or Abbasabad. Road good, passable to all arms. Time 6 hours, the town contains 100 houses, and is built in terraces on the hill side. On the_ topmost terrace stands the old walled village ; on the next an irregular mass of houses. Lower down is-a fine large serai, a &lt;- t, ' s an unusua 'y aootl post-house; alonsj the foot ot the hills are many gardens. Water is plentiful, but corn, barley and grass are imported from Sabzawar and other places, 1 he inhabitants here and at Sadrabad pay no taxes owing to the unproductiveness of the country. There is a good road from here to Biarjamand, i stage. PUL-I -ABRESHAM. Pul-I-Abresham. A bridge built of burnt brick of 3 sffkrfg. The parapet is pointed ^ th ' :)r ' c ' &lt;s t ^' s shape. The roadway is paved with \ blocks of blue stone about 8 inches square. This has \ been irregularly done, and the road is consequently } very rough ; the road is 16 feet wide. Althoucft the bridge has only been built a few years it already shews signs of weakness, owing' to the faulty way in which the brick laying has been done. For instance, the two cut waters north of the bridge have separated themselves by about an inch from the rest of the structure, while the central arch has a crack in it. The bridge, however, is so solidly built that it will last for many years notwithstanding these defects ' he river now (August 1888) is dry, but during the rainy season, and for several months after, there is a considerable volume of sak-water.» It the river were dammed up, say, a mile or so below the bridge, the water in its bed would over flow, and owing to the clayey nature of the soil in many places would form a very efficient obstacle. The bridge, and all the intervening grounds, are visible from Sadrabad at the 13th mile, and also from the tower at the 20th mile. People here say that after heavy rain both banks of the river are flooded for a mile or more, and that this lasts for one or two days. Route westerly. Leave Abbasabad, road good, over a gravel soil. At | mile a road branches off on the left over a desert plain to Biarjarmund. At 2| miles pass a tower on the left. A few tiny springs of fresh-water here The road then enters on a rough and stony hill skirt of low slaty ridges, through which it runs gently upwards passing through the roughest bits by cuttings. At 3f miles the road 20 yards wide runs over high open ground, which falls towards the desert on the left, and &amp; is bounded on the right by a barrier of low hills about 1 mile off. Towards these latter the road gradually curves round, and at 4-| miles it descends gently towards them. At4j miles it ascends gently towards them up a very broad and gravelly water course without banks. The road along its level bed is good. At 5 miles the road enters the Dahna Al Hak between rugged hills about 30 feet apart and then winds along up the same water-course by an easy ascent between hills of no great height. At 6^ miles the road narrows to io feet as it passes through hillocks; but 20 yards to the left theie is another * Colonel Stewart says the saltiness of the river is caused by deposits of salt higher up near the river source, where there are saltmines.Report of a Journey through Persia. 121 Stage or halting place.

A few mulberry trees here, and -1 acre of cultivation. I here are several small springs of good water. The road, which is good, consisting of firm gravel, but sandy in places, goes over an open but very broken country. At io| miles it passes through a gap in a low ridge ; then runs over the same sort of ground as before. At 12 miles it crosses and descends from another low ridge, the same as at 6J miles. There is also a double road just here. 1 hen on as before. At 15 miles the road runs up a dry broad gravelly water-course without banks, and then passes over rolling ground (road good), the summit of which it reaches at 17I miles, when Miandasht comes in view, situated on an open, gravelly plain. Then down by a very broad and good road descending over a succession of gentle undulations until Miandasht is reached at the 20th mile. Road good, passable to all arms. Time 4 hours 50 minutes, said to be 5 farsakhs. Miandasht consists of two caravanserais and a post-house; these are connected together by a large court-yard. Water from three large abumbars, one of which contains springs and from which water is conveyed to the others by subterrane an pas sages. There are about 30 resident families here. No cultiva tion. Supplies are brought from Maionai. The new caravan serai (vide sketch plan) is a solidly constructed building of burnt brick. The roof is built of brick and is vaulted. The three outer walls have a 2 feet thick parapet pointed at the top; its height varies from 3 feet 6 inches to 6 feet, and the loopholes, which are splayed inwards, are at various heights from the ground but are all servicable. In some places those marked* are a double tier. On the / v 7v-3 : '-&gt;T north-east side the only parapet is a ' / \ wall 2 feet thick and 1 foot high.

The sur rounding country is very flat and affords no cover, being open to view for several miles all round. The height of the walls is about 21 feet. The weak point of the buildings is the north end, where there are the dilapidated walls of an old mud village, and where no flanking fire can be brought. The lower parts of the ex ternal walls and of inner walls supporting the roof vary from 2 feet 6 inches to 4 feet in thickness. The construction of blocks C and D is similar. The old serai is equally, massive, but its roof has only a low sur rounding wall 1 foot high and 2 feet thick. Miandasht is situated at the junction of several roads, namely, the two roads from Astarabad, one md Abre Kuh, the other ■via Shahrud, and the road from Khan-1- Khudi, which pro bably runs on to Turut.122 Report of a Journey through Persia. Appendix VI. Notes on Transport. Persia being a country in which metalled roads or laid down tracks of any de scription are almost unknown, where bridges are scarce and many of the main lines of communication consist simply of a track worn in the ground by incessant traffic, it follows that wheeled vehicles are but seldom seen, the country being as a rule unsuited for such a mode of conveyance. The traffic, therefore, is carried on entirely by means of pack animals. Between Linga and Forg, where the country is mountainous, asses are the principal beasts of burden, a few mules also being employed. North of Furg on the better roads, the transport consists chiefly of camels, while a larger ass than that seen at Linga is used. Between Yezd and Sam nan mules are but seldom employed, the country being suited only to camels. The same also applies to the desert route from Samnan to Bajistan. Fodder and grain are scarce and insufficient for the supply of from 50 to 100 mules. The Linga ass travels at the rate of from 2| to 2f miles an hour. He carries half a mule load. They are fed on dates instead of grain, and for fodder eat kar or chopped straw. All animals are fed twice a day. A morning feed before marching, and another about sunset. But kar is given them during a halt of any length when en route. The yabu or country horse is employed in the north as a beast of burden. There is but little hay or dried grass in this country {i .e., where I travelled). All animals, except riding horses which were fed on the former, eating kar, which is obtainable wherever crops of wheat or barley are grown. Throughout the country, except on the Kavir itself, there is a fair amount of grazing for all animals during the spring time and early summer. It is usual after a march to loose the animals for two or three hours grazing. Camels as a rule travel only at night. During the day time they remain out grazing. Mules, yabus, and asses are either driven in a herd or in single file chained together. Camels are led by a rope. The rope of each camel's head-stall being tied to the next one. All the ropes are made of goat's hair, which is strong and wears well. Head-stalls are made of plaited goat's hair. The leather obtainable for harness in this country is generally thin, weak, and of very inferior quality. Pack saddles are made of a coarse sacking, being stuffed with straw and lined with nummuah, every quality of which is largely manufac tured, and is obtainable in any city in large quantities. Appendix VII. Means of obtaining Water. Water. In many parts of Persia, the only way of obtaining water is by cisterns called in the s6uth ' Bourkahs,' or ' Birkhas' and in the central and northern parts ' Hauz.' These cisterns or tanks are generally constructed near the foot of a range of hills,' or in a depression of the ground where the rainfall from a considerable surface can be collected, care being taken to avoid salty ground which here is frequently met with.Report of a Journey through Persia. 123 It is necessary that the tanks should be roofed, as it is found that water in open tanks goes bad, owing to the heat of the sun and dust-storms, which between the fill up the tank and foul the water in a very short space of time. Evaporation has also to be considered. When it rains, the water is collected by means of a number of small channels on to an open bit of ground in front of the tank j there it is allowed to remain until most of the mud has settled, when the dam being removed it flows into the tank comparatively pure. Notwithstanding this precaution, however, a deposit of mud, varying from 1 to 3 feet in thickness, is often found at the bottom of a tank in one season'- hence the necessity for constantly cleaning them out. The period for this varies from one to three years, according to the nature and firmness of the surrounding soil. Tanks which lie away in the desert, far from any human habitation, are usually filled with rain-water which has not previously been allowed to settle, and consequently they get choked up very rapidly. One or two large bourkahs at a halting-place on a trade route will often supply the whole of the traffic with a day's water from one rainy season to another. From the foregoing it will be seen how the supply available from them depends on the ever varying state of the annual rainfall, the cleanliness of the tanks, their state of repair, the time of year and the amount of traffic which has already passed ; and, consequently, how absolutely necessary it is, as regards military movements' that accurate information regarding their condition should be obtained but a short time beforehand. ' Kanats' or ' The supply from these, as a rule, is fairly constant, but in cases of pestilence, famine, or other disturbing causes, when the whole of the population depending on them for their Water -supply, may have deserted the neighbourhood, they are liable after a short period of neglect to become choked up, either altogether or to such an extent as may seriously curtail the supply available. The construction of kanats entails an immense amount of labour. The mode of operation is as follows. A likely spot for water is selected and wells are sunk experimentally, until a subterranean stream, or a sufficient volume of water, is reached. Sometimes a dozen or more wells are sunk before this result is attained. The kanat is now commenced, say, from the site of an intended village several miles off, to which it is desired to convey the water. First, a cutting is commenced and carried towards the well as far as it can conveniently go, and the sides will stand. When this is no longer possible, a tunnel or gallery of sufficient height and width to enable a man to work in a crouching posture is constructed, and as soon as this reaches a length at which it no longer becomes convenient to brinf the excavated earth back to the surface through its entrance, a shaft is sunk from the surface of the ground to meet it, and the excavated earth is brought up through it by means of a bucket and windlass. The tunnel is then prolonged again until another shaft becomes necessary : this process is repeated as often as required, the tunnel ascending all the while on a nicely calculated gradient, until at last, perhaps after a length of several miles, it strikes the well first made, when the stream flows through it down to the desired spot. These kanats are, as a rule, cleared out about once a year, when an entrance is gained by a man descending one of the shafts. Some kanats in a hard soil do not require much cleaning; in this case the shafts have a small domed roof built over them some few feet below the ground, and the soil is filled up over it level with the surface.124 Report of a Journey through Persia. Where the soil is soft, the kanats are lined with pipes made of burnt clay, which, when once placed in position, are practically indestructible. Some kanats after flowing on the sur face for a period, are again carried below the level of the ground, where they are reached by long flights',of steps, perhaps in the centre of a city, as at Yezd. Streams. — Many streams, brackish at a short distance from their source, will there be found to be perfectly fresh. Water in this country often derives its saltiness from the ground it flows over.
