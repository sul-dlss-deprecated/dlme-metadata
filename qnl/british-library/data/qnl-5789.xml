I have the honour to forward copy of the marginally noted letter which &gt;T ^ • , , nn/1 ... I have received from the Political Agent, enclosure. Koweit, proposing the erection or a ^ beacon outside Koweit. Before submitting the proposal to the Government of India I asked the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, for his views. Commander Bowman considers that Bas-ul-Arz is the most suitable place for a beacon, and states that “ the proposed type (of beacon) should answer the purpose admirably.’* A mark for ships entering Koweit harbour is very necessary, and I venture to hope that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction a special grant of Bs. 280 at an early date so that the work may be taken in hand as soon as possible. No. 80, dated the 15th November 1904. From— Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the erection of a signal on the B.as-ul-Arz which Captains of the British India steamers visiting this port have informed me will supply a long-felt want. 2. The British India Company have erected one there already, but it con sists of a long pole with cross bars at the top and is too slight to be visible at any distance. I may add that on my visit to the spot last Saturday, it was not easily seen at the distance of a mile. This was on a clear day. A slight haze obscures it completely. 3. I append herewith a sketch drawn to scale which I drew with the assistance and advice of Captain McLean and later I showed it to the Captain of the S.S. Kangra&gt; who said that it was all that could be desired. 4. Both stone and clay are readily obtained in the neighbourhood of the site which materially reduces the expense. The portion marked stone would be made of the ordinary rough hewn stones obtainable in the neighbourhood mortared with moistened clay. 5. The discs would be of deal with slits cut thus ^ and would fit into each other and present a spherical appearance from all directions. The entire structure would receive a coating of tar. 6. I also attach an estimate of the cost which has been worked out as carefully as possible in accordance with local prices, allowing for, the distance, 6 miles, of the work from the town. On account of the experimental nature of the work, a liberal allowance has been made for unforeseen expenditure. 7. For maintenance expenses little would be required beyond a coating of tar yearly and the occasional renewal of discs. Rupees 20 per annum would thus probably suffice, but I should prefer to reserve this point for sub mission after the erection of the signal. 8. I would request that the favour of the necessary sanction to the expend iture may be obtained. The work could be completed within a month of receipt of sanction.Copy of a letter l T o 633-F B dated 13th February 190 F from the Assistant Secretary to the Covernment of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta, to the Political resident in the Persian OulJ\ hi \ I, am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your i z% letter Do 32, dated the 22nd January 1905, recommending the erection of a beacon outside Kowe it . 2 .

I would express my regret that I did not consider it necessary to explain that I had consulted the Sheikh on the project. My reason for this was that it is merely a question of improving an already existing land-mark erected with the approval and consent of the Sheikh. 3. As a matter of fact, on the occasion of my visit to the spot, the Sheikh was good enough to supply me with one of the younger members of the Subah family and two sowars as an escort and was throughout fully cognisant of and approved the proposal which had been discussed between us. 4. In all such matters tending to the safety of navigation I am happy to be able to say that I can rely on the enlightened support of Sheikh Mobarak. 5.

I am to explain that the beacon was designed to serve as a mark for ships entering Koweit harbour, and that the pro posals for its erection were originally made by the Political Agent at Koweit at the instance of the Commanders of the B.I. steamers visiting that port, who considered that it would supply a long-felt want. The Senior Naval officer, Persian Gulf Division, who was consulted on the subject stated that, in his opinion, Ras-ul-Arz was the most suitable place for a beacon and that the type of beacon proposed would answer the purpose admirably. 3. With reference to the proposal, which has now been made, for lighting the beacon, I am to say that, as it was no part of the original scheme that the beacon should be lighted, the Government of India would be glad to be informed whether Your Excellency considers it necessary or advisable that a light should be displayed and if so whether in your opinion the pro posed arrangements for lighting are adequate and suitable. I am also to request that the Government of India may be favour^ ed with any remarks, which may occur to Your Excellency, on any other aspect of the question. ance and light-M 4 (Copy' C0NFIIE1TTIAL. No 1462—VI Royal Naval Camp, RiyaNalawa, 9th August 1906. Sir, \ n' With reference to your letter No 23J37 E.B., of the 6th July 1906, I have the honour to report that I consider it ad visable that a light should he displayed on the beacon on Ras- ul-Arz Promontory near Koweit, but I do not consider the pro posed arrangements quite suitable. 2. It is proposed to use two masthead lights. If this means two ordinarjr steamer's steaming lights, I do not consider the arc of visibility would be large enough. It is necessary that the light should be visible over an arc of at least 25 points to show from the bearing of North by East, through North, West and South, to the bearing of ESE. 5. This would cover the anchorage, from which the light should be visible for the use of vessels leaving the port at night; and the coast to the Southward. 4. An all-round light would probate be the most suitable; but, with a light on Ras-ul-Arz)to allow vessels to enter at night, I consider it is necessary that there should also be a light near the anchorage, as ships entering on a dark night tkeiy would then be enabled to take up anchorage with safety. 5. A light at Ras-ul-Arz would be no guide when the anchor- tke age was reached, and taking into consideration strong tides that run across the anchorage, I consider a light there to be as necessary as one on the Ras-ul-Arz. 6 . A light on both or one of the buoys marking the anchorage if they could be depended upon, would be the most suitable from a navigational point of view; but it would probably be less expensive, and not so troublesome, and prove more re liable to have a distinctive light (red fixed) hoisted at or near the British Residency flagstaff. This should meet all requirements. In view of the possibility of the port of Koweit increasing in importance and becoming, in the not very distant future.(Si 'S 4 &lt; _ , . I future, the outlet for a considerable amount of trade, and the advantage|wh.ich may be derived from having entire control over the lighting of the port, I think that when the possibil ity of the port being much used appears near at hand, it would be well to consider the erection of a light further out to seaward than the Ras-ul-Arz. 7. There is a considerable amount of danger to be avoided before the Ras-ul-Arz can be sighted, and I am of opinion that a light on Kubbar Island would be a great boon to vessels malting Koweit, although perhaps at present it would not be justifiable on account of expense. 3. The policy of our having control of the lighting of the port of Koweit appears to me to be sound and to add to the advantages we already possess by our confidential agreement with Sheikh Mobarak.1 The Political Agent, •Koweit, Sir, sb hith reference to your letter llo.392, dated 7 th October 1900,1 have the honour to inform you that it is doubtful whether Government will sanction re-appropriation from grants for initial expenditure, and that it is irregular to re-appropriate salaries from contingent grants, I would therefore suggest that you will submit during December frbft probable savings under the proper heads, in conformity with the instructions contained in Articles 158 and 1G0 Civil Account Code, / I have the honour to be.

There should be some reduction here but I have allowed the original estimate to stand, as I anticipate that in era No. 7 will nrove more costly than estimated for, 7 # Item No.3 will also, it is to be hoped, show some reduction in expenditure in consequence of the reduction in the length of the iron spiral stair- -case from 38 feet to 37 feet, I have allowed the original estimate to stand,as the alteration is a trifling one and as already stated, more money will be required for item No,7. g m Ror items Nos,4, 5 and 6 please refer to Messrs aiehardson and Oruddas* letter.There has boon no alteration in these three items.This firm has been most obliging in assisting me with advice and I have found work done by them to be both good and reliable,so that I hone,if my proposals be approved, that the contract for the work covered by their lett- -er t,letter be entrusted to txiem for execution* Item Ho*7 has been calculated for ? £ on the info mat! on for which I am indebted to the xindnesa of the Director, Royal Indian IIarilne,Bombay, .. •» -...A . -&gt; -v. - - .

All the previous corre ipondence spoke of a Dioptric light of the 4th order. As the Raa-ul- Ara lighthouse is only a part of the more ambitious sch/ems for connecting with iinbbar island and as the difficully of the flagstaff is obviated by the present proposals which I have the honour to submit, I would suggest for your consideration whether it would not be advisable to refer the question again to the India Office pointing out that there will be a roomy 1 -antem house of 6 feet diameter and'that the -weight of the lantern need not be considered as a disturbing factor in the problem* 10 . file question of the plate glass might also be referred to the same authorlty.lt will be noted that Messrs Richardson and Oruaoas do not coiiimit themselves definitely as to the cost*As to dimensions, the plate-glass is 6 feet iiign and curved to fit to a hollow cylinder S' feet dimaeter.fhe mem «b©r of panes would probably be each f feet &amp; high and approximate length ft feet but in this matter I am writing in the dark* 11 . The remaining items of the abstract referred to call for no special remark* 13. A very important question is that of recurring expenditure .With regard to oil, cleaning 1907,1 would only point out that the last paragraph -• apparatusapparatus and miscellaneous expenditure , it would urobabl: oe sui. licient to allow for a'contingent expenditure of iisl 5 / per mensem. For repairs t&gt;o uhe building, one should allow an expenditure of Bs. .800/- per annum looking to tne #*** U oost of the building. A good large flag which could be semi from the town ox Koweit tobe hoisted on the approach pf a steamer would be a desideratum but for this it. would only be necessary for the Political Agent to increase his indents and the allotment is sufficient to meet the cost. 13 • A11 the above is comparatively plai^ sailing but if is with regard to the establishment that I feel very strongly the need of expert advice. I would recommend the retention of • m . , x Bedouin watchmsui h- - should be raised in my opinion to ?s 87/- per mensem the equivalent of dollars 15.

It would seem advisable to have at least three men for this duty to allow an ample margin for sickness and leave and, as far as my experience goes, a low caste Indian can be moderately contented here on about, as. 30/- per mensem, but I think ary Indian employ - —el in such a sost should have his Indi an P: y raised b^ 50 per cent. Quarters for them could be built at a cost of Bs. 600/-. ^^• fhere is, however, the question of their protectimv ana, in the event of trouble, itm/ould be some satisfaction to have Arabs there who would look after themselves* fown bred Arabs would have to be very carefully selected, trained atit - j at the Agency and their pay would havo no oe xixert at iflSO/4* per raensera at the very lowest figure. The quarters under this seheaie would be the sfuae. 16. To sua up the last two paragraphs, Indians would be found ehear, trained, disciplined : and careful but hoiae- —sick and might be in danger# Arabs would be found costly, apt- to quarrel among theoiselves to the detriment o i the smoot h vforking of i he scheme and would have to be train© I.

I am directed to address the Government of India, regarding the improvement of the lighting of the Koweit harbour. 2. accidents to Merchants vessels have recently taken place off Ras-al-Arz, the point which has to be cleared before Koweit harbour can be made. In 1913 the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer 'Putiala' ran aground at this point, and in De- -sember last another vessel of the same Company, the S .S.’’Kasara” , met with a similar accident at the entrance to the harbour. To avoid the repetition of such occurrences in future the Port Officer, Bombay, has suggested to this Government the necessity of placing a small ]&amp;ax light on the beacon which exists on this point in order to assist masters of vessels in making the harbour with safety. The Director of the Royal Indian Marine, who was consulted, recommen -ds that as a temporary measure a Marine Pattern No. 3725-A mast- -head steaming light, costing Bs.70/-, should be placed on the pre- -sent beacon, Inxmaking and that arrangements should be made with the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, for the care and maintenance of the light by the caretaker at present in charge of the beacon. In making this recommendation the Director refers to Mr. Hood's report on the proposal to build a lighthouse at Ras-al-Arz and urges a reconsideration of that gentleman's proposals in view of the rapid development of the Gulf trade which may be expected in the near future. I am to enclose herewith a copy of the report for the information of the Government of India. 3. In submitting these proposals I am to suggest that, pending the consideration of the question of constructing a new light, the Director's proposal to place as a temporary measure a steaming light on the Ras-^-Arz beacon may, in view of the require -ments of navigation and the smallness of the expenditure involved in carrying out the work, be sanctioned at once.

It is apparently constructed of an outer shell of stone covered with plaster and filled in with pebbles, etc., and is v... cracked in several places. It is, m ny opinion, liable to collapse at any time, and I do not consider it possible to repair P^ope^ \jj. jliout almost entirely demolishing it f^rst. In view' of the very considerable -expense which this would entail owing to the greatly increased cost of labour and material, 1 would suggest that the proposal for the construction of a perma nent lighthouse be again put forward noxv, if it be considered de sirable to do so at all in the near future. 1.x this be considered undesirable at present, I should, if possible, like the advise of an engineer as to how the existing temporary beacon can be most economically and effectively repairedTo llo.zxcj- S Of 1920. ,ritish Residency and Consulate-Goneral, Bu. shire, 21st July The political Agent, Koweit. / Sr 14 Sir, I have the honour to aclrnowledge receipt of your letter no.501 dated 1st July 1920 regarding the beacon at- Ras al Ar^. 1 have consulted Hr* Crossle the new Execubive j.ngineor, public Works Donartrnent,who has taken over charge of tne Lighthouse work in the Gulf, and he cannot trace any de finite proposals with plans and estimates etc raving ever been submitted. He has gone to Karachi to arrange about increase of staff of his appointment, which has been changed from 'Assistant Engineer Persian Gulf Sub-Division' bO Exe cutive Engineer Persian Gulf Division'. On his return after he has got some urgent work at Bahrain started I will ask him to proceed to Koweit. In the meantime I will consult the Commanders o bhe 'Lawrence' and 'Hearchus' as to the necessity of a Lighthouse. I fancy that a mast-head light on the beacon combined with the light on the Agency flagstaff answers every purpose having regard to the limited number of vessels which ever wish to make Koweit at night.

You will see it amounts to Rs.23,144/- and I doubt if it is worth while spending so much money on a light into Koweit harbour as so very few vessels have occasion to maKe the place at night* I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the Commander of either 'Nearchus 11 or “Lawrence' as the former has been in Bombay having a refit and tne latter absent from Bushire on various duties.

Prom proceedings of Court of inquiry subsequently held ; &gt; ' : . . V it appears that Pas al-Ardh Light was not lit until 7 P.M. (1.40 Arabic) and that this fact contributed to the accident. Please ask Mazy ad for an expiarultion and post full report, 4. \ . / /Mazyad was called and aslced aljout the light on the 19th January 1936. lie states :- I lit the light at 11.45 Arabic time on that • ■ I ’ \ ’ .

From Shuaihah she was coming towards Has .al-Ardh in a eomsterly course very near the shore. From her position inside the curve she could not have possibly seen the light &amp;.&amp; the light is shaded on that side. Realising , this I put up an ordinary hurricane lamp at about ^ .50 O’clock Arabic time to enable the Tanker to see • * . the position of the Has al-Ardh light and kept the lamp the whole night. I can cite witnesses to bear out my statement that the light was lit on that particular evening at the usual time. Nakhuda Ahmad bin TuwaIrish and his brother ’All bin Tuwairlsh, ’Abdur Rahman al-Majid, Faiah bin Sahalyib, Muhammad bin ’Abdul ’Afeiz al-Majid and ’Abdullah bin Raiyls, all of Kuwait, were there v • ' . : . that evening on a picnic party. ’Abdullah bin Mandil and others of Has al-Ardh also^that.

Recorded by “Head Clerk, Political Agency,Kuwait. i 'yP.1, On Itim moelpt of your telegram aToout the Tanker I went to Ras al-Ardh and asked Maayad for his explanation. I told him to oome to the Office next day. His atatement which is a mere repetition of what he told me the previous day is submitted herewith. He called six witnesses to corroborate his statement. I sent for the witnesses hut could get only two whose statements are also submitted, the others having left for pearl fishing. tt appears from the statements that th© light though it was burning was not probably visible from the Tanker whose people might have mistaken the lantern put up later by Massyad as the Beacon Bight. If the statement that the tanker grounded ' near the curve beyond Ras al-Ardh as Masyad and his witnesses state is believed in I venture to think that the Light, although it were lit at the proper time, would not have been visible from the Tanker*s position owing to the fact that it is partly shaded in that direction.r Telegram (Code) J roin Mo re, .(Mai o r J .

Heference the allotment of Is. 400 per annu$ aanotioned in 1915 for the maintenance of the lao-al Arm Deacon. The caretaker of the ‘beacon haa up to the end of Oecemher 1919 been paid at rate of Bs. 30/- mensem. He has 'been for a long time complaining of heing unable to live on this wag© and has now intimated hia intention to resign if he does not get sufficient I to support himself and his family. I propose that he should get Bs. 50/- p.m. At the present time a hag of rice costs Bs. 35/- and other accessaries are equally expensive. It Is clear therefore that the wage of &amp;&amp;. 30/- is an abac- ^ lutely absur on© at present day cost of living. Besides this the cost of oil has gone up considerably. I request therefore that sanction of th© Govoramen ( of India may be obtained to raise th© allotment to Bs. 700/- per annum with effect from 1st January 1920. ■ \ fl This will allow a wag© of Bs. 50/- p*m. to be paid to the caretakei? and th© extra Bs. 100/- will be required | for lighting.'
