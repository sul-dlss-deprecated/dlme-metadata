BAHRAIN STATE . Subject: ZUBARAH, Previous correspondence on file 4/13-1 Later correspondence on file 4/13-III From June 1937 to July 1937•ATranslation of letter dated 29th. Rabi Awvval 1256(9.6.37) from Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim al 'Tiiani, Ruler of Qatar, to Captain T.Hickinbotham, Political Agent^ Balirain. After Compliments. I have the honour to bring to pour kind notice the question of Zubarah. I have repeatedly pointed out to you my difepproval of the encroachment done to us by the Bahrain People by their imaginary claim vhich has neither set upon a foundation nor is according to any rule of intellect and logic. This is the claim which they created about Zubarah which is my lend and one of the Qatar Coasts. You asked me Then you visited Dohah to send two representatives in order to negotiate and investigate the case of Zubarah with the representatives of His Highness the Raler of Bahrain. I was quite certain that there was no necessity for negotiation in a clear matter but I c.ould not disagree with your wishes. And in accordance with your desire, 1 sent my two representatives to Bahrain for negotiation under your supervision. My representatives produced evident proof that Zubarah is an inseparable part of Qatar territory. In conclusion proposals were put forward by the representatives of His Highness the Ruler Ox Bahrain to which form 1 could not agree as I considered it the very claim created by them, but being anxia to preserve the friendship existing between me aid His Highn ess the Ruler of Bahrain and in order to strengthen the neignoourly relations I inserted certain modifications and submitted them as explained to you in the modification. I pointed out to you and I also wrote to the Honourable the Political Resident that that was the extreme limit possible for the agreement but I learnt that the representatives of His Highness are adhering to their own views and still want to encroach upon my right, attempting tc cut a part from myI If I i . .. © - 2 - land and a coast from my coasts. I am certain that my proof is clear even to the High British Government because demarcation took place long ago and this fact is known to the High British Government since the time of their treaty witl the Bahrain people and the grant of protection to them over their frontiers. There is no doubt they know that Zubarah has no connection with that. The High British Government also granted us protection, over land and sea of the whole Qatar without exception and recognized the independence of all Qatar territory 'under my Kuling Flag. Is it possible that the High British Government had any doubt about Zubarah when they granted me protection and did not make it clear to me or drew my attention to it. And lately negotiations took place between me and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited for a survey of the whole Qatar territory, its lands, boundari and coasts and for the exploration of oil there. An agreement v/as concluded with the Oil Company in this connection with the assent of the High British Government. The survey in question was carried out by the said Oil Company on all Qatar lands, Zubarah etcetera and a map was drawn covering all these areas of Qatar territory including Zubarah. Tvps was going on for some years during which period the negotiations with the Company were concluded with regard to oil development in all the places in Qatar as shown on the map. As I saw that that was in accordance with the views of the British Government and was accorded with their approval, I agreed to the terms of the Company and signed the concession accordingly xor the said company as laid dorm in the agreement concluded oetween us. All these were carried out under the supervision and the consideration of the Bepresentative of the British Government in the Persian Gulf. This cane into effect after it had been countersigned by the Representative ox the (Dl*- 3 - High British Government \fnieh was concluded covering the whole Shaihhdom of Qatar including Zubarah in accordance with the plan attached to the agreement. The Representative of the High British Government made the countersignature on all that without any hesitation* It is very surprising that such a claim should now be created by His Highness the Ruler •treaties Were .made between me end and of Bahrain about Zubarah after /conclusion of negotiations and the granting of concessions over all Qatar, Zubarah etcetera without exception. If the Bahrain people had the least claim or a slightest doubt, they would not have kept quiet all this time, i, therefore, decided that according to proofs put forward about which you are aware, that you would see that this their claim is useless and they have no least connection with what they claim nor there is any truth in their claim. I hope, that while administering Justice in the case, you will kindly consider a way for settling this matter and putting a stop to this dispute as the claim of the Bahrain people to ny limits is a mere step of encroachment and agression. I am certain that you do not agree that my rights should be affected and that you are inclined to follow the right way and give the rights to their ov/ners. I also beg to invite your attention to the friendly relations and treacles existing between me and the H;£gh 3pi Ish Government -which are known to you. I an the same friend who still adops oiia lines wnicn. meet with the satisfaction and approval of the British Government. Usual Bn ding,*■from Shaikh Abdallah To' Captain Hickinbotahm, -^.A. ^ated 5th H a bi al ^bani 1356 (14th June 1937). A. C. l be * to state to you wiih regard to the question of %shid bin %ha r anad and his followers, -on ai’e aware that they -are ny subjects and under me formerly and newly and they are from Q a tar tribes; there are clear proofs in this connection. 1 have explained clearly about this and waited all this time with a hope that their return may be obtained in a satisfactory way, that they should submit to me and return as they were, obey my orders and avoid useless thffes which do not concern them in a peaceful way for the sake of their safety and peace for all. But I do not see but my toleration would increase their arrogance and declaration of hostility against me. why they should show hostility to me and spoil my subjects when they are my subjects. N 0 w the case has reached to a stage where no toleration c uld be expected, l am better aware of ny subjects and of my country, if they submit to peace between me and them then I wish the safety and if they refuse to any ting to; but detest and corruption and continue making disturbances as they do now 1 shall be compelled to make them return to my submission and obedience by any means by the strength of God. ^t the people of B a hrain always send them helps in any away even arms which they collect from every where inside and outside and send to I\ T a im. And to any foreign subject they come across they give him money and send him secretly. 1 have heard that they sent certain subjects of ^ a hrain etc to M a im to instigat^y subjects to raise against ae fighi^ with me. I therefore make it clear to you that l would not be responsible for anything which may occur to the subjects of Bahrain who went and joined the -.aim in order to fight with my subjects in my country.And 1 request you to issue orders to Bahrain subjects who joined the IToim to disperse and return to Bahrain and leave the h a im alone as they have no connection with rny subjects. And when you receive this letter then the armistice concerning n a im s terminated and ± have ordered my representatives that when they receive this letter and cannot arrive at an agreement with H.H. the huler of -^.hrain to rry last proposals to return to me as soon as possible as the negotiation out has taken a long time with/any result.R ^ort made bv Abdullah bin Hasan* Head Farrash,. I left Bahrain by launch on the 20th cJune 1937 at 08.00 P.M. and arrived at Qatar on the 21st June 1337 at 1.30 P.M. The Shaikh was at Hayyan and on rny arrival at Dohah, Abdullah bin Jar wish arranged for a car to take me to -ftayan where 1 handed over the letter to Shaikh Abdullah. He read it and then showed it to his son ! Ali. * 'The* he called his second son ’Ai Hamad from Dohah and then all of them held a meeting between themselves. Later I left and went to my relative's house who is the Shakh's clerk. While at Ray an I saw 30 horses, a number of camels and a lot of people said to be 500 of Wakrah. They were the last detachment to go to Zubarah side. Later about 200 toen came some of whom were cavalry men. ^hey were under the flag of the sons of Ahmad bin Thani and were bound for Zubarah to join the previous detachments. As I heard from my relative, the total number of men sent to Zubarah side was 5370. I heard th&amp;t on the 20th June 1937 the bedouins of Qatar plundered 18 she-camels and 7 young male camels from the Nairn at Zuabarh while the latter were busy in making an Ardhalwar dance J. The bedduins brought the booty to Qatar and they were immediately branded with the Qatar ^wasm* (brand). On the 21st June 1937, in the afternoon, certain bedfcuins of Qatar brought 7 camels which they had plundered either from the Chaban or %im tribes. While at Rayan, 1 used to notice a lot of bedouins coming to shaikh Abdullah daily getting arms and ammunition(said to oe of the Turkish time) which are stored at the entrance of Shaikh's place. Entries used to be kept of any jj aims given by the Shaikh. Four days before ny arrival, all Qatar: divers were recalled from the banks and I saw the diving boats lying at anchor on 3atar harbour. Tow launches were loaded with provisions such as rice and dates which are said to be taken over to Fhwairit village. Prior to qy arrival it has been arranged that the Shaikh should proceed to Zabarah front by cars |©-® on the night of 21st June 1937 and for this purpose they had loaded arms, ammunition and water on a lorry but when I delivered the letter, this arrangement was cancelled and the Shaikh decided to go there next morning, i.e., 22nd d u ne 1937. *'irst 1 was promised that the reply would be given to me at 10.00.P.M. on 21-6-37 but later a slave came to me and told me that the letter would not be ready till next morning. Later however, Shaikh Hamad came to me and s aid that if 1 could go back the same night, he would seal the letter and give it to me. I replied in the affirmative and he gave me the reply. I -0- -Bahrain ao 6.00• P• Iv.. on the 21—6—37 and arrived here to-day at ^ ~ ' should take one route so that they may not he short of water. I heard Shaikh Hanad telling his father Shaikh Abdullah that 5atar, as I saw it, was in a disturbed state and every one was preparing for ’war. The town was almost empty Xhe people used to go towards Zubarah on fffot, 0 n camels and on horses es. Shaikh Abdallah has issued orders that each party the inhabitants of Simaisrnah, Dhaiyin and n h or an hahanda had already left for Zubarah in one party under the fla • of the brother of Shaikh Abdullah, ihe inhabitants of ITafiar, G^ariv -afi ar, G^ariy ah and Fuwairidh and Badhloof left i m one party 22/6/373 a hrain, dated 13th Rab i al iliani 1 356 22nd Jijne 12 37.

Bahrain Government informed me that today they suggested following amendments (a) Article 2 delete ’’according to terms of the agreement” (b) a minor addition to article 4 (c) Part 2 article 1. To be reconstructed to read as follows ”As long as the above conditions are carried out without alterations I agree to withdraw my claim to Zubarah and the Naim but should there happen anything contrary to the conditions my claim returns as before”. 4. The Qatar representatives refused to accept the suggestions on the grounds that they could not agree to less than a complete withdrawal of Bahrain’s claim to Zubarah and the Naim. They refused to consult Shaikh Abdullah or to carry a letter to him. 5. Later they interviewed me and confirmed above. Shaikh Nasir handed me a letter from the Shaikh of Qatar dated 15th June formally informing me that the negotiation were at an end and that he withdraw from his undertaking given to you. I told the representatives that they should remain in Bahrain pending instructions from you and that Shaikh Abdullah's withdrawal from his undertaking could not be acceptednot be accepted until you had considered the matter and communicated with him and that he would be responsible for any breach of the undertaking given to you until you had formally released him. 6. I suggest (a) I inform the Shaikh of Qatar in writing of the Bahrain Government’s latest offer and the attitude adopted by his representatives. (b) I inform the Shaikh of Qatar in reply to his letter (my paragraph 5) in the same terms as already communicated to his representatives. (c) Permit his representatives to leave with the above mentioned letters. 7. If the Shaikh of Qatar refuses to accept this generous offer of the Shaikh of Bahrain and will not accept the suggestion contained in my letter mentioned in paragraph 2 above then I am afraid nothing remains but to inform both the Shaikh of Qatar and the Haim that their undertakings have been annulled as from a fixed time on a date to be specified by you. 8. The Shaikh of Bahrain interviewed me on June 20th and June 21st he was very anxious and in the event of hostilities breaking out between Shaikh Abdullah and the Haim there may be a formal claim to Zubarah from the Shaikh of Bahrain with the request for our protection of the Haim as his subjects pending a decision on his claim.

I asked them whether the Bahrain Government had put forward any proposal as the Adviser had informed me by telephone that a fresh proposal had been put ferth. They stated that there was no proposal worth consider ing and that they were unable to accept any proposal which varied in the slightest from the words of the Shaikh of Qatar’s demand to the effect that the claim to Tubarah was withdrawn unconditionally. I suggested to them that their course should be to inform the Shaikh of Qatar of the Bahrain Government’s various proposals but they said that they were not prepared to do so and I then asked them whether they had re fused to carry a message in the form of a letter to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jassim and they stated that they had. I questioned them on this peculiar attitude of theirs but they merely replied that the negotiations were now at an end and that they were unable to carry messages of any sort to Shaikh Abdullah. I endeavour ed to persuade them that they should do so but was unsuccessful and Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh.handed me a letter dated the Xpth June from Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim to the effect that he considered the negotia tions as concluded and that he withdrew his under taking to the Honourable the Political Resident from the time the letter was handed to me* I immediately informed/*informed the representatives that I could not accept this statement of the Shaikh of Qatar and that the agree ment mast be considered to be in force until such time as I had received the Honourable the Political Resident's instructions in the matter and that the Shaikh of Qatar would be responsible for any breach of the undertaking which occurred until such time as he had received a formal release from the Honourable the Political Resident, I then informed them that they would not be able to leave Bahrain until I had received instructions from the Honour able the Political Resident after comnunicating the con tents of the letter which they had just handed to me.

Representatives of His Highness the Ruler oi Bahrain.fN The representatives of the Ruler of Qatar called this morning and enquired whether they had per mission to leave. I informed them that I had received instruction from the Honourable the Political Resident approving of ny action in detaining them till orders were received from him. Saleh bin Mana then handed me a letter from the Shaikh of Qatar to the address of the Honourable the Political Resident and further a letter to my own address. The letter to my address complained of the detention of articles in the Customs at Bahrain and I am requested teor the release of the articles. I informed them that I -«&amp;11 enquire into the incident of the Customs and that they should give n(r any details whenever they could do so. I told them that I would inform the Honourable the Political Resi dent of the Shaikh of Qataris request for their imme diate return^by telegram,and let them know as soon as I received a reply. I understand that Shaikh Nasir had written to the Shaikh of Qatar informing him that his representatives had been told not to leave Bahrain. Xu I informed the representatives that from the letters I have been receiving from Shaikh f Abdullah bin Oassim I have been led to believe that they were not informing him correctly of the events that took place in Bahrain, as the Shaikh in his letter stated that he did not under stand the reasons for the detention of his representa tives, and I had made it quite clear to them that they have been detained pending instructions from the Hon ourable the Political Resident. I further informed them that the Shaikh had complained of the rude^hess of the Bahrain Government in turning them out of the house/-house in which they had been living as the Bahrain Govern ment *s guests* I said that I understood that Saleh bin Mana had himself left the house which amounted in my opi nion to rudesness on his part. I enquired into the details regarding Shaikh Nasir»s leaving the house and he informed me that on a Friday he left the house and on his return he found the door closed. He had apparently made no enquiries for the reason and that he had merely heard rumours in the bazaar that the house had been intentionally closed as they were not guests any longer. I gathered that he had made no request for information through the representatives of the Bahrain Government. It is unfortunate that this mistaJke has occurred and I am speaking to the Adviser on the subject. I explained to the representatives of Qatar that they might rest assured that the Shaikh of Bahrain would not be inten- that there had been a misunderstanding and that His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain was very generous and that he would do no action which might amount to rudeness and that they con sidered that the mistake was probably due to the fact that there had been a mistmderstanding at the previous day’s inter view between themselves and the representatives of the Bah rain Government. I told them that they should immediately inform Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassim of what they considered to have taken place and should not leave him with the impression that the Bahrain Government and His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain had been intentionally rude to his representatives. tionally rude to them.

Yes, the lettei in question was received by me and although I learnt from it tnat you have alreauy wrote to the Naim ordering them to aisperse and not to interfere with any of my subjects, they ^re increasing in arrogance ana in shoving hostilities to me. They interfere with all my subjects and as an instance of this tuey sent some armed men of themselves who rtideu on the water well cplled M Al Thaghb' and occupied tne palace there. This water well is used by my subjects ana the people of Khuwair village. There are also date-palms belonging to my subjects Al Dusoom. They took away their fruit and cut do'vn some of them. They take away all camels and cattle of my subjects which the. come across. They slaughter ana eat some and retain the rest which they treat as a booty. There was no step of inteference, aggression ana corruption whicn they did not take. How can 1 bear this corruption of theirs whereas they are my subjects ana within my territory ? ^hen 1 saw that they were doing more mischief and corruption, 1 wrote to the Political Agent, Bahrain and informed him that 1 terminate the truce with Rashia bin Muhammad ai Jabur and his followers ana that nobody is to interfere in my subjects and in my territory. T^at I can deal with them and cannot leave them on tneir persistence in showing hostilities ana corruption to me. I had alreadytolerated raucn. Being anxious for tneir safety and for tne comfort of all, I tolerated for about 3 months hoping that they would submit to me in an amicable way, but this my toleration did not do anything but made them show more arrogance and hostility and spread a spirit of corruption amongst all my subjects. 1, therefore, terminated the truce with Rashid bin Muhammad and his followers, four Honour also stated that you have heard from the Political Agent, -oahrain, that the negotiations are still going on. It b&amp;J ^^ot be hidden from Your Honour that these negotiations took a long time anu the representatives of His Highness the Ruler of %hrain ?re insisting in their hostile claims against me, my town ana my boundary. My representatives are staying in Bahrain in the hope that His fi puiess the Ruler of Bahrain may agree to my proposals but it is regretted that they contempted my representatives, closed down the guest house which you ordered for them and turned them out of it in an indecent way. The wrote a letter to ny represetatives which indicates that they are terminatm the negotiations on their .side, a copy of which is enclosed for your perusal. Later my representatives remain ed for some days during which period they were subject to cruelty and contempt. No result has been achieved out of these lengthy negotiations. Your Honour also said that I must have received, long prior to tuis date, the proposals of His High ness the Ruler of Bahrain to the effect that one of his relatives may meet with two of my relatives in connection with these matters. Yes, on 20th June 193V equivalent to 11th Rabi Thani 13b6 I received a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain on this subject. It reached me one night before tuts your letter. Your Honour said that you presume tnat it reached me long before the receipt of this your letter, but there was no space of time between that letter ana your letter save that which I mentioned above. 1 sent him a reply saying that if His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, as he(Political Agentjsaid, wishes a meeting to be held between his brother Shaikh ’Abdulla3.

No. 568/Si) 1 . Bahrain, June 26, 193?. Dear Hickinbotham, I have enquired about the matter of the house occupied by the ^atar representatives. The arrange ments for their entertainment were in the hands of his Highness* steward, Abdullah bin Jabr. he informs me that the servants provided by us were left in the house after Nasr returned but on the i’riday in question they locked the front door and left the back door open. Nasr returned with money intending to tip the servants but found the door locked and went straight to his launch v/here he remained. Abdullah bin Jabr assumed that negotiations had ceased and that Nasr was no longer an official guest; the house was then locked up. No mention was made of the matter to the Bahrain representatives by Nasr, had he let them know they would of course have seen that the former arrangements were continued. It is most unfortunate that this misunderstanding should have ocurred. His ilighness of course knew nothing whatever about it and would I know be most distressed at any reflection on his hospitality.

Wounded man states he was travelling from Al Thaghb to Akhday four miles north of Fureiha on the Coast to fetch his family when he was ordered to surrender his arms by three unknown cavalry men of the Shaikh of Qatar. He refused and was shot in the shoulder. He is a Naimand was in my opinion outside the Zubarah area. 3. I have no doubt that the Shaikh of Qatar is harassing the Naim as much as possible and I consider his action in permitting his bedouins to interfere with the Naim at will amounts to a breach of his undertaking not to interfere with them. It would be very difficult to prove any individual case. PoliticalTelegram R 17 From Political Agent, To Political Resident, Bushire. No. 160 Dated 1st July 1957. IMPORTANT .

I request Imperial Airways and Rojial Air Force be warned not to fly low over Qatar. ill I f- Statement of Hameed bin Ibrahim. Bahrain subject, living at Ras Rumaan, Manamah, diver. I left Bahrain last month, dived for some days, I got some good pearls and took them to Dohah, I arrived there about 14 days ago. In the boat with me was Mansoor bin Mahrus (Bahrain subject of Manamah) Bin Darwish came to us as we landed on the shore with four armed men and asked where we came from. When he heard we came from Bahrain, he took us to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim at his Fort, we told him we had come from Bahrain, diving, and came to buy food. He said, 'you are not divers, you are spies of Bahrain Government' Shaikh Abdullah ordered us to go to prison, in the Fort, for ten days. He gave us no food but one man called Abdul Aziz, whom we do not know, took pity on us and gave us food. While we were there another man from Bahrain, Jasim bin Abbas, was brought and put into prison with us. He was imprisoned because he refused to give Shaikh Abdullah some rifles which he owned. His wife lived at Dohah. After the ten days the jailer let us go. We went to Bin Darwish and asked for our goods, our boxes and our cooking Qf pots and pearls which had been taken out/our boat. Abdullah bin Derwish said first we must get two men from Bahrain, from those living in Dohah, as witnesses to our statement that we had never been in prison, before he could give us our belongings. We pretended to agree to this. The owner of ^ joliboat then came W Bahrain and we told him about our case, he told us not to sign any papers but to inform our own government. We got away secretly i ,secretly in a Bahrain boat and went to Gariyah because we heard that some of our people were there. Our joliboat and our belongings were kept in Dohah and are still there. The boat belongs to Hassan bin Mahmood of Manamah, it is registered in Bahrain. We had the boat from him on the 'Gralata* system, we gave a proportion of the catch to the owner. Statement of Hassan bin Mahmood, Bahrain subject boat owner, resident of Manamah. I own joliboat No. 245/42 registered in Bahrain. I lent my joliboat to Hameed to go diving, ,f Mjenna ,f (shore diving). He went diving. He returned today and informs me that my boat has been seized by the government in ^attar.fit. frr'/l. Note of an interview with Mr. Belgrave on the 1st of July 1937. The party arrived on Saturday evening at Ghariyah and Mr. Belgrave who had been consistently sick immediately landed and slept on shore. The Bahrain representatives met the Qatar representatives on three occasions and al though the negotiations appeared at first likely to ter minate successfully, it became clear later that unfortuna tely the first impression had not been correct and that there was little or no hope of concluding a successful compromise. On one occasion the Shaikh of Qatar met Shaikh f Abdullah bin f Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad and Mr. Belgrave. It appears that the meeting was not altogether a cheerful one as the party sat for exactly an hour without making any remark and at the end of this period the Shaikh of Qatar left. Mr. Belgrave told me that Shaikh »Abdullah bin Qasim appeared to be distraught /fa- and^he said that he (Shaikh »Abdullah bin Qasim) was finding it very difficult to control his followers and had to post men to see that his followers remained in their camp at night. The Bahrain representatives were treated politely and with due formality. 2. Mr. Belgrave informed me that the state of Qatar was one of preparation for war. In fact, he went so far as to say that had been complete and that as far as he could see there were hostilities actually taking place. He stated that villages were being raided by Shaikh &gt; Abdullah bin Qasim 1 s tribes and that the houses and property of the Naim or their adherents were being looted. On his return journey by launch he observed parties/-parties oftroops performing military evolutions on the shore and coast and shots were being fired. He estimated that the main body of Shaikh iAbdullah bin Rasim’s forces was encamped some 15 miles southwest of Ghariyah and that in addition to a force which is estimated between 5 and 7 thousands men. Shaikh f Abdullah has three lorries adapted for carrying troops and six motor cars. It appears that during the entire visit, there were numbers of armed men coming and going and that all the people who in any way had anything to do with the Bahrain representatives were armed to the tweth^ e.ven the Doha merchants who came to see them on the last afternoon. I gather that the Bahrain representa tives had an unpleasant voyage as far as Qatar and that Shaikh Salman bin Hamad has not enjoyed his proximity to the warlike demonstrations that were being carried out 1»/his benefit. It is probable that a large per centage of the tribes etcetera which were parading, if one may use that term, before the Adviser and the Bah rain representatives were used to impress on them,with a view to their moderating their terms, the martial strength of the people of Qatar.

I therefore suggest that I am sent to Qatar with instructions to endeavour to bring about an understanding between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Faim.

Political Agent reports that ' ’ '^ n '’' between Bahrain and Qatar have finally broken down and that hostilities have broken out between Shaikh of Qatar and Naim tribe. 2. Political Agent and I have been at considerable pains to induce Bahrain and Qatar to negotiate, and keep these negotiations going on for nearly two months, and to arrange a truce meanwhile between Shaikh of Qatar and Naim which Shaikh of Qatar has now denounced as he states that Naim have not kept the peace. 3. In these circumstances there is no course now open to us except to let hositilities take their course, vide paragraph 3 of my telegram No. T/71 dated April 28th. 4. Oil Company (see paragraph 3 of my telegram No. T/86 May &gt;rd) will not resume operations until autumn and before that dispute between Shaikh of Qatar and Naim should have been settled. 5.

I r: 1 1 } | i • think/-think it unlikely these in any danger but Political Agent Bahrain should as soon as possible address letter to Shaikh of Qatar reminding him that he is responsible.for safety of British subjects and their property in his territory.

To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain.-• Sir, With reference to the Zubara dispute, I have the honour to acquaint you with the happenings at Gariyah. Three meetings took place, on the shore, between Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad and Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Jasim and Shaikh Ali bin Jasim, the son and brother of the Ruler of Q,atar. At the first meeting the Qatar shaikhs appeared reason able and anxious for a settlement, at the two later meet ings their attitude entirely changed. After the first meeting they asked us to send them a new draft some what shorter and more concise than the various draft agreements discussed in Bahrain. At the second meeting they said they would agree to no terms except their own and they added several fresh clauses to their own original draft agreement among them being one to the effect that the Ruler of Bahrain should hand over all the Arabs other than Naim who had joined the Naim at Zubara.— 3 - The Bahrain representatives finally agreed to the Q,atar proposals including the unconditional withdrawal of their claim provided that the agree ment was accompanied by an exchange of letters to the effect that if either side broke the terms of the agreement all the clauses in the agreement, including the withdrawal of claim, would automati cally become null and void. The Q,atar represen tatives definitelyrefused to agree to this proposal and sent a message, to this effect, by word of mouth of a clerk. After this final refusal a number of ^atar not ables, including Shaikh Ali bin Jasim and Mohomed bin Abdullatif al Ma«na came, unannounced, to call on Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman and begged them to accede to the Ruler of Qatar’s wishes. They were told that Bahrain could give way no further. On one occasion Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim visited the tent of the Bahrain representatives accompanied by about 200 armed Arabs, in three motor lorries, and four cars full of relations and notables. He drafk coffee with the Bahrain representatives but during the meeting, which lasted about an hour, scarcely any words were spoken on either side. Shaikh Abdullah, when departing, mentioned that he was at finding it difficult to restrain his Arabs from attacking the Naim. Actually attacks on several villages by cavalry and camelmen had already been made and during our stay at Gariyah several refugees came to the camp and reported that their houses had been burned and their belongings looted by mounted raiders from the Qatar forces.Xd At-* $9 I took no part in the actual conversa tions but was present in the tent during part of one of the meetings by invitation of both parties. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,No. C/508-4/13 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 3rd July 1937 From Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Hesiient in the Persian Gulf, Bushire U B A a A II Sir, I have the honour co report that on July the and His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain accompanied by Shaikh tAbdullah bin f lsa, Shaikli Salman bin Hamad, and the Ad viser to the Bahrain Government Mr. C.D. Belgrave, C.D.: ., called to interview me. His Highness vlio was suffering from a severe cold looked extremely worried. They stated that tiey were very much concerned about the events talcing place in ^ubarsh and that they were most anxious to know r;hat action His Majesty 1 s Government ■crere taking with regard to the pro tection of Bahrain subjects residing in atar Peninsula. Elis Highness pointed out that he understood that an under taking had been given by the Shaikh of Qatar not to inter fere with the Naim during the course of the negotiations and that similarly Shaikh Rashid bin MUhammad and the Naim had given an undertaking not to interfere or moaest the people of Qatar during the coarse of the negotiations, His Highness stated that from information which he had received from reliable sources the Shaikh of Qatc.r had attacked the Naim living in the 2ubarah area on the night of/-of July the 1st &lt;nd had. inflicted casualties on thea. That the Naim had been previously restrained from inter fering with Shailm f Abdullah bin '/asim f 3 forces by their leader Shaikh Hash id bin Miasmed, as he was atixious to keep his covenant with His Majesty 1 3 Governsient. In His Highness 1 opinion this attack on the Naim amounted to a breach of the agreement vhich he understood existed bet ween the Shaikh of Qatar and the Honourable the Political Resident, cold His Highness pointed out that by this action the Shaikh of Qatar had obtained a distinct and unfair advantage over the Naim* S* His Highness further expressed fee rs that the followers of the Shaikh of Qatar might endeavour to land and attack the isolated villages on the Bahrein Coast. I assured His Highness that in my opinion there was not the slightest likelihood of this event occurring. His High ness stated tnat in his opinion anyone who was mad enough to break an agreement with His Majesty’s Government was mad enough to do anything* I told His Highness that I did not for one moment believe that there was any possi bility of Shaikh ’Abdullah bin ■ asim authorising or per mitting his followers to come to Bahrain. Although I firmly believed that i&amp;iat I said was correct, at the s; me ■ / time I was doubtful whether my word was carrying as much weight as it should have done in view of the fact that I had previously informed His Highness that I diet not con sider that Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Oasim would renounce his undertaking with us to the extent of attacking the Naim* 4* M 1 1 . Beigrave informed me that he was generally in agreement with the views : is Ilghh:ss expressed, but that he was sure that no attack on Bahrain would be made but he thought it possible that the followers of the Shaikh-3- of Qatar might follow up boats bringing Haim fugitives to Bahrain, and he further stated that he was in agree ment ?jith the views which I had previously held to the effect that Shaikh * Abdullah bin Qasi» ?/ould not renounce his agreement and he was very Mzeh surprised at Shaikh *Abdullah bin Qasi» f s action* 5 * iVfter a considerable amount of general conversa tion regarding the present disturbance, I assured His Highness that X had reported the facts to yourseli cine that as soon as I had information, I would inform him what action, if any, was being taken* His Highness stated that he was proposing to come in again in the evening in oraer to find out from me personally whether there was any further event, and I informed him that if I had any communication of importance X would rather telephone to him or else myself come and interviev; him.

It is true Shaikh of Qatar has adopted an in- hi A transigent attitude (vide paragraph 5 of my telegram v D 612 of June 23rd) but his claim to Zubarah in my Opi nion is good (vide paragraph 14 of my Express letter X C/120 of May 5th).

I presume His Majesty*s Government and Government of India agree with my opinion as to ownership of Zubarah as I have had no indication to the contrary. I suggest therefore that I be autho rised to reply to Shaikh of Bahrain in following sense. 5. That on evidence before them His Majesty*s Government are of opinion that Zubarah belongs to Shaikh of Qatar, and in this connection they point out as long ago as 1875 the Ruler of Bahrain was informed ■by Government of India that he should not interfere 7 with the affairs of Zubarah vide letter May 31st 1875 from Resident to Ruler of Bahrain, Further that in this connection it should be noted that action taken in 1895 by His Majesty’s sloops in destroying hostile dhows at Zubarah was to prevent invasion of Bahrain from Zuba rah.

He asked if I had any objection to see Shaikh Rashid. I said I had not. I was under the impression that he was referring to his father-in-law Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad; however, when Shaikh Rashid appeared he was Shaikh Ra-^l^ bin Muhamnad al Jabur, the leader of the Naim* Shaikh Rashid proceeded to make a long complaint regarding the theft of cattle, etc., which he alleged Shaikh Abdullah had connived at both during and before the hositilities. I told him that if he had any complaint to make he should make it to the Ruler of Qatar. Shaikh Rashid informed me that he hdd entered into an agreement with the Ruler of Qatar and that he had agreed to obey the laws of Qatar while he resided in Qatar. Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Jassim had told him that he was at liberty to leave Qatar if he y/ished to. Shaikh Rashid then proceeded to make a fur ther complaint regarding the burning of houses and villa ges, etcetera. I again told him that these were matters for the Shaikh of Qatar and that His Majesty*s Govern ment did not interfere in the internal affairs of the Shaikhdoms and that if he had any complaints to make he should, strictly speaking, make them to the Ruler of the country. If he objected to observing the orders of the Ruler of Qatar, he appeared to be at perfect li berty to leave the country. Shaikh Rashid then stated that he had left the Zubarah area with his tribesmen and that he was living near Umm al Mai and that he was worried by the bedouins i^ho he stated were the subjects of/-of Ibn Samuel* I asked him if he had complained to the Ruler of Qatar and he said that he had not. I told him that in ny opinion if he had any complaint to make with regard to the people living in Qatar he should make the complaint to the Ruler of Qatar. I then took His Highness to one side and strongly advised him against meddling in any way in affairs on the Qatar Peninsula. I told him that there was nothing new in the present affair of Zubarah and that it had already been gone into many years before. I told him that I considered that Shaikh Rashid should return to his tribe and that if he had any complaint to make against his treatment in Qatar he should make it to the Ruler of Qatar. I explained to His High ness that he would be very annoyed himself if people living in Bahrain were to conplain to the Ruler of Qatar against other persons living in Bahrain, and that he ^as Shaikh of Bahrain would naturally expect people living in his country to make complaints to him and not to outsiders. His Highness then stated that he presumed that everything that had happened up to the time of the agreement between Shaikh Rashid and Shaikh f Abdullah bin Jassim would appear to be finished. I said that it appeared to me to be so. He enquired whether Shaikh Rashid should complain to the Ruler of Qatar regarding any incidents that had or might occur after the agreement he had made with Shaikh * Abdullah bin Jassim. I said that I had no doubt that he should complain to the Ruler of Qatar with regard to incidents which occurred. I also in - formed His Highness that the Ruler of Qatar apparently had/-had no objection to Shaikh Rashid leaving his country, and that if Shaikh Rashid did not wish to obey his orders then he was at liberty to leave the country, but if he decided to live there then he should obey Shaikh ! Abdullah*s orders. I told His Highness that; in order to complete rry records I would send ny Head Interpreter to Rashid this evening to take a note of what happened in Qatar during the ^ubarah episode from Shaikh Rashid^ point of view.Lcj /o . Statement made by Shaikh. Fashid. bin Muhammad, Chiei' of Naim tribe. Recorded in the Palace at Bahrain on the 13th July 1937. We had at Tkaghab in the Qasar 40 armea men. A messenger came from them saying that they were fearful and tnat they wanted camels and water be sent to them so that they should ride and come to us. We sent 26 men mounted on camels and four horsemen as guards in order to bring them When they reached near the ^asar Shaikh Abdullah T s army appeared. They were in cars and on horses (4 cars and about 30 horsemen) ana more than 2t&gt;0 camel riders. When our people saw Shaikh AoQullah T s followers, they returned and diu not go to the &lt; t asar. On their return the cars and the horsemen overtook them so they were obliged to make their camels kneel down. Shaiivh Abdullah T s men fired on them and killed four men among them was my brother Hamad bin Muhammad. They also killed 4 horses, wounded three men and killed 24 camels. Then they captured the Qasar and demolished it. They also occupied the towns (Faraihah, Arish, Akhdai, H asr al Thaghab and Khuwairjtook away all the foodstuff and plundered those who were from our followers, such as al Akbesah and Bu Ka f aban, carrying away their clothes, mattings, pots, cows, donkeys and the hair tents. They also took away the sails ana the ropes of the boats. Afterwards Shaikh Abdullan marched and halted near Morair fort which belongs to Zubarah. One of the Arabs (Haza f bin Khalil, Shaikh Hamaa r s man) wrote asking him (Shaikh Abdullah) to refrain from sneding the blood of the Muslims and also from demanding anything from them. He (Shaikh Abdullah) then sent a letter with his brother saying that he wanted to see me. I interviewed him because our food stuff had exhausted and the way was cut as Shaikh Abdullah stood between us and Bahrain. When I went to him2 in the camp Shaikh Abdullah told me that he would not give us security unless we have surrendered our arms. We surrendered our arms as we were forced by hunger to do so and because we did not do anything as ordered by the Political Agent. Then they themselves wrote a document and took my seal and sealed it. It ran as follows ’’That as long as I am residing in Qatar I should not do anything against Shaikh Abdullah and should not fight with him and if I want to leave Qatar and go to any other place he will not prevent me and my followers and all connected to me such as property etc. to do so”. The property taken away from us by Shaikh Abaullah:- What I handed over personally to Muhammad bin Abaul Latif bin Mani f 92 rifles. Taken from the people of Thaghab 40 rifles, from Muhammad al Nafaihi 10 rifles, from Bu Kawwarah 12 rifles, from Ka’aban 11 rifles, from Haza f bin Khalil 9 rifles. Also taken 40 camels, 120 sheep, 100 donkeys. 10 camels were taken away by Bedouins. Shaikh Abdullah seht horsemen to pursue the Bedouins and restore them, but they have not yet returned. These ten camels were taken away by Bedouins after the peace. !Telegram 4-— 4 Q From To India Office, London, Political Resident, Bushire Repeated to Government of India Political Agent, Bahrain No, 1903 2^3 Received 16th July 1937, Dated 15th July; Your telegram No. 715 of July 9th. ZUBARAH. His Majesty*s Government they are competent authority. They are anxious however not to give Shaikh of Bahrain the impression that they admit he has a orima facie claim (incidentally this would of Qatar from any action at Zubarah until claim has been adjudicated). They therefore feel that reply should be on the following lines. 2. His Majesty*s Government is ultimate authority for deciding questions regarding ownership between Shaikhs. They are of course always ready to listen to any representations which Shaikh of Bahrain may wish to submit on any matter which he regards as affecting his interests, but in the meantime they L feel compelled to point out that so long ago as r-* 1875 (see your telegram No. 680 of July 4th) Shaikh of Bahrain was informed he should dis-sever him self entirely from affairs of Qatar including Zubarah. They accordingly regret with reference to letter from Shaikh referred to in paragraph 2 of your telegram of July 4th that they are not prepared to intervene between Shaikh of Qatar and Naim tribe. 3. If Government of India agree and unless you see any objection, you should reply to Shaikh on ge neral lines.

Ruler of Qatar, to Captain T.Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Ban rain. i j U ^ After Compliments. Referring to what I wrote to you in my letter dated 26th Rabi al Thani 1356(5-7-37), I hastened to take action and put an end to the disturbances and restlessnesses created by the rioters of my subjects who disobeyed my orders. »Yhen I got near them and they felt my determination in taking measures against them, they repented their insubordination and yielded to me, listeners, obedient, contemptible, submissive to my orders and praying for pardon and mercy for the crimes and wrongs which they committed towards me and the country and admitting their guilt. I could not do anything, in these circumstances, but to pardon and forgive them for their faulty deeds for which they deserved punishment. But I preferred forgiveness rather than punishment when they yielded to me contemptible, confessing the wrongs and lapses. I did all necessary in such cases, scattering their concentration ana making each of them return to his own place after I took the necessary precautions to stopping them from insubordination again. The tranquility and peace have been restored, thank be to God for his favours, to all parts of the country. But, Your Honour, I regret to mention the acts committed by Bahrain during this time, by reinforcing the rebels of my subjects by supplying them with provisions, money,arms and ammunition with the object of spreading the spirit of revolution and in subordination amongst my subjects which is not admitted by laws and rules. I have found amongst the arms possessed by the rebels of my subjects, arms which bore the Bahrain Government mark. And my subjects alleged that they nave been2 . sent to them by the Bahrain Government. This is a proof to what 1 referred to before. Your Honour, I am sorry for the actions taken by the Bahrain Government as I do not imow on what grounds the Bahrain Government did so. As I wrote to you before, tne Bahrain Government prohibited goods and boats from going to Qatar and did what may be expressed as estrangement in addition to the continuous supplies sent to my subjects. I conmunicated to you my protest against this. The estrangement is still going on though I do not see that there is anything which may call for it. 1 have written to the Honourable the Political Besident about this matter communicating to him my protest because I want to know the reason for this attitude of the Bahrain Government towards me and the estrangement carried out in spite of the friendship existing between me and them. It is obvious that it is not permissible that the situation should continue in this obscurity and vagueness and there should remain no mistake in this matter because prohibition is a tact and there is no ambiguity and difficulty about it. And I do not know whether the Bahrain Government will continue this estrangement so that I may be aware for my own work. I should be grateful and thankful to you if you would kindly let me have a clear and early reply about this. Usual Ending.Telegr am From To Repeated Q. Government of India, Simla.

You mentioned that His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain is withdrawing lihe privilege of tranship ment dues which was previously extended to my State and that a fee of 5 per cent will be recovered instead of tran- 2 per cent the usual and general/shipment dues. That further, he is prohibiting Qatar subjects from entering # Bahrain. That is a matter which causes regret. I beg to enquire from you about the reasons on which the Bahrain Government based this ban. Do you see anything which justifies such a step and allows it. I shall be very grateful and thankful to you if you will kindly have this made clear to me so that I may be well aware of it. Regarding the question of messengers which you mentioned.it is admitted that I will end messengers and letters on evay occasion required. I also like to agree with you by giving you timely notice about their arrival but by what means should I communicate with you as long as subjects of Qatar are prohibited from, entering Bahrain.

I suggest that I address a letter to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain informing him of the alle gation of the Shaikh of Qatar and asking him if he can explain how this could have occurred. I feel that the answer that will be given by the Bahrein Government will probably be to the effect that the Shaikh of Qatar has been making var on the tribesmen of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain and that the arms that they had in their stamp as they v/ere given to them as Bahrain subjects well before tnere were hostilities between the Naim and the Ruler of Qatar. possession would naturally bear the Bahrain Government- 2 - 4* With regard to the second letters from the Ruler of Qatar dated the 17th July. X do not see v ' ^ :ltrrn 0 ’ JLr asking the Bahrain Crovoi’ninent for their reasons for the re-imposition of the 5&lt; duty and the prohibition against the landing of Qatar subjects in Bahrain, but I tliink it would be reasonable to inform the Ruler ol Qatar that presumable the Bahrain Govern ment nave taken these measures as they consider that the treatment of Bahrain subjects in Qatar is not all that could be desired. We may point out to the Ruler of Qcuar that the measures are of a temporary nature only ana that presumably the Bahrain Government would be disposed to withdraw them should they consider that the treatment of Bahrain subjects in Qatar no longer jus tifies such measures. o. I am informed by the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment that very few of the Naim have actually crossed over to Bcilirain but that a number of people from the smaller tribes such as the Bu Khwara have arrived and are appa rently living either on property previously owned by them or mith friends and relatives in Muh&amp;rraq and other parts of the Island.
