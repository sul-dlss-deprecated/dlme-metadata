British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, £ Ax&gt;rll 1914. To The Political Agent, Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to forward copy of letter N0.222-EA dated April 3rd from the Government of India, with enclosures, regarding a complaint of Messrs A.T.Shashoua &amp; Go., of Manches- -ter against the Customs House at Kuwait in connection with their claim against Jasim Muhammad Budi for about f 3990 (with interest). 2. I should be glad if, after enquiries from the Shipping Agents, you would interview Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Sabah on the subject, and obtain orders from him for the prompt payment of his debt by Jasim Muhammad Budi. 3. In regard to the general principle involved in the correspondence herewith forwarded, you are no doubt well aware of the wide prevalence of the ,T inconvenient practice”, alluded to in Foreign Department letter N0.222-E.A., dated 3rd April 1914 to my address, at all the steamer visited ports of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. From the noint of view of trade, the ideal would be attained if the local authorities at each port could be induced to lay down, and abide by, the following rule vis: 'The Customs House authorities are for- -bidden in future to grant delivery of any goods for which the agents of a Shipping Company have not handed them a delivery order'. 4. The records of your agency show that Shaikh Mubarak himself holds views strongly opposed to the attainment of thisZ3 24 cS ideal and I unders'taiid that the principle underlying hie. opposi- -tion would be that he considers that the rule would give too much power to the local shipping agents and would reduce himself and his Customs Department in trade matters to an inconveniently subordinate position vis-a-vis a mere trader. The view is natural enough in one who exercises despotic authority but the equally natural opposition of important British commercial interests, disclosed in the accompanying ^apers, shows that it is doubtful if the present anomalous practice can be allowed to continue if the port of huwait is to progress in the future as it has so satisfactorily done in the past. I have therefore the honour to request that you will consider and report /hether, in your opinion, there is any uros- -Pect of successfully inducing Shaihh Sir hubarak to accept this important alteration in the procedure of his Customs Administra tion but you should not at present approach him on the subject, unless you feel confident that you can do so with fair nrospects of success and without danger of causing friction between your- -self and the Shaikh, which, especially at the present juncture, would be greatly to be regretted. The report now called for will form the basis of any proposals, in regard to Kuwait, that I may make in reply to the Foreign Department letter already quoted. I have the honour to be.

The irregular arrangement, which Messrs.

The South Persian Trading Company, 3, Brazil Street, Manchester. 31st January, 1914. Dear Sir, Confirming our Mr. Shashoua’s conversation with you respecting the diffi culties we are meeting with in our trading relations with a client at Kuwait (Persian Gulf) we beg to place before you as suggested fuller details of our complaint. From February 1912 until recent date we have been shipping ordered goods to our client Mr. Jassim Mohamed Boodey of Kuwait. Our shipments to him during this period total to about £15,630. Against these shipments we have drawn upon him by Bills payable upon demand, and of these ill,600 have been paid, but a number of Bills totalling to about Z3,990 still remain unpaid although some of them are now over 12 months old. We have written him repeatedly, and have wired him times out of number to pay these Bills,, but without result, and there has been no valid excuse put forward for non-payment. There is one feature about this business to which we would draw your special attention as it is one of much importance to traders here and probably has some bearing upon the difficulty of obtaining remittances and is the root of all the trouble. As a result of constant enquiries which we have -caused to be made we have every reason to believe that although the Bills of Lading for the unpaid shipments are still in the hands of the Bank, the goods relative thereto have been released by the Customs Authorities at Kuwait by an arrangement between them selves and our client, but which is entirely without our authority.. Mr. Boodey is a relative of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the probability is that the Customs Authorities there are in friendly relations with both the Shaikh and our client, and, as a consequence, have extended to him privileges which are cer tainly irregular. The plain fact remains that although our Bills are unpaid our goods are in the hands of our client and probably sold. The arrangement under which the release of goods is effected is by a Bond given by Boodey to the Customs. This Bond we assume will only be fulfilled when it suits his convenience or in the event of3 the documents being presented by other than himself. As a matter of fact we can only assume what this Bond really is, for we are unaware of its conditions and have only learned of its existence through the Steamers Agents. As w r e have no Agent in the Persian Gulf to act for us, and as the Banks who hold the docu ments have no means of forcing payment, we place these facts before you to see if you can help us in the matter. We may add that on December 5th, we put the position of affairs before the Secretary of the Manchester Guardian Society for the Protection of Trade and caused him to send a letter to Boodey reviewing the situation and demanding payment, but their letter has been ignored. We understand that of comparatively recent date Kuwait has become a British Protectorate. If this is so, we presume the Crown will be represented by some person of authority, or in any event will have means of enforcing its authority, and would be in a position to take up the matter with the Customs authorities or with the Shaikh, at Kuwait. We, therefore, respectfully ask your assistance in placing the matter before the Foreign Office to ascertain if they can assist us in obtaining satisfaction. We feel confident that if the Foreign Office can get in touch with the Kuwait authorities and point out to them the irregularity of the action of the Customs officials a speedy settlement would be effected. Should it also be found after further enquiry that only part of the goods have been released in the manner stated, we desire that pressure be put upon Mr. Boodey to enforce an immediate clearance of all shipments made to him. We enclose you a list of the shipments relative to this letter and we shall be pleased to place at your disposal any further information you may desire. We remain, etc., (Signed) A. T.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your confidential letter No. 222 E.-A., dated 3rd April 1914, regarding alleged irregularities at Kuwait Customs House. 2. With reference to the particular claim of Messrs. A. T. Shashoua and Company of Manchester against Jassim Boodey, the Political Agent, Kuwait, has reported that the case has been settled by Messrs. Shashoua’s agent in con sultation with the parties who have expressed to the Political Agent their com plete satisfaction at the result. The arrangement was come to through the good offices of the Shaikh of Kuwait at the instance of the Political Agent, and a copy of the agreement has been filed in the latter’s office. 3. With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, the Political Agent reports that the practice of allowing the Customs authorities, whether on a bond or by some other arrangement, to release goods prior to the production of a delivery order supplied by the Agents of a Shipping Company, ceased some four months ago on a change in the Customs management, wffien strict orders were issued by the Shaikh forbidding the irregularity. 4. The Political Agent, Bahrain, in reporting on the same question, states that the irregular practice complained of does not prevail at Bahrain. 5. On the Persian Coast, where the Belgian Customs officials have charge, there have been no complaints on that score. 6. There remain the more difficult ports of Maskat and Dibai and perhaps in view of recent developments, similar difficulties may be expected to recur on the A1 Ahsa coast. As regards Maskat, I await the Political Agent’s report, and I fear, judging from my Maskat experience, that he has no easy task before him. 7. I have so far called for no report from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, in regard to Dibai, as I wish to examine the question myself and submit proposals. I doubt the possibility of the Residency Agent intervening with any hope of success, and I fear that with the present difficulties of touring it may be some time before I shall be able to take up the question. As regards the A1 Ahsa coast, nothing is as yet practicable except to watch developments.No.D/10425 € Cuetorn House, Dated Basrah 2$th March 1917.

I explained to the Shaikh that Koweit was the only place at which this custom of levying duty on goods not landed prevailed, and pointed out to him that owner-nakhudas, bringing cargo up the Gulf for sale wherever the market was good, who knew of this custom,would certainly manifest their cargoes elsewhere^and that / his port might thereby lose trade; I added that such men had no means of knowing that.such a custom prevailed at Koweit, as it was quite unknown elsewhere. He replied to the effect that Koweit trade was doing very well and that this custom was in force during the time of his father and brother and that what was good enough for them was good enough for him. We had a lengthy discussion on ~he subject but he was very obstinate about the matter, making great play with the point that the cargo brought by the 4 Kachi boats about which the question was raised,was imported to the order of a well-known Koweit merchant who was well aware of the custom, and that the nakhudas must have known all about it. His real objection seems to lie in the fact that the eventual desti nation of a large proportion of goods imported to Koweit is Mashur Hindian etc (being smuggled presumably into those places^ and he fears that if he adopts ^practice prevailing at other ports, the nakhudas of dhows will simply land that portion of cargo for i 1 HRfor which there ie a good market at .oweit and tfcke the rest to -3hur otc, ail that he w ill lose his duty on a lot of carrrojif he calls for proof of payment of duty in some other, country, he will defeat nis own object and drive the hakhudaa to manifest elsewhere. I presume that the nakhudaa of the dhows obtain manifests to Koweit and not to Vaahur etc because if they took out manifests to latter places they would have to pay the Persian ( ustoma duty, either because the Persian Customs Department or the british representative would hear of their coming from the Indian Customs Department, or because the latter demands proof of cargo having been landed and paid Customs duty when the dhow returns to India. The most I could get the Shaikh to do was to say he'would think over ♦he matter', which, if he remembers the shaikh of Bahrain in this respect, means that he’will forget about it as quickly as possible. The Head Clerk informed me that the Shaikh has been coached up in this subject ^ind advised to adopt a nfcn pbssumus attitude by the Director of Customs Khan sahib Abdul Latif, who, according % to ,? r. D'Mello has lately been getting too big for hie boots and giving a considerable amount of trouble. He also informed me that since the correspondence forwarded with ycur memo, under reply was written, Capt. McCollum had written another letter to you suggesting that the Shaikh’s assent to abolish this custom should be one of the conditions on which the Bunder Shweikhd lease should be resumed,after cancellation. If the lease Is cancelled and resumed this would be a good way of settling the matter if Col. LeachmAn cannot settle it by constantly pressing the Shaikh. I think it possible that he may be able to do so, and if you agree I will send a letter requesting him to do so. There seems to be no reason wny Koweit saould enforce a rule which does not obtain any where else. Sd/- o.P.Trevor, Lieut-Col. Deputy political Hesidont,•Persian iulfNo. I05Z of 1920. Britisfa.

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 25th May 1921* To The Political Agent, Kuwait* Memorandum* Please refer to correspondence ending with your memo No* 68-C dated the 20th April 1921* The following information has been given me by Monsieur Delcorde, Provincial Director of Customs, Eushire* At the end of last March one of the Persian Company’s steamers landed at Kuwait some 7,000 cases of tea. As this quantity of tea was sufficient to have kept Kuwait provided for a number of years it seems clear that the tea was not intended for local consumption but in all probability intend ed, as Monsieur Delcorde suggests, to be smuggled from Kuwait to Behbehan via the small ports between Pao and Dilum* Again on the 17th of this month the same Company’s steamer the 'Kuwait' arrived at Bushire* It appears that she sailed straight from Bahrain to Kuwait without touching at Bushire as is usually done* From Kuwait she returned 9 to Bushire and from Eushire she left for Basrah* Monsieur Delcorde’s explanation of this somewhat strange proceeding is that the'Kuwait’s' object in not touching at Bushire on the journey between Bahrain and Bushire was to avoid having to show her manifests for Kuwait and that she too like the previous steamer was carrying large consignment for Kuwait obviously in excess of local regimenonto and therefore in tended for smuggling. The Dxplanation seems a probable one* In fact as a result of inquiries made during his recent visit to Dilum Monsieur Delcorde has ascertained that a very considerable amount of smuggling is going on in and there around Dilum and/is reason to believe that Kerbelai Ali Kazerooni of Kuwait is in alliance with Hussain KhanMU V Gr hi Khan Kalantar of Dilum one of the most active offenders &lt;@ (I am making inquiries about Hussain Khan and I shall be glad if you will do tho same regarding Kerbalai All Kazerooni)• As Monsieur Delcorde is co-operating with us in the prevention of arms smuggling it would I think be good thing to give him such assistance as we can* Will you therefore approach the Shaikh on the subject of sending duplicate manifests through his Mudir of Customs direct to the Provincial Director of Customs Bushire and let me know whether the Shaikh is willing to agree to this* Lieut-Col*, PoliU cal Resident in the Persian Gulf.CONFIDENTIAL. No. of 1921. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, To The Political Agent, Kuwait. Memorandum : *‘ * 1 *- Reference your confidential memorandum No. 92fC dated the, 14th June. You say that the Shaikh considers that as all sailing boats-bound for Persian ports are in possessiori of proper manifests this should^be sufficient as the Provincial Director of Customs, Bushire, can obtain these from his own Customs officials 'who presumably are people whom he can trust'. I have put this view of the case to the Provincial Director of Customs and the point is that he cannot trust his own people. To give an example. A dhow leaves Kuv/ait with a cargo correctly manifested, for, say. Bandar Rig. She does / not put into Bandar Rig and never had any intention of doing so but goes instead to Dilum where with the ccnnivaoce of the Customs Mudir the manifest is either destroyed or given back to the Nakhoda and the dhow escapes Customs duties. It is in order to prevent this smuggling with the ccitriivance of his underlings that the Provincial Director of Customs asks for duplicates direct from the Shaikh* s Director in order that he may be able to check whether cargoes manifested to a particular place have actually been landed there. I should therefore be glad if you will again approach the Shaikh on the matter with a view to getting him accede to the Provincial Director of Customs request. Perhaps if the Shaikh does not like the idea of his Customs C ^Hector &lt;P- iV3 / 1 / 7 /v■■■■ ■i Collector having direct dealings with the Provincial Director of Customs here, II.E.would agree tc ' let you have copies of manifests which could be transmitted to the Director of Customs through the Residency. 1 would prefer this latter course myself as it is unde^sirable to have Belgian official or tne Persian Uustoras Department aetting into relations with the Arab Principalities. ^ (J Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. , 1 V ■i cr^riD^iTijLL.

Ke asks me to convey the above to you and explain his objection to complying with the request. Another objection which he hinted to me verbally, but does not mention in his letter, was that such a lot of trane-ehipping is done by sailing craft after leaving here that he feared that it would frequently be found that the cargo aid not i.ally with the manifest, and that we would blame hie Customs for issuing false manifests. I learn that the question was discussed by the Shaikh with his Council, and that the latter strongly advised him not to r Icomply with the request* As, however, his council are nerchants, and probably interested in the Persian trade, this is perhaps hardly to be wondered at.

Col. Knox has also noted in the co-arse of correspond ence on this subject that reference is sometimes made, per haps necessarily , to telegrams which have not been repeated to this office. For instance, in Bahrain telegram No. 47 -C dated 10th april, reference was made to your telegram No. 56 - 3 , which, as far as can be ascertained , has not been received in this office. In order to get a true perspective of the situation which has arisen between Bin Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait on the question of Kuwait Customs, Col.

It may perhaps help you to know that in the matter of having a Nejd official, customs or otherwise, at Kuwait, I fully share , so lar as advised at present, the apprehensions of the Shaikh and leading merchants at Kuwait. Bin Baud's local agent at Bahrain has heen giving us a very great deal of trouble; he t no doubt began by being a local commercial agent but is now arrogating to himself the position of a Consul, wants to sign passports and interfere in administrative matters . Altogether apart irom the question how far ^ is con venient or otherwise to have an aggressive Nejdi establishing an 'imperium in imperio* in these rather tottering principalities , Bin Saud's claim to be officially represented in places like Bahrain and Kuwait completely knocks the bottom out oi our det- erminaficn not to tolerate foreign interference of any kind other than our own. Until you receive other instructions or I see reason to modify my views , when 1 will at once let you Know, please bear this principle in mind as a cardinal point in our policy. Whenever you see a convenient opportunity in the course of con-* versation or otherwise with Nejdis oi position and influence , you mightMight take the opportunity oi rubbing it in that we cannot allow Bin Saud , by establishing agents,to open the door to other foreign agents who will presumably suit Bin Baud's policy as little as they do ours .

The suggestion that Ifcn Sa’ud should keep a Customs olerk here in Kuwait to work under the orders of the local Director of Customs and do that portion of the work which affected his interests was really Sir Percy Cox’s. I pointed out to him at the time that I thought Kuwait would probably object to this, but he said he did not see why they should, and that he thought it was necessary to ensure that Ibn Sa’ud got his proper share of the Customs dues on goods going to Kajd, as might be agreed upon. In the course of a conversation which I had with Ibn Sa*ud alone I sounded him as to how much importance he himself laid on this, and at the time he certainly did not appear to lay very much. -t'rior to the Uqair Conference^liad aaked Shaikh Ahmad to allow him to collect his own dues on goods going into Najd or to collect them for hin as he might prefer, as it was impossible for him to do so conveniently after they had left Kuwait, but had made no suggestion regarding Shaikh Ahmad’s dues. The prohibition of all trade with Kuwait by Najd subjects was the direct result of Shaikh Ahmad’s refusal. When Sir Percy visited Kuwait on his way back from 'Uqair he propounded his scheme for a Customs Agreement between Najd and Kuwait, including the proposal that Ibn Sa’ud should maintain a clerk here, to Shaikh Ahmad, and said that if he agreed in princih* would arrange with Ibn Sa’ud to send a CuBtomB expert to fix up details of an Agreement. Shaikh Ahmad ' who 1b a perfectly charming man to talk to, but lamentably weak ' merely replied in platitudes that it would be delightful to be able to come to an agreement and have trade with Najd reopened, but said not a word about hie objections, if he had any at the time. He came round to me a couple of days later, however, and r^i^ed hitf ob jections, ae X told Sir Percy in my telegram No. ft* 16$ d tea the lAth December A922. Saiyld Hamsah al-Ghauth has all along tiiken the line that tun&gt; there are only *» ways In which a Cuatome Agreement la poaaible either that Ibn Sa'ud keep &amp;n official here to look, after hie interests, or that a fixed annual payment be i-gredd upon ~ and the result of his checking the Shaikh’s schedule if correct (of which I am not yet able to form an opinion) seems to indicate rather that he 1b correct! I think Saiyld Hamzah al-Ghauth (who a native of Madinah and until quite recently an enemy of Ibn Da ub a) has been some wh&amp;t t^ictless in some respects. When he first arrived here v at any rate to me, he talked about Shaikh Ahmad having begged Ibn S&amp;ud to send an envoy - which, besides being untrue, seemed to serve no useful purpose ** and also said a lot about Ibn bau’uds “rights”? which would naturally annoy Kuwait people. ON the other hand he has helped Shaikh Ahmad very considerably with Ibn Sa’ik^s tribesmen - large numbers of bedouin had collected in the desert outside hoping to be allowed to come into Kuwait, and some were getting rather peevish at the delay. Shaikh Ahmad has certainly been far from tactful duringi'mM O * - these negotiations. As I suid in ay telegram No. 66-S dated the 30th April, he apparently started the ball rolling by asking Saiyld tiamaah if he thought I bn S.'ud would be angry if he refused to agree to tny Customs Agreement. The accom modation which he allotted to Saiyid Hamaah when he first came here was unquestionably not in keeping with hie position as representative of a ruler like Ibn ^a’ud, but he rectified thie later on. After I had persuaded Shaikh Ahmad to make some at tempt to ascertain the volume of Najd trade by reference to his Customs registers, he apparently wrote to Ibn Sa*^ to the effect that he had come to the conclusion that there was no hope of coming to an agreement on the terms that his envoy * suggested, and that he had decided to let him return to him, and to send with him a deputation of his own, including Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim of the Subah family, but that he was delaying doing so at present as the High Commissioner was urging him to check his Customs books first. Ibn Sa'ui ie~ said to have replied to this that that it was at the High Commissioner's advice that he sent his representative here at all but that he sees now that he was foolish to have done so and that as Shaikh Ahmad haa taken the line he has, he (Ibn ba'ud^ will not agree to a resumption of trade on apy terms whatsoever. If 'Abdullah aa-Salim is coming to him simply on a friendly visit, he will welcome him.; but if he wants to discuss this question, he had better atop awuy. I have not seen either of these letters myself, but I think there is no r ..' '1 doubt that the above is the slat of them. Well, 'Abdullah ae-Salim Ifi. going, and he and Salyid Hamaah al-C^hauth leave here on the 16th or 10th. He ie apparently tak- ing an enormous amount of preeente X to Ibn Sa'ud in the way of horses, money, eto., and a big consignment of rice ia said to be being sent to him via Bahrain * it all seems such a waste of money. Shaikh Ahmad's choice of 'Abdullah aa-Balim as his repre sentative absolutely baffles my understanding. He probably is the brainiest of the Sufcah, but he is a heavily built m -n and I would not trust hia* as tia* as I could throw him, and it is quite generally recognised that he is Shaikh Ahmad's bitterest enemy - 1 know Ibn Sa'ud thinks this as he told me so, and I certainly do. I think all chances of a Customs and Trade Agreement are over now, at apy rate for the present. According to S&amp;iyia ham- *ah c,l-uhauth is not really particularly keen on it himself, he would like to see trade with Kuwait re-opened, but chiefly so as not to be called a tyrant for prohibiting it - otherwise he aoes not much mind. It is true th .t the stoppage of trade with Kuwait hits 4asia very hard indeed, but that only affects the Interests of his subjects - not hie own ~ and he does not worry very much about them, here in Kuwait, although practically everyone aoee want to see a resumption of the Hajd trade, the fear of Ibn Baud is too great for them to agree volunt* c irtly to a Najd Customs man being kept in Kuwait, un the other hand, if S&amp;iyid a&amp;mzah'a cri ticism of the Shaikh's Customs return is tme, which i shall not be able to say for another day or two, Ibn Sa'ud could hardly be3. exp«oted to a-g**** to ary arrangOEiont without on# now. The Shaikh la very interested to know th# result of my chocking of th# register for him. It la &amp; long job as X aa not allowing It out of my own Bight at all, eo as to b# but# it la a 'clean' job. I do not suppose, however, he will do anything even If Salyid Hamzah'a figures do prove to be right, bp td‘ the pfrefceht-'Tn vibw of the high C«jaalBBloner , a views, 1 have naturally been re tner booming the idea of Itn ba*ud keeping a Uusto^a clelrk here; and, although I never did varj' nuch llko tiie Idea myself, yet I uo not nk It 1 b quite as objectionable as you think, for the reason that IIjo ^ a uo already has *■* and always has had since I nave been here - a commercial agent In Kuwait, vlx 1 Abdullah an-fiafisi, and Ms attitude is certainly always most correct. I raised thie point to Shaikh Ahmad some weeks ago, and pointed out that the proposed Customs clerk would presumably m a subordinate position compared with him. He replied that that was true, am it was also true Abdullah an-Nafisi had never given any klzvl of trouble, but that he thought this was due to Abdullah an- ^aflei ’s extraordinary tact and charm of manner, and that anyone but him would have acme. Ihe only chance of any Agreement that would be acceptable to both which I can think of would be for us to lend a properlj twined Customs clerk for two or three years - as I believe we have done in other places - to be in charge of the land Custom! and then, when the volume of trade was accurately known, for^o. d^ted t iie 7th J ul y .

It seems that he came to a private understanding with It® Sa'ud, by which the latter was to recognise him as his agent in « &lt;r Kuwait, with whom alone he would correspond, and was to allow tr-cle between Kuwait Wajd to be reopened, in return for the of the customs dues on goods exported from Kuwait by land, other than those destined for the Shaikh of Kuwait’s own subject, or for 'Iraq, which Shaikh 'Abdullah was to collect and remit to i hfcm. ^h^i^h Abdullah aa-Sailm had a long private interview with “halkh Ahnad on the a»th June, in which he le believed to have ureed him to settle the matter himself without taking the advice of hie people &gt; m, he said.

He saw no harm In his giving Xbn Sa’ud s fixed auiu if ne likstt - and friendship with him was certainly most deeir* sble, but It would be better for him to arrange things through Government. Hamad al-Khalld advocated fixing a standard 4 per oent export duty and remitting it all to Ibn Sa‘ud through Shaikh ’Abdullah, who alone would correspond with him. He said he thought they should try this for a year first, and reserve the right of discontinuing it if it did not prove satisfactory.Ham^d aa-Siwiar »uid that th#y could not i*&amp;r— to h^nd over the Gu»too» to Itn Sa'«d f but that the Shalfch ought to e^tlsfy Ibn Sa’ud by giving him money • not Cue tome auo^ ~ i- t0 come to an arrangement with him for trade to be reopened..

Shaikh Atoad broke up the meeting, asking them to think the matter over again for a couple of daye # itaen he would send for M them again. fhe above mentioned people were again summoned for fHS the morning of the itith July, as also was Shaikh Abdullah ae-^alim, and Shaikh Ahmad again asked them their views. Hamad al-Khalid said he still advocated their following the, terms of the document which they had presented to the Shaikh, end Shaikh Yusuf warmly seconded thie. Shaikh Jabir as-S u bah repeated that he would never agree to Ibn Sii'ud being given any share In the Kuwait Cub tome, but that he should be satisfied in come other way. Shamlan said he thought the stoppage of trade was the beet thing for them on the whole, as the Xkhwan were nasty people to have near one, and Shaikh Ahmad could not keep th^m in order. darned as-^aqar said that they could not give Ibn Sa'ud the Kuwait Customs, but that he thought they might satisfy him in some other way, and induce him to allow trade to be reopened. Ham ed al~ Ahalid thereupon accused him of having selfish motives for taking this line. He, of course, meant (as may well be true) that Hamad &amp;e~Saq&amp;r, being in such close business relations as he Is with Abdul ^atlf, the Director of Customs, does not want the Cuutoms to be under any better supervision than at present, ^ome very plain speaking was then Indulged in all round, and Shaikh Jablr accused ^h&amp;lkh Yusuf of having manoeuvred the whole thing and Induced people to sign the document without knowing what they w« eigtiing. Sheikh AhBAd then turned to Haaad Rl-Kh&amp;lld, and asked hlra itoat he recommended h«, should wrfte to tb-n Sa'ud if he Afreet ITTnhftt suggested, Ham&amp;d inipXltd that h* thought this wss &amp; mattw ^iSoh they al^t eeil leave to Shaikh •Abdullah, the 8fc*lWi /rot furious and said •'Abdullah Is not of tbs Sa’Qd fsally t nor le he In their estploy, he Is one of the Subah* you cannot answer anything Shaikh ^ablr than saidx'Well, Shallda husid, you are the Ruler and you know now *iat everyone thinks, r«od you had better do what p you think best', and he and Haaad ae-Saqar left the rooct« A few On the evening of the ACth July Ha^ad as-Saqar invited Shaikh Ahmad, Jablr aa-Subah and Shaalan to dinner on his launch.

Yhe Shaikh put 3t In his pocket without comment, and without even reading it. Shaikh 'AbdulIrvh riO-Salia c&amp;tne Into Kuwait froqr: Sha'b on the llthi, having written to Shaikh Ahriad the evening before asking for an interview. There la a rumour now that Shaikh Ahmad has agreed to this emanated from some retainer of Shaikh 'Abdullah's and Is exag Sa’ud to put forwt*rd certain counter proposals, and to ask certain questions, and - chiefly - to put off having to come to a decision, and I think this is much mors probable. Shaikh to have taken the advice you gave him recently and suggest to Itn Sa’ud that we should be asked to lend a trained Customs } official for a few years, until the value of the land customs known and a fixed annual payment could be agreed upon, but he seens must realise th^t if he agrees to this proposal, h# win very soon be Ruler of Kuwait only in name - if that'-, as Shaikh 'Abdullah Is A \ not a man to 1st the grass grow under his feet, and would very soon except ' 'Abdullah J and you had better stop this'. minutea later the whole mweting broke up. Ahmad got back to his house a little after U p.m., and at once sent everything and is writing to I bn Sa'ud accordingly, but I fancy gerated. Another theory is that Shaikh Ahmad is writing to Ibn The Present would have seemed such a good opportunity for the to have quite lost his faith in us for the time being, he presumabj extend his power from the desert into the tqwn.

Presumably as a result of the discussion between shaikh Ahmad and /Q ( .*/ Shaikh Abdullah as~3Kiim on the ilth July * which was apparently conducted by -neans of notes passed between their reapectiT# houses by the hand of KhSn BahSdur aulla Salih - Shaikh .Ahmad has written a lette:- to Ibn Sa'ud. After thanking him for hie kindness to Shaikh 'Abdullah and for his presents, he is oelieved to have said that he approvee in principle to the propotui put forward by 'Abdullah, he wishes the friendship between himself and Ifcn Sa’Od to be firmly eawbllshed, as he is as it were his son, and all he has u, under hie orders. In view of the vicissitudes of the time, however, he has certain stipulations to wake, which he could not well state at present, but would do c 0 if Ibn Ba'Gfl told hin to.

These reports show that Fhaikh Abdulla as-Salim managed to achieve a great d^al more than was represented in my despatch Ho. 371-3 dated 10th July and , in my opinion, disclose a most dangerous intrigue that must at no distant date compel a strong declaration of policy on the part of His Majesty's Government. por ready reference 1 may perhaps be permitted to remin4 Your Grace that Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir , the recognised ruling chief of Kuwait and Shaikh Abdulla ae-Salim are first cousins, being the eldest seas of Shaikhs Jablr al-MubaraK and Salim al-Mubarak who each i** thtir turn were successive Shaikhs of Kuwait after their father , the famous Snaikh Mubarak. The two grandsons seem to have inherited tm a in a marked degree , their fathers' characteristics . shaikh Jabir was a stout easy-going man, more attached to his per sonal comfort than anything else in the world : Shaikh ?alim preferred a desert life, was rough and discourteous, a sour, dour fanatic witn strong pro-Wahabi leanings . How again the situation recurs . We have the present ruling chief recognised oy tfc* British Government easy-going, by no means lacking in social charm but unstable and unreliable , a fair type of the mixed population of Kuwait. And on the other hand we have his most formidable rival Shaikh Abdulla , claim ing to represent Nejd , active and enterprising and no bad typetype of the Tejada Wahihla . in ay teiefrrani No. 708 dated l/th July to the Political Agent, Kuwait, despatched on the receipt of the two aeaorunda that tone the enclosures to this despatch 1 have put into two lines the situation as 1 see it f if this soaewhat transparent Intrigue is allowed to go forward . Recent events both in Bahrain and Kuwait convince c*e that His highness the Sultan ol tfejd is pursuing the hereditary and very natural policy ol the Wahabis and seeking an out* let to the ge* . n Shaikh Abdulla is permitted to estab lish himself as the agent of the Sultan ol Nejd with a pow erful iniluence over Nejbi Immigrants , coolies, pearl-divezs, camelmen and icerohants we may expect at no diet nt date a coup d'etat which will get rid of ShaiKh Airaad and establish $;*lkh Abdulla in his place. 1 do not know if shaikh Abdulla would then continue to be a subservient tool in the hands of the Sultan of tfejd or whether he would attempt to break loose and establish his own independence , but the result in either o*se would be the same for if he should attempt to be tne Independent Shaikh 0 f Kuwait he would receive support from neither the Kuwait townsmen nor his he j ad a adherents and we should have the Akhwaa policy firmly established In Kuwait f whether through a subservient Shaikh or by an olfioial directly appointed by the Sultan ol Nejd . It is proverbially dangerous to prophesy but 1 think w® might then reasonably expect to have the Muscat Arms traffic problem repeated at Kuwait and , for one thing, the state of lra»i, in whatever form it may finally be estab lished , would never know rest for one moment. Ky telegram to Shaikh Ahmad may possibly Impose caution and It is pe haps unnecessary for me to assure your Grace that events Kuwait will be watohed by me with the most careful anxie for the next few months , but I cannot conceive for myzel and it is only with the utmost difficulty that we shall avoid a direct rupture with the Pul tan of Nejd • and 1 wc solicitt+€ dolioit th.« favour of lastruotionB aa to whether th# Pol- itioal H#flid«&gt;at la th« P^riiiau Gull and th* Political ^g*at£ ia Bahraia ano Kuwait ar* steadily and rtudiously to oembat th* latruBion of J*jdi influeaoe in th*a* independent principalities, protectorates ol Great Britain, without regre to the almost certain consequence of a direct ruptir* of relations with the Multan oi i/ejd . 1 am myself inclined to believe that the most d irect steps should b* taken to counteract this intrigue even, if necessary , going so far as to insist on the re moval of Shaikh ^.bdulla as-tfalim irom Kuwait or its vicinity. If 1 may be favoured with a clear declaration of policy 1 anticipate no diilloulty in taking the necessary steps to see that it is carried out . as affairs are likely to develop with dangerous rapidity 1 would request further that such a declaration ol policy may b* telegraphed to me. ‘fhe only alternative policy that occurs to me is to stand by and allow matters to develop. ?he natural devel- * o^ment will b* the grant of a seaport to tn* Bultan of JeJd , the establishment of our own Political Agent accredited to^/ the Multan of n'ejd at the port of Kuwait , which will make his vulnerable from the sea and possibly enable us to ex« cise some influence over his policy in tn* interior.

Merl' Bower , the Customs^deputed to examine Bahrain and Kuwait Customs by the Government of India fxom Bombay , is now actually in Bahrain and I am afraid , judging from the delay that has already taken place , that there is very little chance of my obtaining a satisfactory reply to my despatch No . 2 j 8 ~S dated Bushire, 20th June lj23, in which 1 sketched out my notions for an adjustment of this Customs dispute and asked permission to go ahead. Even supposing that 1 received that permission, by the time that 1 had got into communicati on with Bin Saud and obtained his consent to set forward proposals I am afraid that 1 shall be off to Europe. Still , my ideas are on the file and it is possible that my successor may like to continue on these lines . For th e present I am not passing on your memorandum first cited to Colonies because I lack information as to what would be the result of an acceptance of the very heavy dues proposed by Bin Saud as reported in your memorandum. It seems to me that it would be advisable to compare the Kuwait position if these dues were accepted ,with goods ex ported direct from Irai to Neid either via Zubair or even possibly from Kriamisiyah* Entry dues in Irap are no doubt very high indeed but possibly they have arrangements allowing for a rebate or drawback or whatever may f ip may be the technical customs term , lor poods transported via Basrah to Central Arabia . as you are now in Mobammerah and probably well acquainted with Wilson at Basrah,it occurs to me that you might usefully examine this aspect of the question in demi-official corraspondence with him . There may be nothing, in it and perhaps it would be well to avoid raising some similar difficulty for Ira i with Bin Baud ,but I shall be very interested to learn your views on this part of the subject and they might help my successor to put up seme reasonable comments on Bin gaud's proposals when he forwards them to the Secretary of State for the Colonies . . 2 &gt; pylori, J'TL fa ycsitsz- £&gt;. trf /£&gt;? . +9 sA. aAA c/xiAP us&amp;frh. $ /z^picr~ ruzsy 'Tieoc^ ^ AT*(/3awza^ O'* A) locfizJb'/iT&lt;u.JWtS' T&amp;rnjZ.

L/\foi)g/ Ho. 2 -&lt;b^? of 1923 * British Residency and 0 oneulate—General, Bushire, 19 th Gotoher 1923- To His Highness Imam Sir ^hdul nziz Ihn Abdul Rahman al Faisal al Sa'ud , G.C.l.fi., Sultan of Hejd and Dependencies. your Highness, When 1 had the pleasure of seeing your envoy Syed nashim at Bus hire 1 made tentative proposals to him an to how Your Highness would regard an attempt on my part to settle the dispute between Kuwait and Hejd on the subject of Customs dues on good imported via Kuwait into central Arabia, especially El Kaain and beyond. Syed Haahim replied that he had no instructions but he ventured to express the hope 'Mvb and opinion that Your Highness would be ready to fall in with any reasonable proposals for putting an ©nd to a state of affairs which was equally damaging to Kuwait trade and Your Highness* subjects in the interior. Acting on that hope 1 have addressed His Majesty’s Secretary 0 f State for the Colonies and have received his approval to do what 1 can in the matter. Colonel Trevor to whom I have handed over charge of the Persian Gulf Residency yesterday, has said that he will be obliged if 1 will kindly endeavour to get this question settled during the forthcoming conference at Kuwait if the r latter is finally approved . Your Highness is no doubt aware that there is at present a Customs expert from the Bombay Customs , an Englishman who is at present engaged in reorganizing the working of the Bahrain Customs and 1 think it would be of very great benefit to all concerned if this gentleman, who2 who is thorougnly skilled and experienced in Customs matters t were to study the question of imports to Central .arabia via Kuwait and give us the benefit of his exper ience and guidance in these matters . He would no doubt be able to devise means by which imports into Nejd were pro -perly classified and if your Highness thinks it advisable, arrange for clear forms , of course written in .Arabic , by which Your Highness* representatives at such places as Buraidah and ^nizeh would be able to see at a glance what goods had left by a specified Kaji^ah from Kuwait , axid facilitate the task of Your Highness' representatives in collecting such additional dues as Your Highness might deem necessary. 1 have been informed that Your Highness has to 14 Shaikh Ahmed that you cannot consent to anything less than 7% on all goods imported, for yourself. Whether this is a fact or not 1 am not fully aware,but such a condition of itself would land Shaikh Ahmed in di^i^-oulties as such a duty is much higher than those already in force in Kuwait Arab and indeed on the w hole/.iittoral of the Persian Gulf from Muscat upwards. Your Highness is no doubt well aware that much of the prosperity of the Arab littoral is due to the fact that the rulers have had the good sense to keep the duties low. At present the inquiries 0 f Major More go to show that the general rate of duty is cons x.dea ably less than 4# j and 1 do n ot think that Shaikh Ahmed could impose a higher duty than 5 ^ ad valorem. The rough plan which 1 sketch out for Your Highness' approval, to be varied by subsequent discussion is that (1) the door of trade through Kuwait to Central Arabia should be thrown open by Your Highness 0 n condition that (a) a scientific 5 % ad valorem duty should be coll ected on all goods imported to Central Arabia via hejd: (b) the respective shares of Kuwait and Nejd should be*be settled by negotation: (o) the Customs due on Imports to Central Arabia vi a iTeJd should b® oollected by a qualifi^ olerk the immediate supervision of the political iigent, Kjwait, and the Kuwait and N#Jd shares determined for the period of one year ^ (d) at the termination of the year a cash valuation should be formed of the shafce of the duties that mig t reasonably be expected to aooxLae to ifejd and d n-jned would undertake to pay the s um arrived at for a period of ,say , fAve or ten years wnen, on six months' notice by either party, a similar arrangement might be come to for the r e-valuation of the Nejd share . Failing such not ice the agreement to be continued and Kuwait to pa^ t e Nejd share as valued above. (e) If ^our Highness thinks it really necessary , thougli I am inolinwi to d.preoate suoli a couth. «a likely to lead to oorreapondenoe, inoreaa^i expease la oolleotioa, diapubes and smuggling, the organization of a system &lt;M by which kajLaf aha should be bound to produce on their »rrivil at principal towns m Central Arabia, certified invoices Q f the P oods theyoarry,on wnioh Tfour Highness' off icials could collect additional dues at Your Highness ' discretion, might be considered. ■rne Hnaikh of Kuwait has agreed in principle to some such arrangement and 1 think it promises the best ^ ohance of a settlement,^ Your Highness would see that * e envoy you send to the inference is also given full power to make the best arrangement possible on the above lines 1 trust that there will be no great difficulty. your Highness knows my kindly feelings for Kuwait, the first post in Arabia at which 1 had the honour to serve , and 1 feel sure also that y 0 ur Highne m too retains a kindly reoollection of the town from wnioh your Highness started youryour oar©©* of conquest and glory, and so 1 beg personally to intercede with Your Hignness to see that Kuwait trade is not seriously damaged and to beg for Your Highness' kindly consideration in thi© matter. One point remains: the expenaea of the Customs off iced* deputed from Bombay will have to be met and 1 think a pound sum of &amp; 2 ,000/- is tne utmost which we shall have to ask from Yo^ Highness in payment for his services . Kuwait will of course have to meet the other half which f 1 repeat, should not exceed Rs 2 , 000 /-* 1 shall use my oest endeavours to make it less. Usual Ending. Sd/- S. G.

ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY. 1 . 924 . l.'y dear lore. LATHDlire OF PACK:jD CHS Ahmed 11 Ghanim our Agent at Koweit informs us that he applied to the Customs Authorities for permission himself to land the recent consignment of Packed Cils from our Steamer s.s.'kHUZISTAi:' on to the Customs VTharf, but tr.is was not granted f and the Customs Authorities insisted on landing the cargo in craft engaged by them. The Customs charges for hire of craft and eoolies are Dollars 15 (about Rs.28/-) per hundred cases, whereas if our Agent were allowed to make his own arrangements for landing the cargo he would only have to pay from Rs.io/- to As.12/- for the hire of a boat carrying 500 cases and As.2/8 per ICC tins for coolies to unload the cargo on to the Customs '.Vharf. You will agree that the Customs Charges for landing cargo are most excessive, and I am writing to ask if y° u could obtain permission from the Chaikh of howeit for our Agent to land future consignments from the 'EHUZISTAif'- ( 2 ) . V A S e • s h a (ooBTimnmj o'a niK:i.elf. Unless the Shaikh agrees to this or to considerable reduction of the Customs landing Charges, we shall be unable to use the 'EHUZI3TAJ?' for taking supplies of Packed Oils to koweit, as the whole cost 0 * tranB Port from Ibadan to koweit by native craft is about H8 * 1 5/- P 0r hundred cases for freight and Hs.2/8 per hundred tins for unloading at koweit, which comes to much less than the Customs landing Charges from the 'iHUZISTAH' alone. I do not know on what basis ordinary native boats are allowed to land oil without restriction, whereas ocean steamers are compelled to do so through the Customs; moreover is the latter rule enforced in the case of other ocean steamers, with general cargo such as the B.I. ships ? j shall be very grateful, therefore, if you could let me have a note on the subject with advice as to the best method of approaching the Shaikh in the matter. Yours sincerely.a * Mo. »tU-8. 'Si \y\ Folltloal k&amp;mnaj, KUWAIT. Septttntwr 1984 , Mj d«ap Jaok» t In r*&amp;lj to jour lottur Ko.iVV 3 ? of Gth Septombor.

This balance varies considerably for different articles, and • assuming, of course, that there is no demurrege • is as high as OP per cent in the case of miscellaneous packageTh« abov* only Rppli#B to at# aw era, and Balling boats which are too larga to go into tha Cuatona thasaalTas ara llghtarad in tha ati*aasi undar private arranganenta.

This arx^ngenent no doubt has disadvantages 9 but it does ensure the efficient lightering of ateaners. It is tme that in the case of packed oil the surplu charged certainly seems excessive, being at least 6c per cent according to the most moderate estimate, and X dare say I oould induce the bhaikh to reduce it a dollar or two and will try if you wish me to do so. X am not at all sure, however, that it would be to your Interest for me to do so at the present Juncture, and I am certain I oould not get it reduced sufficiently to make steamer transport compare in any way favourably with transport by native craft so far as this port is concerned. Xour Agent, Ahmad ai-Ohanim, who certainly appears to have your interests at heart, and is himself a retired sea captain and knows what he is talking about* spoke to me on the subject after the 'Khusistan* came here the other day* He told me he thought you were most ill advised to think of using a steamer for a port as close to ‘Abbadnn as Kuwait - although no doubt it would be an advantage in the case of suire distant places - not only because of the high landing charges, but also because ofth» inevitable dnaage to tke oonei^naent if the llghtaring tooh plaee in anything but the o&amp;lne&amp;t weather; whereas with sailing boats of the type used, the oonsignnent could be landed straight onto the Custans Wharf with comparative ly no risk of damage.
