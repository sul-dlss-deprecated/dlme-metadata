I am to observe in this connexion that His- Majesty Consul General at Bushire in his letter of April 30th. to the Government of India, copy of v/hich was enclosed in your letter of June 6th, notes (paragraph 11) that the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast are opposed to any extension of British control, and I am to express a doubt whether such an extension necessarily carrying with it increased responsibility for the behaviour of these chiefs and more intimate connexion with their internsil politics would prove of ultimate advantage to His Majesty's Government.

H. M. S. &lt;f Fox ” at Tamb, jrJ July igi 1 . Sir, I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your telegram No. 96 of 8 th June, I proceeded to A1 Ajman on 22 nd June to examine Zora Khor:— ( 1 ) as to the depth of water on the bar ; ( 2 ) whether bar can be deepened ; ( 3 ) whether it is possible to improve the Khor so as to make it practic able for steamers or lighters. 2 . On 23 rd June, I proceeded with Lieutenant G. L. Hodson to examine the Khor, the entrance to which is the same as that to Ajman Khor. Zora Khor turns sharply to the North East, on entering, and in the first half mile there is six to ten feet of water at low tide on the North shore ; it then opens out into three comparatively large sheets of water. It being evident that the two branches to South and East were very shallow, I proceeded up the North East Khor but found that that also dried nearly over the whole extent at low water, leaving a narrow tortuous channel of one to two feet. This branch extends for miles up the Coast, and the natives say that at one time there was another entrance which a small boat could get through, though I could find no trace of it. The Hamryia Khor, which turns to the Southward, nearly meets Zora Khor and is only separated from it by some low sand-hills. 3 . On Friday, 23 rd June, I sent the Navigating Officer, Lieutenant Hodson, to request the permission of the Shaikh, Humaid bin Abdul Aziz, to put up some marks and a tide pole, and to request him to come off and see me. He refused everything in a rude manner and said he was too ill to come and see me. Next day, I sent for the Native Agent for Shargah and, on his arrival, again sent for the Shaikh. He came off at about 4 P.M., and I extracted an apology from him and an assurance that I might put up a tide pole and what marks I considered necessary. 4 . On Tuesday, 27 th June, I directed Lieutenant Hodson and Sub- Lieutenant C. H. Champness to proceed with the Survey ; they put up a tide pole and measured a base and, as there were no natural marks, I directed flags on boathook-staves to be put up, taking care that the flags represented no nationality. As soon as the flags were seen in the village of Ajman, the Shaikh sent to say that they must be taken down at once, that all the women and children had left and that the men were out with their rifles. I explained to the messenger exactly what the flags were for, and told the Shaikh that I insisted u J I’* \ i' that the flags and tide pole were to remain where they were, and that I expected him to protect them; during that afternoon and next day, there was much excitement in the village and stray shots fired, not at any of our party. rS }/) f c On Thursday 29 th June, having obtained what information I required, I sent a message in to the Shaikh to say that I did not require him to protect the flags after noon that day, and took them down, as_ I did not think it fair to expect him to keep up the flags any longer against the wild bloods of the village. 6 . A tracing of the Bar and entrance to the Khor is forwarded herewith, by which it will be seen that- ( 1 ) there is not more than two feet at low water on the Bar, which is all sand and, though it could easily be depened, I think that it would silt up again rapidly ; 1 ( 2 ) the entrance to the Khor being so narrow, would render it quite impossible to take even the smallest steamer into it ; ( 3 ) the North side of Zora Khor might be made quite suitable for lighters, as it is deep for some little distance along. 7 . In short, I do not think that the harbour without incurring great expense. Khor could be made into a suitable I have, etc., (Signed) JAMES C. TANCRED, Captain and S. N. 0., Persian Gulf.

Bushire, July 1911 , I have the honour to refer to the Senior Naval Officer’s “ Report on the Khor at Zora, near A1 Ajman ” to Your Excellency, dated 3 rd July 1911 , of which he has been good enough to forward me a copy. 2 . I have received simultaneously a report on the subject from the Residency Agent at Shargah, and also an allusion to it in a letter from Maskat, which indicate both, that our proceedings were not altogether unattended by the risk of an untoward incident, and that an account of them have reached Maskat in a form which has given rise to resentful comment there. 3 . The tide pole difficulty at Debai last December will be within Your Excellency’s memory. In the present case I think that if I, or even the Residency Agent at Shargah, had been consulted before any action at all was taken at Zora or Ajman, all difficulty would have been obviated: and I beg that Your Excellency will be pleased to issue general instructions to the Commanders of His Majesty’s Ships on this Station, enjoining on them the present necessity for proceeding with extreme caution in these matters, and of consulting the Political Officers concerned, by letter or telegraph, before action, whenever the absolute urgency of the duty does not preclude that course. 4 . I would mention that the Shaikh of Ajman has only recently succeeded, and is the newest and most uncouth of all the Trucial Shaikhs.

My Lords request that they may be supplied with information concerning the scheme when received* I am, Che Under Secretary of Stat e, INDIA OFFICE* Sir, Your obedient Servant,CONFIDENTIAL. This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. India Office, 24th July 1911. In continuation of previous correspondence ending with the letter of this Office dated the 18th April last, communicating copy of the Viceroy’s telegram of 13th April 1911, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter* from the Government of India submitting a draft of the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. It will he * Foreign Department, Secret, No. 67, dated 8th June 1911 (with copy of Political remembered that, in view of the Despatch No. 28, dated 8th April 1897, local peculiarities to be provided for, appended). ■ L that Government were, requested to prepare the draft in the first instance. As regards what is said in the second paragraph of their letter, I am to observe that the Marquess of Crewe sees no reason to question the capacity of the Sheik to divest himself of his responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory, or the effective ness for its purpose of the document that he has signed as between the Sheikh and the British Government. But the question still remains whether the jurisdiction could safely be exercised over subjects of foreign civilized powers without the assent given generally or in the particular case of the power concerned. On this point the Secretary of State will be glad to receive the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before he proceeds further. The terms of the draft Order will, doubtless, receive the careful attention of Secretary Sir E. Grey, but Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no reason wdiy they should not be agreed to, and he accepts the conclusions of the Government of India on the special points referred to in paragraph 3 of their letter. He would also suggest that, if Sir E. Grey sees no objection, “ the Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council 1910,” be extended to Bahrein, and the Political Agent be empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public. Sir E. Grey will be able to judge whether this power will be best conferred on the Agent by the Order in Council or by separate notification. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, (Sd.) R. Ritchie. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 85.India Office, 15tli June 1911. Sir, With reference to the letter of this Office, dated the 23rd May 1911,regarding the proposed amendment of the “Persian Coast and * Communicating copy of correspon- Islands Order in Council, 190/, deuce ending with letter of Political I am directed by the Secretary Resident to Government of India, Ho. 527, ,, r. r t w ^ 5th March, 1911. oi State for India to enclose copy t Dated 5th June 1911. of a telegram! from the Government of India on the subject. It will be seen that they accept the views of His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire as to the particular amendments that should be provided for, namely— (1.) That Article 2 should read:—“The limits of this Order are “ Mohammerah with its dependencies, the coast and maritime “ provinces of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwettur, both “ inclusive, and the islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf “ of Oman, being within the dominions of His Majesty “ the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of “ Persia adjacent to the said coast and islands ” ; (2.) That in Article 3 the expression “ Mohammerah with its depen dencies ” should be defined as “ all places within the territory geographically known as Arabistan ” ; and (3.) That in the same Article “ Maritime Provinces ” should be defined as “ the Provinces of Arabistan, Pars, Laristan, “ Karman, Persian Baluchistan, and those districts by custom “ and for the‘time being included under the authority of the “ Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports.” The Earl of Crewe concurs with the Government of India as to the desirability of these alterations, and would suggest that, if Secretary Sir E. Gray sees no objection, the opinion of His Majesty’s Ministers at Tehran should be ascertained, and, in the case of his concurrence, that the necessary steps should be taken to issue an amending order. It will be seen that copies of both Colonel Cox’s letters, Nos. 462 and 527, dated the 26th February and the 5th March 1911, are in the possession of Sir G. Barclay. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) R. Ritchie. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.3 T-r «i No. 2938, dated Bushire, the 14th November 1909. From— Major A. P. Trevor, LA., First Assistant Resident in charge of Residency, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department telergram No. S-432, dated the 5th instant, regarding the transfer of the Consulate of Moham- merah from the limits of the Persia Order in Council to those of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. I should have been inclined to suggest that the word “ Coast ” might be defined in clause 3 (Interpretation clause) as suggested in the correspondence * Below Pro. No. 6 in a. Poiicai e., January 1883, forwarded under Foreign Department No8 - 1 ' 20 * * * * § Endorsement* No. 26S3-P., dated 22nd November 1878. This course seems to have been advocated by the Law Officers of the Crown in their letterf f Pro. No. ^ ibid. dated 9th August 1878. If a definition would suffice, the definition suggested by Colonel Eoss in m -h-j the enclosure to his letter J No. 13, dated 14th January 1879, and quoted by Major Cox in paragraph 3 of his letter No. 2023, dated 15th August 1909, seems to § Pro. No. 57 in External a., October 1890, Nos. me a very good one. In the 1889 order§ 65—115 - the term “ Persian Coast and Islands ’* was defined in the interpretation clause. I suppose however that some technical objection to adopting this course became apparent after the correspondence took place in 1878.4 I beg to suggest therefore that section 2 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order, 1907, might be amended to read as follows : “ 2 The limits of this order are the Coast of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwettar both inclusive and the Islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman being within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said Coast and Islands No. 626-G., dated Fort William, the 29th March 1910. From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Major Trevor’s letter No. 2938, dated the 14th November 1909, regarding the transfer of the Consulate of Mohammerah from the limits of the Persia Order in Council to those of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 2. I am to point out that the amendment proposed by Major Trevor would not cover the case of Ahwaz, which you consider it desirable to include within the limits of the Order. To effect this object, Article 2, Part I, of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,” might be altered so as to read as follows:— “2. The limits of this Order are Mohammerah with its dependencies, the coast of Persia from Mohammerah to Gwetter, both inclusive, and the islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, being within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said coast and islands} and the expression “ Mohammerah, with dependencies, might be defined in Article 3 either as— “ all places within the regular districts included in Southern Arabistan, * or as “all places within the territory geographically known as Arabistan.” I am to request that you will kindly favour the Government of India with your opinion in the matter.

I I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 626-G., dated 29th March 1910, regarding the transfer of the Consulate of Mohammerah from the limits of the Persia Order in Council to those of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 2. I beg to express my concurrence in the alteration to Article 2 suggested in the second paragraph of your letter above quoted ; as regards the interpreta tion to be attached to the expression “ Mohammerah with dependencies,” I1 V Wtll 10 m 2938, ■tool )ftlie iod! ffiiii ‘eRiai leadas lei ii mt, leat ia ^ S would recommend the adoption of the second alternative definition in Article 3 suggested by the Government of India, namely, “ all places within the territory geographically known as Arabistan.” 3. If this alteration be approved, the judicial powers of the Consul for Arabistan at Mohammerah will then be co-terminous with his Consular District, in which Ahwaz is included. 4. I beg leave to deal with the question oE boundaries of Consular Courts generally, raised by your telegram No. 223-S. of the 7th April 1910, in a separate communication, in case its discussion should obscure the present question, which seems capable of independent settlement on its merits. 5. The point at present under reference involves some aspects of the rela tive positions occupied in regard to one another by His ^Majesty s Itepresenta* tives at Mohammerah and Ahwaz which it was inconvenient to raise with the Government of India and His Majesty’s Legation during the tenure of an acting incumbent at Mohammerah} I therefore ventured to delay submission of my reply, but regret that the delay has been longer than I anticipated. 6. Should the proposals in regard to the relative functions and spheres of the Consulates at Mohammerah and Ahwaz which I have put forward in my letter No. 461, dated 26th February, meet with the approval of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister, it will be unnecessary to gazette the incum bent of the Ahwaz Consulate as a First Class Magistrate, as suggested in the last paragraph of my letter No. 2023 of 15th August 1909, as His Majesty s Consul at Mohammerah alone will be invested with judicial functions within the Arabistan district under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. 7.

C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department Telegram No. S-223 of the 7th April 1910 calling for information as to the places and districts now under the jurisdiction of the Persia Order in Council, 1889 and the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council, 1907, and the exact geographical boundary between areas subject to these Orders. In my letter No. 462 of the 26th February 1911, I asked leave to deal with this question in a separate communication, and now beg to submit my observa tions. 2. It will be convenient in the first place to consider the boundaries of Courts formally established under the Persia Order in Council, which fall within the sphere of this Residency. They are two in number and are estab lished at Mohammerah aud Ahwaz respectively, while His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire holds a King's Commission as Consul-General for Pars, Khuzistan* and Laristan and the district •IncludesArabian. of Lingah and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the dominions of Persia. No Provincial Court, however, has been established under the Order in Council, at Bushire. Similarly no provincial Court exists at Karman, which is within the sphere of this Residency, nor at Shiraz. 3. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah was authorised in 1892 Minister to Resident, No. 33, dated 29th November to hold a Consular CoUl’t at Mohammera 1892 . “ in and for his district ” under the Persia Order in Council. In 1906 His Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Arabistan was authorised to hold a Provincial Court “ in and for Arabistan 25 uVFSfr er i 9 O 05 . eSiaent ’ Tele &amp; ram No&lt; 32 ’ dated under the Persia Order in Council. The (2) Resident to Foreign, No. 474, dated 3rd Feb. Courts thus have at present indepen- TOar y 190S - dent and concurrent jurisdiction in the province of Arahistan. Incidentally 1 would observe here that as the result of the developments which have taken place in Mohammerah territory during the last 2 years, this arrangement has been found to need revision, an( l sugges tions in that direction have been made in my letter No. 462 of 26th February 1911 above cited. 4. Three Consular Courts are established under the Persian Coasts Order in Council, 1907 ; at Bushire, Lingah, and Bandar Abbas respectively ; whilst at Jashk and Charbar the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs exercises jurisdiction under the superintendence of the Resident and Consul-General. I will deal with each of these Courts seriatim. 5. Bushire .—The judicial jurisdiction of the Kesident and Consul-General Article 2. The limits of this Order are the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, being within the dominions of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, including the territorial waters of Persia adjacent to the said Coast aud Islands. Paragraph 3. “Inland Persia” means the ter ritories and dominions of the Shah of Persia so far as are not included within the limits of this Order. and His judicial Assistant at Bushire, is exercisable within the limits of the Order as at present defined in paragraph 2 thereof. This definition, however, is obviously an unsatisfactory one, as the word “ Coast ” is nowhere defined, and it is apparently left to the Consul-General to determine, in any particular case under Article 62 of the Order, whether a place is or is not within his jurisdiction. 62. If a question arises whether any place is or is not within the Persian Coast and Islands for the purposes of this Order, it shall be referred to the Consul-General, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall he conclusive on the question and shall be taken judicial notice of by the High Court of Bom bay and by any Court established under this Order.8 It may be mentioned that the Law Officers of the Crown recommended in 86 (Political), India Office to Government of India, 187 S that the WOrd ‘‘Coast should b© dated 19 th September 1878. defined, but this appears to have been considered unnecessary. 6 .

It will be seen from the foregoing summary that under existing pro visions whilst the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and his Pirst Assistant have judicial powers over the whole of the Persian Coast, from the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab to Gwettar Bay, the limits of the judicial powers of the Assist ant Residents at Lingah and Bandar Abbas only extend, along the coast, to the eastern boundary of the Minab district (which touches the sea between Ziarat and Bandaram). The tract between the latter boundary and Jashk Tele graph Station, comprising the district of Biyaban and a small strip of the Jashk district, forms a hiatus, in which no judicial officer subordinate to the Residency exercises jurisdiction. Prom Jashk to Charbar the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs does exer cise judicial powers, but only within the local limits of the Telegraph Stations at those ports and along the alignment of the telegraph line connecting them. 10 . No Provincial Courts have been established for the Consulates at Karman and Shiraz, and consequently were the incumbents of these posts to take judicial action under either Order-in-Council their powers might be called into question. The fact is, as an examination of the definitions figuring at the commence ment of the two Orders will demonstrate, that no precise boundary between them has been laid down ; and under present conditions, while His Majesty’s Consuls at Shiraz and Karman exercise no specific judicial powers within their spheres, it would at the same time seem to be an undue strain on the interpre tation of the Coast and Islands Order in Council, as at present worded, to claim for the Consul General at Bushire jurisdiction under that Order, either in the hinterland of the maritime provinces of Pars, Laristan and Lingah (which are covered by his Commission); or in Karman and Dependencies (including Persian Baluchistan and Mekran) which have always been in his sphere as Resident but are not provided for in his Consular Commission. It may be mentioned here in passing that the convenience of the inclusion in the latter instrument, of Karman and Dependencies, as well as of Arabistan, was suggested by Colonel Ross in Appendix I of his letter No. 13, dated 14th January 1879 to the Government of India when discussing the draft Order. 11. Thus, having regard to the fact that only offences committed within the limits of the Order in Council under which a particular Court has been constituted, can be tried in that Court, and that in consequence parts of Persia beyond the limits of one Order are treated for judicial purposes as foreign terri tory by Courts established under that Order, the position is plainly one that9 ♦ may at any time lead to grave inconvenience. For example; at present a person deported from Karman to Bombay could return to Bushire or Bandar Abbas with impunity ; again, property in Karman could not be distrained in execution of a decree passed in the Court at Bandar Abbas, unless proceedings were commenced afresh in Karman. 12. A consideration of the foregoing review of our judicial position in Southern Persia under the two Orders in Council can scarcely result in any conclusion but that the state of affairs is defective and unsatisfactory and demands readjustment; but before venturing to make any proposals in the latter direction, it will be convenient if I examine the circumstances which gave rise to the Present Order in Council and the motives which actuated its authors. 13. In 1866 the Foreign Office instructed Mr. Logies, then the Judge and Consul-General at Constantinople, to prepare the draft of a Foreign J urisdiction Order in Council for Persia, and forwarded to him a tentative draft drawn up by their Law Officers for the whole of that country. The Foreign Office having proposed that the Resident at Bushire should communicate with Mr. Logies, the then Resident, Colonel Pelly, did so by letter on the 3rd October 1866. This letter contemplated that the arrange ments for the littoral of the Gulf should be distinct from those for the interior. Correspondence on the subject continued for ten years and in 1877 Lord Salisbury in a Despatch dated 11th April stated that he entertained no doubt that Her Majesty had extra territorial jurisdiction in Persia, especially in the Gulf. He suggested that in lieu of an Order in Council applying to the whole of Persia an Order should in the first instance be issued applying to the Persian shore of the Gulf only and “not assuming more jurisdiction than was per mitted, but going to the undoubted extent of that jurisdiction.” In order to enable the Resident and his Assistants to deal diplomatically with cases where necessary he considered it essential that the Resident at Bushire, his two Assistants and Uncovenanted Assistant should be commis sioned as Consul-General, Consuls and Vice-Consul. At that time His Majesty’s Government was represented in the Persian Gulf by the Political Resident at Bushire with his staff and by a Political Agent at Maskat. There were no Consular Officers at Karmanshah, Shiraz, Mohammerah, Ispahan, Karman or elsewhere in Central and Southern Persia, as at present. 14. After further correspondence it was determined that the judicial functions of the officers in the Gulf should be disconnected from their Consular powers ; and that the Foreign Jurisdiction Order should be worked by Judicial Commissioners having concurrent jurisdiction over .the whole territory com prised in the Order, and nominated by the Governor-General in India, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for India in Council. It was further decided that the Resident at Bushire should at once be commissioned as Consul-General for the province of Pars and the Persian Coast and Islands, the question of Consular powers for his subordinates stand ing over pending suggestions from the Government of India. As was pointed out in a Memorandum by Mr. F. S. Reilly, apparently one of the Law Officers of the Crown, the Order differed considerably in general character from other Foreign Jurisdiction Orders. This difference arose, he said, mainly from the nature of the official position of the Officers by whom the Order was to be worked, whose subordination was not to the Imperial Gov ernment but to the Government of India. Further correspondence on points of detail followed and it was not until 1889 that the Order in Council for the Persian Coasts and Islands was issued, simultaneously with one for Persia, The former Order underwent revision in 1907, but its special characteris tics remained substantially unaltered^10 ,« Meanwhile, in the Tears 1903-06, political exigencies led to the estab- 10 . x\Leanwiin«, 1 ^‘v^P.ronsulates at Karmanshah, Ahwaz, Shiraz, lishraent ot Consulate _ tliese was added in 1909 a Vice-Consulate at Kavman and Bandar A ’ . . wers f or our officers at Bandar Abbas and Lingah. The Vjest?*^ ^ j^^establishment of those posts, but the Official necessitteof the Consulates at Karman and Shiraz seem to have been overlooked. . . in The further recommendation which I now venture to make in con- nf tw submitted in mv letter No. 462, above quoted, with the object tarnation of that si . ini ; our judicial position in Southern Persia, is UiaUbf limits D of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Connell he laid down in section 2 of the Order as, “ Mohammerah with its dependencies ; the Coast end maritime prwmcm Monammera to Gwettar both inclusive and the Islands of the of Persia from islo within the dominions of His Majesty r-i. ,o ft. said Coast and Islands.” “ Maritime provinces ” might be defined in section 3 as “ the provinces of . W r f aristan Karman, Persian Baluchistan and those districts by .uftorll, c&lt; ft. r.™ Governor of the Gulf Ports. 17 Such an alteration would enable His Majesty’s Consul at Harman, on heiii dulv empowered under the Order, to take cognizance o all offences com- b Vf g /Sln^the Consular jurisdiction and to dispose of them according to judfcTaf action between onr political officers on either side of the frontier easier than hitherto. . It would enable His Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars to take judicial cognizance of all offences committed within his consular jurisdiction and would P\aee under his judicial control those Consulates now administratively within his sphere. It would further secure that officers of the Government of_ India would administer justice in accordance with Indian Codes, the latter being, 1 W1 irenerallv admitted, more suitable to conditions obtaining in Persia, and parti cularly in Southern Persia, than the somewhat complicated system indicated in the Persia Order in Council. J8 The position of the Shiraz Consulate is already anomalous, as that centre is the capital of Pars, of which the Resident at Bushire is Con u General and is his summer residence; experience has shown, moreover, that it would in practice be highly inconvenient and detrimental to the public service to ffivScr the PoUtica°l Resident in the Persian Gulf from Judicial and Consular Authority in Pars. This anomaly will not, it is true, be removed should the P r0 Pf al ® I have detailed above commend themselves to the Goyernmentoflndiaand His Majesty’s Minister, for the Persian Coast and Islands Order « Cmmcd wffi then apply‘to the whole of Pars. There is no reason, however, why this shoffid be a source of embarrassment to His Majesty’s Consul at that place.

His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief at an interview accorded to the Electrical Engineer-in-Chief was of opinion that wireless stations should he established at Henjam (the station at Task being removed), Bushire, Behai, Bahrain, and Kuwait, while a portable station might be provided at Lmgah for use there when required. He agreed to the proposal that the stations at Bushire and Henjam should be of 3 Kilowatt output while those at Debai, Bahrain and Kuwait should be Kilowatt. Bushire would then he able to communicate with Henjam, Bahrain and Kuwait with Bushire, and Debai with Henjam. The estimates put up herewith allow for stations as indicated above. The following points call forireference :— Heniam and Bushire are to provide a 24-hour service and for this pur- nose four operators would be required in each station. The Director, ^ er s ian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, informed me that there are at present, at Henjam, Smiitm operators whose work is very light and whose services could therefore be utilised in the wireless station. This estimate, therefore, only provides for two additional operators at Henjam, and similarly the estimate for quarters is only for two additional operators. Quarters for the staff are understood to be already available at Bushire. The remaining stations are to provide a 12 -hour service and two operators at each station are therefore estimated for. The operators in charge of all these stations will require to be possessed of considerable technical knowledge-charge pay at Ks. 50 per mensem is there fore allowed in the estimate. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief mentioned that sites were available at all the places recommended in this proposal, but suggested that it might be desirable for other than technical reasons to purchase or rent a site at Kuwait. As regards the initial cost of conveying the personnel to the stations when they have been erected, no amount has been entered in the estimate / as no in formation is available to show whence they will be obtained. In accordance with His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s sug- cestions of a portable station for Lingah, alternative estimates are put up, otic livino- the cost oTa permanent installation with buildings etc., and the other merely giving the cost of provision at Lingah of a portable station without nllowino' for anv recurring expenditure. It should be pointed out tha e Sgl dfiference between cost of plant for the permanent station and cos of a portable station is due partly to the extra cost of masts in a permanent scheme but chieflv to the fact that the permanent scheme allows foi a l a Kilowatt Station! not because this would be essential for the ranges over winch communi cation from Lingah would he required, hut in order, as far as possible, to avoid a multiplication of different patterns for machinery and apparatus. It does not appear that any reduction can be made m the cost of the Heniam Station by utilising any of the gear from .Task, as not only will tvpe of gear installed at Heniam be radically different from that at Jask, but it will presumably be necessary to maintain the station at Jask until Henjam is Completed, and it would then perhaps be preferable to treat the two masts at j as ] c the only part of this station useful elsewhere—as spare stores to be used in cases of any renewals being required. The cost of plant has been worked out from figures previously supplied by the Marconi Co. for somewhat similar installations. The establishment charges and cost of buildings are based on figures ob tained from the Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph De- partment.Minute Paper.

Prom—His Excellency Rkar-Admtral Edmond J. W. Slade, Naval Commander- in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, T 0 —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. Be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the following remarks on the general situation on the Trucial Coast of the Persian Gulf. 2. Reports from the ships and boats stationed on that coast show that everything is quiet there, and as far as can be seen the Debai incident has not had the effect of inflaming the Arab against the European, as stated in some of the Indian newspapers. It is quite true that the Shaikh of Debai is still trying to prevent any Europeans from settling in his town, and in this he is probably encouraged by the owners of the pearl dhows, who fear investigation into their method of dealing with the divers, most of whom are said to be slaves.^ It is, however, more bluff than anything else, and if the question were taken in hand seriously, I feel sure that a settlement could be arrived at without more bloodshed. 3. I would suggest that the best way of bringing this about would be to proceed with the erection of the Wireless Telegraphy Station, the site for which was selected by Captain A. T. Hunt in conjunction with the Shaikh. The latter definitely agreed to allow the telegraph to be installed as part of the terms of the ultimatum which was accepted by him on the 29th December 1910. If he is not made to abide by these terms, he may give considerable trouble in the future, when it may become necessary in the interests of the whole Trucial Coast to force the various Shaikhs to accept a c&lt;rtain measure of British control for their own protection against Foreign Powers. I think the difficulty of dealing with them has been exaggerated, and is not so great as would appear at first sight. Although looming large on paper these Shaikhs are in reality very small men. They have not any cohesion, and each town acts almost entirely in what it considers to be its own interests, quite independently of anything that the others may think. 4 The question which is likely to arise in a very short time is that of the pearl fisheries. Great Britain has policed and maintained order on these banks for nearly a century, but as long as we have not, a definite status vis a vis the Arab tribes who use them, which is recognised by Foreign Powers we cannot enforce our control over any vessels on the hanks who may fly the colours of France, Germany, or other European countries. Firms in both France and Germany are reported to be considering wheiher they shall fit out pearling expeditions for the Persian Gulf, using dredges and all sorts of modern appliances, which, if carried out, would probably mean the speedy working out of the banks. 5 The Arab tribes who fish the banks are almost entirely dependent on the result of the season’s work for their livelihood, as agriculture or other pursuits are not possible for them. Even if the banks be not worked out, the competition introduced will seriously threaten the welfare of the dirers. 6 Of the tribes who regularly fish on tho banks Great Britain nominally controls the greater number. Others, such as those on the Katar Peninsula, have not made treaties with us, but they probably would do so with some little persuasion. Others, again, as at A1 Katif are under Turkish control • and lastly there is Kuwait, the position of the Shaikh of which is doubtful, to say the least of it, at the present moment. 7. As I have already pointed out, cohesion does not exist amongst the tribes and they cannot and will not act together. It therefore follows that, unless we are prepared to see them subjected to a competition which can but have one ending, the ruination of the Arab owner, and to see the prestige of Great Britain, as the Power that has for nearly a century looked after the interests of all the tribes in the Gulf, pricked like a bubble the moment that we find ourselves face to face with another European Power, we must take action beforehand and make such a position for ourselves, not only de facto4 but dejure, that we can impose the conditions under which pearl fishing shall be carried out by everybody who may wish to use the banks. 8 . In the first place, it seems to be necessary to proclaim to the world at large our Protectorate over the Trucial Coast, by issuing an Order in Council as is being done with respect to Bahrain. The order will have to be drawn a very elastic basis, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf will have to be given very large discretionary powers at first with regard to the administration. Some sort of control over the administration of the Chiefs will have to be introduced, and it is for this reason that I have urged the establishment of the Wireless Telegraphy Station at Debai as a commencement. 9. The greatest difficulty with which we shall be faced will be that of thp status of the pearl divers, and in this matter we must sh )w ourselves to be patient and somewhat more tolerant than usual. It would appear that only two alternatives face us; one is to introduce administrative action on the Trucial Coast slowly and carefully so as to bring the tribes more effectively under British guidance; and the other is to leave them alone and let their only property be exploited by none too scrupulous foreign firms, who would not care for the traditional owners of the pearl banks as long as they could make as much as possible out of them, and for Great Britain to lose every vestige of prestige that she may possess. 10. In the second place, we should enter into treaty relations with the Katar Chiefs, and induce them to act with us in this matter, and to depute us to represent their interests on the banks, agreeing to abide by our regulations. If they would accept a full Protectorate Treaty, so much the better. Similar action should be taken with regard to Kuwait in so far as deputing us to act for the Shaikh is concerned. As regards Bahrain, I have considered that place as definitely under British protection in a way that cannot be disputed. 11 . We should then issue and enforce regulations on the banks very similar to those which are already customary amongst the Arabs, but they should be published so that all should know of them. In particular the use of any dredge or other mechanical appliance for obtaining the oysters should be prohibited. The natural history of the oyster beds should also be investigated scientifically, as has been done in Ceylon, and the extent and position of all the pearl bearing beds in the Gulf definitely ascertained. In this way it is possible that gradual improvements may be introduced into the fisheries, and the yield of the banks increased. 12. An opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, dated 11 th February 1905, and transmitted to the Government of India on 31st March 1905, upon the question of the pearl fisheries, clearly points to the necessity of organising them in such a way as to make Great Britain’s prescriptive rights effective. If we do not do so, and let the matter stand over until what appears to be a more convenient season, the opportunity will go by for ever, and action will be left too late to save British position and prestige. It is for this reason that I venture to urge the Government not to let the time pass before taking the initial step with regard to Debai until all memory of the results of opposing Great Britain has passed away. No. 398—1-M., dated Simla, the 12th May 1911 (Secret). Endorsed by Marine Department. Copy of the foregoing forwarded to— The Foreign Department. The Chief of the General Staff.No. 1112, dated Bushire, the 30th April (received 8th May) 1911 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Golf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. At the conclusion of my letter No. 87 of the 8th of January, on the subject of the Debai incident, I stated that I should shortly be visiting the Trucial Coast again in connection with the Abu Musa case, and would then have an opportunity of gauging the effect of recent events on the public mind. I have since carried out the visit and now beg to lay the following before the Government of India. 2. On the coast generally I found conditions perfectly normal and the untoward incident at Debai appears to have had no harmful reaction on the rulers or the inhabitants of the other principalities. The Shaikhs themselves were as usual principally concerned with their own individual interests and wants and if they did take the trouble to make any enquiries from me regarding Debai affairs it was with an air of deference and detachment. They would ask, for instance : Did Government intend to appoint a British officer for the coast ? When was the telegraph station to be installed ? and so on. 3. At Debai itself, outwardly and commercially, the position appeared to ? be quite normal. When I landed the usual friendly or curious crowd was collected on the beach, and the life of the port seemed to be pursuing the even tenoyfr of its way; one heavily laden steamer had just discharged cargo, and left: another was discharging during my sojourn, and the British India Steam Navigation Co.’s Agent at Lingah informed me a day or two later of the fact that the Company’s steamers were at present taking more cargo to Debai than usual. The community of petty Persian traders, who, subsequent to the visit of the Admiral and myself, had temporarily betaken themselves to Lingah and Bandar Abbas,—after sending a mendacious round robin to various vernacular papers,—had all returned and were again plying their accustomed callings. The British Indians, too, seemed to have quite forgotten the events of two months ago and were solely concerned with the settlement of their petty commercial claims. The only concrete vestige of the recent outbreak lay in the fact that the relations of the last Shaikh of Debai, Makhtoom bin Hashar, who have always been a thorn in the side of the present ruler, and who had openly attributed the trouble with His Majesty’s ship to the ineptitude of Shaikh Butti’s rule and averred that it could never have happened under the regime of their deceased kinsman, still remained in camp at an oasis 7 or 8 miles inland. They were, however, ex pected to return after my visit, and I have no doubt have done so ere this. Meanwhile, their presence can well be spared. So much for the general situation at Debai. 4. The attitude of the Chief himself. The main difficulty throughout has been the unreliable personality and ! self-satisfied incompetence of Shaikh Butti bin Sohail. I do not think that in the abstract he has any wish to be otherwise than on cordial terms with Government and their representative, but provided always that he be left alone to enjoy what revenue falls in his way and be not asked to take any tiresome measures to prevent his subjects conducting themselves in any truculent way they please. If he is asked to take any action at all inconvenient to himself or to assert his authority as ruler in any particular manner, he has always failed to do so except under the strongest pressure. As an indication of his natural attitude of mind I may quote the following recent instance : — As the Government of India are aware, it was the inauguration of the oppressive Persian tariff of 1903 in the Persian ports which made it possible for Debai to supplant Lingah as a distributing centre of merchandise for the Arab coast. This was facilitated by the intelligent policy of the late ruler, Shaikh Makhtoom, who made Debai a free port as far as customs duty was concerned and contented himself with the levy of a warehouse or wharfage feeon each package landed. During the last few years the imports have continued to increase and the primitive accommodation provided has gradually become quite inadequate,—specially covered accommodation—and this has been a frequent source of complaint from British traders at Debai. During the past winter, which has been an abnormally wet and stormy one, a great deal of damage has thus accrued to perishable cargo lying on the wharf, and to mitigate °this the drainage of the floor and the provision of more roofing has become an urgent necessity. On my recent visit X was asked to exert influence with the Shaikh to induce him to' meet the merchants’ wishes in this respect and was assured by the traders that all they wanted could be done for 300 or 400 rppees, but that the Shaikh could not be got to go to the expense. When I pressed the matter upon the Shaikh his first rejoinder was to the following effect:— “ The roofed accommodation which I have provided is quite sufficient for the Debai cargo. It is true that I take warehouse fees on all packages, but I see no reason why I should spend money on the preservation of cargo which is intended for distribution to other ports. I do not want such cargo here and if traders choose to bring it that is their look out ”, After a good deal of discussion he ultimately promised me to comply with the representations of the traders in such a way as to remove their grounds of complaint, but it remains to be seen whether he will carry out his promise without further pressure. I must apologise for this diverson, but it supplies a useful illustration of the type of character with which one is dealing. 5 . The appointment of a British Agent. The only apparent and specific outcome of the recent events is that the Shaikh has been astute enough to make use of the “ Hyacinth ” incident as a pretext for a professed inability to answer for the safety of a European at Debai and thus indirectly to suggest to us that the appointment of any British official, whether for political or telegraph work, is not feasible for the present. Thus when just before my visit the British India Company, in the ordinary course of routine, sent a Eurasian employe to relieve the Persian, who was acting as their Agent at Debai, the Shaikh, who had received early information of his coming from the Persian whom he was intended to replace, had him met on board with a civil letter to the effect that, owing to the resentment still felt by the inhabitants who had lost relations in the recent fight, he was unable for the present to ensure the safety of any European and there fore could not allow him to land. It is of course conceivable that the Shaikh’s statement might have some foundation, but judging from what I saw and heard myself a few days later I cannot help thinking that his professed apprehensions were not altogether bona Jide and that he is simply making use of the incident of 24th December, in order to bring about a post ponement of the appointment of the European whom he thought Government might contemplate sending, either to take charge of the existing Agency or to manage the Telegraph Station. 6 Decent happenings have at all events placed beyond doubt what I always to some extent apprehended, namely, that the Shaikh of Debai does not welcome the idea of closer British supervision over the Trucial Coast, and that this sentiment is probably shared by the other Shaikhs. It is naturally a difficult one for the latter to express frankly to the representative of Govern ment, especially having regard to the considerations on which it is based, but the Shaikh of Debai, seeing that the “ Hyacinth ” incident has provided him with a useful indirect peg on which to air the sentiment, is making the most of the opening afforded him. The grounds underlying it were adumbrated in my telegram No. 115, dated the 3rd March 1909, and are not far to seek. They are undoubtedly based on the fear that whereas at present we are represented by an Arab Native Agent, who, by long residence on their coast and intermarriage with the daughters of the community, has become more or less a member of it; on the other hand, if a British officer were appointed , with a more pertentious house and flagstaff, the institution would become an | ever present reminder to the negro diving fraternity that in the case of realoppression they had a ready refuge at hand; with the result that generally speaking the treatment, by the Arab element, of this oppressed class would have to undergo amelioration. 7. Ten years ago our position on the Trucial Coast was specifically taken into review by the Government of India, and, in the course of the correspondence which then ensued, my predecessor wrote on the 12th December 1902 :— “ For all practical and necessary purposes the Trucial Chiefs may be considered to be under our protection and there is no necessity to make this protectorate more formal unless and until future developments in the Gulf make it advisable In the decade which has since passed there have undoubtedly been a good many developments, and, while all around them the maritime communities have made some measure of progress in the direction of civilization, the Trucial Chiefs have practically stood still. There has been no want of effort on the part of the representative of Government to cultivate and keep in touch with these Shaikhs, and I personally have been afforded much better opportunities than my predecessors for doing so. For whereas formerly the personal association of the Resident with them was as a rule limited to one formal visit during the year, my own visits have been very much more frequent. I have made two extensive land journeys at different times through their hinterland and have had to visit the coast frequently in connection with the collection of material for the Gulf Gazetteer. I know them all well individually, and in questions of succession, and internal politics inter se, they seem to be no less ready than of old to look to the Resident for arbitration in their disputes and difficulties, and to accept his decisions. But so far as their external relations are concerned and the display of any inclination on their part to move with the times, I regret that I can see no change at all. They remain in the same condition of bigoted ignorance as they did ten years ago and show not the least inclination to emerge from it. 8 . To revert for a few moments to past events. The Government of India are aware that Mr. New was appointed Vice-Consul at Lingah with the idea that we should be able to use him also for occasional sojourns at Debai, and thus make a beginning; for a better order of things. Although I was not entirely free from misgiving, I was hopeful when I addressed Govern ment in November that if I took Mr. New down to Debai in the “ Lawrence ” and stayed there a few days until he had had time to get on terms with the Shaikh I should be able to induce the latter to make him welcome there for a period, and that this would prepare the way for regular periodical sojourn. When the attack on the landing party of H.M.S. “Hyacinth” was reported, all my hopes in this direction were upset, and it seemed to me either that the *idea of bringing about better representation on the coast must be banished altogether for a long time to come, or else that the British officer must be installed as an item of the measures taken by us in connection with the attack on our blue-jackets. The Government of India considered the latter course out of the question, and meanwhile, as was inevitable in any case, the incident has since been made the subject of much organised misrepresent ation and hostile comment in the Turkish and vernacular press, and we seem further removed than ever from the certainty of being able to instal a British representative by friendly means. Moreover as far as Debai is concerned, and its present Shaikh, I fear that the same considerations will hold, so far as they apply in regard to the project for the installation of a wireless telegraph station. 9 In this connection I would observe that even if it were not indispensi- hl that the clerk in charge of the wireless should be an Englishman, a station ould hardly be inaugurated without a flag to cover it or a guard to protect it, C d under existing conditions, sceptical as I am of the bond fides of the Shaikh’s apprehensions, I doubt whether it would be wise to attempt to carry the asure through without the discretion and wherewithal to use force majeure •f 16 ecessary. But in any case I gather from His Excellency the Commander- ' -^hief that, even if the wireless station for Debai receives early sanction, i { ithere will he no question of its erection before the beginning of next cold weather, so that we have several months before us in which to watch the situation. 10 . In the meantime, I trust the Government of India will be pleased to take into their wise consideration the whole question of our relations with these Chiefs and the policy which we can best adopt towards them henceforward. I venture to express the personal view that, although many inconveniences will doubtless he attendant upon a tightening of our present easy control over them, the march of events and the developments of the general political outlook in the Gulf region make it advisable, and in any case will ultimately oblige us to take definite action in that direction. Already foreign merchants, e.g., Messrs. Wonckhaus, the German firm, Messrs. Rosenthal, the French pearl dealers, and our own subjects Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. have either sent or desired to send European representatives to embark in the trade of the Trucial Coast; yet at present the Government of India, and the Resident as their representative with the Trucial Shaikhs, possess inadequate constitutional and legal equipment for the exercise of functions which they may at any time be called upon to perform. In this connection the enaction of a simple Order in Council would now seem called for. 11 . But while, on the one hand, the disinclination of the Trucial Shaikhs to be subjected to any closer British supervision than that which they now enjoy, or suffer from, is largely based on ignorance and on considerations which will not stand the test of examination by the light of present day civili sation ; and while, owing to the increasing intensity of that light, our credit as a civilised Government will ultimately oblige us to make our supervision more exacting; yet, on the other hand, we shall doubtless wish to put ourselves, as far as we can, in the shoes of the rulers of these benighted principalities and regard with what sympathy we may their fear of the search-light. At any rate we need to make the process of evolution as easy for them as we can and to let it operate in the way calculated to draw upon ourselves the minimum amount of resentment and unpopularity. As far as I can see at present and having regard to the unreliability of the present Shaikh, any proposal that might be made in the near future for the location of a British officer at Behai, even as a periodical sojourner, will probably be met with opposition, real or engineered, and I fear there will be no greater certainty of putting the measure^through by purely amicable means than there was in December last, and that the installation of a telegraph station at Behai with European staff will be a little-less delicate operation. 12 . In these circumstances, it occurs to me that the little enclave of Zora, between Ajman and Bamriyeh, may be considered to offer us a convenient base and more simple means for the location of our telegraph station and the insertion of the wedge of more effective control. The situation and history of the Zora tract will be found described in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Its occupation has always been such an apple of discord among the Shaikhs themselves that we have been obliged to prohibit such occupation. Its position is central, and it possesses a good Khor on the Ajman side tor the use of native craft; while an anchorage could probably be found at some point off it, which would be no worse than those existing -at other ports along that coast. On shore we should start with a spacious and un obstructed tract of ground and it seems conceivable that if we were to make the place a free port for the import of merchandise for distribution, we might gradually gather round us a community of peaceful Indian and Arab traders, and that the place under our aegis might thus become a convenient centre for the spread of influence and civilisation, by example and contact, rather than by any sterner measures. The start would be made by the landing and installation of the staff and guard for the wireless station, with their gear and the necessary E. P. tents for their accommodation at the beginning of the cold weather. At the moment of their disembarkation the Shaikhs of Ajman and Hamriyeh, in the first instance, and then the Trucial Shaikhs generally, would be notifiedpersonally that, in order that the telegraph system might interfere as little as possible with their sensibilities or the populations of their towns, we had decided to locate it at Zora, and required tor it from all of them the respect ^ and protection to which it was entitled under treaty. Once our telegraph station was installed the rest would gradually follow, automatically, and we should thus he rendered quite independent of the co-operation or opposition of the Shaikh of Debai and his community. The Government of India may perhaps think the idea a visionary one, hut it seems to me to possess convenient possibilities, and I submit it respect fully for consideration. It will of course be understood that, in the foregoing paragraph, I have merely indicated very roughly the line on which I think we might proceed, and it goes without saying that should the suggestion commend itself to Government these lines would need to he carefully plotted out. With apologies for the length of this communication, of which I am sending a copy to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in that it has a bearing on the wireless question.

I am. 1 1CONFIDENTIAL No.87/1462•XXII COPY 'Highflyer” at Sirik, 26th April, 1911 Sir Be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council the following remarks on the general situation on the Trucial Coast of the Persian Gulf. 2. Reports from the ships and boats stationed on far as can be seen the Dibai incident has not had the effect of inflaming the Arab against the European as stated in some of the Indian newspapers. It is quite true that the Sheikh of Dibai is still trying to prevent any Europeans from settling in his town, and in this he is probably encouraged by the owners of the pearl dhows, who fear investigation into their method of dealing with the that coast show that everything is quiet there, and as divers, most of whom are said to be slaves. It is 1Captain A. T* Hunt in conjunction with the Sheikh* The latter definitely agreed to allow the telegraph to he installed as part of the terms of the ultimatum which was accepted by him on the 29th December, 1910. If he is not made to abide by these terms, he may give considerable trouble in the future, when it may become necessary in the interests of the whole Trucial Coast to force the various Sheikhs to accept a certain measure of British control for their own protection against Foreign Powers* I think the difficulty of dealing with them has been exaggerated, and is not so great as would appear at first sight. Although looming large on paper, these Sheikhs are in reality very small men* They have not any cohesion, and each town acts almost entirely in what it considers to be its own interests, quite independently of anything that the others may think* 4. The question which is likely to arise in a very short time is that of the Pearl Fisheries* Great Britain has policed and maintained order on these banks for nearly a century, but as long as we have not a definite status vis a vis the Ars&amp; tribes who use them, which is recognised by Foreign Powers, we cannot enforce our control over any vessels on the banks who may fly the colours of France, Germany, or other European Countries. Firms in both France and Germany are reported to be considering whether they shall fit out pearling expeditions for the Persian Gulf, using dredges and ail sorts of modem appliances, which, if carried out, would probably mean the speedy working out of the banks. 5 # The Arab tribes who fish the banks are almost entirely dependent on the result of the season^ work for their livelihood, as agriculture or other pursuits are not possiblepossible for them. Even if the banks be not worked out* the competition introduced will seriously threaten the wel fare of the divers. 6. Of the tribes who regularly fish on the banks Great Britain nominally controls the greater number. Others, such as those on the Katr Peninsula, have not made treaties with us, but they probably would do so with some little persuasion. Others again, as at A1 Katif, are under Turkish control; and lastly there is Kuwait, the position of the Sheikh of which is doubtful, to say the least of it, at the present moment. 7. As I have already pointed out, cohesion does not exist amongst the tribes, and they can not end will not act together. It therefore follows that, unless we are prepared to see them subjected to a competition which can but have one ending, the ruination of the Arab owner, and to see the prestige of Great Britain, as the Power that has for nearly a century looked after the interests of all the tribes in the Gulf, pricked like a bubble the moment that we find ourselves face to face with another European Power, we must take action beforehand and make such a position for ourselves, not only ”de facto” but M de jure”, that we can impose the conditions under which pearl fishing shall be carried out by everybody who may wish to use the banks. 1 8. In the first place it seems to be necessary to proclaim to the world at large our Protectorate over the Trucial Coast, by issuing an Order in Council as is being done with respect to Bahrain. The order will have to be drawn on a very elastic basis, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf will have to be given very large discretionary powers at first with regard to the administration. Some sort of control over the administration of the Chiefs will ^ 74 OrtU^ $6 cA H y-t f* t Cv+M , havehave to be introduced, and it is for this reason that I have urged the establishment of the Wireless Telegraphy Station at Dibai as a commencement. 9. The greatest difficulty with which we shall be faced will that of the status of the pearl divers, and in this matter we must dhow ourselves to be patient and somewhat more tolerant than usual. It would appear that only two alternatives face us; one is to introduce administrative action on the Trucial Coast slowly and care fully so as to bring the tribes more effectively under British guidance; and the other is to leave them alone and let their only property be exploited by none too scrupulous Foreign firms, who would not care for the traditional owners of the pearl banks as long as they could make as much as possible out of them, and for Breat Britain to lose every vestige of prestige that she may possess. 10. In the second place we should enter into treaty relations with the Katr chiefs, and induce them to act with us in this matter, and to depute us to represent their interests on the banks, agreeing to abide by our regulations. If they would accept a full Protectorate Treaty, so much the better. Similar action should be taken with regard to Kuwait In so far as deputing us to act for the Sheikh is concerned. As regards Bahrain, I have considered that place as definitely under British Protection in a way that cannot be disputed. 11. We should then issue and enforce regulations on the banks very similar to those which are already customary amongst the Arfcbs, but they should be published so that all should know of them. In particular the use of any dredge or other mechanical appliance for obtaining the oysters should be prohibited. The natural history of the oyster beds should* should also be investigated scientifically, as has bean done in Ceylon, and the extent and position of all the pearl bearing beds in the Gulf definitely ascertained. In this way it is possible that gradual piprovements may be introduced into the fisheries, and the yield of the banks increased. 12, An opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, dated 11th February, 1905, and transmitted to the Government of India on 31st March, 1905, upon the question of the Pearl Fisheries, clearly points to the necessity of organising them in such a way as to make Great Britain^ prescriptive rights effective. If we do not do so, and let the matter stand over until what appears to be a more convenient season, the opportunity will go by for ever, and action will be left too late to save British position and prestige. It is for this reason that I venture to urge the Government not to let the time pass before taking the initial step with regard to Bibai until all memory of the results of opposing Great Britain has passed away* I have the honour to be.

Will shortly address you by despatch respecting draft Bahrein Order in Council. From Viceroy, 2nd May 1911. Foreign Secret. Cox has information which makes it appear probable that Rosenthal Freres, of Paris, contemplate trying to obtain a concession to work pearl fisheries in Persian Gulf. He recommends that secret agreements be taken from Sheikh of Bahrein and Gulf maritime Arabs precluding them from granting concessions to foreigners. I think action somewhat similar to that approved in December 1905 regarding sponge exploration syndicate might be taken. Cox might be authorised to explain to Chiefs the great disadvantage to their own interests of granting concessions to foreigners, warn them against any such transaction, and endeavour to obtain assurances in writing that they will not grant any concessions. I shall be glad of authority to instruct him accordingly. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 23rd May 1911. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 2nd instant. Pearl fisheries. I approve proposed instructions. Distinction drawn by Law Officers between territorial and deeper waters should be borne in mind. See Mr. Brodrick’s Secret Despatch No. 8, of 31st March 1905, and my Secret Despatch No. 25, of 16th August 1907.India Office, London, 21st May 1909. Secret, No. 11. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, The proposals made in Your Excellency’s Secret letter No. 188, Proposed Oi'der in Council con- c l a ted the 14th November 1907, for ferring on the Political Agent at regularising the judicial powers Bahrein jurisdiction over British exercised by the Political Agent at subjects and foreigners in Bahrein, d -u • i .i • £ i J J v Bahrein, by the issue or an Order in Council placing both British subjects and foreigners under his jurisdiction, have been considered by His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the general question of the policy, political and com mercial, to be followed in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the change in the situation consequent upon the development of the Bagdad Railway scheme. 2. The general conclusion at which His Majesty’s Government have arrived is that “ the competition to which British trade in the Persian “ Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political “ object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are “ based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto “ been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German “ forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political influence would “ proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on “ our part, not having as its objective the development of material “ British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and “ commercially, by reason of the suspicions it would be likely to rouse.” 3. The proposals which you have made for the extension of the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Bahrein fall within the lines of policy approved by His Majesty’s Government. Their adoption would mark another stage in the development of the virtual protectorate which we exercise over Bahrein, to which the growing importance of the island as a centre of trade may be attributed. 4. It will tend to strengthen our position in Bahrein, and to remove risks of interference by other Powers, if jurisdiction over foreigners is placed in our hands. But our protectorate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising vuth other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction overtheir subjects by the Political Agent, it will be preferable that our action should be based on a request from the Sheikh to be relieved of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. When this has been arranged, an Order in Council can be issued. It does not seem expedient to make the Order in Council the medium of formally declaring a protectorate over Bahrein. Persian and Turkish claims to the sovereignty of the island have been repudiated by us in a form to preclude the necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia has formally abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognised, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territorv. In the present political conditions of lurkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could be represented as an attempt to utilise their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a protectorate might be regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. 5. I request that the Political Agent at Bahrein may be instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the island. 6. As regards British subjects, no difficulty arises in respect of the proposed Order in Council in view of the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861, and of the usage that has been established. 7. It will be convenient that the first draft of the Order in Council should be prepared by Your Excellency’s Government, with a view to providing for any local peculiarities that may require consideration. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn. \gecre.t . Commander-in-Chief's Office, Bombay 18th Llarch 1911.

From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. 'With, reference to Marine Department letter No. 504-1—A. D. M., dated 23rd December 1910, relative to the proposed establishment of permanent wireless stations at certain places in the Persian Gulf, be pleased to lay the following remarks before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. 2. My opinion, as expressed in the report of the Sub-Commitee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1908, upon the desirability of establishing wireless telegraph stations at the places enumerated in the Marine Depart ment letter under reply, has not undergone any change as the result of experi ence in the working of the stations as they exist on the East Indies Station at the present time, but I have come to the conclusion that the scheme then put forward might with advantage be modified. 3. I would, therefore, propose for the consideration of His Excellency in Council that the following equipment should be purchased and installed in the Persian Gulf:— Station. Approximate power. Radius of action. Lingah I Kw. 75 miles. Henjam \ » 100 &gt;» Debai 4 )) 100 )) Bahrain 2 )) 150 » Kuwait 2 7} 150 77 Bushire *4 7) 800 77 4. The object, as I understand it, is to connect the principal markets on the Arabian shore of the Gulf with the cable on the Persian shore, thus providing a satisfactory and economical means of communicating between those places and the Indian markets, and at the same time to retain the control of the communi cations in the hands of the Government of India. For this pm-pose, it is not at all necessary that each station should be able to communicate by wireless telegraphy directly with every other station, in fact it is better that they sriou not be able to do so. If necessary, however, the proposed stations would be able to communicate either by cable or by cable and wireless through those on the Persian Coast. It may further be observed that it is important that they should not be fitted with apparatus of greater power than is absolutely necessary for the work to be done, in order that the risk of interference with other stations in the vicinity may be reduced to a minimum. 5. A 300-mile station at Bushire would enable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to telegraph directly to any of the places named in paragraph 3, and to maintain communication with any of His Majesty s ships in the Gu . He would, therefore, be in a position to keep touch with everything that might be happening, and this, I think, is essential from a political point of view. 6 . It would be desirable that the R.I.M.S. Lawrence should also be fitted with a small installation, so that on the Political Besident proceeding on tour round the Gulf, he would still be in touch with the telegraph. 7. The cost of the scheme would probably work out at something very much smaller than that originally suggested, and I think that it would be far more efficient. The installation proposed for Lingah is quite small and could be erected on the Consulate. Those for Henjam and Debai would be about half the size of those now at Bombay and Task, while that for Bushire would be approximately the same as at Jask, and those at Kuwait and Bahrain would be somewhat smaller. 8 . With regard to the question of the most suitable installation, I would recommend the Marconi system in preference to any other. As far as ourexperience goes, it is the most reliable and efficient method of wireless signalling now on the market, and since all His Majesty’s ships are so fitted, the use of this system in the Persian Gulf stations would simplify the question of inter communication and would allow of the stations taking advantage of the assistance of the wireless staff in His Majesty’s ships, if at any time necessary. 9 . I may add that I shall be very glad to discuss the details of the scheme with any official whom the Government of India may depute for that purpose, and I will gladly place the services of the expert officers attached to my flagship at the disposal of the Government with a view to settling any technical questions which may arise.

Please refer to your letter No. 3593, 27th December 1908. The Admiral, who has been consulted, suggests wireless installations at Bushire, Lingah, Henjam, Debai, Bahrain, Kuwait, but omits Bunder Abbas. He proposes ( 1 ) installations of varying power and radius of action. He understands that the object is to connect the principal markets on the Arabian shore of Gulf with cable on Persian shore, thus providing an economical and satisfactory means of communicating between those places and Indian markets, and at the same time to retain control of communications in hands of Government of India. He considers it unnecessary for this purpose that each station should be able to communicate directly with each other by wireless, but all stations would be able to inter-communicate either by cable or by cable and wireless through those on Persian Coast, (2) 300-mile station at Bushire enabling you to maintain communication with any ships in Gulf and to telegraph directly to any of above stations, (3) Lawrence to be fitted with small installation, (4) adoption of Marconi system throughout.

I entirely agree with him as to the importance and object of the scheme as indicated by him, and I also concur as to the details of four items comprising his recom mendations. It does not, however, seem to me that an installation at Henjam is technically essential to the scheme, but presumably it is required in connection with proposal to establish a coal depot there and consequent need for providing speedy direct communication with His Majesty’s ships. I would recommend, if the scheme is proceeded with, that the existing scale of rates throughout the Gulf be examined and revised. ir fndei Secret1 From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 14t/i June 1910. lour telegram of the 3rd instant.

With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. iSts, ^ated 5 th June 1910 and to the previous correspondence which has passed between the Government of India and myself on the subject of telegraphic communication with Kuwait, I I have the honour to forward a copy of Kuwait No. C.-38. dated 19th June 1910. . . ,, 1 . v,, a communication addressed to me by the Political Agent in the same connection. 2 . I need not trouble Government with a repetition of views and arguments already figuring in the previous correspondence, in favour of the linking up of Kuwait. They do not appear to have lost any force generally during the last 3 years. Meanwhile the Arms Traffic menace has become much more acute;— particularly, at present, the contraband traffic into and out of Kuwait the sup pression or control of which is of just as much importance to the Porte in Turkish Arabia as it is to Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. The position then is that at. the present juncture we have the most obvious and cogent grounds for making wireless telegraphic connection with Kuwait, solely as an item of pur Arms Blockade operations, and I submit that if the project is so proceeded with, as a blockade urgency, the Porte will be unable to oppose to the measure such arguments as at other times they might seek to introduce, to the effect that the connection is neither seriously needed nor likely to pay commercially, or that it is an alteration of the status quo. Heaving regard to the trend of Turkish policy under the new regime it seems clear that the longer we defer action the more difficult will it become, while the specific and excellent opportunity which is offered us at present will lapse with the cessation of our blockade or the achievement of a political under standing with France for the control of the traffic, and will never occur again. I earnestly hope, therefore, that the Government of India will feel able to press the measure upon His Majesty’s Government and urge the advantage of acting at once. Locally it is always the first step which is difficult in these matters, and in the present case, once a wireless station is installed, even ostensibly as a temporary measure, the Kuwait public will come to appreciate the utility and convenience of it while the Basra authorities will get used to it so that any subsequent diffi culty in making the station a permanency would seem to be unlikely. No. C-38 (Confidential), dated Kuwait, the 19th June 1910. From— CAPTAIN W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, I. A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a consideration of the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement, No. 275 , dated the 3 rd February 1907 , regarding the possible extension of the Bushire-Fao Telegraph cable | V to Fao. 2 . All the reasons, political and commercial, which have been advanced already in favour of establishing telegraphic communication with Kuwait, apply with added force at this date, 3 years later, in view of the recent political changes in Turkey and the natural commercial growth of Kuwait. At that time I understand it was found that the initial cost of laying the necessary cable-loop and subsequent annual expenditure on the local station would be quite incom mensurate with the possible advantages.3 . With the great increase in the efficiency and knowledge of wireless tele graphy which has taken place in the last few years I would submit _ that the establishment of a wireless station at Kuwait has become worth consideration. The Indo European Telegraph Department has lately erected and is successfully working a wireless station at Jask, only 650 miles from Kuwait, a distance which makes communication between the two places a comparatively simple matter. No estimate of possible revenue at Kuwait can be made as I have no means of ascertaining the number or value of telegrams which Kuwait residents at present despatch from Fao: it is certain, however, that within a year or two the com mercial community would be freely employing telegrams in their large dealings with India, for the town has a population of 20,000 at the lowest estimate and it may amount to double that figure. 4 . The political reasons, however, are now of far more weight than was the case when the matter was last considered. We have in the first place the increased attention which is being given to Kuwait by the Turkish officials at Basra and also presumably by the new Turkish Government—in this connection it may be mentioned that the Wali of Basra has already gone so far as to sound the Shaikh regarding the construction of a land-line from Basra to Kuwait. In the second place there is the Arms Traffic which is beginning to show signs of using Kuwait as a secondary base to Maskat. In a previous letter (C -3 of the 1 ith January 1910 ) I gave a rough estimate of the probable stock of arms and ammunition in Kuwait and since then I have heard that arms landed here are taken to the north-west as far as Damascus and Aleppo by men who come to buy camels from the Bedouin in the Kuwait hinterland: there is besides the regular smuggling trade into the nearer Turkish provinces and along the coast of Persia between Bushire and Muhammarah. With a wireless station at Kuwait I venture to think the efficiency of the naval patrol in the Persian Gulf would be greatly increased and the import of arms from Maskat to Kuwait considerably lessened, whilst smuggling at the head of the Gulf would become far more difficult. 5 . The initial cost of a wireless station I understand would be much below that of a cable-loop and with the experience gained at Jask a very accurate estimate should be possible. I would, therefore, in view of the necessity for further strengthening our political position in Kuwait beg a re-consideration of the matter on the basis of a wireless installation. G. C. B.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of correspondence on the subject of temporary installations of wireless telegraphy for the purpose of coping more effectively with the arms traffic at Bushire, Bahrein, and Debai. The correspondence, it will be seen, is at present incomplete, and Viscount Morley is not yet convinced of the necessity of providing installations which cannot in any case be in working order before the lapse of a considerable time, when the naval blockade may be nearing its completion or the general position as regards the arms traffic have undergone a change. He would, however, be glad to learn at once if Secretary Sir E. Grey sees any objection to erecting the installations should it be thought expedient to do so. I am further to observe that, though the installations at the places named are intended as temporary only, and might be removed when no longer required for the purposes of the arms traffic, it may hereafter be found advisable, if they are now decided on, to retain them permanently for commercial and general purposes in the Persian Gulf. In that event. Lord Morley would propose to prefer a claim upon the British Government for half the cost, in accordance with the terms of the letter of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty s Treasury to tue Foreign Office, dated the 29th September, 1909. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, copy of telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India on the subject of temporary wireless installations for the purpose of coping with the arms traffic at Bushire, Bahrein, and Debai. It will be seen that an enquiry has been made of the Government of India in connection with the expenditure that this proposal would involve, and, pending receipt of their reply, Viscount Morley would be glad to learn whether the Lords Commissioners would be able to give their assistance, if required, by supplying at once three sets of the apparatus, and, if so, what the cost of the sets would be. He would also be glad to receive any further observations of the Lords Commissioners on the subject. Copy of a letter addressed to the Foreign Office is enclosed. TEMPORARY wireless installations. See your telegram dated the 3rd June. It will in any case be some months before apparatus can be working, and expense is great.

We propose eventual establishment of stations at Funder Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, Koweit, Bahrein, and Debai, which should be able to communicate with each other. Assuming establishment of 600 mile wireless station at Jask suggested in despatch of 21st October, range of 200 miles would ordinarily suffice at six places mentioned, but owing to greater distance between Lingah and Bushire 300 miles ranges at those places desirable. Buildings would cost between 20,000 and 30,000 rupees per station, and furniture about Rs. 1,000. Estimate [? exclusive of] buildings and furniture for six stations approximately Rs. 95,500. Annual recurring charge Rs. 68,400 for six stations. These stations would be fitted for normal working wave length of 600 metres, but capable of transmitting wave length up to 800 metres, and could receive any wave length of 600 metres and over. Naval Commanderdn-Chief considers wave lengths suit naval work excellently. We do not propose to introduce Gulf scheme until present state of our finances shows considerable improvement, and in any case when funds become available, we propose to give precedence to our inland wireless scheme [? except in] favour of Jask, where a temporary installation is now being put up, but we send this outline of our proposals, as you desired to consider India and Persian Gulf scheme as a whole.

No. C.-5, dated Bahrein, the 7th August 1909 (Confidential). From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform yon that Mr. Boever, Bahrein Agent of Messrs. Wonckhans and Company, visited me on the afternoon of the 3rd August and in the course of conversation asked me whether he thought Sheikh Esa would have any objection to his erecting a telephone line between Manama and Muharraq, where the firm has a branch Agency generally superintended by a Persian named Abdulla bin Ahmed. I replied that altghouh Doctor Mylrea of the American Mission had a telephone between his house and his hospital (a distance of some two hundred yards) the new proposal was a very different matter and I thought that Sheikh Esa would most probably object. He then asked if he sent me an application whether I would address the Chief on the subject. I answered in the affirmative knowing that I could always obtain a negative answer from Sheikh Esa. The attitude that would be adopted y 'Government was not enquired into by Mr. Roever and I saw no necessity to bring in that issue. Sheikh Esa may well reply that it would compete unfairly with the ferry men, and the telephone posts would also be a nuisance and that he does not care to give up a long slice of land for this purpose. 2. I asked the Agent of Messrs. Gray Paul (next day) whether they were ever likely to desire a telephone to Muharraq and he replied m the negative. None of the Indian traders would he sufficiently progressive to wish tor a telephone and therefore it could only be to the advantage of the German firm, as this Agency would have no use whatever for it. 3 Erom a financial point of view I am sure that the telephone would be a failure, unless a general exchange was erected and the Hmdus and others allowed to call up their business relations on payment of a fixed tee. Even then I am doubtful as to whether it would be a paying concern as the line would be long and expensive. They might have the idea of placing t junior Agent in Muharraq, hut I do not think this probable. As however, there appears to be no advantage in permitting a spread of influence, I will verbally advise the Chief to reply in the negative should any proposal to this effect he made. 4, When I had replied that I would address the Chief on the subject of the tefephone, if officially desired by him to do so, Mr. Roever remarked that their Company was also anxious to instal a wireless system between here and Bushire, and asked what the Chief would think of that. I replied that I knew Sheikh Esa was adverse to innovations, and added that the question of telegraphic communication between Bahrein and Bushire ■/// 6)4 had been discussed before now but that I had heard nothing about it for some time. I then asked if his Company had sanctioned the expenditure, and if he knew how much it would be. He answered that according to some experiments he had made in South America the cost would be about ten thousand pounds sterling but that the recurring cost would be very little. This shows that if his company had ordered him to approach me on the subject, they had either not made out a competent estimate or they had not informed him of the cost. He said that there was no doubt the Company would sanction the amount required. 5 . The conversation then came to an end and the following day I consult ed Mr. Milborrow of Messrs. Gray Paul as to the commercial prospects of the scheme. 6 On considering the matter I came to the conclusion that although the correspondence was confidential, I ought to inform Mr. Roarer that you had addressed the Government of India on this subject and the question was under consideration. I therefore visited him on the 6 th and gave him this inform ation and I trust that my action will be approved. I then asked whether any negotiations had been made in Bushire. To this he replied in the negative. 7 The nearest estimate I can make for receipts is that about 100 telegrams would he despatched from here weekly during the pearl buying season-3 months, while for the rest of the year about 30 or 40 telegrams would be sent weekly. Of course this is merely guess work and the number of telegrams&gt; would necessarily vary according to the rates fixed. 8 . I can hardly believe that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company anticipated that they would ever be permitted to erect a wireless installation, and I fancy that the enquiry was made with an idea of trying to force our hand. Ihe combined proposals show clearly their forward policy even in face of financial loss. 9 . It is needless to say that telegraphic communication would he warmly welcomed by all the mercantile community.WM In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote N o- and address— V &lt;r 'Jnder-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

In accordance with the telegraphic instructions received under Foreign Department, No. SG-S., dated the 10 th February 1909, I have the honour to submit proposals for the Establishment of the Vice-Consul at Lingah. While observing rigid economy in the proposed estimate I have taken care to leave out nothing needful. 2. The proposals are embodied in— (I) the usual Proposition Statement showing the Establishment required. (II) Statement (A) dealing with annual recurring expenditure. (in) Statement (B) dealing with initial expenditure. 3. With reference to the Proposition Statement, the establishment has been confined to what is absolutely necessary. The pay of the English clerk and of the Munshi has been fixed lower than that of similar incumbents m other offices subordinate to this Besidency, while the pay of the Alenial Establishment has been regulated according to the rate sanctioned for similar establishment of the Bunder Abbas Consulate. No provision has been made for a Cavalry Escort as it does not appear to he essential; but if the Vice-Consul is expected to maintain his position in a manner befitting the representative of the Government of India at Lingah, it is desirable to allow him an escort which may consist of one Duffadar and three sowars, the cost of which will be Bs. 1,764 per annum as follows One Duffadar at Rs. 45 per mensem Three Sowars at Rs. 34 each per mensem Total Rs. 540 1,224 1,764 The total cost of the permanent establishment will then be Bs. 17,817. 4. Referring to statement (A), I find that the only items regarding which some explanation may be desirable are : (а) Travelling allowance. ( б ) Hire of Transport. (c) Bent of the Vice-Consulate. Provision under the first two heads aggregating Bs 1,000 has been made on the assumption that the Vice-Consul will he expected to tour by land to Shihkoo pomand occasionally to Lar and Ghilladar in connection with the work which may arise in those places. With regard to (c) provision for the rent of the Vice-Consulate : Ihere are vvixo legaii y F f tl accommodation of the Vice-Consul and no suitable houses at Lmgan tor me aecommuuai, , h1 mi o r t Prs his establishment permanently, and the question of huildmg “^eXpomrv will Tmvp to he decided at no distant date.

But having regard to fact that project is tentative these conditions though preferable are not essential, and if expense involved thereby is considered prohibitive, I suggest following alternative as being possible and more economical. Firstly, incumbent to be military candidate for Political Department on a salary equivalent to four hundred pounds sterling per annum, with house allowance of fifty pounds sterling per annum. Secondly, in lieu of expenditure estimated in Statement B an equipment grant of one hundred and fifty pounds sterling. Thirdly, for expenses of establishment as per Proposition Statement or a modification is a contract grant of two hundred pounds sterling per annum to be expended under the supervision of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Fourthly, for recurring expenditure estimated on Statement A, contract grant of one hundred pounds sterling per annum on same conditions. Total one hundred and fifiy pounds sterling initial and seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling per annum recurring. The above proposals have been made on the supposition that until it is decided whether appointment will be permanent, the incumbent will be able to indent on the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf when necessary for such needs as camp equipage, presents, etc.is ? » Telegram P., dated and received the 3rd March 1909.

Military (Secret), No. 123. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council.

The opinion was expressed that the apparatus should be sufficiently powerful to enable the stations to Avork over a range of 300 miles, but it was suggested that the Admiralty might be consulted regarding the question of range before tenders were called for. 2. The question has been referred to the Admiralty, who have stated that they concur in the proposed range of 300 miles, but have pointed _ out certain advantages that would * To the Admiralty, dated 7th May 6 1908, with enclosure. ensue if the range could be in- From ditto dated 2nd June 1908. creased to 500 miles, and have also JNote by the JJirector-m-Chief, Indo- European Telegraph Department, dated made a number of suggestions on 17th June 1908. ,i • , -r-) ,i otner points, rapers on the subject are enclosed. 3.

Note by the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated 6 th April 1908. It is believed that there is to be a wireless station at Galle, and the mercantile community in Colombo has represented that one is badly wanted at Minicoy, so that the Cape Comorin station should have sufficient power to work stations at these places. The range of the station that may hereafter be erected at some point on the Persian Gulf requires special consideration, as it would be put up for the purposes of the Admiralty. The Italian Government may put up a station at Guardafui, and the range of the Aden station might be fixed with regard to this possibility. H. A. Kirk. Enclosure No. 2. Admiralty to India Office. M. 4991 (Confidential). Admiralty, Sir, 2nd June 1908. With reference to your letter, M. 4660, of the 7th ultimo, respecting the proposed wireless telegraphy stations in India, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will inform the Secretary of State for India in Council that they concur in the proposed range of 300 miles for these stations. 2. At the same time, their Lordships would point out that a station of this kind would be of limited value from a Naval point of view, as His Majesty’s ships will, in the future, be able to communicate at a distance of 500 miles at the least, and that a shore station to be of full value to His Majesty’s Navy should also have a similar range. 3637. A 23. Their Lordships further consider that the proposed scheme for the Persian Gulf should he borne in mind in connection with the Indian scheme, as it is very desirable that one at least of the^ Indian stations should be able to communicate with a Persian Gulf station if the latter be established. 4. Their Lordships presume that the Indian stations will undertake commercial work, and, in this connection, would point out that in Home waters, in order to fulfil naval requirements, the Admiralty keep their naval ’stations entirely distinct from the commercial organisation of radio-telegraphy. This is rendered necessary in Home waters by the amount of naval radio-telegraphy which is constantly taking place, and the difference between the naval wave-lengths and those used by commercial stations. They are aware that the same conditions do not obtain in Indian waters where the number of His Majesty’s ships is limited, but it would be desirable that the stations should be able to communicate readily with His Majesty’s ships when required in peace, and in war should be able to use a naval wave-length. 5. In their Lordships’ opinion the present Indian scheme should not be regarded as final, but the probable future wide extension of radio telegraphy should be borne in mind. It is desirable, therefore, that the scheme should be capable of expansion, so as to be able to harmonise, in the future, with a larger scheme of radio-telegraphic connection throughout the Empire. 6 . In view of the fact that Admiralty high-power stations are now contemplated, or in course of construction, at Gibraltar, Malta, and Hong Kong, the possibility of India forming a link in the chain should especially be kept in view. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State C. I. Thomas. for India. Annex. Note by the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated 17th June 1908. It will be seen from their letter that the Admiralty are prepared to accept wireless telegraph stations with a range of 300 miles as proposed by the Government of India. It is pointed out, however, that as His Majesty’s ships will be able to communicate over a distance of 500 miles at the least, the shore stations to be of full value to the Navy should have a similar range. The miles referred to are nautical miles. 2. The Government of India in their Despatch of the 12th March last refer, to a spare set of wireless apparatus to be kept in reserve at Bombay for erection hereafter at some suitable point in the Persian Gulf. The Admiralty show that it is very desirable that this Persian Gulf station should be able to communicate with one of the Indian stations. If Jask be taken as the Persian Gulf station, then under the present scheme Bombay would be the nearest Indian station. These stations are some 960 miles apart, and an intermediate station would be wanted. This station might be at Karachi, and provided the range of 500 miles was adopted, Karachi could communicate with Bombay on one side and Jask on the other. 3. The Government of India have proposed to establish a station at Cape Comorin, but it appears to be a matter for further consideration whether a stat ion for strategic purposes is required at this point if astation with a range of 500 miles is installed at Galle. It is known that the provision of a station at Galle has been under consideration. Should the station at Minicoy, which the commercial community have asked for, be erected, it could best communicate with a station at Cape Comorin Avhich need not have a range exceeding 300 miles, and this range would allow Cape Comorin and Galle to communicate also. 4. In paragraph 5 of the Admiralty letter it is stated that it is desirable that the scheme adopted by India should be capable of expansion, as there is a possibility in the future that India may form a link in a scheme of radio-telegraphic connection throughout the Empire. It is hoped that in time the high power station at Hong Kong may be put in communication with a similar station at Singapore, and that wireless communication may be established between Singapore or Penang and Madras. It would appear therefore that according to the Admiralty idea the sites for the wireless stations at Madras, Bombay, and Aden, should be chosen of a size that will allow of these higher power stations being installed on them. The Admiralty are arranging for some shore stations with a range of 1,000 to 1,500 miles, and as the distance from Bombay to Aden is 1,640 miles, wireless communication between these stations is quite possible when the time comes to establish a chain of wireless stations throughout the empire. 5. From enquiries I have made at the Admiralty it would appear that a rough estimate of the cost of a wireless telegraph station, with a range of 500 miles at least would be 6,0000 At the present time a station with this range is being is being erected at Aberdeen which it is estimated will cost about this sum. The power is to be obtained from the town electric supply in this case. The bare cost of apparatus alone is about 1,1000 H. A. Kirk.CinfidenttMl. ] No. 23 of 1908. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. DEPARTMENT OE CO xM MERGE AND INDUSTRY. TELEGRAPHS. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretory of State for India. CalcuttOi the 12th March 1908. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram dated the 18th September 1907, we have the honour to address you on the subject of the apparatus to be employed in the wireless telegraph stations which are to be erected for strategic purposes at certain points on and near the coasts of India. 2 . In paragraph 4 of our despatch No. 24 (Telegraphs), dated the 28th March 1907, while reserving the right to adopt any system of wireless telegraphy at the stations referred to, we stated that the Lodge Muirhead apparatus would probably be employed. This apparatus, as we have already explained, has produced excellent results in this country, and we have no reason to question its ability to fulfil all the requirements of the stations which it is proposed to establish. But it has been suggested to us that any of the principal systems now in existence would prove equally efficient for our purposes, and that it would be conducive to economy, if tenders for the supply of the number of sets of apparatus which are required were invited from the holders of the patent rights of the principal systems now in use in Europe and America, and if these were considered before a final decision was made as to the system to be utilized. This suggestion has our approval, and we would accordingly request that, if there is no objection, steps may be taken to invite tenders from the companies exploiting the various systems, and that the tenders may be transmitted to us for examination. The tenders should be for the sale of the apparatus with or without royalty, but free of all conditions regarding its use. 3 . The Indian Telegraph Department has already erected and fitted a wireless telegraph station on Saugor Island, which it may be necessary to transfer further inland to Calcutta, and we shall, therefore, require nine sets2 of apparatus only, namely, two each at Aden, Bomhay, Madras and Cape Comorin, and a spare set to be held in reserve at Bomhay for erection hereafter at some suitable point in the Persian Gulf. As at present advised, we consider that the apparatus should be sufficiently powerful to enable the stations to •work over a range of 300 miles, hut we should be glad if the Admiralty were consulted regarding the question of range before tenders are called for, as they are doubtless in possession of information which will enable them to pronounce an authoritative opinion in the matter.

Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo en closing correspondence on the subject of the extension of wireless telegraphy in the Persian Gulf. With reference to the ante-penultimate and penultimate paragraphs of the enclosure in Major Cox’s despatch, I am to state that the figures officially furnished to this De partment bear out Mr. Akers’ statement as to the cost of A. the installation at Zanzibar, which is quite successful. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office.From Viceroy, 21st September 1908. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of the 27th August. Wireless telegraphs. Cox strongly advocates this in paragraph 14 of his letter on situation in the'Jl Gulf, No. 1726, dated the 6 th June 1908. We consider that installation on three subsidised vessels would be of great advantage, not only for sup pression of arms traffic, but also for general police work in the Gulf. For the former purpose it would be necessary to establish a shore station at some convenient point, probably Henjam, and for general purposes it will be desirable to have stations at Bahrein and Koweit also. See our Despatch No 115, dated the 18th June 1908. Cost for the three ships would be about Rs. 22,900 initial, and Rs. 245 monthly, recurring. Cost of land station with four masts at Jask or Henjam, where there are telegraph stations, would be about Rs. 35,000 initial, and Rs. 365 monthly, recurring. At Bahrein or Koweit, Rs. 22,000 initial, exclusive of buildings, and Rs. 947 a month, recurring. Admiralty might perhaps meet cost of installation on vessels, charge for shore station (sic) being met by Home and India exchequers in equal shares.[Confidential.] &lt;s&gt; No. 8593, dated Bushire, the 27th December 1908 (received 5th January 1909). From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to revert to my letter No. 1023, dated 29th March 1908, on the subject of the extension of telegraphic communication in the Persian Gulf, with particular reference to the ports of Bahrein and Koweit. 2. In that communication I expressed the view that the extension was extremely desirable alike from the commercial, political, naval and quarantine point of view and in connection withnM suppression of the arms traffic. It is possible, however, that Government may have been deterred from proceeding with the project at the time by the question of cost. In case this may be so, I venture to lay before Government a copy of a communication addressed to me by Mr. Charles Akers of the Colonial Office, now on a mission on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to study the question of Sample Rooms and other points of British Commercial interest in the Persian Gulf. It will be seen that his investigations have brought him to the conclusion, with which I am fully in accord, that trade conditions would be greatly facilitated by the extension of telegraphic communication among the Gulf Ports, and that the need can be best met by the establishment of wireless stations at Bushire, Bahrein, Koweit, Debai, Lingah and Bunder Abbas. Moreover, with practical experience of the installation of the wireless system in East Africa, Mr. Akers estimates the cost of establishing the stations recommended, at figures much below those given me by the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs (vide paragraph 3 of my letter above quoted). 3. I very much hope that the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Akers, and the more favourable aspect in which his estimates place the question of cost, may enable the Government of India to give renewed consideration to the question and to press it upon the lively attention of His Majesty s Government. From— Mr. C. Akers, of the Colonial Office, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

The cost of maintenance was 1,000 rupees monthly after the stations were opened for the public service. The precise figures for cost of the installation can be obtained from the African Depart ment of the Foreign Office.

Against this recurring expenditure would be deducted the receipts obtained from the public ] so rar as I can fudge these receipts should be sufficient to cover the recurring annual expense provided that credit be allowed for tbe value of official messages transmitted from tbe several stations. % n I if- nri\ oocjS Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this telegram, to comm uni cate, t ^ immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

He^-e the problem for ships is more difficul , as there is no telegraph line in this district, and information that arms are expected can o y come bv runner, and mav be received too late. However, it has been an advantage to liave'tho operations of the Afghan arm runners practically limited to a short lengt of coast which it is possible to patrol with even one ship with some chance of intei- cepting a dhow—for example, “ Proserpine’s ” capture off Bungi on the 18t i pn , diuI the damping of ammunition off the same place on the 30th April. 4. The /Afghans were late in commencing operations this season. Their deporta-'i- tion from Muscat in December 1907 and the exclusion of later parties capsized their arrangements. They were further delayed in fixing up satisfactory arrangements with Baluchis on the Mekran Coast to act as their agents. Negotiations opened with Noor Mahomed, Chief of Gabrig, fell through owing to his demanding too high a commission. Einally the Afghans concluded an arrangement with Mir Birkat, Chief' of the Bungo district, and commenced operations. In selecting this district it is highly probable that they were influenced by fear cC the telegraph patrol information, and as Mir Birkat is said to have served the Afghans and himself well, it is likely that the Bungi district will be again selected as the Afghan head-quarters next season, which will probably commence in November. In this case it will be well to concentrate our efforts in that direction so long as Afghans remain there, and neglect the coast east of Task unless more ships are available (see also paragraph 10 ). 5 . The net result of the year is that 22,883 rifles and a quantity of ammunition have entered Baluchistan, of which 16,651 rifles have been consigned to Afghans, and are now presumably on their way to Afghanistan and the border tribes. The efforts of His Majesty’s ships employed for the suppression of the arms traffic have resulted in the capture of 1,500 (? 1,750) rifles by “ Proserpine ” and the dumping overboard of some ammunition, but in addition the activity of the ships has no doubt had a deterrent effect. This result, though an improvement on that obtained in previous years, has necessitated an expenditure of about 2,500 tons of coal, value about 5,300/. The odds in favour of the arms runners are enormous with the class and number of ships available. 6 . The arms landed in Baluchistan, although most inimical to British interests, by no means represent the annual export from Muscat. There is no doubt that large quantities of arms are shipped in native craft to Koweit and places on the Persian Coast—in fact, the trade flourishes all over the Gulf. 7. For the Mekran Coast alone I respectfully submit that at least four ships, preferably of the “ Proserpine” class, would be required to seriously check the traffic so long as present Treaty conditions, at Muscat remain in force. There is a coast-line of 170 miles between Tank and Bns-ash-Shir to be watched. If co-operation with armed patrols on the coast could be arranged a solution of the problem would, I think, be presented, but I fear there would be political objections to this course. 8 . My experience of the three subsidized ships on this service has forced me to the conclusion that they are ill-adapted for it. They are deficient in speed and in white complement, but perhaps their greatest limitation is in having no wireless. The “ Sphinx ” also is of little use at night, as she has no searchlight, and the beat of her paddles advertises her presence to a dhow or people on shore at a considerable distance. A dhow with a fair wind Avill make 8 or 9 knots or more. 9. Should the Brussels Conference fail to result in the closing of Muscat to the importation of arms, and the employment of four ships of a superior class for the suppression of the arms traffic not be entertained, I beg to submit the desirability of fitting the subsidized ships with wireless telegraphy. This would, in spite of their other limitations, materially increase their efficiency for this service, and enable them to more readily co-operate with any of the larger ships of the squadron which you could spare for this service. I understand that the establishment of shore wireless telegraphy stations at certain places in the Gulf is contemplated by the Indian Government, and that the question of fitting the subsidized ships has also received consideration in connection with this scheme, but I would urge that the fitting of the ships be not delayed till the shore stations are ready. One ship at a base, such as Jask, Chahbar, or Muscat, could transmit intelligence by wireless telegraphy to a ship cruising off the coast or waiting in an advantageous position to intercept a dhow upon receiving information by wireless telegraphy that she had left Muscat. Again it has happened that intelligence is received of arms having been landed shortly after a ship has gone out to intercept them, the ship therefore wasted coal on a profitless errand, or missed a chance of capturing arms expected at another place because the later information could not be communicated to her. If the ship remaining at the base goes out to act on the later information she may arrive too late, and in any case communication with the base is cut off, and perhaps valuable information may be received from the telephone patrols during the absence of both ships from the base. Such a case is based on actual experience, and illustrates the necessity of wireless telegraphy in all ships employed in this service.10. If, whilst existing Treaties remain in force, some agreement with the Sultan of Muscat could be made by which arms and dhows captured in his territorial waters were confiscated by the Government instead of being handed back to him the problem would be greatly simplified, as a blockade of Muttra, at any rate during the presence of Afghans in Baluchistan, ought to show good results by the employment of the three subsidized ships only if fitted with wireless telegraphy. The saving in cost of -v coa l an( l maintenance involved in other methods would probably balance any reasonable compensation to the Sultan. In the past there have been, I understand, insuperable objections to such an arrangement, but the result of the Brussels Arms Conference may possibly modify the position. 11. It will be seen from the attached statement that the smuggling of arms by Baluchis into Mekran Coast is not confined to the cool season, but is perennial. However, a ship cannot be spared for this service all the year round owing to other requirements, such as the protection of the pearl and date industries, &amp;c. With the concurrence of the Resident and Government of India only one ship has remained on the coast since end of May, and operations will cease until the autumn after middle of June. I am informed that most of the arms run to the Mekran Coast by Baluchis are stored by the Kalifa until the next Afghan season. The Kalifa lives at Sarhingi, '25 miles north-east of Ilapch. The number of arms which find their way into Afghan hands this way is, however, small compared to the direct importation of the Afghans themselves when they come down to the coast in the cool season. 12. The following information, obtained at Muscat, may be useful next season. Dhows for the coast east of Jask prefer to cross direct by the shortest route, 120 miles ; but if after waiting ready laden for some days a fair wind does not serve they work up the Batineh Coast, generally not further than Sohar, and then strike across from there at first favourable opportunity. The Afghan runners making for the coast north of Ras-al-Kuh work up the Batineh Coast to Khor Jfakan or Dibbah and make across from there, thus obtaining a minimum run in the open. The favourite time for landing appears to be just before or at dawn. I have tried to intercept dhows reported as having left Muscat by a “curve of search,” but the many unknown factors are calculated to defeat this method, notably, actual time of leaving, direction, whether direct or by Batineh Coast, and speed. I think that the intelligence service at Muscat and Muttra might be improved. 13. In conclusion, I should like to record the help and assistance given by Mr. New, and I trust that his services to the Government and His Majesty’s ships may not expose him to the risk of reprisal by Afghans or Baluchis when he next goes out on his inspection of the land-line. I have, «fec. (Signed) SHIRLEY LITCHEIELD, Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. The following additional information was received on my return to Muscat, and is added to the report of the 10 th instant, which could not be posted before :— 1 . One hundred rifles consigned to Mir Birkat were thrown overboard from a bedan in deep water off Kuh Mubbarak on the morning of the 11th June on “ Red breast ” being sighted. The rifles were buoyed, but with insufficient buoy rope for depth of water. “Redbreast” was unaware of dumping at the time. 700 rifles belonging to a Persian were thrown overboard in deep water near the Quoins off Musandan on the 24th May (?) on sighting “ Lapwing ” coming up astern. “ Lapwing ” was then on passage from Jask to Henjam. The news was brought to Muscat by the Sheikh of Kumzar on the 31st May. Thus 800 additional rifles may be added to the credit of His Majesty’s ships, although in neither case was the ship aware of the occurrence at the time, which was in each case subsequently reported by the sufferers. These are instances of the moral effect of the presence of His Majesty’s ships, and indicate that their activity combined with the actual capture of two dhows by “ Proserpine ” (one condemned and burnt on circumstantial evidence of having recently landed arms, and the other captured with arms, condemned, and crew punished) have had the desirable effect of creating a state of panic. 2 . 1 am informed that the Sultan of Muscat is greatly disturbed by the recent capture and loss of arms.

'Sphinx' at Rushire, 10th June 190a Sir, I have the honour to forward for your informa tion 'A Statement of Arne' landed in Baluchistan between 1st April 1907 and Slat May 1908 prepared by Mr New, Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs at Jask, who kindly furnished me with a copy. T take this opportunity of submitting some remarks upon the Arms Traffic based upon this state ment and some proposals f’or facilitating the suppression of the trade. 2.- Mr New as you are aware has devoted ^imself with great zeal to the collection of intelligence and has estab lished a system of patrols , 13 in number, on the land line between Jask and Chahbar and a similar number of telephone stations. These patrols report movements of Afghans or Canavans if in their district or parties of Baluchis waiting atany place on the coast to receive consignments of arms. Thei obtain information of the departure of parties for Muscat to purchase arms and where arms are expected to be landed. They alse report when arms are landed, giving the number of rifles. It is not consider ed desirable for the patrols to have direct communication with H. M. Ships on the coast, they accordingly report by telephone to Jask or Chahbar and the information is given to ships at those places. The Commander-In-Chief - 1 ' 16 H. M. Ships ft Vessels, EAST INDIES.The information thus supplied has been of value In avoiding aimless cruising by locating the place at which arms are expected and the fact that a ship promptly arrives off the place has no doubt had a deterrent effect on the Baluch runners by increasing the risk of their enterprise. This is instanced by the companttively small number of arms consigned to Baluchis since end of November 1P07 when a ship was first stationed on the Mekram Coast to wo T&gt; k in conjunc tion with the telephoned information. Owing to other servl ces a sMp could not be spared before that date and it is of interest to note that no ship was on the Mekran Coast on 5 December 1907 and 23 February 1908, on which dates 665 rifles were landed out of a total of 817 between end of November 1907 and end of May 1908. 3.- The system of telephone information also appears to have been instrumental in driving the Afghan runners to the coast West of Jask and North of Ras-al-Kuh which is a new departure. It will be seen that the majority of their rifles have been landed in this neighbourhood, especially at Bungi. Here the problem for ships is more difficult as there is no telegraph line in this district and information that arms are expected can only come by runner and may be received too late. However it has been an advantage to have the operations of the Afghan Arm runners practically limited to a short length of coast which it is possible to patrol with even one whip with some chance of intercepting a dhow - for example 'Proserpine's' capture off Bungi on 18th April and the dumping of ammunition off the same place on 30th April. 4.-l l poo 1 -V 0 ^ , V- , - s\r j \ v w / I is) 4,'V 4*- The Afghans were late in commencing operations this season.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, In Despatch in the Department Wireless Telegraphy for Stra tegic purposes. M 8062. of Commerce and Industry No. 23, dated 12th March 1908, on the subject of the wireless tele graphy stations which are to be erected for strategic purposes at certain points on and near the coasts of India, Your Excellency’s Govern ment requested that tenders for the supply of the nine sets of apparatus required might be invited from the holders of the patent rights of the principal systems now in use in Europe and America. The opinion was expressed that the apparatus should be sufficiently powerful to enable the stations to work over a range of 300 miles, but it was suggested that the Admiralty might be consulted regarding the question of range before tenders were called for. 2. The question has been referred to the Admiralty, who have stated that they concur in the proposed range of 300 miles, but have pointed out certain advantages that would ensue if the range could be in creased to 500 miles, and have also made a number of suggestions on other points.

Before calling for tenders, I propose to await the remarks of your Government on the points raised by the Admiralty. 4.

Note by the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated 6th April 1908. It is believed that there is to be a wireless station at Galle, and the mercantile community in Colombo has represented that one is badly wanted at Minicoy, so that the Cape Comorin station should have sufficient power to work stations at these places. The range of the station that may hereafter be erected at some point on the Persian Gulf requires special consideration, as it would be put up for the purposes of the Admiralty. The Italian Government may put up a station at Guardafui, and the range of the Aden station might be fixed with regard to this possibility. H. A. Kirk. Enclosure No. 2. Admiralty to India Office. M. 4991 (Confidential). Admiralty, gj r 2nd June 1908. With reference to your letter, M. 4660, of the 7th ultimo, respecting the proposed wireless telegraphy stations in India, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will inform the Secretary of State for India in Council that they concur in the proposed range of 300 miles for these stations. 2. At the same time, their Lordships would point out that a station of this kind would be of limited value from a Naval point of view, as His Majesty’s ships will, in the future, be able to communicate at a distance of 500 miles at the least, and that a shore station to be of full value to His Majesty’s Navy should also have a similar range. 3637. A 23. Their Lordships further consider that the proposed scheme for the Persian Gulf should he borne in mind in connection with the Indian scheme, as it is very desirable that one at least of the Indian stations should be able to communicate with a Persian Gulf station if the latter be established. 4. Their Lordships presume that the Indian stations will undertake commercial work, and, in this connection, would point out that in Home waters, in order to fulfil naval requirements, the Admiralty keep their naval stations entirely distinct from the commercial organisation of radio-telegraphy. This is rendered necessary in Home waters by the amount of naval radio-telegraphy which is constantly taking place, and the difference between the naval wave-lengths and those used by commercial stations. They are aware that the same conditions do not obtain in Indian waters where the number of His Majesty’s ships is limited, but it would be desirable that the stations should be able to communicate readily with His Majesty’s ships when required in peace, and in war should be able to use a naval wave-length. 5. In their Lordships’ opinion the present Indian scheme should not be regarded as final, but the probable future wide extension of radio telegraphy should be borne in mind. It is desirable, therefore, that the scheme should be capable of expansion, so as to be able to harmonise, in the future, with a larger scheme of radio-telegraphic connection throughout the Empire. 6. In view of the fact that Admiralty high-power stations are now contemplated, or in course of construction, at Gibraltar, Malta, and Hong Kong, the possibility of India forming a link in the chain should especially be kept in view. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State C. I. Thomas. for India. Annex. Note by the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated 17th June 1908. It will be seen from their letter that the Admiralty are prepared to accept wireless telegraph stations with a range of 300 miles as proposed by the Government of India. It is pointed out, however, that as His Majesty’s ships will be able to communicate over a distance of 500 miles at the least, the shore stations to be of full value to the Navy should have a similar range. The miles referred to are nautical miles. 2. The Government of India in their Despatch of the 12th March last refer to a spare set of wireless apparatus to be kept in reserve at Bombay for erection hereafter at some suitable point in the Persian Gulf. The Admiralty show that it is very desirable that this Persian Gulf station should be able to communicate with one of the Indian stations. If Jask be taken as the Persian Gulf station, then under the present scheme Bombay would be the nearest Indian station. These stations are some 960 miles apart, and an intermediate station would be wanted. This station might be at Karachi, and provided the range of 500 miles was adopted, Karachi could communicate with Bombay on one side and Jask on the other. 3. The Government of India have proposed to establish a station at Cape Comorin, but it appears to be a matter for further consideration whether a stat ion for strategic purposes is required at this point if astation with a range of 500 miles is installed at Galle. It is known that the provision of a station at Galle has been under consideration. Should the station at Minicoy, which the commercial community have asked for, be erected, it could best communicate with a station at Cape Comorin which need not have a range exceeding 300 miles, and this range would allow Cape Comorin and Galle to communicate also. 4. In paragraph 5 of the Admiralty letter it is stated that it is desirable that the scheme adopted by India should be capable of expansion, as there is a possibility in the future that India may form a link in a scheme of radio-telegraphic connection throughout the Empire. It is hoped that in time the high power station at Hong Kong may be put in communication with a similar station at Singapore, and that wireless communication may be established between Singapore or Penang and Madras. It would appear therefore that according to the Admiralty idea the sites for the wireless stations at Madras, Bombay, and Aden, should be chosen of a size that will allow of these higher power stations being installed on them, ihe Admiralty are arranging for some shore stations with a range of 1,000 to 1,500 miles, and as the distance from Bombay to Aden is 1,640 miles, wireless communication between these stations is quite possible when the time comes to establish a chain of wireless stations throughout the empiie. 5. From enquiries I have made at the Admiralty it would appear that a rough estimate of the cost of a wireless telegraph station, v it i a range of 500 miles at least would be 6,000L At the present time a station with this range is being is being erected at Aberdeen which it is estimated will cost about this sum. The power is to be obtained from the town electric supply in this case. The bare cost of apparatus alone is about 1,100k w[Confidential] No. 1726, dated Bushire, the 6th (received 15th) June 1908. From — Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to state that when Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, His Majesty’s late Minister at Tehran, left his post on short leave in the autumn I wrote to urge him to return, if possible, vid the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, on learning that he would not resume his appointment in Persia, I ventured to express to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the hope that it might be found practicable for Sir Cecil Spring-Rice’s successor to join his post by this route. It would, I feel confident, have been greatly in the public interest, and to the advantage of the work between His Majesty’s Legation and this Residency, had the new Minister been able in my company to examine on the spot various aspects of the political and commercial outlook in the south, recently modified as it has been by the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention, the activity of Germany, and the effect of the national movement in Persia upon the economic condition of the country. In the hope that this meeting might take shape I deferred addressing any special representations to the Government of India on the existing situation, but the travelling season has now passed and I can no longer look forward to the privilege of discussing it in person with His Majesty’s Representative in the first instance ; 1 am therefore constrained to lay the fol lowing independent observations before the Government of India. 2. During the past 18 months the situation has been very considerably affected, as far as our interests in the sphere of my appointment are concerned, by the three forces or events above quoted. I will touch upon their several effects in turn. 3. Our reconciliation with Russia —Monsieur Passek during the four years in which he represented Russian interests in Ears and the Gulf appeared to^ me to work against us in every direction in which useful openings could be gained for so doing, and he apparently evinced the same disposition vvhen transferred to the Russian Legation at Tehran. Of Monsieur Andre Miller who succeeded him I have never had any cause for complaint. During the progress of the negociations leading up to the Convention his attitude was correct and cordial, and since its conclusion our relations have increased in frankness and I have every reason to hope and believe that the Russian Consulate-General at Bushire has ceased working to our prejudice. The same cannot yet be said of their Consulate at Bunder Abbas which Monsieur Ovseenko still fills. Deprived by the conclusion of the Convention and probably by specific instructions from his Legation of any legitimate excuse for direct or overt opposition, he seems unable to divest himself of habits^ and bias of longstanding and continues to be a considerable source of inconvenience to our Consulate and interests, through the instrumentality of several Persian Agents whom he employs on missions of espionage and intrigue. I may men tion two who are chiefly prominent ; firstly, the Sadeed-es-Sultaneh, a drunken but clever little Persian with whom, when Foreign Office Agent at Bushire a few years a^o, the Residency refused to hold communication owing to his undesirable character and his obstructive attitude towards British interests ; secondly, one Abul Kassim, at one time a Munshi in the British Residency but discharged as an undesirable character. Whenever any strings exist which can be pulled to our prejudice these persons and others like them are there to pull them, either y newspaper articles or by the encouragement of Jocal Majlises and Persian “ patriots ” in promoting the new doctrine of “ Persia for the Persians and away with Foreign influence.” Foreign influence so far as tney and the u are concerned is a synonym for British influence, and it is to the efforts of such persons and others of their kidney that the frequent difficulties which we now2 experience in effecting the protection of Bahreinis and subjects of the Trucial Coast are primarily due. 4. It is of interest to note here th?t whereas I have always prohibited the Persian employes of the Residency from joining the numerous mushroom societies which the national movement has generated and from identifying themselves with party politics, the representatives of other Powers appear to place no such res trictions on their men, who in the case of Bunder Abbas seem to be actively encouraged thereto by Monsieur Ovseenko. But it is difficult to formulate definite charges in such matters, which could be fully substantiated if necessity arose, and I can only hops that the evil is a temporary one which in view of our altered relations with Russia will disappear with Monsieur Ovseenko’s departure on leave or elsewhere, or perhaps with the relinquishment altogether of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas for which there is now no serious justifica tion. With the above exception, Russian competition in the Gulf whether com mercial or political may, I think, be regarded for the present as giving us little or no cause for anxiety. 5. The attitude of Germany.— comparatively lately the German Consulate at Bushire may be said to have been merely a post of observation, but since the inception of the Hamburg-Amerika Steamer Service to the Gulf and the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention it can no longer be regarded in that light. In May 1907 Dr Listemann, the incumbent of the German Con sulate, was translated to his Legation for the summer and since his return, after 6 months under the influence of Herr von Richthofen, his bearing has altogether altered. Whereas formerly he used to mix freely with the rest of the Bushire community socially, he is now-a-days seldom seen anywhere and keeps very much to himself. Officially, though outwardly friendly, he shows himself in many little ways more prone to worry than before, and at present the question of Gulf Quarantine seems to be the direction in which, apart from the Abu Musa Case, his energies are chiefly directed. But though it will no doubt assume more of a political aspect as time goes on, the present Angio-German question in the Gulf and Southern Persia is essentially commercial, and it is to that aspect of it that we now need chiefly to direct our energies. In this connection I may mention that Messrs. Wonckhaus’s Agency at Lingah is being worked with great activity under Mr. Brown, who has sometimes two, at other times three German Assistants with him, and they appear to be using Lingah, where owing to the absence of serious competition from our own nationals they can practically do as they like, as a training ground for their newly-arrived Assistants and as the head-quarters of their Gulf operations, as distinct from their Busreh* Baghdad Branch. Moreover, Mr. Brown, except for his own Assistants, being the only European now in Lingah, is identifying himself closely with local politics and endeavouring to constitute himself a power in the place in a way which is likely to prove of considerable inconvenience to us. 6. The effect of the recent national and constitutional movement upon the administrative and economic conditions in Fars and on the Persian Gulf Littoral .—might be written regarding the general results of the past 18 months working of the movement, but Government must be generally familiar with its life-history, from the diaries and reports of their officers in Southern Persia, and I will therefore curtail my remarks as far as practicable. The national development is obviously one which any British Government would be primd facie disposed, on principle, to w r atch with sympathetic interest, and I think it may be presumed that it has been watched by their local represen tatives in that spirit, in its earlier stages at all events. But even in the North where the standard of civilisation is much more advanced and the people are more ripe for regeneration, His Majesty’s Legation must, I think, be beginning to despair at the continued prevalence of administrative chaos and the absence of all effective government. In the south I confess I have seen no result from the national movement and the attempt at constitutional government which has 4been otherwise than subversive of law and order and generally paralysing both to the administration and to commerce. Thus the authority of local Governors has been altogether undermined by it. Provided as they now are with altogether inadequate pay they are obliged to resort to all sorts of devices to obtain funds and there has consequently been no cessation of corrupt methods of Government, the only apparent difference being that the local official now lacks the practical personal authority to govern which he possessed before. Under the old regim6 so long as he paid the revenue assessment regularly and complaints from his province were not too overwhelming, ho questions were asked and he was left to drive his own coach. Under the new conditions, including the existence of a free press and the right of public meeting, whenever a local governor attempts to assert his authority in an effective and deterrent manner some individual with a private grudge or an axe to grind or one of the numerous societies which have sprung up forthwith despatches a telegram to the Parliament or inspires a scurrilous article in the vernacular press, and a day or two later the Governor receives a telegram from Tehran asking for information and report. Our present Persian representative at Bushire, the Derya Begi, who on the whole has proved the most effective and conciliatory Governor we have had, has repeatedly of late expressed his exasperation at the humiliating position to which he has been reduced, and at the impossibility of exercising effective authority under existing condition. The result is that the province of Pars and Persian Baluchistan (and Kermanshah for that matter) are in a state of lawlessness and administrative chaos which has not been equalled for generations, and under present auspices it is difficult to conceive how things can be righted or prevented from going from bad to worse except by foreign intervention in some form. Our commercial interests are most immediately affected in the matter of communications. Bri gandage has been rife on the chief trade routes, Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder- Abbas-Kerman, for two years past. The forwarding of goods has been repeatedly stopped altogether and trade with the interior brought to a standstill. Trade has in fact been paralysed and cases of bankruptcy among the native merchants in trading relations with British firms have been of almost daily occurrence. As regards the Shiraz route some little hope has indeed been inspired by the appointment of the Zil-es-Sultan, but conditions on the Kerman route are still as bad as they can be. 7. There is one other direction in which the changed conditions of Govern ment in Tehran have affected our interests adversely, namely, in their bearing upon the administration of the Customs. When the Tariff of 1903 and the Belgian Administration were first inaugurat ed, the Government of India will remember that for a long time afterwards a good deal of difficulty was experienced by Political Officers owing to the aggressive attitude of some of the inexperienced Belgians with whom they had to deal. As time progressed however a working modus vivendi was gradually arrived at, by concessions made on both sides, and within the sphere of my post at all ^^nt 8 relations with the Belgian r6gim6 had much improved at the epoch at which the introduction of parliamentary Government took place. From the first however the attitude of the popular party was most hostile to Monsieur Naus and his Belgian Staff, and the position of the latter has since been a difficult and pre carious one in consequence. On the one hand while under Monsieur Naus’s regime the local Directors were allowed to engage Baghdadis, Chaldeans and Armenians as clerks or sub- ordinates, and found that they were better served by these than by Persians, they are now under orders to entertain Persians wherever possible. Persians are being employed also in the higher grades, such as the Directorship of Lingah. The type of Persian which the Department gets, especially those sent from the n o r . th » is of the partially or sometimes highly educated newspaper-reading class which has been most influenced by the nationalist propaganda preached therein and most intrinsically hostile to the presence of foreigners in any department of thePersian Government. These men naturally work against their Belgian superiors, and the position of the latter has become so unpalatable that resignations and departures on leave pending retirement have been rife during the past year and include the men who have been most conciliatory in their relations with us. The truth is that under the old regime if they wanted a reasonably quiet time they had to curry favour with the Russians or ourselves ; now they have to conciliate the Majlis and vernacular papers, which lose no opportunity of making things uncomfortable for them. On the other hand, owing to the great financial straits to which the Central Government is reduced, the Customs Directors are constantly being pressed to submit more copies funds to the capital, and in order to increase their receipts and meet such demands, they have had recourse to the strict application of many items of the Reglement which they had before allowed to become a dead letter or had interpreted liberally after learning by experience that they were unsuited to the peculiar conditions of commerce in the harbourless Gulf ports. We now seem to be gradually drifting back to the unpleasant relations of 3 years ago, and at present the British trader has not only to contend with every conciev- able difficulty and risk which the insecurity of the trade routes and the uncontrotll- ed licence of tufangchis can provide, but is being daily harassed at the ports by some harsh decision or the new or revived interpretation of some catchpenny clause in the Reglement. 8. Having in the foregoing paragraphs placed before Government in the lightwhich it presents itself to me the general situation existing within the sphere of my post, I now have the honour with much respect to suggest means which, short of armed intervention for the protection of our interests, seem likely in my judgment to strengthen our hands. I will record them in the same order as the subjects above indicated with which they are connected. (9) The possible withdrawal of the Russian Consulate, Bunder Abbas. —If I remember right His Majesty’s Legation before the conclusion of the Anglo- Russian Agreement did draw the attention of the Russian Legation to Monsieur Ovseenko’s demeanour towards our Consulate and interests, and Sir Cecil Spring- Rice expressed to me incidentally the opinion or the hope that the Czar’s Govern ment could hardly retain him at Bunder Abbas after the conclusion of the negociations. Nevertheless, he still retains his post. I am aware, however, that it would be difficult to formulate specific charges against him which could if neces sary be substantiated by direct proof, but perhaps His Majesty’s Government would consider the feasibility of sounding the Russian Ambassador as to whether his Government intend to maintain their present arrangements at Bunder Abbas, where their interests are now exiguous. 10. Appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah. —Owing in a great measure to the supineness and excessive caution of our own merchants it will be seen that Messrs. Wonckhaus through their energetic employe Mr. Brown have acquired a very firm footing in Lingah. Moreover, they are already I believe doing a good deal of business with the Trucial Coast through their friend Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh ; the latter being agent for the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company whose steamers ply there with more or less regularity. I have done my best to induce Messrs. Gray Paul to improve their representation at Lingah, where they have hitherto entrusted their interests to a useless native Agent, and they now assure me that they will endeavour to make some better arrangement. I do not however expect much from them, and in my view it is important that Government should appoint a British Officer as Vice-Consul at that port who would lay himself out both to work up the trade of the port, and at the same time to counteract the personal influence of Messrs. Wonckhaus’s representative who now has the field to himself. Our present Residency Agent, Khan Saheb Agha Bedr, who is an excellent specimen of his class and the best Native Agent we have had, looks after British subjects and protected persons with much zeal and energy, but he cannot be of much service in regard to trade questions. He only receives a salary of 50 rupees per mensem, and I recommend that he be maintained where he is as Native Assistant to the Consular Officer, who could employ him most usefully to work up influence in the Lar and Bastak districts which are supplied from Lingah and to which theGermans will certainly turn their attention if they have not already. The appoint- ment of a British Officer might be considered tentative for two or three years. Regarding the mother of pearl trade from Lingah, which has proved the making of the German Firm, I am addressing Government separately. w. The policing of the Trade Routes.—W as, it been finally decided by His Majesty s Government that, except the step be forced upon them in order to save the lives of Englishmen in Persia, they will not embark on any scheme for the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman routes, either that advocated by Mr. Grahame or any modification of it ? 12. Revision of Customs Tariff and Regiement of /poy.—-The fundamental condition on which this tariff was accepted was that all other transit dues and imposts should be abolished ; but it is now upwards of -4 years since the tariff was introduced, and yet “ rahdari ” in one form or another and other illegal imposts are persistently levied. It is not only a fact that the Central Government has no practical power to stop them, but they still include the income from various illegal taxes in the official schedule of revenue which they call upon local Governors to collect. The continual representations of this Residency and His Majesty’s Legation have no result, a levy is merely taken off to-day and imposed to-morrow. Then again the heavy duty imposed on certain classes of goods such as tea, coffee, has created a colossal system of organised smuggling throughout the Persian littoral, with which the Persian Government are entirely unable to cope, and which nothing but a reversion to a reasonable all round ad valorem tariff or an organised system of coast guard will stop. This smuggling industry is obviously extremely damaging to the interests of legitimate trade. An hcjnest trader at the ports naturally cannot do business when the wares'in which he deals can be bought for 10 or 15 per cent, less a few miles outside the port if not actually in it. I respectfully ask if it is necessary that we continue indefinitely to allow our traders to be increasingly oppressed at the ports by the harsh application of an inflated tariff only accepted on specific terms, which the Persian Government make no attempt to fulfil and could not if they would. Now that we have settled our differences with Russia, would it not be possible to get them to agree to its abrogation in favour of an all-round 7J or 8 per cent, ad valorem duty, a change which would render smuggling a useless risk and increase the revenue at the same time ? An examination of the arrangement under which His Majesty’s ships t( Sphinx’’ “ Lapwing ” and “ Redbreast ” are subsidised for service in the Persian Gulf. —We have now had nearly 4 years’ experience of the working of this arrangement, and while cordially appreciating the complete co-operation and support which I have received from His Excellency Sir George Warrender and his predecessor Sir Edmund Poe, I realise that the Naval Commander-in-Chief cannot perform impossibilities, and am of opinion that if present conditions are to continue, as it seems likely that they will, the requirements of the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf proper, and the Shatt-el-Arab cannot be adequately met by the three vessels now subsidised. Even at normal times, taking into account their minimum periods of absence for necessary service purposes, such as recommissioning, redocking and fitting, and occasional and very necessary changes of air and scene for the officers and crew r s, it is clearly very hard for three ships to do the work required of them without undue strain J and if the concentration of ships on the Mekran Coast in the winter months in connection with the Arms Traffic is to continue, the needs of the northern part of the Gulf will suffer greatly. At the present time, moreover, owing to the absence of any settled or effective government in Tehran His Majesty’s Lega tion is perforce not in a position, in connection with incidents arising in the Gulf, to obtain satisfaction in Tehran by ordinary diplomatic means, and as His Majesty’s Government for reasons which I well understand have decided to6 refrain for the present from taking any drastic steps for asserting pur position, it follows that, as in the recent case of the ill-treatment of a Bahreini at Lingah, I shall have to depend chiefly for maintaining our interests and goodname in these waters upon what can be effected locally with the means ordinarily available. It is very necessary therefore that I should not be deprived of the fortifying presence of one of His Majesty’s ships, within easy reach, during the cold weather. 14. The extension of cable communication in the Persian Gulf. —The proposal to connect Koweit and Bahrein with Bushire by cable or wireless installation is I venture to hope receiving favourable consideration. It would be a great advantage to connect up Lingah at the same time, or at ^ all events British Bassidu with Henjam, Bassidu being within easy reach of Lingah. It would seem important also that His Majesty’s subsidised ships should be fitted with wireless as soon as possible. 15. Improved representation on the Trucial Coast. —The experience of the last two or three years makes me doubt whether it is safe to leave these backward Sheikhs longer in thecnarge of a Native Agent. I shall shortly address Govern ment a separate communication on the subject. 16. I have now mentioned the several means which in my view would materially promote our interests in this region. While doing so I quite realise that it may not be possible for Government to give lively consideration to them en bloc ; at the same time I opine that the present juncture is one at which our interests and future policy must necessarily be subjected to examination and discussion, and it may, therefore, be convenient that such measures as seem locally important and desirable should be on record before Government for such consider ation as may be possible. A copy of this communication is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Legation,t^Zcj£^C , /a -7 &amp;? If ca&gt;'le communication v/aB established with Koweit and Bahre inline re is little doubt that the ITaval authorities would press later the advantages of providing wireless in stallations at these stations for communication with their vessels. It would therefore be desirable, if any telegraph communication is to be provided at Koweit and Bahrein, that it should be on the wireless system. Koweit lies some 156 miles from Bushire, and Bahrein some 165 miles from the same station. The miles referred to are nautical miles. As far as distances are concerned there would be little difficulty in establishing wireless communication. If a wireless station with a range of 500 miles is established at Task, then it could communicate with Bahrein some 390 miles distant, and Bahrein could work with Koweit, which is some 235 miles distant. This arrangement would save the erection of a station at Bushire. The Government of India have under consideration the provision of some wireless telegraph stations on the coasts of India, and among these stations may be one on the Persian Gulf, until the decision is arrived at regarding this station on the Persian Gulf, where, if decided on, it is to be put up and what range it is to have, it seems to be premature to consider the provision of minor installations, such as at Bahrein and Koweit. It will be noticed that the Government of India in their despatch state that they send Major Cox's report for information, but refrain from making any formal proposalsThe Eight Hobble VISCOUNT MOELEY op BLACKBUEN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 18 th June 1908 , My Loud, * No. 1023, dated the 29th March 1908.

We would add that, in connection with the measures proposed for suppression of the arms traffic along the Persian coast, we have already consulted His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, regarding the installation of wireless telegraphy on board the three subsidised ships, and understand that he is in favour of the proposal./ 3. When His Majesty’s Government are disposed further to consider the question, we shall he glad to submit a detailed scheme for your approval. We have the honour to be, My Lob-d, Tour Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants,[Confidential.] No. 1023 , dated Bushire, the 29 th March (received 6 th April) 1908 . From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E,, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C I.E, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to revert to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 570-E., dated 23rd March 1903, on the subject of tele graphic communication between Bushire and Bahrein. 2. It will, I feel sure, be conceded that the 5 years which have since elapsed have seen a considerable development both of the commercial and political aspects of our position in the Persian Gulf generally. Thus in 1904 Political Agents of the Government of India were appointed to the ports and territories of Koweit and Bahrein, a measure which has brought with it the more frequent need of speedy inter-communication in connection with official business. Then again, questions connected with the Quarantine Service of the Gulf (adminis tered by us for the Persian Government) and affecting the working arrangements in force at the various ports of steamer call, including Bahrein and Koweit, have been greatly in evidence, owing both to the provisions of the last Paris Conven tion and to the increasedly jealous criticism of our regime indulged in by the representatives of Foreign Powers. Difficulties both with Bahrein and Koweit have already arisen from time to time in this connection owing to the inability of the Residency Surgeon as Chief of the Service to get into speedy communi cation with either port, especially Bahrein, to which there is only a fortnightly mail. Next, I would allude to the traffic in smuggled arms from the Arab to the Persian shore which has of late assumed such alarming proportions. It is most desirable that British Officers at all ports which are closely identified with the traffic should be in telegraphic communication with one another and with His Majesty’s Ships. Last, but not least, must be remembered the active competition of Foreign Powers, especially Germany at the present moment, with our seaborne trade, a consideration which makes it of the utmost importance that we should place every possible facility in the hands of our own merchants likely to assist them in the struggle. The power to communicate by telegraph with their principals in India is one patent way in which they can be helped if we may judge from their repeated representations for cable extension. All these considerations, I submit, combine to accentuate the desirability, . not to say the necessity, of linking up both ports telegraphically, and there is no doubt that the measure would be cordially welcomed by the Arab Chiefs concerned. At the time my predecessor placed the matter before the Government of India both the cable and wireless systems were indeed considered, but at that epoch cable extension was held to be too expensive a measure, while the exist ing wireless systems were adjudged insufficiently perfected to warrant adoption in the Persian Gulf. Since then, wireless telegraphy has made great strides and in view of the other developments above indicated, 1 now venture to submit the question for consideration. 3. I recently took an opportunity of consulting the officiating Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, on the subject generally. I gathered from him that the cost of cable extension to Bahrein alone would probably be from 4^ to 5 lakhs initial and 7,000 rupees annual recurring expenditure ; whereas in the case of a wireless installation the initial expenditure for installations at Bahrein and Bushire would be well under one lakh and the monthly recurring expenditure about Rs. 1,000 for each station. Thus it appears that in the course of 25 years the Government of India would have incurred about the same expenditure which ever system were adopted. The Department of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, favours the cable alternative, partly perhaps because they have hitherto had no connection withI f ! ' h 11 and no first-hand experience of wireless, and naturally incline to the system with which they are familiar. The Director considers that as far as Bushire is concerned, presuming always that the installation was adjacent to the present cable offices at Reshire as it naturally would be, the instrument could be worked three times a day for an hour at a time by two of the existing staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment signallers. At Bahrein, on the other hand, he is of opinion that two men would be absolutely necessary, one to be in charge of the instruments and one for signalling duties. I do not quite see myself why the electrician should not also do signalling but in any case the contingency of sickness has to be taken into account. 4. Supposing that Koweit were brought into the system as well as Bahrein, the initial and recurring cost would be the same for that port as for Bahrein; but in this case the Director considers it would probably be necessary to provide an extra signaller at Bushire in order to give Koweit the requisite number of communicating hours as well as Bahrein. 5. A wireless installation would of course be more serviceable for all work connected with His Majesty’s Ships and this to my mind is a most important consideration in favour of that system. Having regard to the distance at which they have to lie off the shore, the ability to communicate by wireless would be of the greatest advantage to them both for purposes of communication of news or sailing plans in rough weather and also for intimating their requirements in the way of coal and provisions when approaching the ports. At the present moment His Majesty’s Ships “ Highflyer” and “ Proserpine” now on arms duty in the Gulf find their wireless installations most useful, and I am strongly of opinion that the three vessels subsidised by the Government of India should likewise be fitted with such if practicable. Trusting that the circumstances will be considered to warrant a ation of the question. reconsider-1908 . SIMLA. foeexgmst depa-RTMEhstt. SECRET. External. No. 115, DATED THE 18TH JUNE 1908.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Hit Majesty 9 1 Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 11th July 1907. Sin, We have the honour to address you on the subject of a proposal to effect cable communication with Koweit. 2. The suggestion was first put forward by the Resident at Bushire in telegram, dated 1st July 1904, regarding the establishment of a Post Office at Koweit, it appeared that the Turkish authorities would be inclined to while negotiations were in progress with the Turkish Government regarding the island of Bubiyan. 3. We understand, however, that the protests which have, from time to time, been addressed to the Porte by His Britannic Majesty’s vide our Secret despatch No. 108 (External), Ambassador against the maintenance of a dated the 2 nd August 1906 . Turkish military post on the island, have not been successful, and it is possible therefore that there is no longer the same need as in 1904 to refrain from putting forward the proposal, which we now recommend to your favourable consideration. 4 . Prom a political point of view the arrangement seems very desirable, in paragraph 3 of his despatch to Sir E. Grey, No. 105, dated 18th Eebruary 1907, has drawn particular attention to the importance of this agreement as affecting future negotiations regarding the debouche of the Baghdad railway. 5. Another strong argument in favour of the proposal is that owing to the outbreak of plague in Bahrein it has become necessary to adopt quarantine measures at Koweit. These have been placed under the supervision of the British Assistant Surgeon with the concurrence of the Sheikh. In view of Dr. Thomson’s report it appears probable that it may be necessary in the near future to establish a regular quarantine station there, in which case telegraphic communication would be essential. Other practical advantages which would ensue from the establishment of telegraphic communication with Koweit are described in Major Knox’s letter No. 30, dated the 15th January 1907, of which a copy is enclosed. To these we may add that, if telegraphic communication existed, we should be in a better position than at present to deal with the large demands made by the British India Steam Navigation Company for the continuance of the fast Vide enclosure No. 1. August 1904, but Lord Curzon’s Govern ment took no action, as from Mr. Brodrick’s regard any such proposal as an infringement of the status quo. Sir N. O’Conor considered it especially advisable to avoid any appearance of such infringement as it would both strengthen our position in Koweit, and would convince the Sheikh of our intention to afford him the reasonable exception could hardly be taken by the Porte. Sir N. O’Conormail service touching at Koweit. The present subsidy for the mail service is Rs. 3 , 00,000 a year and a claim was advanced for an additional sum of one lakh if the service was to be maintained on its present footing. For the present the claim has not been pressed, but it may he revived, and we should like in that event to be able to feel that independently of the mail service we had secured prompt and certain communication with this important point in the Gulf. 6 . We submit herewith a memorandum which has been prepared by the Director, Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, from which it appears that the initial cost of effecting the cable connection would he Rs. 1,84,800 apart from the charges for a residence for the signallers and an office, while the annually recurring expenditure to be provided for would amount to Rs. 7,120. We agree with Major Knox that, if the connection is made, the telegraph station should be located at Ras-ul-Arz with a land-line to the Political Agent’s Office, and this arrangement would involve the additional advantage that we should secure control of Vide correspondence ending with onr Secret the headland OU which a tide _ gauge Will despatch No. 42 (External), dated the 7th March probably be located at the instance of the 1907 ' Admiralty. 7 . In the event of the suggestion meeting with your approval, we would ask that a moiety of the initial and recurring expenditure to he incurred in connection with the proposal may be defrayed by His Majesty’s Government.

Now that the Political Agency at Koweit has been established, it seems ation without delay. I have the honour, therefore, to commit the question to the attention of the Government of India. the clerk in charge of the Cable office at Pao, hut that method is uncertain and risky owing to the closeness with which the movements of messengers to or from Sheikh Mubarak are watched by the Turks. 3. I have the honour to suggest for the consideration of Government:— {a) That Koweit he connected with the Bushire-Pao cable; seemingly a very simple matter, the distance involved being only 50 miles. (&amp;) That the fast mail steamer should call once weekly at Koweit. The British India Company would probably find it most convenient to arrange for the up mail to do this. She leaves Bushire on Thursday evening, would call at Koweit at daybreak Priday, and reach Basrah Friday evening or Saturday morning. 4. Very probably the Government of India has already considered these questions, and in any case I feel sanguine that His Excellency the Viceroy in Council will hold that, having now put our hand to the plough as regards Koweit, it is important that we should make our position there as strong as possible and that without delay. advisable that the question of communications should he taken under consider- 2 .

It is possible, however, that the estimated expense proved to be too serious to warrant the Government of India in undertaking the extension until our position at Koweit bad crystallized somewhat. 3 . It seems to be a practical certainty that Koweit must soon figure as a fully equipped quarantin e station under the Paris Convention, and this contin gency in itself would seem to furnish sufficient grounds for the opinion that the project calls for lively consideration, apart from the other grounds advanced by Major Knox. Accordingly, I venture to redirect attention to the question in case the present juncture may be considered by the Government of India to be a suit able one for putting the project into execution. I have little doubt that Sheikh Mubarak would readily assent and co-operate, but pending instructions from Government I shall not broach the matter with him. No. 30, dated the 15th January 1907. From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to solicit a reference to paragraph 3 (a) of your letter No. 262, dated the 13th August 1904, to the Foreign Secretary, on the subject of the linking up of the Bushire-Fao cable by a loup with Koweit. 2. The want has been especially felt during the past month _ in that troublesome little affair in connection with the Ceylon pearl fisheries. An hour at the telegraph station would have averted all the trouble. Such occa sions are likely to arise frequently in the future, and it is quite unnecessary for me to dilate on the undoubted commercial and political advantages that would accrue to this port, if a telegraph station was established here. Our local trade is increasing very considerably, and I think the enterprise of Koweit traders deserves this encouragement. The length of the loup would be a very short one, I understand only 50 miles. 3 . It is with some reluctance that I introduce private topics into this letter but I think I may be justified in calling to your remembrance two cases of serious illness, in one case of myself and another of my wife. Much anxiety might have been spared and I can conceive it possible that valuable lives might be saved if it were possible to send a speedy call for medical relief from Bushire. # . 4. After the great difficulty I have experienced in finding suitable quarters in tbe town of Koweit, I am of opinion that, for the present, the location of the telegraph station should be the Bas-ul-Arz. Whatever may he the extension of Koweit when Baghdad Railway schemes and East and West route projects are matured, the sentinel of the port will always be the Ras. A small land line could be run into the dispensary and one o the clerks of the Political Agent’s office, who are not overburdened with work, could do all the town and official receiving work, while those who preferred to do so could send their messages out the six miles. It would be no further than Reshire is from Bushire. The problem of the lighthouse and tidal observatory 4347 F.D.would be settled at once and the position is a thoroughly healthy one and far preferable to Koweit town as a residence. 5. It would be the greatest boon to the fast mail steamers who would drop their mail at once at the lighthouse and be off within half an hour and the town would be warned four hours beforehand of a steamer’s approach to the harbour. As regards water-supply, the telegraph station, which would be be no troubles with fanatical neighbours. 6 . The Agency launch would provide a reliable means of communicating with the telegraph station by sea and for the carriage of heavy stores from the town to the telegraph quarters, and the Agency camels could also be utilized for the purpose occasionally.
