P.X.Cox. a/g In obedience to your high orders I left for Koweit .''hen you had come on board Mushraf with the Shaikh and Amir Bin Saud,you asked about me. I was at that moment on board but did not know about you,till after you left. I am much ashamed for having written that letter to Shaikh Jabir as I mentioned in that I had to discuss with you on a certain matter. Believe me,Sir,that I did not do so but for fear.Had I not made this excuse they should have landed me from the steamer as before that I said that I was ill but they did not allow me to come up. I therefore this time excused myself for your honour and I hope you will excuse me for that. I returned to Koweit expecting some favour from my brother Shaikh Jabir but I saw from him every thing dis pleasing. Brother Salim told me that I went to Basrah to complain against them,and therefore I had no rights in Koweit as they had captured the properties by dint of sword. 2 hours after my arrival here Shaikh Jabir sent for my servants. He took away from me two servants named Abdul Aziz bin al Harrias and Abdulla bin Jamid and left with me only one servant,and as soon as my clerk Sulaiman al Adsani will come here from Basrah,they wish to dismiss him also from me. He says that I do not deserve ‘any servant,or clerk. The fact is that the salaries of all of them are paid from my pocket. They are committing many things to me and I have no body except the British Government to help me. 1 recuest that you may not accept that I should be wronged. I do not want any thing but that l may be allowed to stay in Basrah or Zubair. I request you 0 Chief not to leave me in this plight. IMplight. As you are my fathers friend I hope, you will extend your kindness like father to son.Shaikh Jabir will not lose anything by my stay in Basrah or Zubair.Verily I do not lorsake my country and my people but on account of unbearable state of affairs. . \ If you permit^to come to Basrah kindly arrange that I may be protected by the Consul till I leave the place. I have not received as yet the pay for Dhil Qaad, Dhil Haj j and Muharrim. They did not give it to my agent nor have they paid it to me since my arrival here. I have not been allowed to go and pay my respects to Major Hamilton.Shaikh Jabir did not allow me that.I however sent him your letter.of a letter dated the 7th December Igle Shaikh uaeir al Mubarlk al Subah.howeit to C.?.q. A/C, I fear that I am troubling you with these letters and I beg you to excuse me for that since I have no refuge except with the British Government# The Shaikh is dealing with me very strictly so much so that 1 have left going to Bazaar or Coffee houses on account of his rigid supervision. Seeing such treatment of the Shaikh with me my friends have ceased to visit me. I do not go to see any body fear ing difficulty. I have given out that 1 am ill and in bed. Dr.ilylrea the American Doctor came to my house to see me as he is my friend but shaikh Jablr sent a man to be present at the inter view so that he may not write for me letters in English, in the past the Consul used 6 o pay me visit and 1 used to go to see him but now this is not allowed. This is degrading to me and I hope th&lt; High Government would not allow this. He is too severe to me thihking that the Government would not care for me. You know that my late father took protection from the Government for him as well as his sons.He also had registered all the estate that he purchased in the name of all of his children. He informed me before his death that he had asked you for a division of his Fao property so that each heir may have a separate share and no injustice be done. After his death there is no body except toe High Government to protect our rights. I beg you over and over again that you may not leave me in this plight.Had I not known that you will relieve me of the difficulty I should have escaped from Koweit or I should have oommitted suicide in preference to toe present plight.

Captain,-. Copy to P.A.Kuwait. Deputy Chief Politioal Officer( 1 ) OUR REPLY TO THE PLr.IOTIFF^S iJEiMDRAHDUM. Oir defence was that this case is outside the jurisdiction of this Courts and even if so ? it should not be heard owing to the great lapse of time ? but if the Court accept to give it a heaJfcingj 1 submit that it is groundless and should be rejectedo THE CASE BEING OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT „ We stated that the honourable Court should not look into this case and in support of proofs towards this point of view, we have followed the four undermentioned principlesg® lo The case is brought against a Prince who rules a State and this cannot be permitted o t 2 . That the British Government under a Protectorate Treaty with the Prince of Kweit has guaranteed the Princess lands forming the subject of this case 0 3o That in compliance with the terms of this Treaty, the deeds of possession by which KoH. supports his case 9 were registered by the knowledge of the Protecting /uthoritieso 4© That this case although it took the form of litigation as in an ordinary one, yet it must in discussion lead unfailingly to the special conditions of guarantee laid down in the Protectorate Treaty to the contents of the Treaty between the British Government and Iraq® The plaintiff has nothing in his reply to satisfy or convince, but has gone so far as to transfer the discussion into another channel,intentionally ignoring the three mentioned principles in order to get rid of their consequences Which no one can escape, by stating that this is an ordinary case having no relation with these Treaties® Whereas the plaintiff^ reply does not warrant any consider- —aticn, still we submit further points to enlighten the Courtx-le It ie admitted that the dependent is H.H. tiie ruling Prince of Kweit, and in accordance with the International Law governing Rulers of States, H.Ho should enjoy full protection and not be submitted to foreign Courts* In support of this the 'English &amp; Empire Digest' states that it is not permitted for States or Kingdoms and their Rulers or Is Presidents to be brought before the Courts as this/contrary to International Law and its principles, except in the following two specific cases, firstly when the State or its Ruler raise a case to the Courts as plaintiffs, the defendant may then submit his demands, secondly when a person or other is indebted to the State or Ruler and such monies or property are in the possession of a third party, the State or Ruler can bring up a case against the debtor and third partyo This law which is applied to kings is also applied to Heads of Protectorates and Sovereign States (Part I, pages, 48 &amp; 5 - from Chapters 404 &amp; 405 of the aforesaid Volume)• It is of interest to state here a judgment given in the English Courts in this sense in a case resembling this one, when a king was summoned as a defendent in his personal capacityo Property in England, belonging to a foreign sovereign Prince in his public capacity, cannot be seized under process in a suit instituted against him in this country on a cause of action arising here 0 Where a suit had been brought in the Lord Jdayor^s Court against the Queen of Spain upon bonds of the Spanish Government bearing interest payable in London -and moneys, belonging to her as the sovereign of that country, had been attached in the hands of garnishees in London to compel her appearance, the Court of QoBo granted a prohibition&lt;&gt; Although the faction v»as not. In form, brou ght against the Queen as Sovereign ; it appearii^g sufficiently by the proceedings that she was charged with liability in that character c The same law prevails, a fortioni, where the action is avowedly grounded on acts done by deft in the character of sovereign*( 3 ) As regards the judgment cited by the plaintiff, let it be supposed that it was really given, it should not be considered as reliable except on its ov/n merits© Even if such a judgment were given by your honour yesterday, it will not prevent you to reflect today and see that justice is on our side© M As justice has always existed, it is better to adhere to it than to follow the paths of injustice** © 2© • It is admitted by common sense and accepted as a just measure, that certain actions taken by a Government do not come under the jurisdiction of the Courts and these are called in the English Law as 'Acts of State*' and in the Latin Law “Actes de Souzer souvraintc ' 0 The responsibilities of a Government necessitate actions, the importance of v/hich cannot be weighed by a judge© He cannot give judgment as to whether such cases are proper or otherwise, or whether they come under his own jurisdiction according to the ordinary laws in force© As, if Acts of State do come under the jurisdiction of the Courts and are governed by the said laws 5 they would cause loss to the very object for which such Acts were sanctioned and probably stop their effect through being left to the descretion of judges v/ho might follow a different policy and point of view of management of the important affairs of the State and would consequently give judgment in compliance with restricted rules and laws which wore specially decreed to regularize rights between private individuals© Among the principal 'Acts of State** are what the treaties of friendship and protection and transactions relating to the cession and appropriation of territories© The transactions of independent states with each other are governed by.other laws than those which Municipal Courts administer, such Courts have neither the means of deciding what is right, nor the power of enforcing any decision which they may make© Hence, the Courts of this country, whether of law or equity, have no jurisdiction to adjudge upon acts committed bvone sovereign atate towards another in the exercise of its sovereign pow^r, such as the making and performance of treaties, the seisure ot annexation cf land or goods in right of conquest or the declara- -tion of war or of blockade or upon any rights or liabilities supposed to be acquired in consequence of such acts 0 The same rule applies even where one party exercising sovereign powers; itself owes allegiance to a higher power, in whose Courts the attempt is made to control its Acts Halsbury the laws of iiingland Vole XXIII pages 30b-307o ✓ The English Courts had adjudged in a case against the iSast Indian Co*, as representative of the Crown of Great Britain, that whether a contract was drawn up or not or whether the action affects one person or several persons^ it does not come under the powers of ordinary Courts® And therefore, there are no grounds for private individuals to put a claim for same against the Viceroy of India as a representative of the said Co* The circumstances of the action for which this judgment was given may be summed up in the fo llo wings- The Eastern Indian Co. had annexed lands belonging to a certain Indian Kajah, who was still under age, and had fixed for him a regular allowance for life® The Co* designated itself as a tutor of the Hajah, just for a short period, and then finally took possession of his private propertieso Then he died, his heirs Drought an action against the Viceroy who was considered as having replaced the Eastern Indian Co* and claimed the arrears of the allowance and asked for a statement of account of the management of the hajah's private properties® The Court decided that the action taken by the Co® comes under the 'Acts of State * 1 and is not within the powers of the Courts® In a Court presided by Judge Fletcher Molton in the action of Salamon V, the Indian Secretary of State of India, the Court Adjudged that:- 'Acts of state are not all of one kind; their nature and consequences may differ in an infinite variety of ways and these differences may profoundly affect the position of municipal Courtswith regard to thenio For instance, an Act of State may fix the relations between two States each of which continues to possess an independent existence« The consequences of such an Act oi State are entirely beyond the congnisance of municipal Courts because they do not administer treaty obligations between independent States» now. These principles/quoted ? should be respected in the Courts of a Government responsible for these Acts of State as nach as they should be followed in the case vhere the 6 Act of State' was issued by an independent State other than the one to which the court belongs. The English Courts have strictly followed this in many similar cases. In a case in which the English Courts decided that it had no jurisdiction to adjudge an action raised by British Subjects against the seizure of their properties in Iceland effected by certain Danish subjects, which seizure was later confirmed by the / Danish Government the Court decided that it had no power to deal in the action, although it was raised by Britishers against Danish subjects, on the grounds that the decision of the Danish Government in confirming the seizure was one of the 'Acts of State'. (See the aforesaid volume, page 12 Chapters 9 &amp; 65)o’ There is no doubt that a Protectorate Treaty is one of these 'Acts of State', whether it be considered in regard to Great Britain or in regard to HoK. the Prince of Kweit. On the other hand 9 there is no doubt that the guarantee given by the British Government to the Prince in consequence of his appreciable assistance during the War, is admittedly an 'Act of State' and its said character cannot be contested or affected by having been drawn up in the form of an agreementc (See judgment delivered by Judge Fletcher Molton in the case previously mentioned of Salamon V the Secretary of State of India ) 0 Had the British Government put in force this guarantee, the Acting Commander-in-Chief would have ordered the registration of the properties in the name of KoH. the Prince. Such action on his part would be taken as an 'Act of State'. Therefore, the Courts have not the power to adjudge upon its correctness or not, orwhether it is in conformity with the lav/a or otherwise, because Acts of State cannot be weighed except by the State necessities and big aims which backed them up® The Courts should, therefore, as Judge Fletcher Molton decided, respect such Acts and consider them as established facts which eannot be overlookedo EXTRACT FROM THE ENGLISH &amp; EMPIRE DIGEST o (Vol. 38 - pages 4 &amp; 5) * But the object and effect of an Act of State are not necessarily of this kind. Its intention and effisct may_ _be^t£ and create rights, as betv/ s eri U:C..GQV^:nPi^;t. ^ Indlvjda&amp; lS who are or who abou^ ^&gt;0 become subdec-t5-0.f Govto 0 • 0 The true view of an Act of State appeal's to me to be that it is a catastrophic change constituting a new departure• Municipal Law has nothing to do with the Act of Change by which this departure is affected*. Its duty is simply to accept the new departure 5 and its power and its duty to adjudicate upon an enforce, rights of individuals or of the Govt. In the future appear to me to be precisely the same v/hether the origin of such right© be an act of State or not. But although this be so it must not be supposed that the principles of interpretation applicable to an Act of State are the same as those which apply to other Acts* For, instanc e if m ^ct_of State be a document T ;urporting to_c.Qnfer_.b^n,?f.ito. afl bv no mean© necessar ily follows that-there is any intepUQp.ltP- cpeatq a contract, of or that the should,be ^he same, of inter ore tat ion, as Ccise of . a contract, between two LndfYiduals ^—* Q9V\° iZLl&amp;S exercise of its sov ereLm oovver tg rassrve._fcp itself digcretionary powers quite incunsi^t^t.with,.contcaatual relations* As regards the plaintiff's pretentions that the Acting Coizsaander-in-Chief had no authority to order the registration of the deed© of property in the name of K.H. the Prince, these pretention© are unfounded &amp; incorrect as this Officer was coirjnandiig the troops occupying this territory (Basra)o This power was given 1 &gt; hir by Us Protectorate Treaty in question, which was drawn upbetween hie Govemaient .and HoH. The Prince of Kweit. The Officer commanding i.ns. to satcsiy H*Ho at the time cjid prove to him that tne British Government was interested in his affairs and well disposed to put in force its obligations. The registration of the deeds in question and the Protectorate Treaty, -.&lt;±t ough two individual parts, aim at one and the same object and lead to the completion of one by the other, and therefore it is unfounded and unreasonable to say that the Acting Commander- f r.-: /as not authorized by his Government to order the registra tion. , it must -e ac.:-i. 2 t.ted that vhen a Government confirms i ts representative in a post of importance - even with limited powers - any action he may take must be regarded as an M Act of State”. Therefore, the decisions taken by the british Government should be considered as final decisions. rom the foregoing, it is sufficiently proved that the Acting ■' 'or-in-Crief had the right in regard to the registration of o o- property 02 HoH 0 The Prince, considering that this action comes under his power in his capacity as Acting Commander- in-Chief and is considered an M Act of State” emanating at that time from an authorised channel, and must be respected a just decision, the discussion of which cannot be admitted or held as valid. 4. In view of the aforementioned statements, it is important to expose what is really meant by a guarantee or security. ak^ act of SecUi ^ ty is a declaration from the guarantor to guaranteed to take on himself obligations to secure &amp; maintain the rights of the guaranteed or otherwise defray their value. A security therefore combines two steps 5 the first is that the guarantor is held to stand by the guaranteed and defend him until he obtains his very rights, and if he fails, he has to give .u/ ti e value of the security, which is the second step. -w.ing as a i'esu—t ol guaranteed rights would unfailingly lead the guarantor into such disputes ^xnd their consequences. i t. 5 case point, Hoi.o Prince kou'oarak encountered somedifficulties in regard to the registration of his deeds during the Turkis rule and later Great Britain guaranteed him his rights for the ‘possession of these same properties. H.fi. had no doubt whatever as to the importance of this in relation to the said properties and that it would be fUlly secured* So long as the guarantee given by the British Government concerns properties under dispute, the plaintiffs who brought this action against the Prince should certainly have brought it in the first place against the British Government, the Prince y s guarantor, and such guarantee, as already explained, is an H Act of State 1 * which does not concern any Court either in the Iraq or elsewhere. In spite of this, the question may be considered from another point of view* Ihe British Government took this step at the time of the occupation 02 Iraq vhich was administered in accordance Vith / statute of such occupation, hater on, and follov/ing Peace Treaties, the country became under mandate. hen this mandate ceased to exist in accordance with treaties of friendship between Great Britain &amp; Iraq, the latter obtained its independence. Should not the Government of Iraq by these treaties and after having replaced the British Government and became independent, take over on its own responsibility all the engagements and obligations of Great Britain in so far as concerns lands in Iraq? Ve cannot admit or imagine that Great Britain had intended to free the Iraq Government from the obligations she took upon herself towards H.H. The Prince, especially when this guarantee cannot be complete or achieve its ends to the benefit of the Prince unless Hie Government of Iraq is bound by its terms, having replaced the British Government in its obligations towards the Prince. These points have been given in order to enlighten the Court, in regard to the numerous international difficulties, resulting from the present dispute which can never be solved by ordinary Courts•r ( ON ‘iliE QUESTION OF THE The prosecutor replied on this defence that the Prince admitted the action and that their testatrix was absent, and also that this defence could not be heard against a(Khokani) legal Act. Our answer to this is brief. The case is that the plaintiffs pretend ownership pf these properties - the subject of this dispute. H.Ho The Prince strongly denied this and submitted official documents to prove his own ownership of these properties in support of his defence and not in the form of a complaint. It is strange how it has been understood that KoH. The Prince's admittance is taken by them as a confession of their rights in the litigation under dispute. Such a confession should imply a conscientious avowal of the existence of the adversary's right with the intention of freeing him from the onus probandi, and he who tells you that you had a right and lost it, admits nothing, because if he had given you something, he has in the same time deprived you of ito We should not split this admittance, taking into consideration one paft and leaving the other. In our first defence we gave sufficient proof with regard to the considerable lapse of time, during the interval of which it has been proved that RoH« The Prince \ as in full possession of these properties and of the proper documents which confirmed from what date he was the rightful owner® ^'e have pointed out further It is sufficient that 16 years elapsed during which period the plaintiffs made no opposition, and these are sufficient grounds for the judge to reject the case® As regards the plaintiffs' statement concerning the absence of their testatrix, this should not be taken into account, because the absence which prevents the unhearing of a case is one of a definite nature when the whereabouts of the absentee are unknown and then it is not known whether he is dead or alive® If such absence is legally confirmed by a judgment, his will is then opened® But as a matter of fact, the whereabouts of the plaintiffs' testatrix were known and she had an authorised representative whoHsfc.r-uged her estate, and no ?ody whatever had given notice that she was untrace&amp;ble or applied to register her absence legally. Her v ill was not opened until her death in the year 1^30, as proved in the official distribution of her estate. It is a legally established point that our defence regarding the relapse of time cannot be considered void unless the definite absence is proved, and this was not the fact; and further it cannot be considered void unless the testatrix would be under age, which point was not mentioned by the plaintiffs. As for their pretention that the relapse of time cannot be applied to Khakani deeds, no reference to this could be found in the Iraq Laws. As regards the judgments to v/hich the plaintiffs referred, if correct, would have been given in cases different to this action. Our objection to the hearing of this action is on le.al grounds, with the express aim t.o prevent the impression of forgery or false accusations ag&amp;inst him who has been in possession of the properties for a considerable time and' this is clear proof that they belong to him 0 The unhearing of a case, owing to lapse of time, was originally decreed to prevent attempts of forgery of false reclama- -tions against him who has been in possession of the property for a considerable time, which presumes that it belongs to himo Such grounds although correct in most cases may be not in some rare ones The legislator gives no heed to what is rare, and so he presumes, de pure, that the said lapse of time proves that the claimant has no x'ight on the propertyo Therefore, there is no reason or place for arguments against our defence on the great lapse of time, and subciit that the plaintiffs who remained silent&gt; negligent and careless with i-egard to their interests ~ after havir^g been deprived of the possession of the properties ~ now come forward and declare that they have a document to support their claim, trying to evade the presumption which is in the basis of the law relating to the lapse of time* Arguments cannot be admitted because the aim of the law on the lapse of time, as already stated, is not combined and the' islator v/aa aatiefied on the points of the silence during that period as also on the question cf th« possession of the propertieso A ■VCRD IK COKCLUSIOI OF THE CkS£. After all v/hat has been explained and in spite of the incompetence of the Court and the case being prescribed ? it should ba rejected on the grounds that HoKo The Prince holds authentic deeds in complete fonn * deeds emanating from an authorised person bolding a procuration thoroughly proved to be given by the proprietor. In accordance with the rules and laws &amp; all measures in general V'ith regard to sales 8 donations, properties in trust* marriage and diverse* sanctioned by a procuration would have the power of right as if given by proper person concerned. El Kirtas Pasha within the powers of a procuration he had in hand, sold to Hallo Prince ifobarak El Sabah these properties^ the object of this action and by this sale they no longer exist in the name of the original proprietor since the date of its sale which v/as registered in 1915- Since it is admitted that this sale has separated these properties from the properties of the testatrix, there is no reason whatever to listen to the plaintiffs 5 pretentions which should be rejected. It does not assist them in this action if they declared that the sale was in favour of one person and not in that of another of the sons of El Sheikh 1/lobarak El Sabbah, as the property has in any case come out of the ownership of the textatrix and her possessions, and consequently they have no further claim or right thereon whatever. YvHEREFORE We insist on the demands laid down in our first memorandum.Case of heirs of ZUHAIH against the male heirs of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait ♦ CASE NuTE by the Attorney of His Highness * TIWTSLATION . Dated 27th January 1938* From -Abdul-Jail1 iartoo, Lawyer, Basra. To -The Political Agent, Kuwait. Copy is No,1 or aitachaents . Copy of deed or sale Is attachments. Copy is No.3 of attachraents. Excell ncy, I have studied the substance of the case filed on behalf of Abdulla al-Z.uhair against the sons of the late Shaikh Mubarak al-Subah, 'and the following are my observations about it:- The suit was filed to prove the ownership of the heirs of Awwashah al-Zuhair to the Parcels of date gardens serial Nos. 94, 95, 96 and 97, in perpetuity, and to make null and void the Ta:ou 1 documents standing in the names of the sons of the ; late Shaikh Jtubarak al-Subah Nos. 13,14,15,16, 17 and 18 dated Ab (July) 1915, and to restrain the sons of Shaikh Mubarak from preventing the heirs of the said Awwashah from taking possession of the said date gardens, and to order them to remove their hands from the property, and to give posses sion to the plaintiff, as well as to make the defendents bear the costs of the suit. After careful examination of the Tabu documents held by the sons of Shaikh Mubarak, they were found to have been registered in the Tapu department after the sale was effected, and that was by an order issued by the Mufattlsh-ul-Maliyah (Finance De »art mont Inspector) gated i'1th haze.r-n 1915 No.504 ,Copy is No &gt; 4 o f attachments . Extract at attachment ioTEmr Extract in attachment No.5 (h). r elying on a deed roade in the presence of the British Consul at Basra during the Turkish regime. 2. My observations about the origin of the matter are: - All sales of immovable properties must take place between the seller and purchaser at the Tapu Department, and any sale vhi'-h did not take place in this manner is considered as if it did not happen at all. The sale should have taken place between the attorneys of the seller and the pur chaser, and both should have affirmed it at the Tapu department. But as it did not take place in the presence of the Director of the Tapu department, f the sale is not considered effective according to law. There are some points in this case from which it would be possible to draw benifit, the most important of which are: - Firstly, The Passage of Time. A. The Indian Passage of Time Act, para 14 of article 1 of the Indian massage of Time Act implies that no case should be heard for reversing any action or decision mode by a competent Government Official after one year from the date of such actior or decision, as, according to the Indian Passage of Time Act, a right collapses after the passage of the time fixed for raising a claim, and it is a right which can be claimed by any of those for whose benifit it was drawn, without consideration of any reasons, or means, which might arise in the face of the one drawing benifit from it, and that is as clearly set down in article 3 of the Indian Passage of Time Act as against the Ottoman Passage of Time Lav: In which there are soqq points which do not make a right collapse by the passage of tine, butvw Copy is attaohmeni ^oTST ■but tho particulars of the passage of time have 'been set down in the Gazette while depending on have been allowed to become time-barred without making their claims and it has been clearly set dov/n for the proper records of the law Courts. As the Indian Passage of Time A.ot has been brought into effect at Basr-a in the month of At) (July) 1915,| the objection against the decision of the rr ufattish- uKfaliyah, who was the competent official t &gt; make such decisions, should have been raised before Ab 1916. and as the plaintiff did not make his claim within that period his right to claim now has collapsed. It should be known that though -he Indian Passage of Time Law has been drop ed now, yetJ accordingly to the Taw oC the Courts of Justice No.4 dated 26th Ab 1920. by which the Indian Passagel of Time Law has been dropped, any claim which has become time-barred before the date of the passage of this Taw, cannot be revived because of the said dropping of the Indian Passage of Time Act. B. - Passage of Time according to the Gazette. The Law Courts are forbidden from hearing a case, on which a period of 15 years has passed, by article 1660 of the Gazette, and this present claim was not made for all that period i.e. between j the registration of the proxjerty at the Tapu Depart ment in Ab 1915 till the filling of this suit on 20th Tashreen Awwal 1932, thus a period of more than 15 years has passed and therefore the suit cannot be heard as the legal period has long since the passage of time Laws cannot be raised against the non-existence of a right to those whose claims „ iagainst Tapu documents, while the claim of passage of time cannot he proved without the evidence of witnesses, and such evidence cannot he accepted against a document according to article 80 of the Law of Civil suits. But as in this case the claim of possession during the passage of the legal period can he proved hy the Tapu documents and not hy the evidence of witnesses, in my opinion this case should he dismissed on these grounds. Secondly - Article 114 of Al-Dastoor (the Constitution) Al-Iraqi holds that all Laws issued hy the Commander in Chief of the British Forces in Iraq, or hy the Governor or the High Commissioner are considered as lawful and as all laws of the Government, I have found a Taw which is - The Law of Immovable Properties No,32 - issued on 30th Tamooz 1919, Which gives the right to the Nadir-ul-Maliyyah (Finance Inspectorate) or officials authorised hy Nadhir-ul-Maliyyah, to issue permission for the inactment of all kinds of | sales of immovable properties within the occupied areas. The tone of this Law is suoh that from it can he understood that the Nadir-ul-^aliyyah was given such right before the issue of that Taw, and ■ I herewith copy the relative para of that Law to the letter 'No person is allowed to sell immovable properties within the occupied areas or to purchase- 'mortgage, hold as security or to make any engagemerl (of debt against it, whether as a debtor or as a creditor, or to gain any right or interest in it, without a written permission for such a transaction being first obtained, either from Nadhir-ul-Maliy:y h or fro i another official authorized to give such [ ^permissions for such purpose, and any transactions |which do not conform to this will not he register (at the Tapu Department'.By closely following this para we can see that the order which was issued hy the Mufattish-ul-Maliyah, and according to which the properties were registered, was issued hy an official who was competent to issue such orders and authorized hy the Commander in Chief whose authority is upheld hy Law. Therefore no objection can he raised against these transactions v/hich were in conformitj with the Law. The above deals with the origin of the matter and I have found that there are other points in this case which are illegal, and which it is my duty to bring to your notice, the most important of which are the following: - 1. This case has been taken up by the Lawyer Sulaiman al-Shawwaf as guardian of the minor son of Abdulla al-Zuhair, and as a matter of fact Sulairaan al-Shawwaf holds some promisory notes which he designed against Abdulla al-Zuhair for a large amount which is said to be 3,000 or 5,000 4 Dinars, and that he has taken up this case as process to meet these promissory notes. In my opinion it is illegal for a creditor against the properties of a minor to act as guardian for the protection of the same minor, even though he was made a guardian by the father of the minor, as Government has the general right to protect, and a Judge has the right to dismiss a guardian if his interests are conflicting to those of, a mine 2. The Court has decided for the hearing of the case in the absence of H.H. the Buler of Kuwait and such a decision is against the Law from the following points. (a) The Court has relied, in this decision th the case should proceed in the absence of the defendant, on the service made upon nupon me to 'be present on 5th January 1938 though I have Infomed the Court that I have no authority to accept service for oases which may be filed against the Shaikh, and that the service should be made on the defendant or his agent, (b) But if we assume the impossibility that the service was legal then it would have been the duty of the Court to proceed against the Shaikh on 5th January 1938 but it did not do so and postponed the ase for close examination on 12th January 1938 and on that date it was postponed, due to the absence of the i resident, to 15th January 1938, and on that date it was decided that the case should proceed in the absence of the defen- drint, and this clearly against the law, as the amended Article 144 implies that a decision for proceeding with a case in the absence of a defendant should be made agains' [ him if he does not appear on the day fixed for the hearing of the case, and that if no such dec sion was made on the day of the h hearing of the case, and the case is post poned for some reason to another day, anothe: service should be issued against the defen dant. In this case the Court has twice postponed the case without deciding to proceed with the case, during the absence of the defendant, and the third time it proceeded v/ith the case during the absence of the defendant, while he was not summonsed « by any means whatsoever to be present on 15th January 1938. I have been informed that the case was V proceoded with in the absence of the defe dantCont: Note by ir.A . President of the Court informed me verbally .that their decision to proceed was based ' entirely ' on the telegram, which word he repeated emphatically defendant by relying on the telegram received by the Court in which it was stated that my authority was withdrawn, I personally do not believe the correctness of this opinion as - Firstly - The decision of the Court is available in the files of the case in which it was decided to proceed on with the case in the absence of His Highness the Shaikh, by relying on the service which was made by the Court against me, and not by relying on the telegram. Secondly - There are other suits of His Highness the Hhaikh at the Court, six of which were post poned to the same date viz., 5th January 1938, these being suits Nos. 3214, 3215, 3216, 3288,3289, 3290/1937, and it was not mentioned in the telegram whether the withdrawal of ay authority was because of the service which was made upon me in connection with the case of the properties, moreover the telegram was received 8 days before the date of hearing of the case, therefore there is no connection between the case of proceeding against His Highness the Shaikh during his absence and the telegram which was received by the Court. A copy of the telegram had to be sent to the Court so that it knew that ray authority was withdrawn by the Shaikh. Kven thou*;h v/e may assume that the service upon me was legal, on the with drawal of my authority another new service should have been made, and there is nothing in the tele gram which can show that His Highness the Shaikh knew about the day fixed for the case.

The Turkish Government for their part never tried to upset Shaikh Mubarak’s claim* to 'C* and 'H' and were entirely satisfied so long as Mubarak paid them revenue regularly. This Mubarak took care to do up to the coming of tl* English in 1914. In proof of this the present Shaikh bolds end can produce Turkish Hevenu* receipt a for many years of taxation paid, which in themselves constitute pew erf ul proof that the Al flubali were recognized as the rightful owners by the Turks • 4. Tto t the Fao Estates in particular were reoognlv ed by the Turks as forming part of the Al Siibah lands, Is further proved by the fact that, in an Important inheritance case which arose between the members of the Al Subah family in which several distant branches were concerned.■Ml f X *T&gt;at©d Bth Augusts 1314. -3- concerned, the w S«nlyn Depertnent' acting under direct telegra phic orders* of the BAB AL 'AALI (wlultan Abdul Hamid himself) sat on, adjudicated the matter, and gave written decision. This document vfoioh incidentally gave Fao to Mubarak and those members of the Al Subah re aiding in Kuweit was issued officially under date 14th Hajairsn 1330, There are today several hundred of persons owning garden property in Iraq, between Kurna and Fao, ho are holding their gardens by virtue of 'Sanads' (deeds of purchase) only, who like Muoarak never thought it worth while to take out ifcpu Deeds. His i3Bjesty f s Govuarnffiont can easily verify the truth of this. So wine spread was the practice that it became necessary tar His Henry Dobbs when acting Kevenue Comissioner, Basra, to call upon garden cffners not possessing Thpu papers to take such papers out and register their gardens. This was done by Proclaimtion under the authority of the then Army Coufciaikier. Actually only about 50 % persons took the trouble to register, while 50 % including tn© Al Subah did not. The Al Siimh in the case of *D', Fuo, in particular indeed found s, themselves faced with Almost insuperable difficulty and decided to leave weel t* lone until a»joh time as the War ended and they could approach Hie Majesty’s Government far guidance. Chief of these difficulties v«as the fact that their deoendanta had grown to over 200 in number (men, women and children), and it would hove been a most difficult, if not an impossible operation, to have taken out papers in respect of the various and many names existing, let alone attempt to divide and allocate actual shsres in the Batate according to ttaa Sheria tth© Sharia Law rules* 6 * Moreover from earliest tiroes it had been an axiom in the policy of the various Rulers of Kuwait, to theresolves manage, It&gt;r internal politioal reasons, the tfco Estate on behalf of the foaily os a whole find pay out monthly salariee to individual© Instead. This gave thera that control over th© various members and branches of the family which is so necessary in an Mb tern Kingdom, as it enabled Hie Ruler a to keep the family united in the face cl’ pressure and danger from without.

Cony is No.3 of attacEments* Case of heirs of ZUHAIR afiainst the male heirs of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait , ^ CASE NOTE hy the Attorney of His Highness . TRANSLATION * Dated 27th January 1938. From -AMul-Jalil Partoo, Lawyer, Basra. To -The Political Agent, Kuwait. i Excellency, I have studied the substance of the case • filed on behalf of Abdulla al-Zuhair against the sons of the late Shaikh Mubarak al-Subah, and the following are my observations about it:- ' The suit was filed to prove the o vnership of the heirs of Awwashah al-Zuhair to the Parcels of date gardens serial Nos. 94, 95, 96 and 97, in perpetuity, and to make null and void the Tapu documents standing in the names of the sons of the — | late Shaikh Mubarak al-Subah Nos. 13,14,15,16, 17 and 18 dated Ab (July) 1915, and to restrain the sons of Shaikh Mubarak from preventing the heirs of the said Awwashah from taking possession of the said date gardens, and to order them to remove their hands from the property, and to give posses sion to the plaintiff, as well as to make the defendents bear the costs of the suit. After careful examination of the Tabu documents held by the sons of Shaikh TAibarak, they were fouM to have been registered in the Tapu department after the sale was effected, and that was by an order i ssued by the Mufattlsh-ul-Mallyah (Finance Depart- ’ ment In spector) dated i^th fiazeerm 1915 No.504 ,Copy i 5 No&gt;4 or attachments. Extract at attachment No»5 {a, • Extract in attachment No.5 (h). r elying on a deed made in the presence of the British Consul at Basra during the Turkish regime. 2. My observations about the origin of the matter are: - All sales of immovable properties must take place between the seller and purchaser at the Tapu Department, and any sale */hioh did not take place in this manner is considered as if it did not happen at all. The sale should have taken place between the attorneys of the seller and the pur chaser, and both should have affirmed it at the Tapu department. But as it did not take place in the presence of the Director of the Tapu departmentj the sale is not considered effective according to law. There are some points in this case from which it would be possible to draw benifit, the most important of which are: - Firstly, The Passage of Time. A. The Indian Passage of Time Act, para 14 of article 1 of the Indian Passage of Time Act implies that no case should be heard for reversing any action or decision made by a competent Government Official after one year from the date of such actioi or decision, as, according to the Indian Passage of \ I Time Act, a right collapses after the passage of the time fixed for raising a claim, and it is a right which can be claimed by any of those for whosi benifit it was drawn, without consideration of any reasons, or means, which might arise in the face of the one drawing benifit from it, and that is as fclearly set down in article 3 of the Indian Passage (of Time Act as against the Ottoman Passage of Time Lavrin which there are some points which do not make a right collapse by the passage of time, buttout the particulars of the passage of time have toeen set down in the Gazette while depending on the non-existence of a right to those whose claims have toeen allowed to toecome time-toarred without 1 making their claims and it has toeen clearly set down for the proper records of the Law Courts, As the Indian Passage of Time Act has toeen brought into effect at Basra in the month of Ato (July) 1915, the otojection against the decision of the Mufattish- ul-Maliyah, who was the competent official to make such decisions, should have toeen raised before Ato 1 1916. and as the plaintiff did not make his claim within that period his right to claim now has collapsed. It should toe known that though the : Indian Passage of Time Law has toeen drop ed now, yeli accordingly to the Law oC the Courts of Justice ' No.4 dated 26th Ato 1920. toy which the Indian Passage 1 of Time Law has toeen dropped, any claim which has toecome time-barred before the date of the passage of this Law, cannot toe revived because of the said dropping of the Indian Passage of Time Act. B. - Passage of Time according to the Gazette. The Law Courts are forbidden from hearing a case, on which a period of 15 years has passed, toy article 1660 of the Gazette, and this present claim was not made for all that period i.e. between !, - the registration of the property at the Tapu Depart- | ment in Ato 1915 till the filling of this suit on 20th Tashreen Awwal 1932, thus a period of more than 15 years has passed and therefore the suit cannot toe heard as the legal period has long since passed. However certain Law authorities hold that the passage of time Laws cannot be raised againstagainst Tapu documents, while the claim of passage of time cannot he proved without the evidence of witnesses, and such evidence cannot he accepted ! against a document according to article 80 of the Law of Civil suits* But as in this case the claim of possession during the passage of the legal period can he proved hy the Tapu documents and not hy the evidence of witnesses, in my opinion this case should he dismissed on these grounds* Secondly - Article 114 of Al-Dastoor , (the Constitution) Al-Iraqi holds that all Laws issued hy the Commander in Chief of the British Forces in Iraq, or hy the Governor or the High Commissioner are considered as lawful and as all laws of the Government. I have found a Law which is - The Law of Immovable Properties No.32 - issued, on 30th Tamooz 1919. Which gives the right to the Nadir-ul-Maliyyah (Finance Inspectorate) or officials authorised by Nadhir-ul-Maliyyah, to issue permission for the inactment of all kinds of sales of immovable properties within the occupied areas. The tone of this Law is such that from it can he understood (that the Nadir-ul-Ualiyyah was given such right tjefore the issue of that Law, and I herewith copy the relative para of that Law to the letter •No person is allowed to sell immovable | [properties within the occupied areas or to purchase [mortgage, hold as security or to make any engagemef (of debt against it, whether as a debtor or as a |creditor, or to gain any right or interest in it, [without a written permission for such a tr-'nsactior being first obtained, either from Nadhir-ul-Maliyye [h or from another official authorized to give such ^permissions for such purpose, and any transactions [which do not conform to this will not he registered (at the Tapu Department'.By closely following this para we can see that the order which was issued hy the Mufattish-ul-Maliyah and according to which the properties were ! registered, was issued 'by an official who was competent to issue such orders and authorized hy the Commander in Chief whose authority is upheld hy Law. Therefore no objection can he raised against these transactions which were in oonforraitj with the Law. matter and I have found that there are other points in this oase which are illegal, and which it is my duty to bring to your notice, the most important of which are the following: - 1. This case has been taken up by the Lawyer Sulaiman al-Shawwaf as guardian of the minor son , of Abdulla al-2uhair, and as a matter of fact Sulairaan al-Shawwaf holds some promisory notes which he designed against Abdulla al- 2 uhair for a large amount which is said to be 3,000 or 5,000 Linars, and that he has taken up this case as process to meet these promissory notes. In ny opinion it is illegal for a creditor against the properties of a minor to act as guardian for the protection of the same minor, even though he was Government has the general right to protect, and a Judge has the right to dismiss a guardian if 2. The Court has decided for case in the absence of H.H. th and such a decision is against the law from the following points. (a) The Court has relied, in this decision that the oase should proceed in the absence of the defendant, on the service made upon me The above deals with tne origin of the his interests are conflicting made a guardian by the father of the minor, asupon me to *be present on 5th January 1938 though I have informed the Court that I have which may he filed against the Shaikh, and that the service should he made on the defendant or his agent. (b) But if we assume the impossibility that the service was legal then It would have been the duty of the Court to proceed against the Shaikh on 5th January 1938 hut it did not do so and postponed the case for close examination on 12 th January 1938 and on that date it was postponed, due to the absence of the xresident, to 15th January 1938, and on that date it ’was decided that the case should proceed in the absence of the defen- i dant, and this clearly against the law, as the amended Article 144 implies that a decision for proceeding with a case in absence of a defendant should be made him if he does not appear on the day f for the hearing of the case, and that sucn dec sion was made on the day of t. hearing of the case, and the case is p* poned for some reason to another day, service should be issued against the di dant. In this case the Court has twic&lt; postponed the case without deciding to proceed with the case, during the abse: of the defendant, and the third time i proceeded with the case during the abs&gt; of the defendant, while he was not sum by any means whatsoever to be present on 15th January 1938. no authority to accept service for cases I have been informed that the case was proceeded with in the absence of the defendantCont: Note fry P.A . president of the Court informed me verbally that their decision to proceed was based “ entirely ' on the telegram, 7/hich word he repeated emphatically defendant by relying on the telegram received by the Court in which it was stated that ray authority was withdrawn, I personally do not believe the correctness of this opinion as - Firstly - The decision of the Court is available in the files of the case in which it was decided to proceed on with the case in the absence of His Highness the Shaikh, by relying on the service which was made by the Court against me, and not ,by relying on the telegram. Secondly ~ There are other suits of His Highness the Shaikh at the Court, six of which were post poned to the same date viz,, 5th January 1938, these being suits Nos, 3214, 3215, 3216, 3288,3289, 3290 / 1937 , and it was not mentioned in the telegram whether the withdrawal of ay authority was because of the service which was maae upon me in connection with the case of the properties, moreover the telegram was received 8 days before the date of hearing of the case. Therefore there is no connection between the case of proceeding against His Highness the Shaikh during his absence and the telegram which was received by the Court, A copy of the telegram had to be sent to the Court so that it knew that my authority was withdrawn by the Shaikh, Even though we may assume that the service upon me was legal, on the with drawal of ray authority another new service should have been made, and there is nothing in the tele gram which can show that His Highness the Shaikh knew about the day fixed for the case.

The f^erdens, and one in oartioular are now in jeopardy, the descendants of the original owner, from whom Mubarak bought the Kedaghiya garden (that which is mentioned above) maintain that owing to legally ineffective registration, the garden should asain be theirs, and the sale considered null snd void, insnlte of the length of time which the garden has remained in the hands of the Shaikh** family, and thet their ancestor received full payment for the garden. inf 6 # In the back ground, the Iraq Government, like Turkey, perhaps eyes wi ch disapproval the independence of Kuwait.

(a) The names of the above properties were submitted by the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1914 to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, through Colonel Grey, the then Political Agent, Kuwait, and were again communicated (this time in detail) to Lt.-Colonel Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait by special request on 8th November 1934, by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait; The latter nude the condition that the contents should not be divulged to the Iraq Government or person connected therewith (excepting only details connected with the Faddaghiyeh Estate which formed the subject of special negotiations in 1954)« (b) For title, detailed description, number of holdings, and how acquired, see next and subsequent pages.ANNEXURE I (CONTDJ I. AL MUTAAY/A’AH. (a) Situated on the ri^rfc bank of Shatt al Arab (juet below Kut al Zain) opposite Mohammerah. It is in Fao Nahiya. (b) Held under 'Tapu' and registered in Basra Tapu Departuent in the names of various members of Shaikh Mubarak^ family* (c) In 1911 (5th Safar 1331) Sheikh Mubarak persuaded the Turkish Wali of Basra (Mir Liwa Ali Ritha Pasha) to grant him full Tapu deeds, on his subscribing f.T.11,000/- towards the prosecution of tbe Tripoli campaign of 1911-12. Mubarak had long been refused Tapu papers (as in the case of Faddaghiyeh) unless he agreed to register as a Turkish subject. This to the end of his life he refused to do. (d) The property is divided into the following holdings or 'HIZAN' (plural of 'HAUZ') which is the name given to the garden strips which run inland from the river bank as far as the protective 'bund' erected in the rear of the gardens to keep out flood waters coming from the Khor f Abdulla.

This is in process of being recovered from the river and much money has been spent on building protective dykes and ring bunds to make it suitable for growing palms. When this 'Shalha' is fully recovered from the river the Steikh will have the right to buy it on payment of the 'Bad al Mithal' fee (see also para 5 of Explanatory Note t* Map of Faddaghiyeh sent under Col.Dickson^ Confidential D.0.107, dated 24th May 1933, referred to in (d) above). (g) Of the HIZAN mentioned in (e) above, th® following notes are worth noting: Hauzes (i) and (ii) were purchased from Al Mishri by Shaikh Mubarak in Turkish times. Hauzes (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) (viii) were purchased by Shaikh Mubarak from Ahmad Pash al Zuhair, acting on behalf of his wife, the lady f Awasha. The Turks having refused Tapu documents, Shaikh Mubarak on the occupation of Basra by the British in 1914, applied for and was given Tapu Documents inTapu Documents in respect of all the 6 hauzes* It is in respect of 1/3 of these 6 hauzes that Abdulla al Zuhair brought an action against the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1932 and the two daughters of Awasha who also claim l/3 a piece are now having their interests watched by K.B. Mirza Mohamed, lawyer to the A.P.O.C. Co* f Ltd., in Basra. Hauz (ix) was bought from Shafiqa, wife of Ali Pasha al Zuhair (both dead) by Shaikh Mubarak. This lady it was who feared on account of the properties to visit the British Consul in Basra, and make declaration that she had sold her Bashiyeh Garden to Mubarak. Note. It is interesting to note regarding the Turkish refusal to issue Tapu Deeds tiat records exist in the Kuwait Agency to show that although they (Turks) agreed to issue Tapu deeds if Mubarak registered as a Turkish sihject, the whofce trouble and their reason for being awkward was their belief that His Majesty’s Government was behind Mubarak and was financing him to buy his various properties on behalf of the British Government.-6 ANHEXURE I. (CONTDJ III. AL FARHANIYEH oum KUSHalSHIYEH (known under t he name A1 Farhaniyeh). (a) Situated close together among tiie ALDOWASIR properties (FAO NaHIYA) . (b} Neither garden is registered in IAPU, but both are held under Deed of Purelyse 'SANAD'. (c) The property was bought by the Shaikh of Kuwait over 60 years ago, and before any TAPU Department was established in Iraq by the Turks* (d) The right of ownership of the A1 Sub ah was recognized by the Turks, who took Land Taxes regularly from the day the property was purchased. The present Shaikh has in his possession Turkish Land Revenue receipts stretching over a period of many years* (e) Shaildi Mubarak having had so much trouble with the Turks over his Faddaghiyeh and Mutaawaah Estates, when he tried to register them in Tapu, decided to leave well alone, considering that 50 years undisputed possession rendered his title unassailable. (f) There are no HIZAN as both gardens are quite small.-7 Tf ANNEXUHE I (CONTD. ) IV. AL FAQ . (a) Situated on right bank of River, and extends from well above FAO village down to the sea (some 7 miles). (b) Held for over 100 years by Shaikhs of Kuwait under n WAHBIYEH rt Document, ( Deed of Gift ) on behalf of the whole of the A1 Subah family (some 200 souls today). (c) Original property was granted by Shaikh Rashid al Saadun of Muntafik as a reward for aid given in War against Bin Raschid. Much new land has been recovered from the Sea (as the latter receded) and planted with 1 Date trees and added to the original property (d) The whole property has steadily paid taxes and land revenue to the Turks since earliest times, and Turkish receipts exist for some. (e) Property was recognized as belonging tc ^ Shaikhs of Kuwait by Turkish 'Saniya' Department, which in the year 1314 (Turkish) and acting under orders of the Bab al *Aali (Sultan Abdul Hamid) confirmed the former in possession by Mukharajiya document dated ,after a long dippute, with members of the family residing in Basra. (f) There are 53 separate holdings or 'Hizan' (see note (a) under I.Mutaawa f ah) in the Estate, «aoh under a tenant called a 'DEHDAR f divided up into three sections as follows:- (i) Northern section or ' Radda al Shimali y consisting of 23 HIZAN,- 10 - AMETJRE I (CONTDJ V. AL ’UJAIRAWIYEH. (a) Situated on the Eastern side of the 'SHALHA', opposite the palace of 'YUSFAN' (which lies just north of Sibiliyat) in the ^atha of abu Khasib (approx) 30 jaribs in size)* (b) Held under Tapu, and registered in Basra Tapu Department. (c) Belonged to Shaikh Mubarak and was among original five gardens exempted by His Majesty f s Government in 1914. (d) When Mubarak's daughter n Sbarifa n married Shaikh Saud al Mohamed al Subah (son of Mohamed, who was killed by Mubarak when latter seized throne), he (Mubarak) in order to finally settle family blood feud, gave the 'Ujairawiyeh to 'Sharifa' as a marriage gift. (e) Although therefore this particular garden no lor^er is in the hands of the Ruler of Kuwait, it must obviously still be considered as coming under the 5 exempted gardens and so be free from Iraq taxes. NOTE. The above is the 'fifth' and rather mysterious 'exempted' property of the 1914 pledge, and which Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office asked the writer about when he was recently in London. While it was true therefore to say, as the writer did, that there were only 4 exempted properties in the Shaikh of Kuwait's possession today, it was equally true to say that this fifth property also ooraes under the same pledge. It of course- 11 - of course never paid taxes during the British occupation of Iraq. %■r ‘ft'anslation of the Deed be^een Shaikh Mubarak and Abdul Wahab Kirtas relating to the purchase of the property Fadhagiya ffom Ayesha Khanem, D/ 21st Mohurrum 1327 A.H.

Nevertheless as will be seen from Annexure I, it is one of the Gardens which His Majesty’s OoveiaanGnt included in their 1914 Pledge, and it rauat still be considered exempt from Iraq Taxation. 2 /2 - 8 # As r#arrlenfl ’♦C’* have been held for over 60 years, and Garden 'D* for over 100 year© respectively by the flhsUcha of u«*€tit and as Shaikh Mubarak felt very eeoure in hie title and rights over the» did not trouble t«i:e out r Papu Papera dicing the Trukieh regii®* He had eyperlenoed eo rauoh difficulty with various V*alis and Hutaearrifn over Gardens ’’A** and ”B' luad had spent so much in bribes in his efforts to register then under Tapu ttet he thought it better to leave veil alone.

This Mubarak took care to do up to the coming at tl» English in 1914. In proof of this the present Shaikh holds and can produce Turkish Bevenue receipte for tasny years of taxation paid, which in themselves constitute powerful proof that the Al ftubah were recognized as the ri^htAil owners by the Turks. 4.

There are today several hundred of persons owning garden property in Iraq, between Kurna and Fao, who ere holdii^; their gardens by virtue of 'Bemads' (deeds of purchase) only, who like Mubarak xiever thought it worth while to take out Ifcpu Deeds* Hie ISajesty's Oovernraent can easily verify the truth of this. So wide spread was the practice that it became necessary fer His Henry Dobbs when acting Bevenue Comissioner, Basra, to call upon garden owners not possessing Tfcpu papers to take such papers out and register their gardens. This was done by Proclamation under the authority of the then ^rmy Commander* Actually only about 50 % persons too!; the trouble to register, while 50 ^ including tiie Al Bubnh did not. The Al Sdboh in the case of 'P', Fao, in particular indeed found 8 themselves faced with almost insuperable diffioultl and decided to leave weal alone until such time as the nar ended and they could approach His Majesty's Government far guidance. Chief of these difficulties was the fact that their dweendants had grown to over 200 in muifrer (men, women and children), and it would have been a most difficult, if not an impossible operation, to bnve taken out papers in respect of the various and many names existing, let alone attempt to divide and allocate actual steros in the Katate according to tte Bherlatho Shorla rules. 6.

Nevertheless as will be seen from 2/2. As Gardens 'C* have been held for over 60 years, and Garden ”0' for over 100 years respectively by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and as Shaikh Mubarak felt very secure in his title and rights over them did not trouble to take out Tapu Papers during the Trukish regiiae* He had experienced so much difficulty with various Y/alis and Mutasarrifs over Gardens 'A' and ’ f B n and had spent so much in bribes in his efforts to register them under Tapu ttet he thought it better to leave well alone# He was further encouraged to come to this decision by the chaotic condition existing in the Basra Liwa in the years immediately preceding the Great War, when lack of Government control was the order of the day, and Government 'Mamur s n officials scarcely dared proceed down river for fear of being shot by the tribes. 3# The Turkish Government for their part never tried to upset Shaikh Mubarak’s claims to 'C n and n D w and were entirely satisfied so long as Mubarak paid them revenue regularly. This Mubarak took care to do up to the coming of the English in 1914. In proof of this the present Shaikh holds arh can produce Turkish Revenue receipts for many years of taxation paid, which in themselves constitute powerful proof that the Al Subah were recognized as the rightful owners by the Turks . 4. That the Kao Estates in particular were recognized by the Turks as forming part of the Al Subah lands, is further proved by the fact that, in an important inheritance case which arose between the members of the Al Subah family in which several distant branches were concerned-3- *Dated 8th Augustin 1314. concerned, the 'Saniya Department' acting under direct telegraphic orders* of the BAB AL t AALI (Sultan Abdul Hamid himself) sat on, adjudicated the matter, and gave written decision. This document which incidentally gave Fao to Mubarak and those members of die Al Subah residing in Kuwait was issued officially under date 14th Hajairan 1320. 5. There are today several hundred of persons owning garden property in Iraq, between Kurna and Fao, who are holding their gardens by virtue of 'Sanads' (deeds of purchase) only, who like Mubarak never thought it worth while to take out Tapu Deeds. His Majesty's Government can easily verify the truth of this. So wide spread was the practice that it became necessary for His Henry Dobbs when acting Revenue Commissioner, Basra, to call upon garden owners not possessing Tapu papers to take such papers out and register their gardens. This was done by Proclamation under the authority of the then Army Commander. Actually only abibut 50 # persons took the trouble to register, while 50 % including the Al Subah did not. The Al Subah in the case of 'D', Fao, in particular indeed found s, themselves faced with almost insuperable difficultie and decided to leave weel alone until such time as the War ended and they could approach His Majesty's Government for guidance. Chief of these difficulties was the fact that their decendants had grown to over 200 in number (men, women and children), and it would have been a most difficult, if not an impossible operation, to have taken out papers in respect of the various and many names existing, let alone attempt to divide and allocate actual shares in the Estate according to tte Sheriathe Sheria Lav? rules* 6* Moreover from earliest times it had been an axiom in the policy of the various Rulers of Kuwait, to themselves manage, for internal political reasons, the Fao Estate on behalf of the family as a v?hole and pay out monthly salaries to individuals instead. This gave them that control over the various members and branches of the family which is so necessary in an Eastern Kingdom, as it enabled the Rulers to keep the family united in the face of pressure and danger from without. For instance. Bin Sand in his various efforts to acquire control of Kuwait has before now tried to sow dissension among the A1 Subah but has failed, simply becuase the Shaikh controlled the Fao family’s garden shares.Translation of the Statement of Ahmed xiushdi Bey, th^ Egyptian Lawyer of H.H. the Ruler of Kuwait, in reply to the | SXTOT0QQ5tXof the attorney of the plaintiff AMulla Al-Zuhair. I PLEA OUR REPLY TO THE/STX33XEKT OP THE PIATN^IPP 'A ;7e have pleaded that it is outside the jurisdiction of the Court to deni with this case, and if it is not so then it cannot he heard because of the passage of time, and would if its hearing is admitted then it/be wrong and should he rejected from its very foundation. Re; PLEA OF NONE JURISDICTION 0? THE COURT . TTe have said that the Hon'hie Court cannot deal with 9 this case, and in putting this plea we have relfed on four points: - 1. The case has heen filed against an Arait, heading a State, therefore it is illegal. 2. The British Govt.,in a treaty of protection between them and the Shaikh of Kuwait, has guarranteed the property, under dispute in this, to this Ami r. A 3. As a matter of putting the treaty into effect^ the documents,which are held by the Amir, have been registered by the Occupying Authorities. 4. X The discussions in this case, even though it has been filed for a private right, must terminate by the special condition of guarrantee included in the treaty of protection and by a general clause in the Anglo-Iraq. treaty. And-there is nothing in the counter plea of the x plaintiff against the above which can satisfy. But they have purposely avoided the discussion of the above third point y ignoring it ; so as to amr± evade its unavoidable consquen- ces, they have preferred saying that this case is xxsxixaiaDc an ordinarily private one which has no connections with the above treaties. And though this counter plea requires no comment yet we see that it would jrarra clearer, and will enlighten the belief of the court, to add the following;-1 There is no denying the fact that the defendent is the Amir of Kuwait. Therefore, according to the rules of the Common International Laws, he should enjoy immunity from, and none submission to, Foriegn Laws. In support of the same the following is the translation of a quotation from H the English and Empire Digest' :- ' It is illegal to summon Govts, or thier heads before the Courts as it is against the rules and principles of International Law. There are only two exceptions: One is that when a Govt or Its head put in a case before a Court as xhkix Plaintiffs when the defendent must appear to i.p plea. And the other is that when such a Govt or its head have properties under the control of a third party^ a«d it would be legal to summon the third party? TLthin this meaning,included among Kings, are the Heads of Protectorates and Souzerainty. ( ref. Vol. 1 page 48 and P. 5 Paras 404, 405 of the above quoted book) It would be interesting to quote a Pt^ingfof the English Courts in a case, which is similar to this^in which ths process was issued against a King in his private capacity ' Property in England, belonging to a Foreign Sover^* eign prince in his public capacity, cannot be seized under process in a suit instituted against him in this country on a cause of action arising here.' ' Where a suit had been brought in the Lord Mayor’s Court against the Q\ieen of Spain upon bonds of the Spanish Govt, bearing interest payable in London and moneys, belonging to her as the Soveriegn of that Country, had been attached in the hands of Garnishees in London to compel her appearance, the Court of Q.B. granted a prohibition.' Altho ug h th e act ion was n ot , in form, brought against the Queen as Sovereign; it appearing sufficiently by the proceedings that she was charged with liability in that character.' 'The same Law prevails, a fortioni, where the action is avowedly grounded on acts done by deft in the character of Sovereign.'3 L V As to the contention of the opposition about old judgements - and assuming that such judgements have been passed - these cannot be taken as a reason except in the cases in which they were passed. w The passing of a Judgement yesterday cannot prevent one from reverting to Justice in it, Justice is older and the return to Justice is much better than remaining in injustice'. It is reasonable and Just that there should be, among the acts of State jsuch actions which do not submit to the authority of the Courts and these are called in the English Law as 'Acts of State' and in Latin Laws 'Actes de Souverain- ete'. As the administration of a Oovt. requires the taking of some actions which cannot be weighed by the scales of the Judgejand on v/hich he cannot pass Judgement of being right or wrong, or their being in conformity with, or otherv/ise, of the ordinary Laws. To make such acts submit to the Courts is to make them lose their purpose and become delayed by submitting them to the Judgement of one who does not look i into them through the eyes of Politics and the administration of High matters of State^but who passes Judgement on them according to xxisx narrow rules and laws which were made for regulating the interests of individuals among themselves. And among the most special acts of state, and actions arising out of circumstances, are treaties of freindship and protection and the taking of unquestionable actions by the State in the matters of properties whether by none taxation or the giving of possession. ; i We read the following passage in Halsbury’s 'The Laws E of England' : - The actions of States between themselves cannot be -1 governed b}r internal Laws or Courts, such Courts base no power to settle such matters whether right or wrongs and •'I have not the means to enforce such Judgments had they been allowed to pass x them. Therefore the Courts of this State ( Or. Britain ) have no jurisdiction to pass Judgements on actions taken by one State in■ fxxxiuriTii. mimt ..nr. with another such as the drawing of a treaty, and the occupation or annexation of land—4 or the attachment of goods, the declaration of war or blockade and has no power ts. or authority to deal with any undertaking which can be claimed as having been 'fefegxrggHjcfc drawn or undertaken as a result of such acts as described above. This law prevails even though one of the two States concerned is a subject or protectorate to the other Which takes such cases to its own Courts. 640. 'The transactions of independent States with each other are governed by other laws than those which Municipal Courts administer, such Courts have neigther the means of deciding what is right, nor the power of enforcing any decision which they may make. Hence, the Courts of this Country, whether of law or eauity, have no jurisdiction to adjuga adjudge upon acts committed by one Sovereign State towards another in the excercise of its Sovereign power, such as the making of treaties, the seisure or annexation of Land or goods in right of conquest or the declaration of war or of blockade or upon any rights or liabilities supposed to be aquired in consquence of such acts.'

The origin of the case in which the above decision was made arose out of an action taken by the East India Co. under which the company took possession of the properties of a minot* Baja and granted him an allowance for life, the Company acted as guardians of the Raja during his minorityand took possession of his private properties. After the Raja’s death some of his heirs filed a suit against the Governor G-eneral as the successor of the Company &amp;3DEHa£±Bg demanding the 'balance due of the Rajas* allowances and an account of the administration of isxsxgstxtsxx the Rajas* private estates. The Court ruled that whatever action taken 'by the said company was an act of State and the Court has no jurisdiction to deal with it (Judgement of Justice Fletcher MoIton in the case of SALAMAN Ys. Secretary of State for India) and in the course of the judgement the court e*-£d:- ••Acts of State are not all of one kind; their nature and consquences may differ in an infinite variety of ways and these differences may profoundly affect the position of Municipal Courts with regard to them. For instance, an act of State may fix the relations 'between two states each of which continues to possess an independant existance. The consquences of such an act of state are entirely 'beyond the cognisance of Municipal Courts 'because they do not administer treaty obligations 'between independent states. It should not 'be thought that acts of State are 'bound to conform to the above rules of the Courts of the State which undertakes such obligations,and,before which such disputes are put. But these same rules must be observed even though the dispute arose out of an act of State by a State ; / other than that to which the Courts,before whome the dispute xxx is taken, belong.

I believe that what I have quoted above is suffi- ceint to show that the order issued for the registration of the documents of ownership to H.H. the Amir through the \ is the duty of the courts to respect it as an unavoidable fact' which it is unlawful to discuss as being right or wrong. Fourthly. It is of interest to us to clear the meaning of the G-uarrantee. A guarrantee is an under taking, by the guarrantor to the guarranteed for his right itself nf or its value. It is British Government constitutes confirmation Deputy of C-in-C constitutes an act of State eminating from A one who pssessed the right, at that time, to make it,and it hIt is in two courses: The first is that the guarrantor should stand hy the guarranteed and to defend him to win his right itself. If the right is lost then the gn other course is that the guarrantor should indemnify the guarranteed for his lost right 'by payment of its value. A. dispute about a right guarranteed by guarrantor or warranted by a surety must lead on to holding responsible the guarrantor or surety. In this case, K.E. Shaikh Mubarak met some difficulties in registering the documents during the Turkish regime, and the British guarranteed to him the ownership of this property itself, therefore they have become responsible to him for the property itself. As the guarrantee undertaken by Govt, is fixed on the same thing under dispute, it becomes necessary for anyone who disputes the right of the Amir to first direct his dispute towards the British Govt, the Guarrantors, and whose action, we have already shown, constitues an Act of State and which sx no court in Iraq, or elsewhere has jurisdiction over it. And in addition there is another phase to the matter: As the British Govt., which took this action, was the power in occupation,th then,of Iraq., Governing it by the laws of Occupation, and later, after the declaration of peace, govering it by the laws of mandate, and when the mandate terminated it drew treaties of freindship with Iraq, by which Iraq, gained her complete independence: Does not Iraq., then, after succeeding the British Govt., become completely a responsible Govt. ,xjteHk±HgxmsxxxxH±xiiHEx and thus taking over all the responsibilities and undertakings of the British Govt, in connedtion with Iraq. We cannot imagine that England intended &gt; to set Iraq free of the obligations undertaken by her thx to the Amir of Kuwait, especially when such xxn an undertaking cannot be complete and effective,in safeguarding the interests of the Amir, without the cooperation of Iraq, as successor to, or cooperator with, England in the guarrantee given to the Amir. We have quoted these matters to show the court the extent and the large number of xxxxstxtgygoxpltsrx interiiational complications which arise of this dispute and in which by no means can the ordinary courts in Iraq be able to decide.Defence ~by the plea of passage of time .

An acknowledgement of a right is a confession of the existance of such a right and by an intention of the conf^sn-r of putting any proofs in support of his claims. But any one who says that you have had a right and you have lost it / is not making any acknowledgement to you, as, while he has given you something he robbed you of another and you cannot take part of his statement against him and leave the other part. in support of this plea about the lapse of the necessary time and the proof of possession by of the property by His Highness and on which he relies, we have also shown thsxxsxssKxxBfxth® illegality of hearing the case does not necessiate putting this plea or others, and that the lapse of 15 years of possession without being disputed by the plaintiff,while he was in a position to do so, is sufficeint fOTx&amp;hex^H&amp;gK reason for the Judge to refuse hearing his claim to the property. his bequether, this is irrelevant, as an absence which can preven* the hearing of case,by Lav/, is the complete absence by which it becomes unkown whether the person concerned is dead or alive, and which,if proved, makes it necessary Our reply to the above is simple, the case haxx is the It is strange that this xh should be understood as to himself for such a right and relieving his In our firstt plea we have put in sufficeint reasons and presence of real proofs by which he began taking possession that the As to the plaintiff’s contention about the absence of10 to adjudge the person as being dead and his property disposed of.

Prohahly the judgements mentioned hy uixe plaintiff, if true, are passed in cases different from the present one, as, the irrelevancy of hearing a case is a legal defence^ the purpose of which is the prevention of forgery and false claims against those who have been in possession for long and to whose rights of possession such apparent proof is sufficeint. And though this contention is applicable in the majority of cases, it is not so in xxfsw others, thefefore it is not fixed. And therefore the law considers it as a sufficeint reason to assume that neglect to defend a right during the said period, while in a position to do so, xxsxxisxis: turns such silence from a mere doubt to a xHxfxxxx confirmed fact, therfore it became unlawful to dispute a defence of passage of time by putting the plea that that neglectful claimant,who kept I silent and submitted to the taking possession of his rights from him, should have documents proving his rights putting away the suspecions of forgery, from him, which is the purpose of the Law of defence by passage of time, it is unlawful to dispute that as the purpose of instituting this law, as we have mentioned before, is not fixed, and as the law deemed it sufficeint by xxsx the assumption caused by silence while in a position to defend.I it - 11 - ought to 'be rejected ‘because the Amir is in possession of complete documents of ownership given 'b^ an agent who has a real authority from the previous owner, and it is fixed “by laa law that all actions, such as gift, wakf, marriage, divorce etc undertaken hy an authorised agent has the same effect as if it is undertaken iDy the authorizer himself. Al-Cirtas Pasha was an authorized agent for the sale of the property in thxsx dispute and he sold it as such to Amir Mubarak Al-Sabah by ; ' which sale it passed from the possession of his authorizer from the date of that sale which was registered in 1915. ^hen it is agreed that this sale has passed away the ownership of the property froim the said authorizer, then no claim for possession can be heard from her heirs and they should be kept away from such claim which cannot raise the case, and their ttosxBxra allegations, that the sale was made to one or the other the sons and not to the others of/shaikh Mubarak Al-Sabah^ cannot be of any benefit to them, because anyhow such sale removes ownership from their bequethers hands and they have no concern in the property after that.

That the British Government under a Protectorate Treaty with the Prince of Kweit has guaranteed the Princess lands forming the subject of this case 0 3o That in compliance with the terms of this Treaty, the deeds of possession by which HoH« supports his case 9 were registered by the knowledge of the Protecting /.uthoritieso That this case although it took the form of litigation as in an ordinary one, yet it must in discussion lead unfailingly to the special conditions of guarantee laid down in the Protectorate Treaty to the contents of the Treaty between the British Government and Iraq*, The plaintiff has nothing in his reply to satisfy or convince, but has gone so far as to transfer the discussion into another channel,intentionally ignoring the three mentioned principles in order to get rid of their consequences which no,one can escape, by stating that this is an ordinary case having no relation with these Treatieso Whereas the plaintiff^ reply does not warrant any consider- -ation, still we submit further points to enlighten the Court:-1 It is n&amp;riltted that the defendent is H.H. the ruling Prince of Kweit, and in accordance vyith the International Law governing Eulers of States, h.Ho should enjoy full protection and not he submitted to foreign Courts. In support of this the “Snglish &amp; Empire Digest 11 states that it is not permitted for States or Kingdoms and their Rulers or is Presidents to be brought before the Courts as this/contrary to International Law and its principles, except in the following two specific cases, firstly when the State or its Ruler raise a case to the Courts as plaintiffs, the defendant may then submit his demands, secondly when a person or other is indebted to the State or Ruler end such monies or property are in the possession of a third party, the State or Ruler can bring up a case against the debtor and third party* This law *hich is applied to kings is also applied to Heads of Protectorates and Sovereign States (Part I, pages, 48 &amp; 5 - from Chapters 404 &amp; 405 of the aforesaid Volume)• It is of interest to state here a judgment given in the English Courts in this sense in a case resembling this one, when a king was summoned as a defendant in his personal capacity. Property in England, belonging to a foreign sovereign Prince in his public capacity, cannot be seized under process in a suit instituted against him in this country on a cause of action arising here* Where a suit had been brought in the Lord Mayor 3 s Court against the Queen of Spain upon bonds of the Spanish Government bearing interest payable in London and moneys, belonging to her as the sovereign of that country, had been attached in the hands of garnishees in London to compel her appearance, the Court of QoBo granted a prohibition* Although the faction was not, in fora, brought against the Queen as Sovereign : it appearing sufficiently by the proceedings that she was charged with liability in that character. The same law prevails, a fortioni, where the action is avowedly grounded on acts done by deft in the character of sovereign*( 3 ) As regards the judfe'ffient cited by the plaintiff* l«t it be supposed that it was really tfiven, it should not be considered as reliable except on its own meritso Even if such a judgment were given by your honour yesterday, it will not prevent you to reflect today and see that justice is on our side, 'As justice has al\ .c a existed, it is better to adhere to it than to follow the paths of 2&lt;&gt; ' It is admitted by common sense and accepted as a just measure, that certain actions taken by a Government do not come under the jurisdiction of the Courts and these are called in the English haw as 'Acts of State' and in the Latin i.« v '.^cteo ne Hie responsibilities of a Government necessitate actions, the importance of which cannot be weighed by a judge, he cannot give judgment as to whether such cases are proper or otherwise, or whether they come under his own jurisdiction iccoi ii’i, to t^e ordinary laws in force. As, if Acts of State do come under the jurisdiction of the Courts and are governed by the said laws t they would cause loss to the very object for which such Acts wee sanctioned and probably stop their effect through being left to the descretion of judges who might follow a ditrerent policy a.id point of view of management of the important fairs ot the -,ta — and would consequently give judgment in compliance with restricted rules and lav;s which were specially decreed to regularize rights between private individuals. Among the principal 'Acts of State' are what the treaties of friendship and protection and transactions relating to the cession and appropriation of territories. The transactions of independent states with each other administer, such Courts have neither the means oi deciding ■■ Hence, the Courts of this country, whether of law or equity have no jurisdiction to adjudge upon acts committed ’ey injustice*' o are g&lt; governed by other latfs than those which Municipal Courts is rights nor the power of enforcing any decision which theyone sovereign jtate towards another in the exercise of its sovereign power, such as the making and performance of treaties, the seisure of annexation of land or goods in right of conquest or the declara— -tion of war or of blockade or upon any rights or , supposed to be acquired in consequence of such acts© The same rule applies even where one party exercising sovereign powers; itself owes allegiance to a higher power, in whose Courts the atteropt is made to control its Acts Halsbury the laws of Jingland Vole XXIII pages 30b-307o The English Courts had adjudged in a case against the i!&amp;st Indian Co., as representative of the Crown of Great Britain, that whether a contract was drawn up or not or whether the action affects one person or several persons, it does not come under the powers of ordinary Courtso And therefore, there are no grounds for private individuals to put a claim for same against the Viceroy of India as a representative of the said Co. The circumstances of the action for which this judgment was given-may be summed up in the followings- The Eastern Indian Co. had annexed lands belonging to a certain Indian Rajah, who was still under age, and had fixed for him a regular allov/ance for life. The Co. designated itself as a tutor of the Rajah, just for a short period, and then finally took possession of his private propertieso Then he died, his heirs brought an action against the Viceroy who was considered as having- replaced the Eastern Indian Coo and claimed the arrears of the allov/ance and asked for a statement of account of the management of the Rajah's private propertieso The Court decided that the action taken by the Co. comes under the 'Acts of State' and is not within the powers of the Courts. In a Court presided by Judge Fletcher Holton in the action of Salamon V, the Indian Secretary of State of India, the Court Adjudged thats- 'Acts of state are not all of one kind; their nature and consequences may differ in an infinite variety of ways and these % differences may profoundly affect the position of municipal Courtswith regard 'to them 0 For instance, an Act of State may fix the relations between two States each of which continues to possess an independant existence«, The consequences of such an Act of State are entirely beyond the congnisance of municipal Courts because they do not administer treaty obligations between independent States,, now These principles/quoted ? should be respected in the Courts of a Government responsible for these Acts of State as ouch as they should be followed in the case vhere the $Act of State' was issued by an independent State other than the one to which the court belongs. The English Courts have strictly followed this in many similar cases. In a case in which the English Courts decided that it had no jurisdiction to adjudge an action raised by British Subjects against the seizure of their properties in Iceland effected by certain Danish subjects, ?/hich seizure was later confirmed by the Danish Government 3 the Court decided that it had no power to deal in the action, although it was raised by Britishers against Danish subjects, on the grounds that the decision of the Danish Government in confirming the seizure was one of the 'Acts of State'. (See the aforesaid volume, page 12 Chapters 9 &amp; 65)o There'is no doubt that a Protectorate Treaty is one of these 'Acts of State', whether it be considered in regard to Great Britain or in regard to HoH. the Prince of Kweit. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the guarantee given by the British Government to the Prince in consequence of his appreciable assistance during the War, is admittedly an 'Act of State' and its said character cannot be contested or affected by having been drawn up in the form of an agreemento (See judgment delivered by Judge Fletcher Molton in the case previously mentioned of Salamon V the Secretary of State of India) 0 Had the British Government put in force this guarantee, the Acting Commander-in-Chief would have ordered the registration of the properties in the name of HoH. the Prince. Such action on his part would be taken as an 'Act of State'. Therefore, the Courts have not the power to adjudge upon its correctness or not, orwhether it ie in conformity with the laws or otherwise, because Acts of State cannot be weighed except by the State necessities and big aims which backed them up. The Court ' should, therefore, as Judge Fletcher Holton decided, respect such Acts and consider them as established facts which eannot be overlooked. SXTHACT FmOH THE ENGLISH &amp; EHPIHS DIGEST.

H.B. had no doubt whatever as to the importance of this in relation to the said properties and that it would be fully secured a So long as the guarantee given by the British Government concerns properties under dispute, the plaintiffs who brought this action against the Prince should certainly have brought it in the first place against the British Government, the Prince's guarantor, and such guarantee, as already explained, is an M Act of State 1 * which does not concern any Court aithel* in the Iraq or elsewhere. In spite of this, the question may be considered from another point of view. ihe British Government took this step at the time of the occupation of Iraq which was administered in accordance with statute of such occupation, hater on, and follov/ing Peace Treaties* the country became under mandate• hen this mandate ceased to exist in accordance with treaties of friendship between Great Britain &amp; Iraq, the latter obtained its independence.

The Prince, especially when this guarantee cannot be complete or achieve its ends to the benefit of the Prince unless the Government of Iraq is bound by its terms, having replaced the British Government in its obligations tpv;ards the Prince.

It is sufficient that 16 years elapsed during which period the plaintiffs made no opposition, and these are sufficient grounds for the judge to reject the caseo As regards the plaintiffs' statement concerning the absence of their testatrix, this should not be taken into account, because the absence which prevents the unhearing of a case is one of a definite nature when the whereabouts of the absentee are unknown and then it is not known whether he is dead or alive® If such absence is legally confirmed by a judgment, his will is then opened® But as a matter of fact, the vhereabouts of the plaintiffs' testatrix were known and she had an authorised representative whovU: was not opened until her death in the year 1930, as proved ln t ' e of-icial distribution of her estate. absence is proved, and this was not the fact; and Anther it cannot A- or their pretention that the relapse of time cannot be ,to Khakani deeds, no reference to this could be found in re'erred, if correct, would have been given in cases different to .n fo ger;- or V..se accusations against him who has been in possession of the pro. proof that thqr belong to him.

To, The President, Court of Instance, Basra. Case No. 373/932. The following is my reply to the last plea of the Defendants * lawyer. PLAINTT?F. Abdulla Al-Zuhair, by successorship to the estate of his bequether Awwashah Al-Zuhair. DEPENDENTS. Hamad and Abdulla son^of Shaikh Nubarak Al-Subah ' A and others. Whatever has been put forward by the defendents * lawyer in his last plea does not go out of the scope of his preceding one^all of which are rejectable on the following grounds: - &gt; 1. The case is a private one consisting of a dispute, about a property, between the plaintiff and the defendents ard it must submit to the common laws,dealt with by these courts, without any deferentiation between an Amir or others, because the Lav/s, according to which decisions are made, does not make any exceptions to the rule, while this Hon’ble Court has ft] in fact decided, in the past, a case between Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir and Rafi’ah Al-Rihair, being case No.77/930, regarding a property! in dispute at the same place XX? Al-Faddagiyyah. The said decision of instance was sra# subsquently confirmed by a Court of appeal Judgement No. 66/932 in which no credence was given to the defence of the defendent liich consisted of the sane points which he is putting forward now, viz. tk&amp;y that he has purchased the property from Al-Zuhair etc. And he was,then, ordered to give possession of the property.As to tiie defendents * contention of their having releid on the guarrantee of Great Britain, this is refutable on several grounds among v/hioh are the following: - (1) The guarrantee referred to, if it he true, is in connection with the properties of Shaikh Mubarak, and in the letter put forward by the defendents, which is alleged to have been sent to them by the British Consul, dated 3.11.914 addresses Shaikh Mubarak with these words 'Your gardens', and no doubt, these words refer to the gardens owned by Shaikh Mubarak only. As to the other letter put forward by them, under the signature of the British Consul at Kuwait, dated 20.3.33, i.e. after the date of instituting this case, this has no value at all. ' T hile the property in dispute was never, at any time, been the property of Shaikh Mubarak, and,in fact, it was registered at the Tapu directly in the names of his sons, during his life time and after the date of the said guarrantee. (2) The British guarrantee does not include individuals and cannot be made the means of taking possession of other’s properties. ( 3) If the British Government have guarranteed any proper ty for the Shaikh then he can claim it from them, as the liability of a guarrantee falls on the guarrantor and not on the claimants, and because Great Britain was not an attorney for Awwashah Al-3uhair, the real owner of the property. (4) As the matter stood,and to refute the allegations of the defendents, I am prepared to exclude Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir from the case and to direct it, at the present time, against the other defendents only, as it is set out in the plaint. (5) The Anglo-Iraq treaty has no bearings,at all, on the dispute, as also the Iraq Govt, are in no way responsible for any guarrantees, alleged to have been undertaken by the British Govt., to any other foreign Government, especially as the guarrantee of Great Britain, if it be true, is alleged to have been undertaken before they have any authority over Iraq , and nil that has been mentioned in the Anglo-Iraq treaty is that it has no bearings on the guarrantees undertaken by both parties, according to the League of Nations Pac t and the fact Outlawing3 outlawing ^ ^ X Tax ( Kellog Pact ) and this means, according to the said two pacts, that guarrantees imply responsibility on the guarrantor, among the signatories ( of the two pacts) and not that a gmyrsnt guarrantor should hold another responsible for it. And all that can be said about the matter is that the Anglo-Iraq treaty does undertaken by both parties in the said two pacts. Does the defence means to say that the said British undertaking comes within the said two pacts and that the Iraq. Govt, is, therefore, responsible for it ? If they say so, then, in their allegation, they are n.eigither relying on words nor on Law, as,both the league of Nations Pact and the Pact Outlawing Tar were drawn many years after, 1914, the year in which the British guarrantee is alleged to have been undertaken. (6) The British Govt, abe silent and upto the present they did not make any complaint, in this connection, before the League of Nations. Then on what ssn* grounds are these contentions, on which the defendents rely, are founded ? (7) There are no any references, in the registration of the property in the names of the sfafcja* sons of the late Shaikh Mubarak, to any treaties, protections or guarrantees of those alleged by the defendents. Therefore, their attorneys* allegation that it has been made in accordance with that cannot be accepted. As to the Judgements of Foreign Courts, cited hyxiE the plea under reference, these has no value and no place in our courts. Therefore, all the contentions put forward by the defendents’ attorney, in this connection, cannot be accepted as a reason for the prevention of the hearing of tmis simple and ordi- nary case. 2, The second part of the plea under reference is in connection with the passage of time. Though I have clearly, and sufficeintly,replied in my last statement to all the contentions of the defendents about the passage of time, yet, I again reply. not thwart the liabilities to what they have mentioned in this connection, in their second plea, and therefore I beg to say as follows: - The attorney of the defendents has concentrated his discussions on two points, stout the passage of tine, the fir-the first is that, he says, that the defendent's contention that i.e. from the hequether of the plaintiff through whose successor- ship to the property this case has 'been made, does not amount to a confession. This allegation is unacceptable as the defendents contention contains a clear confession about the ownership of Awwa-hah al-Zuhair and, therefore, there is no use in discussing tjx the plea of passage of time. Because, according to article 1674 of the Law, a confession cuts short the plea of passage of time, if there is any, and a right does not crumple by passage of time. Al-Zuhair at Istanbul during all that time does not break down the plea of passage of time and gave as his reasons that an absence which breaks the plea of passage of time is that absence which is complete and by which it becomes unknown whether the person concerned is dead or alive. These reasons are rejectable, because of the clearness of articles 1463 and 1464 of the law which defines the absence which can break the plea of passage of time as /YV being an absece which takes the person away, on a journey, a dist ance of three days, i.e, 18 hours normal progress, and 'when we know that Awwashah Al-Zuhair was at Istanbul and that the distance between it and Basra, in which the property claimed is situated, exceeds months and not days, by normal progress, then the contention of the attorney of the defendents, in this connection becomes unacceptable from its foundations. repeats the confession about the ownership, by Awwashah Al-Zuhair, of the property claimed. Therefore he is liable for his said confession. attorney of the defendents is irrevalent from all points, I therefore pray for its rejection and repeat my demand for the issue of an order for the demands made in the plaint together with lawyers* fees for the preparation of this plea amounting to I.L&gt;, 1 1.250 and for preparation of the plaint and the previous plea ff each I.D. 11.250 and for all other expences of the case. he had purchased the property from Awwashah Al-Zuhair or her agent, R J * The second point is his plea that the absence of Awwashah The attorney of the defendents, at the end of his plea T he result. in view of the above reasons the plea of the h Guardian, copy off a pleaDear Mr.Bhasin, I am enclosing herewith a copy of the reply from the ^dvocate of the Plaintiff, for your perusal.
