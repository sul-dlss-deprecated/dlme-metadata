I then went to see the wireless station which was under Captain Ahmed*s charge. He had been supplied with comprehensive orders by Captain Keen, when he was at Bandar Abbas, instructing him how to proceed, and it was clear from his remarks that he was suffering from a light excess of zeal* He complained bitterly of the dishonesty and incapacity of the local Persian officials and appeared very anxious to set the administration right, but I advised him to proceed slowly and stick to the duties outlined for him which were to control the wireless station and supply us with what information he could secure. He is, however, a very promising young man, with quite a respectable knowledge of Persian, and I have every hope that under Mr* Rogers' direction he will prove entirely satisfactory. He controls the wireless station by the simple process of locking the door of the place and taking the key away with him and did not consider it was possible to immobilise the machinery during his absence, but was quite certain that his method was fully effective. The actual work of transmission is supervised by him personally. He has, however, made certain other arrangements to keep himself informed of the Telegraph Master's actions* I then visited the lighthouse and inspected its mechanism and am quite convinced that my original diagnosis of its irregularity was correct, namely that it had not been signalling to Axis submarines but that the personnel had been misappropriating the fuel for the lamp.Ext. 454/19^.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs now inform us orally that they regard this as amounting to the creation of a new Consulate and before granting it they wish to be assured that they would be allowed if they wished to open a new Consulate in any British controlled territory. 2, Before recognising revived Consular Agency at Lingeh they wish to have similar assurance. 3. Treaty position appears to be that the United Kingdom and India enjoy most-favoured-nation rights as regards consular ^presentation in Persia, and vice versa (Treaty of 1857, Article 9, reaffirmed in exchange of notes attached to Tariff * Autonomy Treaty of 1928). Persia also has the right, denied to most countries, of maintaining a consular officer at New Delhi.. Question now arises as to what assurance if any regarding the opening of Consulates or Consular Agencies in places in United Kingdom and India not covered by their existing rights can be given to Persian Government. 4. The case of Bandar Abbas could no doubt be covered by an assurance that in any place where Persia already has a Vice Consulate we shall not object to the raising of its status to Consulate. I have assumed that it is your intention that Bandar Abbas should be a Consulate and not a Vice Consulate in which the incumbent has the personal rank of Consul. If this assumption is incorrect the problem disappears so far as Bandar Abbas is concerned. 5. Question of Lingeh is more difficult and if His Majesty*s Government and Government of India are opposed to giving any assurance I can only suggest that Persian Government should be told that they must be content with their existing most-favoured-nation rights and pressed ,to agree to proposed — — - j appointment/' 2 . % appointment for anration of the .or on tho gronna that. conditions necessitate it* ; Government of India letter i P v for creation of a STcSsSisrs sjts , «= ssj*^ ratrs&amp;r!^ ^tan administration of Mekran* 7 T should be grateful for instructions.i i ■SffiSHET 41143. any case the communication of the contents of uhia document to any person outside Government Service is authorised, it must he paraphrased)* Allotted to External Department* CYPHEK TELEGRAM From Government of India, External Affairs Department, To Secretory of State for India* Rptdoto Tehran and Bus hire-, Dated New Delhi, 14*45 hours, 2nd November, 1943* Received 15*15 hours, 2nd November, 1943* 9390, Addressed Secretary of State for India repeated to Minister at Tehran No*330 and British Consul General Bushire* ^ e * iran SavIngram No* 186 of October 1st* 2* It is emphasised that purpose is merely to re-establish same state of affairs at Bandar Abbas as existed in pasi* 5* Revival of Consular Agency at Lingah is matter of extreme urgency for specific war purpose* Persian Government’s obstructive attitude does not (?befj.t) an ally and we trust demand can be presented for immediate compliance*ll ^ ( 3 ) 1 SfiXTr*.

Council ft Previous Papers. FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY. Draft letter to Foreign Office, ^* 6 ^. £&gt; d tD. n^j hap 1S43MINUTE. In December last the Naval and Security Authorities, Middle East, drew attention to the danger of leaving the wireless stations at Lingah and Jask (on the southern shore of Persia) under the sole control of the Persian Government (Minister of State*s telegram No ,636 of December 29th). It was explained that some evidence existed that Japanese submarines had been reconnoitring the waters round the mouth of the Gulf, and that there was in consequence a | &gt; possibility that these wireless stations were being used by enemy * agents (Minister of Stateb telegram No,33 of January 3 th; see also paragraph 1 of Minbranch telegram No. 19 of February 5 th). 2, In the ensuing correspondence the Foreign Office, the Minister of State, H.M, Minister, Tehran, the Persia and Iraq Command and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf were all agreed that these stations should not remain any longer uncontrolled. There was, however, some difference of opinion as to the action to be taken. The Political Resident has consistently recommended that some British authority should take over the control of the two stations, so as to enable legitimate civilian traffic to continue. In his telegram No. 6 ll of February 6 th he reinforced this recommendation by pointing out that wireless v/ould be needed both for the coast watching scheme which the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, had asked him to institute and for the anti-locust campaign. The local Naval and Military Authorities, on the other hand, have been inclined to emphasise the great difficulties inherent both in this solution and . . in that of leaving the stations to be worked by the Persian Authorities f &amp;u£/yk censorship. They have accordingly favoured the immediate closing down of both stations. 3. It now appears that the Political Resident's view has prevailed. The proposals now under consideration are contained in Tehran telegram to him No.43 of February 23rd, on which the Foreign Office have invited our observations. These proposals may be summarised as follows:- (a) That the Lingah Consular Agency should be reopened, the Agent controlling the wireless station. (The Foreign Office are inclined to agree that this official is the same as the 'censorship official' mentioned in paragraph 2 of the Tehran telegram, which says that the Persian Government have agreed to his controlling the Lingah station). rOAA TeA/vc (b) That the Jask station should be dismantled, sealed up and stored with the Police. (The Persian Government are said to have already given instructions to this effect). Later, if a suitable 1^ J officer be found, the station may be reopened under his control. |' €u 'f' x *' nr ' ^ ^ &gt; 4* The Government of India's telegram below agrees to these &amp; fU. proposals in principle w^the understanding that the expenditure of ^ tb involved will be shar^jbetween Imperial, and Indian Revenues, in « . ' . » accordance with the arrangements for the allocation of diplomatic and 5 ^** consular expenditure in Persia. Presumably the sum involved will not 3 oA be large, and it may well be that it is covered by the arrangement ^ 'j* under which, as a war measure, the Government of India can themselves ^ 0*0 . T sanction expenditure of this sort up to a limit of £ 1,000 a year at each individual post. Probably, however, they have addressed their telegram to the Secretary of State because of the wider issues involved and because the proposals (at least so far as Jask is concerned) fall somewhat outside what is usually understood as diplomatic and consular expenditure. In any case there seems no reason vdiy the Secretary of State should differ from the Government of India and a draft letter is submitted passing on their telegram to the Foreign Office with his blessing. th&amp;JF o oJ~ jrytUrt it (Kfi-t tUi. &amp;(/nu&lt;fYyiL ^\fKovvwv^ , 4 V/.7n o U Financial Secretary For any observations. /V*The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.

There is additional reason for retaining .angah. I have just seen Lean who states it is on the locust immigration route at point served hy no other means of telecommunication. If Lingah is closed down we may get no warning of flights until days or even weeks have elapsed.

By far the best and probably the only solution of this now urgent problem would be the closing of the stations.
