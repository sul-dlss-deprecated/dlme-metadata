I have the honour to inform vi llage you that on the 6th Kay, a deputation of 20 headmen of the Baharena came to see me, v/ith a series of grievances. ^ After some conversation they gave me a list of six main griefe vances which were as follows. 1. They wished Shaikh Khallaf to ret^pn. They said that it was true that another Q,adhi had been appointed, but they did not want the ^a&amp;hizatx Shaikh Khallaf as a ^adhi but purely prayer. A as a XKiigxaiis leader 2. Ekafex They wished that the Majlis al Urfi shd have 3 members from amom&amp;st the rural Buharenah. 3. That the Auqaf shd be managed by a committee of their own, rural and not town people serving on it. They said that they had no objection to the present adinini strati on but that if a committee was formed they she* have a voice on it. 4. They wished,the schhol at Suq-al-Khamis to be given d v , the s c ho M into their j.-iH'cTl control, as all the pupils were from the /v countr people. They said they cd raise the number of boys from 40 to 150 if this was done. 5. They wished Uurah and -lass to be free to all and not a monopoly. 6. iheyw wished that the •Tama*a Hasjid shd not be left in charge of TIuhd Ali Kadni who was not qualified from the religious point of view. They wished Shaikh Ali bin Hassan to be appointed. I told them defintely that I wd have to s eak to he Besi- dent before I cd KXXKxxrqc give any opinion about the return of Skakh -cUiallaf, and that as the other matters were new to m \ have to think them over before making any suggestions As reg'ir^s their first request, I understand that Y.'E. has obtained an opinion from the Shiah Ulema tha . they have not had any harm done to their religious susceptibilities oy the absence of Shaikh iUiallaf, and Y.E. will no doubt take tms into account //hen making a decision. as regards the Lajlis el Urfi, khfiEKzwdxbxznaxh&amp;rmzx if it is true that they are not represented there,then it wd probably be beneficial to appoint one or two from thpir com- munity, n able men can be found among them and if The number of their cases warrant it. x ■ith reference to Waqf, I think that Waqf shd be a Gov- . ifToE do^ ant' 8 th6 CaS6 ln iraq^and Syria! bul if yoE. doe not see y:u r way to do this at present thpn tb» next best thing is to have a council of town and coultrj Shxahs whxch ie v;h.t I understand i being arranged at present with regard to jJurah and -lass, I beleive that matter under consideration and I have no doubt +v,o+ s the t,bl, d,cl,i» n .HI b, ar r i,, a at - 5Wu.t anything in the nature of a monopoly or restraint on trade usually has an unfavourable effect on the ii prosperity of a country, and is to be deprecated- ^j na i ly as regards their last request, as the Govt has appointed ,-.li bin Hassan as ofucial „adhi.

A case has been made in the Bahrain Court by a Bahrain subject against Shaikh Khalaf al Asfur, the ex Shia Kadi in Bahrain. Shaikh Khalaf was born in Bushire and was I believe, registered in the agency as a foreign subject so I refer the matter to you.

M's Political ^gent, Baiirain. \ Memorandum With reference to your No. 52/V.O. dated Blst Jany, 1931. When Shaikh Khalaf, the ex Shia Kadi of Baiirain left Bahrain about 4 years ago, he apnointed one Haji Ibrahim al Houri as his wakil. This indi vidual has been recognised as such by the Bahrain Government and has administered the considerable roperties of Shaikh Khalaf in Bahrain, both lands ouses divers and boats. Some time ago Shaikh Khalaf wrote to Haji Abdu Ali bin Rajab asking his assistance in pro curing permission to return to Bahrain. Haji Abdu Ali bin Rejab, I gather, wrote a diplomatic letter to Shaikh Khalaf exuressing good intentions MMiM called on H. E. Shaikh named and myself urging the necessity of keeping Shaikh Khalaf'out of Bahrein. Later Shaikh Khalaf sent a telegram asking Haji Abdu Ali’s assistance in getting back to Bahrain and finally he sent another telegram appointing Haii Abdu Ali as his wakil which was followed up by a lelter enclosing a regular wakala. Haji Abdu Ali T s son has claims against Shaikh Khalaf, in connection with diving debts and lately approached the court on the subject. The court, 1 for its own information, sent for Kaji Abdu KLi and Haji Ibrahim, who both held wakales. The question as to which of the two was reallv the wakil was referred to Shaikh Abdullah the present Shia Kadi; he wrote a letter to the Court stating that as Ha u Ibrahim^ wakala had not been cancelled he remained the wakil of Shaikh Khalaf, and Haji Abdu KLi’s wakala was void. In any case Haji ^bdu Ali bin Rejab refuses to act as wakil for Shaikh Khalaf.The diving esse to which I referred is now, I believe, in your court. Shaikh Khalsf owns a great deal of property in Bahrain and I have heard that for some time the rents have not been reaching him.

At the beginning of January 1931 Shaikh Khallaf submitted to this High Commission 31-12-1930 . a petition, of which a translation is enelossd, requesting that he might be assisted either to appoint a fresh agent to look after certain property in Bahrain, or to proceed to Bahrain in order to sell that property. The petition wae forwarded to Hie tfajesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain, under my Secretariat endorsement No. 263 dated the 8 th January,1931,(quoted in the despatch under reply), 'fer such action, if any, as he may see fit to take'.

The definite application for passport facilities was not nade until some weeks f later, 5.

It is not the business of the Ruler to provide agents for people who have cases in the Bahrain Courts,especially for persons who created as much trouble in the past as Shaikh Khalaf, and his request for Rs.2,000 as an inducement to leave Bahrain I can only regard as misguided humour. Yours Sincerely, Adviser to the Bahrain^ Government, Bahrain. Captain L.S.Parke27th Hoharraa 1350. Application to the Administrator of Justice, the Adviser to the two Governments in the island of Bahrain. May your dignity and generousity be preserved. After paying my sincere compliments and heartfelt respects to him whom we can not but love. I got your kind letter, yesterday, which contained your kind enquiry about me. I have praised you for that and thank you for all that which may take place infuture in concord with it. You have pointed out that at the time of my arrival, I requested the Political Agent and His Excellency for a period of three months. Yes you are right, I did make this smmll request to the two i greAt persons. May it be known that I did not make this request but for three reasons. The first being that I was unalle to prove'my case, ie. my and my friend’s innocence from indecent talk. I requested for the period to pro-^e that I was not guilty and did not deserve the punishment of ex^lle from my native land. By the Grace of God I ha^e proved that to you, His Excellency Shaikh Hamad, The Political Agent and the Adviser in detail. For I know them that their court yards (hearts) are free from selfish motives. Secondly when began from the Political Agent and the Adviser the present policy which was contrary to my affairs (or dignity) there remained no use in my stay in Bahrain except as I have said explaining the matter to them. This showed the contradictions in the two policies which is not unknown to people like you, the politicians. What ever is done is done, with the praise of God, I leave all that without any compensation.fsx Be it known,oh my master and refuge, I do not want from your kindness and generousity except two things.
