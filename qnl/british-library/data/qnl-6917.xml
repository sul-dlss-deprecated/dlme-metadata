By E. H. PASCOE, D.Sc., M.A., F.G.S., Supdt., Geological Survey of India, MAPS. 1 in. T.C. 227a and part of T.C. 248. i in. T.C. 173, T.C. 225 and part of T.C. 171. INTRODUCTION. On my way up from Tikrit to Qaiyarah the oil indications at Fathah seemed of such importance as to warrant an extended examination before passing on. The Jabal-Hamrin is a long narrow range projecting from the alluvial plain, and extending from Fathah on the Tigris south-eastwards for over 100 miles to the latitude of Shahraban, and across the river north-westwards for another 37 miles under the name of the Jabal-Makhul. The portion under report is that between Ain Nukhailah, 26 miles E.S.E. of Fathah, and Khan Sultaniyah, 23 miles N.W. of the same ancient city and 10 miles S. of Sharqat. The portion of the range delimited is extraordinarily simple and regular, varying from 2 to 2^ miles in width ; the highest point of the Hamrin is some 600 feet above the river, while that of the Makhul is probably nearer 800 feet. With the exception of the Tigris gap, this section of the range is not only unbroken, but its crest follows very closely the rise and fall of the anticline of which it consists, producing an unbroken gently undulating sky-line. The Tigris evidently cuts through the range in a weak spot caused by a considerable local sag in the anticlinal crest combined with a change in the direction of the axis from E.S.E.—W.N.W. (more accurately 62® W. of N.—62° E. of S.) on the left bank, to N.W.—S.E. on the right bank. A sigmoidal curve at Ain Dibs further relieves the monotony. There is not a single tree in the area or within sight of it, and that portion immediately E. of Fathah is particularly barren of grass ; towards Ain Nukhailah grass is more plentiful and water less scarce though slightly brackish. The Jabal-Makhul also supports more vegetation. Small brown partridges like the Punjab Sisi are plentiful, especially in the Makhul, and a few of a larger kind, similar to the Indian Chikhor. are to be found on the higher slopes ; these and their usual companion, the Fox, are the only forms of animal life to claim attention. Exposures are excellent. The ground is much dissected by streams and walking wearisome but not difficult owing to the softness of the strata. The topographical maps available are very sketchy and at times inaccurate, especially in their contours, but they serve to show in a general way the structure of the area. The geological boundaries, it is hoped, are as accurate as the maps permit. The Alluvium is troublesome in concealing the Tertiaries and has been omitted where possible ; to put in the true alluvial boundary would necessitate a separate map. An attempt has been made to separate the red clays and sandstones from the sandstones and conglomerates, in the upper of the two Tertiary series. each side by a series consisting of red clays and sandstones passing up into sandstones and con glomerates. The Mesopotamian Alluvium conceals much of the latter series, but scarcely any of the Lower Fars. Recent gravel is common, and an older conglomerate, probably of Pleistocene age, occurs in small patches at considerable heights near the river. Lower Fars. The predominant constituent of the Lower Fars stage consists of white opaque gypsum, sometimes homogeneous and of a high state of purity, reaching thicknesses of 40—50 feet, at other times stratified with numerous thin lamellae of clay. This deposit is characterised by many- underground caverns leached out by percolating water and sometimes several yards deep, which produce the hollow sound so noticeable when walking on these beds. It weathers in the peculiar way often seen in the case of a homogeneous limestone, the surface becoming scoured by numerous round-sectioned channels like those produced by a cheese-scoop. Although such a comparatively soluble mineral, it resists weathering more than the associated beds of clay ; in fact its resistance to erosion is somewhat surprising. More than half of the Hamrin range consists of this deposit which, there is every reason to conclude, is a sedimentary one. Associated with it are thin bands of limestone which may be comparatively solid and crammed with obscure shells, especially of a small pelecypod, or may consist of a cellular rock identical in appearance with Cunningham Craig’s detrital lime stone ” of the Maidan-i-naftun oilfield of Persia. The latter rock presents the appearance of having been formed of comminuted shell-fragments which have lost their original organic ornamentation and outline, but which are still separated by the original but modified interstices which divided them at the time the^ were strewn along the bed of the sea ; this is the actual oil-bearing rock in the Maidan- i-naftun field, the interstices being filled with oil. In both banks of the river and in some of the small water-courses around Fathah, limestones of this nature are found seeping tarry oil and bitumen. Occasionally recognisable specimens of Pecten and Ostraea are observable in it. East of Fathah there is probably not more than a total of 50 feet of limestone in separate bands exposed ; but in the Jabal-Makhul a distinct increase in the amount and a corresponding increase in the steepness and ruggedness of the cliffs ^re discernible. ROCKS. The rocks comprise a central core of gypsiferous beds belonging to the Lower Fars, flanked on/ 3 •some of the sandstones may have occasionally projected in the form of low mounds. Near the Lower Kars this deposit contains water-worn blocks of white gypsum. One occasionally gets an impression of slight dip in the alluvium. The boundary mapped is purely arbitrary being the approximate limit of Tertiary exposures. • j j k The New Alluvium fringing the river calls for no remarks. STRUCTURE. As already stated the Hamrin and Makhul ranges coincide with a remarkably long and persistent, simple anticline. A second anticline commences E. of the Humr Plain and continues north-north-westwards in the Jabal-Chanuqah. The distance between the two anticlinal axes which are not quite parallel, varies from 3t to 5f miles, the syncline between being occupied by the Red Clay and Sandstone Series. The Hamrin-Makhut anticline is slightly asymmetric, the S.W. limb being a little steeper than the N.E. As the folding movement, in all probability, came from the N.E., being part of that gigantic system of loops which constitute the Himalaya, the Afghan, Baluchistan and Persian mountain systems, we thus remark a tendency for the fold to be pushed over towards the direction of movement. The details of the structure are as follows, commencing at the Mukhailah Pass and proceeding north-westwards. , The crest of the anticline sinks to a minimum close to and a little E. of this pass, E.S.E. of which point it is seen rising gently on a very broad, open, round and regular fold. Across the pass the anticline, omitting slight irregularities on the N.E. side, is practically symmetrical, while the outcrop of the Lower Ears is reduced to about miles in width. W.N.W. of the pass the fold rises very gradually, at first about 2 C —3° but becoming less and less for some 2£ miles where it reaches a maximum altitude. Beyond, the anticline pitches in an equally gradual and gentle fashion for another 2 miles, after which it rises again gradually and steadily as far as the word “ Jabal ” on the £ ins. map, where for two or three miles no perceptible pitch is measurable ; at this crest- maximum the Lower Ears outcrop is over 2f miles in width. It then slowly begins to sink, the pitch gradually increasing to over 5° when a point is reached about a mile from the* Tigris where it once more rises very slightly, forming with a short distance of the outcrop on the west bank of the river, a small dome area, which is slightly steeper on its S.W. aspect than elsewhere, and whose centre is beautifully shewn in the river by concentric ellipses of limestone and gypsum bands, three of the former seeping oil. Up the Jabal-Makhul the crest rises, distinctly at first, less and less perceptibly afterwards. Persistent mist prevented my determining the crest-maxima in this range, but there seems to be a long horizontal stretch immediately S. of Qalah Jabbar, and perhaps another maximum S.S.W. of Mushak. Opposite Ain Dibs there is a distinct pitch of 5° to the N.N.W. With regard to the flanks of the fold, the dip at Ain Nukhailah rises to 40° on each side. Steeper dips occur locally immediately W.N.W., but where sections B—B has been drawn the general maximum dip on the N.E. is about 35°, that on the S.W. between 35° and 40°. On the S.W. flank, some 5 miles from Fathah a small subsidiary wrinkle makes its appearance and persists for about 3 miles giving vertical and reversed dips along the Lower Ears boundary ; this is probably a result of the pitch of the fold. This pitch is accompanied by a flattening of the arch which at Eathah is very broad and gentle. The Jabal-Makhul shows considerable asymmetry at first, dips of perhaps 25° (the maximum dip is concealed beneath alluvium) on the N.E. being balanced by dips of 65°, 75° and 80 on the S.W. Near Jabbar the asymmetry becomes less, 27° on the N.E., and 57° on the S.W. Across Ain Dibs we have about 25° average maximum on the N.E. against 40° on the S.W., the latter flank steepening rather suddenly towards the base of the range. Figures for Makhul must be accepted as approximate only, the river on one side and the alluvium on the other marking the maximum dip. As a whole the crest is broad and rounded in both ranges ; in longitudinal section it is also rounded. The river has pierced the range at a weak spot where the crest has sunk to the small low dome between the two crest-minima, and where the direction of the fold somewhat abruptly changes from 62* W. of N.—62° E. of S. to nearly due N.W.—S.E.; dip-faulting may have assisted the river in this. That this gap dated at least from Pleistocene times, is, I think, shown by the presence in its neighbourhood of the conglomerate of that age. PETROLEUM. Natural Indications. Seepages of tarry oil and bitumen are too numerous on both river banks around the opposite Fathah to be indicated on the map. Bitumen impregnating earth is to be seen at various horizons, and has frequently been forced up vertical fissures. Three separate oil horizons of seeping cellular limestone can be distinctly traced for some distance, passing from one side of the river to the other. “Gouttes” of dark oil are seen continually floating down the river, and have been collected and utilised by the Sappers ; there is a strong odour of Hydrogen Sulphide on both banks. The water trickling from the small streams into the river are milky with suspended sulphur, and specks and patches of this mineral are locally common in the clays and gypsum ; a tarry oil usually contaminates this water and there is then a confliction of the odours of hydrogen sulphide and that of aromatic hydrocarbons. Similar indications were noticed in a stream-course 2£ miles E.S.E. of Fathah on the S. side of the range, and others about 5 miles above Eathah on the N.E. side of the Jabal-Makhul ; these are merely instances and there are doubtless others. Their particular abundance at the gap made by the river may be due to disturbance ot the strata caused by the twist in the anticline and the pitch of its axis. Seepages are frequently found where a fold pitches, perhaps on account of disturbance in the beds. Prospects of Boring. Mr. James divided the Lower Ears of the huge Persian Oilfield into three zones, a, b and c, a being the oldest. The Hamrin beds seem to agree very closely with his b zone, and as the important oil horizons occur in the cellular limestones of the lowest or a zone, there is good reason to suppose that such limestones are within easy access of the drill, tluee at least of these petroliferous limestones, which extend up into his middle or b zone, are evidently repre sented by the denuded seeping limestones on the river banks. The structuie could scarcely be moresuitable the fold being broad, simple, fairly symmetric, gentle, regular and singularly free ftotnf faulting’ with the possible exception of the vicinity of the gap made by the river, where the crest is too low for any faulting to have disturbed possible “oil pools” in the more likely parts anticline. The Jabal-Hamrin is not far from the line of strike of the Mandali and Kirkuk occurrences. We have, therefore, favorable geographical position, eminently favorable structure, beds of the same age as those known to be highly petroliferous in the Persian field and within easy reach of the drill, and abundant seepages, though somewhat local, to confirm this. Altogether the prospects are very good and warrant tests being made on the highest points of the anticlinal crest, one somewhere opposite the word “ Jabal” of “ Jabal Hamrin” on the h in. map T.C. 225, and another south of Qalah Jabbar on the summit of the Jabal-Makhul. The physiographic ft^st of the ridges is usually a little N E of the anticlinal crest, so that a location on the former would allow for the slight asymmetry. There is a graded road up to the crest of both ranges from the river, by which a boiler and engine could be transported. Water is obtainable just below the Hamrin location on the N.E. side, probably in sufficient quantity for a boiler in the wet season. At the Makhul location it could be obtained from the river. COMPARISON WITH OTHER AREAS. It is perhaps premature to draw general conclusions, but the similarity in conditions between this country and the oil regions of India and Burma are worth pointing out. We have a petroliferous series containing saline products and marine fossils, indicative of a dessicated gulf, followed by a fluviatile deposit, the river having in all probability replaced the upper part of the gulf, just as we have in the Punjab, Assam and Burma. The folds become steeper as we approach the eastern margin of the gulf, i.e., the quarter from which the folding movement proceeded. One is tempted to prophesy a “ boundary ” fault close to this eastern margin, either in the Lower Tertiaries or along their base ; its presence would explain the earthquake shocks which occasionally afflict Mesopotamia. A confirmation of such recent movement may exist in the “choked” stream-courses in the Alluvium at the foot of the Hamrin and Makhul. Parts of the courses of these channels have been filled up with silt producing a broad, shallow water-course with a flat floor, which in many cases has been cut into again by renewed activity of the stream, leaving small terraces. Such “choking” would be produced by submergence with respect to the lower parts of these streams, and might indicate continuance of the folding movement in recent times. On the other hand blown dust or a change in rainfall would produce similar choking, so that this evidence is by no means incontrovertible. Choked stream-courses are especially well seen south of the Jabal-Hamrin and also E. and W. of the Jabal-Makhul at Bulalij. E. H. PASCOE, Supdt., Geological Survey of India.

ALLUVIA. • The I ' lver ri « ns flows through a belt of some three miles wide of very recent low-lying alluvium ?t h Ufl S a Sa ^ a u d T C u less permeated with gypsum, and is largely under cultivation. It is flanked on both sides by slightly older alluvium, which form* the rolling plains of Mesopotamia It is moie sandy than that around Baghdad and, N. of Tikrit. is practically unstratified and strongly mpregnated with gypsum ; some of our deep trenches show in what a large proportion this mineral is present not only lilhng small veins and hssures, but impregnating the silt itself. Elsewhere, such as to the S. of the Jabal-Hamrin this alluvium is stratified. Close to the river and over soft Tertiary conglomerates which crop out occasionally, it includes beds of gravel which occur in the pockety w ay so chaiactenstic of this form of deposit; the gravel reaches thicknesses of 20—25 feet and more often than not is overlain by sandy silt. A few feet of Ears beds including a gypseous fossiliferous mai art exposed in the chHs at fikrit, overlain by a current-bedded sand-rock belonging to a Sand- stone Series to which I shall refer to later on. and which may be classed provisionally as Bakhtiari. I he junction of this series with the Ears seems, in fact, to be exposed here : the exposure, however, !s very small and obscure, and has not been coloured on the map. Similar exposures of one or both o these series will no doubt be found in other places, especially along the river cliffs and in some of the deeper stream-courses. The alluvium is pebbley for miles inland, the pebbles being derived from underlying conglomerates belonging to the above-mentioned Sandstone Series ROAD METAL. Pebbles of the gravel range up to 8 or 9 inches across, the vast majority consisting of siliceous material, chert, siliceous sandstone, milky quartz, etc. ; the only other noticeable pebbles are those of an igneous greenstone, rare pieces of homogeneous grey limestone possibly derived from Eocene rocks, and occasionally pieces of black pumice. This gravel—especially the coarser varieties—broken up into angular fragments, would provide road-metal of a high quality. Probably it is already being used for such a purpose. No doubt it occurs lower down the river, nearer Baghdad, and would vastly improve the roads of this city. TREES. The absence of trees in Mesopotamia is, I think, not attributable to thriftless cutting down of timber in former times, since—on the authority of Herodotus if I remember rightly—the Mesopotamian plain has always been practically treeless.' but is the result of the impregnation of the soil with the salt and gypsum derived from the Ears rocks which lie not very far below the greater pai t of the area. Whether any serious effort to grow trees has ever been made, however, seems doubtful, for there should be a good chance of getting suitable trees to flourish along the river banks and along any net-work of irrigation canals that may be constructed. I noticed bushes of the Wild I him (Zizyphus Ju/uba) near Baiji. and trees like Acacia Catechnoides or Acacia Ferrugmea, although not producing much in the w^y of timber, would probably contrive to exist, as they do in similar regions in Burma and India, and would at least provide fuel, and form a humus for other trees. Local patches of soil there must be practically free from salt and gypsum, such as that around Kut. The neutralisation of the effects of these salts—magnesium sulphate, sodium sulphate, calcium sulphate, sodium chloride, etc.—is the serious problem before the agriculturist of this country, especially north of the deltaic area. WATER. The prospects of obtaining sweet water by boring in the plain between Tikrit and the Jabal- Hamrin and Jabal-Makhul are not easy to diagnose. There is such a large element of chance as to the water being sweet or brackish that a geologist can offer no very definite advice. The Red Clay and Sandstone Series (? Bakhtiari) flank the Jabal-Hamrin and Jabal-Makhul, and since it is probably a fluviatile deposit, it is not at all impossible that its upper strata, consisting of loose conglomerates and sandstones, may contain water which has been protected from the saliferous Ears beds beneath by some impermeable band of clay ; thick bands of somewhat sandy clay do occur at the base of this Sandstone Series. The probability is that this series underlies the alluvium over large areas, especially areas not very far from the ranges and parallel to them. The chances of reaching this series with the drill by piercing the alluvium and obtaining potable water, at say 5 or 10 miles from the ranges, are not unreasonable. Near Tikrit the chances are against the water being sweet, since the Lower F'ars is probably very close beneath and the Alluvium full of gypsum. To exemplify how purely a matter of chance it is, the Ain Khalid and Ain Mukhailah springs may be mentioned ; these occur close to the upper boundary of the Lower Ears itself in the Jabal- Hamrin, more than half of which range consists of gypsum. The water is slightly brackish and is drinkable to people accustomed to the small amount of sulphate present ; to those unaccustomed it is not harmful but has the effect of minute doses of Epsom Salts. If it is not desired to penetrate completely the Alluvium, visible stream-courses are preferable sites usually for such shallow wells, since there is a considerable amount of underground drainage in the plains, and this would naturally tend to follow established lines. E. H. PASCOE, 5th Dec., 1918. S.G.P.Bd—1819—2653—200-15-1-19.Alternating with the gypsum and limestone bands are beds of sandy clay, sometimes gypseous and marly, frequently permeated with thin laminae of translucent selenite derived from the gypsum. This clay is typically of a light greenish or brownish pink colour, and is sometimes—as for instance half-way between Fathah and Ain Nukhailah—stained a conspicuous red with ( xide of iron. Both gypsum and gypseous clay in the neighbourhood of oil seepages contain yellow sulphur, and give forth a strong odour of hydrogen sulphide, it is a matter for consideration whether the sulphur and hydrogen sulphide have not originated by the reduction of sulphates by crude oil which has as a result been oxidised to tar and bitumen. Small pockets of red oxide of iron are sometimes to be seen in the gypseous clays. Since neither range is penetrated very deeply by streams, not more than about 600 feet of the Lower Fars are exposed in the Jabal-Hamrin and between 600 and 700 feet in the Jabal-Makhul. Red Clay and Sandstone Series (? Bakhtiari). The Lower I;ars is succeeded by thick beds of somewhat sandy soft red clay containing near the base two or three isolated layers, an inch or two thick, of selenite derived from the gypsum below ; these follow the digs of the clays. One characteristic band occurring within the first 50 feet is that of a light bluish unfossiliferous marl, less than a foot thick ; this was observed in widely separated areas, for instance at Ain Khalid (near Ain Nukhailah) and near Qalat-al-Bint some 16 miles N.N.W. of Fathah. Bands of red brown sandstone, at first very thin and argillaceous, soon appear, and increase in size and purity further up in the series until they predominate over the clays in massive current-bedded sand-rock of medium to coarse texture. Near Ain Nukhailah incipient root-like concretions produced a fretted weathered surface on this sand-rock. Thin gravel or conglomerate bands next appear and one of these forms the line of low mound-like hills which stretches practically continuous from the N. of Ain Nukhaihh to the neighbourhood of the river, where it swings round to the N.W. These mounds have evidently been submerged beneath the alluvial waters and are loosely strewn with gravel which largely conceals the Tertiary beds beneath. This is the highest Tertiary horizon properly exposed, the Alluvium sweeping up its dip-slope. The pebbles in the conglomerates are mostly of siliceous sandstone, chert and white quartz ; they are the same as those in the Pleistocene conglomerate and the recent gravels, which have already been described. The whole of this series seems to have offered a surprisingly feeble resistance to erosion, and is nearly always largely mashed by alluvium, outcrops of sandstone cropping out here and there in the deeper stream-courses. There is'occasionally a decrease in dip passing from the Lower Fars to the red clays, but usually there is no change in dip ; the highest bed of the Lower Fars, a band of white gypsum, is succeeded by a bed of red clay containing one or two thin layers of selenite and the thin band of bluish marl, and there is the appearance of conformity. I $ay “appearance,” because, although my cursory survey with small scale maps was unable to shew that any extensive erosion of the Lower Fars took place before the deposition of the younger series, the change from one to the other is sudden, sharp and distinct ; above the boundary no sedimentary gypsum bands nor fossiliferous limestone occur, the (Ally points in common being a slight resemblance of the clays. It is a line along which one at once suspects unconformity, and I feel convinced that such will be found—perhaps very marked locally—in other localities, and very probably in the area under description when maps of a larger scale are available. This red clay and sandstone series corresponds to the Upper Fars of James Halse and Brown, but I prefer to give it no definite assignation provisionally until more of it has been seen for the following reasons. Dr. Pilgrim split up Loftus “Gypseous Group” into the Fars and Bakhtiari, chiefly, I take it, because he found this group to consist of a lower marine and an upper fluviatile deposit. The Upper Fars of Dr. Pilgrim is a highly fossiliferous marine deposit with a rich fauna. The red clay and sandstone series of the Jabal-Hamrin is unfossiliferous and has every appearance of a fluviatile deposit, and I cannot see why it should not be classed as homotaxially equivalent to Dr. Pilgrim’s Bakhtiari sandstone series, which is described, moreover, as being characterised by red clays at its base and conglomerates further up. The best exposures of the beds is N. of Ain Nukhailah where over 3,000 feet can be studied. They are also well seen, though in less thickness, between the Jabal-Makhul and the Jabal-Khanuqah ; the conglomeratic stage is not present here. When not protected by sufficiently thick alluvial deposits, this series produces the most broken kind of ground which is as bewildering to the eye as wearisome to the feet. Pleistocene. A high-lying conglomerate occurring in the vicinity of the river, at heights varying from about 300 to 500 feet above the Mesopotamian plain, is probably referable to the Pleistocene. It is seen capping the end of the Jabal-Hamrin above Fathah and a small patch occurs on the other side of the river on the Jabal-Makhul. On the hills above the Humr Plain S.E. of Qalat-al-Bint it forms a distinct plateau in places. It is not seen in the higher parts of the Hamrin and Makhul ranges. It lies unconformably upon the Lower Fars and it is doubtful whether any perceptible dip is demonstrable. It is sometimes a tough conglomerate several feet thick but is usually soft enough to disintegrate under the hammer and in many cases is represented only by a loose gravel strewn over the tops of the hills; in the latter case it is only its altitude which distinguishes it from the recent gravel of the Mesopotamian Alluvium. Its pebbles consist of the same siliceous rocks as those forming the Tertiary conglomerates already described, and frequently attain 9—10 inches across, though the average size is nearer 2—3 inches. This conglomerate, derived doubtless from the conglomerates of the Red Clay and Sandstone series, is evidently a gravel deposit of the Pleistocene ancestor of the present Tigris, which must have flowed over a large part of the continuation of the Jabal-Khanuqah overlooking the Humr Plain. Recent. The Mesopotamian Alluvium has been referred to in an earlier report. It has inter- bedded pockets of gravel, to be seen on both banks of the river at Fathah, at the N.W. corner of the Humr Plain and elsewhere. Its pebbles, derived from the Pleistocene and Tertiary conglom erates, consist of the same siliceous sandstone, chert, quartz, igneous greenstone and rarer pieces of grey limestone : in addition fragments of a blue-black pumice were observed between Fathah and Nukhailah. The Mesopotamian Alluvium covers nearly all the Red Clay and Sandstone series, which is not always clearly exposed in consequence ; the very broken ground between the Jabal- Makhul and the hills above Humr, for instance, really forms part of an alluvial plain through which</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002f6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B316</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002f6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B316</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Report on the prospects of obtaining oil in the Jabal-Hamrin and Jabal-Makhul between Tikrit and Sharqat by E H Pascoe, Geological Survey of India'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1918/1918</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-08-22T22:08:53</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>This file consists of a single document and includes three images on the last folio.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 27, and terminates at f 30, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
