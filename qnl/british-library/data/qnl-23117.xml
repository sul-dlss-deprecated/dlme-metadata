I. Ojair. Ojair f half way down the western side of the Dohat as Salwa, is the port of Kasa. There are practically no buildings except a customs shed and khan ( see account in handbook of Arabia, p.oQ8 whici. is substantially accurate. The water supply is near a tower clue west of the Customs and fort| the water is good and probably suf. icient for a batta lion. Supplies nil. The customs pier has 3-4 feet of water at all stages of the tide. Strategic point, the fort, and tower on water supply. Cheesemail considers Ojair to be the ancient Gerra. 2* aatif . The port bf the C^atif oasis, and for the neigbouring tribes. difficult of access, and except at hig; high tide dhows cannot approach the so called pier, which is nothing more than a causeway. Big launches cannot approach closer than the ruined tower in the channel called AbuSLif, except on the top of the tide. Vessels drawing five feet of water could not approach any cloer than Abu 1 Lif atbany stage of the tide. landing is done by donkeys and small boats and is a wearisome procedure. Water is abundant, streams flowing through the oasis in all directions, but their water is to some extent contaminated. The most sanitary site for a camp would be on the egde of the desert due west of ^atif, going round its northern side, the water being obtained from the springs whicl which come out of the ground on the edge of the date palm cul tivation. This site would entail some danger of being cut off from the sea, and as the garrison varies between 500- 1000 with the possibility of tribes swelling the number this would be a serious contingency. A strategic position would be found on the open ground in front of the town, but it would be dominated from the town walls unless confined th the custom buildings. Anp force camped here for any time would be decimated by malaria, which is very prevalent, caravan track to Hasa exists.3 Page 2. Ju'Oail . This is not mentioned in the Handbook of Arabia or on the Admiralty charts but is a thirving and growing port* It is situ ted approximately at the point marked Jabal Hhawair on the Admiralty charts, and is some 30 miles NV.V. of Qatif* It has a well xtsrctxxbuilt stone pier which will take a small dhow at all stages of the tide and has well built customs houses* I have not been there, but examined it carefully from the air, and noticed a curious fact that the town is not comrmesurate in size with the Customs, having certainly no more than 2000 inhabitants. I counted some 80 boats drawn up a on the beach, mostly perling craft. The Q,usaibis aro $oing all they can to push Jubail which is almost entirely owned by them, and it will undoubtedly increase in importance, the drawback being the water sypply which is small. The trade is entirely with the Bedo&amp;in of the neighbourhood, and th^re is no cultivation at all, and consequently no supplies except what happened to be in the bazaars* usefulnesss though a rooky eminence exists to the noerthwards t which might be mode use of. The place is small and could easi ly be contained by two companies, the ground on th^ land side being fcpen though undulating, or at any rate having that appear ance from the air.

Means could be found to cfreck this, and it would be difficult for them to explain the shipments of large quantities of rice, which althougn the staple food of tne Arab coast is little used on tne Persian littoral, who in most years have no need to import grain at all, 8. To sum up. Such a blockade would make us extreme ly unpopular in Bahrain* and thisnwould have to be reckoned with. Their syproahtien would be entierly with the mainland, and considerable political pressure would be necessary. Ojair would be easy to block, Qatif more difficult, and T ubail the most difficult* The normal port for Ilasa is Ojair, and nowadays Jubail Tornthe neighbouring Bedoiun. It must not forgotten that Q^atar, though not a Wahabi port would be only too pleased to sell to them, nd is only three marches further away from Ilasa than Ojair. ITo blockade would be complete which did not make arrangeffints for rationing jatar’s imports from Bahrain and Babai, but it should be possible to arrange this without much difficulty.P.A The following is the approixmate number of tribes-men of Qatifs- S Quth and south-west of Qatif Ban!

It is ? kilo metres j^ast of the track from *:iyaah to Koweit, and /forth of the Dahana sands. The name indicates an area of water holes. It is in this case a wide depression full of T - u bushes and a marked feature. There is a 1 rge and deep DidhtL - (used aa a retreat from the heat by the oil engineers in summer;) They hare two water bores and one experimental oil bore. The water is said to be the finest in Arabia and it is extrersefy good. Oil has not yet been struck.

I mat howev r confess that accurate Information from / *ab sources on this subject is almost impossible to obtain. - v 2 . It will be remembered that the religious settlements of thjc 'Iliiv/an' (brethren) date from 191. A g neral description of their character and. objects is given in Afield notes on audi j raola ’, 1935, ages 32 and 33* The original idea was to establish agricultural setticmen s throughout the various tribal areas, peopled by Joe more fanatical elements of dsuihabi Arabs, in order not only to break up the existing nomad and tribal organisation for the benefit of the state, but to retain the services of the fanatics and divert them from raids into Iraq and Kuweit, for ing them by degrees into the nucleus of a territorial and national army. Mr# /hilby’s book M The leapt of Arabia”, published in 1922, contains many references to Ikhwan, settlements and to the hopes which were then cherished as to their motional,non-tribal, usefulness. 3# Hr. de Gaury, however, now informs me taint in the o inion of many Arabs with whom he talked recently at . iyadh the Ikhwan movement is dead# Appendix IV, page 130, of 'field Notes' draws attention to the gradual lowering of the strict religious standards which had been the boast of the first settlers in 'Ikhwan” co .unities. It appears that tills deterlorati 3n of religious seal has gone on at an increasing rate. ueh settlements as re lain are no longer purely religi us colonics: the increasing tide of pros erity and security against tribal raids lias resulted in a good deal of tribal settlement, and the Ikhwan colonies have become merged into, and swallowed up by, tribal settlements which have little or no connexion with strict /ohhabi tenets. In some cases Mr# de Gaury knew from personal experience that settlements mentioned in the lists no longer exist at all: for example, the colon y called Mlreira” in t' e Ajnan tribal territory, which never had more than about four houses, is now completely deserted. Ttas tenaoncy towards tribal settlement is well shown by such scliemes as the agricultural development at Hliarj, ab &gt;ut which a separate re &gt;ort has been submilied. I have, etc# (Sgd#) P.H.

We have no one in our present organization who can do this job. probably know. The problems of transportation of this country, and particularly the problem of the supply of eqiipment and spare parts, have been of concern to Mr. Bird for some time. Some months ago he asked us If we could sug gest someone in our organization who could make a survey upon which could be based an estimate of the country’s require ments. We had no one available then and eventually Major LeBlanc, whom I think you met, made the survey. We have been helping Mr. Bird from time to time by giving him any advice or information that we have been able to contribute. We have had some good transportation men, but they have been returned to the United States. When we last en quired they were in great demand there and unavailable. I shall be glad to enquire again, but in the meantime I assume that it would be your wish that we continue to keep in touch with Mr. Bird in connection with this problem.
