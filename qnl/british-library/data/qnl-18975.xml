Kemball suggests that the Acting Collector of Customs, Richard Spooner’s suggestion of introducing papers under Article V of the General Treaty signed with the Arab tribes, would invoke distrust and apprehension. Kemball suggests the reintroduction of a Government notification of 1839, imposing double duties on vessels coming to Karāchi from Arabia and Persia. Kemball also discusses the extent of his own jurisdiction in the Gulf, in relation to trading ports, and questions the widespread use of registration papers at Bombay. Kemball encloses a list of the Arab and Persian ports in which he has jurisdiction (folio 32v) and the proposed wording (in Arabic, folio 33) of a register that he recommends for introduction.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023655810.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
