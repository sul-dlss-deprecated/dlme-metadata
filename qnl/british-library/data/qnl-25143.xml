M 1 ' Sir, 1^22 JAN 1912,) ./ith reference to your despatch no. 344, of the 29th ultimo, on the subject of the state of feeling prevailing in Afghanistan with regard to the furco-Italian war, it may be of interest to you to know that reports have recent -ly rea cried me from a secret native source here, the value of which I am, however, unable to gauge accurately, to th© effect that certain quarters in Constantinople, presumably Young Turkish, are sending emissaries to Afghanistan with a view to making trouble among the Afridi and iiuksai (?) tribes, with the support, if possible, of the Amir. The object is said to be to induce England in this l way to take up a favourable attitude towards urkey in iier present difficulties.

I reported in my last two diaries the feelings of the public here about the Italo-Turkieh war. Muhammadans The are all angry with the British (jorernment. Hie Majesty the Amir is also sorry over its attitude with regard to the passage of Turkish troops through igypt* He thinks that the said government Is at the bottom of the conflict and that, if the passage | is not allowed, he shall be convinced of it. Outwardly he has assumed an attitude of equanimity, but inwardly is much afflicted and watches the development of events j very keenly. The sketch map of the seat of war, which was submitted with my last diary, was designed to serve the purpose of showing the progress of events and to create sympathy with the Turks and enmity towards the British government. 5d. Malik Talib Mehdi Khan, British Agait at Kabul.Confidential. Simla -o 16th ITovemher L’ly dear Hirt zel, With reference to your demi-official letter to McIIahon, dated the 18th Octoher, I cm desired to say that the Government of India have received no information about the alleged arrival of a high Turkish official in Afghanistan v. ith the object of inducing the Amir to conclude c treaty of alliance Vv ith Turkey.
