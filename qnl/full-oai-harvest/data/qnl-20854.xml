Jones writes that he now considers the Shaikh of Dammām to be the real instigator behind the Al bin Ali tribe’s actions, a view which Jones says is corroborated (folio 65) by the Native Agent at Bahrain [Hajjī Jāsim]. Jones also writes that some of the Al bin Ali tribe have settled in territory belonging to the Wahabee [Wahhābī] ruler, and that he has written to Fayṣal ibn Turki Āl Sa‘ūd (folio 68) to draw attention to this fact. Jones recommends that a small steam vessel be dispatched to the area, to discourage further maritime hostilities.The following enclosures follow Jones’s letter:1. A letter (folios 61-62) from Shaikh Mahomed bin Abdullah [Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh], ruler of Dammām, to Jones, dated 21 October 1855;2. A letter (folio 63) from Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh of Dammām, to Jones, dated 27 November 1855;3. A letter (folio 64) from Ali bin Sultan, the Al bin Ali chief, to Jones, dated 19 November 1855;4. The translated purport of a letter (folio 65) from Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim], the British Agent at Bahrian, to Jones, dated 23 November 1855;5. The translated purport of a letter (folio 66) from Shaikh Mahomed ben Khuleefah [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah], chief of Bahrain, to Jones, dated 25 November 1855;6. The translated purport of a letter (folio 67) from Jones to Hajjī Jāsim, dated 1 December 1855;7. The translated purport of a letter (folio 68) from Jones to His Highness Ameer Fysul [Fayṣal ibn Turki Āl Sa‘ūd], dated 24 December 1855.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x00001c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
