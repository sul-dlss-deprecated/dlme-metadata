The map, with accompanying key, indicates: rocks; sand and silt banks; rapids; the remains of an ancient bund, or embankment; the probable line of a canal or tram; buildings at Ahwáz, including mosque and fort; the nature of land on the right bank of the river (cultivated, uncultivated, good camping ground, level plain). Numbered annotations on the map refer to descriptions, written by Wells, in the enclosing volume (ff 87-88).A note at the bottom of the map states that the map was produced in the Intelligence Branch of the Quartermaster General’s Department in India, Simla, October 1884, and examined by ‘J.A.A.’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Karun River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ahwaz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Rivers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049434215.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
