No. 3154-Confidential, dated Bushire, the 26th November (received 9th December) 1912. From -lieutenant-colonel Sir Percy Cox , K .C.I .E., C.S.i., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, giving cover to a letter No. 459, dated 13th November 1912. Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah, in . which the latter begs that Grovernment will be pleased to assist him m furnishing the Town of Kuwait with an adequate Water Supply. 2. Captain Shakespear mentions that he has been told by a British Engineer in Busrah, who has visited the locality, that the prospects of obtaining water by sinking artesian wells is not unsatisfactory and he suggests the deputation by the Government of India of a Geological expert, with experience of artesian wells, to examine and report on the prospects before further action is taken. 3. On reference to my records, I find that Mr. G. E. Pilgrim, who was deputed by the Government of India in 1905, to report on the Geology of the Gulf generally, did not visit Kuwait, and in his Memorandum on the Water Supply of the Persian Gulf, in connection with the establishment of a Quarantine Station at Hormuz, Director, Geological Survey of India letter _ makes no mention at all of Kuwait, No. 925, dated 2nd March 1906, received under whilst his fuller report on the Geology of the dXd g LdX rt '906 endOr8ementNO ' 1797 ' E ' B '' Persian Gulf only refers to Kuwait inciden- k Memoirs of Geological Survey of India, Vol- tally and does not afford any data OU wllicll r ume xxxiv, Part iv, page 148-149. an opinion as to the possibilities for artesian wells in this area could be formed. 4. The visit of an expert Geologist to Kuwait is, moreover, very desirable on other grounds. I have already suggested to Government the expediency of obtaining from the Resident to Foreign, No. M.-170, dated 13th Shaikh of Kuwait an option or concession Ci June 1912. for minerals in Kuwait territory, in which Foreign to Resident, No. 365, dated 22nd June 0 j} deposits which are known to exist y : there would be included. The Government i of India did not then consider the moment opportune for action in this direction, but in view of the active measures now being taken by a group composed of the v • + at n a ^ oo ^ Deutsche Bank, the National Bank of India Foreign Office to Mr. Greenway, August 23rd, i , i m n m . ^ 1912. (Persia—Confidential Print 35252.) and. the obeli transport Company to obtain Mr. Marling to Foreign Office, No. 816-Con- a concession from the Porte with a view to ^ fidential, dated 28th September 1912. (Asiatic exploring the Oil Deposits of Mesopotamia, l- October m) Arabia - Confidential Print ' 818 ' and other parts of Turkish Empire, it seems y ' that we may be constrained before long to approach the Shaikh with a view to obtaining prior rights within his territory and preventing any attempt on the part of the Porte to include the Kuwait Oil Fields within any concession which it may grant. In this connection I would beg reference , r ^ , r „ „ , ' to the marginally cited letter of which the . / Mr. Greenway to Mr. Maxwell, dated 21st if x t : 'L ii; ^ October 1912, enclosing notes for evidence to Government ot India have, no doubt, re- 'Y be given before Royal Commission on Oil Sup- Ceived a Copy, in which the Director of the ply.

The present opportunity for effecting a careful examination of the Oil Fields of Kuwait territory by an expert geologist, whilst nominally examining the potentiali ties of artesian wells in this region, is a most favourable one and not likely to recur, and both on this ground, and with a view to doing our best to meet Mubarak's wishes in the matter, I beg that Government will be pleased to give the question their benevolent and favourable consideration. 5. In regard to the expediency of co-operation with Shaikh Mubarak, I would observe that, in dealing in regard to such matters with the somewhat unbusiness like Arab potentates of the Gulf, it is always of importance to take them while they are in the mood and to strike while the iron is hot.

Kuwait, Xo TTift Political Reaideat m the Persian Gall Baahixft. 1 have the honour to enclose herewith a letter in original from Shaikli Sir MnUrak-aa-Subah, K.C.LE.. to vonr address together with a translation trom which it will be apparent that the Shaikh begs the assistance of Government m furnishing the town of Kuwait with an adequate water-supply. 2 The supplv of water to this town has become a very serious matter in its development, and' I will, therefore, endeavour to explain how the present necessity has arisen The town used to be supplied from wells on its outskirts, all more or less brackish and shallow, giving what was reailv only the scanty percolation of ea-'h season's rain water. When the rainfall was slight, numbers of these wells gavs out while the remainder became still more brackish as tney were deepened. In 1908 owin' partiv to the failure of the rains during the winter of 1907-OS and partly to the bad'pearl season of 1907, reducing the pearling fraternity to poverty, it oc curred to some dhow-owners to employ their vessels in the ofE-season by carrying water from the Shatt-al-Arab. The idea at once commended itself to owners, wn} were thus able to emplov their vessels to some profit in the off-season and to boatmen and divers, who are at the same time ordinarily without emplovment ana could thus earn a living. It was found that water so brought could be sold cheaply and vet return a sufficient profit so that within a year there were at least 20 native craft engaged solely in this trade. Consequently the donkey-owners, who formerly brought water in s r kins from neighbouring wells, finding themselves hard put to it for a living, sold oft their animals and took to other trades. 3. As the town's population increased and the advantages of good water from the Shatt-al-Arab came to be more appreciated, the number of boats employed rose until in 1910 there must have been at least 40 to 50 large boats alone, specially fitted with tanks for the trade and carrying from 3,000 to 5,000 gallons a trip, each vessel taking at least one trip every 4 to 6 days. By this time the town had become so dependent on the water brought by these boats that a severe storm, lasting only three days and preventing the boats from putting to sea. would cause a water-famine. Serious shortage of water began to be felt during the summer of 1911 when, owing to the previous good pearling season having stimulated the demand for divers, the water-boats experienced difficulty in obtaining crews. At the same time the population of the town continued to increase rapidly as trade recovered in sympathy with improvement of the pearl-market, and during the last two years there has been in consequence a large influx of Persians of the artisan and labouring classes, who have taken up a more or less permanent residence in Kuwait. 4. During the past summer (1912) the shortage of water was much more severely felt than formerly, though approximately the same number of 'water-boats continued to ply. This was the case when the town's population is at its lowest owing to the absence of the pearling dhows with their crews ; on the return of the pearling fleet at the beginning of the cold weather the shortage became even more acute, and it has now become chronic. During the 3j years I have been in Kuwait, the growth of the town in population has been very noticeable, several new bazaars have been opened and all are thronged, a large number of new boats have been added to the pearling-fleet, most of whose crews have to find dwellings in thetown, tlie demand for buildings lias increased to such an extent that masons', carpenters' and coolies' wages have nearly doubled as has also the cost of materials, such as bricks, stone, ' juss,' rafters and other wood. The shortage of water has been so severe that some of the old wells have been re-opened and the brackish water from them sold not infrequently at the rate of S 1 (Re. 1-8) or more for two skins, containing together not more than 20 gallons. 5, To meet the water difficulty, and probably with an eye to profit himself, the Shaikh ordered from England a water-tank steamer of 300 tons capacity. The vessel has not yet arrived though expected shortly, but as 300 tons represents some 18,000 kerosine tins (the universal water measure) it will be seen that with only one trip in three or four days, which is the utmost she can attempt, her pre sence will not go far towards alleviating the present difficulty, even assuming her to work regularly without delays or break down. Moreover, the difficulty tends to increase rapidly owing to the steady increase of population and the fact that many of the poorer classes, who once drank brackish water ' faute de mieux,' having now become accustomed to sweet river water no longer consider potable that with which they were formerly satisfied. Further, there are indications that the tr-.de of the town is attracting to it merchants and others of the better class from Turkish Arabia and Persia, a fact which tends to raise the standard of comfort and so produce an ever-growing demand for a plentiful supply of good water I trust that the above paragraphs have made it clear that there is at the moment a reallv urgent need for a good water-supply and that any method contemplated must take into account a far larger demand in the near future than is at present apparent. ^ ^ ^ shaikh's requirements. The subject has frequently come up in conversation with him, and I have discussed the relative merits and WbUities so far as I was able to as a layman, of a large condensing plant utihs- o- water such as I believe is installed at Aden, and of artesian well-borings. These^re^he alternatives the Shaikh contemplates in his letter, for no other system water-supply seems possible in a sandy flat waste whieh conld not become a llhrnent arel even if the nncertain rainfall of some 6 to 9 mches per annnm could snffloe to provide an adequate amount of water. • • r j tn 7 The Shaikh having heard of the condensing plant at Aden is inclined to ( tw nnrticAilar method. The main objections to a large condensing plant f^w^uld ^ave to suppty the wants of a town'whose population is at present estx- ^d 't betwen S and 50,000 souls) are, however la) Heavy initial cost in buddings, machinery, e c. ,, ft Heavv recurring cost of fuel, whether coal or oil; an oil-fuel P^t won d became ^available from 6 th^An^o-Persian'cfil Company at Abadan.^ {C) ^ e p™ently n toained^ ^afl^^icli^would 'haTe^to ^ ^for loTal Fabour would be difficult to tram beyond the grade of firema .

Jifr jT irnffTfirtlig^V iu . understand that the Government of Bombay have sunk many artesian wells in various districts of the Presidency, and perhaps some reliable information and expert opinion could be obtained from* it. 9. It will be seen from the Shaikh's letter that he is quite agreeable to the whole work being carried out by Government as a Government concern, with its own officers to remain indefinitely in charge and the enterprise to continue in Government's hands. In this case he would fix a regular rate, calculated to make the plant self-supporting, at which the water would be sold, profit or _ loss owing to fluctuating demand falling on Government. On the score of efficiency there is no doubt that some such arrangement would be an advantage, particularly if a condensing plant is decided upon. The Shaikh is equally agreeable to the work being executed by Government or by contractors under Government supervision on his behalf, and being then handed over to him at its cost price ; all he asks in that case is that he may be permitted to pay the bill by suitable instalments. 10. The point which the Shaikh's letter does not make very clear is the urgent necessity for the work, for I know that he contemplates it being possible to have a water-supply by one of the methods suggested in full working order by next April or May ; and it is true that, when the pearl-boats leave for next year's season, this town will suffer to a degree not experienced hitherto from the want of water. Further, the Shaikh is convinced that he must make some adequate arrangement for a proper water-supply at once, he does not care at what cost as the necessity is so great, and he can see no way out of the difficulty without the assistance of Government. He therefore leaves it entirely to us to make what arrangements we think best for a permanent supply, knowing that he can make no suggestions in so technical a matter which are likely to be of any use. 11. I would solicit, therefore, your earnest support towards assisting the Shaikh in this matter in which he has shown so enlightened a public spirit, and particularly in order that the project may be taken in hand at as early a date as possible. Per haps Government would be prepared to depute an officer with the necessary ex perience of artesian wells to visit Kuwait for a preliminary investigation on the spot, after which it may be possible so to expedite the work as to realize in part, if not entirely, the Shaikh's desire that some plant should be in working order by the beginning of next summer. Translation of a letter, dated the 28th Zul-al-Kaada 1330 {9th November 1912), from Shaikh Sir Muharak-as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K. C. 1. E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments—• We would represent to your High Honour that I, your friend and (am) depend ent on the regard of the Precious Government upon me and upon my home-land, (which regard) has increased our town of Kuwait with inhabitants and popula tion and I see all that, that it is from the counsels (utterings) of the Precious Gov ernment, May God assist it with Glory and Fortune and make us suitable to the gaining of its approval. I beg from the Precious Government, through your High Honour, assistance ior us m the bringing of water for our town, (which, as we have represented is troubled from the shortage of sufficient water); we bring it from the Shatt-al-Arab and it is insufficient and there happen difficult winds to the boats and they are delayed ; and the wells do not suffice and we are much worried over water and we ask the help ot the Precious Government by one of two methods which may brina out water for us, whichever may be best in your view, either a machinery plant for making it from sea-water or by digging which may produce water from the earth And when your Honour decides on one of these two ways, if the Precious Govern ment orders there should be an officer from them we would put a fixed price on a kerosme-tin or if it should be to me your dependent the cost should be upon me in instalments such as you may approve. Without the help of the Government upon us m bringing water we will be worried about water and we have represented ment to our ^heln foJ 0 thi arL , ^ ve benevolence of the kindness of the Govern- ' el P lor object and we expect kindness and benevolence This (is what was necesary) and the order is with you.

H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this DepTrtment on tht -respects of obtainmg potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Jfrospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf. I arrived on the 20th February, 1913, and spent a fortnight in and around Date and locality. Koweit, endeavouring to form an opi- ,? llon as nature and age of the country-rock below the sand, and the likelihood of its capability of retaining water fit for drinking purposes. 4 Koweit lies on the coast of the Arabian Desert in a small arm of the Persian Gulf at its north-western extremity. The desert stretches inland for at least 200 miles, without a hill-range and probably without an exposure of rock. There are no exposures at Koweit, and Rocta at Koweit. p 6 ^ h f ( r ^ r0ck f ^ nd is ' L itoral or Concrete mentioned by Dr. Pilgrim as common m the Gulf. Below the surface, at various inconstant hori zons, pebbles and sand are occasionally cemented together into calcareous or gypseous bands sufficiently coherent to influence the under ground flow of surface water. Around Koweit an efflorescent salt, similar to that found in Burma near exposures of Pegu beds and to the Eeh ' of India, is common on the surface, especially in damp places. A foot or so below the surface a band of gypsi- ferous sand, some 9 inches to Ij feet thick, is very commonly found, the gypsum is derived from subjacent Tertiary beds. With the aid of surface fires this material is partially dehydrated, and the product known as ' jus containinfy a certain amount of '' plaster of Paris '' and perhaps a little lime, is used as a cement for building purposes. This small industry covers quite a large area. Most of the water obtained from surface wells (from 10 to 20 feet deep) is slightly brackish. By the kindness of Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, I was able to visit for a couple of days a low hill known as Wara and some small knolls, and rising ground, known as Burqan, 24 miles south of Koweit. These, fortunate- Wara and Bu rq an. Jf' of rock though of very limited extent only. Wara is a small truncated cone, some 20 to 25 yards across its flat top, and projecting 50 or 60 feet above the desert plain. It is capped by a conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone about 4—5 feet thick ; the pebbles of the conglomerate are small and consist mostly of quartz. It lies practically horizontally, dipping in one place at 8—10° towards north-west. A glimpse of the underlying beds is obtained on one side of the hill; they appear to be identical with those seen at Burqan. The conglomerate has every appearance of a Bakhtiari bed, and for reasons to follow it probably represents the base of this series. Burqan consists of a series of low ridge-like knolls grouped along or parallel to the perimeter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Conglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at the edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sand- /anrl mnnv laree frasincnts of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Makes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills and the efflorescent salt m the cental plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface of Dr Pilgrim's Fars series. 1 am inclined to think the Fars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone represen- ting the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Fars exposure would be abouU mile long by f mile broad. Between Koweit and Wara the desert is pebbly all the way, except in a few bare grass -less patches covered with efflorescent salt. Small shrubs also increase ^ j n num ber towards Wara and Burqan, Between Koweit and Wara. where they are quite plentiful; this may be a result of the rise of the more or less impervious Bakhtiari conglomerate to- wards the surface. ^ Kubbar and Q^arain Islands were disapgfcjtong. The latter is about 4 miles west of Koweit, and contains no rock except the recent htoral ragstone The same stone was found all round the beacli of - Kubbar and Qarain Islands. Kubbar, which is 35 miles SOUth -east of Koweit. Four and-a-half miles east-south-east of this island, a smooth patch of fresh water was observed in the sea and reported by the Commander of H. . S. 'Lapwing'. A copy of this report, kindly supplied by Captain Shakespear, is appended. The geo-tectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere 1.4- nnrlN -W S -E. This is borne out by the orientation of the Burqan d^me and 'the reTative position of War. kl (a little west of 01 me CU H ^ ( n ) by the general structure. strike and trend of the Persian Gulf and Euphrates and Tigris valleys, (♦*) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a cir cumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf, which shows a very gentle eastwards shelving along the Arabian side, but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. From this we may deduce that easterly dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. This fact and general consi derations are conformable to the view that the subjacent Tertiary strata m and around Koweit have been very little disturbed by folding movements. After these preliminaries it is possible to consider the question of finding water at Koweit by artesian boring. The Tertiary rocks beneath the thick superficial cap of Hecent sand consist in all probability ot Water - Dr. Pilgrim's ' Fars ' series and perhaps some of the basal beds of the overlying Bakhtiaris. We have evidence for this m the superficial gypsiferous band at Koweit, the nature of the Burqan and Wara beds, the brackishness of many of the Koweit and neighbouring wells, ?.nd to some extent the intermediate position of Koweit between an Upper Tertiary outcrop mapped by Dr. Pilgrim some 30 miles west of Basrah and the Nummulitic rocks of Bahrein*. As to the depth at which Tertiary rocks occur below the surface at Koweit, we may at least hope that the Burqan and Wara exposures denote a line of uplift whose strike would pass through Koweit and the Basrah out crop, and that although the westerly indent in the coast forming Koweit Bay may denote a local depression of the Tertiary rocks, these rocks are not beyond the reach of the drill. The Fars series is a porous one, and if it can be reached, water ought to be found at some horizon or other, although it is not, I believe, been plentifully met within the oil borings near Ahwaz. The most serious consideration, however, is whether any of it would be fresh enough for drinking purposes. A great part of Arabia and Persia are more or less permeated with rock-salt, gypsum and ' reh'; in fact, the water of the upper part of the Persian Gulf is said to be actually Salter than that ot the ocean (Gulf Pilot Capt. C. G. Constable and Lieutenant A. W. Stiffe). I n tlie Burma Pegu series, which corresponds very closely to the Fars in age and character, *8 ee Geological map, Mem, Geol, Survey of India, Volume XXXIV, Part 4.3 fresh water has occasionally been found, though most of it is brackish; it is not unlikely that some water-bearing bed in the Fars may also be found free from rock-salt and gypsum. It may not be necessary, however, to penetrate into the Fars beds. In fact, there seems to me better chances of obtaining potable water from the superjacent Bakhtiari sandstones if these exist belew Koweit, and better chances still from the lowest horizons of the desert sand. One of the Bakhtiari conglomerates would be capable of holding up large quantities of water; a few miles south of Burqan water is so held up in considerable quantity and of good quality. It will be seen that the evidence to go upon is meagre in the extreme, and in ordinary circumstances, one would be very loath to advise such an expensive opera tion as boring on such scanty data. But Boring. i n v i ew of the extreme scarcity of water and the crying necessity of the people here, who, out of the pearling season, number some 40,000, and also in face of the fact that no artesian experiments have ever been made along this coast, I have no hesitation in strongly recommending trial borings at Koweit. The great element of uncertainty seems to me well worth ignoring on account of the great importance of the object. One of the most hopeful signs is the reported occurrence of fresh water off Kubbar Island mentioned above, tap- tain Shakespear and I were unable to find this, but there is a well-known examp e of this at Bahrein, and the ''Lapwings'' testimony is quite definite enough. 1 do not think this water can have come from the Shatt-el-Arab ; m the first place, fres water being less dense than salt, there would be a connecting strip of fresh water between Kubbar and the Shatt-el-|lrab, and, in the second place, the distance seems too great. It is far more likely that there is a submarine spring. As drilling would be undertaken more or less blindly, no local spot, as far as is known would be preferable to any other; I should select one unlikely to be contaminated with foul surface water, convenient for the inhabitante amoved as far as nossible from the 'ins'' areas. The best method of drilling would be tne American cable system, and the most suitable engine to ^Z^/i^btaLing internal combustion oil-engine, since there would be, great ™ of Messrif fresh water for a steam boiler. A suggestion made by Mr. C -f ica - Shaw and Havnes (Basrah), who has had expermece with water-wells m Amer , semns to ine a sound one, namely to procure at first a th drilling to deep horizons (3,000 feet or more), and pipe apparatus ™™ble tor exn oration of depths up to about 700-800 feet.

Boats were lowered and it was sounded out, and soundings were found to agree with chart, but the water was nearly fresh.

No. 165, dated Kuwait, the 29th April 1913. — C aptain W. H. I. S hakespear , I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence relative to a scheme for the water- supply of this town ending with your Second Assistant's endorsement No. 484, dated the 15th February 1918, I have the honour to forward herewith an advance copy of the report made by Mr. E. H. Pascoe of the Geological Survey of India, the officer deputed to inspect local geological conditions. 2 l presume the report is now under the consideration of the Government of India and their orders thereon will issue in due course. In the meanwhile, however, I w 7 ould urge that the question of a water-supply for this town is an urgent and pressing necessity and that it is important that a conclusion should be reached at a very early data whether the experiment of . boring tor artesian w T ells be undertaken or a condensing plant be installed. 3. By the courtesy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company I am enabled to furnish the following approximate figures on which the cost of drilling a well 3,000 feet in depth may be estimated roughly (a) Derrick rig and tools with oil engine for motive power £1,200. (b) Casing for lining well varies according to diameter from 10s. 6i. to 2s. &amp; 6rf. per foot for diameters from 15 inches to 6 inches. (a) Canadian driller's wages £30 per mensem with £5 for messing and servant's allowance. (d) Seven native labourers are required to assist each driller with the plant. (e) To work the drill efficiently it should be run 16 hours daily, thus 2 drillers and 14 labourers working in two shifts of 8 hours each are required for each drill. 4. Indian experience will probably furnish approximate estimates for the amount of water required for the town during each 24 hours, hut as the esti- mates may he affected by local conditions, I would observe here that : — (a) The population of Kuwait is estimated at from 40,000 to 50,000 souls and is increasing rapidly ; also that a considerable larger supply is V * ;rpc ui'rea during tlif hot treather montlis froHi 1st May to 13th O tober than for the remainder of tho year. IV:The population at present uses sweet water only for _ drinking and ( ' cochins purposes, and, so far a^ my enqumes go, m the ordinary 1,o^ehold at present from 1 to 2 gallons per head is so consnmed; thus supply of some 80,000 to l,00,00u gallons daily is required as a minimum. M AH washing is at present done with the hraeldsh water ohtainahle ( ' from .he ^lls listing in nearly every house : hut it sweet water 'as easilv available and cheap, a large number^ the better class people would ii«e it in preference. Consequent^ an increase in demand on this account requires to be foreseen. - The An^lo-Persian Oil Company of Mohammerah, who have now an ■- 1 ' e ,,,, .{1 to quote for such work and plant, Engmemag Bepartment and ar. p 8e freshwater from the sea, inform me t '^; a '/'P°^, P ' a e ' r 24 h-mrs, would cost from £2,000 to £3,00'; fuel, staff, buildings, etc. 6 I have submitted the aloove details in the hope that t^e in crmation, meagre and speculative though it be ; may prove of use in ^ estioiating the Sable and possible requirements of tbe town and m woi-hing the advan ces and objections respectively attaching to a supply dependen on the two methods indicated. The most important points to oe borne in mma are . (a) That some system of supply is very urgently require 1. (5) That the system must be such as to acimit ci the wa.er being aval- able easily and above all cheaply. It would appear that though artesian wells mny be the more expensive in initial cost, the subsequent working expenses would be so smau (m coniparisnn with a condensing plant) that water would be cheap and p^ntfui. I ur, ier I ■would venture to submit that the whole initial cost of the onilmg plant need not fall upon Kuwait, if Government are prepared to us- toe p.am -i 'Fo ments at other places such as Bushire, Banram am ^...ndar wb .e somewhat similar though less acute difuculty in the provision oi a good w.uer- supply also presents itself. 7.

In continuation of my letter No. 2047, dated the 3rd Apvil 1913, I 'have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. B. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, upon the prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf. Frospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf. Some miles south of Kuwait, a small area of Tertiary rocks projects above the surface of the Desert, and is lutroduction. known as Burqaa. I examined it between the dates 2nd to 5th March, 1913. Burqaa is close to the rock known as Wara, and consists of some small knolls and rising; ground The knolls are Eocks ■ ridge-like and are grouped along or parallel to the permiter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately fiom north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls Comglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has a scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at its edges and a great deal of scree but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneatn it. Eolow it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolia-bearing sandstone, and many lar^e fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Makes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills, and the efflorescent salt in the central piam All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surtace ot Dr Pilgrim's ' Pars series. I am inclined to think the Pars beds are actually exposed* the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone representing the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Pars exposure would be about a mile long by f mile broad. The '-eotectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between north, south and north -west-south-east. This is borne out (i) by the orientation of the Burqan dome and the structure. relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of north from Burqan), («) by the general strike and trend of outcrops in Persia and further south in Arabia, (Hi) by the trend of the Persian Gulf and 'Punl-rates and Tigris Valleys, («»/t'y Uie direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a c rcumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf which shows a very eenUeeastward shelving aloag the Arabian s.de but a comparatively steep drop inbf deep water along the Persian coast. Prom this we eastcrlv-dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total a.ea than westerly-dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle oae. \little bituminous earth is found in the central plain. The prospects of obtaining an oil supply depend 0*7 P rino , ! f 1! .7 ^ 11 the age and the capacity tor storage 0il - of the rocks, (n) structure, {in) _ position with resard to the oil belt.' , The age of the beds is favourable, it it is correct Assume they belong to the Pars, since this is the oil-bearing series in Peisia. -no reason to believe the nature of the beds beneath Burqaa should be different from that of the Pars in Persia, and they may be looked upon theretore 1 (r • .1 -norous to retain oil in workable quantities, ihe structure, if correctly diagnosed, is also favourable, a gentle dome in fact being an excellent C10FDtype of folding suitable for an oil-field. As to its geographical position, this locality is not on the line of strike of the rich oil deposits now being worked above Ahwaz, and is, in fact, over 170 miles to the south-west of this line. This does not necessarily mean that oil in commercial quantity does not occur below Burqan, but it adds a decidedly speculative element to any operations. A 'floating tract of naphtha,' coiociding no doubt with a submarine seepage was described by Captain Constable as occurring between the islands of Qaru and Kubbar, some 56 miles soutb-east of Burqan. On the whole, my opinion is that the chances are not unfavourable, and that an oil company would not require much inducement to test it, if protection and permanency of concession were guaranteed. The central plain of Burqan would be the best site for tests, and these should be as deep as possible, as the uppermost layers of the Pars are probably all that are exposed. Under present conditions there would be great difficulty in obtaining water for the boiler ; possibly an internal combustion engine would have to be employed.

With reference to the second paragraph of your letter No. 7 E.

Kwwiiyt No. E. 0.-329-1, dated Moharnmerah the 4th February 1914. From—Messrs. The Anglo-Pers : an Oil Company, Ltd., To— J. G. LORIMER, Esq., C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persiaa Gulf, Bushire. We have the honour to enclose herewith a full estimate of the cost of in stalling a distilling plant of 100,000 gallons capacity at Kuwait. Water Distilling plant for Kuwait, The plant will be capable of distilling from sea water 450 tons of drinking water per twenty-four hours, this quantitv. roughly 100,000 gallons, will be netc gained distilled water, i.e., the plant will produce this amount and in addition enough to make up feed for boiler,—this is an important point as it enormously adds to the efficiency and life of plant. The plant offered is the most economical type which can be designed, giving 45-50 lbs. of water per pound of coal or 55-60 tons per ton of fuel oil consumed. This result would be a great deal increased by the addition of an economiser to the boiler plant. We would pomt out the extremely simple construction of the plant, the tubes bein 0 ' readily accessible botn above and b^low the tube plate, the former, being straight and of medium length, can be readily and quickly cleaned, more over as any one or more stills can be cut out of the series leaving remainder at work it will not be necessary at any time to shut down the plant for cleaning and scaling purposes; of course this improvement on the older type plants adds a little to the cost, but it can readily be seen that this extra 0 ^ tla y ^ r( ;Pf lc ! many times over in the first year's working. The boiler being fed with distil e water would not require cleaning, etc , more than once a year and then the whole iob could be completed in three days, even this could be obviated by fitting two boilers, but we hardly think the extra expense would be warranted. The buildings required for the complete plant would be, for the distilling olant 60 feet lonl 30 feet wide and 24 feet high, for the boiler and pumps feet long 20 teet wide, and 15 feet high, all measurements being inside, the buildings would occupy the position below ; 1) j) STILLS, ETC. BOILER, etc.i.. s * The buildings could be either of galvanized iron or mud brick T^o Pumps would be required besides the ordinary boiler feed pump-one .0 .eed stills and ^ one to feed storage tanks from stills ; for this purpose we propose a 5-,o h. p. 0 Oil engine belted lo two centrifugal pumps. The total working expenses per annum would amount to about eighty r thousand rupees on a twenty days per month basis, or a little more than halt a pice per gallon of water distilled. For Tanks we would suggest two fi f ty thousand ga lons tanks, thus enabling them to be cleaned in turn without interfering at all with the continuous working ot plant. We are assured this plant can be kept in continuous operation for 360 days per annum requiring one native engineer at about Rs. 75 and 4 coolies at Hs 13 per rrensem for the care cf same. We would tender for the same, and for the irstruction of the operators, on a time and material basis. Herewith we append an estimate of the cost of the plant completely erected. i 'j~ Buildings in galvanized iron erected Tanks in ste 1 ; with foundations erected and with cleaning connections ... ... ••• Boiler with brickwork, stack, etc. ... ••• ••• 95° _ Puinf s with engines, etc., erected ... ••• ••• 200 Still, condensers and platforms the.efor ... ••• 9,862 Piping to sea, and tanks with valves ... ... 5° IiiciJentaU ... ••• ••• l ^ 0 Total ... 12,312 The foregoing prices are based on the assumption that we can obtain coolies locallv at Krans two per diem, native bricks at rupees twenty-eight per thousand mud bricks at rupees two and a half per thousand and in quantity sudicient to keep the working going steadily. Our prices for pipes, etc., allow a maximum distance between sea and plant of one hundred and fiity yards, between plant and tanks fifty yards. 350 75^ No C 9, dated Kuwait, the 17th March J914' f r0 ni— Lifuff-nant Colonel VV. G. Grey, i.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, 1 have the honour to reply to your endorsement No. 594, dated 24th Feb ruary 1914, forwarding for an expression of my views an estimate of the cost of installing a water distilling plant at Kuwait. As you are aware ^ recently visited Mohammerah in order to discuss the matter with the Snai who was there, and with the Anglo Persian Oil Company's Engineer who was lesponsiblc for the preparation of the estimate. 2. 1 notice that the length of the plot of land required for the installation will be about fifty yards and its breadth some twelve yards. The site has no yet been decided upon owing to the Shaikh's continued absence from Kuwait, but he assures me that there will be no difficulty, in fact that he will probably be able to provide a piece of ground of the dimensions required in the centre 0 the town and on the sea shore. I have pointed out to him th.it such a position will be convenient for the majority of the purchasers of water, and will save expanse owing to its proximity to the sea. The exact site can be fixed later. 3. I have represented to the Engineer of the Oil Company that coolies cannot be procured in Kuwait at less than Rs. i-8 per diem, but as only about3 f ° r y r&gt;e ; cc ! ul f red thls wil1 not increase the estimate to any great extent Nat; / . cks, he informs me can be landed at Kuwait at Rs. 28 per thousand, ano cui have mud bricks made locally at a price very little exceeding that giv the estimate All things considered, the Engineer and I are of opinion tha n any case the initial expenditure will not exceed ;£ 12,500, at which sum it n y be fixed for present purposes. „ 1 he amount of water which it is suggested should be turned out is about iqc 00 gallons pei diem, or 25,000 kerosine oil tins full, a kerosine oil tin b^ing the Kuwait measure, for twenty days in the month, and the working expenses on this basis are given at about Rs. 80,000 per annum. At present water is brought to Kuwait in native boats each carrying some 1,000 tins, the number of such boats^ varying according to season and from other causes ; and in addition 18,000 tins are brought by the Shaikh's steamer once a fortnight. The daily sale is said to be about 8,000 tins in winter and 16,000 in summer, but in summer the demand greatly exceeds the supply and it is then that hard ship is felt. It would thus apparently be necessary during the hot weather to work the plant for more days in the month than are suggested in the estimate, but the number could be reduced during the cooler season and the yearly working expenditure remain about the same. The amount of water produced yearly at 25,000 tins per diem for twenty days in the month is slightly in excess of the estimated yearly demand. 5. The rate of sale per kerosine oil tin of water in Kuwait varies according to the season and the quantity available. In summer it is generally As. i*- and in winter has been as low as As. ^ per tin. Probably the best price for the Shaikh to fix at first would be As. i per tin from.November to April, and As. f per tin from May to October inclusive. This, presuming that the whole amount produced was sold, would give an average income of Rs. 15 ,625 per mensem. The amount of initial expenditure is estimated at Rs.. 1,87,500 and the average working expenses at about Rs. 6,650 per mensem. In the event of the initial expenses being advanced to the Shaikh he would be in a position to repay the amount in two years by monthly instalments giving an average of Rs. 8,000 ; he could also defray the monthly working expenditure, and retain for himself a small profit, all out of the income realised. After the initial expenditure had been repaid the price of w f ater could be reduced as considered advisable. 6. 1 have the honour to request that this scheme may now be submitted for the favourable consideration of the Government of India, who may be asked kindly to advance the initial expenses of the installation on the understanding that the amount is repayable in two years by monthly instalments giving an average of Rs. 8,000 per mensem ; repayment to commence from the date upon which the water-supply is realised. C^FD—44—Simlaf.a. y Following conmsnts occur 3 me on estimate:- \ ^ . Th^y . lo not, s^iy what increase, nor v/hat initial cost would 'be of Bconoroiser. (B). They do not say what reduction ite output occurs when one still is cut out, (C) Spare engine and pumps would 'be required. because (D) More than two tanks would be required the stills would yield hot water,! think,and one could not probably Tras sel' 1 hot water and anyway if one tank shut down for cleaning one would be up a hit of a tree. (2) Why give working expenses at 80 days a month and then -70 r&gt; say plant can :-\vcrth 330 days per annum and what is odd Kuwait to do on the xttoJx. 5 days. (F) Galvanised buildings would be perfect hell in hot waather Another point is quarters for staff etct or lodgings as a recurrent charge. We have already called Government^ attention to the press Mansfield water finder,but if we the point it means delay. This estimate may perhaps go on to India.

The Anglo Persian Oil Company nright be asked how they could arrange to keep the water fairly cool (when the condensers weee projected for Bushire, there was a getting an ice-making plant attached). 2. S.A's point (E) . Reason why working expenses at 20 days 'p.m. are given is because in our last letter to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the enclosure (5) we gave Aden figures on that basis. In ray opinion plant would sset want to^work on many more than 5 days each year. ^ 3. S.A's poin-t (F) .

On page 6 of ^ils (d) Captain S said Rs 2(approx)per 100 galloias were paid for river water. In that case condensed water would have to sell cheaper, especially in winter time when the denand is less* Let us say Rs 1-J- per 100 gallons. This would give, if all water were bought for 240 working days p.a. Rs r56 n ,000 whereas expenses as above for the 1st year would be Rs 300.000 However I do not think for the moment that 100.O00 gallons would]/ be bought each day on 240 days in the year. It is difficult to estimate the takings for the first year. 8* In any case, we now ha^e to send on to Govt of India, the A, P.0• C letter and I think, should ask them to reconsider uhsir opinion about boring in view of large expenditure on conden- sor-s, and in view of the points brought out in my note of Jan 19 of which they shouldbe warned. 9. I agree with S.A. that copies of correspoddence might ne sent to Sir P. Cox in London, and advantages urged oi experi- mental boring before oondensors are erected. As regards delay, Captain S's letter of Jan 18th says that 9 months would be re quired by'A.P.O.C. to get the condensers erected, and it will take Govt some time to sanction the money - so we have plenty of time!i H.G.C. &gt; This also might be pointed out to Govt in view of Shaikh's impatience.t/ (yfl.c. //f/ 29th rarch 1914.

The piping system would be fully equipped with valves, drains, vents &amp;c.. as required # to facilitate ease of working and cleaning.

(3) In our original estimate we gave the working ex penses per annum as RstSO.OOO or a little more than half a pice per gallon of water distilled, working on the basis of twenty working dapper month. This is based on figures that # we are assured by Suppliers, have been realized in actual working of these plants. Fiftyfive to sixty tons of water distilled per ton of oil fuel consumed, that is working on full load for twenty days, the plant could distil 6000 tons of water consuming 160 tons of oil value say Rs5000 or for twelve months Rs:60,000, fuel for small pump -ing engines would amount to about Rs:1500 per annum, lubricating oil about RslOOO, repairs and overhauls &amp;c., say Rs;4500.

He is not able to oritioise the details of the estimate whioh have been placed before him but accepts them generally. He unders- -tands the scheme of repayment, rate of sale of water, etc pre- —pared by me and thoroughly agrees with it. Prom a larger experience of Kuwait including part of the hot weather^however, I am not sure that the sale of water has not been over estimated, and, to be on the safe side, would asu that an average rate of fis.6 ,000/- per mensem may be aojepted by Government for repayment on the understanding that the aver- -age of Bs.8,000/- at first proposed will be adhered to if ■possible.

From what Howell tells me, here is little doubt but that ' Shaikh Salim and Co. will accept the terms we have put forward. So far as one can judge, and after making ample allowances for all cbsts — fuel oil and administration generally—the plant should run to an annual profit of close upon 100%, possibly more, though it is the intention to indicate at present only round about 60%, so as to avoid the possibility of the Shaikh being disappointed with eventual results.

Memorandum relative to the erection and f hon plant ecrected by Messrs. Striek Scott and Company LLTZ.T rmnt with His Excellency the late Shaikh Contract.—Messrs. Striok Scott and Company, Limited, entered into agreement* *c/. enclosure i of Serial No. (10). ^ 1 '' of Kuwait in May 1915, under date of 15th May 1915, is attached fOTiSormation!^ 1 ^ COntract, conclude( l Plant. The plant is designed to out-turn 400 tons of distilled water daily and erection was completed in March 1918. Most unfortunately, however it has not heen possible to start running the plant owing to the Shaikhs fail'ure to anange an efficient transport service for conveyance of the necessary fuel oil from Abadan to Kuwait. ^ In brief, the Shaikh s proposal to import his fuel oil requirements by means of water boats (native craft) has proved wholly inadequate. In parenthises we desire to place on record that the Shaikh has been continually warned to make proper arrangements to meet his liability in this respect, so that the water plant might be started up and run without interruption from the date of its completion. Management of the water distillation plant. —As a direct result of his inability to organise or maintain transport of fuel oil for the plant. Shaikh Salim approached the Political Department in Basrah for advice and assistance, submitting a pro posal that Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, might be addressed with a view to their taking over the management and running of the plant, upon terms to be agreed. &amp; ^ ^ In response to the Shaikh's suggestion. Colonel Howell very kindly represented to him the position in which this Company is situated, viz-a-vis the contract, and explained that, owing to war conditions very heavy additional expense had been incurred, in excess cost of materials, enhanced freight, etc., etc., resulting in a dead loss to the Company of some £3,000. It is to be noted, moreover that, as from March 1918 (when the plant was completed) certain expenditure still continued to acrue, for which, in the circumstances above noted, the contractors cannot be held responsible. Proposed terms of management by Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited.— Colonel Howell thereupon placed before the Shaikh (as a basis for representation of the latter's proposal to Messrs. StrickScott and Company, Limited) that the Company should be allotted an interest in the water distillation concern, commensurate with actual loss on the contract sustained by them. With this the Shaikh expressed his agreement in general. Thereafter Mr. Walpole called upon Colonel Howell to discuss further details of terms upon which Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, might be prepared to undertake management of the distillation plant, and here we outline what it is considered would be terms acceptable to the Company's Directors. [а] That a limited liability company should be formed, in which Messrs- Strick Scott and Company, Li ited, should be allotted shares to the extent of loss sustained by tnem on the contract for erection of the plant, Strick Scott and Company, Limited, being liable ior no pay ment whatsoever for such shareholding acquired. (б) That Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, should be appointed managing agents of the said company, receiving all administration expenses and an adequate commission, to be arranged. (c) That Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, should have financial control of the said company, appoint their own manager, engage an control all staff and Ubour, and generally control the plant and sale of its production.4 The above has been conveyed to'our Directors for their consideration, and their reply will be communicated upon receipt.

L och , Political Agent, Kuwait, m To—The Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah T enclose a copy of a revised draft for an agreement between the Shaikh and Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, regarding the water plant. The points of material difference in the first three paragraphs are italicised, parag: ph IV is entirely reconstructed and the remaining paragraphs are new. Paragraph III of the original draft would appear from the wording ' erect within my territories ' to confer a very wide monopoly which might prove inconvei ient if, for instance, a port were to be established at Kadhamah. As altered, the interests of the Company are safeguarded in the town of Kuwait, which is presumably the object of their paragraph. I think that it would be inadvisable to form a limited liability company re gistered in India, as seems to have been contemplated in paragraph IV of the original ■' aft, no Indian court has any jurisdiction here and Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, being a British Company, will in any case receive all the assistance which it is possible and proper for Government to give, while the troubles and delays of possible litigation in an Indian court would be avoided. I think that we should insist on some guarantees, such as those in paragraphs V, VI, and VII of the revised draft, being given as I hardly think that the Shaikhs interests have been sufficiently safeguarded in the past, considering that he relied on us for guidance in a matter in which he was quite unable to judge for himself. I un- deistand that technically the Shaikh may have no cause for complaint, but it is much to be regretted that at the beginning the tender was not framed to include everything in any way necessary for the successful operation of the plant and 1 fear that any further call for capital for omitted items would cause the Shaikh and others concerned seriously to question our good faith and that of the firm. A copy of the revised draft has been given to Mr, Mr. Herring for transmission to his firm and i send this in case you may wish to discuss the matter further with them.

(II) Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Limited, shall be appointed the managers of the water plant, and they undertake to maintain it always in good running order to the best of their ability. For their services in this connection Messrs.

Salts are present to an unpleasant degree and there is* noticeable discolouration with iron. When the water has become quite cool it it even more unpalatable than when drawn lukewarm fromthe tank. In ouroninmn Shaikh Salim should not be asked to accept this water. Ends. Shaikh states according to original contract and specification, plant is supposed to turn out 400 tons water in 24 hours and under new arrangements 250 tons in 12 hours. That until it is shown that plant is capable of turning out stipulated quantity and quality of water is improved he will not take it over and holds you responsible for all expenditure incurred from 4th. Addressed Strick, Mohammerah, repeated Political, Baghdad. Translatmi of a letter dated the el-Mubarak-es-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kv.waif, Enclosure 8. The contract* regarding the water plant was made between my father and * Cf. enclosure i of Serial No. (10). Messrs. Strick Scott and Company on 15th ^iay 1915 when Colonel Grey was.Political Agent, and correspondence subsequently passed between us and Colonel Hamilton regarding the fuel oil tank and with Captain Loch about the pipes. We are aware that you know all about this. For the sake of Colonel Hamilton and Captain Loch w e agreed to pay the cost of the fuel oil tank £1,530, and £125 of the pipes in addi tion to the cost of the plant mentioned in the contract. All this time the plant was incomplete and work was delayed for reasons unknown to us. Afterwards they claimed through Captain McCollum Rs. 47,000 which they said they were losing. Correspondence was carried on m connection with this with Captain McCollum and we received a letter from him to say that the Civil Commissioner and Deputy Civil Commissioner wished that Messrs. Strick Scott and Company should be given shares in the plant to the extent of the amount which they said that they were losing. Since this was the desire of the Civil Commissioner and Deputy Civil Commissioner we agreed to it but Messrs. Strick Scott and Com pany declined to take the shares and claimed Rs. 75,000 for expenses over and above the amounts mentioned above. We were much surprised at this and knew that the matter could not be settled without the intervention of the High Gov ernment and we therefore asked Captain McCollum, who informed us that he had consulted the Civil Commissioner and that he (Civil Commissioner) had replied that he had not an army of engineers. We said that we were sure that Govern ment did not wish that we should suffer loss on every side. He replied that Gov ernment wanted that the plant should commence work as soon as possible when we said that we were also anxious to see this done but that we did not see a true word from Messrs. Strick Scott and Company for every time they claimed something and what reason had they to claim the expenses of Rs. 75,000 from us. Government did not surely wish to make us bear their loss. The last word that Captain McCollum said to us was that this loss was caused by the war and that Government wished to help them (Strick Scott and Company) and that we also would not lose as the plant would give us good profit. r lhat he could get details of quantity of water the plant would produce and the amount of daily, monthly, and yearly expenditure that would require to run the plant. He brought these particulars which were as follows :— The plant would make 250 tons sweet water every day in 12 hours, the selling price to be one anna per tin, the wages of engineer, workmen and other expenses to be as explained by him ; that Messrs.

This is without reason and for no semce whatever. For the sake of Government we paid the amount to - L j - =. .-tnck Scott and Companv and we are sure that they know all this. Vow the co^t of the plant amounted toRs. 2.82.740 excluding the expenses paid by us in Kuwait which are about Rs. 30.000. Before Captain McCollumleft Kuwait the plant worked for one day and the water which was made wa s bracbsh. We pointed out this to him and enquired how he wa. leaving without set nng the matter as we were afraid that Messrs. Strick Scott and Company might not carry out the conditions of the agreement and fresh dispute arising thereby. He said he wanted to see the matter properly settled but that he was sorry that he cou.d not as he had delav received telegram from Colonel W ilson to be present at Basrah on the 7th June and that we should have patience for 2 or 3 days when if the water was not still sweet we could inform the Political Agent here who would inform km telegraphicallv at Basrah and he would inform the Civil Commissioner. Bagudad. The plant worked dav and night from Wednesday (4th June) to Monday (9th June) and within this period did not make more than 400 tons salty water For cleanncr doubts we invited Dr. Mylrea and the ;; Qass (Reverend Calverley) and some of our leading men to taste the water and they pronoimced that it was salty. We therefore submit the matter as it stands from the beginning to the end so that vou mav inform the Civil Commissioner what has happened. W e ^ ia ^ e lost a big amount on the plant and still it is not working. e do not accept the plant if ft cannot make 400 tons sweet water every 24 hours or 250 tons in 12 hour. We request the High Government to look into this matter with merciful eyes and request vou to inform Messrs. Strick Scott and Company that we are not responsible for the wages of engineer and workmen, etc.. whether thay stay here or lea\e for Mohammerah. The responsibility of the plant is on them.

The whole staff have been ill through lack of proper accommodation, and he feels sure Your Excellency will agree that it is not right or feeling that men should be expected to live in a building where work is continu ing night and day, especially in an iron building with a temperature of 140.

We are really very sorry for this kind of treatment. How are they right in pxnenses and commission when the plant, as you know, is not successful ™ kmg) aSmg to contract. We cleared all accounts with them to the end of ^ B/ May 1919 and paid, through Captain ' fC/. enclosures 3—6 of Pro. No. 510 in S. W., McCollum, R?. 132,740t which is the September 1919, Nos. 453—512. total amount they claimed rightfully or not ? We were not to pay this amount before the completion of the plant according to the agreement^ but we did so because ^Enclosure 2 in ibid. Captain McCollum had agreed to pay it and also because we wanted to please the High Government and this was on the under standing that the plant was properly completed and ready for running continuously in good order and to turn 250 tons of sweet and clean water every 12 hours as per details which Captain McCollum gave us. After they had received the amount from us they had no connection (interest) in the plant. ' They worked the plant for us six days and nights and the plant did not work satisfactorily, and as required by the agreement. At this time we informed you and gave full details regarding the plant from beginning to end „ , o ^ ^a- -t-j in our letter.S dated 11th Ramadhan 1337 ^Enclosure 8 of Pro. No. 510 in ibid. t j , i * (lOtli June 1919), and you must nave communicated the same to the Government r.nd Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, (in spite of this) what right have they now to claim anything for April and May when we had squared all their accounts to the end of May 1919 and they had no connection whatsoever with the plant ? But Messrs. Strick Scott and Company do tilings carelessly and not in accordance with agreement. To tell the truth we have got nothing from this Company but troubles and much correspondence without any benefit. I request you to carefully consider this matter and to again submit it to the High Government so that the High Government may know the kind of treatment we receive, and you may make a suitable arrangement which will stop Messrs. Strick Scott and Company from giving such treatment which is against right and inform them that we absolutely refuse to pay a single rupee more and that we want from them the plant properly completed according to the agreement. We paid Messrs. Strick Scott and Company Rs. 20,415 for 300 tons of fuel oil and they have expended a quantity of it without benefit to us. They have no right to this but they have burned it without any agreement or permission from us and we want it back. I am sure that the just Government will not approve this kind of treatment and will not agree to things which are against justice and right. Enclosure 7.

We can only reiterate Captain Wardle's statement that the completion of the well is of the utmost necessity to the continuous running of the Plant. His Excellency the Shaikh's attitude is placing grave difficulties in our way in correcting the deficiencies in 1?he plant. His Excellency the Shaikh further affirms that Captain Wardle's request for accommodation for the water plaDt staff was met with Yusuf Mutuwah's house.

I think however, that he is quite hopeful of getting it to go eventu ally. At present they are still having to stop every two or three hours to tighten up joints and make minor alterations, and so far the best they have done is to makQ about 3o tons of water in four hours, but that is not really so little as it appears,as they started with cold boilers, and the water is good. They ought to have a much better chance this time having a man like Campbell here, as he can make alterations on his own, and is not tied to the drawings like an 'erector' is, I will keep you posted as to how things progress, 'cruw ztvuitwa /'• ^ -■ V! 0.

The formation of scale was -p &lt; scale was, of course, foreseen and they have a scale-borer for removlns it hrt a !&gt; moving it, but, according to Oampbell, the chemical engineer sent out by the makers th« ! sea water here is peculiarly dense and forms an exceptionally hard scale, which cannot be removed fast enough with the existing borer to allow the plant to make its fun amount of water. He thinks - and Sardle (Strick, Scott 4 Go's man)agrees with him - that a more efficient scale-borer could be found ! which would get over La* truuoife, but this could only be got from Hoae which would probably mean at least three months delay 1 Wardle has apparently no intention of taking o^er the Plant from the makers until it is right, and, until Strick, : Scott take it over, there can be no question of the Shaikh f being asked to do so, ^ If the London people can find an instruiaent which J! &gt; \ / -♦V. difficulty it might be poBsme to run the will get over the di.fioux y, ^ ^ it make wnat wd/uei Plant in the mean while an - tnr, t na a . fnr a m i nu te think would be )00 tons sell which I &lt;3-0 not for &gt; , k 0 - m 9-w there would be not the day, as both VfardlQ and Campbell y least trouole in mating considerably more I think the Shaikh would ag^ee to an arrangement of this sort, provided he sees that it does not bind him to over the Plant if it still will not fulfil the conditions o the contract with the new borer; whereas, if the place to be shut up again and everyone go away, as has happed ao often before, I am quite sure he demand hia money back from Strick, Scott - I know I would, if I 'ere in hla place.

Meanwhile he is going on cleaning them witn the hammer arrangement, but he can only do about ten a day, so it will take weeks before he is through at that tate.

The business part of the instrument at the end of the flexible tube consists of a steel cylinder about five inches long which just goes comfortably inside'the bore of the tube. It has two ports through which the compressed air passes alternately thus driving a hammer which projects through it against the sides of the tube. This has ^roved a failure for thick, hard scale .xhe reason apparently is that the hammer is supposed to striKe the tube just above the scale, and not the scale itself; but, with very thick scale like this y it is almost impossible to prevent the nose of the hammer from getting into the scale. This prevents the hammer from getting in its full stroke^ but sends it back into the central position where it stops, as the air is then passing through both ports at once. Once it stops it cannot be started again without pulling it to the top of the tube. But for that, it is a beautifully handy tool, and t although it is useless for old thick scale, Campbell thinks it may work all right with a thin coating of newly formed scale. The other is a i h.p, motor mounted on a trolley for pulling it along the platform. It has a flexible shaft to pass inside the pan, which is connected to a rod which passes down the tubes, Campbell has not yet tried this, as he does not know much about electricity and is waiting till Strick, Scott's man, Hughes, comes dowai - he expects him to-morrow. He says, however, he is pretty sure it will remove any scale, but he does not like it as an Instrument as it is so heavy and unwieldy to work. He thinks it is more suited for removing very bad old scale than for ordinary routine cleaning work. On the whole he feels fairly satisfied that he will be able to keep the tubes clean once they are thoroughly clean - all are done now except a few which he is going to try the motor on. He hopes to run a six days test about the i9th October, and I fancy this will be the final one one way or the other,He does not aeem so optiaiatic now as he did, and, as far as I can see, the chances are about even that he will make the 400 tone, but against his making the 450. - ^ ^D.O.

This time they are only going to use five out of the six pans, and cut out the first and second on alternate days for cleaning, these two being the ones whicii scale so badly. If, therefore, tiiey make the 450 tons at all, the third day ^ill be the interesting one, as one will then be able to see whether they Jean, or can nol^get off a day's scaling in a day.

They started again on Wednesday morning, and filled the first tank (225 tons) in Just under twelve hours. During the night, however, the pans primed over and a lot of salt water got into the second tank and made it quite undrinkable so they closed down again yesterday morning. THE reason why it was so difficult to prevent this priming was that the sight glasses got covered over hy a film of scale which made it impossible to see the height of the water inside the pans, Campbell is now fixing, up an arrange ment for blowing steam onto the inside of these glasses when they get dirty. He says he has done this on other plants and found it clean t ,hem all right, so anticipates no further trouble in this respect. He hopes to start up again tomorrow. On the whole the teat was rather satisfactory, as while it worked the Plant made water at the rate of over 450 tons - although only just over - and, what is still more important, the scale formed on the tubes now that they are clean is Just like powder, and perfectly easy to clean off.

He told Hughes, Stick, Scott &amp; Go 's man, that he wished to run another test. Hughes, after wiring to Muhammarah, told him that his 3 firm considered the last test as final, but that there was no objection to hie trying another on his own responsibility if he cared to, and that, if he did, he would give him any help he could, V 0 * in the mean wliiXe, CaiapbeH had. h«*.cl a l)rain wave as to what might be causing the priming.
