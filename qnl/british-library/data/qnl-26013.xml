EGYP T. SECTION I. G-OVIimSNT - AD/IINI STRATI ON. 1. The Air Traffic control section of the Egyptian civil Aviation Department has issued Notice to Airmen no, 13a/1947 giving details of aeronautical telecommunication service for civil aviation in Egyot under the following headings (a) Cairo plight information Region, (b) Cairo control Area, (c) Cairo Approach control, (d) parouk Airport Control, (e) A.lmL.za Airport Control, (p) Alexandria Airport, (g) Luxor Airport, (h) Mersa Matruh Airport, ( 1 ) port said Airport, (j) mb aba Ai3j)ort, (k) Minia Airport, (l) Assiut Airport. As forecast in EGYPT section I paragraph 4 of last month’s Newsletter, the five British Air Traffic control oiTicers at present on loan to the Egyptians are no:/ being withdrawn upon termination of their six months’ agreement. All five officers are ejected to have lef u lor the united Kingdom by the end of pebruary depending on the following; The Egyptians have asked that three officers should be allowed to remain for a further period of two months as instructors to their new plying control school, by which time the first course at presenc being undertaken at the school will be completed. They have been informed tnat this could only be done at the Egyptian Government’s expense. The Egyptians state that financial approval for such an arrangement would be extremely difficult to obtain. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has again been approached by this, ;ind decision is in the meantime pending. 5* The Egyptians have a serious shortage of meteorological forecasters until the end of 1948? and hove asked that the British offer of the loan of two forecasters should bo increased to four for a period of eight months. pour met forecasters will be required to operate the Mot. station to bo set up at uo.riut (peuad 1 ) Airport. por further information ploo.se refer to Aerodromes section. The combined Amcrican-pgyptian met. service at parouk and Alniaza is adequately meeting all requirements in that areo.. 4* The Egyptian Civil Aviation Department have requested permission to send two civil Engineers to the united Kingdom to acquire knowledge and experience in aerodrome construction. ,b. A. machine for testing bearing strengths of airfields lias recently been designed in the united Kingdom, and constructed of light alloy components suitable for breakdown for air transportation. Experts believe that it is only by the use of this equipment that accurate calculation can be ma.de of load-carrying capacity of any given runway. The first machine is now ready and the Ain Ministry propose to use it initially to test airfields in the Middle East. The Egyptian Ministry of porcign Affairs ha.s been a.pproa.ched for permission to try out this equipment on Almaza. and parouk airfields, a nd it is later hoped to test Basra (Margil) Airport. The machine is expected to bo available for test of Almaza o.nd parouk towards the end of February, and in the meantime Egyptian approval is awaited*CONFIDENTIAL. EGYPT - SECTION I - GOVERNvlENT IUCTflSTmTON - Pm&amp;IVm 6. 6 . AERODRqSS PO LICY. (a) Yfe understand that the Egy^otian government' s policy is now to build up parouk Airport and not Almasa as the future international Airport of Egypt. This decision has 10011 taken because : - (i) The majority of foreign operators have expressed a preference for parouk from the technical aspect; K. L.M., Air prance and SABENA in addition to T.W.A., panair de Brazil and Scandinavian Airlines are among such operators, although K.L.M. are still operating from lydda. (ii) parouk is loss congested with aircraft operated by numerous local companies, charter firm: etc. (iii) The Heliopolis Oasis company housing estate programme is beginning to interfere with the approaches to Almaza, and the government has no powers to stop this. (iv) The Heliopolis oasis company arc about to embark on the construction of a model village called Aeropolis situated near parouk. This would, of course, solve one of the problems connected with the use of the airport. (b) The Government has agreed on a five year construction plan, at the end of which time, parouk: will emerge as an I.C.A. 0. class n B' aerodrome. in addition a teminal building will be constructed exactly similar to that designed for Almaza in 1944 , but which was never built. This building would provide a certain amount of accommodation for night stopping passengers and crews, and obviate the necessity for operating companies transporting their -passengers into Heliopolis or C^-iro. (c) phase one of the construction programme is to be the construction of a completely new runway to the I.C.A.O. specification for a class 'B' blind landing runway. The present main runway is not considered to be sufficiently into the prevailing wind, and there would be difficulties in extending it for technical reasons, principally the gradient trouble. All other runways are to be lengthened and strengthened. The bearing strength is to be 'in excess of 12 o, 000 “lbs'. (d) phase two - probably early 1950 - is to be the construction of the terminal building in which will bo contained the Gust errs, immigration and Quarantine Sections, Area and Tower control, Mot. etc. As mentioned in section n para. 1 below, a sum of LE. 200,000 has boon granted for this year plus an additional IE. 12,000 Dor making small improvements to the existing easterns and Quar ntinc Departments as a temporary measure. (e) Almaza is to remain as a civil airport for use by the local companies, and for non-scheduled operators. The Royal Egyptian Air Force will also remain there. smbaba will be used by plying clubs and Schools. (f) is probable tint sometime within the next five years B.O.A.C. will have to move frern Almaza to parouk. The future possible disposal of B.O.A.C. - owned buildings and installations at Alniaza will therefore have to be considered. • SECTION II. AERODROMES. 1. FAROUK. (a) it was reported in LE PROG-RES EGYPTIEN of 15 th January 1948 that a credit of LE.2oo&gt;000 had ‘boon allocated for improvements to parouk Airport. (b) ¥e understand that the new area control lay-out at parouk (in place of Almaza) is quite satisfactory from a technical, point of view, and given well-qualified control staff should be adequate for the provision of I.C.A.O. Standards/ SECTION II, paragraph 1(b)/- 3 - CONFIDENTIAL. miPT - SECTION II - i’luRODHQviES - parci[;raph I(L otanclArcla of -;ror. centrol 3or\'iccn, The present Egyptian control staff - duo to various causes, one 'being undorpayrsont - are not over enthusiastic, and in addition the majority have a very limited knowledge of English. (c) search and rescue facilities - as mentioned last month - arc almost entirely dependant upon the cooperation of the R.A.F. control Centre at Fey id, with whom the -oroblem of rapid communication is a pressing one. pt is understood that a continuous w/T watch may soon he opened for S.A.R. purposes on 842o Kcs. het\;ecn the Area control Centre parouk, and the S.A.R. Centre payid. (d) pe date c:cperience has shaven the meteorological services at parouk to he superior 'bo those formerly available at / L lmasa. 2 . AmAEA. (a) The mobile lighting equipment for this airport has now been made available by the R.A.F. (b) The BASS Mark II equipment still awaits customs clearance at port said. (c) The Almaza tower radio, aftor many complaints, has no;? been roplacod by American equipment, raid results have greatly improved* B.O.A.C. are maintaining the new set. (d) 'gc understand that the Air Traffic control school was transferred from parouk to ;JLmasa during December because the Egyptians have rented the premises to T.Y/.A. for something over £E2 per day. T.f.f. arc to use these premises for tho training of their own pilots. 3. IvARIlIT (FQUAD EL ; y.AL) Sea-port Aerodrome. (a) Mariui is in future to ‘be Imown by the name of pouad el jtwil (pouad the pirst) sea-port aerodrome. (b) Representatives of this office, U.K.C.A.T.R. and B.O.A.C. Middle past Eegional Hoadauarters recently attended a meeting held in the office of the Egypt: an Tjndor Secretary of state for Air for the purpose of discussing; tho question of tho opening of this aerodrome. Another moctii: ; \ic.i subsequently held at Rod-ol-parag as a result of which the B.O.A.C. ejeperts recommended minimum requirements for pouad el gwal which were provisionally agreed to by the Egyptian Roprosenv.ative. The recommendations covered requirements for th^.- Marine Section’s equipment and personnel; air traffic control; flare pash; and the training of controllers and marine staff by B.O.A.C. The Egyptians have been informed that all equipment necessary for the implementation of the recommended requirements, together with certain radio facilities, could be loaned them from the existing equipment at Rod-el-parag. This lean w r ould, of course, bo on a financial basis, and the Egyptian reaction has not yot been received. it was agreed at the first meeting referred to above that it should be possible to transfer traffic from Rod-ol-parag to pouad I during April 1948. Details of landing and ascending directions, buoyage and lighting were also discussed. Tho Egyptians anticipate difficulty in opening the Meteorological station at pound I - which B.O.A.C. have stated to bo necessary to them for their operations there - owing to the lack of trained meteorologists, tho number required to open the Station being at least four. should it bo impossible to open tho Station for this reason, B.O.A.C. would have SECTION II, to/........... paragraph 3 (b)/.- 4 “ SECTION III, paragraph 1 A* No. 4 Line/, COI'IFI DENTlALc EG1TT - SECTION II, AERODROMES - 3(E N to rcplj^ - on met, observations -from Elmaza or parouk, and it vvas agreed at the Meeting to install a teleprinter and telephone line between pouad I and Almo.za/parouk for this purpose.

A vote of LS.25,000 has been made to cover preliminary expenses of the work which is to start immediately. The existing sir /iEid at Ras-el-Bar is for summer use only, and flooded in the winter. 6 .

B.O.f.C. have had to divert their trunk route cairo-Basra to the north as a result of Fgyptian Notice to Airmen 12A/1947 defining a prohibited area circulating El Arish. The diversion involves an additional 29 nautical miles and 13 gallons of extra fuel, it is'hoped that the Egrptian Army may consider reducing the prohibited area radius from 25 to IQ miles. C. Financial authority for B.O.A.C. Middle East unscheduled flights is in future to be granted by the Ministry of civil Aviation and not locally by this office. Similarly B.O.A.C. cannot in future ley on an extra aircraft for any special flight ■'without the prior approval of the Ministry.

They shall be kept under observation until completion of a bacteriological .examination, and thereafter shall stand under surveillance during not more than five days. The quarantine authority may, however, at his discretion grant such exemptions from these ruJ.es as he may think fit. Such exemptions should be granted inter alia: (a) Passengers who have left an infected area five months before their arrival in Ethiopia. (b) Passengers coming from non-infcctod area in transit through infected area should only be subjected to five days surveillance, provided they possess a valid anti-cholcra vaccination certificate and have not stayed in the infected area longer than t^o days. (c) If, in any aeroplane, one or several passengers coming from non-infected area, such co-pe.ssengcrs would be subjected to surveillance during five days or let free provided that no symptoms of cholera are observed in the aeroplane. 3 .

ETHIOPIA, paragraph 3(b)/....» •••• .*(b) Referring to Ethiopia paragraph iCb) of last month’s Newsletter, the Sudan G-ovemment has granted. E.A.L- Freedoms 1 to 4 at Ganibcila and Malakal for a once ■'weekly Addis Ataha-jimma. -Gambeila-Malakal service, and the Ethiopian government have agreed to grant Sudan Air./ays reciprocal riglits. E.A.L. made a preliminary survey flight along this route on 8 th January. The first scheduled service was to have ‘been flown on 19th January and thereafter ev..ry Monday following, hut due to Ethiopian custans complications the service has not yet started. The difficulty is that the Ethiopian officials cannot clear the aircraft returning to Ethiopia at Gambeila, since the airfield is in the Enclave, and there is nobody competent to do so at either G-ore or jimma. This difficulty is now under discussion. As regards the payment oi Sudan customs dues, E.A.L. have discussed this question at Malakal and hope to establish a customs post there which should obviate the difficulty, since they do not anticipate that any dutiable freight or baggage would normally be discharged at Gambeila. E.A.L* have decided to land at G-ambeila on oh flight, and not only during the dry season as was hitherto intended; this change of plan is due to customs and immigration requirements. The Sudanese welcome the scheduled stop at Gambeila, since it provides regular communication between Gambeila and Malakal, which is the main attraction to the Sudanese on this route. The service will be operated with 0*47 Dakotas. 6 .

The^servmg Officers are only available during the afternoons as their Air Force duties occupy the memings. They do not hold any instructors’ licences, but have had considerable experience instructing m the Air Force. With the eight serviceable aircraft they could no doubt train a large number of pilots, but at wresent only about six Persians are under training. A small number of oast -pupils who have gone sol'o, occasionally fly as well. * (e) Training is based on I.G.A.O. Private Pilot Licence requirements. A1-enough adequate Club premises are available, owing to lack of fundo cneoc nave oeen closed for some time, and theoretical subjects are supposed to be taught at the Club’s offices in Teheran.

The Director of Civil Aviation Aden recently interviewed Mr. N.R. Pearce in connection -.dth the latter’s projected intention to establish an air-•char ter cono^iy at Aden operating with C.i^ aircraft. Mr, Pearce's present object-is to discover on 'hat conditions such a cairpany could be granted landing and operating rights in Aden. Details of his proposals have bee: submitted to the Foreign Office, and the official attitude towards Mr. Pearce’s project is therefore a.s yet still undocidod, D tails of the 'project' are as follows:~ MIDDLE EAST GENEP.y^/iOrN/lViRAT.RAPH 5(i)CQI^TBMTIAL, “ 2 $ - MIDDLE EAST G -E]NOBRAL/ADEN/PA RAGrRAPH 5 (i ).. (i) Mr. IV..R. Pearce is an American employed by Ethiopian Airlines, and an ex. V. .A. employee. Associated with him in the project is another E.A.L. ex. T.'.'.A. employee named John H. Russell, aho is at present said to be in the United States collating aircraft statistics and other relevant data. (ii) The project contemplates operating -nth Curtiss Commando’s bought from United States surplus military stocks, incorporating, inter alia, modifications to hydraulic and fuel tanks systems designed to reduce air-risks. The plan is to bring in two of these aircraft at the outset, eventually increasing the fleet to fi^o. Y/ayfarers would^nntually replace the OJJR s„ (iii) The main object of the Company initially would be freight on the Addis Ababa/Aden route. The Company wcild also be interested in charter freight operations to Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, East Afrida, Sa’udi Arabia and India, but would not be interested in '-assengers except during the pilgrimage season. (iv) The Company would not be American controlled in any way* The pilots and ground staff would bo international. Mr. Pearoe was informed by the D.C.A. that any traffic right in Aden could only be granted to a British controlled company. If Pearce’s Company would be registered and capitalised in Aden then this pre-requisite would be fulfilled. ' Mr. Pearce was also informed that the volume of traffic on erry particular route- he contemplated operating should be such that duplication of already existing services was economically justifiable. Taking into consideration the fact that the Pearce project is aiming to freight hitherto untouched air-cargo, this condition would' also appear to be fulfilled. (v) The currency position, the suopiy of spare parts, and the servicing of the aircraft was also discussed by Mr. Pearce and the D • C. A. (vi) The R.A.P. have stated that they do not object to Pearce’s scheme. QUALIFIED OBSERVERS IN THE MID DLE EAST - '(Ministry of Civil Aviation Notice to Airmen No, 374/1947)* 6 .

The Air Traffic Control Section of the Civil Aviation Department has recently issued NOTICE TO AIRMEN No. 10A/1947, drawing the attention of Pilots, Aircraft Operating Companies and all concerned to the Ministry of Public Health Ministerial Arreto of 9th, July 1947 , deciding the following:- '(A) All aircraft coming from V/estern or Northern Africa, from areas considered by the Ministry of Public Health as yellow fever infected areas, must make their first landing at Mersa Matruh Aerodrome, before proceeding further to internal Aerodromes. (B) If - on account of bad weather or insufficiency of the equipment of the aerodrome for the reception of aircraft - aircraft cannot alight at Mersa Matruh they will have to proceed to Cairo aerodromes direct. In that case the pilot will have to disinsectise the aircraft while in flight by his own men by means of one of the approved pyrethrum solutions, before the arrival at Cairo. He will also have to advise the Aerodrome Authorities thereof before the opening of the aircraft. (C) Aircraft coming from one of the areas considered by the Ministry of public Health as yellow fever infected or alighting in such an area on their way to Egypt, will be disinsectisod at their arrival in the first Aerodrome in Egypt by a disinsectising solution.^ In this NOTICE TO AIRMEN attention is also drawn to various regulations regarding Pilgrims travelling by air. 2. The Air Navigation and Aerodromes Section of the Civil Aviation Department has recently issued NOTICE TO AIRMEN No. 11A/1947, in which 'it is desired to bring to the notice of Airmen and all concerned that a new Government Aerodrome will be opened at Embaba as from 1st December 1947, and will be available for the use of all Flying Schools, training purposes, clubs and private aircraft.

NOTICE TO ibEH'-IEN No. 12A/1947 the part text of which is as follows has also recently been issued by the Civil Aviation Department: 'It is hereby notified that with effect from 0400 G.ii.T. on Sundg^r 28th December, air firing practice will talce place in the circular area the centre of the area being El Arish Aerodrome .... Anti-aircraft fire and air firing- practice will be continuous night and day, and aircraft must avoid flyirg over this area. Aircraft not adhering to this warning will bo exposed to imminent danger with no previous warning”. The prohibited area is on B.O.A.C. and other Airlines' trunk routes to the Far East. The Director General Civil Aviation Department states that the Notice was issued (at 24 hours' notice) upon the request of the Egyptian military authorities, who are now being approached for a modification. 4. The Civil Aviation Department have requested permission to send four more Flying Control Officers to tire Flying Control School at Watchfield, England, for training. The Civil Aviation Department has been informed that this course is nor/ undertaken by Airways Training Limited, the cost of the twelve week course being £120, and that the ministry of Civil Aviation regrets that they are no longer able to offer free training to Egyptian Controllers. Under these circumstances the Civil Aviation Department are seeking- financial approval, which ..ay or may not be granted. In the meantime it is expected that the five British Air Traffic Control Officers at present on loan to the Egyptians will be withdrawn very shortly, thus terminating gratuitous air traffic control in Egypt. How the Egyptians -will progress in this respect - when left to their ov/n devices - remains to be seen. (For further information upon this subject see Section II, Aerodromes). 5• I.C.- x.O. G ENEVA COtrdIRSNCE - m eeti ng of the multilateral Agreement Committee. At this meeting a form of Multilateral Agreement acceptable' to all Contracting- States T/as not concluded, and individual States will therefore have to continue - as heretofore - to negotiate all commercial rights on a bilateral basis. Tnc negotiations for an Anglo-Egyptian Bilateral Agreement have, of course, yet to take place. EGYPT. SECTION II. PARA. 1/CO^FIDIirlT'LJL. G Y P T SECTION II, iiEI^ODROI.ES. 1. A U. 1 AZA . It is reported by the Senior Ministry of Civil Aviation Air Traffic Control Liaison Officer that a considerable improvement has taken place recently in the standard of maintenance of the equipment at Almaza, largely as a result the efforts of the Airport Superintendent. Local control has reached a reasonable standard of efficiency unler R.E.A.F, Officers, all of whom have practical flying experience. The V.H.F. radio has a very poor record of reliability and requires constant servicing by B.O.A.C. mechanics, but .nay be replaced by an American set in the near future. The watch on 61+1+0 Xcs. functions reasonably well but with very limited range. The met. services arc rather below standard. The embryo Egyptian Air Traffic Control School is now to be transferred to Almaza from Farouk, The site chosen for the School at Farouk was a former American Link Trainer Room - an air conditioned building- admirably suited for the purpose. v7hy the School is being transferred is not known. Lectures and practical instruction are to be given by Officers of the Egyptian Ministry of National Defence and the R.E.A.F. Captain RAFFA, recently trained in the U.K. in British control procedures will be in charge of the School, and also of the Area Control Centre mentioned below. 2. FARQUIC . Y/ork is progressing on the preliminary organisation of the new Area Control Centro here which is to be transferred from Almaza to Farouk on 1st January. From 1st January a short range aircraft guard will operate from Farouk and a listening watch only be maintained at Almaza. It has been arranged - in order to facilitate the working of B.O.A.C. aircraft using Alnaza - to instal a B.O.A.C. Assistant Flight Supervisor in the area control room, from where he will be able to give rapid decisions regarding his Company’s aircraft by authorising diversions and vetting terminal weather data etc. Owing, it is understood, to legal implications, it is a regretable fact that similar arrangements cannot be made in respect of the safety of British aircraft other than those owned by the Corporation. It is also the intention to establish a Search and Rescue Co-ordinating organisation in the Control Room; but in the meantime, and particularly with regard to Sea Search, the Controllers will have to be entirely dependent on aid available through R.A.F. Headquarters MED/M.E., in co-ordination with the Naval facilities at Malta. For land search in the Cairo area, there are available aircraft of the R.E.A.F. and R.A.F., and the Egyptian Camel Corps and Customs organisation. The problem of the comparatively un-trained Egyptian control staff still remains - particularly after the support and advice emanating from the loaned British Controllers has been withdrawn. The Egyptian Govem-icnt is, however, determined to assume its responsibilities in this respect, however illfitted to implement them the Control personnel may be. The Control Staff is to consist of four Supervisors assisted by untrained civilians. EGYPT. SECTION II. Paragraph 3/! T-T ,r ~ — - 4 - CONFIDENTI/Jli. EGYPT - SECTION II, ^SRODHOKJS - Paragraph 3» 3 . AIliAZuv VERSUS F^OUIl . The Egyptian Director of Aerodromes has stated that his Govenuient cannot afford to run two acrodrones in Cairo, and the number of movements having:' no\r dropped to 50/60 per day, the use of two aerodror.Bs is not at the moment justified. The decision - ^ to build up either FarouV. or AL.iaza has still to be taken. The Heliopolis Oasis Company own the land upon which Farouk Airport is constructed, and are only willing to sell the land for a very large sum. The Director also stated that there was no intention of asking B.O.A.C. to move from Almaza to Farouk in the near future. 4. EI1BABA . Details of this newly opened aerodrome are given in Egyptian NOTICE TO AIRMEN No. Il;yi947 ( se e Section I paragraph 2). As reported in Nev/sletter No. 1/47 the National Air Services Company is already installed here, arid Misr Aeronautical Institute and Flyirg Club are expected to novo from Almaza to Embaba on 1st January 1948. No customs facilities yet exist at Embaba. SECTION III. AIR OPERATING COMPANIES. 1. TRANS WORLD AIRblNSS . As forecast in the previous Newsletter T.'T.A. have made known their intention to oi-&gt;erato through lydda instead of Cairo, 7/hether the Company will withdraw this intention in view of the disturbed position in Palestine is not known.

(a) An Indonesian cadet attached to the Flying School belonging' to this Company was killed in an accident on 20th December while piloting, a plane which crashed near limb aba. (b) Further information is now to hand regarding this Company. The Company do not own Nord 1001’s (as erroneously reported in Newsletter No. 1/47). Aircraft belonging to the N.A.3. Club are three Max Holste 52, and one Nord 1203 Norecrin, plus another Norecrin, two Fairchilds and an Auster Autocrat which all belong to members. The N.A.S. maintenance hangar is well equipped and the Club, under the direction of its chief Pilot Victor Coffer, hope eventually to become capable of carrying out C. of A. inspections on all light aircraft registered in Egypt. (c) The N.A.S. club trainer is the Max Holste 52. These three little all-metal French aircraft have been fitted with D.Ii. Gipsy Major engines bought by Coffer from Airwork Limited, and installed at the factory. They replace the 140 h.p. Renault power units originally fitted. N.A.S. asked this Office to help then find ex. R.A.F. spares for the Gipsy Major engines, and were informed at the time of installation that spares should be applied for through normal commercial channels. As far as is knovm they have not yet done this, and as a result it is possible that N.A.S. will have to stop operating the Holstes soon for lack of spares. (d) The Club charges L.E.4 P&lt; 3 r hour for the Kolsto and L.E .6 per hour for the Norecrin, dual or solo. N.A.S. hope to hold on inaugural Flying Display in the near future. (e) Major Joss, of the Eastern Automobile Supplies and Transport Company S.A.S., recently flew one of the N.A.S. Max Holste aircraft, and the following are his impressions of the machine’s performance- ’’Although the TIolste after its conversion is perhaps a little under powered, the p&gt;il°t is given that comforting reassurance which de Havilland engines engender. The aircraft is extremely strong and gives the impression that it will withstand any amount/.. EGYPT. SECTION IV. Para 1(e)...- 7 - EGYPT. SECTION V. PARA. 7/.... cowimmudj.

The Government, however, is refusing to release this amount in dollars and is asking the Company to accept its equivalent in Egyptian pounds. On the other hand, the Government is demanding that landing fees payable by T.7.A. should be paid in dollars, while the Company insists on these being paid in sterling. Other differences concern the difficulties experienced by the Company in connection with formalities and ether matters .... Other airlines have experienced similar difficulties, and since the outbreak of cholera there have been changes in several of the routes. Some of these services may not revert to Cairo as a landing point.... Meanwhile at the request of the Egyptian Ministry of National Defence the American met.

It is wellknown that the Palestine ' Goverment had for a long time cherished the thought of securing this traffic ov/ing to tne enormous advantages and profits to bo derived therefrom The advantages offered at lydda consist of the exemption from customs dues on petrol and ^are-parts, simplification of customs formalities and the suppression of many other inconveniences from vrhich passengers have often complained ^hon landing in Egypt .... According to statistics drai/n up just before the cholera cwidcmic Egyot benefitted to the extent of over £ 200,000 per month from airborne traffic passing through Cairo.

(a) ^ This Company desire to run a repular air service between Syria and Palestine, Developments of this, together with details of route (s) will be reported upon later. ( b ) Syrian Airways was formed at the end of last year ( 1946 ) v/ith a capital of three million Syrian pounds, one million being subscribed by the thirty foundation members, and the remainder being open to public subscription. Neither the Syrian Government nor any foreign Government or Company have a financial holding. (c) When the Company was formed Hr. Sedhnawi, the Director, bought two Dakotas from Pan American Airways, P.A.A. also supplied tne pilots and equipment for these aircraft, but was refused a shareholding in the Company. The Company at present own four Dakotas, and are believed to be buying tv.a more. oyrim airways is at present staffed and opcra.ted entirely by American, personnel on short term contracts which are private and not a commitment of pan American Airways. A 3 far as X is known no s Aps have yet been taken to replace the A-ierican personnel by Syrians. The ij.ierican staff numbers about thirty, and the Syrian technic-al staff consists of one radio operator, one radio mechanic and one engineer. (e) During tne hadjaz season the Company runs services to Mecca; c-jid internal services are a.lso operated. They are at the moment operating no scheduled external services, 4. It was reported in the Egyptian, published newspaper LE PROGRES on lltn December that the .'.inister of Public V/orks in Syria intended to enlarge Mczze Aerodrome (Damascus), due to the increase of traffic now passing through the aerodrome.

TRANSJORDAN, 1. Referring to paragraph one under this heading in newsletter No.1/47, H.Q. IED/ME. state that the R.A.F. have no intention of evacuating Amman aerodrome at present. The information given us by Arab Airways Association was therefore incorrect. 2. The Transjordan G-overnment appreciate that the lengthening of the only possible runway at Amman airfield is their accepted responsibility in an attempt to render the airfield safe for local traffic. pt has been suggested to them that they might employ an aerodrome consultant. 3. The following is a general summary of civil aviation in Transjordan as at December 1947:- (a) AVIATION POLICY. The recently appointed Acting Director of public yorks, Tcv.fik Bey Marar, has also been appointed Acting Director of civil Aviation end ho attended the last Beard meeting of Arab Airways Association on 22nd November 1947, as representative of the Government - following the purchase by the latter of 23 00 shares (500 pounders, 2,000 Ordinary - 4,000 Votes), which is the voting qualification for election to the Beard. The Acting Director of civil Aviation has no staff to assist him o.t present. (b) AIR ACRFFMFNTS between Transjordan and other Middle East territories are still under negotiation, as are Fifth Freedom rights with Palestine - which have been agreed to in principle. (o) PRIVATE FLY ING. There are no privately owned aircraft in the country. (d) The Arab Airways Association plying school reported upon last month has two pupils ready to receive 'A' licences. (e) Arab Airways Association Limited is the only Air Operating Company within Transjordan. SA’UDI ARABIA/-SA ’ AUDI ARABIA paragraph 7 ( i) /, ~ 15 - CONPIDENTIiilj. S A » U D I ARABIA The follovar^; is a brief history of civil aviation in this country up to the present time:- 1. Prior to 1945 the only civil aircraft in Sa’udi Arabia were machines owned and operated by the concessionary Companies, the Arabian ^mierican Oil Company, and the Sa’udi Arabia Aining Syndicate. No foreign civil Air Service served Sa f udi Arabia except the British Overseas Airways Corporation Cairo-Aden service which larded at Jedda. 2. In 1945, however, Mr. Roosevelt met Xing ibn Sa'ud in Egypt on the occasion of his return from Yalta, and presented the King with a Dakota aircraft, together with the services of an Ary Air Force crew. The King was immediately impressed by the comfort and convenience of the machine, and it is from this single Dakota that the development of civil aviation in Sa'udi Arabia has sprung. 3. Originally the aircraft owned by the Sa’udi Arabian Government were reserved for the use of the Royal Household and of other official persons, and no scheduled flights were flown. The first Dakota presented by President Roosevelt was joined by a second, purchased by the Government, and the use of air transport for official purposes, both within and without the country became a commonplace. 4. In 1946 the United States Jerry Air Force Crews loaned by the American Government were withdrawn, on the expiry of the period for which they nad been lent, and the Sa’udi Arabian Government entered into an operating contract with Trans World Airlines, whereby personnel supplied by T.U.A. would fly and maintain the Government's aircraft and at the same time train ground staff and wireless operators, so that the organisation would eventually become sell-supporting. The training of pilots was reserved by the Sa'udi Arabian Government to the British Civil Air Mission (sec Newsletter No. 1/47). The .merican pilots are at present always accompanied by Sa'udi 'co—pilots”, but these latter arc not competent to handle -f-bo aircraft alone. 5. At about the same time the Sa'udi Arabian Authorities decided to expand their fleet of aircraft, and to begin to operate internal scheduled services. This policy has been continued and fostered under the technical guidance of TAT.A. and was- extended early in 1947 to include regular scheduled flights to Cairo. The present scheduled service is for a bi-weekly service Dharan- Riyadh-Eaif- Jedda-Cairo and return, and also an additional once-weokly service Jedda-Taif (at weekends). 6 . There are at present ten Dakota aircraft in use, three of which are reserved for the King's use and for official flights. The remaining seven arc fitted as commercial passenger aircraft. 7. Notwithstanding the jaiblishcd intention of the Government, regular air service schedules are but erratically maintained, the reason being twofold.- 16 - CONFIDENTIAL. SA’UDI ARIS1A paragraph 7(i)* • • (i) All aircraft are liable to be taken off the advertised services in order to move the Royal Household. (ii) The scheduled flights are profitable, but special ^ flights carrying pilgrims arc more so. paring the current pilgrimage season the normal scheduled services have been almost permanently suspended, more especially since the jedda-cairo service -;as necessarily abandoned on account of quarantine restrictions. Al hoc flights . for pilgrims were flown from jedda to Beirut, Medina and Karachi, pilgrims are o.lso given overriding priority on the scheduled jedda-pharan service, with the result that the call at Tuif has usually been omitted. 8. sa«udi Arabian Airlines is entirely Government owned and is controlled by the Ministry of Defence under the Amir Mansur, Commander-in-chief of the su'udi Arabian Army at T a if• There is - as far as can be asccrta.in.od - no managerial organ!section, and the details of administration are attended to by Mr. Jim parks, one of the American staff, whose office is at jedda airfield. The persons mainly concerned with the formulation of policy and with making day to day decisions arc the Amir Mansur and more particularly his secretary, who no doubt consults the Ministry of Finance; also Shaikh Ibrahim Tuscan the commander of the jedda garrison and Officer-in-Charge of jedda airfield. The last nam~d probably takes more decisions than any other individual, his sole criterion appearing to be '•will it pay?'. 9. The T. .A. Staff hove no responsibility for policy. They act as a restraining influence through their hard work and high standard of technical maintenance. At present 18 Americans are employed by sa»udi Arabian Airlines of whom nine are pilots, one an administrator, and the remainder mechanics and maintenance personnel. ro figures are available as to the number of sa'udis employed, none of the s a 'udis are qualified pilots and consequently for ten aircraft only nine aircrews arc available. 1 0 . s a ’udi Arabian Airlines is the only company in sa’udi Arabia, but the following trunk and Middle past operating companies fly to and through Sa’udi Arabia ; ~ B.O.A.C. Ethiopian Airlines. T.vY.A. Middle East Airlines. Air prance. K.L.M. Qantas Empire Airwayc. 11. sa’udi Arabia is not a signatory to any international air agreement. The Government’s attitude to the Five Freedoms is clas-tio. First Freedom rights are usually readily granted on application, subject to the aircraft following a prescribed route designed to ensure that the aircraft does not pass within sight or sound of Mecca, Medina or Riyadh, arid that it avoids in general all inland centres of population. The right of non-traffic stop is/... SA’AUDI ARABIA para. 11/...IRAQ, paragraph 2/. - 17 - . coi'Ipidef:' 1 .j j . S^'UDI paragraph 11 /... is readily granted under similar conditions. The Third and Fourth Freedoms have never been seriously disputed, but there is an increasing tendency to demand automatic reciprocal rights in return. The attitude to the Fifth Freedom is similar. During the pilgrimage season no objection is raised to the arrival of any a.ircraft engaged in the transport of pilgrims from anyv/hcrc at cither Jedda or Dharan, provided that passports ere in order, and Customs duties, aircraft landing tax and passenger quarantine dues and pilgrimage dues - where applicable -'are paid. ' The Government automatically interprets such an arrival as authorising: then to fly similar flights in the return direction, 12. The only first class aerodrome in Satudi drabia is the old United States dmy Air Force base at Dharan on the cast coast. This was handed over to the Sa’udi Arabian Government late in 1946 when the A.T.C. ceased to make extensive use of it. The ground staff, however, is still provided by the U.3.A.A.F., who are training- Sa'udi Arabians to take over at some future date. 13. lip art from Dharan there are airfields at Jedda, Taif, Hohuf and Riyadh. Some naps show an airfield at '.Vejh, but there are no facilities there. Messrs.^Bechtel International Incorporated arc now undertaking a comprehensive scheme of improvements on these airfields, and have started work at Riyadh, It is not known exactly what is in view, but it is believed that the construction of permanent runways is contemplated. * This is the American engineering: firm which is handling: the construction of the pipeline from Sa'udi .jrabia to the Mediterranean for the Arabian-American Oil Company.

The General Manager of the Company is Colonel Sabah as-Said, the Technical Adviser is Colonel M.C .P. Mostert, O.B.E., and the Commercial Adviser is Mr. B. Bamfylde. Mr. Bamfylde has been loaned by B.O.A.C., and will be replaced as Commercial Adviser by Sayid Kanaan al Askari when the latter returns from training in the United Kingdom. Iraqi flying and ground personnel are being trained by B.O.A.C. so that the Company may eventually be entirely manned by Iraqi staff. All traffic personnel are already Iraqis. The aircraft at present being operated by this Company consist of 3 de Havilland Rapides, two Vickers Vikings, and tv/o de Havilland Doves. A further Viking and another Dove are to reach Iraq by the end of December 5 and the D.H. Rapides will be taken out of service on 31st January 1948. The proposed new routes of Iraqi Airways are as follovvs:- (i) Baghdad-Karachi via Basra, Bahrein and Sharjah on probable bi-weekly frequency. Aircraft will be Vikings. The tentative commencement date is 1st January 1948, but it is not known whether the permission of the Pakcstan Government has yet been obtained, (ii) Baghdad-United Kingdom, via Nicosia, Athens, Rome and Marseilles, as reported upon in Newsletter No. 1/47• Frequency bi-monthly with Vikings which will be overhauled in the U.K. Fifth Freedom rights in the U.K. have been accorded, but those in Cyprus, Greece and Italy are still under negotiation.

Such aircraft must now land at Basra. I R A N (PERSIA) GOVERNMENT POLICY. 1. The Department of Civil Aviation in the Ainistry of Roads of the Imperial Government of Iran has recently issued International NOTAH No. 4, 1947 the title of which is 'Official altitude of Mehrabad Airport'. 2. A Bilateral civil aviation agreunent is in process of negotiation between the British and Iranian Governments. 3. The Persian Government ar^ seeking civil aviation advisers from the British Government. With this end in view Group Captain Scott- Farnie of International Aeradio is now on a visit to Persia to discuss Persia's radio requirements with Hr. Chafik, the Director-General of the Department of Civil Aviation. 4. Regarding’ meteorological assistance - reported upon in Newsletter No. 1/47 - due to cholera restrictions the visit of Group Captain Veryard from Headquarters R.„.F. MuD/ivi.E. has been put back until early January 1948* 3. In the meantime a. course has been started at Melirabad Airport which aims to produce individuals capable of combining the duties of meteorological observer, radio operator and mechanic. At present twelve yourvg Persians from the Teheran Technical High School form the first course. Mr. Chafik states that progress is satisfactory, ard that the individuals, when fully qualified, will be sent in pairs to outstations throughout Persia. 6 . The present meteorological staff in Persia consists of one qualified forecaster and four observers in Teheran, with about six partial]# trained observers in Hamdan, Hermans hah and Isfahan.

H.B.M's Air Attache • in Teheran has made a survey of the landing: grounds alor\g the soutlxrn coast of Persia, which he has visited or observed from the air. He v/as accompanied on this survey by i.r. Chafik. The following landing grounds arc inductea in the survey Abadan, Basidu, Hen jam and Hormuz, Bushire, Lingch and Jask, Charbar, Asalu Bandar Abbass. 8, Abadan Airport. Skyways Limited has made an offer to the Director General of Civil Aviation to staff and equip Abadan airport up to international standard. Although this step would be beneficial to Persia., owing to the Department of Civil Aviation's present lack of finance and authority to engage foreigners, it is not likely tnat the ..latter will be pursued until these obstacles have been overcome. 9• Tabriz Airfield. It is understood that financial approval has been obtained for the construction of one asphalt strip at Tabriz. »/ork will not commence until the spring, but it is hoped to complete the stripy during the summer. 1/jr. Chafik has also given instruc cions for cne erection of a terminal building on this airficle* 10. Mehrabad Airport (Teheran), (a) Major General Pirouz, Iranian Minister of Communications recently visited Lordon to obtain advice on the requirements of an airport at Teheran to the international standards required for trunk route aircraft. In the absence of a technical report on tmo present airfield at Mehrabad General Firouz was informed that recommend a cions or estimates given could only be extreunely tentative, end. tne only^ means by which a final statc..nnt on the requirements and cost coula be arrived at would bo by a survey of the present civil airficlaj a - Lj - c ' if necessary other sites, by a party of experts in Tnc fielo.

The British ministry of Civil irriation hc.ye^ therefore now supplied General Pirouz mth a broad outline of siat is reciuired, and it is not yet known whether General lirouz will^docide to^ask for further assistance in order to obtain more detailed estimates of cost etc. It is unfortunate that the Civil Air Attache - during his visit to Iran last August - was not given tne opportunity of oeing^ introduced to General Pirouz, and giving his advice on this subject. (b) Details known of the present Mehrabad Airport are as follows The aerodrome is situated at a distance of ^4 miles from Teheran, to tlx west of the city at a height of l r) 07o feet above moan soa level. The present layout is of two runways of concrete construction, of v/hich the bearing strength is not known. The dimensions of these runways arc Bast to 'Test 6,000 by 150 feet, and North to South 6,000 by 150 feet. The gradients of the runways ore not known. (c) The Director General of Civil Aviation Persia lias stated that the meteorological office at Mehrabad Airport is now alaost fully equipped. Repairs are in hand to a transmitter .Mich - when serviceable - v.dil be used for broadcasts of collectives.

(b) Since September 16th Air France has be^n operating its v/eekly service froa Paris to Teheran via Tunis, Tripoli and Baghdad, instead of via Marseilles, Rone, Brindisi, Athens, Cyprus and Beirut. This results in the flight taking 23 hours instead of 52 hours. Douglas LC-A’s are used. 12. AIR SURVEY FOR PBRSIAN OIL. The following is an extract from the 'Tines' 1 of 27th November 1947:- 'A contract granted by the /jiglo-Iranian Oil Company to Hunting Aerosurveys provides for an aerial survey of 10,000 square miles of Persia with the object of finding further oil deposits. Most of the survey will bo made at a height of 22,000 feet, and a specially modified Bristol Freighter aircraft is being used. The aircraft will carry to Persia, a team of nine pilots, navigators, radio-operators and photographers, who will carry out the survey'. This Bristol Freighter left the United Kingdom on 15th December, and flew to Teheran via Cyprus. 13. AIRCRAFT FOR 'THE SHAH OF PERSIA. Messrs. I/fight ways Air Service Limited have recently delivered a Miles Messenger aircraft to H.M. The Shah of Persia for his private use. INTERNAL OPBRATINC COIPAMISS. 14. IRARTMJ'T STATE MLRLIH3S . Financial approval has now been given for the purcha.sc by the Ministry of posis, Telegraphs and Telephones for six Miles Gemini aircraft to be used by this Company for postal services. It is not yet confirmed that the necessary sterling permit is available for the placing of a definite order. 15. IRANIAN -TIRNAfS. The team of K.L.M. technicians arrived in Teheran on November 8th to assist this Company, and offered to make the Company's five available Dakotas sufficiently serviceable to be ferried to Amsterdam for complete overhaul. Durirg the overhaul period K.L.M. offered to provide their own Dakotas and crews for external and internal flights. When it was realised that K.L.M. pilots were to be paid 2,000 dollars per month under this proposal Iranian Airways decided to limit the agreement to the loan of three engineers. The remainder of the K.L.M. team then returned to Holland, and were followed by the three engineers shortly afterwards.’ On 26th November it was reported that the Director General of Civil wviation had ordered this Company to cease operations owing to alleged dangerous flying and poor maintenance. Two days later, however, Iranian Airways flew a scheduled flight to Tabriz, followed the next day by one to Meshed and a few days later one of their aircraft left for Paris. It appears therefore that the Company has been able to/ IRAN, paragraph 15/,CONFIDENTIAL - 23 - IRAN, paragraph ...... TURKEY, paragraph l(d)/. to satisfy the Department of Civil Aviation that the condition of their aircraft and pilots has improved. The latest information to hand is that of the sixteen Dakotas belonging to this Company, eight are in the so-called cemetery in a cannabalised state, five in a partially cleaned up condition but without engines, one is serviceable and being used for interns-.! services, and one is still being overhauled in Paris; the last of the sixteen has just arrived from American Disposals at Paynefield, Cairo. Apart from the Iranian co-pilots the Company have one French pilot acting as Chief of Operations, a nationalised British pilot of French extraction, and an ex, S.A.A.F. Officer who intends to return to South Africa in the near future, 16. EAGLE AIRLINES. B.O.A.C. and the Directors of this Company have signed an agreement covering B.O.A.C.’s technical and managerial assistance. The provision of aircraft has been held up by the lack of a sterling; currency permit due to protracted discussions within the Persian Exchange Control Commission concerning the availability of sterling. In the middle of December, however, the necesssjry sterling permit for £ 25,000 was obtained to meet the deposit on the three Doves for this airline. It is hoped that the first Dove will be delivered during January, In the absence of any regular schedules being flown by Iranian Airways, Eagle Airlines may eventually operate on both the Northern and Southern internal routes. // TURKEY 1. AER0DRQ?iES. (a) The American companies of Westinghouse and &lt;j.G. White are willing to undertake the development of the airfields at Yesilkoy, Esenbuga and Adana, They have estimated that the work on each airfield will be completed 'within eighteen months from its commencement Before work can commence at any of the three airfields local contracts have to be let, and this is likely to take a considerable time. In the case of each of the three airfields, therefore, the period before completion is likely to be eighteen months plus an unknown period representing the time which it takes to let the local contracts. Estimates of the length of this 'unknown period' are, Esenbuga six months, Yesilkoy and Adana,nine months each. (b) The contracts which have been signed relate to the development of these three airfields to I.C.A.O. Class 'B' standard, 1th a clause covering subsequent work to be done at the airfields at Izmir and Elazig. It has been announced in the Turkis press that the first materials are now being despatched from. America. (c) In addition to the work to be done at the above three airfields it has been contracted that certain radio-navigational aids should also be installed at the five following locations: Afyon, Konya, Erzurram, Eskisohir, Bor. Bor is at the mouth of the Taurus and was reconnoitred for an airfield during the war, when it was decided that construction was impossible. There is- as yet no. project to build an airfield, and only a radio beacon will be installed at present.- 24 - GOlfipzmUL^ TURKEY paragraph l(&amp;) TlfdC.Y, paragraph 9/.

MIDDLE EAST AIR TRAN SPORT BOARD SERVICES Iggl ACTENT DY ^RITf SH 'OVERSEAS AIRVAYS CORPORATION &amp; SLA NETWORK 1. TODDS EAST A I R TRANSPORT BO/^D . (a) * The Middle East Air Transport (M.D.A.T.) Board came into Being early in 1944 and took over from what vras known as the ’’Moyne Committee’', The terms of reference were - in hrief- to provide through the medium of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, a coirprehensive network of air services to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces and entitled civilians• (b) At the end of the war these services were reviewed with a view to economising in money, material resources and manpower, since the M.E.A.T. Board services - which are paid for by Kis Majesty’s Government - are an expensive item and locked up the British Overseas Airways Corporation’s resources which were required elsewhere for commercial enterprises. (o) As a result of this review all M.E.A.T. Board services^on routes covered by local airlines were'withdrawn in favour of the local airlines, and nubsoquently passengers from Cairo to destinations such as Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad, were no longer sponsored by the M.E.A.T. Board but had to make their own arrangements with the local Conpanies. (d) The Services hitherto known as '’M.E.A.T. Board Services , and now to be operated by B.O.A.C. - probably from about 20th January 1948 are as follows (also see 'B.O.A.C.' under -^gypt. Section III):- i) 15/16R Cairo-Luxor-Port Sudan-^smara-Kamaran^Aden (l weekly) • ii) 17/18R Cairo-Wadi Half a-Khartoum~Asmara-Aden-Margeisha- Mogadischu-Nairobi (l weekly) ^temporarily teminating at Hargeisha). iii) l9/20R Cairo-Wadi Halfa-Khartoum-Asmara-Kamaran-Aden (l^weekly), iv) 25/26E Cairo-Wadi Halfa-Khartoum-Malakal-Juba-Kisumu-Nairobi (2 weekly). All four services are operated with Dakotas, which from 15th December have replaced the Lodestars previously in use on (i) (ii) a nd ( 111 )• (e) The folio-wing M.E.A.T. Board services have been cancelled recently:- (i) 7/8N Cairo-NicoSia-Tstanbul-^Ankara (2 weekly). Temporarily suspended due to cholera, will be resumed on 1st January lyAh if the Turkish restrictions have been lifted by then. (ii) 54/53 Cairo—Khartoum-Nairobi—Dar-es-Salaam (l weekly) withdrawn. This service has been replaced by 9/10J U.K./Dar-es-Salaam (l weekly) service, operated by York aircraft w.e.f. 4th December 1947• 2, BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION PROPOSED RED SEA NTOQS 1 ^ (a) Last year, when the formation of Egyptian Airways was in the offing, it was considered that the Southern or Red Sea routes still operated by the M.E.A.T. Board should be handed over to Egyptian Airways, and the M.E.A.T. Board would then close down. Unfortunately, for various reasons, Eg ptian Airways was not iormed ana ic benovo the British Government to find some other means of servicing t e 'uncovered' routes. APPENDIX 'A' PARA, 2 (b)/......Page 2 of APPEND IX 'A' Paragraph 2 (b) GONP IDS!'!T IAL No. 2/47. (b) With this end in view, and after consultation vdth the relevant Authorities, B.0«A.C. Middle East Regional Management has reoentljr carried out a survey of the Red Sea area to investigate the possibility of operating commercial services based on British territory in the Middle East, Such services would be operated at no expense to the taxpayer, whereas in the case of the M.E.A.T, Board services, the Board could order B.O.A.C. to supply additional services on any route at any time, and the bill v/as met by His Majesty’s Government, (c) As a result of the B.O.A.C. survey it appeared that there was a large enough traffic potential to start a series of Colonial air services based on Aden, Cyprus and N a i ro bi # Jn addition - and to take up the slack pending the formation and expansion of these Companies - London has agreed to extend certain of the U.K./Cairo air services to such points as Aden, Addis Ababa and - airobi. These services will be the nucleus of the Colonial services. They must stand on their own feet in the same manner as the local Arab services, and battle for their traffic against such competitors as Sa’udi Arabian Airlines and- Ethiopian Airlines who are trying hard to exnand their routes, (d) The proposed extension of the B.O.A.C. U.K,/Cairo services, as recommended by the B.O.A.C. survey party are as follows (i) Cairo-Asmara-iAddis Ababa one weekly, with extension to Nairobi once fortnightly, (ii) Cairo^Asraara-A-den-Nairobi once weekly, via Hargeisha and Mogadischu. (iii) Cairo-Jedda-Port Sudan-Asmara-Kanaran Island-Aden once weekly. (e) The following services based on Aden are also recommended:- ±) Aden-Riyan once fortnightly. ii) Aden-Addis Ababa once weekly. iii) Aden-Djibouti-Addis Ababa once weekly. iv) Aden-Hargeisha-Addis Ababa once weekly. Services (d) fi) and (ii) would be operated with furnished Dakotas, and services $ (iii), (c) (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) would be operated with unfurnished Dakotas. (f) Services in both (d) and (e) have been approved in principle by the Ministry of Civil .aviation. Pending their possible commencement late in January B.O.A.C. No. 1 Line are to operate the existing M.E.A.T. Board services in paragraph l(d) as an interim measure. Due to cholera restrictions still in force B.O.A.C. may not yet operate to Jodda or Addis Ababa, (g) In addition Cyprus Airvrays will - in February - oo mence operating a Nicosia/Cairo and Nicosia/Ankara-Istanbul service, (h) it is expected that a full meeting of the M.A.A.T, Board will bo convened in the immediate future to discuss the above proposals, and the future of the Board itself.
