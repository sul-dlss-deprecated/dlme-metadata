The illustration is the work of ('amal-i) Manuhar.\r\n\r\n This is a deluxe copy of the Khamsah (quintet) of Am\u012br Khusraw Dihlav\u012b (d. 725 AH / 1325 CE). The manuscript was written in nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script by one of the greatest calligraphers of the Mughal atelier, Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usayn al-Kashm\u012br\u012b, honored with the epithet Zarr\u012bn Qalam (golden pen). This copy of Dihlav\u012b's Khamsah, likely produced in Lahore (present-day Pakistan) in the late tenth century AH / sixteenth CE, is associated with the patronage of Akbar (r. 963-1014 AH / 1556-1605 CE).
