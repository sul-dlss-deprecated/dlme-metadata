To The Hon*ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushlre . SUBJECT . American civil air facilities in Muscat . Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence on the subject cited above resting with my telegram No.C 245 dated the 6 th May, and to forward for your infonaation a copy of letter No.S/48 dated the 6 th May, 1946 from His Highness the Sultan. A copy of His Highness* letter No.S/55 dated the 27th August, 1945, referred to in my telegram No.S 1163 dated the 28th August, 1945 is also enclosed. ^ m , V ^ ^ 2. When I approached His Highness for the required facilities he immediately expressed surprise that the Government of the United States had not seen fit to address him on this subject and stated that it would be very difficult for him to give any answer, especially in view of the reply he had given in regard to a similar approach made to him concerning the operations of an American survey party last year. Being certain that, given time, His Highness* good sense would lead him to a more satisfactory attitude, I contented myself with observing that as the request for air facilities was being made on behalf of the United States Government, who themselves had no representative at Muscat I could see no particular grounds for his concern over the method of approach andand that I hoped he would give the matter his consideration. Four days later His Highness visited me at the Agency to discuss the matter further and asked my advice on the reply he should give, his only reference to the method of approach being an enquiry as to whether I saw any objection to his draw ing attention to this in his reply. During the interview His Highness expressed his intention of following the general principles in regard to International Aviation, agreed upon at the Chicago Conference of 1944. His Highness asked for time to study the Chicago Agreements with the result that his reply was not received until yesterday. 3. Yesterday a party of American officials, which in cluded a Vice-Consul from their Dhahran Consulate ; arrived at Muscat by air for discussion with His Highness concerning the disposal of American equipment at Masirah and Salalah and it is possible, though I think improbable, that His Highness may have mentioned the subject to tho American Vice-Consul. It may be of interest to note that in recent conversation with me, His Highness stated that until Mr.Parker Hart, the American Consul at Dhahran informed him verbally on the 14th April this year that Muscat was included in his Consular area, he was under the impression that the American interests in Muscat were in the charge of the American Consul at Bombay. He is in fact still without any official information regarding the position which . the United States Government consider their Consular officers at Dhahran to have in Muscat.
