(149048) Sir:- I have the honour to transmit herewith, copy of a despatch from Hie Majesty’s Consul at Lausanne enclos ing a statement made by an Ottoman subject named Ahmed Riza Bey, relative to anti-English intrigues in • Constantinople and Egypt. I should be glad of your instructions as regards the final paragraph of Mr. Galland’s despatch. 1 am forwarding copies of the documents to His Majesty*: I h Gommissioner for Egypt. 1 have, &amp;c., (Signed) Acton. (For the Minister) The Right Honourable ...ir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P.Brants CONSULATE, LAUSAKKE. October 6th, 1916. bir:- By direction of Consul Galland, I have the honour to remit herewith two copies of a deposition made a few days ago at this Office by a Turkish subject who calls himself Ahmed Elza Bey. The man, however, is probably a fraud, as he never turned up again after pi’omlsing to call, in two or three days time, for a further important informa tion. He said he needed, meanwhile, a small advance of money, and, unfortunately, I followed the advice of Mr. La Fontaine, the interpreter, and gave him one hundred francs. I hope this sum may be reimbursed by the Government. I am, &amp;c., Ibigned l auriee Galland. Evelyn Grant Duff, Esq., dbC., &amp;C. , ccC. ho.Td.khsed Elza Bey, who calls himself a lurklsh official, employed by the Ottoman Government, as Messenger, to carry letters and despatches, addressed to the Turkish Consul General at Geneva, called upon me and offered to divulge secrets in connection with events in the East, which in his opinion, might prove to be useful to the British Government. Eot knowing iurkish myself, 1 asked for the assistance of It. Charles La Fontaine, a British subject, residing in Lausanne, who is thoroughly acquainted with the languages spoken in the East. .limed Liza Bey states: 1. 1'hat there are in Constantinople two Turkish officials, who are supposed to be helping air Ian Hamilton,at the lardanelles, with plans of the fortifi cations, and, the number of regiments defending them, from time to time, and the quantities of ammunitions these forces can dispose of. 2. That these plans are those of the General Ltaff, in Constantinople. 3. That these two officials, where introduced to tir Ian Hamilton, by a Captain or Major Leeds (?) formerly in the service of the Turkish Gendarmerie in Constantinople. 4. That their names are: Ahmed 2 ia (alias L.ehemed Chulsri) Mehemed Abdullah. A General Merchant and Turkish official, at the same time. 5 . That they are paid for their services LlOO each a month, 6. That these two officials are betraying their present employers, and that the plans they have sub mittedsmmlttea are Intentional^ gilelpaaliu. In every leiiMOt 7. Iliat they travel in the far zone, with a pass from the English Lilitary Authorities, and with passports given them on the 28th of May, this year, by the ottoman Consul General at the riraeus. 8. That Mehetned Abdullah is supposed to have gone to oofla, to make the acquaintance of Mr. JPrltz -Maurice for what purpose it is not disclosed. 9. That these two officials are in constant com munications with the Vail (Governor General) of osnyrna, who is supposed to have been promised a handsome reward for any valuable assistance given to the Allies. This man - the Veil - is a traitor , and is not to be trusted. 10. That ierteb Pacha (?) the Military Governor of Liayrna is supposed to have gained the confidence of the English Authorities, but is also a traitor, and in no way Is he to be truatecL. 11. That the brother of this .acha, a colonel in Turkish Army* in unyraa, too, who is said to be in the pay of the English, Is likewise to be Mfe tgMiM. 12. That these two officials utilise the services of a certain Abody Effendi, a Turkish spy, and now dragoman of the Ottoman Consulate, at the Piraeus, for . their secret communications, with the Turkish Embassy in Athens, as to what is going on at the English Embassy. To avoid indiscretions, the interviews take place at nijht at .atlesia (?) near Athens. 13. That Enver Pacha's brother, a certain Musta Bey, who is living in Egypt, unknown to the Anglo- : Egyptian Police Authorities, it is supposed, and a Turkish officer - Mahmoud Media Bey - one of paver Pacha'sPacha's confidential friends, make use of the two Arabs (names not given) one from fangah, and the other from rort baid for their correspondence with the Ottoman Consul General at the i iraeus. 14. That, besides, these two Arabs, two officers of the Turkish Amy, in disguise, are sent on similar errands to Greece, and. back to ^gypt, these two travelling as far as one of the Greek islands, to meet out, at sea, Arab Gaiquis ‘ (large rowing boats sent for the purpose); those in charge take delivery of the money, and correspondence received from Constantinople for the revolutionary party in Sgypt. She name of the Greek steamer, which starts from the Piraeus, will be supplied later on; these trips take place, once or twice a month, if possible, and the Captain, a Greek, closes his eyes to these illicit transactions, of course, he is well paid for his services. 15. That ' Yanko Andon *, the one eyed Agent of a Greek Steam Boat Company is, under contract, to carry by his boats, food and other supplies, for the officers and sailors, interned at Chic, of the Turkish Torpedo boat sunk there. This agent is not satisfied with this occupation, but tries in every possible way to obtain information about the movements of the English and Trench men of war, and gives it to the Ottoman consulate at the Piraeus for transmission to Constantinople. He is handsomely paid, when the inform ation can be turned to proper account. 16. That it is a well known fact, that this man has been supplying the German submarines with oil, &amp;c., and facilitating their work. 17. That as far sis India goes, Hagi uany Bey, a CircassianCircassian, liar. Bey, likewise a circaetian, and i.utchuk All Bey, accompanied py three German officers, were sent six weeks ago by the Comittee of Young Turks on a visit to ielM, to endeavour to raise a revolution rmionr the Indian , ohamedans. ’They first tried Delhi v.itb little success, and are now travelling in other parts of the country with the hope of doing better. 18. That their letters to Constantinople are all sent through Afganistan and ersia. 19. That three other Turks: Missirly Youssouf Effendi, Selim laolt Bey, and D^emil Bey, were sent to the Sudan on a similar mistion, but they too were unsuccessful in their attempts to do mischief. In spite of this check, they are still working in the environs of Khartoum; their letters reached Constantinople, through Farrar, and the Italian Consulate at rltrca. Now it is the Spanish Consulate there that takes charge of their correspondence, and ads it on if , fj re it i» i to Turkey. The three men emiloyed for this work are Turkish officers, in Arab disguise. ; 0. That Ahmed Riza Bey has the key to the private codes used by Enver Pacha and Talaat Bey, for their secret correspondence with Ghalib Bey, Ottoman IVinister in Athens, and Fithy Bey, Ottoman Minister in Sofia, and is willing to explain these codes and to hand them over to the person the English Goverranent may name. 21. That the reason why he did not go to the - English Consulate, in Geneva, with this information is that this town being a hot bed of political intrigue, andand being crowded with Turks, every second man being a secret agent of the Ottoman Government, his movements would have been watched, and at once reported to Head quarters.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. /surcj /1915 and address— The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office, London.

Madrid Confidential r f une IJtli 1915 , f Sir Prinoe Aslz Eabaan of Sgypt called upon mo yesterday with a letter from Kis Majesty # s Ambassador at Rome recommend inf: him to my good offices. Bir Kennel 1 Rode- had previously infoimed me In a confidential note of the oircuastanccs which had oblig ed the Prince to leave Turkey, first for Italy and later, when Italy was drawn into the war, for Spain. The Prince lunched at the Smbaesy quite privately and qui etly today with Brdy !'*rdlnge, myself, -r. Hope Vere and an Bn- glish lady and her son, now staying at Madrid. In the ce ;rse of two longish conversations which I had with him yesterday and this afternoon ho talked with h good deal of freedom: whilst he made no pretence of concealing his past close relations with the Ccnuittoe of Union and Progress at Constant!nor1® or r cer tain »yu;athy for the Pf nifclamic movement in Brrbsry, hgypt and India, he did not hesitate severely to criticise the seven lead ers of the Committee who had, he said, established in Turkey a tyr-ny far severer than that of Sultan Abdu' Id at his worst, end who, hating one another, still held together, as the one means Th*. Eight Konble. , Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P.,neans of eeving their neoka, and # oy Germrn help, their despotlo rule. He explained their hostility to England by purely personal considerations; one of theia being Six Ger ard Lowther *s strong support of the late Kiaiail Pasha, v/hon they detested, adding that thou^-h their relations with Sir Lou ie liallet htul been much naoro friendly, the latter had oosie on to the scene too late, when the die had already long been oast in favour of Germany. He thought however that if o 'T fleet had purLued the Goeben and Breslau through the Dardanelles, and captured cr sunk thea in the sea of ifi-raora, German influence in Turkey would have received n fetal blow. As it was he ferred the Porte would 'p&amp;y the piper':he doubted indeed our forcing the Dardanelles, at any rate for a considerable period, although we might easily have done so h*d we sent troops at first with the ships, and he seemed to expect that the war would end in e sort of drawn game as between England and Germany, which would make peace at the expense of the weaker powers, including the Ottoman Empire. He spoke a good dMl of the Khedive Lbb&amp;s, end of the Banner in which he had managed to alienate the ccnfidenoe both of the Turks and of ourselves; and he -mrprsssed his belief that Ills Highness' attempted assassination ih the summer of 1914 had been the work of the Committee of Union and Progress, who had j&amp;bsl&amp;gg distrusted, and decided to suppress him. MoreMore Irvber©string 'than these speculatIons and ccnjecturds were however some statements which he made as to the Prnis- lamlo Intrigue in the Mussulman Irnds held by the allies, promoted partly from Constant tno' le and paitrly from a Pan- Islamic school at Ilecoe whose chief teacher was a former Bgytim Arab 1 otuxer at Oxford. He expected thes to bear some fruit (1^ in Horth ' est India, where Admiral R Pasha had been sent on a mission ( reported if I remenber rightly by our press to have proved abortive ^ to Cabul. and (2^ in French Aoroooo, where Young Turkish fSmissaries ere very aotiwe. Borne of these were some youthful volunteers whom linver Pasha had picked up in Tripoli engaged in fight ing the Italians, had since utilised for intelligence work among the followers of the Benoussi in Barca, and had now despatched to French - net Spanish - Uorocoo, in order to proclaim the Turoo-German ‘Jehad*. He thought that in about two months time from now there would be a serious Moorish rising against the French Protectorate. I asked him hew the Moors could ever be brought to re cognise the Ottoman Caliphate? He said that Mulet Ha fid, with whom he had dined at Barcelona and who hatec the French bitterly and the Germans equally if not more so, would arrange this. It will not I should think be an easy task as far as- -— m —— — — —rra p the edaoated Moors r.re oonoerne^ f ; even if the present Sultan were set aside on religious grounds as a vassal of the infi dels, there would he thousands of other representatives of the Edrisite Caliphs of the vest, to whom the Turkish succes sion , lerived as it is,through adoption and not by descent from the Abbas(themselves in Moorish eyes usurpers\ would appear a grieveous schism. Still these technical ques tions, though they might hinder a final settlement need not prevent a rising against a common eneay, and it may be well that the lYenoh authorities should be aware that some intrigues of the nature above mentioned are afoot. I have mentioned the matter privately and unofficially to the Minister of State here with a view to Muled Ha fid’s being watched. His Ex cellency told me that he had the best reasons for knowing that under the apparent submission of the Moor© there seeth ed a deep hatred of the French, and that at a recent public gathering of Moorish Officials in French pay to welcome Ofm- erallyautoy back from somewhere to Bab&amp;t, the -withdrawal of the French staff had been the signal for an explosion among the native of bitter enmity for France and loudly ex pressed heroes for a German triumph over her. Spv■- .i-U; ca. Gem&amp;ny he said that the German Emperor in a xeoent interview with Jluktar Pasha, Ottoman Ambassador at Berlin, had remarked thatthat he welooned the Turks as Allies but thrt tfter the war, he would heve to ’civilize* theta if they still proved inca pable of oivlUsing themselves. Be rdded that the Committee at Constantinople were .veil aware cf this but had introduced German officers into the Turkish army on purpose to enforce o L&gt; discipline and force the officers to e^ch.^ politics. As regards the expedition against Kgypt he said that the recent operations wer~ only of an experimental nature undertaken to see how long it would take to throw a pontoon d-*i fttrini£ bridge across the Canal s icoecsf illy, f^easatl&amp;as which he said had been carried cut, and that they had shewn that a i serious forward movement oo ild only be undertaken with the help of heavy artillery, which was at this moment an its way and actually now crossing the Taurus Mountains. The offensive aga inst Egypt would begin in ITovember or December when the desert railway now in ^rooess of construction and the link of wells would be completed. He remarked that the Turks could j out the Canal at any moment if they wished to do so, but ab stained^ from doing sc as they were under the impression that such an event would forthwith occasion a declaration of war by Italy on Turkey which they had been anxious to stave off as long as possible. Prinoe Asia is no doubt rather garrulous and inquisitiveafter the fash on of his family bat I have thought it advis able to treat briefly on seme of the statements made by him on these various subjects in ease one or mor of them should oontain a germ of truth. 1 have the honour tc be with the highest respect, Bir Your most obedient humble servantIn any further communica- tiflii on this subject, please quote r No. / 1915 and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

In this letter Dr. Rifaat states that he was naturalized as an United states citizen several years ago during his residence at Philadelphia. 1 have, Me., (Signed) Evelyn Grant Duff. The Right Honourable air Edward Grey, Bart., K. G. , iVi • i J • ,LIHDAU a./B0DKM8EE, 22nd January, 1915. This is a copy of a letter addressed to the United States representatives in Europe and some of the Swiss authorities. Two months have already elapsed since a copy of my open letter to the Swiss Confederation has been forwarded to you: in which I nave endeavoured to explain the outlandish treatment and humiliation 1 had to encounter at the hands of the Geneva police, as a sequel to their wilful and deliberate lie and unfounded accusation against me. Up to tnis moment 1 have been anxiously awaiting a reply to my demands clearly formulated in the said letter, but to my extreme regret and astonishment neither kr. Hoffmann, the ex-i resident of the Swiss Republic, nor any of the United states representatives in hurcpe seem to have taken up the question seriously and gone at it with the necessary energy and interest required. 1 am compelled to come out of my reserve and to beg you to tell me kindly and frankly what you have really intended to do in my case? What steps have you so far taken? and what is the reason of this long and painful silence? In my previous letter I only asked for a thorough and impartial investigation in the matter, also to bebe allowed a fair chance to prove with a number of incontestable official documents - which I possess at present in my hands - the complete falseness and absurdity of the charges brought against me; and tne complicity of the Geneva Police and some of the owiss Authorities to ruin my name and reputation, i ask w now M a severe punishment of the stupid ana vulgar criminals. 1 ask a large and satisfactory compensation, moral and linancial for all sufferings and hardships I have met with at the hands of the Police: in adcition, 1 demand the immediate restoration of my stolen documents, personal letters, and books, etc.etc. 1 ask an official apology of the Gwiss Confedera tion to be published in all important nwiss papers indicating how 1 was roughly and unjustly accused and treated by the Geneva Police. 1 ask that my photo graph which has been ‘’stud” in all the criminal galleries of Switzerland to be at once withdrawn from amongst those of tue highway robbers and common criminals: I ask to be allowed a free entrance (if 1 should wish) to the bwiss territory: and finally, 1 ask that the rights of an United states citizen be respected with the dignity it deserves and not to be trodden upon by a certain class of individuals who have not the slightest consideration nor comprehension for the “rights of man” and international law. I am more than convinced that it is not in any way in harmony with the United States traditions and “fair play” that I snould now be abandoned to my sort in these hours of difficulty and hardship, especially whenwnen tiie tu;L;L rights of ari United states citizen were willingly granted to me several years ago during my residence in Fniladelphia. io my knowledge I have never yet&gt; discovered a single clause in the whole of the United States uiagna Uiarta” to differentiate between the equal rights of a born United states citizen and a natur al i^ee one, except in the case of the President which is required that he should be born upon American soil moreover if you look at the question from entirely a social stand point, 1 must say that 1 consider myself on equal footing - whether by birth, education or honesty - with any man like Lr. Hoffmann’s type, who did not take the least trouble in answering my appeal to him even on simple ethical principle. Let us go back to our main question: several years ago if I quite remember (1X4) a Greek subject who had been previously naturalized American citizen had chosen his residence in Morocco, and became engaged in business affairs. One day he was suddenly kidnapped by one of Hassouli’s men and hurried away in the interior of the country. A big ransorne was tiien asked for his release. Upon learning the event, the whole of the United Utates population were stirred up to a man. Ex-President Roosevelt lost no time: ordered the drafting on the spot of two of America’s greatest battleships with instruction to proceed immediately to the Moroccan waters to enforce tne rights of a United utates naturalized citizen. Here is the exact and brief declaration of the ex- President Roosevelt to the Uultan of Morocco in connexion with our subject 'Rasulis dead or Pericardis alive”.alive' 5 . Whereupon the matter was promptly settled to the great satisfaction of the United St tes. 1 do not by any means claim a similar pressure or demonstration to be exerted upon the Swiss authorities (and happily enough they possess no harbour) but I simply ask that my rights and interests should be at once looked after, as long as 1 am acknowledged legally and officially to be a United btates subject 1 hope 1 will not be forced once more to further 'come out of my reserve*' in order to reveal to the whole world all 1 know about the undignified and compromising procedure of some Swiss officials and Police Agents, nor to have to resort to communicate directly with the State Department at Washington, exposing all injuries and injustice I have suffered under the protection of the Star and otripe. 1 an, &lt;uc., (signed) Dr. &amp;i.

SECRET. : • ! 5^ Note by the Aga Khan and M. A. Ali Baig on the Situation in Egypt. (1.) An informal expression of our views on some aspects of the political situation in Egypt, and a brief reference to our endeavours to remove the uneasiness among some of His Majesty’s Moslem soldiers caused by the machinations of Turco-German agents, and at the same time to assist the British authorities in the formation of an atmosphere of mutual goodwill and understanding between the representatives of the Imperial Government and the Egyptians, may be of interest to the Marcpiess of Crewe and Sir Edward Grey. THE ATTITUDE OE THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE. CL) In the course of our sojourn in Egypt from the 19th of December Did to the 12th of .January 1915, we travelled over a thousand miles and visited Ismailia, Suez, Port Said, Tanta, Alexandria, and also all the camps of the Indian troops. Through the courtesy of the British Agency we had frequent opportunities of discussing Egyptian problems, especially in their relation to the new order of things, with the leaders of all shades of political thought, including the Prime Minister and bis colleagues, the ex-Premier Said Pasha and some ex-Ministers, the leader of the Opposition, the President of the Assembly, the members of His Highness the Sultan’s family, the representatives of the middle classes and of the Press, the ecclesiastics, the Ulemas and others. Our first impression, which still remains unchanged, was that except for the evidences of considerable military activity lor the defence of the country, there was no outward sign that the Egyptians were in any way perturbed by the great War, which had drawn into its vortex and ranged on opposite sides the British and the Ottoman Empires. The historical Proclamation of 18th December 1914, which changed the political destiny of Egypt, was received by the people with a feeling of relief. The long and chequered connection of Turkey with Egypt which was thus finally terminated, had at different times and in consequence of varying policies, set m motion both cohesive and disruptive forces. 1 he latter, owing chief!} to misrule and lack of political insight and foresight on the part of Egypt’s late Suzerain, had been acquiring an increasing ascendency when the British occupation of the country m 1882 profoundly altered the whole aspect ol Egypt’s future. We tried to find out whether the prosperity and progress resulting from the British connection weighed heavier in the scale with the Egyptians, irrespective of the military strength of the occupying Power which ensured the peoples allegiance, against the bonds of a common cieed and, to what extent, if any, the national sentiment of the Egyptians was influenced by cognate Islamic ideals and affected by the Turkish espousal of the German cause. In considering these points and the inter-relation of the various factors, which seem to govern the Egyptian situation, it must be remembered that the population of Egypt, especially in the urban areas, which constitute the centres of political thought and activit}, is not so homogeneous as to lie influenced in the same manner and to the same extent by recent events. ( 8 .) From a political point of view the population of Egypt, after making- due allowance for normal increase after the census of 1907, may roughly be divided in round numbers into 11,325,000 Moslem Egyptians ; -.95,000 Copts - 75,000 Turks and other Ottoman subjects; 137,000 Greeks, Italians and Frenchmen; 43,000 Jews; and 25,000 British subjects-making an aggregate total of 12,4*00,000 souls.THE MOSLEM EGYPTIANS. LU (4.) The Moslem Egyptian constitutes the bulk or over 90 per cent of tlie population and is the backbone of the national life of Egypt outside the small urban areas. He is scarcely conscious of the momentous issues involved in the War, and has always been indifferent to all political changes which do not disturb the placid stream of his religious and economic lile. He sees that the sandy and arid wastes of Egypt are being transformed into o-reen stretches of waving corn and cotton, and realises that beneficent measures for ameliorating his moral and material condition are being continuously adopted. He is aware that he enjoys complete religious liberty and that all his sacred institutions are being preserved and respected. His racial sentiment is by no means of such a nature as to make him abandon the solid advantages of good and impartial government for the oppression of pre-occupation times. THE COPTS. ( 5 .) The Copts have nothing to gain and much to lose by any change in the present state of things, and their adhesion to the British cause may be fully counted upon. It appeared to us, however, that any leaning towards the Copts by the British authorities would result in a dangerous alienation of the Moslem Egyptian’s trust in their impartiality and sense of fairnesl. We were told by many leading men that though there existed an honest desire to hold the balance even between the Moslem and the Copt, indications were not sometimes wanting that all real confidence was reposed in the latter. We did our best to convince the Egyptian Moslems that absolute impartiality was the key-note of British policy, and that their apprehensions were groundless. But we think that the necessity and importance of avoiding any action which may give rise to the slightest suspicion of racial preference for the Copt or the Moslem cannot too often be impressed upon the subordinate officials. THE GREEKS AND OTHER RACES. ( 0 .) The Greeks who are in more intimate touch with the Egyptians, even in remote and small villages, than any other European nationality, and the Italian, French, and other foreign elements in the population, reserve all their loyalty and patriotism for their respective countries. They seem always likely to swim with the tide of real power when it does not conflict with their own national interests. The attitude of the Jews seems oppor tunist and inspired with a desire to be left in peace and security. The British subjects are of course keenly pro-British. The Turks and most of the other Moslem Ottomans may be expected to be naturally in sympathy with the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire, but they are likely to remain perfectly peaceful unless some unexpected upheaval changes their quiescence. THE EGYPTIAN ARISTOCRACY. (7.) A very important and interesting factor in the policy and population of Egypt is the Albano-Turkish aristocracy composed of the descendants of Mohamed Ali and of the soldiers of fortune, who helped him to conquer the country and to build up the somewhat loosely jointed social, political, economic and military structure with which British statesmanship has come into contact. This aristocracy, which consists of about a hundred families, and is by no means exclusive owing to the democratic traditions of Islam, combined with the upper classes, which are more or less of Turkish Albanian and Circassian origin, and may be roughly estimated at about a thousand families, furnishes a large proportion of the governing forces, which, under British advice and guidance, are still predominant. Many members of this upper stratum of Egyptian society are much travelled men, who havereceived their education in Lnropean countries, chielly in .France, and are imbued in some degree with European culture, which has widened their mental horizon, though in some cases the impact of Western ideas, upon their national virtues appears to have produced undesirable tendencies. The finest example of the Albano-Turkish aristocracy is the new Sultan of Egypt, to whose personality we make a more detailed reference in a subse quent paragraph. Lapse of time and force of circumstances have greatly weakened and in many cases entirely obliterated the Turkish sympathies of these men, who have developed a limited patriotism lor the country of their birth and adoption, in whose fortunes they know that their life and well being are completely merged. The loyalty of these classes during the present crisis may be counted upon; but, we venture to suggest that their adhesion to the British cause may be strengthened by a statesmanlike policy of conciliation and of generous concessions to their sentiments and reasonable expectations. THE ASPIRATIONS OF EDUCATED EGYPTIANS. ( 8 .) Some members of the influential classes mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and also the literate classes generally, including the upper strata of educated Moslem Egyptians, especially the students, are influenced by somewhat vague ideas of nationalism and independence ; but we found that the more thoughtful and experienced men with whom we had con- versaiions were fully alive to the deficiencies of the Egyptian people in numerical strength and defensive power in the present stage of their social, intellectual, and political development, and readily recognised that they could not stand on their own legs without the help of a strong protecting hand. They clearly realised that in view of the geographical position of Egypt and the situation of the Suez Canal as a vital link in a world-chain of British interests, such effective support can only come from the direct suzerainty of Great Britain. Enlightened Egyptian opinion consequently seemed to us to be practically solid in deprecating any eventuality calculated to disintegrate the fabric of prosperity, now being raised, or to cause a break in the steady moral and material advance of the country. The Egyptian politicians, however, do not make any secret of their aspirations, which tend in the direction of autonomy under Imperial protection or an uncontrolled management of such of their internal affairs as are free from international complications. They desire a gradual straightening out of these entangle ments and a complete and immediate sweeping away of the Capitulations. We are not aware whether in deference to Italian susceptibilities or for what •other political reasons, which no doubt must be strong, the Capitulations are still maintained at ihe present most opportune juncture when their abolition might perhaps have caused the least disturbance in the international atmosphere, charged as it is with the absorbing exigencies of the War to the practical exclusion of minor questions. We understand, however, that the Capitulations are doomed to extinction at the end of the War, and to this consummation the Egyptians, we think rightly, are looking forward with confident expectation. ( 9 .) The educated Egyptians cherish the hope that the closer association with the self-governing traditions of the British nation, which has now been inaugurated, will eventually result in raising the political status of the -country to a higher plane, with a local Parliament instead of a deliberative Assembly whose legislative activities under its present constitution can be rendered inoperative. They recognise the futility of aspiring to the manage ment of their mditary and naval affairs, which must remain under the contiol of the Protecting Power; but in the matter of purely civil legislation, which cannot affect Imperial interests, the Assembly s powers, they think, should be widened within safe limits. ( 10 .) How far these expectations are within the range of practical politics it is'not for us to say, but we agree in the view that a beginning might safely be made in regard to the management of (\) the Waqfs, (ii) the[ Mahkama Shari’a, and (Hi) the Muglis Hasbi, Avhicb cpiicern endowniiieiits, ecclesiastical matters and trusteeships respectively. II this is done an excellent political effect would be produced without Meeting the essentials of British control. Idle advent of the new Sultan would be signaljsed by an innocuous but important concession to Kgyptain sentiment, and his prestige as a Protected Sovereign would be enhanced at the outset of his nde' when his attitude of steadfast loyalty to the British cause is not altogether free from certain domestic and other dilhculties. I he concession would be gratefully appreciated by all classes of the Egyptian people, and their confidence in' the motives and policy of the Imperial Government would be increased. 1 THE PROTECTORATE. dl ) The rupture of friendly relations with luikev combine d with the hostile attitude eif the Khedive Abbas II., who was repoited I 13 Sh Eouis Mallett to have co-operated with the 1 urkish Militarist party in organising a serious menace in Syria to the British position in Egypt, had bi ought to the fore the question whether Egypt should be annexed to the British Empire or whether the political status of the country should be settled in some other way. The repeated and emphatic disavowal in past years by successive British Ministers of any intention to annex the country had raised certain moral issues the settlement of which was being watched with keen interest and considerable misgiving not only by the Egyptians but also by the whole Moslem world. Annexation, we are' told, would have stirred up unfriendly feelings townrds Great Britain in many quarters, and might possibly hene led to serious complications. The constitution of Egypt into a British Protectorate at the present juncture is generally regarded as the most statesmanlike solution of a very dithcnlt and delicate problem. THE NEW SULTAN. (12.) The gratification of the Egyptians at the decision of His Majesty’s Government has been enhanced by the happy selection of His Highness Hussein Kamel as the first Sultan of Egypt. lie has a much stronger hold on the esteem and confidence of the Egyptians than the late Khedive, whose unceasing intrigues had poisoned the atmosphere of Cairo, and whose questionable monetary exploitations had created in the country and even among ids nearest relations a feeling of distrust and apprehension. The new Sultan is known for his uprightness and high sense of honour, his solicitude for the welfare of the poor, and his great interest in agricultural questions, on wdiich the prosperity of a country like Egypt must largely depend. His antecedents and Ids early association with almost all the branches of the administration, including the portfolios of Finance, War, Public Works, Interior, Waqfs and Education, inspire the people with confidence in his ability and knowdedge of affairs. We were told that if a plebiscite had been taken the choice of the Egyptians would have been the same as that of His Majesty’s Government. (Jo.) We have had opportunities of meeting and conversing with His Highness. He impressed us as a strightforward, enlightened, and broad minded man. At our parting private interview with the Sultan, arranged at his special desire, His Highness confidentially but quite frankly expressed his views on the change in the political status of Egypt, and the difficulties of his own position. We gathered from his conversation that the role of a mere ornamental figurehead on the political chessboard, which he confidently hoped was not in contemplation when he loyally assented to the proposals of the Indian Government, would humiliate him in the eyes both of the Islamic world and of his own subjects, and render his position intolerable. He expressed the conviction that, in view of his clean record and mature Expe rience, only a policy of mutual trust, confidence, and good will, coupled with a generous desire to uphold his dignity, with special regard to the powersand responsibilities attaching to the position of a Sovereign, could deepen the sense of friendly co-operation essential to the unhampered furtherance of Egyptian as well as Imperial interests. He asked us to convey to His Majesty and to the Ministers of the Crown a message of his sincere goodwill and his assurances of his faithfulness to the British connection. He added that during the present crisis and in future his unswerving loyalty in rendering all possible services to the Empire and to his country may be fullv relied upon. . We were deeply impressed by the tone of genuine sincerity which characterised His Highness conversations, and we believe that his firm adhesion to the British cause is beyond question. THE MINISTERS AND THEIR ADVISERS. (14.) From the conversations of the Ministers, with almost all of whom we had opportunities of discussing the Egyptian situation in a friendly and informal manner, we gathered that they desired a free and frank interchange of views on the advice tendered to them before it was given effect to. It was hinted that it occasionally happened that a candid examination of the advice from a different angle of view was resented and attributed to obduracy. This naturally impaired in some degree the cordiality of relations between the Minister and his Adviser, and left unpleasant impressions on the minds of both. As a consequence, the removal of an otherwise capable Minister was sometimes rendered expedient, and the impression gained ground that only those Ministers who were willing to surrender their judgments would be acceptable. This was probably a somewhat over-coloured view of the situation, but the belief undoubtedly exists m the minds oi many Egyptian politicians that freedom oi judgment is occasionally at a discount. It is fully realised that m the settlement of questions which are vital to Impeiial interests, firmness cannot be sacrificed to a hesitating desire for conciliation or compromise. It is also recognised that the effect on Butish prestige ol an uncertain and vacillating attitude in a country where the people instinctively lean towards the authority which in their belief possesses the substance of real power, must be Hilly guarded against. But in ordinaiy circumstances an unbending attitude, which excludes an unpiejudicei examination of any question, may sometimes be carried too far and produce results which m the long-run may be detrimental to Butish piestige, which can only be maintained on a foundation of justice and fair play. (15.) An atmosphere of mutual trust and goodwill which welcomes friendly and dispassionate criticism from either side, before the adminis tration is committed to any course ol action, will, it is believed, advance the highest Imperial as well as Egyptian interests and inspire the leadeis of the people with confidence. , , The above observations have no particular reference to the present body of Advisers, most of whom are held in high esteem. THE NATIONALISTS. (16.) The Nationalist movement, which aimed at the termination of the British occupation and the absolute independence of Egypt, received a check in 1907, when the ex-Khedive co-operated with Sir Eldon Gorst m repressing it. During the regime of Lord Kitchener the activities of the Nationalists were further neutralized and with greater effect by the measures he adopted. It seems, however, from what we have seen and heard in Egypt that the Nationalist spirit is not dead but dormant. The students, especially of the Law School in Cairo, and those who receive their education in foieign countries, are peculiarly susceptible to the propagandism of the Nationalists. sations (17 ) The few exponents of Nationalist views with whom we had conver- ons seemed.to think that if a policy of greater trust in the representatives6 of the Egyptians “f f l ^f c “^ rat f oi:is , the Nationalists would cordially are »o‘^,£ 1 ^ They aihnitted that the measures for suppoit the But! &lt; - ino- the material condition of the Fellah ^'fstSr s^^ '“-t i» their opinion the educational policy of naa neen biiiKiiif, . 1 u r iti s h guidance had been somewhat halt- hearte^hnd 1 fleft an impression upon their minds that a real uplifting of t people of Egypt in the scale of nations was not desired tor politics reasons, which, they urged, should not be allowed to stand .11 the way of national advancement. so be THE EGYPTIAN PRESS. (18) The Kanoun-al-Matbuat or the Press Law of 1909 has produced a 10 riim effect on the Egyptian Vernacular Press. At one time there used to he about BO Arabic papers, and nearly the same number in European languages in circulation in the country. The number of the vernacular iournals has considerably decreased recently. A ^ i The activities of the Arabic Press in Egypt were inspired and developed bv the different political parties, which under martial lav aie at piesent quiescent. The most important of these organizations are : (1. ) The Nationalist Party to which we have already referred. (2.) The Hisb-al-Umma or the People's Party ; and ( 3 .) The Islah or the Reform Party. The organ of the Nationalist Party, started in 1898 was the most important political paper of its time It was suppressed in l Its policy was inspired bv Mustafa Pasha Kamel. I he hhaab replaced the L,™ and subsequently Al-Alam.

Hie paper was at one time ably edited, and often adopted an independent attitude, ft has ceased to be of much importance now. Of the independent papers the AUAhrcun, started in KSio, is the oldest and the best. It is an exponent of moderate and reasonable views, and its policy is pro-British. T . 1 . , Al-Mokattam is another important paper. It is under the management of Syrian Christians whose policy is strongly anti-Turkish. The paper is looked upon as a semi-official organ of the British Agency, and the Moslem Egyptians, we are informed, view it with distrust and suspicion In this connection we may incidentally mention that the attitude of the British authorities towards the Syrians is being watched with some apprehension by the Egyptian Moslems. The Copts have two organs, the Misr and AJ-\\ atari, which vatcn o^ and advocate their interests. Among the European papers the most important seem to be the hyiyylian Gazette, Le Phare dAlexandric, Le Journal du Gaire, VEgypte-hgyptian Morning News and La Bourse Egyptienne. All these are exponents ot European views. i • i It appears to us from what we have heard that under the combined operation of the Press Act and martial law, the Arabic Press has to a large extent ceased to reflect the trend of Egyptian feeling in all its aspects, ihe suppression of some of the virulent papers was, however, a necessary measure at the present juncture.(19., lu regard to the Moslem attitude towards the Caliphate, the Islamic world may roughly be divided into two groups,—the great majority of Moslems who profess the Sunni or orthodox faith, and a minority composed ol Shias, Ibadhis. Kharajis, Zaidis and other minor sects. L'he question of the Caliphate concerns only the Sunnis, as the other sects have conflicting- views on the subject. The historical origin of the Caliphate is clearly traceable to the emergent conditions which called for an immediate settle ment on the death ol the founder of Islam. The first Caliph Abu Bekr was elected by the people, but he nominated before his death Omar as his successor. This precedent has been followed ever since in regard to the Caliphate, each successive Caliph being nominated by his predecessor. The Apostolic succession was maintained through various Arab dynasties until the Osinanli Sultan Selim, conquered Egypt, and induced the last Abbasside holder of that dignity to nominate him as his successor. In this manner the line of Apostolic succession by nomination lias remained unbroken until now ; and it is for this reason that the orthodox Moslems of India, Egypt and other countries look upon the Sultan of Turkey A as the rightful Caliph of Islam. Whatever the consequences of the present war may be as to territorial adjustments, it seems essential from the Sunni point of view that the guardianship of the Holy Places should rest in the hands of a Moslem Sovereign who derives his title to the Caliphate by nomination from his predecessor. The efforts of the Young Turks to rally the militant support of Islam around the Osmanli Caliphate might perhaps have met with a less frigid response if Turkish rule had not been so markedly out of tune with the spirit of the time. The progressive tendencies of the age in their bearing on the welfare and elevation of governed nationalities cannot be dissociated from the purely spiritual aspect of the Caliphate The serious risks and harassment to which the depredations of the Bedouins and the exactions of the local officials su bject the pilgrims of the Moslem Holy Places in the Hedjaz and Mesopotamia, combined with the insanitary conditions which surround them, have naturally chilled Moslem enthusiasm as to the effects of the guardianship of the Ka’ba and Kerbala by the Caliph-Sultan of Turkey. It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that the Turks are “detested ” by the Egyptians or other Moslem races. On the contrary, the traditions of the‘Ottoman Empire have never ceased to captivate the imagination and stir the sympathies of the Moslem World. But the Turks obviously miscalculated the psychological and moral limitations to which such sympathies must be subject. Apart from the question whether the Caliphate has really a religious basis or whether a claimant to that dignity must belong to the tribe of the Prophet of Islam, the expectations of the Turkish militarists that the blessings of good government, including a complete freedom of religious belief, would be abandoned at the bidding of the Caliph-Sultan were foredoomed to disappointment. It is, however, an acepted doctrine that the recognition of the Sultan as Caliph does not involve any political allegiance to him, and it is for this reason that the Moslems of Egypt and India have not wavered in their secular allegiance. But, in regard to the spiritual aspect of the Caliphate, any intervention by non-Moslem Powers as to the nomination of a Caliph is certain to be attributed to political motives, and no Caliph so nominated can be generally accepted. It would be wise to leave the solution of this delicate question to the judgment of the Moslem people, who, in course of time, will meet the situation according to Islamic traditions and doctrines. THE JEHAD FETWA. (20.) The Eetwa of the Sheikh-ul-Islain of Turkey about a Jehad or Holy War has fallen upon entirely sterile ground in Egypt. The people are quite unconcerned about it This Fetwa consists of some ciyptic “Ayes” to a series of ingenious questions formulated by the War party in Turkey. ‘The assumptions underlying some of these questions are more or less devoid S. 259.

They also thought that the Entente Powers had aggressive designs on the Moslem shrines and aimed at the destruction of Islam. At the suggestion of Generals Sir John Maxwell and \\ . son we visited the brigades commanded by Brigadier-Generals Youngbusband, Co., A. Watson, H. Watson, Geoghegan, and Melbas. W e were aoconipanie j Major-General Wilson and Brigadier-General Bingley, Chief ,^ ce ^ The troops were drawn up at their respective camps, and all the Generals and other Officers were present After the usual formalities «&gt;1 in 8 p«ttio and introduction by General Wilson, the Native Officers were assembled m groups The Aga Khan addressed them in Urdu, meeting th. miscon ceptions arising out of the Turco-German intrigues point by point according to the Shariat and Islamic doctrines.

The arrangements made in England for the benefit of Indian soldiers, and for satisfying the religious scruples of botli Hindus and Moslems were explained. The gracious solicitude of the King-Emperor for their welfare was alluded to, and a hope was expressed that they would justify the confidence His Majesty reposed in them by gloriously maintaining the traditions of the Indian Army, and by adding fresh laurels to its achievements. CONCLUSION. (23.) We are greatly indebted to General Maxwell for Ids generous hospitality. Our gratitude is also due to Messrs. Cheetham and Storrs for the numerous interviews they arranged for us. We may add in conclusion that no opportunity was missed by us of impressing upon those with whom we came into contact, the benefits of the British connection as evidenced by the present conditions in India, and of pointing out that the Protectorate had opened up a new horizon of boundless possibilities for the good of Egypt. Port Said, 12th January 1915. Aga Khan. M. A. A li Baig.I ifi\; \ f S S b j note »Y THE AGA KHAH AND M. A. ALI BAIG ON THE SITUATION IN EGYPT /c An informal expression of our views on some aspects of the political situation in Egypt, and a Brief reference to our endeavours to remove the uneasiness among some of His Majesty^ Moslem soldiers caused By the machinations of Turco-German agents, and at the same time to assist the British authorities in the formation of an atmosphere of mutual goodwill and understanding Between the representatives of the Imperial Government and the Egyptians may Be of interest to the Marquess of Crewe and Sir Edward Grey. In the course of our sojourn in Egypt from the ISth of DecemBer 1914 to the^I2th of January 1915, we travelled over a thousand miles and visited Ismailia, Suez, Port-Said, Tanta, Alexandria and also all the camps of the Indian troops. Through the courtesy of the British Agency we had frequent opportunities of discussing Egyptian proBlems, especially in their relation to the new order of things, with the leaders of all shades of political j The Attitude of the Egyptian People' mm 2 . thought ; including the Prime Minister and his colleagues, the ex-Premier Said Pasha and some ex-Ministers, the leader of the Opposition, the President of the Assembly f the members of His Highness the Sultan’s family, the represen tatives of the middle classes and of the Press, the ecclesiastics, the Ulemas and others. Our first impression, which still remains unchanged, was that except for the evidences of considerable military activity for the defence of the country, there was no outward sign that the Egyptians were in any way perturbed by the great War, which had drawn into its vortex and ranged on opposite sides the British and the Ottoman Empires. The historical Proclamation of I8th December 1914, which changed the political destiny of Egypt, was received by the people with a feeling of relief. The long and chequered connection of Turkey with Egypt which was thus finally terminated, had, at different times and in consequence of varying policies, set in motion both cohesive and disruptive forces. The latter, owing chiefly to misrule and lack of political insight and |$resight on the part of Egypt's late Suzerain, had been acquiring an increasing ascendancy when the British occupation of the country in 1882 profoundly altered the whole aspect of Egypt's future. We tried to find out whether the prosperity and progress resulting from the /.British connection weighed heavier in the scale with the Egyptians, irrespective of the military strength of the occupying Power, which ensured the people’s allegiance, against the bonds of a common creed and, to what extent, if any, the national sentiment of the Egyptians was influenced by cognate Islamic ideals and affected by the Turkish espousal of the German cause. In considering these points and the inter-relation of the various factors, which seem to govern the Egyptian situation, it must be remembered that the population of Egypt, especially in the urban areas, which constitute the centres of political thought and activity, is not so homo geneous as to be influenced in the same manner and to the same extent by recent events. Prom a political point of view the population of Egypt, after making due allowance for normal increase after the census of 1907, may roughly be divided in rovtnd figures into 11.325.000 Moslem Egyptians; 795,000 Copts; 75.000 Turks and other Ottoman subjects; 137.000 Greeks, Italians and Frenchman; 43,000 Jews; and 25,000 British subjects,- making an aggregate total of 12,400,000 souls. The Moslem Egyptian constitutes the bulk or over 90^ of the population and is The Moslem Egyptians.the backbone of the national life of Egypt outside the small urban areas. He is scarcely conscious of the momentous issues involved in the War, and has always been indifferent to all political changes which do not disturb the placid stream of his religious and economic life. He sees that the sandy and arid wastes of Egypt are being transformed into green stretches of waving corn and cotton, and realises that beneficent measures for ameliorat ing his moral and material condition are being continuously adopted. He is aware that he enjoys complete religious liberty and. tnat all his sacred institutions are being preserved and respected. His racial sentiment is by no means of such a nature as to make him^^-^” prefer the solid advantages of good and impartial government the oppression of pre-Occupation times. The Copts. The Copts have nothing to gain and much to lose by any change in the present state of things, and their adhesion to the Britisn cause may be fully counted upon. It appeared to us, however, that any leaning towards the Copts by the British authorities would result in a dangerous alienation of the Moslem Egyptian’s trust in their impartiality and sense of fairness. We were told by many leading5. men that though there existed an honest desire to hold the 'balance even 'between the Moslem and the Copt, indications were not sometimes wanting that all real confidence was reposed in the latter. We did our 'best to convince the Egyptian Moslems that absolute impartiality was the key-note of British policy and that their apprehensions were ground less. But, we think that the necessity and importance of avoiding any action which may give rise to the slightest suspicion of racial preference for the Copt or the Moslem cannot too often be impressed upon the subordinate officials. The Greeks and other Races. (6). The Greeks who are in more intimate touch with the Egyptians, even in remote and small villages, than any other European nationality and the Italian, Erench and other foreign elements in the population^reserve all their loyalty and patriotism for their respective countries. They seem always likely to swim with the tide of real power when it does not conflict with their own national interests. The attitude of the Jews seems ox&gt;portunist and inspired with a desire to be left in peace and security. The British subjects are of course keenly pro-British. The Turks and most of the other Moslem Ottomans may be expected /6 • to be naturally in sympathy with the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire, but they are likely to remain perfectly peaceful unless some ^ unexpected upheaval changes their quiescence. ■' ' V m The Egyptian Aristocracy. (7). A very important and interesting factor in the polity and population of Egypt is the Albano-Turkish aristocracy composed of the descendants of Mohamed Ali and of the soldiers of fortune, who helped him to conquer the country and to build up the somewhat loosely jointed social, political, economic and military structure with which British states manship has come into contact. This aristocracy which consists of about a hundred families, and is by no means exclusive owing to the democratic traditions of Islam, combined with the upper classes,which are more or less of Turkish Albanian and Circassian origin and may be roughly estimated at about a thousand families, furnishes a large proportion of the . governing forces, which under British advice and guidance are still predominant. Many members of this upper stratum of Egyptian society are much travelled men, who have received their education in European countries, chiefly in France, and are imbued in some degree with European culture, which has widened their mental horizon* though in some cases the impact % of Western ideas upon their national virtues appears to have produced undesirable tendencies. The finest example of the Albano-Turkish ^7 aristocracy is the new Sultan of Egypt to whose personality we make a more detailed reference in a subsequent paragraph. Lapse of time and force of circumstances have greatly weakened and in many cases entirely obliterated the Turkish sympathies of these men, who have developed a limited patriotism for the country of their birth and adoption, in whose fortunes they know that their life and well-being are completely merged. The loyalty of these classes during the present crisis may be counted upon; but ; we venture to suggest that their adhesion to the British cause may be strengthened by a statesmanlike policy of conciliation and of generous concessions to their sentiments and reasonable expectations. mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and also the literate classes generally, including the upper strata of educated Moslem t Egyptians, especially the students, are influenced by somewhat vague ideas of national ism and independence; but we found that the more thoughtful and experienced men with whom we had conversations were fully alive to the deficiencies of the Egyptian people in numerical strength and defensive power in the present stage of their social, intellectual and political development, and readily recognised that they could not stand on their own legs without the help of a strong protecting hand. The Aspirations of Educated Egyptians. ( 8 ) Some members of the influential classesThey clearly realised that in view of the geographical position of Egypt and tne situation of the Suez Canal as a vital link in a world-chain of British interests, such effective support can only come from the direct suzerainty of Great Britain. Enlightened Egyptian opinion consequently seemed to us to he practically solid in deprecating any i eventuality calculated to disintegrate the fabric of prosperity, now being raised, or to cause a break in the steady moral and material advance of the country. The Egyptian politic ians, however, do not make any secret of their aspirations, which tend in the direction of autonomy under Imperial protection or an uncontrolled management of such of their internal affairs as are free from international complications. They desire a gradual straight ening out of these entanglements and a complete and immediate sweeping away of the Capitulations. We are not aware whether in deference to Italian susceptibilities or for what other political reasons, which no doubt must be strong, the Capitulations are still maintained at the present most opportune juncture when their abolition might perhaps have caused the least disturbance in the international atmosphere, charged as it is with the absorbing exigencies of the War to the practical exclusion of minor questions.9 ^ ' We understand, however, that the Capitulations are doomed to extinction at the end of the War, and to this consummation the Egyptians, we think rightly, are looking forward with confident expectation. constitution, can he rendered inoperative. They recognise the futility of aspiring to the management of their military and naval affairs which must remain under the control of the Protecting Power; hut in the matter of purely civil legislation,which cannot affect Imperial interests,the Assembly’s powers, they think, should he widened within safe limits. (10). How far these expectations are within the range of practical politics it is not for us to say, hut we agree in the view that a beginning might safely he made in regard to the management of i/ The Waqfs, ii/ The Mahkama Hr Shari*a, and iii/ The Maglis Hashi, which concern endowments, ecclesiastical matters and trustee- ^ ships respectively. If this is done an excellent (9). The educated Egyptians cherish the hope that the closer association with the self- governing traditions of the British nation, which has now been inaugurated, will eventually result in raising the political status of the country to a higher plane, with a local Parliament instead of a deliberative Assembly, whose legislative activities, under its present /•/. i (XO) political effect would be produced without ^ affecting the essentials of British control. The advent of the new Sultan would be signalise&lt; ' by an innocuous but important concession to Egyptian sentiment and his prestige as a Protected Sovereign would be enhanced at the outset of his rule when his attitude of steadfast loyalty to the British cause is not altogether free from certain domestic | and other difficulties. The concession would be gratefully appreciated by all classes of the Egyptian people, and their confidence in the motives and policy of the Imperial Government would be increased. The Protectorate. (II). The rupture of friendly relations with Turkey combined with the hostile attitude of the Khedive Abbas II, who was reported by Sir Louis Mallet to have co-operated with the Turkish Militarist party in organising a serious menace in Syria to the British position in Egypt, had brought to the fore the question whether Egypt should be annexed to,the British Empire or whether the political status of the country should be settled in some other way. The repeated and emphatic disavowal in past years by successive British Ministers of any intention to annex the country had raised certain moral issues W*\ II. I 2 V \ the settlement of which was “being watched with keen interest and considerable misgiving not only by the Egyptians but also by the whole Moslem world. Annexation, we are told, would have stirred up unfriendly feelings towards Great Britain in many quarters, and might possibly have led to serious complications. The constitution Ox Egypt into a British Protectorate, at the present juncture, is generally regarded as the most states manlike solution of a very difficult and delicate problem. The Hew Sultan. (22), The gratification of the Egyptians at the decision of His Majesty’s Government has been enhanced by the happy selection of His Highness Hussein Kamel as the first Sultan of Egypt. He y ^ has a much stronger hold on the esteem and confi dence of the Egyptians than the late Khedive, whose unceasing intrigues had poisoned the atmosphere of Cairo, and whose questionable mone tary exploitations had created in the country and even among his nearest relations a feeling of distrust and apprehension. The new Sultan is known for his uprightness and high sense of honour, his solicitude for the welfare of the poor, and his great interest in agricultural questions, on which the prosperity of a country like Egypt must largely depend. His antecedents and his early association with almost all the branches of the administration including the portfolios of Einance, War, Public Works, Interior, Wakfs and Education inspire the people with12 . confidence in his ability and knowledge of affairs. We were told that if a plebiscite had been taken the choice of the Egyptians would have been the same as that of His Majesty , s Government. We have had opportunities of meeting and conversing with His Highness. He impressed us as a straightforward, enlightened and broad-minded man. At our parting private interview with the Sultan, arranged at his especial desire, His Highness confidentially but quite frankly expressed his views on the change in the political status of Egypt, and the difficulties of his own position. We gathered from his conversation that the role of a mere ornamental £eoTon the political chess- hoard, which he confidently hoped was not in contemplation when he loyally assented to the proposals of the Imperial Government, would humil iate him in the eyes both of the Islamic world and of his own subjects and render his position intolerable. He expressed the conviction that in view of his clean record and mature experience only a policy of mutual trust, confidence and good will coupled with a generous desire to uphold his dignity, with special regard to the powers and responsibilities attaching to the position of a Sovereign, could deepen the sense of friendly co operation essential to the unhampered furtherance of Egyptian as well as Imperial interests. He asked us to convey to His Majesty and to the Ministers of the Crown a message of his sincere goodwill and assurances of his faithfulness to (13).13. the British connection. He added that during the present crisis and in future his unswerving loyalty in rendering all possible services to the Empire and to his country may be fully relied upon. We were deeply impressed by the tone of genuine sincerity which characterized His Highness* conversations, and we believe that his firm adhesion to the British cause is beyond question. The Ministers and their Advisers. Erom the conversations of the Ministers with almost all of whom we had opportunities of discussing the Egyptian situation in a friendly and informal manner, we gathered that they desired a free and frank interchange of views on the advice tendered to them before it was given effect to. It was hinted that it occasionally happened that a candid examination of the advice from a different angle of view was resented and attributed to obduracy. This naturally impaired in some degree the cordiality of relations between the Minister and his Adviser, and left unpleasant impressions on the minds of both. As a consequence the removal of an otherwise14. capable Minister was sometimes rendered expedient, and the impression gained ground that only those Ministers who were willing to surrender their judgments would be acceptable. This was probably a somewhat over-coloured view of the situation, but the belief undoubtedly exists in the minds of many Egyptian politicians that freedom of judgment is occasionally at a discount. It is fully realised that in the settlement of questions which are vital to Imperial interests firmness cannot be sacrificed to a hesitating desire for conciliation or compromise. It is also recognised that the effect on British prestige of an uncertain and vacillating attitude in a country where the people instinctively lean towards the authority, which in their belief possesses the substance of real power, must be fully guarded against. But in ordinary circumstances an unbending attitude, which excludes an unprejudiced examination of any question,may sometimes be carried too far and produce results which in the long-run may be detrimental to British prestige, which can only be maintained on a foundation of Justice and fair play. ). An atmosphere of mutual trust and ./ n goodwill which welcomes friendly and15. H % 7S dispassionate criticism from either side, before the administration is committed to any course of action, will, it is believed, advance the highest Imperial as well as Egyptian interests and inspire the leaders of the people with confidence. The above observations have no particular reference to the present body of Advisers, moat of whom are held in high esteem. - - ■ ■ The Nationalists. The nationalist movement, which aimed at the termination of the British occupation and the absolute independence of Egypt, received a check in 1907, when the ex-Khedive co-operated with Sir Eldon Gorst in repressing it. During the regime of Lord Kitchener the activities of the nationalists were further neutralized and with greater effect by the measures he adopted. It seems, however, from what we have seen and heard in Egypt, that the nationalist spirit is not dead but dormant. The students, especially of the Law School in Cairo, and those who receive their education in foreign countries, are peculiarly susceptible to the propagandism of the nationalists.with whom we had conversations, seemed to think that if a policy of greater trust in the representatives of the people is adopted and if in the governance of the country the good of the Egyptians and their legitimate expectations as a self-respecting nation are not subordinated to other considerations, the nationalists would cordially support the British authorities. They admitted that the measures for extending cultivation and improving the material condition of the Fellah had been strikingly successful, but in their opinion the educational policy of the Egyptian Government under British guidance had been somewhat half-hearted, and it left an impression upon their minds that a real uplifting of the people of Egypt in the scale m nations was not desired for political reasons, which they urged, should not be allowed to stand in the way of national advancement. The Egyptian Press. (18). The Kanoun-al-Matbuat or the Press Law of 1909 has produced a sobering effect on the Egyptian Vernacular Press. At one time there used to be about 60 Arabic papers, and nearly the same number in European languages in circulation in the country. The number of the vernacular journals has considerably decreased recently.The activities of the Arabic Press in Egypt were inspired and developed by the different political parties, which under i Martial Law are at present quiescent. The most important of these organizations are :^ l/. The Nationalist Party to which we have already referred*tn—the—p-r-e-c-ed-ing para . 2/ The Hisb-al-Umma or the People’s Party; and- ' ‘il S/. The lelah or the Reform Party. / The organ of the Nationalist Party, Al-Le^i started in 1898 was the most important political paper of its time. It was suppressed in 1912. Its policy was inspired ty Mustafa Pasha Kamel. The Shaah replaced the Lewa and subsequently Al-Alam. The latter was also suppressed in November 1914. The organ of the Hisb-al-Umma - a pait&gt; composed of men of substance, the moderation of whose views was intended to serve as a counterpoise to nationalist activities^ is Al-Garida. The paper has dwindled in importance since the resignation of its editor Lutfi-al- Sayed, an honest journalist whose idealism was somewhat out of time with the realities of the situation in Egypt. ' The Reform Party, which identified itseli f : &lt; XJ ■''' with the policy of the ex-Khedive, ventilated its views through the columns' of Al-Koayyad. The paper was at one time ably edited, and ^ j •/•18 . often adopted an independent attitude. It has ceased to he of much importance now. Of the independent papers the Al-Ahram, started in 1875, is the oldest and the test. It is an exponent of moderate and reasonable views, and its policy is pro-British. Al-Mokattam is another important paper. It is under the management of Syrian Christians whose policy is strongly anti-Turkish. The paper is looked upon as a semi-official organ of the British Agency, and the Moslem Egyptians, we are informed, view it with distrust and suspicion. In this connection we may incidentally mention that the attitude of the British authorities towards the Syrians is being watched with some apprehension by the Egyptian Moslems. The Copts have two organs, the Misr and Al-Watan, which watch over and advocate their Among the European papers the most important seem to he the Egyptian Gazette heard that under the combined operation of interests. Le Phare d'alexandrie, Le Journal du Caire, 1 ’Egypte-Egyptian Morning Hews and La Bourse Egyptienne. All European views. enne. All these are exponents of It appears to us from what we have the Press Act J Press has to a Act and Martial Law, the Arabic to a large extent ceased to reflect A/ 19. the trend of Egyptian feeling in all its aspects. The suppression of some of the virulent papers was however a necessary measure at the present juncture. In regard to the Moslem attitude towards the Caliphate, the Islamic world may roughly he divided into two groups,- the great majority of Moslems who profess the Sunni or orthodox faith, and a minority composed of Shias, Ihadhis, Kharajis, Zaidis and other minor sects. The question of the Caliphate concerns only the Sunnis, as the other sects have conflicting views on the subject. The histor- ical origin of the Calii&gt;hate is clearly traceable to the emergent conditions which called for an immediate settlement on the death of the founder of Islam, The first Caliph Abu Bekr was elected by the people, but he nominated before his death Omar as his successor. This precedent has been followed ever since in regard to the Caliphate, each successive Caliph being nominated by his predecessor. The Apostolic succession was maintained through various Arab dynasties until the Osmanli Sultan Selim conquered Egypt, and induced the last Abhasside(holder of that dignity to nominate him as his successor. In this manner the line of ,, The Caliphate/ 20 . Apostolic succession by nomination has remained unbroken until now; and it is for this reason that the orthodox Moslems of India, Egypt and other countries look upon the Sultan of Turkey as the rightful Caliph of Islam, Whatever the consequences of the present War may be as to territorial adjustments, it seems essential from the Sunni point of view that the guardian ship of the Holy Places should rest in the hands of a Moslem Sovereign who derives his title to the Caliphate by nomination from his predecessor. The efforts of the Young Turks to rally the militant support of Islam around the Osmanli Caliphate might perhaps have met with a less frigid response if Turkish rule had not been so markedly out of t4&lt;me with the spirit of the time. The progressive tendencies of the age in their bearing on the welfare and elevation of governed nationalities cannot be dissociated from the purely spiritual aspect of the Caliphate, The serious risks and harass' ment to which the depredations of the Bedouins and the exactions of the local officials subject the pilgrims to the Moslem holy places in the Hedjaz and Mesopotamia, combined with the insanitary conditions which surround them, have naturally chilled Moslem enthusiasm as to the effects of the guardianship of the Ka’ba and Kerbala by the Caliph-Sultan of Turkey. It would, however, be a mistake to/ ( 21 ). suppose that the Turks are 'detested' hy the Egyptians or other Moslem races. On the contrary ( the traditions of the Ottoman Empire have never ceased to captivate the imagination and stir the sympathies of the Moslem World. But the Turks obviously miscalculated the psychological and moral limitations to which such sympthies must be subject. Apart from the question whether the Caliphate has really a religious basis or whether a claimant to that dignity must belong to the tribe of the Prophet of Islam, the expectations of the Turkish militarists that the blessings of good government,including a complete freedom of religious belief,would be abandoned at the bidding of the Caliph-Sultan were foredoomed to disapxjointment. It is, however, an a-ccepted doctrine that the recognition of the Sultan as Caliph does not involve any political allegiance to him, and it is for this reason that the Moslems of Egypt and India have not wavered in their secular allegiance. But, in regard to the spiritual aspect of the Caliphate,any intervention by non-Moslem Powers as to the nomination of a Caliph is certain to be attributed to political motives, and no Caliph so nominated can be generally accepted. It would be wise to leave the solution of 1/22 . this delicate question to the judgment of the Moslem people, who in course of time will meet the situation according to Islamic •traditions and doctrines. The Jehad Fetwa. (20) . The Fetwa of the Sheikh-ul-Islam of Turkey about a Jehad or Holy War has fallen upon entirely sterile ground in Egypt. The people are quite unconcerned about it. This Eetwa consists of some cryptic 'Ayes” to a series of ingenious questions formulated by the War party in Turkey. The assumptions underlying some of these questions are more or less devoid of foundation in the politico-military situation arising out of the war. This was recognised by those with whom we had opportunities of conversing. The average Moslem mind in Egypt as in other Muhanmadan countries may he influenced by religious Pan-Islamism in the event of aggressive hostility against Islam; but the intelligent classes among the Egyptian Moslems are under no delusion as to the nature of the political Pan-Islamisra inspired by German propagandists. The Effect of Earl Kitchener’s Policy. (21) . We may venture to state here that the present reassuring calm in Egypt appears to be •/.£3 &gt;v * 23 . due in a large measure to the signally successful regime of Lord Kitchener. In all directions we came across striking evidences of the firm hold he had acquired on the Egyptian mind by his sympathetic insight into its working and by his breadth of view in harmonising Egyptian advancement with the wider interests of the Empire. His policy in regard to the gradual fulfilment of reasonable national aspirations seems to have won the loyalty and goodwill of all enlightened Egyptians. The Indian Troops. (22). We were informed by Generals Wilson, Cox and Mellis that there was some uneasiness among the Trans-Erontier Moslem soldiers, u especially the Brah^is, Hazaras, Khattaks, Yusufzais, Swatis and Afridis, as to certain aspects of the war with Turkey. In the opinion of the Military Authorities Turkish ^gents were undoubtedly trying to get at the Musolman soldiers, and there was evidence to show that the trouble began even before the troops left India. The views held by these men were that they should be led against the Germans, as they were given to understand in India that the war was with Germany, instead of being asked/ 2 ^. to fight the soldiers of the Caliph - the Yemen Arabs and Turks - who were the natural guardians of the Holy Places. They seemed to 'believe that Islam x&gt;rohi'bited internecine 'bloodshed among Moslems. They also thought that the Entente Powers had aggressive designs on the Moslem Shrines and aimed at the destruction of Islam. At the suggestion of Generals Sir John Maxwell and Y/ilson we visited the Brigades commanded 'by Brigadier-Generals Young hush and, Cox, A.Watson, H.Watson, Geogahan and Mellis. Vie were accompanied 'by Ir6.General Wilson and Brigadier-General Bingley, chief Staff Officer. The troops were drawn up at their respective camps, and all the Generals and other Officers were present. After the usual formalities of inspection and introduction by General Wilson, the Native Officers were assembled in groups. The Aga Khan addressed them in t meeting the misconceptions arising out of the Turco- German intrigues point by point according to the Sheriat and Islamic doctrines. It was pointed out that Islam imposed upon them the duty of being true to the salt of the Sarkar under whose aegis they enjoyed complete religious liberty, and that accordingly in the armies of Russia and Prance thousands of Moslem swords were drawn in defence of the righteous cause for which the Entente Powers were fighting. It was impressed upon them/ 25. X that the British Sarkar had always Befriended and protected Moslem nations; that the inviolability of the Holy Places was guaranteed during and after the war by Great Britain with the concurrence of Russia and Prance; that Turkey in spite of the proffered guarantees, assurances and promises, which would have secured the safety and advanced the interests of the Ottoman Empire had been dragged into the war by Germany and a junta of Turkish chauvinists, who were entirely influenced by political reasons; and,that the war was in no sense religious as evidenced by the attitude of Indian Muhammadan Chiefs, the Ameer of Afghanistan ; and many other Moslem potentates. The recent elevation of Prince Hussein Kamel to the dignity of Sultan of Egypt was mentioned as the most recent instance of the manner in which Moslem countries were protected by Great Britain, and their Islamic traditions maintained. The arrangements made in England for the benefit of Indian soldiers, and for satisfying the religious scruples of both Hindus and Moslems were explained. The gracious solicitude of the King-Emperor for their welfare was alluded to, and a hope was expressed that they would justify the confi dence His Majesty reposed in them by gloriously maintaining the traditions of the Indian Army, and by adding fresh laurels to its achievements.26 Conclusion. We are greatly indebted to General Maxwell for his generous hospitality. Our gratitude is also due to Messrs Cheetham and Storrs for the numerous interviews they arranged for us. We may add in conclusion that no opportun ity was missed by us of impressing upon those with whom we came into contact the benefits of the British connection as evidenced by the present conditions in India, and of pointing out that the Protectorate had opened up a new horizon.-of boundless possibilities for the good of Egypt.Copy .

The two latter have, i believe actually left for Collung as it was not eonaidom expedient to stop their departure. Of the others at least three 11 Bayed Idris, 11 bayed lohananed 11 Abed, and SI Bayed Lohammed he da, have always been regarded as favouring a policy of conciliation towards the Italians, while Omar Pasha, acting on behalf of the Khedive Abbas hilmi, had actually been concerned in attempts to arrange a permanent peace between Italy and tne benussi. It is wall known that Inver Pasha, whose influence in Cyrenaica is still very great, has left no stone unturned to fhe bight Honourable dir E, Grey , Bart*, K.G., he» , i'L c *, he*to induce the Sheikh and the Western Bedouin generally to attack Bsypi, (1 need only cite the despatch of SI Laruni and the dheikh 11 duf) and it is no less obvious that any such attack could only hope to succeed if peace or at any rate the suspension of hostilities had first been brought about between the Italians and the sennasi. that the Italians have for some time past been and still are, anxious to come to terms we know for certain. The accompanying article from the Tanin, dated November 12th - it is one of several of the kind selected at ktvr n rd - shows clearly the linos on which this policy of concilia tion is to be directed from Constantinople, end directly alludes to a conference of benussi chieftains at bol 1 u«.

The role of Italy is less easy to follow. She would, I believe 1 ara justified in assuming, prefer a definite peace with the denusci. Failing that, she would doubtless like to see us embroiled with the Sheikh ourselves, partly with a view to relieving military pressure on the coast, where alone in byrenalca the Italians have gained a permanentpermanent footir^, and partly from the belief that by drawing us in t?g should bo ultimately obliged, to fi^it Italy’s battles for 1 or, A somerhat similar policy was, 1 understand, pursued by Italy in Somaliland at the time the Vad full ah* a activities against both treat britain and Italy* L'irect proof of the above there is^l admit, none, Monsieur Serra*s intrigues with the Ix-Khedive with a view to ( 1 ) the conclusion of peace between the Italians and the Sheikh Senusai, and (2) the purchase of tne rriut Railway from his highness for the purpose of linking it on to a railway scheme in Oyrenaioa are well known to you. His relations with Abbas HU mi or at any rate his adherents apparently continue, as we have been informed from more than one good source that correspondence between His Highness at Constantinople and his followers here is sent by the official Italian Mail to Rome, whence the Ministry of the Colonies forward it on to furKey. As 1 nave on former occasions alluded to the recent activities displayed by the Italian Agency, 1 need not further touch on this aspect of the question, though generally speaking it is probable that Italy has wished to keep in with Turkey so long as she thought tnat the final victory in the far was still undecided* 1 also annex a note by Mr* Jennings b ramiey, who knows the bedouins well, and though 1 sum not in entire agreement with all the conclusions arrived at, i think many of his observations are of interest, and worthy of consider) ti on* hr.

He says that the Dhelkh has seat letters to uis cousins, hi hayed Idris (now believed to be in : ecca), i;i hayed ohaiwed Reda at Jaghbub, hi hayed .;Oha.,s.ied Abed in the Fezzun district, to the heads of hawlas, to El I auhub his agent in Cairo and to Omar l asha himself ask- ing tiieta to con.e as soon as possible to attend a meeting at Galium where questions of- great importance 'ill be discussed. He says that lie does not know tne object of ids meeting but the Ihoikh is somewhat oaz'/ded as to mmt course to take in regard to certain letters which have been sent from Constantinople together with the sum of £5,0-00, which were brought to him by three Turkish officers, hi haulmb, however, who he says is an intelligent man of the world will do his utmost to put an end to the var and to advise the dheikh in the best interests of the country. If the report of this proposed meeting is true, it is a significant fact that K1 hayed Idris, El .ayed hoh&amp;mmed Heda and El hayed nohaxuaed El Abed have always been In favour of making peace with the Italians, while Uiiar Pasha has already been concerned In attempts to bring about peace between the Italian Government and the Senussi.

It is possible that aaar Pasha Kekliia and El l auliub may be awaiting the arrive! of these men before starting to meet Daruni and it would ue as well to keep him under observa tion. Bedouin agents who were sent to ^ady hatroun and tue Fayou i report that the Bedouins in both places are very anti-British, but will make no move unless tue benussi declares hostilities against Egypt in which case ti.cy would act as his advance guard. In general tney report the Bedouins in the Fayoum as rather dangerous and say that, although tue cenussi has declared neutrality, the Arabs of the Payoum and ■lady Eatrouri do not place much faith in this and hope that he will attack Egypt. They report that there are German Officers with U.e Benue si. They say that the Arabs have already buried their flour so as to be ready to take the field, but that the Arabs have no other arms than trie inferior weapons usually possessed by Bedouins. of a more favourable nature is information riven by two Benghazi Traders now in Cairo, who are assured of the pacific intentions of the Senussi towards Egypt and tiie British Government. They say that his visit to solium is for the purpose of inspecting his outposts and facili tating communication with Egypt, and that he is expected ' to lcn.ve shortly for oema. They add that there are indications that the sheikh is collecting a considerable force in Tripoli with which he proposes to recommence operations against tlie Italians in the near future. CaptainCaptain Thompson, H.A.M.C. who has just returueti from a tour in the Behera reports tli it the Bedouins appear to be perfectly quiet and that there was no indication of any unusual movsieut being afoot.J Extract from Intelligence department 4 a hsport for Lecamber 12 th, 1914, , oaert tustafa Abu Jhawa^ir, a merchant of 3ol2um and brother of Abdulla fusef Abu Ahawa^ir, arrived on the 9th instant from iollurn with lettere for aeveral merchants of Alexandria from the Jheikh 31 ienoussi and nn order for the purchase of IbO Korans, 100 Oidhas, and some musical instruments. The letters contained orders for supplies and mentioned that the merchants need not be afraid to ship them as the ienussi had assurances from the Lritish authorities that they were well disposed towards him. ustafa states that the Aenussi had 1,200 followers with hi . and a rody ^urrd of 75 horamen. aleiman £t i aruni is at Solium with Aidi Hillal, but ustafa declares that the Aheikh refuses to listen to A 1 Laruni’s intrigues and is very favourably disposed towards the Lritish# hi bar uni told lustafa that he was very much dis appointed at the course of events since his arrival in Cyrenalca. He had come on a special mission connected with hostilities against Agypt, out the Aheikli had refused to entertain his iroposale and hi d said that he was not a child whom the Turks could play with and that A haruni must either drop the subject or he off to his own country (Tri)oli proper). ..ustaf-f: says that HI Laruni aeemed very sore on the subject and was meditating going west. us taf a&lt; ustafa noticed that there ,vas some friction between the tenueai and 'll L iruni end -whenever ustafa left the former’ 3 tent tiie latter would call him aaide and aak what the Sheikh had said to hi an ?]] baruni aeiced uatafa to deliver four letters for hirr in the ^ayum, promising him a reward of £H 100 Q when he had brougiit the answers * ■ ustafa agreed as he was anxious to discover what the conspiracy was and who 11 Baruni s frienos in the Faywi were# fhe denussi, however, surprised him corainj-u;. out of hi baruni’ s tent and insisted on knowing that had t&amp;nen place between them. ustafa told him the truth whereupon the ^enussi ordered him to have nothing to do with ill baruni, adding that he was not going to tolerate any more of his intrigues. ustafa was therefore afraid to return to 31 r.aruni for the letters. The denussi has sent the two Turkish officers, i.imbaahi iarak ^ ey of the general Staff and da^i All l ey, who ho.d both joined 11 Baruni from Constantiniple, into the interior assigning each one to a different tribe in order to upset officers in the dolluo district whom the Sheikh has des patched to various posts in the hinterland, nnd Limbashi Ahmed Baua is the only Turk left at uollum now; lie is camped with SI baruni about ten minutes walk from the bheikh's tent# ustafa declares that the main object of the benusci's visit to dollum is to enquire into the serious irregularities committed by houlasim iiahat, the Commanding Officer there, who has been suspended for embezzling 500 napoleons of the revenue.

Captain Kewitt, commanding the post at &gt;ollum, states that there have been daily arrivals of Arabs from the bast to the hanussi’s camp in response sent to letter sent to the Sheikhs of bawl as ordering them to provide as any men ana provisions as possible. Captain Hewitt com. eats on the report submitted by hr. Jennings i ramley on this subject which states that the i ecluins had -ace various guesses as to the reason of this order which mm of them undoubtedly attributed to an intention to attack gypt. Captain Hewitt is of opinion that this idea was probably out into their heads by a man like Jul eiman T 1 bar uni, Sheikii iuf and others, who have passed throu r ji the country and with whom the wish was father to the thought. He does not think tnat tnis measure indicates any hostile intention towards 'Igypt and cells to mind a request mace to him some little time by the Sheikh that he woulc, stop 'hi Arabs attempting to go from est to %asb. He adds Lnat soldier ing is not popular with the Arabs in question who will doubtless return to their homes at the earliest opportunity end take good care in future to remain out of reach ; f pny such forced enlistment. Captain Hewitt confirms the information given by ustaPa Abu Shawagir to the ef fect thrct ulazim ihat is trouble with the denussi on account of his dishonesty.

(The Turks wishing to incite the denussi against the Italians so that the influence of this family might aid their cause). Lor instance, 1 was told, by some of the : arabi belonging to &gt;idi Ahmed, that the Italians after taking certain wells, offered to let the I eduin to whom they belong return, if, mnong other conditions, they would bring in a certain number of women for the use of their men. e know that the Italians are doing all they can to conciliate the beduina so that they may get revenue from the hence this must certainly e false information pub lished by the Turks to excite the leduins against them. Tidi Ahmed, according to A] Hag ;i Ali, is a man ready to accent most people at taeir own valuation to begin with, but absolutely unforgiving if once received. both: oth the Afghan and Hajji Ali told ..e they lived, wiiile til Sidi Ahmet, in dread of his beinj murdered by some Leduin paid by the Italians, as anyone go in f ; with a story of having deserted from the Italians, or having sniped some Italian, was at once allowed to come in to ^idi Ahmed without any precautions be in,; taken and was generally varded on the strength of his assertion without the smallest trouble being taken to investigate his story« if didi Ahnied is greatly influenced, as i believe, by personal feelings, how do we stand with him now, in compari son to the Turks? The Turks gave him 'nver, and Anver, by ids personal bravery and personality, has certainly made for himself a place next only to ^idi Ahrned, with the Beduins of tne ^ost. /here his tent stood the Arabs have built a osque* fwict he left them for Turkey* Hie success there, tne officers sent by him, and the money sent by him, have nept his fame among the. as fresh as on the day he left* e have, to counteract this personal influence now directly against us, 'Koyle* . How Hoyle has been able to obtain the influence he has over ddi Ahmed is very aston ishing when we consider how little he has had to work with. fhct he has made for himself a real friend of iidi Ahmed is undoubted* noyle has obtained this friendship by his treatment of and sympathy with Aulad Ali, since midi Ahmed knows him very little personally, 1 think I am right in saying that noyle visited hidi Ahmed once for a day at Jaghbub, ano again the other day f t Mesaad, but not otherwise* iidi Ahmed, when he saw him, must have formed a personal liking, but the basis of this friendship can only be put down to a sense of obligation to Hoyle for his sympathy and treatment of Aulad Ali, and the aid he has ceen allowed to render the jenussi by the passing through of food stuffs. Butint if 3idi Ahmed ia influenced by the good in his nature by the obligations to . oyle, ho?/ much more onould he be influenced by hie obligations to Inver, iiow much more should he be influenced ny his obli.jatione to Turkey who supplied the money for the foodstuffs which we only allowed of his obiigsLions to Turkey by Mver’s officers- Added to this, there is the great influence of religion to bias him to the sice of Turkey* In all probability, therefore, an ap peal from Turkey to fight will outweigh the friendship to Koyle and the advantages a policy of pease ?dth us would ensure. The effect of this ?&gt;s far as Tg/ot is concerned would not add in the least to fanatical feeling. Outside the Aulad Ali and some I arasa and Harabi in the ayum, it would not craw to the cause of turkey one man who has not already he mi, jit influence Ali Dinar to make trouble, out i do not know the extent of his influence there, i only know that there is a certain amount of com uni cat ion going on bet /een bidi Ahmed end Ali Dinar. 1 heard of this formerly 1 heard of this again at barani as far as Tgypt is concerned therefore the effect of Sidi Ahmed joining the cause of Turkey is li ited to the number of men he can raise. It is very difficult to estimate numbers by i eduin accounts, as they have no idea what numbers mean, but if we consider the number of tribes concerned and the enormous acreage required by one man to ( graze his flocks on in the desert, the number at the disposal of didi Ahmed cannot be very large. to pass through our countiyT is he not constantly re winded been secured to the cause of the.t country uy intrigue.

Therefore-, the value of the ienussi a^^ainst us is 25,000 not very -tell trained out good fighting men. 3ince Inver Pasha left the Beduin Army, by accounts from all the Arabs at 3idi Larani, the financial affairs of the 3onussi are in a very bad way - money run through to the &gt;heikh where possible was handed by him to the oheikh Zawias, and, according to the Arabs, most of the Sheikh 2 awias distributed it to themselves.

(Similar letter sent toi mlrf Confidential December 7 t 1914 Dir: It nay perhaps oe of interest to review briefly our recent relations with the Sheikh Senussi and the result of B^nbashi iioyle’s two interviews which took place at the end of last month. The meeting betv/een hin and Bidi Ahmed was of a non~committal character and, as you will consequences. Its importance perhaps lay mainly in the fact -hat at so critical a moment on the verge ol the ll e first interview as reported in ny telegram ! :o.276 of the 30th ultimo, was unsatisfactory inasmuch as Bidi Ahmed declined to discuss atters unless bashl Coyle produced a letter shying that he had been duly authorised by his Coven; do so. This refusal was all the more unreasonable as the officer in question had gone to meet the Sheikh at the latter’s own request, and had moreover for some years past bee employed on t* e western frontier of Tgypt where he is a great favourite of the Bedouins and indeed enjoys the unique distinction of being the only luropean on whom Bidi Ahmed has ever been known to bestow a robe of honour. B^nbashi. ’oylc himself did not however attack ub much importance to the somewhat t onole. Bir . hrey art., k.b., . - ., have gathered from ny telegrams, had not any immediate outbreak of war with Turkey the Bheikh i;enussi should have wished to meet an /uiglo-Mgyptia official at all. etc., etc. etc..somewhat; curt reception accorded him as we did here where rumours had arrived simultaneously of a consid erable concentration of the sheikh 'b followers near Solium and of symptoms of unrest among the Hgyptinn iedouins, more especially among those in and about the '’ayoum. BUhoashi foyle accordingly returned to Cairo -vhere he was given a letter for the Sheikh copy of which I have the honour to enclose, and pro ceeded forthwith to bollum where he again saw liidi Ahmed ( see my telegram Ho.290 of the 26th ultimo ) who this time received him in a more courteous manner and professed his indifference towards ‘furkey aid A hi? J**L*tLL**L / 9? Bribed Cemany alike K He also ^ave him a civil if somewhat vaguely i -orded letter to the General Officer Comand- ing and nynelf cony of which I alno beg to enclose. As I have already said, SBriDaeM goyle was not unfavourably impressed with the Gheikh's attitude at the first interview which lie said was quite in accordance with bedouin manners and methods and which may have been due partly to a wish on the part of Gidi Ahmed not to make himself cheap and partly to a genuine measure of annoyance at our frontier policy with regard to the passage west of persons and pro visions. ‘’or instance the Sheikh*s doctor had, it apnears, been stopped by the gyptian officials and though he was subsequently allowed to proceed the incident had undoubtedly annoyed him* The whole question of the pas*-are of provisions in moreover, as I have on more than one occasion pointed out,to-day than «he wan before the outbreak of the great war to carry on a successful policy of aggessiofl in iripoli and Cyrenalca.tiid this fact is not likely to have escaped the notice of so shrewd an observer as Sidi /dried who, it must no$ be forgotten, has sworn never to make peace with Ms enemy. That a section of his followers are in favour of arriving at dome form of modus vivendi with the Italians may be on additional reason for his resuming hostilities at a moment when his chances of victory are probably brighter than they ray be at a later date. At the same time there is no doubt that great efforts have been made by means of Turkish and German / agents to win the Sheikh over to their side and there is 1 1 always the religious aspect of the question to be con sidered. itirther, these agents have unquestionably been S intriguing with the iigyptian Bedouins in the western ) desert, who look to the Sheikh Semins! for guidance, and there are indications of a certain restlessness among \ them. Any chenge of attitude on the part of Gidi Ahmed i might therefore cause trouble in Egypt itself. To sun up the situation, it would appear that both the Sheikh Benussi and the Bedouin tribes over whom he exerts his religious influence may be said to be sitting on the fence. If the situation remains favour able to the British cause, it Is most improbable that they will adopt a hostile policy which would be obviously i detrimental to their interests, but should the general •» situation develop unfavourably for us, v/e must be prep- pared for a quite different attitude on the part of the uheikh and hie followers. Hence while there appears to bebe no cause for immediate apprehension, it is necessary to keep as closely as possible in touch with the state of Reeling among the western Bedouins and to maintain a careful watch on our western frontier.

No. 183. (79d32) CAIRO, November 23rd, 1914 Sir: - I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of an interesting report which has been drawn up by Mr. Philip Graves, late Times Correspondent at Constantinople, regarding Turkish military preparation and political intrigues having an attack on Egypt as their object. 1 have, &amp;c., (Signed) Milne Cheetham. The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P., &amp;c ., &amp; c., &amp;c.Report Re Turkish Military Preparations and Political Intrigues having an attack on Egypt as their obj ect. 10th November, 1914. P. P. Graves. . l ir ltt r . 1 , ft .. A. Turkish Force s in Syria . Towards the end of October the writer was informed that the Turkish forces mobilised and partially concentra ted for the eventual advance on the Suez Canal consisted of: - a. The two divisions of the 8 th (Damascus) Corps, viz. the Damascus and Haifa divisions. These should number on a war footing 22 or 23 battalions of infantry, from a brigade to a brigade and a half of ca.valiy , and some 12 field and mountain batteries of four guns each. b. A division composed of surplus reservists, etc. called the Home division, and probably composed of 3 four battalion regiments. c. Arab irregulars of the Howeytat, Ibn Injad, Beni Atiyyeh Beni Sakhr, Adwan and similar tribes. d.d. Contingents of Arab and Kurd 'Hamadieh' irregular horse, best described as undisciplined mounted riflemen officered mainly by tribal leaders from the Urfa arid perhaps the Mosul regions, Milli and Karagetchi Kurds and perhaps some Shanmar and other Arabs would probably compose the bulk of this force. A Turkish division in peace is as a rule composed on paper of 3 two battalion regiments of infantry and a rifle battalion. On mobilisation a third battalion some times described as a 'cadre battalion' , sometimes as a 'depot battalion' might be added to each regiment y/hile the Amy Corps of two divisions would receive one or two reserve rifle battalions as Corps troops. Strength in peace from 300 to bOO per battalion according to station, in war from 750 to 850 men. The mobilisation scheme of 1914 does not seem to have provided for the formation of Reserve Divisions though to each Army Corps district were attached a varying number of Reserve Commands. It had been generally supposed that the Reservists would be drafted as the need arose into active battalions in s case of war, the 'Redif' battalions having beenbeen both inefficient and under officered during the camapign of 1912-1913, end the period of service in the Reserve of the Active Amy having been extended to the 18th or 20th year after first joining the Colours by the 1914 Military Law. The Home Division is probably composed of Reservists of the Damascus, Haifa and Beirut reserve commands, and perhaps, too, of reserve formations belonging properly to the 6 th Amy Corps (XYIth and XXVIth Divisions) which is in peace time stationed in the Adana and Aleppo regions, but is now quartered in the South of Thrace. In any case it is worth noting that the Turkish Battle Order has never corresponded with paper schemes, that corps are sometimes above and sometimes below their paper strength, that regiments are by no means always to be found in their normal stations even in peace time and that corps are often drafted for political reasons from one region of the Empire to another. Thus while the normal proportion of Turks to Arabs in the Damascus Amy Corps amounts to about 25%, the writer has no doubt at all that many Damascene and Haifa Arab soldiers have been drafted into regiments now quartered in Thrace and their places in the 8 th Amy Corps filled by AnatolianAnatolian Turks and Kurds. Towards the end of October it was generally believed in Constantinople that the advance on the Canad , if made at all, would De made oy way of Akaba. This may, however, have been put about with the object of mislea.ding the Anglo- Egyptian military authorities. The Beduin s. The Treaty providing for the co-operation with the Turkish forces of the Howeytat and of subordinate tribes was signed in the third week of September by Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, one of the most dangerous and determined members of the Committee of Union and Progress and Emir Ali of the distinguished house of the Abdel Kaders of Damascus on behalf of the Ottoman G-overnment, and by the Suliman Pasha, chief of the Howeytat clan. This agreement is said to have provided for the arming of the Arabs by the Government and the local authorities did indeed provide some 10,000 arms from lances and horse- pistols to ancient Martinis, but these did not satisfy the Howeytat and urgent messages for more rifles and ammunition were sent to Constantinople early in October. There is reason to believe that a certain number of breech-loading anda.nd magazine rifles were railed from the Taurus terminus of the Anatolian-Baghdad Railway a.bout that date. It is needless to say much concerning the military incapacity of any large Beduin force. Whether troops (Camel Corps or Mounted Infantry) or Ledums from the Hedjaz are to be sent to the Turco-Egyptian frontier I do not know. There are ordinarily about 10 battalions in Hedjaz and a battalion or two of Gamel Corps troops and 'Siyaras' (Mounted Infantry). Go-operation on the part of the stronger Hedjaz tribes - e.g. the Beni Harb, The Kurd irregulars are reputed better fighters tha the Beduin and have mostly magazine (Mauser) rifles. AIa Turkish artillery in Asia is weak; many of the old B.L. ba-tteries not having been yet replaced by the Krupp Q.F. It is possible that some Kurd, Turk and Circassian ' fedais*', i.e. political adventurers whose chief object is the commission of atrocities and political crimes may be attache© to the Turkish forces. They are bandits of the worst sort and should have no quarter since though they wean an uniform they are innno sense under the control of the Regular Army, but fight for the honour and glory of with the Government, would seem doubtful. thethe C.U.P, and to fill their pockets, NOTES HE THE TURKISH ARMy . The writer whose only military knowledge is derived from reading and service in a public school and later an University volunteer Corps, gives the following results of his own observations and impressions with a natural diffidence. He believes that the Turkish soldier is no better or worse than most peasant militias or short service armies as far as natural abilities for warfare are concerned^ He is perhaps superior to some in his power of taking punish ment when on the defensive. The Balkan war has taught him to neglect no chance of entrenching. He is hardy till he falls seriously ill when he nearly always dies; hospitals being regarded in rural Turkey as places whither to retire when all hope is gone. He is capable of covering long distances in a go-as-you-please way, but his march discipline is not good and battalions tail over a long stretch of ground. His physical needs are easily satisfied with dirty water, rice and bread, and he is not at all a bad manager of transport animals. It may therefore be supposed that his mobility is greater than his insufficient equipmenteo A uipment would lead one to expert* As for his fighting capacity, while he possesses plenty of passive courage and will come doggedly on when well led, he has not the wits as a rule to react quickly to any new impression, is clumsy with his own bayonet and very much afraid of the enemy’s; if a Kurd, dislikes artillery, if a Turk, spoils what he gains by good spade work by getting up and strolling about his trenches, and if an Arab, is prone to sudden and violent panic unless well led* The initiative of the Asiatic Turk is much less than that of the Rumiliot or Albanian. Confidence in the regimental officers is often lacking in consequence of the frequent cowardice and misbehaviour of the latter in the recent war. The Ron- commissioned-officers have sometimes considerable influence on the men, but trained Non-commissioned-officers are not yet numerous enough. On the other hand it must be said that at the capital and et provincial centres where there are uernians much more has been done in the way of daily training than was the case before 1912, and the men shake out very quickly into extended order and though.slow and shambling iel lows taketake an interest in what is happening. Shooting as far as I have seen it, is at a fixed target at 200 - 500 metres and is poor. Outpost and night work may be confidently expected to be deficient. In taacedonia the fall of night was the signal for the suspension of any pursuit and sentries grow veiy sleepy towards 2 a.m. Turkish Patrols of cavalry and infantry are more efficient musically than tactically, unless the patrol contains Circassians, who are not at all bad scouts. ihe officers are usually of inferior physique to their men and often seem to belong to a different world. They are more often than not urban people, sons of 'Moslem Levantines ’ 1 sharper and quicker than the real country Turk, but more nervous and excitable, and prone to indiscipline than the latter. They are harder worked now and some of uhe btaff Officers are said by the German Mission to be gooo, but the regimental officers are inferior. Politics have done much to injure the esprit de corps of the officers, and Enver Pasha has made even more political promotions than-his predecessors. Of course one sometimes comes acioss hard, tough and well set up Albanians, Circassians andand up-country Turks in the commissioned ranks, but the above description applies as a genera] rule. Theory is still said to be more honoured than practice by the artil lery. There is no large aristocratic class to give its tone to the officers and, owing to this and the combined effects of revolutionary theories and the educated Turk’s frequent mental arrogance, discipline and obedience to orders are not what they should be. In this respect the Turk’s officers compare ill with those of his neighbours. Taking the Turkish Army as a whole, I should say it was militia only moderately trained and composed as a rule of tough, but slow witted peasants as liable to panic before the unexpected as most uneducated men and by no means given to fighting cleanly. White flag incidents, faked negotiations to gain time, etc., are to be expected by those who meet them and any officer who leaves his wounded about may expect to find some of them blind or mutilated in Pathan style, unless ruthless reprisals are threatened and instantly carried out in case of infraction of military usages. The Christians in the Turkish Army will fight without any heart at all if indeed they are employed against us.f\^ Further Notes re Turkey's Military and kindred Preparations. Aviation . There has been a fair development of Aviation at '-.onstcintinople during the past twelvemonth, and despite its frequently fatal consequences, the flight to Egypt arosed much interest in flying. It has been difficult since last July to watch the work of the Ottoman fliers at the San Stefano Gamp and the writer cannot fom any opinion as to the number of efficient machines now in the hands of the Turks. I have seen three machines of different types at Uonstantinople since August 1st. One Meriot monoplane, one biplane flying at a great distance, and an hydroplane, said to be of British manufacture. The last was flown by Captain de Ooys, the French Instructor to the aviation school at San Stefano. It was generally believed at Constantinople that the Turks a. ter buying about 10 Bleriot and Depurdussin machines in late 191b had also invested in two Grennan machines and a dirigible non-rigid vessel of Oerrnan construction - part, itit was said , of some bankrupt stock - and thateuhas been talk of tne purchase of Taube and Rumpler machines in Germany. There was to be a shed for dirigibles at Adrianople, but 1 have personally never seen a Turkish dirigible about nor met anyone who has. Not a few of the Turkish aviators handle their machines boldly, but I have never seen any land except with a considerable thud. . At machine work they cannot be expected to be much good. Most of their machinists during the Constantinople-Cairo flight were Jews and Armenians who ioil owed the flyers in special trains or by steamer and picked them up at their principal halts. Uniforms. The uniform adopted during the last three or four « years is a khaki, often identical in colour with that worn by the territorials here, sometimes of a decidedly greener shade. The regulation head-dress is now a sort of peaked cap.make of a long strip of cloth. This might easily be mistaken for a helmet at a distance. But since the general mobilisation there has been nothing very uniform about Turkish uniforms, or footwear. The dark brown tunic with red piping (Redif) various shades of khakikhaki and even blue may be seen among the troops outside the capital. I saw men in blues who were not gendarmes on the Bulgar frontier on 31st October. The gendarmes wear blue (dark) with a dark blue kalpak at Constantinople but when Inwas last in Syria (1910) I saw many wearing a light blue resembling the colour of the usual fellah galabiyeh. Civil police wear stone grey with dark trousers piped with red. Military police can be dis tinguished by a crescent shaped brass badge worn across the front of the tunic. As for foot-gear ankle-boots, high-boots, shoes with putties, shoes with leather gaiters, soft 'tcharyks” (sandals) with soft gaiters, every sort in fact of covering may be seen. The C«U.P. and its Pan-Islamic Activities. This important organisation which is behind the present Turkish Government cannot be described in brief nor is any such description necessary here. It need only be said that it is an extraordinarily plastic body with all sorts of Sub-Committees, Councils, Local Committees, etc., and has what might be described in commercial language as subsidiary companies in the shape of Islamic Associations,— Associations, Red Crescent, Scientific Societies, “Fleet Committees” (Navy League) and Masonic Lodges. It contains mne of every description - chiefly belonging to the more or less educated classes, but at times recruited from small farmers or uneducated Hodjas (Alims). The character of its members differs as much as their origin. The whole organisation is based on what may be described as the pyramidal system, linked groups with “guides” (yoldjis) forming local organisations, local organisation chiefs forming groups representing districts, district represen tatives forming provincial councils, etc. The Central Executive Committee is the highest power in the organisation. The composition of this body changes annually, but it may be remarked that the “Central Committee” out of which the Central Executive is chosen has for the last three years become steadily more and more revolutionary and Pan-1 siamic. The members are oath-bound and death is the penalty for grave acts of treachery. The Committee carries out death sentences by means of its fedais (devotees), of whom some are religious or political fanatics while others are criminals pardoned on condition that they throw in their lot withwith the Organisation. Tomen are much used for purposes of espionage. Some are prostitutes, others are 'toquees ' 1 , i such as the Honourable Ilrs. C., Mademoiselle V, M., (once , \ ijb v o s m Paris, but now it is reported no longer in touch with the organisation). There is said to be a system of grips and passwords but the writer doubts very much whether these are now known by the less important members of the organisation which has been joined by most of the blackguards of Turkey. On the other hand a fair number of the more important members of the Committee are Freemasons of a sort that is not recog nised by British Lodges by which the Turkish Grand Orient has been described as ‘'spurious'. The extreme naivete of English Freemasons makes it important that they should be made aware of this. Otherwise 'brothers' from nowhere in particular may conceivably obtain information of value to the Committee from worthy Non-commissioned-officers or prisoners may attempt to work upon the sympathies of their captors by the exhibition of grips and signs. The corres pondence of the more important C.U.P. organisations bears the characteristic Masonic Devices, the compasses and inter penetrating triangles: this last a characteristically JewishJewish device. All Turks who profess themselves Freemasons of the Jrand Orient of Turkey should be regarded with the utmost suspicion and are in most cases persons of some stauding in the C.U.P. Similar suspicion should be extended to the Jews of Constantinople, Salonika, Macedonia and other Balkan regions, Syria and Smyrna. Many of these belong to the Masonic Lodges and nearly all are in more or less sympathy with the Turk as against the native Christian, the Hellene, Roumanian and Slav. Moreover, the fact that / ' what may be described as the financial and business line of communications of the Ottoman Jews leads from Constantinople and Salonika to Budapest and Frankfort renders many Turkish and Balkan Jews singularly amenable to Austrian, Magyar and Jerman influences and promptings. Turkish and Balkan Jews m Kgypt require much watching, not that they are likely to be dangerous in themselves, but their services are likely to be employed as carriers of messages and letters, panic mongers, etc., etc., Of the principal members of the C.D.P. who are likely to interest themselves particularly in Egypt I may mention anc describe a few. Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, former private physicianphysician to the Heir Apparent and now a member of the Central Committee is a dangerous and determined Circassian, blue eyed, well dressed, pleasant of speech, a crafty and ruthless man. He is singularly Northern looking, might be taken for a Scandinavian and generally wears a beard, long and fair, on campaign. He will probably be found in the Red Crescent attached to the Turkish Arny proceeding against Egypt and will do less medical than military work therein. Should, if captured, be most closely watched, as he is certain to intrigue as did Dr, Nasim at Salonika for the escape of prisoners, etc. Reference has been made in a previous report to his employment afj the Porte’s envoy to the Howeytat Arabs. Sheikh Shawish is well known to Egyptians, but, less perhaps is known here of the equally dangerous Sheikh Salih et Tunisi. This person was Enver Pasha's Arabic tutor. Was with him in Cyrenaica and seems to have stayed some time previously at Alexandria. He is a very dangerous unscrupulous and ambitious man, had much to w ^h the infamous proceedings agaunst Aziz Ali El Masri and was said to be in touch when at Constantinople with one Baruni(? Suleiman el Earuni ex LLP. for Tripoli) an Arab leader still in the field against the Italians. IsmaiL Hakki formerly one of the Ottoman High Com- missariat is well known here. He is believed at Con stantinople to be an active Pan-lslamic organiser. Otner persons whose names I have not heard of at Constantinople as having been active in Egypt are Dejelal Be y married the sister of Prince Aziz Hassan, Prince Aziz himself and one of Fakhry Pasha’s sons Gaafer Fakhry, wno was for some time in close touch with Dr. Omar Bey (Nolan) both being employed in the secret police. But my information re F. is decidedly contradictory. While at Constantinople I received (last July or August) a visit from a certain Hamid Bey Bassil of the Fay yum. This person who brought me a warm letter of intro duction from a British official soon began in conversation to discuss the case of Aziz Ali el Masri and it did not take me long to discover by the language that he used con cerning this and other subjects that he was a warm and indeed fanatical admirer of Hnver and the extremists. I understand that he is now under supervision. As to the statements of secret agents, prisoners, etc., the organ!-organisation, stc. of the C.U.P, ot would be well to remember that the lower ranks as a rule have very little idea of the organisation, plans and even of the composition of the higher groups. Only men belonging to the Masonic Lodges and the higher sub-divisions of the Committee know much. Information is however often obtainable from the higher ranks of the Armenian Secret Societies. Lashnakists, Hintchak, etc., who understand the C.U.P. very well. Macedonian Bulgar Committees are at times well informed and it might be well for the Egyptian Grovemment to send agents, not Creeks on any account, to Sofia and Bedeagateh, the only Turkish bolt-holes now iB, existence. There some thing might be discovered, since Turkish agents repairing to Europe would necessarily pass through either of these towns. Information might there be gathered concerning the state of affairs in Turkey and the plans of the Coirmittee which might have an important bearing on military operations.2 In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. and address- The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

It would appear that it was through an indiscretion on the part of the Geneva Authorities that permission was granted to Dr. Parodi to see these documents as when 1 applied by telephone to the Political Department for leave to inspect them the Procureur-General replied that it was against Gwiss practice to show such papers. You will see that part of the conspiracy was a some what vague and wild scheme of action against British Indie including the assassination of officials and an extensive propaganda.

There made the acquaintance of the leading Committee of Union and Progress-Turks by whom she was taken up. Stayed for some time in the house of Hadji Adil Bey, Vali of Adrianople and one of the Young Turk leaders. Afterwards began to repeat conversations relative to Turks and Turkish politics which she had heard at w at homes' etc. to Ministers. Was sent to Hlgypt by the Turks, by whom she was possibly paid, early in 1914. On her return thence proceeded to Albania on a mission to Essad Pasha Toptan and was expelled by the Albanian Government as a Turkish spy. While in Athens on her way to ‘Albania was in con stant touch with the Ottoman Minister Ghalib Kemali Bey. v On her return from Egypt spoke much of her work for the Turks and of her efforts to cause an agitation against Lord Kitchener. Boasted that she had secured the services of{ IMY) of a British official in the IS^ptian Grovemment who had furnished ner with certain papers which were of import one e * to the Young Turks, Was in Constantinople in July 1914 when she caused further annoyance to British residents by repeating conversations, etc., etc. It is unnecessary to say that most of what she told the Turks was garbled. Remained in close touch with the Young Turks and was especially with Enver, Talaat, Jamal and other extremists. Was presented with valuable star and crescent earrings by certain leading members of the Committee of Union and Pro gress. Paid much attention to naval and military affairs, 7/as banned at the British Embassy, where she was regarded as a Young Turkish spy. She had already been warned to make no attempt to return to Athens, In August was seen 4 in company of members of German military mission, Germany and England being then at war. Attended military manoeuvres in the company of the Minister of War, Enver Pasha, and Liman von Sanders Pasha. In early August suggested going to England via Austria, and expressed a wish that an English correspondent then in Constantinople should accompany her, which he prudently declined to do, warwar being on the point of breaking out with Austria- Hungary. This su^;estion of hers aroused much suspicion among those who hah till then been inclined to acquit her of all but sheer folly. Left Constantinople in September for Sofia on a mission for Talaat Bey. I r* Bourchier, '■'Times*' corres pondent at Sofia, could probably obtain information re her doings there* Remained a short time in Sofia and then returned to Turkish territory (Adrianople), one thence made her way to Sgypt Bade remarks, before the General sent for her, tending to arouse the belief that sre had obtained information of his intentions.

Officially the reason of his expulsion is given as the publication of certain pamphlets tending to violate Swiss neutrality. Recently I had the honour to forward to you a pamphlet on the degeneration of England, published by one Hoffmann under his auspices, (see Despatch No. 173 of the 2nd instant). The works published by the Young Egyptian 'Patriots” in Geneva are usually so foolish that it would never have occurred to me to ask for Dr. Hifoat * s expulsion. Still, as the Federal Council have acted on their own initiative, the departure of Dr. Rifaat is in no way to be regretted as he is a mischievous if rather futile person.

Stringent measures, in addition to those already prepared, have been taken to deal with anything of the kind, 1 think that ?/e have succeeded in tracing the Bedwin Sheikh to whom Mors refers in his statement. No information has, so far, been extracted from the Egyptian officer, Hamuda, but it is probable that he will be more communicativecommunicative at the Mors trial by Court Martial which is taking place to-day. There is no douot that an organised cornpaign is now in progress throughout the country, carried on by iinks tind their sympathisers with any German encouragement available, in order to estrange public opinion from the British, and that this campaign has met with a certain degree of success. ihe difficulties placed in the way of the pilgrimage by the authorities, the strong pressure exei ciseo. to collect the taxation, the fact that scarcely any cotton is being sold and the prohibition on the export of cotton abroad, are all being used to stir up pub! ic . feeling against us. Everything possible is being done to counteract this propaganda, but it cannot be denied that Egyptian feeling is not so good as it was a week or ten days ago. Changes, in sentiment here occur very quickly and with little provocation, and too much importance must not be attached to the present instance / of the mutability of the Egyptian temperament. (Initialled) R.G.Mulazim Awal Robert ^.ors recalled and re-examined, states:- I arrived in Constantinople on the evening of the 4th September 1914 and put up at the Hotel Germania. I met Hr. Curt Priifer there and he introduced me to Omar Fauzi Bey, the Turkish Staff officer, who asked me to call upon him at the War Office. I did so on the 6th September. He questioned me on the state of Egypt and on the chances of success of a native rising in this country. He men tioned that the German diplomatic and consular officials had been expelled and that all German subjects had been arrested and were to be deported. He also asked me if 1 knew Mr. Dumreicher, who, he declared, had also been sent out of the country. He stated likewise that he had heard that the Egyptian Army and Police had been disarmed and asked me if it were true, to which I replied that I thought it was very improbable. He then told me he had emissaries in Egypt fomenting trouble, to prepare the way for a Turkish invasion and to compel the British to split up their forces. In reply to my enquiry, he explained thatthat two bands of native marauders were to be organised in each Mudiria, to attack the railway and commit outrages on the property of British subjects, etc. These bands were to be recruited from the malefactor class and there would be a Turkish officer in every province to direct their operations. Each band would be composed of from ten to fifteen men and when an important 'coup’' was con templated in any Mudiria the two bands would unite, the idea being to oblige the British to scatter their forces all over the country. Fauzi Bey said he had a list of fifty Egyptian Army and Police officers from whom he expected either active or passive assistance. Four strong bands of Bedwin were also being formed to operate in the Suez Canal Zone, two East and two West. Each band was to be fifty strong. Fauzi Bey made a rough sketch of the canal to explain to me the “role” of these Bedwin. He said the British had detached posts at intervals along the canal. Two of the most isolated of these would be attacked simultaneously and if possible annihilated. The intermediate posts would then go to their assistance whereupon the third and fourth troops of Bedwin would raidraid the weakened points and fire on the steamers in the canal., The instructions given to the bands were to retire into the desert if the post attacked was strongly reinforced and then to return and attack another post, etc* Fauzi Bey asked me if 1 would help to carry out these plans and suggested that I should assist a Turkish officer who was already in Alexandria to carry out these '‘Comitadji M operations in that district. If not, I could h take part in some way in the military operations to be undertaken in Egypt. I replied that as an officer 1 Ki could have nothing to do with the ' comitadj i’’ part of his j programme, which from a German point of view, was beneath the dignity of an officer, but that I was quite disposed rr-i v , I* to participate in military operations against Egypt on condition 1st. I was granted the rank of officer in the Turkish Army; 2nd. that the German Ambassador approved of my decision and brd. that 1 was not required to start before my family arrived from Egypt. At this stage of our conversa,tion a Bedwin sheikh arrived and 1 rose to to take my leave but Fauzi Bey begged me to remain. - j,l/ie sheikn talked to Fauzi Bey on the canal part of the programme and I gathered from their remarks that it had already been discussed between them. I should mention that the sheikh on arriving asked the Bey if he could speak in my presence to which Fauzi assented. They then discussed plans xor destroying the embankment between the fresh water canal and the Suez Canal in order to cut off the drinking water supply of Ismailia and Suez. I asked the sheikh how he proposed to divert the fresh water canal into Suez Canal. He replied that with 200 men and suffi cient dynamite he could do it in 24 hours. Fauzi Bey interposed that he could easily have a thousand kilograms of dynamite if he required it. I asked the sheikh sarcastically if he meant to employ bedwin or fellaheen on the job, to which he replied, somewhat nettled, that it did not matter which. The sheikh left us and Fauzi Bey and I continued our conversation. I asked him how he was going to organise a revolution in Egypt without arms and mentioned tha/b the a,rms law had been rigorously applied since two years ago. He replied that he had a sufficient quantity of arms in the country and in any case arms could bebe smuggled through with ease. I reverted to the subject of the fresh water canal, remarking that I thought it an absurd project to which he replied that he believed it quite practical and that the sheikh was a man of intelli gence and sense . He went on to say that it was not the only means which he had with which to deal with the canal problem. A wealthy Turk had presented the government with a steamship which sailed under the Italian flag and waa commanded by an ex-officer of the Turkish Navy. This ship was to take a full cargo of cement from an Italian port and her manifests were to be made out for Massowa. The captain was to submit to any search by British warships without demur and on reaching Port Said to steam at full speed down the canal, He was then to sink her by one of three methods, viz:: 1st to collide with a British ship; 2nd. to provoke a British warship to sink her by ignoring signals^ 3rd. to sink her himself. Fauzi Bey told me he had a trustworthy Egyptian officer who was leaving for Egypt by the first Khedivial Mail steamer to take part in the operations there and to bear instructions to his agents. I afterwards spoke to Dr. Priifer about Fauzi’s canalcanal project. He did not seem to approve but gave me the map of the Suez Canal. I met Fauzi again at the passport office as I was about to embark on the S.S. 'Saidia” . He only greeted me and said he hoped to see me back soon. He is the officer whom I mentioned in my former evidence as having seen me at the quays and who may have overheard my cabin number. Q. Who are the police officers in league with Fauzi Bey? A. He did not give me their names. I mentioned the names of several officers of my acquaintance but after scrutinising the list he gave me a negative answer. Q. Do you know the names of any of the Army officers who figured on the list? A. ho. Q. Who were the officers despatched to Egypt in connexion with the organisation of the 'comitadji 11 bands ? A. I do not know; they left for Egypt before me. Q. Who was the Bedwin sheikh who discussed the fresh water canal project? A. I do not know his name; He was a man of about fifty years of age, with a full grey beard. He was about my height but broad shouldered and stout HeHe spoke educated Arabic without a Bedwin or Maghrabi accent. Q. Who was the officer in Alexandria with whom you were to co-operate? A. He gave me no inkling as to who he was. Q. Did Enver Pasha speak to you on the subject of military operations in Egypt, the destruction of the canal etc.? A. Yes, on the day before 1 sailed when 1 called upon him with Dr. Pnifer and the officer of the ,l Lorelei“ . He questioned me on public opinion here, whether the natives would revolt against the English if the Turks marched against Egypt and suggested that I should see Fauzi Bey on the subject. I replied that 1 had already seen him and I recapitulated what he had told me. Enver Pasha replied that there would be certainly some thing for me to do in Egypt when the time came for action there, if I was then still disposed to accept. He also asked me if I spoke Arabic. Q. Did Fauzi Bey mention the name of the Egyptian officer who was leaving for Egypt by the first Khedivial Mail steamer? A. Ho, but in the light of subsequent events, I believe it was Hamuda Effendi. Q. When you told Fauzi Bey that you were disposed to participate in military operations against this country, did he accept your offer? A.A. \ \ Jf Yes, but it was agreed between us that this should take effect after I returned from Alexandria with my family , Q. Then why were you given the detonators to take to Egypt? A. I do not know. I am convinced that Hamuda Effendi was the person designed for the enterprise connected with the detonators. I do not think that this mission was connected with the subject which Omar Fauzi Bey discussed with me. I think it must have been a secret between Sheikh Abd-el- Aziz Shawish, Dr. Ahmad Fued and Prufer and Hanuda Effendi. rs Q. Have you no idea what Hamuda was to do with the detonators? A. 1 know they were for use with bombs to be manu factured in this country. Q. How do you know that? A. Because once I found Sheikh Shawish sitting with Dr. Prufer in the latter’s room at the Hotel G-ermania. They were copying in Arabic a recipe for making bombs. The paper from which Sheikh Shawish was copying contained directions , a list of the component chemicals and a sketch of a bomb in the right hand bottom corner. I heard them mention that it was to be given to the Egyptian officer and Sheikh Shawish said to me in Arabic M Rua zabit zayak”. Q.Q. To what use were the bombs to be put? A. I have no idea, (Signed) R, 0,0. Mors. Above statement taken down by me this tenth day of October, 1914. Bimbashi.BRITISH AGENCY, CAIRO. lonfidential .

On the 28th instant iLieut. \ Mors was in a oommunicatiTe mood and gave some instructive evidence with regard to German and Turkish activity in Bgypt. The Police are now Beaching for the Egyptian offi cer Ahmed Hamuda and will arrest and interrogate him. He appears to have played a serious part in the present case. Lieut. Mors is fully aware of the serious position in which he has placed himself, but although willing to throw light on certain features of his case, he is obstinate and refuses to answer certain questions. He is ready to admit that the story of how he came by the bag of detona tors could not be expected to carry conviction, but he refuses to emend it in any way. At the second interroga'' tory he made important admissions with regard to the cypher found in his •tarbush*', which contained apparently innocent phrases, such as 'B^b^ va bien', 'Vendu,....Mantars cotton” etc. - He had destroyed the key after his arrest. But these phrases referred to movements of British and Indian troops and other matters of a similar nature. We hope to get usdful information from Ahmed Hamuda if his arrest can be effected*ALBXMi tIBIA CITY Pft T.TTW- (^} 5) p y Alexandria, 28th Septeaaber, 1914. v Mnlazim Awal Hobert Caeimir Otto More, Egyptian Police, re-examined t etates At Constantinople 1 was acquainted with a German Official who was formerly in the German Diplomatic Agency give, was in agreement with the Turkish GoTemment on the subject of military operations in Egypt, and, as he knew that I knew Egypt Tery well, he eonducted me to Enver Pasha the Turkish Minister of War. The latter questioned me on the military situation; if it were true that the British had disarmed the Egyptian Army etc. I replied that I did not know and thought it unlikely. I then left the presence of Enver and he remained talking with the German official. 1 forgot to mention that he asked me if I would participate in operations in Egypt. I replied that I would only participate in open military action. I was afterwards informed by the German Official that Enver had sent Offi cers from the Turkish Army to Egypt to prepare Native public opinion for action in favour of Turkey. I also heard from the German Official that one of Enver's emissa ries was an Officer of the Egyptian Army, but I did not know then his name. I must mention here that 1 understood from various things and from conversations that I overheard between the said German official and various people that he had the intention of sending printed matters and explos ives to Egypt. I also understood that it was the Egyptian Army Officer who was charged with the transport of these things. We were held up in the Dardanelles for six days QwinK to, the wreck of a cargo boat. On the second we y^ere stopped there; the Bash Reis (Boatswain) of the w Saidieh w brought me a small leather bag (which I recognised as being the property of the said German official) and told me that somebody on board had given it to him to give to the passen- in Cairo. This gentleman, whose name I must refuse to-ger in ! ro .7 catin, viz, my cabin. At the same time the Bash-reis asked me if it belonged to me. I said M yes w because I began to suspect that the contents of the bag were the explosives that I had heard about. I opened the bag and found it was half full of packing material and on probing it I found there were hard substances underneath. I thought that if I said that the sack did not belong to me it might be handed over to the ship’s captain and it would then be discovered what the contents were, and an accident might even occur. I did not know at this time that the Bash-Reis had guilty knowledge of the contents of the bag and therefore told him that there was nothing in it. I then took it into my cabin to examine it and found the two tin boxes which you seized. 'Whilst we were still in thexDardanelles, as far as I can remember it was the fourth day there, the Egyptian Officer came to me and said in Arabic 'Are you not the passenger occupying 1?°.7 cabin ?** X said '•Yes, Why ?' and he said 'Have you x'eceived the things?' (Wasal-lak el shay'') I replied 'Was it you who sent it to me ?' He said 'Perhaps' (Yimhin') I then said 'What have such things to do with me ?'. He said 'I cannot keep such things myself'. I then asked him who gave them to him. He replied 'Eouad'. I do not know who this Eouad is exactly but it is possibly AhmaB Eouad at Constantinople whom I have seen with the German | official, and who is an intimate friend of Sheikh Aod-el- 1 Aziz Shawish according to all reports. He then tola me nis name was Ahmad Hamuda and that he had fought against the Italians in Tripoli. He showed me his card on which was writtep 'Ahmad Hamuda; Officer of the Egyptian Army'. I do not remember if the card bore his rank or not. I saw Ahmad Hamuda Eff. after leaving Piraeus when he came and asked me what I had done with the tin ooxes. I understood from the way he put it, that he wanted to take them from me but this is only an idea I had. I told him I had thrown(3) them overhoard. When we were anchored in the harbour he again came and ashed me uo take his revolver ashore, I replied that I had my own revolver and that I should he searched like everybody else. Ee then asked me if they would search his wife. I said 'Naturally', they have female searchers A at the Customs'. I had the intention of throwing the tin boxes over- board out I was afraid that they might explode on striking the water: I therefore procured some cord with which I meant to,lower them into the water, I never got a chance and I was afraid that the propeller would catch the cord and the steamer might be blown up or damaged. f Another thing which deterred me was that I was afraid the boxes might float and be dangerous to shipping, so I postponed it until our arrival at Smyrna where I telegra phed to the German official at Constantinople staling that two tin boxes with unknown contents had been handed to me and I desired instructions. At Piraeus I received a telegram telling me to throw them overboard, which for the reasons I have just given I again postponed.' Q,UI£&amp;PKftT Have you any witnesses to prove that the boat swain gave you the bag containing the tin boxes Answer.:- Yes, a certain Portunato the cabin steward was pre sent and I gave him the bag with the packing after removing the tin boxes, asking him to throw the packing overboard. He did so and returned me the bag. On arrival in port here I gave the tin boxes to kohamed Ali the purser and asked him to keep them with him until he had a chance to throw them overboard without being observed by the various launches. I also recommended him not to throw them from the deck but to descend the gangway and drop them into the sea carefully aftex 1 weighting them with a piece of iron. I told him they contained dangerous substances and to be very careful. I noticed he seemed afraid and t^lcl Him jf loo r jd to do it, he n^oul-^rive them.a n ti (4) iHR' tvi* told him if he did not wish to do it, he should give them uach to me.

October loth 1914. (cl. 3.4b p.m. Oct. 15th. r. 1.10 a.m. Oct. 16th). 00 I learn that Zekki Pasha, comoander of 8th Corps, has lately received £5,000 uo distribute amongst Bedouins and that as much as £3o,0u0 in gold left here by train on 12th for Syria. Senater Aodurrahman is working among Bedouins at Maan and Liumtas Bev on the west by Beersheba and Jerusalem. Party of Turkish sailors mentioned as having left here by tram for Basrah are now stated to ,oe on the way to Akaba with consignment of metal boats. Another lot of boats is at Rayak possibly on the way to Beyrout. Quantities of dynamite have been sent to the coast toms of Syria probably to serve for mining purposes of land defence. This is in addition to sea mines which have been also forwarded, numbers of 'working battalions', (soldiers as yet untrained), are road-constructing in southern Syria. Son of Kurdish chief Issa, who is stated to have influence in Mesopotamia and who has been in Constantinople for in structions, is sand to have left for Basrah to work anti- Rnglish propaganda, and other agents including Germans are said to be on their ^y : j^Q., Afghanistan on similar errand. All above and previous reports in a, similar sense show tnat toore is very considerable activity being directed in a sense so stile to us and this activity/ is being worked by German in fluence and agents in everv conceivable direction. Probably GovernmentA-f' C-ovemmont as a whole has little control over these activities, hut does not disapprove of them. As regards actual military preparations G-eman element has sufficient power to persuade the authorities on certain points.

(October 15, 5'50 p.m.) HIS Majesty’s consul at Aleppo reports that he learns that a tailor in that town has been commissioned to make a variety of Indian costumes and head-dresses on design and measurement supplied by German officers there. I repeat this information because German plots have been so extensive that it is conceivable that they may introduce individuals into Egypt who, personating Indian soldiers, may cause mischief.

(October 14, 11T5 p.m.) I UNDERSTAND from a well-informed source that the German Ambassador is concentrating all his efforts upon attempts to excite a rising in Egypt and in the Caucasus, and taking less interest for the present in an attack on Russian fleet. Possibly the diminishing coal supply may be affecting his attitude to some extent. The Turkish newspapers here are all in the pay of German Embassy, who have spent very large sums in corruption both here and in the provinces. A daily stream of calumny and mendacity pours from German Embassy, and is circulated throughout the country, with the object of inoculating belief that Great Britain is the enemy of Islam.

Although corroborated by acting vice-consul at Jaffa, I give them with reserve.” I read above to Grand Vizier this morning. He expressed himself as altogether ignorant of such proceedings, and characterised as absurd [group undecypherable] raid on Egyptian frontier. Notwithstanding his disclaimer, it is quite possible, and even probable in so far as mission to Bedouins is concerned, that this has taken place. Various acts have been carried out by Minister of War entirely on his own responsibility. I am pressing this question on attention of other Ministers. (Sent to Cairo.) 2r *' [931- 1184]CONFIDENTIAL.

(September 20, 12'35 p.m.) FOLLOWING from military attache :— “ Though I still do not view with much apprehension eventuality of any organised offensive measures on the part of Turks towards Egyptian frontier, certain steps have been taken lately which should lie noticed. Rolling stock has been collected on Hedjaz line at Deraa and numbers of camels at Maan. Further Turkish staff officers, disguised as Arabs, have been south of Gaza and also at Akaba. Homs [group omitted : ? corps] is said to be moving shortly to Damascus, and part of Mosul corps has been sent westward to Eszor. Reports from Damascus and Jerusalem state that Government are leaving no stone unturned to gain over Druses and Bedouins, to which end German agents also have been at work. “ It seems unlikely that anything can be gained from Druses except a non-hostile attitude towards Turks, but with regard to Bedouin tribes it may be that money payments, added to religious incitement, may induce them to some sporadic action on frontier to win profit for themselves. “ Grand Vizier and other Ministers disclaim with vehemence any hostile intentions against Egypt. I think that their assurances are genuine, but that they are often ignorant of Minister of War’s orders and intentions. “ I shall bring these facts to their notice.” [93I—1158jSir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 31, 8*40 a.m.) Constantinople, August 31, 1^14. (No. 655.) (August 31, 3'30 a.m.) CONSULS at [? Adana], [? Alexandretta], and Aleppo under date of 27th August to 29th August all report movements of troops belonging to Aleppo army corps os directed towards Constantinople. These movements [? may] also include Homs division of Damascus army corps. This therefore verifies to a great extent any assumption that offensive measures on any scale are not contemplated against Egypt, although there may be despatch of officers and emissaries and other means of stirring up agitation. It is not likely that Hedjaz troops could be moved from that region. Despatch of [? 79th] and 80th regiments towards frontier is now said to be cancelled, but Druse Bey of Yahir is said to have promised men for service and probably Turks are doing all they can to conciliate local sympathies, possibly with idea of assistance of irregular levies in case of war ensuing.

(August 28, 4-50 p.m.) passed through Egypt and Suez down Red Sea. They stated their destination was Ottoman forces^ are no doubt being mobilised in Hedjaz and further south as in other parts of the Empire, and military activity in Red Sea may be explained in this way. I understand that recent pacification in Assir was incomplete, and Ottoman Government probably also desire to guard against possible hostile move on the part of Shereef of Mecca. Consul at Yeddah reports 12,000 Turkish troops in that region. There are numerous signs, however, that an attack on Egypt forms part of Turkish plans in case of war. There are a few Turkish officers in the Delta, some of whom cannot be traced. All known are being watched. The Egyptian Prince Aziz Hassan, who commanded cavalry division in Balkan war, has just returned from Constantinople. He corroborates all information of Ottoman mobilisation contained in Sir L. Mallet’s telegrams, but informs me very confidentially that Turks expect to be ready to move about 15th September, and that strength of Syrian corps, which are weak, can be considerably raised. Meanwhile, emissaries are being sent to Egypt, India, Yemen, and Senoussi, to stir up feeling. There are reports of activity at Gaza, though it remains uncertain whether this is more than raising of levies to replace regulars withdrawn from north by mobilisation. I have consulted advisers and General Officer Commanding, and we should like any available information as to date of arrival of troops from India. Latest news is that they have not yet reached Aden. Their early arrival would have calming effect among Egyptians, who are already very apprehensive of Turkish attack. Above is confidential. (Sent to Constantinople.)CONFIDENTIAL. I '% Sir L.

It is very desirable that you should again impress strongly on El Mazri the need for him to keep quiet and to lea,ve the Arabs alone. 4CONFIDENTIAL. Mr. Cheetham to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received August 9, 10 p.m.) Cairo, August 9, 1914. (No. 76. Confidential.) K. (August 9, 9‘5 p.m.) THE famous Aziz-el-Mazri has communicated to Sudan agent following story of projected Turkish aggression against Egypt:— A pro-Turkish movement under German auspices has for some time been working against England in Egypt, among Eastern tribes, and in Sudan. It is intended to take advantage of any opportunity offered by present war to attack Egypt from Syria. Two members of Turkish general staff are at present intriguing in Alexandria. Aziz- el-Mazri has been asked by Enver Pasha to go to Constantinople to arrange for concerted action, in which part Aziz-el-Mazri is to raise the Arabs against England. Aziz-el-Mazri stated that he has refused to co-operate on these lines, and instead proposed to lead the Arabs (Syria and Irak) against the Turks in order to form an Arab empire under British suzerainty. For this he would need assistance from us. In spite of Turkish mobilisation in Syria there is no information of attack from that quarter at present, and ambitions of Aziz-el-Mazri and his rivalry with Enver are well known ; but presence of Turkish officers in Egypt is highly undesirable. Accordingly, Alexandrian police have received orders to look for an opportunity of getting them quietly out of the country. Meanwhile, an entirely vague and non-committal answer has been given to Aziz- el-Mazri, and any further dealings with him will be carried on through an agent and not directly. But general officer commanding considers arrival of even a small reinforcement from India (or Malta) would prove both to Turks and Egyptians that we have command of the sea and that Egypt is not isolated from the rest of the world. Though the country is quiet, all information at my command as to probable results among population of interference by Turkey leads me to concur in this view. s:’,( &gt; 969</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000167_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/464</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000167</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/464</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 3136/1914 Pt 4 ‘German War.
