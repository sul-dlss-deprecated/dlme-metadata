M's Political Agent, Bahrain , Memorandum:- Por some time I have been exploring the possibility Qf obtaining oranges from x'alesuine for salcj in Bahra.in. Owiap' to the war very little fruit now comes to Bahrain. I have discussed the matter with a firm of Bahrain merchants, Messrs. A.A. Zayani and Sons, who trade between Bahraxn, Iraq and India. I understand that_owing to lack of ships much of the Palestine orange crop is unsold. It now appears that owing to the ban pxaced on tne import of Palestine oranges into Iraq it would be impossible to obtain oranges from Palestine without permission froiu the Ir^q Government for transit through Iraq. I enclose copies of letters on the subject and should be glad to know whether you consider that it is worth • persuing the matter Adviser to the Government. «Copy of D.O.No.2015-51/3? dated_3rd November, 1942, from the Adviser to tiie Town Major, Bahidin. aS '^i i \ il-J I have for some time beexi making enquiries about gettin oranges and other citric fruit from Palestine imported into Bahrain for sale. I am informed by a local firm, A.A. Zayani and Sons, that they can obtain oranges in large quantities in Palestine but are unable to send them through Iraq in transit for Bahrain unless the fruit is for sale to the forces. Is it possible that you would be interesteu in onis matter? I am told that there is so much citncs in Palestine that it is being wasted, yet Iraq won't allow it into the country. S.Z. I kCopy of a letter No. TMB/FSL T P/59-1153/4y dated 15th Ho t ember, 1642, frora Town Major, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Reference your D.O. 2015-513F dated November 3 1942 The Army can absorb 1000 lbs oranges weekly as a ration. In addition if the price is attractive I would say they would purchase an equal number. I am not prepared to guarantee the merchant against failure financially, nor will the army be subject to any financial loss on the grounds of breach of contract as no guarantee will be given. I am prepared subject to the abo /e conditions to grant the necessary authority to import oranges or other fruits. 3 ^.Z. ... mm ■ f'Jf \ frV-A. .■ ■- , - ■ V Copy of a letter dated 22nd November, 1942, from. Messrs. A.A. Zayani and Sons, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. With reference to our verbal conversation with you as well as j^our communications with the Defence Officer for the supply of fresh fruits such as oranges etc. from Palestine, to the armies at Bahrain, we would inform you that the imports of the fruits are only possible if the Iraq .Government allow the export through Iraq,. In order to enable us to get the fruits via Iraq we would request you to favour us with a Standing Letter of Authority to the Iraq Government to allow the export without objection. v Hoping that you would be glad to favour us with a chance of the manner described above, to be of services to the armies here.
