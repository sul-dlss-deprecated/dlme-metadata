From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla (addressed to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf). Against the charges of inconsistency, I fear I have no defence to offer, and Mashon cargo was consigned to Louis Dieu, and not to order. On the assumption that it is unfair to apply Rule 6, I presume Laubenburg will name as “ real*’ consignee, among others, Ali Khan and Abdul Rahim Jafar. It remains to be seen whether His Highness the Sultan of Maskat will compel those consignees to take delivery for there is no market for these goods immediately, as (vide fourth point of Secretary of State’s telegram) not only has the Shaikh of Kuwait placed bis orders in France, but has obtained delivery of goods, or whether the consignees will themselves accept goods under altered conditions, namely, strict compliance with warehouse rules and regulations. What Laubenburg desires is for me to bring pressure on Sultan of Maskat to compel Arab consignees (to ?) bear the charges involved by warehouse regula tions in preference to Laubenburg. As warehouse rent, and charges for seven months are now due on these goods, it is inevitable that loss must fall on some one, and before the goods find a market it is not easy to forecast how much more will be due on them. Laubenburg contends that as his risk terminates when the goods once reach Maskat harbour none of this loss should fall on him, but it will not he easy to induce Sultan of Maskat, and Arab traders to accept this view of the situation. I do not think that interests of firm would be much advanced, if I were permitted by Government to tender advice to His Highness to release goods, for until a settlement is arrived at as to the question of who is to bear the loss, it is uncertain whether Arab traders w ill take delivery, and whether they will pay in full Laubenburg s bill, even if they do take delivery. Enhanced value of the ammunition now- a-days seems to me to be the only inducement that might impel them to do so, but this, considering uncertainties of market, is no great inducement. Orders are requested as to whether I may consult His Highness, and ascertain whether Arabs will accept delivery. That they will refuse, and that His Highness will certainly not compel them is my own impression m the matter.From Viceroy, 9th May 1913. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 21st April. Laubenburg. (1) Political Agent now reports that arms were consigned to Louis Dieu and not to order. This appears to be correct, vide Laubenburg’s letter of 17th January 1913 to Political Agent at Maskat, copy forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 10 M. dated 6th March. This letter shows that goods were consigned to care of Louis Dieu to whom bill of lading which was made out to order was sent. (2) and (3) As arms were shipped before information as to forms had reached Laubenburg we agree that it would be inequitable to apply Rule 6. Cox suggests that we should simply inform Laubenburg that we have, advised the Sultan to release arms which would be subject to application of Rules 7 to 12, and that if Dieu is admitted as the documentary consignee he is person to whom intimation of release should be made by Sultan. We agree, and as we do not intend to intervene between (lirm ?) and consignee there seems to be no need to require an allidavit, nor need we enquire whether native dealers for whom arms were really intended will take delivery. (4) Political Agent at Maskat reports that Sheikh ol Kovyeit placed orders in France but has already obtained delivery of goods. Con sequently, proposal that Sheikh should purchase irom Laubenburg s stock is now impracticable.ARMS TRAFFIC. Muscat Warehouse Rules, 1912. Notice by His Highness Sir Seyyid Faisal-bin Turki, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Muscat and Oman. I he following draft rules for the establishment, maintenance, and control of the arms warehouse are published for the information of all concerned. 1 he said rules will be held to apply to all arms and ammunition or parts thereof held in our territories by traders for sale on the date of the intro duction of the said rules, and to all such arms, ammunition, or parts thereof as may be thereafter imported into our territories. On, or about, but not before, the 1st September 1912, a subsidiary notice will be issued in due course confirming these draft rules and notifying the date on which the rules so confirmed shall come into operation.

If the offending trader be a subject of any of the Powers in treaty relations with me, information will be laid against him to the Consul of the Power whose subject or protege he may be, and the aforesaid Consul will be requested to deal with him according to law and treaty and the spirit of these regulations. Ride 3.—In addition to all or any of the penalties imposed by these rules, should any trader be found guilty in the proper forum of offending against the provisions of Rule 1 aforesaid, all arms, ammunition, or parts thereof held in the Muscat arms warehouse to the credit of such offending trader, or that may subsequently be deposited in the arms warehouse in his name under the provisions of Rule 4, will, without further sentence of forfeiture, be liable to confiscation. Ride 4. ---All arms, ammunition, or parts thereof which may hereafter be imported into Muscat territory will be taken direct to the arms warehouse and there deposited. Rule 5. —For the more effective carrying out of the provisions of the preceding rule, the masters ot' steamers importing arms and ammunition or parts thereof will be required to produce on arrival and furnish to the representative of the warehouse superintendent, who will attend on board, the copy of a separate manifest, in the form attached and marked P, showing S. 198—2. Aall arms and ammunition and parts thereof destined for importation into my territories and carried on board their vessels. Rale 6.—All arms, ammunition, or parts thereof destined for import into Muscat, but not detailed, or incorrectly or insufficiently described, in the separate manifest (Form B), especially with regard to the marks on the packages or the name of the consignee, shall, as soon as such arms, ammunition, or parts thereof have left the ship’s tackles, become liable to confiscation. Exception .—The sole exception to the operation of this rule shall be in the case of arms, ammunition, or parts thereof landed by mistake in good faith and clearly destined for some other port to which the import of arms and ammunition is not prohibited. The burden of proving that such arms and ammunition were intended for import to a port to which the import of arms and ammunition is not prohibited shall lie on the steamer’s agent, importer, or consignee. No claims under this exception will be entertained after a period of three months from date of landing of the goods in respect of which the claim is made. • Rale 7.—All arms, ammunition, or parts thereof, deposited in the arms warehouse in accordance with the revisions of Rule 4, shall be claimed by the consignee within a period of three months from the date of deposit in the arms warehouse. On such claim being made the warehouse superintendent will, subject to the provisions of Rules 8 ami 8a immediately following, and after due veri fication of the bill of lading and steamer’s agent’s deli very order, grant a detailed receipt in Form A above mentioned. Ride 8.—As soon as, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4 aforesaid, arms and ammunition or parts thereof are brought to the arms warehouse to be there deposited, the superintendent, arms warehouse, shall notify the superintendent of customs of the arrival of such arms ammu nition, or parts thereof by form attached and marked 0 (Arabic) in order that duty may be collected thereon by the superintendent of customs.

Rule 9.—Failure by consignee to comply with the provisions of either of the three preceding rules shall render the arms, ammunition, or parts thereof liable to confiscation. Issue of Arms, Ammunition, or parts thereof from the Arms Warehouse. Rule 10. —Any person proposing to purchase arms, ammunition, or parts thereof from any trader, owning arms, ammunition, or parts thereof stored in the arms warehouse in accordance with the provisions of Rules 1 and 4 above, and duly claimed under the provisions of Rule 7, and on which dutv and warehouse charges have been fully paid in accordance with the provisions of Rules 8 and 16 respectively, will be permitted to withdraw arms arid ammunition or parts thereof on the production of, and to the extent covered by, a licence in form marked D and attached. On the application of the trader concerned, who must be present at such withdrawal, the warehouse superintendent shall draw up the licence aforesaid, and submit it for my approval and signature.Rule 11.—It shall be the duty of the warehouse superintendent to refuse to draw up any such licence, should he have reason to suppose— (a) That the purchaser whose name it is proposed to enter in form D as “ bearer ” intends to resell the arms, ammunition, or parts thereof to any other person; (b) That such purchaser is already, whether by licence in Form D previously issued or otherwise, in possession of arms, ammunition, or parts thereof, whence it may be inferred that the arms, ammunition, or parts thereof covered by the licence under question, are not required solely for the personal use or protection of the purchaser. Rule 12.—It shall further be the duty of the warehouse superintendent to ensure that— (a) All rifles issuing from the arms warehouse under the terms of any licence, issued in accordance with the provisions of these rules, shall be clearly marked on the barrel before withdrawal with the official mark, and on the butt with the serial number of issue ; (b) No more than 200 rounds per rifle per annum shall be issued from the arms warehouse to any holder of a licence under Form D ; (c) In the event of a licence under Form D being issued for ammunition only, which must not in any case exceed 200 rounds per annum per purchaser, the purchaser produces, for the inspection of the warehouse superintendent, the weapon in respect of which the ammunition is required. Rule 13. -On the production of the weapon as directed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 12 (c), the Warehouse Superintendent shall pro ceed to satisfy himself that the weapon is duly marked on the barrel with the official mark of the Arms Warehouse and on the butt with the serial number of issue. If it is found not to be so marked, the Superintendent shall, after marking the weapon with the marks and number of the Arms Warehouse, refer the question of the legality of possession of the weapon to me for orders. The burden of proving that the weapon was innocently come by and not in infringement of the rules of the Arms Warehouse, will lie on the owner and, should he fail to prove innocent possession, the weapon shall be liable to confiscation. Rule 14.—All owners of any firearms, kept in our territories for personal use and protection, are earnestly advised to bring them to the Muscat Arms Warehouse to be marked with an official number and mark as soon as possible. Within a reasonable period of the publication of these rules, it is intended to alter Rules 12 (c) and 13 in such a way that no ammunition will be allowed to issue from the Arms Warehouse except to -(a) holders of rifles or firearms marked with the official mark and number of the Arms Warehouse, (6) purchasers of new rifles or firearms issuing from the Arms Warehouse. Rule 15. To meet the needs of traders who may desire to expose in their shops a sample of arms and ammunition for sale, a trader’s licence in Form E, Arabic form ( ), can be procured by them from the Warehouse Superin tendent. A trader holding such a licence wdli be permitted to withdraw from the Arms Warehouse one sample weapon of every kind of which he may have stocks lying in the Arms Warehouse under the provision of Rules 1 and 4, 7 and 8 aforesaid, together with 200 rounds of ammunition per sample weapon. This stock of ammunition may be renewed under trader’s licence twice a year on the personal guarantee of the trader that it is not for sale but merely “ practice ” ammunition.

Grey to transmit to you herewith a copy of a further letter from Messrs. Kynoch, Limited, respecting the restrictions placed on the importation of arms and ammunition into Muscat. Pending the receipt of the report from the Government of India. for which the Marquess of Crewe proposed to call, Sir 3. Grey would suggest that it might be explained to Messrs. Kynoch that the cartridges ordered oy the Sultans of Muscau and Koweit would he for their own use and selected at their ov/n discretion and that they could not take goods consigned to someone else merely because such goods happened to he lying in the warehouse at Muscat. I am, : M V . r -' g- Sir, jL ..4 ■ Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Under Secretary 0 f State, India Office.I Sir:« of your- letter of the Sna instant Fef. 14664/1:5, to which we have not been able to reply earlier owing to the abuowce of the writer. There are several letters bearing upon the natter in question, but we think that we cannot cio better than enclose you herewith extracts from two of these letters, which ./ill probably suffice. If you wish it, you may have the original communications from which these extracts have been made. In reply to the concluding paragraph of your letter of the 2nd instant, what we cannot understand is why the Sultans of Muscat and Koweit should pl ace urgent orders with Continental firms who are not in the habit of making this particular cartridge whilst there is a large quantity of our own cartridges lying in the bonded warehouse at Muscat and also obtainable The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. IRNHExtract from Agent’s letter dated Muscat 25th January 1913. Allkhan and Abdool Rahim Jaffar went to the Sultan and said that as regards the Field Rifle Company (Laubenburg and Company) they had deposits in that firm which deposits will be paid back only if they take delivery of the goods now warehoused in the Custom House. They then asked the Sultan to grant them an authority to sell those goods to Hadji Nadjeff who has obtained from the English authorities a permit for a stated number of guns and ammunition. The Sultan submitted the matter to the English Consul who gave the following reply. I do not care whether those transactions have been done on a CIF basis or not, nor do I care whether the Field Rifle Company has the right to claim for the payment of the goods kept back by the Custom House. As we (the Consulate) are supporting the Sultan in all his business trans actions, we will not compel his subjects to pay for goods whether we have the right or not. The only thing to do is to leave things as they are. If the Muscat customers do not pay, I shall not listen to theVue complaints of the Field p lfie Company on that subject, but on the other hand I cannot compel them to pay back the deposits. You will certainly realise that when customers hear such words from the English Consul, they belaeve they are encouraged in not paying.Extract from Muscat friend's letter dated 26th February 1913. Muscat affairs . We take a note of what you say under this heading re the orders to trance. His Hoyal Highness the Sultan of Muscat had an enquiry for Cartridges and orders have been passed to France. Also Sheikh of Koweit required certain quantity of Cartridges for which he obtained special permits through the Political agent (British Consul) and orders were passed through his agents to France, a portion of which quantity has been shipped and is on the way from Europe to Muscat.— I .a ' ,a «J 8 O i t/k dirt Hx*l • . &lt; OOKF iaag ^lAL.

Sir, With reference to telegram No: 359.D. Dated 12.3.13. from the Foreign Department to your address and repeated to me, i have the honour to report that Messrs C.H.Lauhenhurg &amp; Co: are under a misapprehension , when they state, in their letter dated the 4 th: February 1913, to the address of the Under Secretary of State Foreign Office , that the British Consul at Masqat declines to release goods, shipped by them In the Steam Ship M Hashona ' which arrived at Maslcat on the 14th: of September 1912. 2. /ou are, oil, perfectly aware that it is His Highness the Sultan of Mashat , and not the British Consul, Mashat , in whose power it lies to release, or detain, arms and ammunition arriving at Mashat. The utmost that the British Consul could do would be, on behalf of British goods, to recommend their release on the ground that the goods had been forwarded in fun compliance with tne regulations , promulgated by His Highness the Sultan of Mashat eariy_in June 1912, and enforced from the 1st: September 1912. 3. iii the circumstances of the present case, about which Messrs Laubenbur^Sc Co: are now complaining, I find rnyseif entirely unable to mahe any recommendation whatever in favour of Messrs Lauoenburg &amp; Co:,because the goods offend against Rule 6 of the Regulations, anuded to in paragraph 2 above. I may note perhaps that this apparent technicality - the goods were consigned _o Order”, and no consignees name was entered — is , froia tle polnt of vl9W ttie local authorities of Maslcat, a tter of the veiy greatest Importance, it Is essential for them tnat they should know, as the goods leave the steamer, that sorae- ° ne ’ wel1 ]crlowa t0 “fr®™ and residing In Maslcat, win through out 1 i m 1 S ■P.s. 'be responsiiDie for each shipment. 4. It would he useless for me to attempt to advise His Highness the Sultan to stultify himself by treating as unimpor tant the very particular on which the whole of the Regulations turn. Nor have I by any means been satisfied that the original destination of the goods in question was unobjectionable or a nonprohibited area. What actually happened, so far as I have been aoie to make out, was that , when the consignees found that thegoods in question were detained , they attempted to make out a case for themselves by entering into agreement with the Agent of the Sheikh of Kowelt who had recently been permitted by the Government of India to import a itflfge quantity of arms and ammunition forthe arming of his tribal levies, for the sai e to him of a portion 01 the detained goods. This fact was brought to ray notice but I still, for the reasons that I have already given in paragraph 3 aoove, found myseif unable to tender any advice to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat on the subject.

Lauhenhurg and Company of Bir::iingharn, to pay us for t-iie Cartridges supplied to them for the a/bove market and to come to some arrangement in regard to the onher goods prepared in accordance with their order, but still undelivered on account of the restrictions put into operation at Muscat. They inform ub that they have been un&amp;hle to get any satisfactory replies either from their buyers or the British Consul in s Muscat, and that you have net granted an interview to them when they could have laid their case before you. Being very old customers, we do not wish to make their position any worse, but the time has come when something must be done. According to information which has reached us Secretary of State, Foreign Office. fromI i, irorn reli-erbie'” stsilfce b, further orders for Aiiinunition have 'been placed on the Continent for quick delivery; amongst o oners by one Suloan hiiiiself and the Sheik of Koweit. The negotiations in connection with these orders appear to have been partly carried out and assisted by the British Consul in Muscat who, ac cording to our informants, would appear to be doing everything possible to divert to the Continent business which, up to the present, has been done through British houses. Moreover, he appears to have put every obstacle possible in the way of getting the goods belonging to our friends released from the bonded warehouse, and if the Cartridges now being ordered on the Continent are so urgently required, we are at a loss to understand why the Sultan and the Sheik of Koweit in particular should not take delivery of these Cartridges. In addition to this we are assured that peraits are being granted to Continental houses or their agents, with the knowledge of the British Consul, for supplies of Cartridges destined for the districtsf S t If tills infoiiiEtion (which, sis we stated, has come to us from reliable sources) is correct it is quite evident that the British firms are being placed in a most unfair position, and that something should be done iumdeiately by you to protect British interests. We hope to be able to confirm the above by actual shipments made, and about to be made, but feel that in cs.se you are unaware of these circumstances we should let you know what is happening in order that you may take all necessary steps to protect our interests. To justify the above remarks we are quite pre pared to produce original documents from our cor respondents who are in a position to know what is going on, and who are hardly likely to make incorrect statements.

[ 14664 ] Gentlemen, Foreign Office, April 2, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo respecting the effect of the regulations in force at Muscat with regard to the trade in arms and ammunition. I am to inform you in reply that, so far as the Secretary of State is aware, there has been no differentiation between the treatment of British 'and foreign firms in the enforcement of the regulations. Sir E, Grey would, however, be glad to receive the documentary evidence on this point which you state is in your possession. The fact that ammunition had been imported for the personal use of the Sultan of Muscat or the Sultan of Koweit would have no connection with the rules regulating general trade with those places.

I have the honour to forward, for your information, the copy in duplicate of a letter dated the 17th January 1913, which I have received from Messrs. C. H. Laubenburg &amp; Co., of Birmingham. I venture to express the opinion that, in view of the reply which I addressed to that firm (vide my confidential letter No. 218, dated the 22nd December 1912, to your address) and in view of India Office letter No. 4377-P, dated the 20th November 1912, to the address of the Under-Secretary of State, Eoreign Office, nothing will be gained by my continuing this correspondence. I therefore, subject to your approval, propose to file these papers. Sub-enclosure. Dated the 17th January 1913. From—C. H. Laubenburg, and Company, 58, Cambridge St. 4 Birmingham, Trading also at the same address as Field Rifle Company. To— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. We beg to confirm lour respects of the 18th October 1912, and 7th November 1912, and regret we have not so far been favoured with your reply. In continuation of these letters, we may inform you that we are still with out any remittance for the amounts due to us, viz :— By Haji Ali Khan Moosa Khan, our invoice 5th July 1912, By Abdul Ali Rahim Jaffar „ „ £ s. d. 1,861 11 0 479 2 6 which represented goods shipped by the S. S. Turkistan, and which goods these customers illegally obtained without the production of the Bills of Lading which we also explained to you in our last letter. Mr. Khan has written us many times, saying that he is willing to pay for the Turkistan shipment £1,861-11-0, but that he wants to deduct a deposit we hold from him for £600 to which we cannot agree, as this would be absolutely contrary to the terms agreed between us upon which we hold the deposit. We have documentary evidence in our possession, which we can produce, proving that the deposit was to remain in our possession until all orders had been executed, and then the deposit was to be deducted from our last invoice. Now Mr. Khan also still owes £2,030-18-0 for the Mashona shipment, and besides, for 1,500 rifles plus 100 cartridges for each, being balance of his order, amounting to £3,000 which 1,500 rifles and cartridges Mr. Khan asked us in his letter dated 26th November 1912 to ship, which we shall of course be pleased to do, as soon as he pays up the previous drafts, because these goods have been lying ready for despatch here in our warehouse for some time. With2 regard to , i t -d -u:™ hesicles the amount of £479-2-6 for the _ Mr - Abdul babun ’ 10 f()I . t ] ie shipment, as Turkistan shipment owes *b customer we hold a deposit per our invoice of the 9th August * from0 ur last invoice, and as the of £700, which deposit also was to ^ J°J S on order, he is entitled to Mashmia shipment was f °f *k e ’ a h but not from the £179-2-6. deduct this sum from th ? fshipment, except that they want i to deduct + th « were confiscated by His shipment, they both refuse to p y, ^ un able to obtain possession of Itoyal Highness the S ' lt ™vt nd S t Tr a Xorities would not recognise them, and these customers to the care of them as consignees of W-shipment, because Urn goo^^ ^ ^ ^ Louis Dieu C ’ -j x i| ie gheikh of Koweit, who had a special could long ago have sold the goods but tbat in sp ite of being able to dv^safefJtory ’guarantees as to the ultimate destination of these goods able to give sausiactoi y 0 , +1 Wp are a + a loss to understand this the autnorities , tt* h et , s t p e gultan or whoever it may he; we maintain Ae' goods belong to any party who holds the Bills of Lading, which Messrs. Khan and Jaffar can at once obtain by paying our drafts. With regard to the goods having been consigned to the care of Messrs. Louis CT&amp; Co. of Maskat, we beg to say that in May 1912 we made Messrs L Dieu &amp; Co. of Paris and Maskat, our agents not only for the purpose of obtaining orders, but also that we might have some responsible party at Maskat to look after our interests, for we had a L S mScuS difficulty in obtaining prompt payment of our drafts, and moie particuia y, we had found out that these customers invariably obtained posession of our (roods without the production of the Bills of Lading. It was for these weighty reasons therefore, that we sent the Bills of Lading, which were made out to order ” to Messrk Louis Dieu &amp; Co , which firm consequently, we had to give as receivers, to the custom house here, otherwise we ran the risk of Messrs. Khan and Jaffar again obtaining our goods before they paid tor them. Messrs. Louis Dieu &amp; Co. have instructions to hand over the Bills ot Lading, or claim the goods on behalf of the customers as soon as they are satisfied that our respective drafts are paid. We mav further say that we informed both Messrs Khan and Jaffar abou the arrangement, as above explained, we had made with Messrs. Louis Dieu &amp; Co., and we have several letters in our possession, where they express entire approval of our action. Although we have thus fully written you on this matter by way of refut- ino* our customers’ reasons for not paying, we beg most emphatically to say that the fact of the goods having been confiscated, and new regulations made at Maskat by His Itoyal Highness the Sultan, which we consider contrary to the permits we hold from him, and contrary to the treaty, we have absolutely nothing whatever to do with these matters, as far as our engagements to our customers are concerned, because the terms upon which we accepted their orders, were for delivery c. i. f. Maskat, that is free Maskat Harbour, ! freight and insurance paid by us. Therefore, after we had delivered the goods in Maskat harbour, our part of the contract has been fulfilled, and any re gulations at Maskat, whether they were old or new regulations, have absolutely nothing to do with us. Under these circumstances, we again ask your kind assistance and protec tion to us as British subjects, and to compel these customers to pay the amounts due to us, viz: — Haji All Khan Moosa Khan Abdul Kahim Jaffar You will time, and in accordance with, and particulars of the enclosed statements, notice that we have charged interest on our drafts for the overdue — also allowed interest on the deposit, which is in accordance with the arrange-, ment we have with these customers.It is of the utmost importance to us, that we should receive the sums due to us, which are very large, as quickly as ever possible, as the fact of being without them for so long, is, to say the least, most seriously interfering with our business. Therefore, kindly use your best endeavours on our behalf, and should it be outside your duties as Consul, to take this ma/tter in hand, we should feel much obliged if you could advise us as to what other steps to take to obtain our money.

I am to suggest, for Lord Crewe's consideration, that His Majesty's Consul at Muscat should be consulted by telegram as to the facts of the present case, which are presumably not correctly stated by Messrs. Laubenburg. The firm have been informed that an enquiry will be made into the matter.

Sir: - In reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo in whicb you use ub do submit a statement in writing setting out the points to which we wish to call attention, we beg to state that on the 22nd of July 1912, ’ve shipped by the Steamshap 'Mashona' from Manchester certain rifles and cartridges of the value of £3585.19*0. These rifles and cartridges were properly consigned to Muscat in accordance with the regulations and under .the Permit which we hold from the Sultan dated September 9th, 1908. These goods were, we understand, in accordance with certain regulations recently put into operation at Muscat, put by the Customs Authorities into a bonded warehouse, and we further understand that con signees are not allowed to remove such goods from the bonded warehouse, without first satisfying the Authorities that they will be forwarded to a non- prohibited Hie Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.LA'* If p - ' y t l. v# non-prohibitea area. We are informed that our consignees have produced ! to the British Consul at Muscat unquestionable evidence as to the ultimate destination of the goods in question. f ana that the British Consul nevertheless declines to release them* The result of this wrongful action by the Consul is that our consignees have been unable to obtain these goods, and consequently decline to pay us for these, as well as for other la.rge amounts due to us for previous shipments. The fact that we are being kept out of such a large amount of money owing to this wrongful act of His Majesty's Britannic Consul in Muscat, is haying a most serious effect upon our business both financially and otherwise, and as British subjects we have to request that the Foreign Office will, in the above circumstances, instruct the Consul to immediately release the goons in question. We further request that you will be good enough to grant us an interview to enable us to substantiate the above facts. We are &amp;c., (Signed) C.H.Laubenburg and Companyx^ xV ,X-\ of 1913.

Grey is aware no arms have been seized by the Sultan, but traders are now required to deposit their stocks ina warehouse from Khlch they can be with drawn on the production of proof that the destination of the arms and ammuni tion is free from objection* I am in conclusion to point out that the trade is not prohibited by the new rules issued by the Sultan, but is merely regulated with a view to pre venting the export of arms and ammunition from Muscat to places where the import of such cargoes is illegalopy. 47706H Sir: LION WORKS, WITTON BIRMINGHAM. 8 th November &gt; &gt; 1912. We have the honour to refer to certain corres pondence which we had with you between March 1909 and January 1910, during which period there was a rumour prevalent that the importation of Arms and Ammunition into Muscat was about to be prohibited. We were naturally very much concerned, because the cartridges which we supply for that market, and which have to be prepared a considerable time in advance, are not suitable for any other market. In the latter part of 1909 the writer had an interview with Sir Charles Hardinge with the object of showing what a serious matter it might be for us if the importation were prohibited without warning. Sir Charles was good enough to promise that before any definite steps were taken a reasonable notice would be given to enable us to dispose of whatever work we might have in hand. Since The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Since that time we have done a more or less regular trade with our friends, who specially lay themselves out for the manufacture and supply of Arms for Muscat. Judge of our surprise, therefore, when payment became due for certain goods supplied by us, to be informed by our friends that they were unable to meet our bills because the whole of their goods had been impounded by the Sultan of Muscat, and that they could not take delivery of the other goods specially prepared for them in accordance with their orders and awaiting shipping instructions. We need hardly point out that this is a most serious matter, as the sums involved are considerable, and having regard to all the circumstances, we have the honour to request that such steps be immediately taken as will ensure the release forthwith of the goods v/rongfully seized, and the delivery without let or hindrance of the other goods specially manufactured against orders as hitherto.

CA i BHIDG fi CTHEST, iijf | /ISO''ember 7th, 1912. \ 91 2, J L A —■ » • nlMl —1^1 Sir: - We beg to bring to your notice, that in the year 1800 we started in a small way in connedtion with r. William Field, - a gun-maker and inventor of the 'Field' Military Action Fine - and Sergeant Bates, - both volunteers - to manufacture Martini-Henry Target Rifles, many Queen’s prizes having been won with our rifles at the time. hen this trade came to um end on account of repeating rifles being substituted, we managed to secure orders for Martini rifles for the trade in Muscat. This trade by degrees, soon assumed considerable proportions, and on this account, but principally to meet the severe Belgian and other Continental competition, we went to the expense of erecting special machinery, and took larger premises to cone with the demand. Then in 1899, the trouble arose about the Persian Gulf seizure, when a consignment of ours in the Mteamship The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Beluchistan t aestinod for uscat*, was ssisjod by a British gun-boat, which consignment however, after we had laid our complaints before your Office, was duly released by the direction of the Marquis of Salisbury, as per letter dated Foreign Office April 19th, 1099, and signed Thomas Sanderson. We mention this, because the following paragraph in this letter, viz:- 'Colonel Meade states, that after making full inquiries, M he is satisfied that the case of arms was originally 'intended for uscat, and that it was over-carried to 'Buahire, as it could not be traced in the ship before ’’her departure from Muscat. Under these circumstances, 'he has allowed the case of arms to be re-shipped to 'Muscat for delivery to the owners or their agent.' clearly establishes that we were not doing any unlawful trade with Muscat, and besides, according to the Treaty of / Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, of 139^, made with His Royal Highness the Sultan, we have always considered that we were doing an absolute lawful business in supplying our customers at Muscat with arms and ammunition, irres pective of many other goods; we refer in particular to Article 7 of this Treaty, which says:- 'Bo article whatever shall be prohibited from being 'i mported into, or exported from the territories of 'His Highness the Sultan etc.” Hisills Royal ihighness the Sultan has also favoured us from time to time, with special permits allowing us to supply aims and ammunition to Muscat, and at the present moment we possess one of these special permits, the translation of which reads as follows:- * To All Royal Friends 'from Syed Fasul Bin Syed Toorkee - Sultan of Muscat (Oman). Messrs. C.H. Laubenburg and Company, Birmingham, are 'hereby permitted to import arms and ammunition to Muscat, 'without hindrance, for a period of the next six years 'from the date. ' This is to be treated as a special permission. Date: 12th Shahban 1326 Hijri 9th September 1908 The document is vised by the French Consul. This special permit has therefore another twenty-three months to y run. Having always been convinced, on account of these special permits, as well as by the mentioned letter from the Foreign Office, and by the Treaty of March 19th, 1891, that we jure doing a lawful trade, we have never hesitated to accept orders from our customers for rifles and ammunition, (many of which were high-class sporting rifles - some inlaid : a with real gold), entering into contracts for ammunition with a local manufacturer, and placing contracts for theraw material etc. required for the manufacture of rifles. How you will imagine our anxiety and surprise, when in September we heard from our customers at Muscat, that a shipment we had made by the Steamship 'Mashona', of arras ana ammunition, amounting to a large sum, had been impounded i by His Royal Highness the Sultan, and in consequence, they refused to pay our bills, and not only these bills, but also bills for large sums relating to shipments we made previously by the Steamship ,, Turkistan ,, , although they had obtained their goods from this steamer alright. They further informed us that, - at any rate for the present - they would refuse to accept the goods relating to any un executed orders, amounting to many thousands of rifles and a large quantity of cartridges, and o.s we have a good pro portion of these rifles ready, and the remainder more or less in a forward state, you will readily understand, that the fact of being unable to dispose of these goods elsewhere, being only suitable for the Muscat market, and the fact that the cartridge maker will force us to take delivery of the cartridges, we are confronted with an enormous loss v/hich will nearly spell ruin for us, irrespective of the prospectiveprospective loss of future trade, not only to us, but also to our workmen, all of whom we have had to discharge, and many of them so far, having been unable to find adequate employment. Concerning the very large amounts owing to us by various customers in Muscat, we have written to His Majesty’s Consul asking his assistance in the matter, by compelling these debtors, who we know are very wealthy and well able to pay, to forthwith discharge their liabil ities to us, not only by paying our bills, but also by forcing them to take delivery of the goods still on order with us, but so far, we have not had a reply. We would mention that the 'Mashona* shipment which was seized by His Royal Highness the Sultan, left our warehouse on the 22nd of July last for Manchester, and was properly declared as rifles and ammunition, the bill of lading being made out by our shipping agents - 'to order' - the bills of lading being also duly indorsed by us as shippers. On hearing of the detention of this shipment, we wrote to His Royal Highness the 3ultan, pointing out that\W he had favoured us with special permits for the intro duction of arms and ammunition, asking him to be pleased to release the goods and thus enable our customers to honourably fulfil their engagements to us. /ibout the same time, we also sent a protest to His Majesty’s Consul, io tnese communications we have had no reply so far, nor have we heard that the gooes have been released. Having now put before you a full statement of our case, we humbly beg your kind assistance in this, for us, most serious matter, and to ask you to kindly protect our Rights as British Subjects, by inducing His Royal Highness the Sultan, not only to release the goods to our customers against the production of our bills of lading, but also to press him, in accordance with our special permit and in accordance with the Treaty of March 1891, to permit us to trade in Muscat, to execute our orders without hindrance as hitherto, and to pay us ample damages for the wrongful detention of our goods. In conclusion, we would also remark, that when our representative - Mr. Poole - had an interview with His Hoyal Highness the Sultan at the end of April last, he didI f did not mention a word to him about his intention of stopping the trade or interfering with our special permits, on the contrary, he expressed his pleasure at our doing a large and satisfactory business, and hoped that v/e should do plenty of further business. His action therefore, in stopping the trade and ignoring our permits, is inexplicable to us. Tnis matter, as you will readily understand, on ac count of there being large sums involved and withheld from us, and the fact that we are pressed by our suppliers to pay for amounts owing and to take delivery of the goods still contracted for, is in urgent need of an early settle ment, and we trust that you will kindly deal with it as soon as possiole. Any further information you may require, we shall be pleased to communicate to you, either by letter, or by personal attendance at the Foreign Office. We have, &amp;c., (Signed) C.H.

They have, therofore always favoured us with their orders a long time in advance, but in consequence of the now restrict ionsions, all our customers now refuse to take delivery of their duly placed orders, and wish us to cancel them. Your Royal Highness will, however, easily under stand that it is impossible for us to agree to our friends request, because the orders we have still to execute amount to more than 5000 Rifles and 500 rallies Cartridges of which the latter are quite completed, also many of the Rifles finished or in a forward state* Having done this trade for so many years without any difficulty w© naturally never had any hesitation in accepting and taking in hand any orders our friends favoured us with* Now if our friends are unable on account of the new Restrictions to take delivery of their duly placed con tracts, it will cause us an enormous loss, which Your Royal Highness will surely feel we ought in justice not to suffer* Xle therefore, humbly pray Your Royal Highness to kindly and favourably consider all the oirmmistances of the case, and to allow our friends to take deliveries of the goods still on order, in the usual way, so that they can honorably fulfil their contracts and obligations towards uo* For should our friends at Muscat not fulfil their legal engagements towards us, and not take the Rifles and Ammunition on order, our loss will certainly not be less than £*10,000, as these respective goods will be absolutely unsaleable elsewhere, and conseqiiently be worth nothing, neither have we any further use for our costly machinery* Trusting that you will kindly help fts and favour ably consider our very hard case* ' lifPut away wi &gt; ■ V,'' 4 i 28th September 1912.

I have already t Id you in a chit telegram that the manifest form (b) of the regulations of 11th; July had been duly prepared and handed over to Syud Kasim by the Captain oi the 'Mashona' . In that manfest, Louie Dieu had A talcen the precaution to enter his name as consignee practically throughout the manifest . I am far from sayi ig that this amounts to an incorrect or insufficient description under rale 8. ’but it puts the Frenchman in a quandery . .huch of the stuff is not for aim at all and a large consignment at an events is for All noos§ whom, with the consent of the Sultan , I have interviewed at length this morning , All Moosa declalrs that he holds the in voice and thlnXs that the bill of lading is addressed to him but the rules f I think it is obvious from Rules s &amp; e refuse to recognise as consignee any one except the indivi ual named xn manifest form (b) . All Moosa does not in the le at want to take delivery and, as far as X can make out , stands in the fortunate position of holding £ 1,800 against a deposit of j 6 00(2) ln tne hands of the Birmingham Manufacturers . This £ 1,300 represents arras and ammunition, of which he has tejten possesion by the curious ( en famine ) ^angement which obtains between tae local merchants and the local Customs at Mastat. While the ' 131118 of ladlng - on whloh ^e Birmingham merchants were fondly relying^were safely deposited m a Bombay -an* , All Moosa paid the duty on the stuff and secured delivery from the Customs Superintendent Abdul Karim .

Dear Sir Percy, I enclose with this, in continuation of my demi-offi cial letter No.181 of 19th, copies of Invoice and connected correspondence between the Field Rifle Company of Birming ham and Ali Khan. Ali Khan himself produced these but I could no doubt get similar documents from other consignees, for the marks on the boxes betray them. The French have so far put in no protest about the 'Mashona” consignments and it leaps to the eyes, as they say, that, if they do, they will be claiming compensation for Agency rights which but for those regulations of which they complain so bitterly they Yrauld never have secured. It shows what a complicated question this business of compensation will be, should the Hague decide to let them have compensation. This is, I think, an important point and should not be lost sight of. If you agree, per haps it will be as well for me to go very fully into the question now, before people begin to iorget their MaSiiona H ^ I could then submit cargo or lose the pacers connected therewith/a confiden tial official report on the 'Mashone' cargo in which I would hope to show how very little was really French.

PRODUCTION OF TABLE GRAPES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LOT-ET-GARONNE (FRANCE). H.M. Consul at Bordeaux (Mr. R. D. G. Macdonald) has forwarded the following memorandum on the production of table grapes in the department of Lot-et-Garonne : The cultivators of the Lot-et-Garonne, who have hitherto only made small experimental shipments of fresh grapes to the United Kingdom, held an exhibition of fruit on 4th October, 1908, at which the variety, size and quality of the fruit displayed was remaiTable, and certainly justified their belief that such produce vould find ready acceptance in British markets if it were better known, and it suitable arrangements could be made for its rapid (aniage and arrival in good condition and at favourable prices. . ^ e P' r een Agen and Tonneins on the right bank of the Garonne nver there lies a region, of which the town of Port-Sainte-Marie is the agricultural centre, which may be described as a Rhine in miniature, where a range of low hills sloping towards the river catches the full rays of the sun and produces and ripens in abundance fruit of such excellence as the Nicole Apricots and Port- k. amt e-Marie grapes, some varieties of which are described below. I he Chasselas Dore or Golden Chasselas grape of Port-Sainte- i ane, where the fruit show above referred to w r as held under the patronage of the French Government is said to compare favourably wi he famous Chasselas of Thomery. It is a small, round and very jmcy fruit of delicate and sweet rather than full flavour, turning when quite ripe from white to a light golden colour. The ulogramme (2-2 lbs.) averages from 7 to 8 bunches. It is the most extensively cultivated of all the table varieties in the district.Dec. 24, 1908.] THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL. 601 Production of Table Grapes in the Department of Lot-et-Garonne (France). The exhibition at Port-Sainte-Marie has clearly shown that the black grapes of the district are of a quality to be appreciated at Covent Garden, whilst the natural productiveness of the soil guarantees that the quantity can be developed to cope with any possible demand. The varieties of black grapes which could be exported in considerable quantities are :— 1. The Calabre or Oeillade, a long, heavy, clean-grained bunch (from 3 to 5 bunches to the kilogramme), and long stalk; very large, regular oval or ovoid grapes, covered with bloom; pulp firm and full flavoured. 2. The Big Colman or Toko or Dodrelabi—large bunches; very large round grapes ; pulp firm and tasty. The Hamburg Muscat is another variety of very fine flavour. The Servant, a large green grape covered with bloom and with a hard skin, is considered to be a fruit of the future. The following are the prices of grapes in the Port-Sainte-Marie district, of which Agen is the Administrative Centre with a Prefec ture and a Chamber of Commerce :— Golden Chasselas ... 40 fr. (32i?.) per 100 kilos. (220 lbs.). Calabre ... ... 30 fr. (24s.) ,, ,, Cost of packing from 6 to 10 fr. (5s. to 8s.) ,, „ The cost of railway transport, reckoned from Agen to Boulogne, under the General Tariff No. 34 for perishable commodities, for a minimum of 50 kilos. (110 lbs.), is 117’25 fr. (93s. 10^.) per metric ton. For quantities of 5,000 kilos., or 5 metric tons, the above tariff is reduced to 108‘25 fr. (86s. 7d .) per metric ton. Shipping and railway charges from Boulogne to London are calculated at about 50 fr. (40s.) per metric ton, to which should be added:—Cartage on arrival, 5 to 6 fr. (4s. to 4s 10L) per ton ; local charges on arrival, Id. per package. It should, therefore, be possible to sell these grapes in London at from 70 to 80 fr. (56s. to 64s.) per 100 kilos. (220 lbs.), or from 3£d. to id . per lb. In order to facilitate the exportation of this delicate commodity, which must reach its destination in perfect condition, the Orleans Railway Company and the Compagnie du Nord have established a service of trains timed so that the goods shall reach London the day following that of their despatch. Any delay of whatsoever nature is certain to be disastrous, and will discourage future efforts to develop a commerce in which rapidity and punctuality of transport are vital. _ „ From a report published in the “ Revue de Viticulture oi 8th October, 1908, it appears that a certain quantity of French grapes from the districts of Avignon and Aix were shown at the Franco-British Exhibition in London. The packing was found to602 THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL, [Dec. 24, 1908. Production of Table Grapes in the Department of Lot-et-Garonne (France). be defective in too many instances, the grapes having suffered from not being sufficiently tightly packed in their cases. Fruit packed in cork dust arrived, as a rule, intact, but its appearance was no longer fresh. The stalks had dried, and the bloom, on which the marketable value of the grapes depends, had disappeared. The best method of packing is thought by some to be in baskets of which four or more are attached together, the Iruit being packed as tightly as possible and the bunches wrapped separately in soft paper. It might, however, be found that packing in boxes would also give satisfactory results, provided that the bunches were placed tightly in rows and enveloped in paper so that they could not shift under vibration. Cases somewhat larger than those con taining 5 kilos. (11 lbs.) used for the interior French tiade, might be employed for export. Whilst arrangements can be made in France to avoid more than one operation of transfer for these goods from the station of depar ture to the port of shipment, greater difficulties are experienced on arrival at the latter, where the cases or baskets require to be handled several times in passing from the railway wagon to the platform and thence to the ship’s deck and holds, and undergo a rough treatment which does greater inj ury to the fruit than the whole of the rest of its journey. The same inconvenience is under gone at the port of arrival in England. It is suggested that operations of loading and discharging might be greatly facilitated by the use of frames or boxes such as are employed in shipping and landing passengers’ luggage, whereby a great number of cases or baskets of fruit could be swung on board or ashore at one time. Having regard to the many widely separated districts in France from which fruit is shipped, and to the consequent fact that it is impossible to collect together wagon loads of even two tons, the French Railway Companies could not everywhere establish anything like a system of special boxes for its manipulation, but it might be feasible and advantageous for the English and Irench lines most interested in the development of the trade to study the question of centralising it at certain places where such measures could be taken. The formation of some special organisation for the sale of French fruit in the United Kingdom would also seem to be worthy of consideration. The President of the Chamber of Commerce at Agen, Lot-et- Garonne, will furnish the names and addresses of the principal shippers of fruit to any enquirers.Dec. 24, 1908.J THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL. 603 INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE DUTCH EAST INDIES. » . H.M. Legation at the Hague has forwai’ded a memorandum, drawn up from Dutch Parliamentary Papers, in regard to the expenditure of 3,333,000Z. on the internal development of the Netherlands East Indies, from which the following particulars are extracted:— In 1905 the Netherlands took over a debt of the Netherlands East Indies, amounting approximately to 3,333,000Z. The interest on, and amortisation of, this debt, are consequently now borne by the Netherlands Treasury, thereby relieving the Netherlands East Indian Budget of an annual burden which, for 1905, amounted to 100,000Z. The consequence of this arrangement is that the necessary funds for carrying out the scheme for the economic development of the East Indies have to be found by means of loans issued by the Colony itself, with a resulting annual increase of its expenditure on account of interest. In this manner the Netherlands East Indian Government will be able to spend, on behalf of the economic measures they consider necessary, a total capital, the interest on which is equal to the sum which they save annually owing to the above-mentioned transfer of debt. The Government are now able to pay for a considerable part of the projected works from this saving, and loans need only be issued for the payment of such portion of those works as cannot be met from the said saving. In this way the financial assistance afforded by the Netherlands will last longer than would be the case if the whole of the expenditure for the internal development of the Netherland East Indies were to be met from loans. The main features of the measures in question, described by the Minister of the Colonies in a Parliamentary document of 1904, are as follows:— Irrigation — (a) Improvement of irrigation from the Sindopradja and Doetamati waterducts (Cheribon) ; (b) Improvement of irrigation and drainage of West Brebes between the Losari and Babakan Rivers (Pekalongan); (c) Improvement of irrigation and drainage of the depart ments of Pemalang and Pekalongan, east of the Tjomal (Pekalongan) ; {d) Improvement of irrigation and drainage of the southern part of Bagelen east of the Lok-oeloe (Kedoe) ; (e) Improvement and extension of irrigation in the depart ments of Magetan and Ngawi (Madioen) ; (/') Improvement of irrigation in the basin of the Sampean River and of the drainage of South Panaroekan (Besoeki) ;604 THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL.

Supply of Credit to the Native Population :— Financial assistance to private agricultural credit institutions. —A number of private agricultural credit institutions were to be furnished with a loan of 833Z. each, free of interest for the time being, but on the con dition that so long as the Government demanded no interest, a sum, equal to that to which such interest would otherwise have amounted, should be paid every year into the reserve fund of the banking establishment concerned, with a view to pro moting the speedy formation of a reserve, and in that manner to cause the financial assistance afforded to serve to increase the financial strength of the institutions. Establishment of a State agricultural credit bank. —The Govern ment, moreover, proposed to establish a State agricultural credit bank in the Preanger Regencies by way of experiment. Measures dealing with the promotion of cattle and horse breeding, the construction of new roads and the improvement of existing ones were also proposed to be undertaken. In reference to the foregoing scheme, H.M. Legation points out that, according to the preliminary report of the Section of the Second Chamber of the Netherlands States General examining the East Indian estimates for 1909, a total sum of 550*000^. only had been expended during the years 1905-7.Dec. 24, 1908.] THE BOAED OF TEADE JOT7ENAL. EXPORT CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN FOR BRITISH REFINED SUGAR CONSIGNED TO CERTAIN BRITISH COLONIES, POSSESSIONS AND PROTECTORATES. The following Memorandum on the subject of Export Certificates of Origin for consignments of British refined sugar to British Colonies, Possessions and Protectorates has been issued by the Commissioners of H.M. Customs for the information of refiners and exporters:— Memorandum. 1. In order to meet the requirements of the sugar export trade, the Commissioners of Customs have, at the request of the Board of Trade and with the concurrence of the Colonial Office, instructed their Collectors to furnish, on application, export certificates of origin in respect of British refined sugar to be exported to British Colonies and Possessions which place restrictions on the importation of Russian or bounty-fed sugar. 2. To exempt British refined sugar from these Colonial restric tions, it must be accompanied on exportation by a certificate in an approved form (Appendix A). The certificate will be to the effect that the sugar particularised therein has been manufactured in the United Kingdom from raw sugar originating in the countries endorsed on the certificate, and it will be issued subject to the conditions set out in the succeeding paragraphs. 3. The raw sugar, from which the sugar to be exported was manufactured, must have been accompanied on importation by a certificate of origin, issued by the fiscal authority of the country ot export in similar form to that hitherto accepted, which would enable it to be identified as not being the produce of any State (including Russia) which has been declared by the Permanent Sugar Commission to give bounties on the production or export of sugar. Certificates issued by fiscal authorities in States which are not parties to the Sugar Convention, must also show that the sugar referred to is derived from a factory which does not work sugar from any bounty-giving State (including Russia), and must, as a guarantee of due signature and issue, be vised by the proper British Consul or Vice-Consul. 4. Raw sugars, for which w r hen refined an export certificate will be required, are on receipt into the refinery to be stowed apart and distinguished by mark from uncertificated raw sugars. 5. Refined sugar produced in refineries from the time when any raw sugar, unaccompanied on importation by the certificate referred to in paragraph 8, has been introduced into the manufacturing processes until twelve working days after the last of such raw sugar has been actually placed in the melting pan, will be held to be ineligible for an export certificate bearing the names on non bounty-giving countries only. 6. Refined sugars, which are eligible for the issue of export certificates and for which such certificates will be required, must be kept separate from other refined sugars in the refinery ware-THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL.

Applications for export certificates must be accompanied by the refiner’s declaration, stating that no sugar originating in any bounty-giving country (including Russia) has been used in the manufacture of the refined sugar for which an export certificate of origin is desired, and adding the names of the countries in which the raw sugar originated. 8. Duty-paid refined sugar ineligible for an export certificate at the time of delivery will, if deposited in a refinery for re-refining, remain ineligible for an export certificate of the kind above indicated. 9. Certificates in the approved form will, if desired, be issued on application by exporters in respect of sugar to be exported to any British Colony, Possession, or Protectorate, provided the conditions set out in paragraphs 3 to 7 above have been fully observed.

[Dec. 24, 1908- Shipping and Transport. SWITZERLAND. Navigation of the Rhine from Strasbourg to Basle. With reference to the notice on pp. 96-7 of the “ Board of Trade Journal” of 9th April, 1908, the British Vice- Consul at Zurich (Mr. J. C. Milligan) reports that during the last five years the question has been under consideration of utilising the natural waterway up the Rhine from Strasburg to Basle for goods traffic. It is estimated that the cost of the project would not exceed the sum of 1,600,000^., and it would be the means of opening up direct communication between the Lower Rhine and the Lake of Constance on the one hand, and Zurich, Lucerne, Aarau, Solothurn, Bienne and Yverdon on the other. Goods ti'affic up the Rhine from Strasburg to Basle was main tained during 1907, but the increase since 1906 has not been im portant owing to the exceptional condition of freights on the Lower Rhine during the summer of 1907. In the meantime the harbour at Basle has been completed and a company has been formed, with a concession of 20 years from the Government of the canton of Basle, for unloading vessels and for the transfer of goods to the railway and vice versa. The Rhine goods traffic to Basle has been suspended for this year (1908), but it is hoped that next year it wffll be increased fourfold. A firm in Mannheim purpose placing 5 steamers and 15 barges on this service, and as other companies will organise similar services, the tonnage traffic in 1909 should reach upwards of 50,000 tons, if the arrangments for unloading on the trains can be improved, During the year 1908 the tonnage carried during the navigation season amounted to 15,000 tons.

It extends from Pasco, on the Northern Pacific main line, for 221 miles to Vancouver, and thence crossing the Columbia and W illamette rivers, for 10 miles to Portland. Thirty-three miles of the Portland end and 20 miles of the Pasco end are double tracked. A large wharf and warehouses are being built at the Portland terminus to facilitate the loading of deep-sea vessels. 1 he principal object of the railway is to avoid the expen sive carriage of goods over the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound, and the result must be a very great increase in the volume of wheat and other produce brought into Portland for export.

The output of balata for the year 1907-8 was 973,269 lbs as against 634,242 lbs. last year. The quantity of rubber produced 2 ? fi o a f° f 6 . a * er ’ 6 ’ 87 , 3 . lbs ' ha ™g b een gathered a S P against 2,563 lbs. in the preceding year. The price of balata was fairly maintained, whilst that of rubber fell. Licences for the collection of balata were previously limited to three years, but in response to a general demand for a longer period they are now being issued tor Id years, and 164 more licences were taken out in 1907-8 than in the previous year. The report gives the following particulars of the cultivation of dlst March a ^ 08 CO ™ nuts m the coJon Y during the year ended The acreage under rice increased from 26,568 acres in 1906-7 to 29,715 acres in 1907-8. The cultivation of Rice. ^ this grain was first seriously taken up about 1898, when there were some 6,477 acres devoted to it, and the acreage has steadily increased year by year Ihe importation has fallen from 25,060,493 lbs. in 1898 to 2,126,557 lbs. in 1907-8, while in the same period the export has risen from nothing to 6,977,877 lbs., valued at 59,037Z. So far the land has been prepared and the crop dealt with by manuai abour, but proposals are maturing for the introduction of the latest labour-saving appliances. As a subsidiary industry to sugar rice is taking a very important place. Ihe area under cacao was 1,761 acres—practically the same as last^ year. Possibly the very heavy weather Cacao. during the earlier part of the year caused some curtailment of the area devoted to this crop. A broad and extensive belt of the Colony is undoubtedly capable of greatly increased production of cacao. The export was 60,105 lbs. in 1907-8 as against 50,033 lbs. in 1906-7. The area under coconuts continues slowly to increase: the cultivation is returned at 6,810 acres. Some Coconuts. 631,705 nuts were shipped during the year.

The Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade has for several years been in the habit of forwarding to Chambers of Commerce for the confidential use of their members, but not for publication, information (chiefly as to openings abroad for British trade) to which it has appeared desirable in the interests of British trade to draw attention confidentially. The plan met with general approval, and last year, in order to attain more fully the purpose of the Board, namely, to reach all British manufac turers or traders interested, it was decided, on the recom mendation of the Commercial Intelligence Committee, to sup plement the above-mentioned system by opening at the Com mercial Intelligence Branch, 73, Basinghall Street, E.C., a Register of British firms who might desire to receive confidential information relative to their respective trades. The Register was opened in January, 1907, and a considerable number of British firms have since applied and had their names entered. British firms desiring to have their names entered on this Register should fill up and forward to the Commercial Intelligence Branch a form of application, copies of which may be obtained at the offices of the Branch. The admission to the Register, as well as the retention upon it, of any firm is at the discretion of the Board of Trade. No charge is made for information supplied, but every firm admitted to the Register is required to become a subscriber to the “ Board of Trade Journal ” (and to register as such with the sale agents, Messrs. Wyman &amp; Sons, Limited, Fetter Lane, London, E.C.), in order to ensure that those who are desirous of receiving such confidential information should first be in possession of all the official information relating to their particular trade which is published in that Journal. The annual subscription to the Journal, including postage, is 15s. 2d. The present scheme is provisional and experimental, and its continuance and future development will depend on the results of experience. Note. —Apart from the special Register, the Branch is always ready, as far as possible, to answer enquiries on specific questions in the interest of British trade.632 THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL. [Dec. 24, 1908. Commercial intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade.

The three Governments engage to make joint representations to the Negus with a view to the prohibition, in accordance with the provisions of the General Act of Brussels, of the traffic in arms and ammunition in Abyssinian territory. 4. As regards the supervision of dhows trading for arms from Jibuti, Aden, Perim, Zeila, Massawah, Assab, and other ports of those regions to points outside the zone of protection defined by the Act of Brussels, measures will be taken to prevent them from smuggling. 5. While expressly maintaining the principles of French legis lation in regard to the right of visit, and it being agreed that the British and Italian Governments maintain their principles in regard to this question, the French Government agrees that the measures of control exercised by the local authorities in British and Italian territorial waters over small British and Italian native merchant craft (dhows) shall be also applicable in Italian and British territorial waters to dhows flying the French flag. The British and Italian Governments also agree that the measures of control exercised by the local authorities in French territorial waters over small French native merchant craft (dhows) shall also be applicable to dhows flying the British or Italian flags. These measures shall be inforced without necessitating a recourse to the formalities laid down by the Consular Conventions in force between the three Governments. 6. In order to facilitate the supervision of native craft, and in order to prevent any wrongful use of the flag, the three Govern ments engage to communicate to each other every year a list of the dhows authorized to fly their respective flags. 7. The three Governments will further see that the dhow owners authorized to fly the French, British, or Italian flag shall show such plain marks on their craft as will permit of easy recognition at a distance. 8. The British, French, and Italian Governments agree to instruct their respective local authorities to concert amongst themselves as to the best means of carrying out the measures to be taken as the result of this Agreement. 9. The present Agreement shall hold good for a period of twelve years from the date of signature, and shall then remain in force for periods of three years, unless it is denounced six months before.

We have delayed acknowledging the above in the hope that we should hear from you in regard to the particular point which Mr. Eudison raised at the interview in question respecting Persian Sulf business, viz: why the British manufacturer or trader should be compelled go comply with certain Regulations which do not exist in, or, at any rate, are not enforced by, Continental countries interested in that market, We need scarcely repeat that this one-sided arrangement is most detrimental to British trade generally, and the result is that a trade which is carried on in a perfectly legitimate manner is again being driven to the Continent.

These include:The Board of Trade Journal (December 24, 1908, Volume LXIII, No. 630) with sections on openings for British trade, tariff changes and regulations, and shipping, mineral and agriculture (ff 141- 179).'Agreement between the United Kingdom, France and Italy respecting the importation of arms and ammunition into Abyssynia (Treaty Series No.7, signed London, December 13,1906)A notice 'Arms Traffic.
