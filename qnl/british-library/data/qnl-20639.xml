Please regard the contents as particularly confidential. As you will see, there is nothing to be done for the present. I am sending a similar letter to Brenan and Seal. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) M.

BELGRAVE, DATED 18th OCTOBER,1936. Yesterday Skliros came to see me here. He told me that the directors had had a meeting and the gist of their decision was that the company want a concession over all the 'additional area' for which they will pay what they offered 'before. A concession over part of the 'additional area' only is of no use to them and they do not wish to compete for it. This means that each company wants all or nothing and the Shaikh’s idea of dividing the 'additional area' is unacceptable to both companies. x x x x x I have told the Shaikh, as I told you, that it is my personal opinion that it would be of greater benefit for Bahrain to have two separate companies working there, in fact that it would be better to give the 'additional area' to the Petroleum Concessions Ltd. I think it is possible that when I see him and talk to him about the whole question he will appreciate my argument and' may decide to give the concession to the Petroleum Concessions Ltd. It would be better if he decided to do this without pressure, therefore. I would like to have the opportunity to talk to him about it before he is advised to decide definitely. I hope to reach Bahrain on 1st or 2nd November.tr I P.Z. 7421/36. PERSIAN GULP OIL (TRUGIAL COAST). IDENTIAL. Mr.Ballantyne called on the 14th October and said that his object was to convey a message from Standard Oil of California. He suggested for consideration that it might be convenient for him# in addition to his usual functions as representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, to form a link betv/een the parent company (Standard Oil) and the India Office in regard to Persian Gulf matters outside Bahrein. For instance, he had recently spoken to the India Office on behalf of the ’’Calarabian” Company about the question of surveying the waters of the Gulf off the Hasa Coast. I said that I could not express any opinion about his suggestion but that prlma facie there might be advantages in it merely from the point of view of convenience: it was hov/ever important to remember in anj' case that the immediate responsibility of the India Office was confined to the Gulf and did not cover Saudi Arabian matters. Ivlr.Ballantyne’s message from Standard Oil, which he then delivered, was that they had now definitely decided to interest themselves in the possibility of oil concessions on the Trucial Coast. He explained that the Company had of course some time ago been approached by various Trucial Sheikhs but for various reasons they had held off from that Coast. . They now felt that in existing circumstances it would be worth their while to go in and see what they could get. They fully appreciated that any concessions secured would have to be approved by His Majesty T s Government in due course, in view of the Treaty obligations of the Sheikhs: these// X 2. these ohligations did not appear to him to necessitate any prior reference to His Majesty's Government before negotiations were begun but the Company thought it right to inform His Majesty's Government what was in their mind. I promised to report what Mr-Ballantyne said. I said that I could express no opinion on it, and asked that he should not take silence on my part at our interview, or on the part of the India Office subsequently, as in any way giving any kind of implied approval to the Company's intentions. He said that was quite understood. Incidentally I asked Mr.Ballantyne whether the Company had yet taken any steps to get in touch with any Sheikhs. He said that so far as he knew they had not: their decision had only been taken quite recently. Mr.Hamilton would probably be going down to Bahrein shortly to carry on negotiations over the unallotted area of Bahrein. He (Mr.Ballantyne) thought it quite possible that the Company might want to use Mr.Hamilton at the same time for any Trucial negotiations. ©.Miisew OFFICE. . 10* 1936-4963 2000 7 36 By Air Mail.

I tliini: I told you verbally some days ago, but should now like to cordTinn in writing, that we have understood From Mr. Belgrave that the Shaikh of Bahrain appears averse from giving to P.C.L. a concession for the area for which we nave applied, namely, the unallotted part of Bahrain Island ana all the other islands under his rule. He seenio, on the contrary, to favour the idea of giving us the hawar group, and possibly one or two other islands, but not the unallotted part of Bahrain, nor the larger islands near its coast. ...h(^Company considers that it has, from more than one p oint of view, a high claim to be allotted the areas for which it has applied, and feels that the allotment of a further area to the Standard Oil Conrpany of California vcu_ he.vc a definitely adverse effect upon our prospects 0“ successful negotiation on the Trucial Coast. We have, therefore, told Belgrave that we remain candidates for the whole area for wnich we have applied and for which we have made a very generous offer, and we are not disposed to be interested in anything less* We should, meanwhile, view ■ ;lth some the allotment of any further area to the Galiiorniansj who had not&gt; we helieve* made any step towards ashing for it until we entered the field - and who have, to all appearances, everything of any obvious value in that group of islands already. uson Esq., ^hite&amp;tli, S.W.l.

My Company are reluctant to believe that the Shaikh wishes to disregard his previous recognition of the preferential treatment to which the Company are entitled. Nevertheless, if the Company must eon- l tinue to bargain for the Additional Area, they are prepared to do so, and should this be necessary the Company believe they are justified in assuming that, at the very least, they will be afforded equal oppor tunities, with respect to any competitors, as to the manner and extent of such bargaining. In other words, my Company, having already done so much for Bahrein, should have an opportunity of fair bargaining with any others who may appear interested in acquiring the Additional Area, The Company cannot believe that they are faced with the juxtaposition of a rival concern who would appear to have no claim whatever to be con sidered in preference to the Company, . I am sending you this letter in triplicate in order to facilitate your bringing it to the notice of the Shaikh and his Advisers, My Company would appreciate it very much if you would arrange to do this as soon as possible so that negotiations may be resumed without further delay, and I hope, with successful results, I am also sending two copies of this latter to Mr. Ballantyne in London, Tours very truly, / I.

Mr. C.Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.H. (Adviser to the Bahrain Government). Major F.Holmes, Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Mr. E.Packer, » « « 1. Major Holmes presented to Mr.Belgrave the Bahrain Concession (unallotted area) 1937 Draft for his examine- tion and consideration. Mej or Holmes indicated two amendments not previously brought to Mr.Belgrave’s notice. (a) Addition to Article 1. 'But if duriig the currency of this agreement the territorial limits of the Sheikhdom of Bahrain should be extended then the Shaikh agrees that the area covered by this concession agreement will be co-terminous with such extended territorial limits.' (b) Ah amendment covering certain limited drilling operations on the Ruler’s pleasure island of Um-Nisan. &gt;yith reference to 1 (a) Mr. Belgrave appreciated the Company's point of view and accepted the amendment. (This provides for any situations similar to that which has arisen over zubarah (Qatar). (b) with reference to 1 (b) Mr. Belgrave reiterated ; that / 2 .- 2 - &amp; that H.H. the present Ruler held strong views on this ' matter and was very .nuch against any Oil Company opera- tions on Un-Nisan. Major Holmes pressed for the inclusion of Um-Nisan in the concession area if necess ary with well-defined and limited rights as regards drilling or other operations. A form of compromise was discussed, vi 2 .- that the island should be included in the concession area with the reservation that noworh should tahe place without the specific approval of the Ruler. It was brought to notice that it was desirable to Provide against the contingency that the Ruler or his successors might change their point of view regarding Urn Hisan in which case the Company holding the concession would have no protection against possible opposing xnterests unless some such conpromise was included in tile agreement. Mr. Belgrave agreed to rais#* +V 10 4-4 uo raise tne question of Um again with H.H. the Ruler with a view to obtaining either Ixmited rights to drill (which Mr.Belgrave thought unlikely) or at inset ,, at least protection for the Company getting the concession ac-ainat f.,t„, gainst future complications (described above). Mr.Belgrave accepted all tv,„ „*v.

Major Holmes shewed him that this was provided for in terms which should be satisfactory to the Ruler in the Concession agreement and Mr .Belgrave agreed. In reply to a question by Major Holmes Mr.Belgrave stated that he considered that he would need about a week (not longer) to consult H.H. the Ruler and get his decisions* Majior Holmes intimated that he expected to return to Sharjah (and D u bai) on May 2nd.

Dear Sir, The fil^h^^i^cussion about negotiations for the Additional Area was held on May S, 1937 between Mr. C.Dalrymple Belgrave and Mr.^.Hamilton and it was men tioned to you that evening by Mr.Hamilton. Mr.Hamilton pointed out reasons to Mr.Belgrave why it seemed fair that after such prolonged negotiations the Sheikh might be asked if he would wish to reconsider his recent de cision, so that the present negotiations might be con tinued and some decision in the matter reached. Mr. Belgrave agreed to reopen the subject with the Sheikh. Mr. Belgrave did so yesterday morning. Sheikhs Abdullah and Sulaiman were also present with His High ness. Neither His Highness nor the others present wished to reopen the negotiations. They wished Mr.Belgrave to point out that exactly the same message was given to each Company so neither Company should feel that any particular discrimination was made in its case. The position, therefore, remains the same as that reported to you in ay letter No.PA-204 of May 1 , 1937 . s' Yours very truly, / Sd/- E*A.Skinner.

Dear Mr. Valton, As you know, we were desirous some months ago of obtaining a concession for the unallotted portion of the Bahrain Group of Islands. le appeared to be on the point of obtaining this when the Shaikh requested a , P0StpOnement ° f ne g°ti a tions for twelve months, owing to S' thS dlfferenoe ^ich had arisen between him and the Shaikh of Qatar regarding Zubarah Information now reaches us from Bahrain to the effect that the Shaikh would in all probability be willing give us axi the unallotted territory, on terms already substantially agreed between him and Major Holmes, acting on our behalf, provided that a clause be inserted in the concession agreement that 'no effort would be made to develop the oil resources of the Zubarah area'. Zubarah is, of course, on the mainland of Qatar and therefore included in our fetar concession. As have ratmed that concession (with its description of the C0Vered ’ ^ itS ma P attached) we assume your vi,w to - that Zubaran is part of the territory already granted us y 106 Shalkh ° f QatRr - Thus if the undertaking now f0r the Sh ^kh of Bahrain we should appear tc be “Sking for the same territory twice over, and also, by 'Plication, admitting the Bahrain claim to Zubarah, which w °uld be hotly resented by the Shaikh of Qatar. At/At the same time we remain anxious to obtain the unallotted portion of the 3ahrain Islands, and we feel that a formula for these could perhaps be found which would leave the Zubarah question completely on one side. Might this be done, for instance, by emphasisin, the word 'Islands', that is, by asking for 'the unallotted portion of Bahrain Island and all the other Islands under the Sovereignty of the Shaikh of Bahrain?' Do you think that the Political Resident would be able to advise the Shaikh that a concession in these terms would do nothing to deprive him of any claims to Zubarah (on the mainland) which he might ultimately be able to substantiate? ' Je feel at the moment some difficulty about proceeuing further with active operations on Qatar until we have obtained rights over the Bahrain group since the latter include the Hawar Islands; if, for example, investigations proved Qatar to be valuable, this would be likely to create intensive competition for the Hawar Group. Yours sincerely, ^ l (^G.) Stephen H.

His Majesty's Government would not, of course, be able, in any event, to agree to any alteration of the wording of the draft Concession which would give the ■iheikh the impression that they are prepared to recognise his claim to Zubarah. S-K - ^ongrigg. Esq., Petroleum Concessions, Etc City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, o, 2 . (S«L) J- WAT/TON.-3- &gt; n) claims to Zubarah and the ncre remote possibility 0 f bis being able to substantiate such claims, it was unfortunate that this point was overlooked at the time but overlooked it was, and it remains for us to see whether the ratification of the Oil Agreement in any W£y COafflitted His Ma J e sty's Government with regard to the definition of the area w U nder the rule of the Shaikh of Qatar.' From an examination of Article g of the Qatar Oil Concession I am inclined to the view that His Majes ty's Government are in no way committed, for the state of Qatar is defined as being 'the whole area over which the Shaikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached to this Agreement.' If the Shaikh of Bahrain eventually succeeds in proving his claim to the area known as Zubarah then ipso facto the Shaikh of Qatar cannot^said to rule over that area and, therefore, that area cannot be considered as part ° f tnt ' State ° f Qatar&lt; However, I do not think it ad visable to reply to that part of the Company's leUe ' which deals with this point at the moment. 6. The second point raised by the Company, i. e . the possibility of their emphasising the word 'Islands' does not appear difficult and I can see no harm in their in- uding^a^formula similar to the one suggested in their letter under reference but I would suggest that they speci fically state what is understood by the Bahrain Islands. They might, for instance, motion 'the unallotted portion of the island of Bahrain and the other Islands constituting the Bahrain group' and in addition I would prefer to see a Hat of islands which are said by them and by the Shaikh to constitute the Bahrain group so that there can be no question/- fc'i srJ I so that His Highness* attitude was that with regard to the Zubarah question he was pared to waive any pos sible oil rights that he might have had in that area. If his claim was upheld then he waives his rights; if j hiS WaS ^ ^ naturally the point does not arise, it would now appear, if the information con- tained in the Company* s letter is to be accepted literal- ^ ^ H1S HighneSS ’ alrea ^ assur ed us that the ' ' qUeSti ° n ° f hlS Claim Zubarah would not affect the Oil Lease and that he had no objection to the development of Oil in the area, is now endeavouring to prevent the deve lopment of the Zubarah area by the inclusion of a clause - in the Agreement for the Bahrain unallotted area. This amounts to an allegation that His Highness is indulging in what can only be described as double-dealing, x self do not for one moment believe that it tI . • Leve waa-c it was His High- »«»' intention to s „ „„ hl3 of ^ ^ ^ 10 W «■'» ■»= . gr . at dnl of . l5 . understanding.

The solution would/-would be for the Ruler of Bahrain and the Ruler of Qatar to agree that the Zubarah area be held b y the Ruler of Bahrain as the personal property of the Shaikhs of Bah ia, and that His Majesty's Government should be re quested to agree to this compromise with the proviso that the mineral rights, i.e. oil, etcetera, m that area remain vested^, the shaikh of Qatar and that Petro leum ConcessionsZLimited who are the Conpany operating in the Qatar Peninsula should have every right of access for the development and working of Oil that might be lo cated in that area. Although the possibility of the two Bulers agreeing m this is by no means certain, I think it not unlikely that some such suggestion will be put for ward in the not very distant future as I have reasons to believe that various influential personages whose interest are proportionately divided between the two States are doxng their utmost to bringing about a settlement of the Zubarah question.

Mr. Longrigg also asked my advice on the ques tion of the formula to be used in describing the area for which a concession should be sought, in order to obviate the possibility of Zubarah becoming a stumbling block. He suggested referring to the Unallotted Area ' of Ksnaaah Island (assuming that his Company continued to bid for that), plug other islands of the Bahrain Croup, which were to be definitely named. I said that I thought it would be very wise to proceed on these lines, if only for the purpose of obviating any future d ° Ubt aS t&amp; thee xtent of their Concession, if they obtained one.

Now, however, that the P.C.L. want to commence negotiations with the Sheikh concerning this area in which hawar is situated, H.II.G. will have to give a decision as the Company will want to know before entering on negotiations whether Hawar does or does not belong to Bahrein. 3* The sane remarkn rnj jatis mutandis apply to the island of Fasht Diha]. 4» I suggest one following action (a) a D-tter to he written hy me as Political Resident under instructions from H.il.G. to the Sheikh oi ipatar, iniorming him that in connection with negotiations which certain Companies are about to commence the question of the ownership of Kawar and Pasht Uibal must be decided. On the evidence at present available to H.M.G. these islands appear to belong to the Sheikh oi Bahrein. H.M.G., however, have reason to believe that he, the Sheikh of Qatar, may wish to advance claims to these islands. if so he should submit these claims to H.M.G. within a certain period (say two months) from the d^te of the ietter, after which no claims should be considered. (d) a letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein enclosing a copy of the letter to the Sheikh of Qatar and explaining that when the the latter’s reply has Been/2. been received it vould be communicated to him? the Sheikh of Bahrein. The latter will then have an opportunity of rebutting the claim of the Sheikh of Qatar should the latter advance one. (c) a second letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein referring to letter (b) and asking him if he would be good enoug to postpone negotiations with the Companies concerned until the ownership of Kawar and Pasht Dibal have been decided. ‘ fa K* cc^ • r 7 / o:0 * (d) a letter to be sent to the P.C.L. and to Bapco. informing them of the action taken. 5* The possible objection to the above line of action is that it may put ideas into the head of the Sheikh of Qatar. However, I am pretty sure that the ideas are there already and we cannot risk the muddle that would ensue if, after the P.C.L. and Bapco. had commenced negotiations on the ass .mption that the islands belong to Bahrein, the Sheikh of atar were to come forward with a sound claim. Cpart from this it is only fair, I think, to „atar, to give him an opportunity of having his say* 6 . From the political point of view it will suit quite well if we give Hawar to Bahrein, as this will balance our previous decision of giving kubara tp^^atar. 7* With regard to para. 3 of your note. ^s you suggest I think we should get the advice of the P. 0 , as to whether there is any objection. Sd. T.0. Powle 5/4p. Z.2412/38. Immediate. IP PI A Cl-PIOE/ 7th April, 1038 :e A \oM 5$ Dear Brenan, y/ r °uld you kindly^efer to the correspondence ending with Bushire letter So.C-379 of the 8 th December, x1.j7, (a copy of which was sent to the loroirn Office 'with India Office printed letter Ho.1.2.8137/37 of the 81st December, 1937) regarding the negotiations for the n Bahrein unalloted area 11 ? I,ast ; 8 ay (see enclosure to our printed letter ho.r.-Z.3824/37 of the ISth June, 1937) Belgrave informed the Iolitical Agent, Bahrein, that the Sheikh had decided to postpone all discussions and negotiations regarding the unallotted area for one year, and, as you will see from the enclosed copy of a telegram dated 31st March, 1938, the oificiating Political Resident, the Bahrein Government have recently confirmed their intention not to resume negotiations until the year's interval ends. In tne normal way, therefore, we may expect negotiations to recommence sometime after 1st May, but, as will be apparent from the ensuing, a complication has arisen. 3. Last week Mr. Lewisohn and Kr. Longrigg called here on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in order to leave the/ • Brenan, Esq., OBE., Foreign Office.the 'Bahrein unallotted area' and to say that the Company wished to know whether H.Ik G, have any objection to their applying to the Sheikh (at the appropriate time) for a concession over the two areas indicated in the •Sk-^Js^'P° attached to the drait concession. Ihe Company are anxious lor an early decision in order that everything should 'be in readiness for the time when the Sheikh indicates his willingness to open discussions. .we have taken t he opportunity of Bowie’s presence here to discuss the question with him, and I do not think 1 can do 'better than to send you a copy of our Minutes. Prima lp.9-k9. Powle 1 s proposal to get the Sheikh to postpone negotiations until the ownership of the Hawar and other islands has been decided appears to be the best solution, and, subject to any views which the Foreign Office may have to offer, it is proposed to proceed on lines ... A indicated in paragraph 4 of his Pote.^T^ ** As the matter is of some urgency we should he grateful for an early reply, and in due course we shall be glad to have your advice in regard to the point dealt with in paragraph 3 of Symon’s note.^^V^^ 5. Would you kindly return the draft concession with your reply. Yours sincerely,P.Z.2727/1538. (E 1985/413/91) Immediate. 13th April, 1938. Dear G-ibscn, / X \ I write in reply to your letter P.2.2412/38 of the 7th April about the resumption of oil negotiations for the 'Bahrein unallotted area' and the question cf the ownership of Pasht Dibal and the Hawar Group of islands. 2 * In view of the impending oil negotiations we j.eel that a decision on this question will be convenient and we agree with the views expressed by Fowle in paragraph 5 of his minute of*the 5th April and with the proposed procedure for ascertaining the attitude of the Sheikh of Qatar before oil negotiations are resumed. • be think it should be made clear to the company that any decision taken with regard to the sovereignty or ownersnip&gt; 01 the islands only holds good to the extent that His Majesty T s Government are in a position to take and enforce a decision i.e. as between one Protected State and another, and cannot be held to preclude.His Majesty 1 s Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign Power which may hereafter put forward a claim to the islands if His Majesty's Government in their sole discretion | think it expedient to admit that claim. This may be a purely formal reservation in the present case, but we do not want to tie our hands against the unforeseen, in the way that we tied them over Jebel iTaksh by undertaking obligations to a private company about the territory of an ■ Arab ruler. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)T.V. Brenan. ■ Gibson Esq.I &lt;$&gt; in D -ecord 01 an Informal Meeting held at the India Office on the 12th April, to discuss the activities of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. P R S S ENT : Mr.R.T. Peel (in the Chair) Sir T.Fowle) ) Mr.Gibson ) India Office. ) Mr.Symon ) M r.Lewisohn)R e pr e s enting )petroleum Mr.Longrigg)Cone essions Limit ed . Mr. Longrigg opened the discussion by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, viz:- A. The position in regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone; 13. xhe position in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted Area; c. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. With regard to A (the Koweit Neutral Zone), Mr.Longrigg said that as a result of our refusal to sllow^iM S*: Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the irucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connection'^ ■ it: x-etr oleum Concessions, Ltd. , and the Company were m ^ w afraid that he might now resume his connection with the B i . &gt; California Company. Major Holmes was now at Koweit to^*£7 * * ~ 3 consult with the Sheikh regarding the Neutral Zone and i'* 5 * owing to his influence with the Sheikh the:/ were apprehensi'/e lest he might persuade the Sheikh to give the concession to American interests before Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a further opportunity of putting forward their proposals. Mr.Longrigg then went on to express the hope tnat His Majesty’s Government might soja their way to discourage American interests, or at least to ensure that tue oneikh did not cede his oil rights in the Neutral Zone until Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a fair opportunity/opportunity o: competing. He was promised that t he .■ oinpany' s viys would receive c onsideration. 3. Ni th regard to B (the Bahrein Unallotted Area), Mr.Longrigg referred to his previous call on the 31st March, at which he had left a. copy of the Company’s draft lease relating to parts of the Bahrein Unallotted Area and ne said that here again the Company were concerned about trie future intentions of Major Holmes, who was fully informed as to their proposals. The Company were satisfied that there was little chance of the Sheikh of Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted Area and that they had been led to believe that the Sheikh intended to give everything except the Hawar Group of islands to the Americans. ?or this reason they had departed from their original intention to compete for the whole of the Unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the main island out of their plans, they w r anted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty’s Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of the draft concession. / Sir Trenchard Bowie intervened at this stage to point out that the Company's proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Fasht Dibal) whose ownership as between Bahrein and Qatar had not yet been clearly determined. While on the evidence at present available to His Majesty's Government these islands belonged to Bahrein there was reason to suppose that the Sheikh of Qatar might wish to advance claims to them and he thought that it might be preferable to ask the Sheikh of Bahrein to postpone the resumption of negotiations for a short period (say two or three months) in order that the question of ownership could be finally determined. This suggestion/3. A As k This seems to be the case - In the 0,a t ar c one es s i on (Article 2) the State of Q,atar is defined as 'the whole of the area over which the Sheikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached t o the Agreement.' A. C . B. S. 19.4.38. suggestion had been put to Lord 0adman in a recent conversation and it was understood that His Lordship was agreeable. Mr.Longrigg said, however, that the Company i 5r ere opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would be a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sneikh of Qatar. He pointed out, moreover, that if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to V the oheikh of Qatar, they would be included in the concession which tne Company had already obtained from that Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein for them, the Company were merely running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The Company were prepared to take this chance and would definitely prefer to carry on with the negotiations without any postponement. Sir Trenchard Fowl* said that he had not appreciated the latter point and that in the circumstances he ^was in clined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing ^ e . ne £ °tiat ions . Miw Feel wound up this part of the djspussj pn by s aying that the viewg put forward on. behalf ?.onsidered..and that a decision wo uld be given as soon as possible. P oVa ^ 0 * 4. With regard to C (the Trucial Coast, etc.), Hr.Longrigg said that there were two separate points, viz: (1) Concessions; (2) Exploration. kith regard to (l) (Concessions), the present position o.iat the company had obtained concessions in respect of -ecai and Sharjah; but so far all efforts to induce the renaming Sheikhs to come into line had proved unavailing. A' ' r ' r a ° ' as reasonably possible, the Company had met the various demands put forward by the Sheikhs and he thought that fully adequate terms had been offered; but the Sheikhs seemed/y seemed to be completely out of hand and appeared to be convinced that eventually they could get whatever terms they liked to ask. A state of deadlock had been reached and the Company felt that unless Kis Mayiosty’s Government were prepared to intervene, the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiators. Asked for his were left alone, for say six months, they would probably come however, that in oil matters waiting usually resulted in bigger demands and he thought that delay in coming to terms / might make it more difficult for the Sheikhs to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised waiting, the Company would of course accept his advice, but they hoped tint it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters. Mr. L e wisohn then asked if the Company cou ld regar d their pres ent privileged position as watertight and wa s inf ormed tha t for t he present, at any rat e. they had no need t o worry on thi s sco re. Mr. Lev/isohn then went on to say that he thought that the Political agreement might have something to do with the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah' 3 refusal to come to terms and he asked whether His Majesty's Government regarded it as essential to obtain the Sheikh’s agreement. Mr. Longrigg agreed with his colleague and suggested that the terms of the agreement were sufficiently binding 'n the Company without bringing in the Sheikhs. Mr. Peel pointed out, however, that as t wo of the Sheikhs , \ namely Deoai and Sharjah, had recognised the agreements, it / might b o difficu lt not to follow the same procedur e in the 1 case o f the others, but he promised t hat the que stion would be re-examined . As regards exploration, Mr. Longrigg said that from the Company’s xooint of view, the present situation was views, Sir Trenchard Powle said he thought that if the Sheikhs round and accept the Company’s offers. Longrigg said / completely/completely unsatisfactory. He said that although much of the territory concerned could probably be written off as valueless., some parts appeared to have definite interest \ and they must see it all. Up to the present the Company's efforts to visit certain 'interesting' areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheilchs ; had been unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial Sheikhs alone for the time being . and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan / during the latter’s recent visit to London and had been told \ that in addition to certain parts of Muscat territory ? the i Sultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (which the Sultan claimed belonged to him) through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg said that this suggesti o n seemed to offer greater promise of getting something done and he enouired v/hethcr it might not be possible for His Majesty's Government to i co-operate with the Sultan . He was promis ed that the point would be considere d. 5. Sir Trenchard Fowle mentioned that during his recent conversation with Lord Cadman he had been asked to suggest the name of a suitable person to act for Petroleum Concessions Limited in connection with the forthcoming negotiations at Bahrein and Xoweit. Sir T. Powle said that normally he i would hesitate to give advice, but as the present ) circumstances were somewhat peculiar he was prepared to do / so. The names which occurred to him -ere Messrs.Longrigg, J Lermitto and Packer and he said that so far as the local ( Political authorities were concerned, all these gentlemen ) would be acceptable. He also thought that they would be j acceptable to the Rulers concerned. \ A.C.B.S. CIA OFFICE. 12th April 1938,1. Whitehall, P.Z.2727/38. 20th April, 1938. IIviMEiilAT ii. My dear Brenan, Would you kinuly refer to your letter of the 13th / April (ho.k, 19do/4l0)/91) and Part (B) of the enclosed record of a further discussion with representatives of I-etroleum Concessions Liniited about the resuinption of oil negotiations for the 'Bahrein unallotted area' 9 ^Mio As you will see from the record of the discussion on 12th April, Powle is now prepared to wi tharav; his suggestion xor postponing the negotiations and in the light of the representations put forward on behalf of the Company we are inclined to tell them forthwith that so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned there is no objection to their applying to the Sheikh of Bahrein (at the appropriate time) for a concession over the two areas indicated in the maps attached to the draft concession, subject to any reservation which the Foreign Office may cpnsiaer desirable in regard to non-territorial vaters . At the same time it would be made clear to the Company Brenan, Esq. 0 . B&gt;Et oreign Office, S.W.l. that /'l b © that any decision subsequently taken with regard to the sovereignty or ownership of the isian ..s or reefs included in the proposed concession areas will only hold good to the extent that His Majesty's Government are in a position to take and enforce a decision, i.e. as between one protected State ana another, and cannot be held to preclude His Majesty’s Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign 'Power which may hereafter put forward a claim to the islands or reefs if His Majesty’s Government in their sole discretion think it expedient to admit that claim. We should be glaa to hear as soon as possible whether the Foreign Office agree with the above procedure, and, if so, what reservation, if any, should be made regarding non-territorial waters. If we act on the lines suggested we must, of course, explain the position to the Shaikh of Bahrein and it is possible that he himself may wish to postpone negotiations until the question of ownership has been settled; but we shall have aone our best, from the Company’s point of view, if we tell them now that so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, and subject to the warning we propose to give them./a .7 is clear to negotiate on tae basis of their draft lease.

M. 25th April, 1930. I'ly dear Gibson, ./e have been considering your letter P.Z. 2727/38 of the 20 th April about the resumption of negotiations for the “Bahrein unallotted area ;i . In the light of the further discussions which you have held witn the representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited we agree generally, subject to a suggestion by Beckett, referred to below, to the line which the India Office propose to take in their reply to the Company regardin . their not further postponing their approach to the Sheikh. Beckett has made certain suggestiprfsGis regards the wording of the second part of Article 1 of the Draft Lease, a copy of which formed an enclosure to your letterGf ^the 7th April and which I now return, and I cannot do better than send you a copy of his minute herewith. if his suggestion as regards the substitution of the words 'submerged land for 'waters' is adopted there wii 0 f course be no need to use in your reply to the Company the •words underlined in paragraph 2 of your letter. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal and Starling. Yours sincerely, Sd. T.V. Brenan Gibson Esq_./ * r FOREIGN OFFICE, S. .1. S2288/413/91) * There are two points on which I should like to say something, the first concerns the Havar group of islands. The position here is as I understand it, that these islands probably belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but may conceivably belong to the Sheikh of 4atur or even to Ibn Saud. The company wish to secure the rights over these islands by this concession on the assumption that they belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. if th ey belong to the Sheikh of ,atar they have already got rights over them under their agreement with Qatar and if they should turn out to belong to Ibn Saud they realise that neither this proposed agreement nor the agreement with Qatar will give them any rights there and that they are not getting any guarantees by H.M.G. that a claim by Ibn Saud will not be recognised by them. This being the position, it seems to be to be better to word the '‘Secondly- in Article 1 of the draft concession as follows. 'The whole of that portion of the Sheikh's dominions (leased area No. 2) including all islands, reefs, shoals and waters belonging to the Sheikh withm the following boundary limits . . .. &gt;' The boundary limits winch are defined by geographical co-ordinates clearly go round the Hawar group of islands and therefore if they belong to the Sheikh the concession covers them. On the other hand, the fact that they are not mentioned in this way by name avoids the difficulty that the concession definitely contains a statement that the islands do belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. This way of treating the matter seems to me to be/be more appropriate in vie'/ of the circumstances indicated above. Then there is che point about territorial waters which arises a.s I understand it in this way. The proposed concession relers to all waters within the proposed leased area, and the area includes waters outside 3 mile limit, but it cannot oe incended that the oil should actually be extracted from the sea v/ater and the intention I think must be to obtain the right to extract oil from the land under the sea within this area and this point is relevant because so far as the water is concerned not only does the Sheikh have no right over water outside the three mile limit but also in the ordinary way he cannot acquire by occupation or prescription any sovereignty over such water. On the other hand, as regards the sea bed and the land under the bed, although the Sheikh has at present no righ/o to such land outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and one l&lt;,.nd under it is capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. .and indeed both pearl fisheries and Cornish tin mines which extend beyond the three mile limit are held to have been appropriated in this w y. Consequently, I should thin: that it would be better to substitute for the word 'waters* 1 the words -submerged land*', so that the phrase a. ould run islands, re^is, shoals and submerged land belonging to the Sheikh comprised ' The effect of this would be that the company would get the right to the land below the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as they had appropriated it, its appropriation by the company having the effect I think of also vesting i t in the Sheimh i rom the point of view ox 1 sovereignty since the company are working under a concession from the Sheikh/-1 Sheikh, ■’■t an y rate the insertion of the phrase to the Sheikh' gets over any difficulties from our viev/ as regards territorial waters.

Later correspondence relates to the Shaikh’s decision to split the unalloted area into two concessions with the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) being granted the remaining area on the main island and some territorial waters including Sitrah Island; and Petroleum Concessions Limited (PCL) being granted the Hawar Group of Islands and a number of other territorial islands and waters along with an allocated site at Muharraq for use in constructing a refinery and storage areas.Also included is continued discussion around the question of ownership of the Hawar Islands and Fasht Dibal [Fasht ad Dībal]. The India Office concluded that their evidence supported the Shaikh of Bahrain’s claim to the islands and that therefore responsibility for disputing the claim lay with any other potential claimants. The question under discussion however was whether to make the Shaikh of Qatar, as the other potential claimant, aware of their conclusions.Other matters discussed in the volume include:the question of oil rights to Zubarah, which had been granted under the Qatar Oil Concession, and the assurance given by the Shaikh of Bahrain to His Majesty’s Government that should his claim of ownership to Zubarah be recognised it would not affect the Qatar Oil Company’s work in that area;notes on a meeting at the India Office with Hamilton R Ballantyne, a representative of the Standard Oil Company of California who were interested in oil concessions on the Trucial Coast as well as the unalloted area of Bahrain.discussion regarding Major Frank Holmes’ actions during his work for PCL in 1936/1937 on the Trucial Coast and the Political Resident’s wish to prevent him from travelling to Bahrain or the Trucial Coast in order to prevent further potential confusion and intrigue. Also reported on is a conversation between the Political Agent at Kuwait and Major Holmes at which Holmes' vision for oil concessions to drill under the pearl banks between Bahrain and Qatar is revealed.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 193-200.The correspondence with the Shaikh of Bahrain and various draft concession documents are in English and Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Fasht Dibal</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hawar Islands</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000297#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
