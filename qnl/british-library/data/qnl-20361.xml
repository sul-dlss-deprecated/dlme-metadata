In a recent interview Sheik Yusuf Yasin asked me whether I had heard in Cairo anything about the Saudi Arabian (governments prospects of obtaining loan irom the United States. J replied that though Yusuf Yasm must not take what I said a« an official statement, I could say from what I had gathered th«re was little or no hope. 2. The following day Yusuf Yasin showed me a note received that morning from the United States Minister at Cairo, the sense of which is briefly as follows: the commitments of the United States are already enomous and must be confined to those zones where the special interests of the United States are involved. Saudi Arabia is not a country to which the United States can, under the lease lend Act, advance money and is, moreover, territory regarded as within the British' sphere of influence, in view of the great friendship existing between treat Britain and Saudi Arabia, 'ery great help has, as is known, been given and is being given to His MajestyVs Grovemment. Thus, whilst fully sympathising with Ibn 3aud r s difficulties and expressing their readiness to help in any other way which the Samdi Arabian (rov^rnrnent may deem useful, the United States (iovemment cannot grant the loan requested. 5. yusuf Yasin said that the King appealed to the United States because he was ashamed to ask His Majesty's (government for further ie fcy lltv - • ^ -fc, X A lax .

On receiving report of ray conversation Yusuf Yasin ordered the Minister of finance to give me a full and frank statement of the financial position instruorting him at the same time not to ask for any given sum bu- to leave it to me to decide in light of figures sibmitted what help could reasonably be asked of His Majesty r s Grovernment. 2. Figures reveal most dangerous sta-e of affairs. For three years before the war average annual expenditure was approsimately £3,000.000 of which rather less than £2,000,000 was met by customs and pilgrim dues and internal taxation, and the remaining £1,000,000 represented payments by oil and. concessionary companies. In 1941 expenditure has increased by about £750,000 arid revenue^allen by nearly £1,800,000. His Majesty's Government made loans amounting to £600,DOO and ^ave 10,000.500 riyals, worth roughly £800,000 or £1,400,000 (sic). There will thus ue debt of £1,150,000 in 1941 owing for supplies obtained on credit; and to the Government officials for arrears of salary. 3. Increase in espenditure is attributable almost entirely to increased distribution of money and 25 food, not only to Neja tribesmen who suffered from a drought, but to Heiazi townsmen who have been reduced to poverty owing to falling off of pilgrimage. 4. Decrease of revenue is due to the following causes: (a) H-reatly decreased number of pilgrims. (b) Heduced customs revenues. Not only have imposts decreased owing to lack of pilgrims, especially of tne richer'type from Ja.va end Malay, but duties have had to be~ reduced by 25% to enable impoverished population to buy imported goods. (c) Drought resulted in death and slaughter owing to lack of pasture of a large proportion of animals and the agricultural tax, where not abolished, produced little. 5. The Minister of Finance does not foresee any improvement in the situation in '1942 and the position will thus be as follows:- Estimated expenditure based on 1941 figures, £3,700,000. Estimated revenue (including £750,000 which the Saudi Arabian Government expects to receive from oil companies) £1,000,000. The Government must thus find £2,700,000 Tor 1942 and have debts con- 5 3 r?? t:,ec * 1^41 amounting to £1,150,000. iheir total ^quirements till the end of 1942 are thus £3,850,000. Of this sum they are, it is stated, in immediate need of at least £250,000.idi- ; un- bhe Ef fby looqj ;V iibilltdTea 0 6 ihe Minister of finance promised t.o study the possibilities of economics but. as the only obvious economy consists in curbing ibn Saud's generosity he is on delicate ground. lbn t 3aua T s generosity, is moreover, one*'of the qualities which helps him 'o maintain his arip on the country. ^Expenditure on an efficient standing amy is avoided by his distri 1 v t ion of money and Good to the Nejdis, and his gifts' to Heiazi townsmen have not only increased his popularity in Hejaz but have probably proved much less expensive than would have been a properly regulated 'dole'. ?• in giving me figures the Minister of finance said that ibn Saud r had hoped to avoid asking His Majesty's Government for more than they had hitherto so generously given him and had therefore appealed to the United States U-overnment for 10,000,000 dollars which sum would, if His Majesty's Government had continued to help him to the extent of £500,000 a year, have enabled him to carry on. He read the United States not^-to mean that whilst the United States GrOvemmen f ©ould not afford direct help they thought His Majesty's n-overnment would help out of funds to be placed at their aispbsal under lend-lease Act. 8. I have discussed figures with the manager of Oalifomian Arabian Standard Oil 'Jompany who thinks that if his company can.advance 3,000,000 dollars (ne has had no indication that they will be able to do so), £3,000,000 is a fair estimate of Saudi Arabian Government's requirements for 1942 and confirms that in his opinion they are in immediate need of a minimum of £250,000. Thou, ' h these siffl s» if made available, would fall short of the k tTcrtal estimate44they should enable the Government to carry on at least as good a hand to mouth existence as in the past year. 9. In submitting these facts and figures for your consideration I would stress the point that any help gov en to Ibn Saud must now be regarded not so much as a reward to him for his good behaviriuB but as a war measure aimed at preventing the collapse of his regime, a collapse whose consequences might well cost His Majesty's Government more millions than those required to maintain it. ^xt.7281/41 .

Jedda, December 6. 1941. ioSHIR E RESIDENCY. 'our No -y'r Me : Enclosure 1. 'Colonel De Gaury to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. Sir, Riyadh, November 12, 1941. I ARRIVED in Riyadh in the mid-afternoon of the 12th November. The King at once sent to ask whether I would prefer to be received immediately or after darl I told the Chamberlain, Tabaishi, that I would prefer the later audience. I was therefore biddeuto come at 3 o'clock Arab time (about 8.30 p.m .). We were lodged in the Murabba Palace and so only had a few yards to walk. On the way through the corridors of the Palace some of the soldiers were brushed aside by a chamberlain to reveal the brightly painted gates of His Majesty's new lift. The King looked extremely well, unchanged since 1939, and received me cordially. After the usual exchange of compliments, I told him that it had been thought that he might like to discuss with me our management of tribal affairs in Syria. His Majesty immediately showed that he had been made fully aware, by you, of the objects of my visit and that he much appreciated the courtesy of sending someone au courant with affairs in the north to visit him. He said, making use, for the first time with me, of the expression akhui (my brother), that he would like to discuss this and also affairs in Iraq when we were alone : at audiences which would begin to-morrow. Nevertheless, he began to discuss Iraq immediately, giving me a number of details about the events leading up to the debacle of May 1941, and describing the arrival here in Riyadh of Naji Suwaidi and his own attitude in regard to the latter. This is, no doubt, well known to His Majesty's Legation in Jedda, and to the embassy in Bagdad, and in any case is not of much consequence now; but the fact that Ibn Saud, immediately on my arrival, embarked on this now old history made me think that he is still perturbed at what His Majesty's Government may think of his having painted Rashid Ali less blackly than that odious Iraqi deserves. This audience was, of course, intended to be merely a formal one on arrival, and we reverted for a short time to non-political subjects—the lift and the King's health; the latter being extremely good, the former out of order! It was not, however, for long that the King could keep off politics and within a few minutes he was discussing the movements of Jemal al Hussaini and he said that he would show me to-morrow a letter to him from Jemal, which I would find very interesting. From this he went lightly off to the heavy subject of Arab Federation, saying that, as he had often pointed out to Arab politicians, the fact that there had not been spontantaneous concerting of plans, either in regard to the Jews or in regard to this war—the two greatest problems with which living Arabs were ever likely to be faced^—showed how little real hope there was for a [25-12] B4, successful federation. In a few quick words, interlaced with classical and Bedouin quotations, lie conveyed to my mind that if we were seriously interested xn Arab Federation we should certainly have to give the necessary impetus to it ourselves. This was the only hope for federation. The Arabs owed everything to Britain. It was she who had given them their freedom and who maintained their freedom for them to-day. As Lord Allenby had once said, if we leave Egypt to-morrow morning, the Greeks will be in by the evening.' (I do not know his authority for this statement or if he really meant Greeks, but that is what he said.) The Arabs had no determination in construction and were easily susceptible to disintegration. A thousand Germans, if they had reached Iraq, could have so shaken the Middle East structure, which we had built up, that it would have collapsed and twenty-five years of laborious effort on our part would have, come crashing about our ears in irretrievable ruin. He had been greatly relieved at the speed with which we had been able to restore the loyal regime in Iraq. This shows, I hope, sufficiently well the general trend of Ibn Saud's conversation at my opening audience. About half way through it, Khalid al Qaraghani, the Tripolitan politician and secretary to His Majesty, had slipped into the room through a side door but had seated himself out of earshot. A few minutes later H.R.H. The Grown Prince came in and our conversation was interrupted for a moment whilst I took leave to greet him. Mr. Uniacke was present with me. If you see no objection would you please send a copy of this letter to the Minister of State and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre at Headquarters Middle East, Cairo. ' I have, &amp;c. GERALD de GAURY. i ! Enclosure 2. Colonel De Gaury to Mr. Stonekewer-Bird. ^ r ' Riyadh, 'Noveinher 13, 1941. IN. this letter I have the honour to continue my report on audiences of Ibn Saud at Riyadh. Before being received by him this morning I had asked to be taken to the Crown Prince, whose morning reception rooms are also in the Old Palace of Feisal, inside the city walls, the St. James's Palace of Riyadh, as it were. The gateways, the pillared covered ways and the sanded corridors were, as is usual, filled with Bedouin visitors, soldiers and bodyguardsmen. H.R.H. the Emir conversed politely on various subjects, and offered us the loan of mares to ride in the afternoons. He made appreciative reference to the cinematograph films sent to His Majesty by the embassy in Bagdad, and would like more. They are very short ones, it seems. Ibn Saud received me alone and talked at great length—for more than an hour and a half. He began by speaking of Syria. At first he seemed a little guarded, and he is evidently not very happy about that country, but guarded as he was about our actions, he did not avoid expressing his opinion of the Free French, t£ the corrupt Frenchmen who had even stolen food sent bv the British for the relief of the Syrians.' He said that everyone knew about this, their untrustworthiness and their threatening of those who were friendly to or visited the British, and presumably I knew this too. I had to acknowledge that I had heard such things said For a moment he seemed about to become rather heated. I asked him about control m the desert, and he showed that he knew about the Commission of Enquiry at Deir ez Zor and the events preceding it I said that we hoped for a better system soon. His own contribution was a rather surprising one. He said that if we could find the right man, which would be the difficulty, we should appoint a delegate or commissioner (' mandoub ') for desert affairs to work from a base m Iraq. cow I asked him again, to make sure where the seat of the commissioner should be. He said Iraq, from where he would be able to contact all the tribes. 0\2V I' I • m m ' ^ 3 I suppose that he hoped that the commissioner would be in contact with him, too, if he were based in Iraq, and he certainly has a very high regard for Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, under whose direction, I suppose, the commissioner would work. With regard to the frontier of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, he said that he was ready to agree to one or two British representatives to arbitrate, adding that the American surveyors (for demarcation) could be employed if we desired. He said: 'We are used to working with them,' meaning the surveyors of C.A.S.O.C.; a suggestion to which, I presume, the Iraqi Government would object. He thought that an alternative and better idea would be to make a neutral zone the whole length of the frontier. The treaties in question and the articles in them about the frontier were made under our direction, and we should not shirk our responsibilities in regard to them now at the final stage. It was desirable to simplify matters as soon as possible—there were too many 'papers' now. It was very confusing. All might be scrapped and embodied in a single new document once the frontier was settled, but he felt quite certain that nothing would be done unless we pressed the Iraq Government. With regard to Jadaidat al Arar, he used almost precisely the same words as Mr. Edmonds, and thought that it should not be difficult to settle. Nuri as Said had spoken equally hopeful, if more plaintively, and had said that they (Iraq) were ready to accept British, American or Egyptian arbitration. ' Tell Ibn Saud that we will accept you as arbitrator,' he said. Throughout this talk Ibn Saud's theme seemed to be that the Arab countries, his own concluded, were dependent upon Britain for their existence and that we must take a greater measure of responsibility in helping them if they were to live through the coming strain upon them. He gave as an instance of this what had happened in Iraq recently. We had washed our hands clean of her internal affairs and had allowed her army to become politicians to a man, from the drummers up to the C.I.G.S. He became very animated in describing the iniquity of such a policy. The Iraqis and other Arabs were not suited to such developments. The guilt was ours. In peace time we should have two great military centres whence we could move troops quickly. The local armies now should have with them British officers who spoke the language, and they should not be allowed to go beyond a limited strength in armaments or numbers. We must dictate to Iraq this child of our creation if it were not to be a nuisance to itself, to us and to its neighbours repeatedly. London had been partly reduced to dust by German bombers, and he could see no point in failing to face the realities of the present situation or the danger in the future. Thanks to the British Government, food prices were on the whole still quite low in Arabia. He seemed to be satisfied with this, which had worried him so much in 1939, and about the pilgrimage situation. He produced the letter from Jemal al Hussaini he had promised to show me. It was from Tehran and deplored their present quandary. If this letter is a criterion, the Hussaini hopes are low, despite the German advance in Russia. He said that Jemal was the best of the family. He had heard that I was going off to the Yemen, and if that were so, he would help me to go by road. It was not such a bad road and if the Imam agreed to my going, all arrangements would be made by him (Ibn Saud). He said: ' Yahya is a good man, but hopelessly ill-informed of what is going on, the poor wretch (' al meskeen '), because of the pro-Italian clique round him', Raghib, the Prince Ahmed, and the others who are all working for the enemy.' A visit would be a good thing, and he would send letters for me.' At this point the chiming clock interrupted us to strike midday, the hour of prayer, and I took the opportunity it gave to seek His Majesty's leave to withdraw. I have tried to reduce this lengthy talk into its essence, but with such an animated and rapid talker, flitting rapidly among the affairs of several countries at once, it is not an easy thing to do. I have, &amp;c. GERALD de GAURY. [25—12]4 Enclosure 3. Colonel De Gaury to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. ^ T, rp-rTTCj .

We started off by discussing his family. • whetlier Mansour were the eigth or ninth son. He laughingly admitted his ignorance, and we had to count his sons on our fino:ers. which were not enough. 0 ki This gave me an opportunity to make an allusion, in the biblical style, to the blessing by (rod of his stock and, after a moment of reflection, to say that other tamilies were not so blessed. He then touched on the question of the Syrian Monarchy, saying without wif aCe ^ hesitation, ' the best thing for that country is to remain a republic. Where there is no suitable man, why put in a puppet. A king without kingly attributes is worse than useless.' ^ ^ said .^ a t in re g a rd to the Syrian Desert, we really must come to an agreement with the French He kept on repeating this, and how the French ti?v IT ng h 6 0 if®', res P onsive us when we first entered the and V1S t ^ offi ? lals now - This was an impossible situation, and we should take steps to terminate xt one way or another.

(InS &amp; Z'of\() his low opinion of Nuri, and read to me his letters from Egypt asking for Ibn Saud's help against his own country, Iraq.) Do you want me to give you my advice in a nutshell ? Do what you know is right for the Arabs, whether they agree or not, because they never will agree. They must always be somewhat frightened of you. You will never alter them in a thousand years. You can suit your policy to them if you will, but it is useless expecting them to turn themselves into different people, and if you continue to expect them to do so you will be gravely disappointed and they will suffer seriously. ' I have said before that some of those clever officials of London should be especially appointed to form an office to study and deal with Arab matters.' It was in this way that the torrent of His Majesty's talk ran on, like the spates in the wadis of his own Jebel Tuwaik; suddenly, forcefully, they pour out, to run this way and that, some quickly losing themselves, others flooding on' carrying everything before them; whilst here and there a side trickle, small though it may be, is at least refreshing and enjoyable. I thanked His Majesty for his offer to facilitate our journey to the Yemen, and he said that he had telegraphed already to the Emir Feisal, Viceroy of the Hejaz, about it, and that such was the least he could do and unworthy of thanks. He would always help us where and when he could. I have, &amp;c. GERALD DE GAURY. Enclosure 4. Colonel De Gaury to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. ^ r ' Riyadh, November 14, 1941. AT my final audience this night, His Majesty was again most erood- humoured and cordial. He told me that it was unlikely that he would go to the Pilgrimage this season, although he would go down later to see the Diplomatic Corps and Mr. Kirk, the Minister for the United States, resident in Cairo. Meanwhile, he is leaving Riyadh this evening for his camp at Ramah. He said that he had just heard that the Resident in the Persian Gulf and political agent m Bahrein were visiting Dhahran for three days. The ofticials m the Gulf , he said, were all good men. The adviser, whom the SheTEF ot Bahrein had sensibly accepted some years ago, had done wonders. It used to be a dirty village—Bahrein was now in excellent order, thanks to that very good man. He went on to speak of Sheikh Ahmed of Koweit's refusel to take advice or seek counsel. ^ He, Ibn Saud had tried to give him good advice, but Ahmed habitually said Ei, Ei, and did nothing. His family, the Subah, were restless again, and he was not surprised. Ahmed was a friend of his in a way, and he could never forget the debt he owed to Mubarak, his grandfather, but he thought his politics deplorable. He had heard of the project for a railway, which was £™ g o n K W ^ m ' aS . 11 ? r ~ bered 11 bein g dis cnssed by the authorities when he was a boy m Koweit, forty-five years ago. , Th ® sheikhs of the Trucial coast were in a bad way.

Both called unon separately^on two (xicasions and conversed at length. Khalid is an amateur of uropean foreign affairs and the war. Although he is not outwardly pro-Germanhe seems to feel that the Germans will win the war. He spoke of the likelihood 0 t T r key Germany as soon as the Russian armies were running harder, the bait being a share in the Caucasus, ifcs oil and the lure of new Turkoman subjects. I was able to dig out this fox} Khalid was, of course, in Berlin just before the war, having been sent on a mission to buy arms, and could hardly have helped being impressed by the then untarnished German army. It might be worth while persuading some acquaintances of his in Cairo, of whom, no doubt, he has a number, among the intelliqentsia, to write him encouraging letters. I wondered, when I was talking to him, if such persons would not be fit recipients of bulletins, in private letter form, on the lines of the newsletters which used to have rather a large circulation in English just before and early in the war— Secret History of the Week,' Commander Stephen King-Hall's news- letter^and so on They could be typed and space left for address and signature. He spoke of his having fought the Abadhis, who were the staunchest troops t k a i? j 118 111 ^ or ^ 1 ^-f r i ca - He was, he said, the rebel commander in the V Jebel Akhdar, the very centre of the Abadhi country, and he has a very hiffh j opinion of them m so far as native troops go.

He is mostlv mterested m Arabia and Arabian politics. He gave me useful vignettes of the Yemen notables, which I hope to have the opportunity to check for myself later. He gave, as did Ibn Saud, an agreeable picture of the Imam, describing him as lively and sympathetic in conversation ana not at all like the dour man he had pictured. He was convinced that he could be turned to our side, but one must era very slowly. He repeated this, saying again that he was ready to be won over His advisers, pro-Italian to a man, had already lost a lot of ground. He, Bashir was most anxious to see the Italians sent out of the Yemen : out of Arabia We might think that they did not do much harm now, but if the German armies , advanced nearer they formed a strong point for Axis intrigue. There was I i . th \^kadhi tribesmen of the Jebel Akhdar {i.e., east of the I Kuba-al-Khah m the Ibadhi Imamate, supposed to be in the Oman Sultanate, but m reality not administered by the Sultan at all. Both the Abadhi centres jm bouth-Last Arabia and in ^orth Africa are called the Jebel Akhdar). The | connexion with the Italians in the Yemen seemed obvious. ^ m oney is rare in the Yemen. What would be thought nothing at all m Saudi Arabia was counted a fortune there. Raghib Bey, the Foreign Minister, is paid by the Italians a thousand riyals per month and others downwards m that scale When Bashir was there, Raghib had frankly tried to wm him over to the Italians, and offered to arrange for him to be paid too He had tried to persuade him to take passage on an Italian sloop, and, when Bashir refused, explained that it would help him, Raghib; he could telegraph Mussolini that he had arranged this, the assumption to be made in Rome being tnat Bashir had been won over. 6 He spoke of visiting Syria soon, via Bagdad, and said that he would make hp m m1^ n0 ^ n our embassy in Bagdad in case there was anything in which he might aid us whilst in Syria. His knowledge of Syrian politics and politicians is good, and he seems genuinely anxious to help us n opinion of Jamil Mardam is rather low, but he believes that Showkhri Qawatli, one of his greatest friends, can be made good use of by us if we wish There is no point m my going into other details here, as he will give them in Bagdad, and some of them may not be news. I found him quite sympathetic and recommend that he be given a hearing and encouragement. He is offering his «™s to ns and would be very hurt if they were not liven a cordial welcome 3 p,, a ( | ?kalid, 111 s P lte of the latter's pessimism, were hospitable Kushdi, the wizened little private secretary, was full of courteous attenHmi bringing us the daily news bulletins taken down from the radio and the E arrived copies of The Times, those of June! Abdurahman al Tabaishi, the Chamberlain, was as elegant and polite as ever and usually led us about the palace by the hand : an Arab custom.7 A week-end at the palace of the Wahhabi monarch, in spite of the restrictions in the way of smoking and drinking, is full of unusual charm, and my assistant, Mr. Uniacke, whose first visit it was, was quite astounded at its Arabian Nights atmosphere and the difference in manners from the more northerly Arab countries. I have, &amp;c. GEEALD de GAURY. Enclosure 5. Colonel de Gaury to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. Sir, Jedda, 'November 20, 1941. IBN SAUD has in the past stated that, if His Majesty's Government wished it, he would declare war on Germany and Italy, but Saudi Arabia has been so far of little military interest, while, on the other hand, we have had the immensely valuable spiritual and political support of Ibn Saud, as the Protector of Mecca and an independent Arab ruler. 2. If, however, it is thought possible that the German armies could advance further southwards next year, and as Ibn Sand's regime is about to crash financially, unless supported by His Majesty's Government, a matter which His Majesty's Legation has been taking up with His Majesty's Government, our military interests in Saudi Arabia may well be reviewed. These appear to be the use of— {a) Palestine-Koweit tracks, (&amp;) Landing grounds in North Arabia, (c) C.A.S.O.C. oil and refinery, (d) The great sand belts which could give invaluable respite and act as a vast mole, and the advantage of— (e) Room to manoeuvre east of Akaha and Transjordan, (/) Removal of Italian Legation from Saudi Arabia, (^) Freedom from internment of our own men forced into or down in Saudi Arabian territory, (A) Control of the movements of foreigners. 3. The disadvantages seem to be that, on the other hand, if Ibn Saud declared war on the Axis, we lose the advantage of Ibn Sand's ' disinterested ' advice to Arab politicians, although, if the Germans come any nearer, that would, in any case, lose its weight. Moreover, we should undoubtedly be asked to furnish anti-aircraft guns for the defence of the Saudi oilfields. (The Germans would be unlikely to bomb Mecca or Medina, for political reasons, and Riyadh is difficult for them to find.) 4. Incidentally, if the Indian army were charged with the Saudi area, they will wish to send political officers into it, but I can visualise serious political complications unless it were contingent that the political officers were found by and be responsible to the head of our diplomatic mission, as in Iraq. 5. It is clear that, if the Germans do come much nearer to Arabia, Ibn Saud will be unable, at that late stage, to declare war, and I therefore am inclined to the view that, if the military authorities will suddenly wish him to declare war later, it would be best for the matter to be taken up now and for the declara tion not to be delayed. I have, &amp;c. G. de GAURY.CONFIDENTIAL.

In view of your telegram o. 130 the Reserve Bank of India has 'been asked to get into 3. Supply of foodstuffs referred to in your telegram- telegram. 4. e agree it would be best if Saudi Arabia became member territory of (group omitted - Nidele East ^ ?) Supply Centre. This mil involve your communicating estimates of all your requirements to the ''iddle East Supply Centre for forwarding to London, In the first place you should send a list of requirements for the period July to December 1942. Middle East Supply Centre will advise^you regarding the details of information required by them, procedure and sources of supply. 5. U.K.C.C. are filing to handle all supplies of bul&amp; commodities approved by Middle East Supply Centre as essential if it is desited that they hall do so. Certain of these such as cereals sugar and tea at any rate if imported via the Red Sea ports will in any case probably have to be purchased centrally through the U.K.C.C., Saudi Arabian needs being allocated by the Middle East Supply Centre from Piddle East (Group omitted)s. But if this suggestion is adopted this would presumably cut out Bahrain and Kuwait merchants in regard to bulk commodities and possibly arouse serious political repercussions in Bahrain and Kuwait foreshadowed by the Political Resident in his telegram No. T/90 to Secretary of State for India. In principle it is accepted that the activities of the U.K.C.C. should not interfere more han is necessary with the normal trade channels. The question therefore arised whether any exceptional arrangements could or should be made for main taining normal Sa^di Arabian imports through Bahrain and Kuwait^in the hands of private merchants. If this were ^in Political Residenttelegram T/90 might be for tehfe Saudi importers of goods from Bahrain and Kuwait to be allowed to clear their goods through Saudi Arabia Customs only if they surrender t&gt; Saudi Arabian Government value of the goods in Rials - in exchange for their sterling value. Saudi Arabian Government would obtain the necessary sterling from our subsidy. Please telegraph your views on these, points. 6. Crux of Rugman ! s plan is whether the Saudi Arabian Government will carry into practical effect their agreement to obtain local currency by selling imported supplies. Plan would /-would break down if Ibn Sa^d ere to give away these supplies of if the Sa^di .Arabian authorities felt.themselves obliged to hand them out to consumers who were u able to produce full purchase price in Rials. There may be some method of safe guarding the position in this respect. Could you for example recommend that Ibn Saud should be asked to instruct Gellatly Hankey to take delivery and sell to distributing local merchants for cash which they would hand over to Finance Min ister , against his receipt for an equivalent amount out of subsidy ? In any case the U.K.C.C# are considering appointing G.H. as their Resident Commercial Agent at Jeddah. 7. Treasury appreciate that if these arrangements work it will be difficult to bring them to an end until oil royalties and resumption of pilgrimage bring increased revenue. VTr hile under no illusions about this, they wish to defer as long as possible the time when Ibn Saud takes for granted assistance on this scale and asks for more in addition. You may therefore when explaining our intentions to Saudi Arabian authorities, use the formula in paragraph No. 2 of Rugman^s report viz until necessary ne*'. arrangements regarding supply have been fully tested and general results ascertained; but it is for the better not to refer to the figure of 250,000 pounds sterling a month since our assistance in the immediate future will exceed that amou t; best course may thus be to speak of making up (but still pending effective working of new arrange ments) assistance in 1942 to 5 million jpimds in all, including of course sovereigns and supplies as well as sterling provided for other than pruposes mentioned in paragraph No. 6 of the report. 8. Building up of reserve of 350,000 Egyptian pounds recom mended in paragraph : T o.-6 of the report seems clearly less urgent and Treasury are disposed to agree to this only if it can be done within the total limit of 5 million pounds for 1942. 9. M alternative of 5 million pounds in 1942 will not cover the real needs, might be to treat provision of sovereigns as a Short term loan additional to the 3 million pounds and repay able authmatically out of currency other than Rials received by Gellatly Hankey for supplies. I should be glad of your views on this alternative, but you should not mention it to the Saudi Arabian Government without further reference to me. In return for gold and silver so received we might consider further minting and supply of Rials at leisure if the listing circulation is inadequate. &lt; 10. Government of India will no doujytfcomment on proposal in the last sentence of your telegram No. 130 but meanshile you should not (repeat not) assume that they will agree. Are Treasury right in assuming that request for dollar loan from the Company is not being pressed and will not be pursued if the arrangements now under discussion are adopted (refer to last sentence of your paragraph No.6)? For your own information any dollars provided by the Oil Company mil probably be obtained from us as the company can claim its dollar expenses from our exchange tariff. 11. Whether alternative ©lution in paragraph No 9 is or is not adopted, we attach importance to prevention as far as possi ble of smuggling of gold (or for that matter rupees) out of Saudi Arabia.SECRET Telegram Z No. 7520 dated 24th April 1:42.

We accept your estimate of £3.000.000 for financial assistance to Ibn Saud during 1942. We do not, however, wish you to inform Saudi Arabian G-overnment that we are prepared to go as high as this, since they might be encouraged to ask, on one ground or another, for the whole sum early in the vear and then to make further demands later on.

Political Agent, Kuwait'1'V 7^ VISIT TO RIYADH iViAY 24t3a, 1942. ^ I left Kuwait at 5 a.m. on May tlie 28th in my Stat ion Waggon accompanied by a new ,f Dodge Jf lorry with the overflow in the way of servants and kit. My two Aden ser vants Nasar and his brother Mohammad were with me in my car as also was Nassar bin Gawan of the Ajman tribe, a guide of remown and one leg the other having been amputated as a result of a gun shot wound received in the Ikhwan troubles. In the lorry were the driver and his assistant^ and Adas bin Saleh of the Rashaida a retainer of the Shaikh of Kuwait who joined the party as it was but fitting that I as Political Agent, Kuwait, should on such an im portant expedition be accompanied by one of His Highness* personal retainers, incidentally his inclusion was not without value to both His Highness and myself for His High ness thereby became associated with my visit to Ibn Saud whom he fears and reveers, and I should have found him very useful in any dealings that might have been necessary with the less civilised tribesmen in the event of a breakdown of our transport for they all know of both Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Kuwait but not all by any means know any thing of the might of the British government. The journey as far as Jariyah al Iliyah was unevent ful and hot but on arrival at the square fort of the Amir which houses the Saudi Government wireless station I found we were expected, and the Amir came down from his room over the gate to meet me and the guard presented arms as I drove my car into the fort. I was led up to the room over the gate and coffee and tea were duly produced and water brought, by his express command, for my consumption from his private well a little distance from the town. It was a pleasant fluid fairly cool and milky in colour due to solids of some description in suspension which luckily did not effect the flavour. I decided to wait some time at Jariya and go on when it was a little cooler so I was glad to accept the Amir ♦ s/Ami v * .g hospitality at lunctL which very soon made its appearance and consisted of a well cooked and succulently stuffed sheep resting on a bed of very hot rice and many plates of curry and sweetmeats. The Amir did not join us as he aparantly suffered from some internal complaint the nature of which 1 did not enquire as I have found that such enquiries are often answered with distressing and em barrassing franiaiess. My servants, the lorry driver and his assistant with Nassar and Adas sat round and we did ourselves very well indeed. More coffee was forthcoming after lunch and then tea in little glasses with sugar and no milk and as hot as could be. At 3 p.m. we were away, after touching farewells and much wishing for a safe journey and safer return, along a stony track running through broken country and of a bare ness that is impossible to dei^cribe. After seventy miles I had had enough and decided to halt for the night near a herd of camels which were eating remarkably dry looking bushes with expressions of grave contempt. No sooner were we halted than Adas announced that he rather thought we had come the wrong way and had thought so for some time, this was no doing o| Nassar for Adas was himself acting as guide after lunch, I was furious but as usual my fury was a waste of energy. There was nothing for it but to drive back the way we had come until we found the lorrjt which was I following us some distance behind, the driver being the fictucd)y part owner and particularly careful in consequence. A the lorry was not far behind and all was welljand we returned to the camp site selected and I was soon listening to the B.B.C. broadcast and eating cold chicken while the rest of the party consumed whatever their fancy had induced them to bring for their own sustenance. I was in bed by 8.30 p.m. and/0 and tlie servants took the rifles and lay down in a circle round the cars and we were soon all fast asleep. We were up at S a.m. having slept well except for the interruption caused by a fox with a very fine tail who called in to collect some chicken bones he had smelt in passing on his lawful occasions at about 11.30 p.m. and d disturbed the servants who thought in the moonlight that it was a wolf. In half an hour we were £$ray along the rough track through the same unpreposing country luckily hidden from view by the shades of night. I half slept as we fol- driver . lowed our lorry A who knew the way, for my driver was driv ing as I wished to reserve what small amount of energy I possessed for the Dhahna Sands which were to be crossed before we reached Ramah. We reached Ma'agla at 4.30 a.m. and little did I see of it for it was only half light and we remained but long enough to fill up with water before starting out for the Dhahna Sands which I imagined, in my ignorance, to be close to the village. In fact there are only three ridges of sand worth noting and the first of these, the Sirru, is some thirty five miles from Ma 1 agla over an unpleasantly stony road, fhe Sands are light red in colour and of fine texture but I experienced no difficulty in navigating the Sirru ridge and the lorry also came through without mishap. The Sirru ridge is about half a mile in width and is probably the most difficult of the three to cross owing to the height of the ridge which though not great is sufficient to cause an inexperienced driver to lose momentum# The next ridge is the Ruachib and is seven miles from the Sirru, rather wider but less unpleasant to deal with. Then follows a stretch of some seventeen miles of indifferent going to the Hamami which is of much the same width as the Ruachib but is tricky as it has a right angle bend in the middle. We lost sight of the lorry just before the Hamami but passed/(W passed on 'to Ra.Di f a.li fourtieeii milGs 'to 'fcli© soirtliwestj, a. collection of wells with a wireless station and a few E.P, tents scarcely warranting tlie largish print used on most maps to marie the place. The Amir, an uncouth person, gave us coffee and sent a message to Riyadh ahout our probable time of arrival and the route we would take. I used one of the gentlemen's tents to change from my Khaki Omani nightgown like shirt into white cotton trousers and a white nightgown like garment and to shave and generally improve my appearance for I had been warned before leaving Kuwait that I should probably be met by officials of some sort as we neared Riyadh. We waited tfce best part of an hour for the lorry which failed to materialise so on the Amir assuring us that he would send out if it did not appear in reasonable time and knowing that they had ample cdpne- water and provisions we set out^for Riyadh along the Bewaib road. More desolate country and rough stony roads uninteresting in the extreme until the Be waib pass is reached where the road has been taken through a cutting with a one in one gradient. Some fifteen miles from Riyadh we came up to a stationary car with large baloon tyres which disgorged two Arab gentlemen, Reshdi Mulhes the chief assistant to Yusuf Yasin, and the other, Mohamad bin Ataishan the chief of the Riyadh Police, and Hassan a Somali driver I had known in Aden. The two gentlemen were very courteous and after the usual compliments had been paid we three climbed into their car and followed by my Station Waggon thus completed the journey to Riyadh. The town is situated in a plain and is really of considerable size but this is not apparent at first sight owing to the numerous date plantations which hide the buildings. The old palace dominates the town and the large residences of the members of the Family and notables out side/side the walls are impressive but tiie centrV-jriece, althou- h gh it is not in the centre, is the Maraba A Palace which lies to the right of the town as one approaches from Ramah and is the residence of the King. The MarabalPalace is a col lection of large buildings with curious castellations sur rounded by a high wall with large square towers and an impressive entrance gate^ the whcble building being done in feddish tinged mud which looks like stone from a distance and I am told wears as well. It is of large size and must contain several hundred rooms and does contain two electric lifts. We passed round the palace through thousands of black bedouin tents for the tribes are receiving their annual gifts and the Amir Saud considered there were not less than nine thousand Bedouin present each day that I was there to aay nothing of the twenty thousand poor per sons who are said to live on the King's bounty. More stony ground and bad roads and we came to the Wadi Hanifa in which are situated pleasant date gardens and the Biddia Summer Palace where the King spends the middle of the day in summer and in whose grounds is situated the guest house in which I was to lodge. We arrived at the door of the guest house and all got out and passing a saluting guard climbed up to the first floor where I found I was in un disputed possession of two bed rooms, a dining room, a sit ting room with four sofas and fifteen 'easy' chairs, and a bath room with a shower and two water closets, one of the eastern pattern and one of the more usual western pattern this latter had the top of the cistern conveniently left 0&gt;j- &amp;&amp;t so that the flushing levbr could be raised by hand and a wooden seat which less conveniently was also detached. We were scarcely seated in the sitting room before a servant appeared and placed some empty saucers on the little tables. I enquired what they were for and w&amp;s told for the convenience of visitors. My first surprise, but I was soon to realise that there was just as much smoking in certain/certain circles at Riyadh as in Kuwait, in fact Shaildi AMullali bin Suliman the Finance Minister has a distinct smokers cough and a likimg for 'Lucky Strike' which he smokes in large quantities, coffee was followed by tea and then my two companions lunched with me at 3 p.m. and immed- iatelt after, took their leave for which I was profoundly grateful as I was very tired and my eyes were red and fill ed with dust from the drive. I went to my room and slept soundly only to be wakened at 5 p.m. with the announcement by Reshdi Mulhes, who had timidly materialised in my bed room, that Ibn Saud would see me in half an hour. I had a remarkably cold shower and hastily donning my best, black socks, evening shoes, white cotton trousers, white night shirt and linen coat buttoned to the neck the whole sur mounted by a light 'Bisht' with a white muslin head cloth and black agal, rushed out to find Reshdi Mulhes patiently waiting. We drove to the 'Marabah' and swinging in through t the gate along a stone paved road came to a halt in the courtyard which was filled with motor vehicles and persons hurrying to and fro. The guard presented arms and I was introduced to the police officer on duty, a Turk, and pro ceeded by Reshdi Mulhes climbed up stairs and walked along corridors and through reception rooms until the hall of audience was reached for such I suppose it should be called A large room which seemed of considerable length and to be decorated exclusively with enormous chased mirrors hanging from the wall like family portraits between the many open windows. On the left hand side I saw the members of the household and the Amir Faisal and at the far end in lordly and splendid majesty Ibn Saud seated in a corner next to a telephone, I noticed later that he had a strange prefer ence for corners. He and the rest of the gathering rose as I advanced and we shook hands and paid the usual compli ments/1 merits, at Ills direction I seated myself on Kis right and we talked of the weather, Jahra water melons, the tribes. Shaikh Ahmad's health and Mr. Stonhewer Bird's expected arrival at Jedda on the morrow by air from Cairo. Coffee i appeared in luinutie oups and 'then a sweet drink in glasses, an enormous glass for Ibn Saud and small ones for 'tiie resj? of us. He told me lie disliked sweet things and drank only a conventional sip. After some ten minutes I bowed myself out and again escorted by Reshdi Mulhes made my way down stairs and out to the car which had disappeared. Frantic searching elicited the fact that it had a puncture so I drove myself away ih my Station Waggon which my driver had brought along behind our saloon when we came up from the Wadi Hanifa. As I drove through the palace gates I heaved a sigh of relief and snapped the cord of my white trousers, thank God it had not occured in the Royal presence ten minutes before. After getting involved in a private court yard and nearly running over a Saluki I drove back to the Biddiah house and cast off my finery with unspeakable rel ief. Later Reshdi Mulhes called and asked my programme and said that His Majesty would like to know if I had any special communication to make for if so he would accord me an audience in the morning at the old palace. I explained that my visit was not in any way official and that I had no particular reasons for coming to Riyadh other than the ones I had already given which were to have the honour of making the acquaintance of a great man and to see the cap ital city of Nejd but that naturally I was entirely at Ibn 3aud f s service and if he desired my presence then God willing I would be there. No more was said that evening and in a very ^hort time Reshdi departed leaving me to relax and dine alone. Early to bed and immediately asleep. quite early the next morning May 25th Reshdi Mulhes appeared and again cross-examined me regarding a private i interview with Ibn Saud and my reply was the same as it had//W ) ^ o. had been the the evening before so he went off to the 'Marabah' stating that he would seek instructions and telephone to the head servant in charge of the house which he did within the hour to announce that a car would call for me at 8.45 a.m. and would convey me to the old Palace in the town where he would be awaiting me and that I was to call upon the Amir Saud first and would then be received in private audience by Ibn Saud, Everything worked according to plan and at about twenty minutes to nine I entered the city through a small gate in the wall and drove along a widish street flanked by tall houses along which numbers of Bedouin were hurrying to and from the palace and the market. Up a slight rise we came to the entrance to the palace and the Suk at what was apparently the termination of the road along which we had travelled. More guards and Reshdi Mulhes waiting and then along corridors up some worn steps which were very diffi cult to negotiate in skirts and along a passage filled with servants^ &amp;&amp;&amp; across anH anti room with waiting visitors and into a small reception room filled with heavily uphol stered furniture ranged round the wall and the Amir Saud who looked equally over upholstered possibly due to a high collar to his white muslin garments and a cold in his nose on which he wore a pair of rimless glasses of the pince-nez variety. Tall but without his fathers fine feat ures he seemed heavy and dull and reminded me of a play called 'Outward Bound' which was about a ^acht load of people voyaging between heaven and hel]., or the earth I forget which, but which ever it was they had cast away their old moorings and were drifting aimlessly about much as the Amir Saud who has cast raff many of his ties with his Bedouin ancestors but has not yet succeeded in coming to rest among the so called civilistd of this world. We talked of London and the relative merits of the Hyde Park Hotel and the Dorchester and both agreed that we preferred the/, ?3 9 the more modern Dorciiester and ti en somewhat surprisingly came home and talked of the Bedouin camped outside the town walls and how b usy he was listen■ng to their compla ints and seeing that they received their annual bounty from his father, no more and no less than was their right. Some tribesmen from the Hadramut were supposed to have arrived and we discussed the length of time it took for them to reach Riyadh and then rather inconsequently turned to the cold he had in his nose and the difficulty of know ing what to do about fans in the hot weather and how dan gerous they were in the matter og chills. Reshdi Mulhes remained with us the whole time but seemed to have some t^elepathetic contact with other parts of the vast building for he suddenly said that His Majesty was ready to receive me so I got to my feet and said farewell to the Amir Saud and gathered up my garments and followed Reshdi Mulhes out of a door which communicated by means of a right angle passage with the long oblong room in which His Majesty was holding court and listening to the interminable greviances of the Bedouin. Slaves and servitors rose as we approached and others standing in the door of the hall of audience drew back and let us enter to find Ibn Saud esconsed in a far corner with a window on either side of him and a tele phone within easy reach. Reshdi withdrew and Ibn Saud rose as I approached and after shaking hands motioned me to a seat on his right. I started the conversation by thanking him for the privilege of an interview which he had accorded me and made it clear that I had no ulterior motive in pay ing him a visit and was not charged with some secret and profound message for him but rather was a sight seer, a tourist, satisfying a very natural and very laudable cur iosity. He gave forth several polite phrases about Kuwait and Shaikh Ahmad and enquired about his physical condition and then proceeded to lecture me on world affairs. His face grew animated and I had the best possible view cbf him as every/every now and again he turned to tlie window on Ms left and I saw tlie line of tlie nose and the jutting beard. I kept my eyes fixed on his and every time I showed a tendency to allow my gaze to wander I was called to attention by an al- mos'^peremptory 'Listen', and listen I did while he dwelt on the Palestine question and how he had pointed out to the more extreme elements in his country that overt action again st the Jews would bring them into immediate contact with Great Britian to their eventual undoing, he passed on to the Iraqi question and held forth on ho?/ their army had become impregnated with politics, the very worst possible thing to happen to any army, and went on to discourse on his relations with Rashid Ali and the attitude he had adopted some years ago when the Iraqis looked as if they might take direct act ion against Kuwait. He talked of the present world war and t the G-ermans and the Italians but did not mention India or Japan. He repeated what I had already heard Mr. Stonehewer Bird, H.B.M f s Minister in Jedda state he had heard him say that the Arabs must back the allied cause as their existence depended on an allied victory. This was no question of likes and dislikes aed and he was, so he said, continually making it clear to all who sought his advice that the Arabs must aid the allied cause in every possible way. Mention was made of Sir Percy Cox and the northern frontier and his relations with Kuwait and Bahrain and he asked why I had not visited him when he was in camp with Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah and Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabir as Subah at G-esuma in December last year when he had accorded me permission to enter his territory. I explained that it was due to the fact that I had no desire that a purely soc ial gathering should be misinterepted as a political meeting as a result of the arrival of a British Official at their Gamp. He said he understood and had suspected that that was the reason. He drey/ my attention to the excellent relations which now existed between his country and Kuwait and then lectured/cJc rie lectured me on how to deal witli Arabs. Jorce and diplomacy A were necessary lie maintained, by tiieir skilful use you could do what you liked with the Arab, it seemed that force was to be preferred and diplomacy was only to be called in when adequate force to achieve the object was lacking. The conversation was entirely one sided and lasted the best part of three quarters of an hour. At last the end came and he stopped speaking and seemed to be rather exhausted by his effort for he complained of the heat and then we talked of the tribesmen camped outside his gates and how they came from far and near and- how they lived as his guests for three days and each party came to receive his customary gift of from one thousand to fifteen thousand rials and a quota of rice etc. Much as I would have liked to remain I felt that the time had come to ask permission to leave and it was granted with a pleasant smile and then I noticed his eyes one very bright and keen and the other clouded with what looked like a cataract. He asked what I proposed to do and suggested I went to A1 Karaj to see the agricultural de velopments there and Reshdi Mulhes was summoned and directed to see that I went immediately after lunch and that as he, Reshdi, was busy with the post Yusuf Yasin's nephew Tahir Effendi Redhwan should accompany me. I would spend the night there His Majesty informed me and would return the follow ing afternoon in time to dine with him that evening. I nat urally acquised in these arrangements and shaking hands left Ibn Saud to his tribal work and went back to the Wadi Hanifa and was there joined by Tahir Sffendi who had lunch with me before we set out for A1 Karaj. In accordance with Ibn Saud 1 s orders we left in mid afternoon and crossing a particularly uninviting, hot, and dreary fifty miles of country came after some two hours travel to fields of Alfalfa, green and kind to the eyes. Just before we reached the green fields we were met by the nephew/?b -12- nephew of Shaikh Abdullah bin Suliman, the Minister of Fin ance, Driving through the fields we oame to a small village with a large and pleasant house obviously of recent construc tion on the right with a smaller one slightly in the rear of it and learnt without surprise that the large house was the property of His Majesty and that it was nearing complet ion and that the smaller one would be used by the Amir Saud and lesser luminaries. We passed a threshing machine at work with clouds of fine dust hanging in the still air and turned left to the Minister r s house, a pleasant place of white arches and courts. The Minister was awaiting us, a Nejdi of small and spare build with thin features, slightly prominent eyes, and of dark complexion he was dressed completly in thin white cotton with a white cotton or muslin shawl on his head, an incredibly hard worker as I was to discover later with an appetite out of all propotion to his size. He had lived for ten years in Bombay doing business I gathered but I have since heard it stated that he was employed in a humble cap acity in his youth by a Nejdi business house and I also heard it stated while I was in his house that he has a fin ger in every'Saudi Arabian pie including the army. To a very superficial observer he seems to be a live wire with whom it would be as well to be on good terms. We sat and drank coffee and tea in little glasses with sugar and smoked cigarettes until it was cooler and then we drove out to see the estate which has been in existence three years and is the result of the drive and innitiative of Shaikh Abdullah. We watched them winnowing corn by hand and then went to the motor thresher and examined the grain and from there to the donkey's quarters, fine white animals from Hasa, one of which had a sore back which at once att racted Shaikh Abdullah's notice and he gave instructions for it to be dressed, then to the working bullocks and I listen ed to/-13- to a disoourse on how the larger animals from the Tiliamali iiad been tried but iiad proved a failure owing to their being accustomed to a sandy soil and the hard roci: surface of the country round A1 Karaj had injured their feet. We drove into the fields and saw Zinnias flowering, roses, orange trees, pomergranets, grape vines, melons and many varieties of green vegetables such as cucumbers and radishes. Then over to the wells which produce the water for this enterprise which Shail^J jfetd i *^3 Abdullah said was now paying in spite of^500 horses and many other animals. There are many wells but three of note and these are really small lakes sunk some fifteen to twenty feet below the surface of the surrounding rock about thirty yards in length and of varying width. The water in the first one I came to y /as 420 feet deep and was being pumped out through what looked like an eight inch pipe by a Blackstone oil engine, I was told the rate of flow which was very impressive but which I have forgotten. I was much impressed by Shaikh Abdullah^ knowledge of the work and the effeciency with which everything was being done and the cleanliness of all the machinery. We passed on to look at the canal which is being constructed by two American engineers to run 20 Kilor meters to irrigate new areas of wheat land and I had the pleasure of meeting the younger of the Americans at his small house near the starting point of the canal. The elder was aparently on a few days leave at Dhahran the C.A.S.O.C's headquarters. He gave us clean cold water with ice, very wel come, and explained how the canal was being dug with some sort of automatic machine and would be faced with local stone and local lime both available on the spot. As evening fell we came home and I went off to change and bathe in a somewhat primitive manner from a corrugated iron tank with the aid of a small pint measure. The water was remarkably cold and refreshing and I returned comfortably clad in a white cotton 'dishdasher' to the central court to find carpets had been spread and my host was reclining in the centre/C&gt;\ , QX .if* '14:— 'y m *ipik l jfati** #=|, rvv^. ■''- : h Ct'^| ^ | jf \ centre of ti^em looking remarkably oool and collected. I / ^ ^ joined him, leaving my sandals at the edge of the carpets and we talked of a number of things including India on which subject my host waxed indignant and eloquent over the Con gress question. Congress* attitude was inexplicable to him and our lack of drastic action iri^egard to them even more so and I was treated to a lecture on firmness and how essential it was when dealing with orientals especially in war time. As he talked the shadows of night drew in and presently presure lamps were brought and placed behind pillars so that their light should not dazzle our eyes. They cast shadows and illuminated the white arches of the building and the moon came out and all was peaceful and cooler than it had been through the hot and dusty day. Suddenly my host broke off from advocating the use of the Indian States to stamp out the Congress and suggested dinner. I agreed and he had but to raise a hand to bring running a servant lad armed with a mauser pistol who had been squatting with a companion sim ilarly armed at the far end of the courtyard. The lad listen ed to his master's orders and ran off to have them executed which they were in a remarkably short space of time and he returned to announce that dinner awaited our pleasure. We walked down the courtyard and into a small room on the darpeted floor of which was spread an ample and rich meal. We sat round the white cloth some twelve of us includ ing my two servants, and servitors stood behind ss and waved fans while others held glasses of water ready to hand to any of the diners who should feel thirsty. I ate sparingly for it was warm and my digestion is not of the strongest but I confess I enjoyed the water melons and rock melons. ¥/e ret urned to the courtyard after dinner and drank coffee and I had an opportunity of talking to Hussein A1 Uweini the Packard Agent and Ibn Saud's Agent in Beirut who had been introduced to me at dinner but with whom I had not so far had much conversation. He talked of the difficulties of war time/9c ( -is. y time trade and the lack of a decent hotel in Kuwait. Later our host suggested a visit to the Americans and we drove over to their house where v/e found Mr. Twitchell who is I believe the manager of the gold mining company and Mr. Hamil ton and another gentleman whose name I never heard clearly pronounced; these two latter persons being the members of the Agricultural Mission. They seemed to be very open in their accounts of their doings except when Twitchell stepped in and stopped them. They were concerned about the drainage of the area and said they were pleased to say that they had arrived in time for action to be taken. They also predicted an extensive development of the area and said they were going on to Hofuf to examine the possibility of development there in the rice line among other things. Nice people and very cheery, complaining of the sand flies, I said they gave one fever and trusted they would not get an infection, I hope they did'nt but I was bitten very badly during the night and am suffering from the aftermath of Sandfly Jever as I write this. The following day I drove round with Shaikh Abdullah, Tahir Effendi and Hussein Al Uweini to see the other parts of the estate and returned to the house to listen for hours to Hussein Al Uweini on the iniquitousness of the French in Syria while my host went off and slept, Why, I was asked, did we not take over Syria for the duration of the war and for twenty years afterwards, why did we leave the Syrians to the mercy of the Free French who were no differ ent from the Vichy French and who took just as many bribes. Syria's position was hopeless with the Jews to the south and the Turks to the north and the French in possession, verily they were like sheep led to the slaughter house. I ventured to suggest that perhaps the Syrian^ had no desire to be ruled by Great Britian even for the duration of the war whereupon Hussein became most excited and said that it was exactly what the Syrians did want and called on Tahir b Effendi/V U) Effendi for his opinion which was exactly the same. I wonder. I tired of these two after three and a half hours and went to my room but it was remarkably hot and the floor seem ed very uninviting, the room had not even an^easy' chair^ so I was forced to return to the Syrians and try and guide their conversation into less trying channels. I was partially suc cessful but was profoundly glad when mine host came in look ing refreshed after his sleep and suggested lunch. Lunch was on much the same scale as the dinner the night before and our host did himself very' well indeed which was particularly surprising as the temperature was certainly not less than 115 F. After lunch we rested for an hour or so and then bidding farewell to our host drove the fifty odd miles back to Riyadh in a dust storm. We got back about 5 p.m and I had rather more than an hour before I was required to be present at the^Marabah' I'alaoo for dinner. I bathed and changed into my Sunday best and did my utmost with a light coloured gold embroidered ,t Bhist ,f or Gloak and a white muslin head cloth tastefully decorated with white 'forget-me-nots' to uphold the prestige of the G-overnment of India. I was no sooner ready than I found Reshdi Mulhes and Tahir Sffendi waiting so off I went in their company to the entrance to the ft Marabah ,, Palace, now the courtyard was des erted except for the Guard of Honour, along empty passages to-a small office where we sat and waited as we were seem ingly rather early and then out into a corridor at the end of which I could see the princes of the blood disappearing up a narrow staircase, we hurried after them and found our selves on a flat roof with two rows of divans flanking car pets at the end of which stood an enormous chair with great stuffed cushions and a telephone, on either side of which were two low sofas. The members of the household sat on the divans on the right and the Amir Abdullah bin Abdur Rahman His Majesty's brother, and the Amirs Saud and Faisal on the left. I was introduced to the Amir Abdullah by the Amir Saud o and/1 '' and parked myself on the sofa on tiie left of the 'throne'. I talked to the Amirs in arable and as they were some fifty feet away from me and everyone else sat like mutes it was not particularly enjoyable but all went well and there were no embarassing pauses. Some twenty minutes were passed in this manner while the row of slaves behind the princes looked steadily to their front then a commotion to my rear drew my attention to a number of people entering the stage from a small doorway immediately behind me and I was surprised to see Ibn Saud appear suddenly from what seemed to me to be quite the most inappropriate direction for we all sat facing the entrance to the lift up which I believe all of us thought he would come. We all rose and His Majesty came for ward and I advanced to greet him and shook hands. He sat down on the padded chair and we. resumed our seats, not for very long however for we had scarcely said two or three words on the subject of A1 Karaj before dinner was announced and Ibh Saud asking me if I was ready led the way from one roof to another past blind men reciting the Koran and pro ceeded by a lad walking backwards with a censer of burning sandle wood presumably lest any foul odours should assail one's nostrils. At length after passing several narrow doorways we found ourselves on a spacious roof spread with carpets and with he dinner laid out on a long white table cloth in the centre. It was a noble meal with three sheep roasted whole and dozens of side dishes and sweetmeats and fruits. Ibn Saud sat at one end with myself on his right and Dr. Midhaf Shaikh al Ard next to me and then the other members of the household while the Amirs sat on Ibn Baud's left. Slaves stood round and one in particular busied himself with look ing after me though I was easily capable of doing so myself. I noticed that we all sat in shoes except Ibn Saud and that every one pecked at the food with forks and spoons except Ibn Saud and myself and we used our hands. Servants stood behind/-18- / behind holding glasses of water in pretty glasses with gilt edges and one turned and drank when one felt inclined. Ibn Saud ate more than any of us and when he had finished turned to the servant behind him and siezed an enormous green enamel mug with red flowers that must have held a couple of pints and emptied it, no silly fancy gilt rimmed glasses for him and I absolutely agreed with him. We rose and washed our hands and retraced our steps to where we had sat before dinner and after a few minutes coffe« arrived and the insence burner immediateiy after it so I made my excuses and after arranging for a farewell interview at 3 0 T Clock Arabic the next morning bid farewell and left escorted by Reshdi Mulhes. I spent a restless night among the sand flies on the roof, my slumbers were not eased by a particularly noisy goat that I discovered shared the roof with me and kept peering into my face in an enquiring manner. I made my preparations to leave immediately after lunch and everything ted boon seen to except tipping the servants in the Biddiah house which was a somewhat lengthy proceeding as there were so many when it came to tipping that one wondered how it was that at least a dozen of them could^t have failed to hear some of those hearty cries for a servant which I had given vent to from time to time only to be answered by the unbroken silence of the house. I drove alone to the city for my last audience and talked to the Amir Saud for some time before Ibn Saud was ready to receive me. Our conversation ranged from the Duke of Hamilton*s Scots seat to the Pilgrimage what time we drank 0^ tea in the usual little glasses followed by cold sweet drinks. His Royal Highness* cold was much better and he did not look quite so much like a stuffed owl as he had on the previous occasions. I wish I had met him when his nasal organs were really clear for it is quite impossible to/p -19- to judge a person when they are suffering froitrii bad cold in the head. Reshdi who had been sitting quietly in a corner suddenly announced that Ibn Saud was waiting so His Royal Highness and I said farewell in very warm terms and I fol lowed Reshdi along the usual route to Ibn Sauds reception room through the usual crowd of supplicants, servants, sol diers, slaves, and officials and found him in the usual corner looking as if he had not moved since last I had seen . himjfchere forty eight hours before. My two servants and Shaikh Ahmad*s man, Adas ; came in and kissed his hand and a clerk appeared with a freshly written letter. Ibn Saud sat down and so did I and I waited for the clerical gentleman to come forward and have the letter signed but he showed no inclination to do so and as Ibn Saud continued to look at me I presumed that he was waiting for me to say my say and get me gone so I asked permission to leave which merely brought a surprised look to his face so I tried again and the look of surprise increased and for one dreadful moment I felt I must have dropped some incredible brick and used an ill chosen word but I had but used a formula that I had used ten thousands of times during the last eleven years and the third time was lucky for on a further repetition the great man's thoughts came to earth and the usual reply was made and then we chatted for a few minutes and I thanked him for his kind gift to myself and my servants which Abdur Rahman Tobashi had brought to the Biddiah house just before I left for this interview and which included besides the usual ^bhists' and shawls a gold watch and a gold dagger for myself and a money gift for each of the servants. He replied by say ing that it was just something to remember him by and I made what I trust was a suitable answer and we rose and he gave me messages for Shaikh Ahmad and Dickson and with a mutual farewell wish for each others peace we parted and I withdrew from the room and the palace, and presumably the waiting clerk got/r ' l -20- got his letter signed. I distributed largesse to the servants and completed my packing just finishing before ttie Americans walked in, they were it- seems on their way to Dhahran and had just come in from A1 Karaj. We lunched together and I confess Twitchell seemed very suspicious of me and made no suggestion that we should travel in company when I said I was also contemplating going to Dhahran via Hinnat, the Hofuf road being impossible• I left them to their own desires after lunch and drove to within a mile of Ramah and there halted for the night by the Wa)&lt;Lf 9 side of the road, we followed the A road which had no pass like the Bewaib road but was much the same as regards lack of interest. As it grew dark and I sat listening to the B.B, C. programme I noticed the car lights of our American friends who spent the night a mile or so from us. The night was warm so it was no effort to get up at 3.30 a.m. and start packing up for the next stage of the journey. We drove into Eamah and found a smart looking Station Waggon waiting there for us with letters from Ibn Saud for Shaikh Ahmad. They were handed over to me and I signed a receipt for them and realised the reason for the confusiorjkt my last meeting with Ibn Saud for the clerk with the letter was obviously waiting to have it signed so that I could convey it to Shaikh Ahmad from Ibn Saud and my insis tence on leaving had confused him and made him unwilling to ask me to wait while the letter was put into an envelope so he had with some reluctance agreed to my departure and sent the letter after me by special messenger. We left Ramah at 5 a*m, and negotiated the Dhalana Sands without incident arriving at Ma 1 agla at 8.15 a.m. and washed in the concrete cistern surrounding the pipe from the well. An hour went by and no sign of our lorry but the Amer icans arrived, three of them and their interepter and a driver in one Ford Saloon. They said they had seen our lorry stopped/-21- iv If stopped witli a broken spring but that the driver was not in need of assistance and then they drove over to have tea with some local inhabitant again no suggestion from Twitchell that I should join forces with them knowing as they did that the sand between Hinnat and Abu Haderiyah was worrying me. I decided not to wait for the lorry which had now proved itself to be a throughly unreliable vehicle and, as I was unwilling to approach the Americans with a request that I might join them, to push straight on to Kuwait. I drove straight through only stopping for ten minutes on one occas ion to chase a bustard ineffectuallji and for an hour at Jar- iyah while petrol was poured into the car. We arrived at Kuwait at ten minutes to seven tired but happy. \Bushir« f the and 1942. confidential* Ttoe Besldenoy* D # C»Bo#6S6«^» Please refer to your letter !lo«l4/|/54B of the 50th Bay 194a# a # You may keep the cloaks and shawl and buy the gold watoh for R6mZ00/~ which fehould be credited to Govermsent* 5.

I left Kuwait at 8 a.m. on May 23rd, 1942 and was cor dially welcomed to luncli by His Majesty King Itm Saud^ Governor at Jariyah al Uliyali on my arrival tliere at 1 p.m. I slept the night in the desert some twenty miles short of Ma'agla and crossing the Dhahna Sands without difficulty or incident arrived at Ram*ah about 8 a.m. on the 24th May where I bathed and changed into formal Arab clothes for my arrival in Riyadh. I left for Riyadh at 9.30 a.m. via the Bewaib Pass road and was met some fifteen miles from the capital by Reshdi Mulhes Assistant to Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, and Mohamad bin Ataishan the Chief of Police at Riyadh. These gentlemen accom panied me to Riyadh and conducted me past the King^ new pal ace, the 'Marabah? to the guest house in the ?/adi Hanifah where accomodation had been arranged for me. The same afternoon Reshdi Mulhes called and informed me that the King would see me at 5.30 p.m. at the 'Marabah'. I dressed in my best apparel and was conducted to the palace and up to the first floor by Reshdi Mulhes who left me at the entrance to the hall of audience. A large room which seemed of considerable length and to be decorated exclusively with enormous chased mirrors hanging from the wall like family portraits between the many open windows. On the left hand side I saw the members of the household and the Amir Feisal and at the far end in lordly and splendid majesty Ibn Saud seated in a corner next to a telephone. I noticed later that he had a strange liking for corners and telephones. He and the rest of the gathering rose as I advanced and we shook hands and paid the usual compliments, at his direction I seated myself on his right and we talked of the weather, Jahra water melons, the tribes, Sliaikli Ahmad's health and Mr. Stonehewer Bird's expect-enormous glass for Ibn Saud and small ones for the rest of us. He told me he disliked sweet things and took only a con ventional sip. After some ten minutes I bowed myself out and again escorted by Heshdi Mulhes made my way downstairs and out to the car which had disappeared. Frantic searching elic ited the fact that it had a puncture so I drove myself away in my Station ?/aggon which my driver had brought along behind our saloon when we came up from the Wadi Hanifah. Later Resh- di Mulhes called and asked my programme and said that His Majesty would like to know if I had any special communication to make for if so he would accord me an audience in the morn ing at the old palace, I explained that my visit was not in any way official and that I had no particular reason for coming to Riyadh other than the ones I had already gfcven which were to have the honour of making the acquaintance of a great man and to see the capital city of Nejd but that naturally I was entirely at Ibn Saud's service and if he des ired my presence then God willing I would be there. Quite early the next morning, May 25th, Reshdi Mulhes appeared and again cross examined me regarding a private interview with Ibn Saud and my reply was the same as it had been the evening before so he went off to the 'Marabah' stat ing that he would seek instructions and telephone to the head servant in charge of the house which he did within the hour to announce that a car ?/ould call for me and I was to call on the Amir Saud first and then v/ould be received in private audience by Ibn Saud, Everything worked according to pian and at about twenty minutes to nine I entered the city through a small gate in the wall and drove along a widish street flanked by tall houses along which numbers of Bedouin were hurrying to and from the palace and tlie market. Up a slight rise we came to the entrance to the palace and the Suk at what was apparently the/- mthe termination of the road along which we had travelled. More Guards and Reshdi Mulhes waiting and then along corrid ors up some worn steps which were very difficult to negotiate in skirts and along a passage filled with servants, across an anti-room with waiting visitors and into the small recep- t tion room of the Amir Saud. The Amir Saud who has cast off many of his ties with his Bedouin ancestors but has not yet succeeded in coming to rest among the so called civilised of this world talked of London and the relative merits of the Hyde Park Hotel and the Dorchester and we both agreed that we preferred the more mod ern Dorchester and then somewhat surprisingly came home and talked of the Bedouin camped outside the town walls and how busy he was listening to their complaints and seeing that they received their annual bounty from his father, no more and no less than was their right. Reshdi Mulhes remained with us the whole time but seemed to have some telepathetic con tact with other parts of the vast building for he suddenly that His Majesty was ready to receive me so I got to my feet and said farewell to the Amir Saud and gathered up my garments and followed Reshdi Mulhes out of a door which com municated by means of a right angle passage with the long oblong room in which His Majesty was holding court and listen ing to the interminable grievances of the Bedouin. Slaves and servitors rose as we approached and others standing in the door of the hall of audience drew hack and let us enter to find Ibn Saud esconsed in a far corner with a window on either side of him and a telephone within easy reach. Reshdi withdrew and Ibn Saud rose as I approached and after shaking hands motioned me to a seat on his right. J started the conversation by thanking him for the privilege of an interview which he had accorded me and made it clear that I had no ulterior motive in paying him a visit and was not charged/(\tfy charged witii some secret and profound message for him but was rather a sight-seer, a tourist, satisfying a very natural and very laudable curiosity. He gave forth several polite phrases about Kuwait and Shaikh Ahmad and enquired about his physical condition and then proceeded to lecture me on world affairs. His face grew animated and I had the best possible view of him as every now and again he turned to the window on his left and I saw the line of the nose and the out jutting beard. I kept my eyes fixed on his and every time I showed a tendency to allow my gaze to wander I was called to attention by an almost peremptory 'listen', and listen I did while he dwelt on the Palestine question and how he had pointed out to the more extreme elements in his country that overt action against the Jews would bring them into immediate contact with Great Britian to their eventual undoing, he passed on to the Iraqi question and held forth on how their army had become 9 impregnated with poljyfcics, the very worst possible thing to happen to any army, and went on to discourse on his relations with Rashid Ali and the attitude he had adopted some years ago when the Iraqis looked as if they might take direct action against Kuwait. He talked of the present world war and the Germans and the Italians but did not mention India or Japan. He repeated what I had already heard Mr. Stonehewer Bird, H.B.M's Minister in Jedda state he had heard him say that the Arabs must back the allied cause as their existence depended on an allied victory. This was no question of likes and dis likes and he was, so he said, continually making it clear to all who sought his advice that the Arabs must aid the allied cause in every possible way. Mention was made of Sir Percy Cox and the northern fron tier and his relations with Kuwait and Bahrain and he asked why I had not visited him when he was in camp with Shaikh ^Ajl^nad/iuo) ''' -5- Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah and Shaikli Ahmad bin Jabir as Subah at Gesuma in December last year when he had accorded me permission to enter his territory. I explained that it was due to the fact that I had no desire that a purely social gathering should be misinterested as a political meeting as a result of the arrival of a British official at their camp. He said he understood and had suspected that that was the reason. He drew my attention to the excellent relations which now existed between his country and Kuwait and then lectured me on how to deal with Arabs. Force and diplomacy alone were necessary he maintained, by their skilful use you could do what you liked with the Arab, it seemed that force was to be preferred and diplomacy was only to be called in when adequate force to achieve the object was lacking. The conversation was entirely one sided and lasted the best part of three quarters of an hour. At last the end came and he stopped speaking and seemed to be rather exhausted by his effort for he complained of the heat and then we talked of the tribesmen camped outside his gates and how they came from far and near and how tiiey lived as his guests for three days and each party came to receive his customary gift of from one thousand to fifteen thousand rials and a quota of rice etc. Much as I would have liked to remain I felt that the time had come to ask permission to lea^e and it was granted with a pleasant smile and then I noticed his eyes, one very bright and keen, and the other clouded with what looked like a cataract. He asked me what I proposed to do and suggested that I went to Al Karaj to see the agricultural developments there and Heshdi Mulhes was summoned and directed to see that I went immediately after lunch and that as he, Reshdi, was busy with the post Yusuf Yasin f s nephew Tahir Effendi Redhwan should accompany me. I would spend the night there and return the following afternoon in time to dine with him that evening.In accordance with Ibn Saud's orders we left in mid- afternoon and crossing a particularly uninviting, hot and dreary fifty miles of country came after some two hours travel to fields of Alfalfa, green and kind to the eyes. Just before we reached the green fields we were met by the nephew of Shaikh Abdullah bin Suliman, the Minister of Finance. Driving through the fields we came to a small village with a large and pleasant house obviously of recent construction on the right with a smaller one slightly in the rear of it and learnt without surprise that the large house was the property of His Majesty and that it was nearing completion and that the smaller one would be used by the Amir Saud and lesser lumin aries. We passed a threshing machine at work with clouds of fine dust hanging in the still air and turned left to the Minister's house, a pleasant place of white arches and courts. The Minister was awaiting us, a Nejdi of small and spare build with thin features, slightly prominent eyes, and of \ e dark complexion he ?/as dressed completely in thin white cotton with a white cotton or muslin shawl on his head, an incred ibly hard worker as I was to discover later with an appetite out of all proportion to his size. He had iived for ten years in Bombay doing business I gathered but I have since heard it stated that he was employed in a humble capacity in his youth by a Nejdi business house and I also heard it stated while I was in his house that he has a finger in every Saudi Arabian pie including the army. To a very superficial observer he seems to be a live wire with whom it would be as well to be on good terms. We sat and drank coffee and tea in little glasses with sugar and smoked cigarettes until it was cooler and then we drove out to see the estate which has been in existence three years and is the result of the drive and in^itiative of Shaikh/\\ /o? -7- \ Shaikh Abdullah. We watched them winnowing corn by hand and then went to the motor thresher and examined the grain and from there to the donkey^ quarters, fine white animals from Hasa, one of which had a sore back which at once attracted Shaikh Abdullah's notice and he gave instructions for it to be dressed, then to the working bullocks and I listened to a discourse on how the larger animals from the Tihamah had been tried but had proved a failure owing to their being accustom ed to a sandy soil and the hard rock surface of the country round A1 Karaj had injured their feet. We drove into the fields and saw Zinnias flowering, roses, orange trees, pomer- granets, grape vines, melons and many varieties of green vegetables such as cucumbers and raddishes. Then over to the wells which produce the water for this enterprise which Shaikh Abdullah said was now paying in spite of feeding 600 horses and many other animals. There are many wells but three of note and these are really small lakes sunk some fifteen to twenty feet below the surface of the surrounding rock about thirty yards in length and of varying width. The water in the first one I came to was 420 feet deep and was being pumped through what looked like an eight inch pipe by a Blackstone oil engine, I was told the rate of flo?/ which was very impressive but which I have forgotten. I was much im pressed by Shaikh Abdullah's knowledge of the work and the effeciency math which everything was being done and the clean liness of all the machinery. We passed on to look at the canal which is being constructed by two American Engineers to run 20 kilometers to irrigate new areas of wheat land and I had the pleasure of meeting the younger of the Americans at his small house near the starting point of the canal. The elder was apparently on a few days leave at Dhahran the C.A.S.O.C's headquarters. He gave us clean cold water with ice, very welcome, and explained how the canal was being dug with some sort of automatic machine and would be faced with local stone and local lime both available on the spot1/ As the evening fell we came home and I went off to change and bathe in a somewhat primitive manner from a corrugated iron tank with the aid of a small pint measure. The water was remarkably cold and refreshing and I returned comfortably clad in a white cotton 'dishdasher' to the cen tral court to find carpets had been spread and my host was reclining in the centre of them looking remarkably cool and collected. I joined him, leaving my sandals at the edge of the carpets and we talked of a number of things including India on which subject my host waxed indignant and eloquent over the Congress question. Congress* attitude was inexplic able to him and our lack of drastic action in regard to them even more so and I was treated to a lecture on firmness and how essential it was when dealing with orientals especially in war time. Suddenly my host broke off from advocating the use of the Indian States to stamp out the Congress and sug gested dinner. I agreed and he had but to raise a hand to bring running a servant lad armed with a Mauser pistol who had been squatting with a companion similarly armed at the far end of the courtyard. The lad listened to his Master's orders and ran off to have them executed which they were in a remarkably short space of time and he returned to announce that dinner awaited our pleasure. After dinner we returned to the courtyard and drank coffee and I had an opportunity of talking to Hussein A1 Uweini the Packard Agent and Ibn Saud's Agent in Beirut who had been introduced to me at dinner but with whom I had not so far had much conversation. He talked of the difficulties of war time trade and the lack of a decent hotel in Kuwait. The following day I drove round with Shaikh Abdullah, Tanir i^fxendi and Hussein A1 Uweini to see the other parts of the estate and returned to the house to listen for hours to Hussein A1 Uweini on the iniquitousness of the Free and l/iohy French in Syria while my host went and slept. Why,M ' 0 *-9— I was asked, did we not take over Syria for the duration of the war and for twenty years afterwards, why did we leave the Syrians to the mercy of the Free French who were no different from the Vichy French and who took just as many bribes. Syria's position was hopeless with the Jews to the south and the Turks to the north and the French in possession, verily they were like sheep led to the slaughter house. I ventured to suggest that perhaps the Syrians had no desire to be ruled by Great Britian even for the duration of the war whereupon Hussein became most excited and said that it was exactly what the Syrians did want and called on Tahir Effendi for his ppinion which was exactly the same. I wonder. I tired of these two after three and a half hours and went up to my room but it was remarkably hot and the floor seemed very uninviting, the room had not even an 'easy' chair, so 1 was forced to return to tlie Syrians and try and guide their conversation into less trying channels. I was partially successful but was profoundly glad when mine host came in looking refreshed after his sleep and suggested liinch. After lunch we rested for rather more than an hour and then bidding farewell to our host drove the fifty odd miles back to Hiyadh in a dust storm. We got back about 5 p.m., a little more than an hour before I was required to be present at the 'Marabah' for dinner. I bathe* and changed into my Sunday best and did my utmost with a light coloured gold embroidered 'Bhist' or cloak and a white muslin head cloth tastefully decorated with white 'forget -me-nots' to up hold the prestige of the Government of India. I was no sooner ready than I found Reshdi Mulhes and Tahir Effendi waiting so off I went in their company to the entrance to the 'Marabah' palace, now the courtyard was des erted except for the Guard of Honour, along empty passages to/to a small office where we sat and waited as we were seem ingly rather early and then out into a corridor at the end of which I could see the princes of the blood disappearing up a narrow staircase, we hurried after them and found our selves on a flat roof with two rows of divans flanking car pets at the end of which stood an enormous chair with great stuffed cushions and a telephone, on either side of which were two low sofas. The members of the household sat on the divans on the right and the Amir Abdullah bin Abdur Rahman His Majesty 1 s brother, the Amirs Saud and Faisal on the left, I was introduced to the Amir Abdullah by the Amir Saud and parked myself on the sofa on the left of the ,f throne ,f . I talked to the Amirs in Arabic and as they were some fifty feet away from me and everyone else sat like mutes it was not particularly enjoyable but all went well and there were no embarassing pauses. Some twenty minutes were passed in this manner while the row of slaves behind the princes look ed steadily to their front then a commotion to my rear drew my attention to a number of people entering the stage from a small doorway immediately behind me and I was surprised to see Ibn Saud appear suddenly from what seemed to me to be quite the most inappropriate direction for we all sat facing the entrance to the lift up which I believed all of us thought he would come. We all rose and His Majesty came for ward and I advanced to greet him and shook hands. He sat down on the padded chair and we resumed our seats, not for very long however for we had scarcely said two or three words on the subject of A1 Karaj before dinner was announced and Ibn Saud asking me if I was ready led the way from one roof to another past blind men reciting the Koran and pro ceeded by a lad walking backwards with a censer of burning sandle/sandle wood presumably lest any foul odours should assail one^ nostrils. At length after passing several narrow doorways we found ourselves on a s^pacious roof spread with carpets and with the dinner laid out on a long white table cloth in the centre. It was a noble meal with three (§heep roasted whole and dozens of side dishes and sweetmeats and fruits. Ibn i , Saud sat at one end with myself on his right and Dr. Midhafc Shaikh al Ard next to me and then the other members of the household while the Amirs sat on Ibn Saud^ left. Slaves stood round and one in particular busied himself with look ing after me though I was easily capable of doing so myself. I noticed that we all sat in shoes except Ibn Saud and that everyone pecked at the food with forks and spoons except Ibn Saud and myself and we used our hands. Servants stood behind holding glasses of water in pretty glasses with gilt edges and one turned and drank when one felt inclined. Ibn Saud ate more than any of us and when he% had finished turned to the servant behind him and seized an enormous green enamel mug with red flowers that must have held a couple of pints and emptied it, no silly fancy gilt rimmed glasses for him and I absolutely agreed with him. We rose and washed our hands and retraced our steps to where we had sat before dinner and after a few minutes cofifee arrived and the infenQe burner immediately after it so I made my excuses and after arranging for a farewell interview at 3 6*Clock Arabic the next morning bid farewell and left escorted by Reshdi Mulhes. The following morning I drove alone to the city for my last audience and talked to the Amir Saud for some time before Ibn Saud'was ready to receive me. Our conversation ranged from the Duke of Hamilton's Scots seat to the Pilgrim- age what/ ■what time we drank tea in the usual little glasses followed by cold sweet drinks. Reshdi who had been sitting quietly in a corner suddenly announced that Ibn Saud was waiting so His Royal Highness and I said farewell in very warm terms and I followed Reshdi along the usual route to Ibn Saud's reception room through the usual crowd of supplicants, ser vants, soldiers, slaves, and officials and found him in the usual corner looking as if he had not moved since last I had seen him there forty eight hours before. My tQwy servants and Shaikh Ahmad*s man, Adas, came in and kissed his hand and a clerk appeared with a freshly written letter, Ibn Saud sai? down and so did I and I waited for the clerical gentle man to come forward and have his letter signed but he show ed no inclination to do so and as Ibn Saud continued to look at me I presumed he was waiting for me to say my say and get me gone so I asked permission to leave which merely brought a surprised look to his face so I tried again and the look of surprise increased and for one dreadful moment I felt I must have dropped some incredible brick and used an ill chosen word but I had but used a formula that I had used ten thousands of times during the last eleven years and the third time was lucky for the great man's thoughts came to earth and the usual reply was made and then we chatted for a few minutes and I thanked him for his kind gift to myself and my servants which Abdur Rahman Tobashi had brought to the Biddiah house just before I left for this interview and which included besides the usual 'Bhists' and shawls a gold watch and a gold dagger for myself and a money gift for each of the servants. He replied by saying that it was just something to remember him by and I made what I trust was a suitable answer and we rose and he gave me messages for Shaikh Ahmad and Dickson and with a mutual farewell/for each other T s peace we parted and I withdrew from/(W) ' f from the room and tlie palace, and presumably the waiting clerk got his letter signed. After lunch I drove to within a mile of Hamah at the oGiotoicn edge of the Dhahna Sands and there halted for the night by the side of the road, we followed the 11 A1 Malaf M road which has no pass like the Bewaib road but was much the same as regards lack of interest. The night was warm so it was no effort to get up at 3.30 a.m. on the 27th and start packing up for the next stage of the journey. We drove into Ramah and found a smart looking Station Waggon waiting there for us with letters from Ibn Saud for Shaikh Ahmad. They were handed over to me and I signed a receipt for them and realised the reason for the confusion at my last meeting with Ibn Saud for the clerk with the letter was obviously waiting to have it signed so that I could convey it to Shaikh Ahmad from Ibn Saud and my insistence on leaving had made him unwilling to ask me to wait while the letter was put into an envelope so he had with some reluctance agreed to my departure and sent the letter after me by special messenger. We left Hamah at 5. i.m. and negotiated the Dhahna Sands without incident arriving at Ma'agla at 8.15 a.m. where I proposed to await my lorry which I had lost sight of some miles back. Eventually news of the lorry arrived to the effect that it had broken a spring but could carry oufr repairs % I considered the situation carefully and decided that I would be unwise to attempt to travel to Dhahran via Iluinat^ over a sandy and to me unknown road in the summer heat un accompanied bjt another vehicle and that the only alternative would be to travel via Jariyal al Iliyah which involved a very considerable extra milage and would really be a waste of time. As it seemed to be understood in Riyadh that it had been my original intention to travel from Riyadh to Hofuf and they/they themselves had disuaded me from attempting the journey owing to the condition of the sands and as they would un doubtedly hear of my lorry difficulties I saw no object in proceeding further with the Dhahran part of the journey and decided to return to Kuwait. I arrived at Kuwait just before 7 p -aa . The heat was intense at Riyadh, travelling uncomfor table and the sand flies and mosquitoes voracious but I was amply repaid for such minor discomforts by my kindly and friendly reception by His Majesty King Ibn Saud.(rljll Confideatial* II 7 B0.795-S of 1942.

Whilst little of interest has happened in Saudi Arabia itself and whilst this report must mainly 'be a recording of the impact on the country of events outside^ the war did for a few days come closer to Saudi Arabia. On the 3rd. April a message was received that three Italian destroyers which had escaped from Massawa were making for Jedda# ■ To the relief of the local author ities, who had received the news of the impending arrival of the ships with consternation, they were driven ashore by combined naval and air action some ten miles to fifteen miles south of Jedda and scuttled by their crews. In the course of this action Saudi territory was fairly contirhftOiel^ violated for more than an hour by the Royal Air Force. One pilot, mistaking a. pilgrim ship at anchor in jedda harbour for one of the destroyers, dropped a bomb and, having scored a near miss, machine-gunned the legation launch as it left the pilgrim ship. This activity, though appreciated neither by the captain of the pilgrim ship nor by the five members of the Legation staff on board the launch, was understandable as alongside the British ship was the H Asia n , a burnt out French pilgrim ship lying on her side, mistaken by the pilot for a damaged destroyer. The captain f s wrath was somewhat allayed by a signal from the British destroyer engaged: 'sorry you have been troubled^ Therewere no casualties or damage. Ibn Saud issued a formal official protest to His Majesty's Government explaining privately at the same time that he personally did not mind but that if he allowed his territory to be violated without protest he woui4 himself open to criticism by the 'others 1 ^ - the Axis*. 4. As a result of this ■engagement:. th^ -three -deetroye-ps, unhurt except for sore feet, struggled into Jedda and were interned* The number of the internees was swelled during the following weeks by the arrival of small parties of Italian and German merchant seamen who had fled from Massawa in their ships' boats. Five small parties also arrived by aetfcolane from Asmara; these after short periods of detention were allowed to proceed. The presence of these internees has., been a constant source of annoyance. The Italian Minister protested vigorously against the internment of the civilians as being contrary to Inter national law but Ibn Saud stood firm on the ground that these, men had landed on his territory without permission and aould either remain interned or be expelled, pointing out that the latter course would be tantamount to handing them over to a British author^, ity as they must necessarily pass through British controlled territory or waters en route for their own or a neutral country* Ibn Saud felt himself unable in the absence of any precedent to agree to a suggestion.that, as his attitude towards His Majesty's Government was that of non belligerency rather than neutrality, he might hand over all his internees to us* He did not regard the handing over of internees in Iraq, as a sufficiently good pre cedent#. 5. Italian stock, never high/ fell even lower as a result of the arrival of the tattered crews of the scuttled destroyers. An attempt.was made by the Italian Government to replace their inept Minister, Signer Sillitti, by Signor Grolla, but Ibn Saud refused permission for the latter to make the journey by aeroplane#-. Towards the end of the year the funds of the Italian Legation were exhausted and Signor Sillitti appealed to the Saudi Government • r i , ass: ^ s ^ anC6 * • Saud arguing that it was not consistent with his sense of Arab dignity and hospitality to allow a foreign representative 5 whose function made him an honoured guest, to starve, sanctioned a fairly generous allowance, the amounts so /advancedvm 'Mi M French did not help to endear the latter whom he described as 'just a slice from the same old loaf 1 '# However, following his policy that nothing must be done to hinder Britain 's war effort, he • has constantly advised Syrian nationalist leaders, notably Shukri Kuwatli for whom he has a high regard, to rely on the British declar- terations of Syrian independence and to keep quiet until the war has :• ...been won. He followed the lead of His Majesty's Government in jjii recognising the Syrian Government. lO e As regards Palestine his policy has followed the same lines, no awkward questions to be raised during the war but confidence in Britain's determination to implement her promises 0 A Saudi Consul- ;General was appointed during the year to reside at Jerusalem. ■V':' &lt; o : ; -, He Relations with Trans-Jordan were at one moment strained V. owing to the somewhat tactless action of the Amir Abdullah in com- bining in one telegram a message cf congratulation on the occasion of the Ramadhan feast and some gratuitous advice to Ibn Saud as to the manner in which he should deal with members of the Sherifian : family in t^ie Hejaz implicated in a childish and futile plot against .; the Saudi regime* Ibn Saud did not suspect that the Amir Abdullah was implicated in the plot but felt that he was showing undue sym- . : pathy with the guilty. The Amir's alleged intrigues in Syria also aroused Ibn Saud's suspicions but a visit to i^nman by Abdul Aziz -: Sudairi cleared the air and resulted in an exchange of gifts and protestations of mutual regard® ,8^' ■ • ' ' Relations with Bgypt were good though there was some minor , iepartmeastai about th# ot new Jedda-'Mccoa road.

The progress of the campaign in .;Libya was naturally followed v/ith the closest attention. ^-bn Saud 's . opinion of the attitude of the Egyptians and of the part they are \ playing in the struggle is not high. The bombing of Cairo - centre ■^of Moslem culture - angered him and he issued a firm protest. 13. Progress was made during the year towards agreement on the • , final texts of the Koweit-Saudi Bon Voisinage, Commeilcial and '. Extradition Agreements and there seemed, .good hope that they would a 1% ^••jbe ready for signature early in the following ■&gt;« 14, The decision of His Majesty's Government to occupy Persia •, had Ibn Saud's entire approval. He disappr^vadof the hospitality •accorded by the Persian Government to Axis agents and from the point of view of his own security realised that the occupation extended v: the barrier opposing any possible Axis advance towards his territory. A pleasing immediate result of the occupation of Persia and the removal of the Shah was the attendance at the pilgrimage of a greater ; number of Persian pilgrims than had been seen for many years. 15, The first reaction to the entry of Japan into the war was 'V, one of satisfaction that t^e^United States of America would play a more active part in the war/inspite of the American reverse at pearl Harbour it was felt that the Japanese had no hope of ultimate vict ory, Ibn Saud had always felt that the United States of America should be helping us not only with supplies but with men and had even suggested for His Majesty's Government's consideration an appeal by him to President Roosevelt in which he would point out that the :British could not be expected to maintain strong forces at every l; , .point and urging ;the President to send a strong American force to Bti'yp t, The question of Arab Federation was brought up by the Saudi /Arab— i- 1 Arabian Minxstsr in London 'but Ton Saud made it clear that this was a personal move on Hafiz wahba ♦ s part, ibn Saud f s view on this subject is that whilst there is no harm in Arab statesmen thinking and .discussing this question among themselves, if they wish to do soj the present is not the time for conferences or ' declarations* The energies of all should be directed solely ;■ towards the assurance of Britain's victory in the war without which^not only will there be no question of federation but no ,,, Question eve-n of independence of any Arab state* 17,, Although as stated in the opening paragraph of this report tne opinion of the population, which cannot as in other countries i; affect uhe policy of the Government, is of minor importance it is satisfactory to be able to record that by the end of the year the number of Hejazis who evinced sympathy for the Nazi regime had greatly aiminished^ There has never been any love fpr the Ital ians and there is now only contempt.

IN Saudi Arabia, where the Government is not only centred on the King but where the King, aided by counsellors and advisers with the courtesy title of Ministers, is the Government, the King's attitude dictates that of his subjects and is alone of importance. But though Ibn Saud is an absolute monarch, he is, and is recognised to be, a benevolent despot, and the wisdom of his policy of friendship with and reliance on Britain is appreciated even by those elements who wish that such a policy were unnecessary. Ibn Saud's personal attitude is thus of the greatest importance, for it dictates the attitude, or at least the policy, of the country as a whole. This attitude has been through the year, as will appear from succeeding paragraphs, not only satisfactory but most helpful. Whilst pre serving the outward appearance of neutrality, Ibn Saud has never failed to show, by his reactions to events and by his advice to those Arabs who have consulted him, where lay his inclinations and the interests of his country and of the Arabs generally. As the war has progressed and as the wall of British and British- controlled territory has closed around him, and as the scarcity of pilgrims, especially those of the richer class, has driven the country into bankruptcy, he has, of course, become more and more dependent on the goodwill of His Majesty's Government for the very existence of ihis country. This dependence, coupled with his known friendship, loyalty and confidence, provides ample assurance that his policy of co-operation will be continued. His confidence in British strength and in an ultimate British victory is unshakable. An illustration of his attitude was afforded when H.M.S. Hood was lost. His counsellors wore inclined to draw the conclusion that not even the British navy could stand up to the Germans. The King invited them to wait for a few days and they would see. When His Majesty's hope was realised and the Bismarck was sunk all those in attendance stood up at the King's command and clapped. 2. The year opened with the poorest pilgrimage since the Hejaz-Nejd war. The loss of Javanese and Malays, who alone among pilgrims stay for long periods and spend' freely, was especially serious from the standpoint of Saudi finance®. The drop in revenue collected from pilgrims, both directly in the shape of quaran tine dues and tax on travel by car or camel, and indirectly through taxation of those who had earned money through services to the pilgrims, necessitated frequent appeals to His Majesty's Government, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the United States Government for financial assistance. In addition to the £400,000 promised for 1941, His'Majesty's Government made two further advances of £250,000 each. Ten million Saudi riyals were also minted in India at a cost of roughly £450,000 and presented to Ibn Saud. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company made an advance of 3 million dollars, but the United States Government did not see their way to offering Government assistance to a country so clearly within the British sphere. In spite of this assistance, the Saudi Arabian Government ended the year with a deficit made up of unpaid bills and unpaid salaries of over £1 million. Ibn Saud has already asked for assistance in 1942 on a larger scale, including a credit for the purchase of foodstuffs in India. 3. Whilst little of interest has happened in Saudi Arabia itself, and whilst this report must mainly be a recording of the impact on the country of events out side, the war did for a few days come closer to Saudi Arabia. On the 3rd April a message was received that three Italian destroyers which had escaped from Massawa were making for Jedda. To the relief oi the local authorities, who had received the news of the impending arrival of the ships with consternation, they were driven ashore by combined naval and air action some 10 miles to 15 'miles south of Jedda and scuttled by their crews. In the course of this action Saudi [32-1]territory was fairly continuously violated for more than an hour by the Royal Air Force. One pilot, mistaking a pilgrim ship at anchor in Jedda harbour for one of the destroyers, dropped a bomb and, having scored a near miss, machine- gunned the legation launch as it left the pilgrim snip. This activity, though appreciated neither by the captain of the pilgrim ship nor by the five members of the legation staff on board the launch, was understandable as alongside the British ship was the Asia, a burnt-out French pilgrim ship lying on her side, mistaken by the pilot for a damaged destroyer. The captain's wrath was some what allayed by a signal from the British destroyer engaged ; ' Sorry you have been troubled.' There were no casualties or damage. Ibn Baud issued a formal official protest to His Majesty's Government explaining privately-at the same time that he personally did not mind, but that if he allowed his territory to be violated without protest he would lay himself open to criticism by the ' others ' —the Axis. 4. As a result of this engagement the entire crews of the three destroyers, unhurt except for sore feet, struggled into Jedda and were interned. The number of the internees was swelled during the following weeks by the arrival of small parties of Italian and German merchant seamen who had fled from Massawa in their ships' boats. Five small parties also arrived by aeroplane from Asmara; these, after short periods of detention, were allowed to proceed. The presence of these internees has been a constant source of annoyance. The Italian Minister protested vigorously against the internment of the civilians as being contrary to international law, but Ibn Saud stood firm on the ground that these men had landed on his territory without permission and could either remain interned or be expelled, pointing out that the latter course would be tantamount to handing them over to a British authority, as they must necessarily pass through British-controlled territory or waters en route for their own or a neutral country. Ibn Saud felt himself unable, in the absence of any precedent, to agree to a suggestion that, as his attitude towards His Majesty's Government was that of non-belligerency rather than neutrality, he might hand over all his internees to us. He did not regard the handing over of internees in Iraq as a sufficiently good precedent. 5. Italian stock, never high, fell even lower as a result of the arrival of the tattered crews of the scuttled destroyers. An attempt was made by the Italian Government to replace their inept Minister, Signor Sillitti, by Signor Crolla, but Ibn Saud refused permission for the latter to make the journey by aeroplane. Towards the end of the year the funds of the Italian Legation were exhausted and Signor Sillitti appealed to the Saudi Government for assistance. Ibn Saud, arguing that it was not consistent with his sense of Arab dignity and hospitality to allow a foreign representative, whose function made him an honoured guest, to starve, sanctioned a fairly generous allowance, the amounts so advanced to be deducted from a sum owing from before the war to the Italian Government. It was pointed out to him, however, that His Majesty's Government could not be expected to look favourably on an arrangement whereby a part, however small, of the sum advanced by them was devoted to keeping an Axis Legation in existence, and it was suggested as an alternative that Ibn Saud' should invite the Italian Minister to withdraw if he could not find means of providing himself with funds from other than Saudi Government sources. There was clear proof that the Italian Legation were abusing the hospitality of the country by the use of a transmitting set. By the end of the year Ibn Saud had agreed in principle to remove the Italian Legation and, pending their withdrawal, to give them only sufficient cash for their living expenses. 6. The question of the withdrawal of M. Ballereau, the Vichy French Minister, was also discussed, but Ibn Saud was reluctant to remove him. He con sidered him harmless and the native population thought him mad, for how, otherwise, could his present pro-German and collaborationist views be squared with his previous loud-mouthed boasts that Paris would be defended to the last lamp-post and the struggle continued, if necessary, from North Africa. But Ibn Saud's main reason for wishing to retain M. Ballereau was the problem of the disposal of Fuad Hamza if he, in turn, were removed from Vichy. It was, the King thought/neither in his interest nor in that of His Majesty's Government to have Fuad Hamza back in the Middle East. 7. There was a brief period when it looked as though Fuad Hamza was being influenced by the attention paid to him by Nazi representatives. HeYl'X by|i iliai addressed long telegrams to Ibn Saud containing accounts of his conversations, lissJ from which it was clear that he had neither attempted to counter, nor listened in tiyi (}, silence to, the mixture of blandishment. Lies and threats to which he was treated. Ibn Saud wasted no time in putting him firmly in his place, pointing out that aW Saudi Arabia's interests lay solely with Britain and that if Hitler had, as he goji professed, the interests of the Arabs at heart, he would never have advised Ibn Saud to take any step which might result in the withdrawal of British WJ 'support. 8. Ibn Saud had, in his relations with the Rashid Ali Government, a difficult ly &gt; course to steer. He found it at first hard to believe that E-ashid Ali, for whom he had a personal regard and who had gone further than any otiher Iraqi statesman in meeting his wishes, notably in the matter of the Shammar chiefs, was taking money from the Axis. He advised Rashid Ali frequently that it was his duty, as ir , it was that of all Arabs, to do nothing to hinder Britain's prosecution of the war. lt ee He was unwilling openly to denounce Rashid Ali's Government as unconstitu- tional, pointing out that by so doing he would be cutting contacts which might be Jrj of value to His Majesty's Government and that the Moslem world knew T , without f any public declaration, on which side his sympathies and interests lay. The aero P age-old differences of opinion between Iraq and Saudi Arabia regarding the jproct Shammar tribes and the erection of frontier posts were again taken up by ' e j. Ibn Saud with the new Iraqi Government, but the questions were as far as ever Wsji f roni solution at the close of the year. 'Old tin; 9. Ibn Sand's pleasure at the entry of British forces into Syria, a step leien which he had for some months past been advocating, was very great. He was jtetatr disappointed, though less vocally so than his Syrian advisers, when it was seen ilypassfe that the administration remained in the hands of the French, and an unfortunate neutels incident, in which his son-in-law received scant courtesy from the Free French, to f. did not help to endear the latter, whom he described as ' just a slice from the entwi same old loaf.' However, following his policy that nothing must be done to Msiiti hinder Britain's war effort, he has constantly advised Syrian Nationalist leaders, as at: notably Shukri Kuwatli, for whom he has a high regard, to rely on the British declarations of Syrian independence and to keep quiet until the war has been won. heaniii -He followed the lead of His Majesty's Government in recognising the Syrian lebytltli Government. , ignite 10. As regards Palestine, his policy has followed the same lines, no awkward ijlj®; questions to be raised during the war but confidence in Britain's determination weieeiTto implement her promises. A Saudi Consul-General was appointed during the nee, li y ear t0 reside at Jerusalem. 11. Relations with Transjordan were at one moment strained owing to the somewihat tactless action of the Amir Abdullah in combining in one telegram a message of congratulation on the occasion of the Ramadan feast and some joverii gratuitous advice to Ibn Sand as to the manner in which he should deal with members of the Shereefian family in the Hejaz implicated in a childish and futile J plot against the Saudi regime. Ibn Saud did not suspect that the Amir Abdullah ' was implicated in the plot, but felt that he was showing undue sympathy with the l ® ' guilty. The Amir's alleged intrigues in Syria also aroused Ibn Saud's suspicions, II j but a visit to Amman by Abdul Aziz Sudairi cleared the air and resulted in an ise !i exchange of gifts and protestations of mutual regard. P r( f ^ 12. Relations with Egypt were good, though there was some minor depart- 1 ®mental squabbling about the completion of and payment for the new Jedda-Mecca road. This road, wihich has an excellent surface and is metalled for its whole gife® 1 length of 45 miles, was completed by the end of the year. The progress of the I campaign in Libya was naturally followed with the closest attention. Ibn Saud's W] opinion of the attitude of the Egyptians and of the part they are playing in the struggle is not high. The bombing of Cairo—centre of Moslem culture—angered dM ii! him and he issued a firm protest. jwsfe; 13. Progress was made during the year towards agreement on the final texts ided^ of the Koweit-Saudi ' Bon-voisinage,' Commercial and Extradition Agreements, Afr I(S , and there seemed good hope that they would be ready for signature early in the tliep rc | following year. ficliy' 14. The decision of His Majesty's Government to occupy Persia had r'gG# Ibn Saud's entire approval. He disapproved of the hospitality accorded by the Persian Government to Axis agents, and from the point of view of his own J P security realised that the occcupation extended the barrier opposing any possible &gt;2#111. Axis advance towards his territory. A pleasing immediate result of the occupa tion of Persia and the removal of the Shah was the attendance at the pilgrimage of a greater number of Persian pilgrims than had been seen for many years. 15. The first reaction to the entry of Japan into the war was one of satis faction that the United States would play a more active part in the war and, in spite of the American reverse at Pearl Harbour, it was felt that the Japanese had no hope of ultimate victory. Ibn Saud had always felt that the United States should be helping us not only with supplies but with men, and had even suggested for His Majesty's Government's consideration an appeal by him to President Roosevelt, in which he would point out that the British could not be expected to maintain strong forces at every point and urging the President to send a strong American force to Egypt. 16. The question of Arab federation was brought up by the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, but Ibu Saud made it clear that this was a personal move on Hafiz Wahba's part. Ibn Saud's view on this subject is that, whilst there is no harm in Arab statesmen thinking and discussing this question among themselves, if they wish to do so, the present is not the time for conferences or declarations. The energies of all should be directed solely towards the assurance of Britain's victory in the war without which not only will there be no question of federation but no question even of independence of any Arab State. 17. Altihough, as stated in the opening paragraph of this report, the opinion of the population, which cannot as in other countries, affect the policy of the Government, is of minor importance, it is satisfactory to be able to record that by the end of the year the number of Hejazis who evinced sympathy for the Nazi regime had greatly diminished. There has never been any love for the Italians and there is now only contempt. But for the Germans there was the admiration accorded to the top-dog, but the treatment by the Germans of conquered European peoples, especially of the Dutch, so high up in Hitler's list of races, has made many Arabs wonder what they,who are nearly at the bottom, could expect were the Nazis ever to hold a predominant position in the Middle East. The attack on Russia, with whom Hitler had so recently concluded a pact of friendship, was also a serious shock to Arabs, who felt that, if Hitler broke his word and made an unprovoked attack on an avowed friend, who was also a most powerful opponent,- no reliance could be placed on any promise made by him to weak Arab States. There was, moreover, towards the end of the year a growing understanding of the debt which the country owes to the British, who, in spite of the difficulties result ing from the war, not only assured the arrival of food ships but even provided shipping, badly needed elsewhere, for a greater number of pilgrims than in the circumstances could reasonably have been expected.n Confidential .

During the last three months I have been unable to obtain any confirmation of the suspicion that the present bin Jiluwi is not trusted by Ibn Saud. It is generally recognised that the famous Abdullah bin Jiluwi, during the latter years of his life, was not trusted by Ibn Saud and was fortunate to have been able to retain his high office. But no one from whom I have made inquiries has heard of any lack of warmth or trust in Ibn Saud 1 s relations with Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi. My latest informant, Dr. Harrison, who recently returned from a visit to Hasa, tells me that he has reason to believe that the present bin Jiluwi is on excellent terms with Ibn Saud, and is given his full confidence. Dr. Harrison believed that Ibn Saud 1 s ministers were, for this very reason, jealous of bin Jiluwi; and he added that, if there were suspicions of bin Jiluwi in Riyadh, they were entertained by the King 1 s ministers rather than by the King.

CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. [E 140/69/25] Mr. Stonehewer-Bird to Mr. Eden.—{Received January 7, 1943.) (No. 52:) Sir, Jedda, December 13, 1942. 1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith an account drawn up by Mr. Wall of the five interviews which King Abdul Aziz granted me during his stay in Jedda. 2. I have asked Mr. Wall to reproduce as closely as possible the King's own words, as in this way a far clearer picture can be formed of the spirit and the wisdom of this truly great man. 3. King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud's present most friendly attitude is due in large measure to his genuine appreciation of the generous and helpful attitude of His Majesty's Government in these most difficult times. Owing to the serious drop in his two sources of revenue, pilgrimage and oil, he has found himself with a revenue of approximately 10 per cent, of his expenditure. Export restrictions imposed by all countries surrounding him and the scarcity of shipping space has rendered the supplying of his country with sufficient food, motor transport and other necessities a most difficult question. His Majesty has genuinely appreciated the efforts which have been made to solve this problem, more vital to this than to surrounding countries, as Saudi Arabia, which grows practically no food and has no industries, is dependent on imports for its existence. 4. The King's policy is based on the firm conviction that the interests of the Arab world lie in the victory of the Allied nations and in a continuation of, and, indeed, an increase in, British influence in the Near East. As will be seen from the accompanying record. His Majesty does not believe in a union of existing Arab States, each of whom, he says, has its own characteristics. What he hopes for is, that all Arab States, whilst remaining independent of one another, will be united by the common bond of friendship and closest co-operation with the British. Times have changed and weak States cannot stand alone, and unless the Arab States look to Britain for protection against external aggression and to act as intermediary in their disputes one with another they will inevitably fall under some foreign domination. 5. The King's statement, that we do not need to do any propaganda as he himself is our best and most effective propagandist, is literally true. The King has consistently, from the outbreak of war, backed the Allies to win, grieved over their set-backs and rejoiced in their successes. Three examples will serve to illustrate his attitude. When E.rance fell, he sent me a personal message expressing grief at the difficulties which the British would now have to face but assuring me of his full confidence in a final British victory. When H.M.S. was lost and certain of his counsellors suggested that even on sea the British were being beaten, he bade them have patience for a few days, and when the Bismarck was sunk these same counsellors were made to stand up and clap. His religious advisers, the Ulema of Nejd, criticised him for his distress over General Rommel's advance into Egypt, saying, that he, a Moslem, was endangering his health and reducing himself to a mental state, which was causing him to neglect his duty, over a quarrel between unbelievers. His Majesty berated his critics most soundly, pointing out at the end of his lecture on the reasons for his policy, that his friends, the British, were certainly Christians and not Moslems but that, were it not for their generosity and help and their-success in keeping Rommel out of Egypt, they, the Ulema, would have no food in their bellies and no clothes on their backs. 6. Ibn Saud's views on the present position of Germany are interesting and picturesque. He likeiis Hitler to a man who has stuffed himself with much and varied food (the countries of Europe) in the belief that he will derive great strength from his meals. But he has swallowed, not nourishing food, but a number of vipers and scorpions, and whilst these tear at his vitals, the lions, Britain, America and Russia, attack him. [37—29] Bif i IMF 7 In one of our interviews, at which the resident Middle East Supply Centre representative and the recently appointed British transport adviser attended, Ibn Sand showed great understanding of the difficulties which faced His Majesty's Government in their endeavour to keep Saudi Arabia supplied with even their minimum requirements in food and especially transport. His Majesty felt, g%, however, that he must stress the vital necessity for keeping his transport system ' in proper working order as on it depended not only the feeding of the population in outlying districts but the maintenance of public security throughout his vast * ternUiry^ ^ la8t report f rom Jedda. without acknowledging my debt to Mr. Wall whose knowledge of the language and sympathetic insight y ■ j have contributed so greatly to the atmosphere of friendship and perfect under- •&gt;&gt;.„ standing which has always obtained at my interviews with King Abdul Aziz. .# 9 I am sending copies of this despatch with its enclosure to His Majesty 8 &lt; Minister of State, Cairo, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, His Majesty s Ambassador Cairo, His Majesty s Ambassador, Bagdad, the High Commissioner for Palestine, the Governor of Aden His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, His Majesty s Minister, Beirut, and the ' it ,n ' i! j • i 'P QT'OT Q n rVnlt Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf I have, &amp;c.

Memorandum. of Conversations between His A hdul J^z Ibn .ijtoi and His Majesty's Minister at J 6-10, mz. liiajtcl HIS Maiesty, contrary to his usual practice, came to Jedda before th 0 pilffrimasre this year. He arrived early in the morning of the 5th December and received the members of the Diplomatic Corps the same morning, each ^ mission being received separately, as has been done since the outbreak ot war ^ His Maiesty's Minister accompanied by his staff was received 10- o . . The conversation was confined entirely to formal compliments and lasted only ten minutes. His Majesty was suffering from a slight cold which had given him a sore throat and made his voice somewhat husky. . , ■ , 3® A private interview was arranged for His Majesty s Minister at the Kings ^ ^ request every morning while he was in Jedda. 'Even though there may be no ^ business to discuss,' said the King, ' I love talking. 5 ' On one occasion, ^when iifiitt to ness to discuss, said the King, i love taiKing. wn unc His Maiesty's Minister had expressed a fear that he had taken up a good deal ; of His Majesty's time, the King replied ; ' We have no business except with you, ' we came to Jedda this time just to talk to you. His Maiesty's Minister was accompanied by Mr. Wall as interpreter, bheikii - ^ Yusuf Yasin was present at all the interviews, and the Amir Eeisal at most ot them. One interview at which questions of supply were discussed was attended by Hamad-al-Suleiman, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Najib Salha, o± the • Ministry of Finance, who has been specially appointed to deal with supply •: matters. Lieutenant-Colonel Griffin, resident representative of the Middle East : .'Supply Centre, and Maj'pr Shoosmith, the transport adviser, were also present at this meeting. The Amir Mansur, Ibn Sand's seventh son (by his favourite ^ wife, Umm Tallal, whom he had brought to Jedda with some of her smaller children), was present at one interview. Sir John Dashwood attended one •.ft interview. A® The interviews took place in the main reception room of the palace: a vast and windy hall with the furniture so arranged that it is almost impossible to hear anything spoken except by the person on your immediate left or right. The King sat in the middle chair of a row placed across one end of the room, with ^ His Majesty's Minister on his right and the Amir Feisal, Yusuf Yasin and the others a good way down one side of the room, just within, or perhaps just out of, hearing. When it was necessary for any of them to join in the conversation 5^ they could only do . so by coming forward and squatting on the carpet in front of the King. (There was no loss of dignity in this, for the King and his people ^ , have carried the manners of the tent into their palaces.) |m| Before conversation began the crowd of armed and richly garbed bodyguard ^ was waved away through various doors and windows by a slight gesture of the ^ King's hand. LiA )&gt; \ Ibn Saud talks fast and says a great deal. He has a strong Nejdi accent, but in talking politics to foreigners he uses a fairly pure vocabulary, only lapsing into phrases of dialect when he warms to his subject. He has little tricks of speech—the Arabic equivalents of ' listen! ' and ' don't you see? '—with which he sprinkles every sentence. He gives to some ordinary Arabic words a peculiar and personal meaning : for example, ' A1 Hukoomah '—the Government—means in his speech, the Government, i.e., the British; and once a long and heated misunderstanding was only cleared up when it was found that the word ' Meezaniyah,' by which everyone else understood ' budget,' meant to Ihim any kind of inventory or list. He knows no foreign language, and his pronunciation of foreign names is no more than approximate. His mind is richly stored with fables, proverbs and tales of Arab history, with which, and, of course, verses of the Koran, he illustrates his points. His Majesty's Minister first of all told the King that he had been transferred on temporary duty to Morocco. ' This is sad and unexpected news,' Ibn Saud said. ' I don't want to lose you. Let me telegraph to the Government and ask them to let you stay.' His Majesty's Minister explained the reasons that had led His Majesty's Government to their decision. 'I know,' was the reply, ' that they are only transferring you because of your experience over there, but we benefit as much from your being here as the. Government hope to do from your being in Morocco. In all these difficult times it has been a great comfort to me to know that you were here in Jedda working day and night for us; it has been as if the Government itself were sitting here in our country.' His Majesty's Minister assured him that His Majesty's Government had given every consideration to His Majesty's interests in taking their decision, and that the old policy of firm friendship would 1 not be changed. He left behind him a staff who had followed all developments with him. ' True,' said the King. ' But our happy company will not be complete without you. You are one of us, and it's in the interests of the Government as well as our own that you should be here binding us together in our friendship.' (He made the Arab gesture of linking his two forefingers.) ' I am glad you're going to London; that will be good for us. But when you leave London I want you to come back here.' His Majesty's Minister asked if there were any particular matters or points of view which His Majesty might wish him to raise in London. 'You know everything we have to tell the Government as well as we do,' said the King. ' There is nothing that matters to this country and its sons that you have not as much at heart as they have.' The King reverted at every interview to the subject of His Majesty's Minister's departure. One morning he had called in his little sons, Nawwaf and Tallal, and one of his 5daughters, Mudhawi, a child of 2. He took the little girl on his knees, and as His Majesty's Minister took her hand, said to her : 41 Qooli me tarooh, abadan ma tarooh '—' Tell him not to go, not to go at all.' He spoke also, with a freedom from reserve noteworthy even in the familiar atmosphere that is usual in his interviews with His Majesty's Minister, of his 'family's' regret at the parting, 'family' here meaning Umm Tallal, who had entertained His Majesty's Minister's wife and daughter at Riyadh earlier in the year, and who received them again in Jedda during this visit of the King. His Majesty's Minister referred to the two major problems with which he had been concerned: finance and supplies, together with the related question of motor transport. He repeated what he had said in many previous talks : that His Majesty's Government would give all the help they could, and that if supplies were not always forthcoming just when needed, the reason was not an unwilling ness to help on anyone's part, but the fact that neither the supplies nor the ships to carry them could be found always when they were wanted. The King replied : 'I understand that perfectly. No one knows better than I how generously the Government have responded to our appeals. I am deeply grateful and wish to say so on all occasions. I know, too, that military needs must come before all others. If you carry rice to this country, perhaps you have to leave behind a tank that ought to be sent to Africa. That's the main thing— to beat the Axis. That's in our interest, as I'm always saying. But you know my habit: I like to tell the Government just how we are placed here in this country; to tell them everything and leave it to them, who know the general situation better than I, to do what they think is best for them and for us. [37—29] ' b 2j'L/h ' But the hungry man doesn't always understand. ' We are hungry and there are hungrier folk behind us,' as they say. This is a wide country. In our far-off parts, by the borders of Iraq and Transjordan, there are people starving. Then there is the question of money. Both here in the Hejaz and on the eastern side nothing comes in. With the new arrangements that we have made for getting supplies of food-stuffs, customs receipts have dwindled away. The demands on me increase. I have to give great sums in charity. All day and every day beggars are at my door and petitions pour in from great and small, all saying the same thing : ' I'm hungry, I want, I want, I want ' On this visit to the Hejaz I have found the money I brought with me for charity not enough. I have purposely left Ibn Suleiman (the Minister of Finance) behind in Nejd for a time so that I can stave off the clamorous by telling them to wait until Ibn Suleiman comes. I have insisted on the strictest economy in my own family and have not allowed any of them to come with me to Mecca this time unless they could pay their own way. ' I know the Government realise my difficulty and I believe they realise how much it is in their interest that this country should be at peace and cause no trouble at this difficult time. This is God's Holy Land; the eyes and hearts of all the Moslems turn towards it. It is as little in your interest as it is in ours that some of the ill-disposed among the Arabs—or some of that other family you know about {i.e., the Hashimites)—should be given an opening to make trouble here or spread hostile propaganda about us in the world. ' Then motor cars; they are vital to this country for two reasons : one, we must distribute food to every part of the kingdom. I have won this land and I am responsible for every part of it. They look to me from far and near and I must feed them. Second, we must have cars to maintain law and order. What do you think has enabled me to hold the unruly and factious in check, to pursue and punish the evil-doer, to make the law felt in every remote region of the land I The help of God, and after that the motor car. If I had no cars to carry my patrols, do you think there would be peace and order from end to end of the land as there is now ? ' The subject of propaganda was raised by His Majesty's Minister asking whether His Majesty would object to the B.B.C. broadcasting a message of congratulation from Lord Athlone on the anniversary of His Majesty's accession. The message would refer to His Majesty's loyalty and friendship for Great Britain. ' That,' replied the King with great emphasis, ' that's what I'm always broadcasting to my people! ' (The Arabic word for cc broadcast ' has the same wide significance as the biblical English ' publish.') ' As I said to Yusuf about the cinema : they {i.e., the British) don't need to do any propaganda here. I am their chief propagandist; I am their fifth column! ' (The legation had recently erected a cinema projector on an open balcony of the Chancery—the only place available—and someone had represented to the King that the great and enthusiastic crowd that assembled in the street to watch was contrary to good morals.) His Majesty's Minister began to explain about the cinema, but the King, smiling broadly, stopped him : 'As for the cinema, we have closed that door! ' (meaning that the matter was satisfactorily settled). ' But, as for propaganda, day and night in every ' majlis ' from of old I have told the Arabs that I am your friend, and told them why. Listen ! The reason is twofold.' The King resettled himself in his chair and tucked his stockinged feet under him in still a different position. ' We are people of religion. Nothing comes before that. If religion forbade me to be a friend of the British, I and my country and people would perish sooner than take their hand. But the very opposite is true, and for two reasons; first, Islam commands us to keep our word. I pledged myself in friendship to you long ago. I shall keep that pledge. If not, I am ruined in this world and the next. Seconld, the Koran, our Book, commands me to believe that the British are the friends of the Arabs. Listen! 'Alif Lam Mim. Ghulibat ir Rum fi adna Tardi . . . .! ' (His Majesty quoted Surat A1 Rum, Koran, chapter 30, v. 1, explaining the famous prophecy that the Byzantines would rise again after their defeat by the pagan Persians and win a great victory, whereat tlhe Moslems would rejoice, as indicating the victory of the British and their Allies over the tyrannous and anti-religious power of the Axis.) 'On that day the faithful shall rejoice,' repeated the King. ' Secondly, there is the good of my country. How often have I said to my people : ' How long do you think I should last if the Government were driven out of the East ? ' And over and above our material interest, what binds us to the Government is the # aii':&gt;! e j: dealing and honourable treatment we have always had from them. There are J J'f two kinds of relationships between countries : the relationship of fear—fear of Jt the subjected for the conqueror—and the relationship based on mutual interest and co-operation. That is the relationship between you and us. Who else would eve &lt; have treated us as you have? We were talking the other day and someone said : U sa ' sa ^ 118 : Come to us and we will treat you just like the people of ajUjj Berlin and Rome, and if at the same time the Government said to us : Come to ■jj. 1 fJ 118 5 we cannot treat you like the people of London, but we will treat you like IW the people of our colonies, which should we choose? ' I say the latter, of course. It's as clear as the sun. How have those two rogues ' Hatler ' and ' Missoluni' Dt Illy treated their own people in Berlin and Rome? They have slaughtered them and tortured them most barbarously. But the Government treat the people of their lles 8tli e j colonies just like the sons of England. Look at India. A land of kings. Do you think anyone else, Arab or foreigner, who might have conquered India would have left those kings to enjoy their rights and privileges? No; they would have over- thrown and despoiled them.' iejesaij A reference to the decision of Safi-el-Din-el-Senussi not to come on pilgrimage tasitiif, and stay in the Hejaz made the King chuckle : That's not a decision of the lerfailj Senussi. It is the mercy of God, who strengthened the British to defeat the iiafetnjj Germans at A1 Alamein.' Much time at each interview was spent in discussing the war news and the breast g enera l situation. Ibn Saud expressed admiration for America's war effort, won thislu President Roosevelt is a man like your Prime Minister, and it is to the world's far aid!■ fr^une that there are two such men in such close agreement at this time, landotii •^ a ^ ons are veined by their leaders. A thousand lions led by a fox are nothing; 'inckt,! f thousand foxes led by a lion are an army. These leaders are different from that ; regiil ' Hatler ' ; tile y ru ^ by consent, not by terror, and they have won the admiration no cars t an( ^ su PP ort 9'^ their nations because they have never feared to tell the truth, id toe# The y an ^ their Governments will last because they seek to do right. We believe profoundly that the works of evil cannot endure.' v'sl* ' Hitler an(i Mussolini have chosen a path that can only lead to disaster. Mussolini—but what is Mussolini? Mr. Churchill spoke a word about him that l u L ' Phased me : he called him a jackal. They have made grave mistakes. Hitler : J; 1 , ! made two: first when he failed to invade England after the French were ray defeated. We were sorely grieved and afraid at that time, for we knew there was no army in England to withstand them. But the mercy of God is evident. J, f. Hitler erred and you did not neglect his error. Then he erred in attacking tost Russia; first, because that gave you a breathing space, and, second, because he saidtok had not reckoned the Russian resistance rightly. Nor had anyone—it is a wonder lagdak of this war. igatioik 'Hitler now is like a man who has swallowed all manner of serpents, vipers ery-tk and scorpions, all alive and furiously biting in his belly, then while he is at tier struggling with this internal attack he is set upon by lions. The serpents and iS coDtffi scorpions are those countries, Poland and Czecho—what-d'ye-call-it; the lions are you and Russia and America. What shall he do? Try and overcome the jiajrii' convulsions within him or defend himself from the lions outside? If God will, ctediit! he will be torn apart both ways. asfepl People talk about a second front. I say the British will not open a second istf |! ront m Europe. Those places, Belgium and Holland, are well guarded. The Thefif man looks f or an opening. There was a time when I thought you might iu Jjl tr y and capture or destroy the French fleet in that place in France where it lay, Jt u f aI ^ from there go on to invade France. Then again I often said you ouffht to Jef# the Ma g hrib (^•' French North Africa). Now you've done it. There's JL# y our 8econd front - 0nce drive the Germans out of there and you have the Axis Iti m t r e gri P of y our hand - And we and tlie Ara bs and all Moslems will rejoice on that day.' J At an interview at which Sir John Dashwood was present the talk turned ia , ! '■ 011 the misstatements and lies of German propaganda. lt il r !fl Sir John Dashwood q uo ted the reference in a recent German broadcast to cPf Rommel's advance westwards.' This delighted the King, ag# ' What Arab believes the German wireless now? We have heard them sink lei# the same ship three times over. Lies return upon the head of their disseminator verW As the Iraqi proverb says, ' Untruth is a mount will take vou forth but will not bring you home again.' ' Dg : His Majesty was asked what future he foresaw for the Arab States after e : f the war.' There is neither victory nor defeat save as God wills,'' replied the King. -He exate Xm He will and casts down whom He will. But after our snbmissfon to^hat primal trnth we believe most frmly futnre to thp Arabs depends on a British victory and tliat that victory is sure it is a vast subject, but I will try and show you briefly the reasoning that has led me to h0ld 'Men'ask • ' What do the Arabs think? What do the Arabs want? What will the Arabs do?' We have to say what the Arabs are, what are their quabtms tw0 characteristics : their Islam and their 1 Arabiyah' ('Arabism '-their racial and national feeling). But to be an Arab is not enough. There are still too many primitive and ignorant people among the Arabs for them to form themselves into a great united nation. There remains their Islam. that is something capable of being a basis on which to found a nation. That is if it be true Islam uncormpted by ignorance and innovation. A • 'States may have one of two foundations: either strict and undevia ing religion, the exact fulfilment of God's kw on earth, or a wise Constitution rejected and observed by all the people of the State. No Arab country to-day has e l &lt; t ^ e 0 h f ig t ^ of the Ar a bs h as been a tale of struggling for unity and power. They have been ruled bv a series of dynasties who all sought to weld them into one empire and to strengthen their hold over them, from the days of Bam Ummaiya and Abbas down to the Turks. ^ The lurks were the last to rule an Arab Empire. Thev kept it together and kept the Araos in subjection to them by three means : unceasing propaganda for the Turkish Khali fate—Sultan Abdul Hamid used to spend 7 million a year on propaganda, and his du at (secret political missionaries) were sent to the ends of the realm; flattery and bribery they pinned a medal on a noble Arab's chest and dazzled him with it until he could see nothing else; the deliberate keeping of the mass of the Arab people m ignorance and poverty so that they were too brutalised and spiritless to rise asainst them. Then there came the great war, and the Arabs stirred and rose, filled with the hope of throwing off the Turkish domination For the first time for many hundreds of years independence again seemed possible^ ihey tell under the rule of Britain and France. You know what I think about British rule—that I sincerely believe that it has been for the worldly good of the Arabs As tor the French rule—you know what I think about the French. But the Arabs had tasted freedom and now they want to feed full on it. . . , • • t 'In statesmanship there are two guiding principles: one ^ service ot country, property and person. The statesman in this is a merchant. Wnetner he is serving his country or his estate or himself he is making bargains, buying cneiap and selling dear. That is natural. Self-interest must always be one of the main motives of human action. The other principle is ' sharaf (honour and integrity),. Earthly success is unpredictable. Man's powers vary in different times and circumstances in inexplicable ways. At one time a man may seek to jump over that low table there and not be able to and be forced to draw back defeated. At another time he may leap over the mountain tops. Among the vicissitudes ol fortune and the strange chances of opportunity there is only one sure thing: to be true to one's own ideals. The man of integrity will retire in defeat unconquered, though fate may seem to have vanquished him yet he will be master of his fate because he has retained unimpaired his will to do right; he will watch the changes of circumstances and use every opportunity to advance in some measure the ideals he holds. Such a man will wade through dangers and undertake enterprises which others, who look only to immediate profit, view with fear and foreboding, because he knows the end he seeks is good. ' Until the statesmen of the Arab world understand these two principles and act on them there can be no independence for the Arabs. I don't see many men m Iraq, in Egypt, in Syria who are acting on them. They do not understand their countries' interest—not even their own. Look at Rashid Ali : the course I warned him against might well have led to his country's ruin. Let that pass—he cared not for his country's interest; you would have thought he might have cared for his own. No their chairs of office are dearer to them than their countries ' We have talked about Palestine. I, an Arab, tell you that the Arabs created the Palestine problem. Who but the Arabs called their conferences, raised their clamour and preached and prated about Palestine? And who were these Arabs ? They were three types : The man who sought to make a wordly reputation for himself and win fame in men's mouths; the adventurer who had no stake either iiiirakl Itltelj skiiilV ; in Palestine or in Syria; and the greedy man who sought merely to enrich p Mmself. , ^ '' Let the Arabs of each Arab country look to the improvement of their own ^ country first. There is so much they could do still undone. Let them develop their own agriculture and industry, make themselves prosperous and strong and happy. Then let them use their natural ties of blood and kinship to bind them- selves more closely one with another. It can be done—though it will take a long time—by treaties, by friendly understanding, by recognition of mutual interests. 1 1 Look at America : at first America was a collection of weak and separate States. ^ But each State strove to improve itself. It developed its own resources and became strong and prosperous, then put out its hand to its brother States and gradually united with them, until to-day America has become the greatest State on earth. So may the Arabs achieve union, if they will be honest and patient, for it will take a long time. '' The world is not, as some Arabs seem to think, an aeroplane or a motor car to be steered in the particular direction they want by the turn of the wheel. Worldly chances are incalculable; destiny will not accommodate itself to our desires. Who knows what the face of the world will be like after this war ? What new systems will be brought to life, what mighty States become no more than dust blown down the wind? We only know that it will be changed and a return to that state we were in before impossible. How vain were the hopes of those who held their conferences after the Great War seeking to return to the political and financial systems of before that war. ' But of the Arabs in that new world we can now state two things with certainty : First, the two basic principles of national interest and integrity that I have mentioned will still hold good, and it is on those that the Arabs must base the policy with which they face the new conditions. If they neglect those they will achieve nothing. Second, the Arabs, united or not, cannot stand alone. Where are their aeroplanes, their submarines, their destroyers ? They must rely on the friendship, help and protection of some Great Power. '' There are Governments besides the Government. Some of the others would gladly oust the Government from its place in the East. These enemies of ours, the Axis^—and especially the Germans^—are strong, no doubt. Strong enough to have made many Arabs look to them as the champions of Arab freedom and indepen dence. But I tell you that, if Germany came to the Arabs offering them the moon in one hand and the sun in the other, to accept their gifts would bring nothing but ruin and disaster upon the Arabs '' The Arabs have known the British Government for a long time now. The association has undergone many trials. Both sides have had much to complain of. But after it all, one truth emerges ever clearer : our interests are inevitably bound up together. No one but the Government can help and protect the Arabs, and if that help fail us we are lost. The Government is a tree well rooted and we are the leaves on its branches. If that tree is felled, shall we not wither and perish even before its roots ? ' In conclusion, I will mention three things that have written the lesson clearly. Three things in this war; two of them happened, one was averted. ' First, the German occupation of Europe. We have seen what they have done in Holland and Belgium and those places. Can the Arabs imagine that the Germans love them better than they love the people of Belgium? Second, the revolt in Iraq. The leaders of Iraq, ignoring both their loyalty to their word and their own interest, plunged their country into the worst possible dilemma. Had the Germans succeeded in remaining in Iraq but four months Iraq would have been utterly ruined. The British would have treated the Iraqis as traitors and enemies, and the Germans would have had but one object—to attack the British, and would have slaughtered every Iraqi who hindered them. ' Third, the threatened invasion of Egypt. The Arabs saw the key to the Arab world within the grasp of the Axis., and the battle of A1 Alamein showed them that no one stood between them and that disaster but the British Government. ' There is the truth : history has written it as clear as the sun. Our trust is in God and after that in the Government. This war at all times has proved it, and at no time more than when the Government seemed weakest and nearest to defeat. Now you have great Allies, America and Russia, with millions and with men. No one can now doubt that the Allies have overwhelming power and the issue is not now in doubt. But one thing alone brought this mighty alliance into being : one thing alone stirred America to action and convinced her that the cause was not lost. That was when you in your island, with all your Allies broken, stood8 firm against the world. But for that stand I think neither Russia nor America would have been inspired to fight, the arms of freedom would have been every where cast away, and in that general ruin what hope of Arab independence could survive ? His Majesty's Minister had a final interview with Ibn Saud at A1 Shumaisi 51 kilom. from Jedda on the road to Mecca, on Sunday, the 13th December. His Majesty's Minister delivered Mr. Eden's message about his transfer (Foreign Office telegram No. 304), and the conversation that followed was almost entirely personal. A small camp had been pitched, and after the sunset prayer His Majesty's Minister was entertained at dinner by His Majesty. Abdullah-al- Suleiman, Minister of Finance; Hamad-al-Suleiman, Yusuf Yasin and Najib Salha were also present. After the meal Ibn Saud himself annointed His Majesty's Minister's hand with his own perfume—a, powerful mixture of attar of roses and musk. ' I follow in the footsteps of the prophet,' remarked the King, ' and three things I love : perfume, women and prayer.') His Majesty's Minister took his final leave of Ibn Saud at 7*30 p.m.ondi'tions In Saudi Arabia )Uls see, food, including rice, was plentiful. He said that prices v /ere high but that, as the labouring and servant Saudi Arabia in the course of which they spent six weeks in Riyadh. Mr. Van Peursem reports that, so far as he could at Bahrain have recently returned from a medical tour in Dr. Storm and Mr. Van Peursem of the American Mission classes received their pay in food, the high prices did not greatly affect them. He saw no signs of starvation and heard no complaints about lack of food* 2. Dr. Storm confirmed what Mr. Van Peursem had told me independently. He thought that the general condition of the people was good. The only persons who appeared to be suffer ing were the Bedouin whose flocks and camels were in poor condition owing to lack of grazing during past seasons. He said that there were very few beggars in Riyadh and that the 1 suq 1 there had many things not available in Bahrain e.g. soap, toilet requisites and similar articles of every day use. 3. Dr. Storm said that everybody in Riyadh appeared to be in good spirits as a result of the excellent war news. He said that general feeling was in favour of the Allies. Hatred and contempt of Italy were universal. There appeared, however, to be apprehension about Russia's future policy and power. Ibn Saud mentioned to Dr. Storm during each of five or six interviews his expectation that Russia would demand a commercial outlet on the Gulf after the war. According to Dr. Storm views in Riyadh about Russia had been greatly influenced by the fate which had befallen a Russian diplo matic or consular representative at Jedda and a Russian lady doctor there. It is believed*in Riyadh that these two Russians were 'put out of the way' on their return to their couiit.ijf wixoy did not hold advanced communist views. 4. Dr. Storm said that Bashir Syed Alawi is the closest to the King of his counsellors and has most influence with\M) M Him. ^eu has strong feelings about the intervention of foreigners in Saudi Arabian affairs. Though he considers all foreign influence evil he thinks the British are less to be distrusted than other foreigners. 5. .Or. Storm was amazed at the way in which the King, in spite of his advanced age, still retains all power exclusively in his own hands and delegates no authority to any one - not even to the Crown Prince. Not only does he listen avidly to news collected from the radio broad casts of foreign stations but he takes a personal interest in the smallest item of news from any part of his own expensive tsj.-ji.'xooi'j.ttti* Or. atom told me that Ibn Saud gave him Rs 1500 as a fee for the medical services he had rendered. Dr. Storm received also Bs 500 from the Amir Saud and about Rs 1000 from private patients, Sd/- S. B.

Annual Summary of Events in Saudi Arabia during 1942. IBN SAUD'S despotic yet kindly hand has guided his country through yet another year. Time treats the King gently. His mind remains keen, his states manship is unimpaired and his warm humanity grows greater with the passing years. He continues to wield absolute control over his people and country. 2. Throughout 1942 the King continued' his unfaltering support of His Majesty's Government and the Allied cause. It is true that he refused to declare war on the Axis when sounded on this point by His Majesty's Minister at Riyadh in February, but his refusal arose from his conviction that both the interests of his country and of His Majesty's Government were best served by his remaining neutral. He argued that his influence in the Arab and Moslem world, and there fore his utility to His Majesty's Government, could not but be diminished! were he openly to take sides with us. If he declared war, people would say he had lost his independence and had become just a puppet in His Majbsty's Govern ment's hands. He also felt that, as guardian of the holy places of Islam, he could not expose the Holy Land to the risks and! horrors of war. His Majesty's Government saw the force of these arguments and did not press the matter further. 3. Ibn Saud's decision appears, so far, to have been the right one. His influence in the Arab lands beyond his frontiers is as great as ever (and, indeed, greater since our victories in North Africa have vindicated his policy), and that influence has consistently been used on our behalf. He has repeatedly advised Arab leaders, particularly in Syria, not to embarrass His Majesty's Government when they have their hands full elsewhere, and he is always telling them that only by British advice and assistance can the Arabs hope for liberty and a decent life in future. 4. In many other ways Ibn Saud's loyalty to His Majesty's Government has been manifest throughout the year. He has frequently communicated to us information regarding the situation in Europe and elsewhere obtained from his agents abroad; he has given us two machines of his tiny air force in the hope that they would be useful for carrying passengers and mails; in the summer when the position was most critical in Egypt he ungrudgingly allowed the Middle Ea^t Command to take over without payment seventy-five cars and lorries for which he had paid and which he required most urgently himself; he has agreed to British and American aircraft crossing Saudi Arabia from the Middle East to the Persian Gulf provided they keep clear of the Hejaz and its holy places and of the more thickly populated parts of Nejd; his sorrow at our defeat in Libya in the summer was only equalled by his joy at our subsequent victories; and, finally, he has taken no important move without consulting His Majesty's Government at every point. Indeed, Britain in all her long history can seldom have had such loyal support from a foreign Power either in adversity or in success. [39—16]/ v 2 5. There is, of course, another side to the picture. Ibn Saud continues to receive enormous benefits from his Majesty's Government, and! it is doubtful whether, without our help, his ramshackle kingdom could have withstood the results of the disintegnating forces released by the war. A country inhabited for the most part by wandering tribes of ignorant and fanatical Bedouin; a country with no financial reserves, with little agriculture, without exports, industries or shipping; a country hampered to a large extent by traditional ways of life and religion from adapting itself to the exigencies of a modern world at war; such a country can only weather the storm if taken in tow by a Power much greater than itself. That Power has been, and could only have been, Britain. His Majesty's Government, who carry so many other burdens, shouldered the burden of Saudi Arabia in 1941, and their help since then has been expressed in the only two things which matter at present; money and food. 6. Our subsidy to Saudi Arabia in 1942 reached the figure of approximately £3 million, part of which took the form of minting Saudi Arabian riyals in an attempt to solve the perennial problem of currency shortage, and part of which was expressed in supplies of food, &amp;c. With this help Ibn Saud was able to keep the country going, though at a reduced tempo; official salaries were paid (more or less), tribesmen, reduced to misery by prolonged drought, were assisted and merchants purchased food and other goods from abroad. The currency situation, however, is endlessly and, often fantastically, complicated. Riyals pour into the country and then disappear. Some find their way to Bahrein, Koweit and even Iraq, but it is clear that every riyal not needed to'purchase immediate necessities is buried or otherwise hoarded. There is therefore always a cry for more and more riyals to pay the salaries of Government employees and to keep ordinary commercial and financial transactions going. In an attempt to solve these financial problems, Sir F. Rugman, Financial Secretary in the Sudan Government, visited Jedda twice during the year. He and His Majesty's Minister (had lengthy, exhaustive and exhausting discussions with Ibn Saud's advisers, none of whom have, naturally, any conception of modern financial methods. Suggestion after suggestion was turned down on grounds of religion or policy. Indian silver rupees cannot be used concurrently with riyals because of the Prophet Mohammed's injunction that objects of the same substance may not be exchanged unless they have the same intrinsic value. Maria Theresa dollars are unacceptable or reasons of policy. A note issue meets with all sorts of difficulties, but it is to be hoped they will not prove insuperable, as this seems to be the onlv permanent solution. J r ., 7 - T ^ e solution of financial and currency difficulties is. of course, not enough m itself Even if there is money to pay for them, food and other supplies have to be found and transported, and it is due entirely to the generous and unceasing efforts of the Government of India and the Middle East Supply Centre and to the co-operation of British authorities in the Persian Gulf that a sufficiency of supplies reached Saudi Arabia during 1942. At the end of the year the outlook was darkened by the prospect that India, needing all her stocks for her own enormous population, would be unable to continue supplying this country. It is fn f^ 1 «n C( S SeqU 4 n M-^ t 1 T? 43 ^ l11 b&lt; ; the worst y ear ' hat Saudi Arabia has had Liejit rv^lonpl AP Su PP 1 y Centre representative, in the person of w!

The Italian and German internees are still in Jedda, though a party of Italian civilians, at their own request, were allowed to leave in small boats in Wal July. Most of them were picked up by the Royal Navy, but some reached the Yemen and a few eventually returned to Jedda, where they were again interned. Ws,| The Turkish Government has undertaken to arrange an exchange of Italian internees at Jedda for an equal number of British seamen in Italian hands. His Majesty's Government have agreed, but no reply had been received from Italy ^gifr by the end of the year. 1 Hi 8 1 12. Ibn Baud's recognition of the independence of Syria at the end of 1941 1)1% raised a protest from the Iraqi Government early in 1942. The Iraqis considered lemiW that Ibn Saud should have consulted them before taking such a step, but Ibn Saud replied that he was merely following the lead given by. His Majesty's Government ofa^ and that, consequently, there was no need for such consultation. Relations with ia/Jj] Iraq were also slightly troubled by the holding up on the Iraq frontier of a Saudi mi J 1 ! Arabian diplomatic bag. Ibn Saud was angry at what he considered to be a fUL 1 personal affront, but he was eventually appeased by a letter of apology. 1 o a i -pr&gt;w-r» f rwovi o 'n /^'p rl 1 'tvl rvtyl o f m ati f £1 f.l '\7^ 13. A proposal for the exchange of diplomatic representatives between Syria and Saudi Arabia had produced no tangible result by the end of the year. 14. The three agreements with Koweit (Treaty of Friendship, Extradition Treaty and Trade Agreement) were signed on the 20th April. Ratifications had W 11 not been exchanged by the end of the year, but as both parties have been carrying f eit: out the terms of the agreements for some years past, this does not matter much. 15. The B.O.A.C. started an air service between Jedda, Port Sudan, Asmara | t !Tl and Egypt in May and this has been most useful. 16. The 1942 pilgrimage, which came at the end of the year, was much more jpttoi successful than could have been expected. Egyptians, enriched no doubt by the MkOp hugg s nm a spent in Egypt by the British forces, came in much larger numbers 'mkikk than usual, the total being in the region of 13,000. There were also about 5,000 leruKii Palestinians, Transjordanians and Syrians, and some pilgrims came from Iraq and % Persia. There were also about 7,000 Sudanese and West Africans. The Govern- icy, life ment of India decided that, in view of the danger to pilgrim ships from Axis sub- s of if marines in the Indian Ocean, the Indian pilgrimage should be cancelled. Axis potfesii: propaganda would no doubt have made great use of this, but Ibn Saud cut the arsawt ground from under their feet by stating, and by allowing the B.B.C. to broadcast tfciilfet his opinion, that the Government of India had acted rightly. The King followed tbb- this up at the annual banquet given to prominent pilgrims in Mecca by an energetic speech, in which His Majesty's Government came in for a great deal of f C(M i praise for their unceasing care and consideration for Moslem pilgrims. Reports ; er „ fe i which are beginning to come in show that this speech had a very beneficial effect 0[iS 4 on the audience and on others to whom the King's words have by now been ./w carried. 17. Lord Moyne, the Acting Minister of State in Cairo, visited Jedda at the a . | : end of December and was given several audiences by the King. 18. His Majesty's Minister left Jedda, on temporary transfer to Morocco, on the 15th December. ,ocksk ; 19.

On my return here I was sorry to find that the telegram T had asked Miniform, Cairo, to send had been mutilated in transit. The form which I used was 'Following for Colonel Prior'; another omission was the word 'dagger 1 following the word 'gold 1 , 3. I had three very cordial conversations with Ibn Sa'ud who talked to me freely and frankly about a great many subjects. He gave me the whole story of the part he had played at the time of Rashid Ali's rebellion, of the flying visit to him of Naji As Suwaidi which was most interesting. He also expressed his views on the Palestine question, I got the impression that he thinks in terms of qua-Moslem rather than qua-Arab conceptions of politics. He said that the greatest page in our history was written in the year during this war when we stood alone. He is a convinced believer in our star and in our destiny to shape the post-war world. I came away from Sa^di Arabia rich in presents as does everybody, British and American alike, who visits the King. I received a sword at the outset of my trip from the Amir of A1 Khobar, In Riyadh I was given a gold dagger and some gold bangles for my scattered family in Africa and America, I also received in Cairo a very nice personal telegram signed 'Abdul Aziz 1 which was sent on via Jedda. 4. The principal officers of Ibn Sa'ud's State are as follows: THE AMIR SA'UD Two Ministers; THE AMIR FAISAL Heir Apparent, Foreign Minister &amp; Viceroy of the Hijaz SHAIKH ABDULLAH IBN SULAIMAN (Nejdi) Finance Minister. Advisers in Riyadh: BASHIR BEY AS SA'ADAWI (Tunisian) A1 Mustashar, SHAIKH ABDUL RAHMAN AL TUBAISHI (Ifejdi) Chief Chamberlain, KHALID BEY ABUL WALID (Libyan) Court official at Riyadh. m'ble Lieut,-Col, C, G, Prior, C,I,E,, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSH IRE. / Secrdarv- 2 - Secretary at Bedai'a; RUSHDI MILHAS (Syrian) Four Doctors in Riyadh^ notably: DR. BASHIR ) ) DR. MIDHA.T SHAIKH AL ARDH) All Syriana DR. AHMAD AL YASIN ) Advisers in Jedda: YUSIF BEY AL YASIN ) ) Syrians. NAJIB AS SALIH ) Qaim Maqam of Jedda; IBRAHIM IBN MUHAMMAD AL MU 1 AMMAR fejdt) Governor of Jedda who is brotherin-law of Shaikh Abdulla Ibn Fadhul, Ibn Sard's Agent in Bahrain. Shaikh Abdulla Ibn Sulaiman is the most capable Arabian in the King f s service and has the rank of Minister. There are only two Ministers, the other being the King's second son, the Amir Faisal. Shaikh Abdulla who is a Nejdi is the right-hand man of Ibn Sa^d in the develop ment of the country. He was at KharJ during my visit to Riyadh and is said to spend most of his time there, as Kharj is his pet scheme (see separate note on food supplies). He was described to me as the dynamo of Sa f udi Arabian development. Shaikh Abdul Rahman al Tubaishi is not a Minister but is a Chamberlain of considerable acumen who is known to be a King*s favorite. The King listens to him. He is probably theymkt influential Nejdi about the King. I found him amiable. These two men are the most outstanding Arabians in the King's service if they are not the only ones occupying high offices. The Nejdis/have very little /in general knowledge of the outside world and so the King has about him many Syrian and N. African Advisers, as these - the former particularly - alone are able to help him in the more complicated details of the external aspects of currency and supply questions - are able to speak European languages, and deal with Europeans over concessions and the like. Among the first of these is Yusuf Bey Al Yasin, a very powerful man in Sa'udi Arabia on whom the King largely relies for liaison work with foreign Legations, etc. at Jedda. He is a Syrian from Latakia and an ardent Syrian nationalist. He was a school master in Palestine at the time of the last war when, as he told me, he was imprisoned by us, i.e., by Ronald Storrs, then Governor of Jerusalem, and he spent a year or two in exile in Egypt. No ill-will remains as he gave a dinner party for me in Jedda to which all Charges d'affaires /camecame except the Vichy French Representative, and he, I understand, has recently been given his conge. The next most important Syrian is Najib as Salih who is the King^ Representative in his dealings with C.A.S.O.C. and S.A.M.S. He is I should think from his appearance a Druze. He is also an ardent Syrian nationalist. A very astute man who was a shipping clerk in the Red Sea ten years ago, he now holds a position of great responsibility with the King. He is reputed to have acquired considerable wealth. The King has to rely a great deal on these two Syrian Advisers in his dealings with foreign representatives and concessionaires, so they are both stationed at Jedda. Two very high-ranking advisers are Bashir Sa f adawi and Khalid Abul Walid, the former of Tunisian, the latter of Libyan origin,both refugees from the Italians many years ago. Today they are members of the King's Court at Riyadh and occupy important places at his daily evening Majlis when the King listens to a resume of foreign broadcasts and discusses current questions of his State. Both Bashir and Khalid are old and implacable enemies of the Italians who put a price on one or both of their heads. Bashir went to Palestine where he was Editor of an Arab newspaper, prominent at the time of the last troubles in that country. He came to Sa'udi Arabia originally to enlist the King^ sympathies on the Arab side against the Zionists. The King liked him and appointed him as the Mustashar. A most influential man. I talked to a Beyrout graduate at Riyadh who is one of the three radio monitors in the King^ service. They take down fourteen stations each day. Allied and Axis, The transcriptions are reproduced for the King's evening Majlis. The King likes the B.B.C. news, Arabic and English, most of all, and he also had some praise for our Bahrain station which can be heard very clearly in the Nejd and which is quite popular there. The King is, of course, an absolute Ruler and does not pay attention to any of his own advisers where the advice conflicts with the still small voice within him which has been so invariably right. He refers practically everything of external significance to H.B.M. ! s Minister, before acting. The Amir Sa'ud who unfortunately was away hunting during my trip to Riyadh is reputed to be popular in the Nejd but is given very little rope by his father because his father holds all the ropes in his own hands. The King introduced me to two other of his principal sons, one of them Mansur who was a guest of the Egyptian Govern ment last year. Mansur's mother is said to have been a Circassian jariya*(?) brought as a child from Syria during the last war and given as a present to the King. Mansur is the most progressive of the King's thirty-eight sons with a strong bent for machinery and a reputation for being able to repair his car when broken down on the road with his own hands. He is in charge of the Palace electric light system. The Amir Faisal, as Viceroy in the Hijaz, lives most of his time at Medina or Taif. Nominally he is Foreign Minister, but he is generally short-circuited by the King who gets into contact with the various Charges d'affaires using /YusifBey Yasin as his intermediary. Faisal is the most sophisticated of Ibn Sa'ud^ sons, takes a keen interest in all the battle fronts and can talk volubly about them. His outlook is less narrow than the Nejdis 1 , his manner of life more like that of the Hijazis, and he appears to have built up a position for himself in the Hijaz. The influential families in the Hijaz who used to get pick ings from the pilgrim traffic have, in principle,resented Nejdi domination but are well disposed to the Amir Faisal, The pilgrim traffic revenues have sensibly diminished on account of the war, but the subsidy now given by H.B.M.'s Government enables the King to offset the Hijaz^ loss. The subsidy greatly exceeds of course the royalties now given by American gold and oil concessionaires and Ibn Sa'ud's financial position is probably stronger today than it has ever been. He is using the gold, the coins and the supplies which he is receiving from us to keep the hungry desert in check and is well maintaining his regime. His own life is an austere one and he is known to give away all that he gets, and as this is so consider able he continues to be an object of veneration throughout the whole of his country. In Riyadh I saw hundreds of men and women drawn up outside the city walls receiving the King's bounty. The Paymaster who is the head of the City Police came along on a motor-bicycle carrying bags of coins. He dismounted and walked along the ranks of those assembled, placing a coin or two into the hand of each person. This is a daily feature in the life of Riyadh. Similarly any tribes in want are the object of the King's benevolence. There is quite a considerable Government motor transport system in Riyadh and this is used to take supplies to the areas where they are most needed. Three out of every four toapks and lorries met on the road - and we passed^dozen^ each day - were painted red, the sign that they were Government vehicles. An M.E.S.C. Officer, Major Roberts, is Technical Adviser to the Sa'udi Government in Jedda and has a workshop there. He was a fellow passenger of mine on the way to Cairo where he was going on a hunt for 'spare parts 1 . Transport is a department under Najib As Salih. 5.

WADI HAMA ' JEDDA 120 Four nights at Jedda, 26th to 29th March; then left by ship for Suez as there was no plane for 12 days. The air service to Cairo is a fortnightly one and would have entailed delay. Arabia in this latitude is an uptilted plateau rising imperceptibly from sea level at Dhahran to 3,700 feet on the RUKBA, the roof of the Hijaz Mountains. From there the descait in the last 150 kilometres of the journey to Jedda is through the black forbidding mountains of the Hijaz. 6. In Cairo I was occupied with many departments of Miniform over outstanding propaganda routine matters, cinema, etc., etc. I also wrote a note on a Middle East project about which I would like to speak to you sometime, and my visit there permitted of my attending the dentist. 7. A high-ranking official, originally Treasury, one Mr.Curtis Ryan, has been appointed to direct Miniform activities in the Middle East and occupy the position that Sir Walter Monckton vacated. On his arrival a conference of all Publicity Officers (including myself) is to be summoned at Cairo to meet him. When he arrives and the date of the conference is settled and communicated to me I shall wire you and be grateful for your approval to make the flying visit. This, I gathered, would be in the second or third week of May. On my return to Basrah I should very much like to come on to Bushire to see you, if this is convenient for you. If it is possible for me to arrange air or launch transport from Basrah to Bushire, I hope that this will have your approval./ OOglDlfllTlAl..

Ibn Saud wishes to send his sons Mansr and Mohamed to India for reasons of health together with his Minister of Finance (Abdullah Suliman) who has been seriously ill and who must travel urgently to India possibly for an operation and in any case for a rest and recuperation in a good climate. His Majesty has decided upon India as being less likely to cause gossip and speculation than, Syria or any other Middle East country. 2. Ibn Saud has asked me to arrange for above-mentioned to travel by air from Bahrain to India accompanied by doctor and four servants (eight persons in all) and he asks that matter be treated as urgent. 3. Can you arrange for BOAC to provide accomodation for this party in near future ? Alternatively I suggest Royal Air Force might like to provide transport in consideration for the many occasions on which their personnel have received help from Saudi Arabian authorities after forced landings in Saudi territory along Persian Gulf. Such a gesture would certainly be very pleasing to Ibn Saud and would be good propaganda for us in this country. Effect of this would be increased if aircraft could fly to Rosat Khreima or instead such place near Riyadh to embark passengers. 4.

Shere were also present His Royal Highness Abdullah 'bin Abdur Rahman and His Royal Highness Ajnir Saud, iVbdallali al Suleiiaan, Khalid Bey al Garganey and B a shir Bey al Sa'adawy. His Majesty opened the conversation by mentioning the supply situation in the country# His Majesty drew the General's attention particularly to the deterioration of the situation with regard to supplies in the territories adjacent to the Persian Gulf, saying, 'Perhaps the officials of the Coapajny at Dhahran have told you something about this, * Then His Majesty spoke of the silver coinagp csdsis and explained the fundamental factors that make it necessary to have gold and silver coinage in this country to the exclusion of other currencies - especially paper# His Majesty said that Britain had not got the necessary silvery indeed it had been announced in a broadcast that Britain had had to obtain a quantity of silver from America. n In view of the friendship between us and our Allies, 11 said His Majesty, 'a friendship that rests on a basis of truthfulness and frankness, - we should like to tell the General that we need help in i n *1. Supplies, especially for the territories on the Persian Gulf»* *2* Oomraunications. The United States of America sent us 80 lorries but we loaded these lorries with supplies for Al Jauf and they broke down on the way and were unable to do the job. They are now immobilised and unserviceable owing to lack of the necessary spare parts# We are in most pressing need of cars and spare parts# The representative knows veiy well the vast extent of our country and its need of transport to assure the security of the frontiers, internal security and the transport of supplies to the various quarters# ' 3»/3. Currency* His Majesty said that in view of the country * s embarrassment due to lack of silver currency and to Britain's f not having enou^i silver, he hoped that the United States would let Saudi Arabia have a quantity of silver under Xiease Lend which could then be sent to India for minting, as owing to the present war Saudi Arabia had begun minting its coins in India. Here General Hurley saidj 'The United States of America always send their products and the things the Allies need to Britain and Britain distributes them herself to the Allies. The value of material so far sent to Britain amounts to about six milliards of pounds. I rayself have suggested to Government that they should themselves undertake the distribution of this material to the Allied countries. ** His Majesty salds 'We are not oaaplaining about Britain. She is our friend, and her treatment of us is as friend to friend, not as ally to ally. She has not stinted, but the developments of the war in the Middle Bast reoently and her own need of transport and supplies has obliged her to take certain measures. The truth is that Britain has done her duty and more than her duty but n oircumstanoe s will not shape themselves aooording to our desire' and silver is one of those circumstances. Britain has found it impoasible to let us have the riyals we need because she has not got the silver. It is perfectly true that she has no silver and the proof is that She has had to borrow silver from the United States.' ^ • 4. His Majesty then saidi w Owing to the vast extent of our country and the long distances that the post has to cover wp obliged to make general use of Wireless Stations in various parts of the country. We have so far established about fifty stations or more but we still need another ten apparatuses. This is essential equipment on which depends the security of .the country and we hope that our Ally America will give us these apparatuses.' , His Majesty closed his observations by speaking of his friend- whip for the United States of America which had grown out of mmieroua links, especially economic ones, binding the two countries together. His Majesty mentioned in particular, the Oil OoB^any at Dhahran. In the evening the Representative and his cccrpanions dined with His Majesty.

Ibn Soleiraam M Fifty million riyals, including rayals, half- riyals and quarters. ^ i Cars, spare parts and wireless apparatus were then discussed# General Hurley asked how mai^r oars were needed# He was told that there was great need of cars# Mldale East Supply Centre had decided to send eighty lorries last year but it was not until twenty days ago that they senc them. They came overland via Ma 1 an and have not yet arrived fiere, Some of them broke down on the way ana they had no spare parts with them, althouji spares were flown to them by air (?).

General Hurley then asked about food supplies. Ibn Suleiman described the state of the country and the need for foodstuTfs.

This was accomplished and arrangements made for the transmission of the synoptic reports by r /*r to Basra from whence they were telegraphed to Baghdad. This arrangement operated until etsiy 1943, when it was considered necessary, not only to undertake the establishment of three more reporting stations but also, in view of the fact that the Dbservations from Hail and Riyadh were invariably 2-3 days late, to come to some arrangement whereby the Meteorological Office at Habbaniya received these reports in time to be of real use. In March of this year the following proposals were placed, by the minister of State in Cairo, before H.M.King Abdul \ziz ibn 3aud. I. That permission be granted for the establishment of meteorological stations at Sakaka, Lina and Buraida. S. That a British party, led by an officer of the R, A .F. ,be allowed to enter his country for the above purpose. 5. That Saudi irabian officials be allowed to make the observations after training by the visiting party* U That a daily broadcast of the synoptic messages of all stations, by the Riyadh T/T station, replace the existing arrangement of transmission through Basra. &gt;• That a Saudi Arabian official be sent to Baghdad for a period of three months* training in meteorology. Permission with regard to proposals 1, 2 &amp; 3 was readily granted.. To reply regarding proposals 4^5 was received but instructions were &gt;iven to the officer in charge of the party, to endeavour to arrange ;he broadcast whilst in Riyadh and also ascertain the official attitude towards the proposed training of the Saudi vrabian official. The party left Baghdad arport on October 7th and, in the course two months, covered a distance of approximately 3000 miles over the rollowing rout® Baghdad - Rutba - Mafraq - i .mman - Hakk-kaf - Sakaka - Duwaid - Langa - Una - Hail - Buraida - Riyadh - ariva - Shaibah - Baghdad. Meteorological stations were successfully established at Sakaka, Lina and Buraida and the local t 7/T operators trained in making the Dbservations, translating them into the International Meteorological 3ode, and transmitting them to Riyadh. The stations at Hail and Riyadh were inspected and their inventories checked. V/hilst in Riyadh, the officer in charge of the party was successful in arranging for two broadcasts per day of the synoptic messages of all five stations and remained a sufficient length of time to verify their successful reception by the '7/t section of the meteorological Office at Habbaniya. Instead of having to wait 2-3 ctays before receiving tv/o synoptic messages from 3audia \rabia the eteorological Office at Habbaniya now receives five, one hour'after each observation. Tentative agreement was also reached with H H the ^rown Prince Saud, in the absence of the Kins? in Mecca, on the' question of training a Saudi irabian official in Baghdad. The success of the tour was only made possible by the kindness and active assistance rendered us, on the direct orders of H.n.the Kinr oy all with whom we came in contact. vmple evidence of the livelv interest in our work, displayed by the King, was afforded us throughout the tour. From the time v/hen we made contact with the Saudi irabian agent Vmman to our arrival in Kuwait, H.M.the King was kept continuously /Overinformed of our movements and in every case preceded our arrival each new destination by a personal signal, to the Local Smir, re our work and comfort. During the negotiations preceding the ins of the daily broadcasts, the King not only proved himself anxlou--^ help in every way but also showed considerable concern that thes^^ broadcasts be handled successfully.

I HAVE the honour to transmit the accompanying record of the conversa- '/it, tions which took place recently at Riyadh between Ibn Saud and Colonel Hoskins. This document, which was communicated to me by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on Ibn Saud's instructions, is in the form of a letter from the King to the sheikh. That part of the discussions which turned on Palestine and Arab unity has already been reported to you separately in my telegrams Nos. 345 and 349 and in my despatch No. 66 of the 31st August, 1943. \lil\l ^ am se . n( iing copies of this despatch and its enclosure to the Minister of State at Cairo, to His Majesty's representatives at Cairo, Bagdad and Beirut, tluj^nd to the High Commissioner for Palestine.

INFORM Mr. Wikeley that Colonel Hoskins, President Roosevelt's repre sentative, came to see us. We talked with him, and he left on Saturday for Dhahran on his way to Egypt. He talked at great length, questioned us exhaustively and sought our opinion. We gave him the necessary reply. He is :he bearer of a letter from President Roosevelt authorising him to discuss certain natters with us on the President's behalf; at the same time he bears a verbal nessage regarding the Palestine question. We have sent you, as enclosures, the following documents — 1. President Roosevelt's letter. 2. President Roosevelt's verbal message. 3. Our reply to the President's letter. 4. Our reply to the verbal message regarding Palestine. 5. Copy of our discussion about Arab unity. In view of the length of these documents and the difficulty of telegraphing their contents, we have sent them to you to-day, and, God willing, you will show them to him. As regards the Palestine question, we gave a verbal reply to the verbal message, and you will find a copy thereof enclosed herein. In addition, he asked us whether or not there would be a revolt in Palestine, whether we had heard that the Jews had formed a secret army with soldiers, and whether the Arabs had * made any preparations or arrangements. We replied that we had heard nothing ibout the Jewish formations he mentioned except that Britain had asked the Jews for soldiers, whereupon we had asked the British Government about it, and :hey had replied that what they had asked for were not soldiers for fighting, but men to take the place of British soldiers who had been sent to the front so that :hey could replace them inside the country in order to ensure internal security. As regards the Arabs in Palestine, we told him that we could not give any guarantee regarding the conduct of the Arabs in Palestine or elsewhere, for the Arabs were all agreed that the Jews in Palestine were buying arms and munitions and making military arrangements and warlike preparations; we, however, did not pay attention to such talk, but this is what we had heard. He stated that he tiad also heard the same thing and would like to confirm it, to which we replied that the Arabs of Palestine were afraid of this rumour and of the preparations [45—62]of the Jews which they saw around them; we were confident, however, that nothing would happen so long as Britain was in Palestine; true, the Arabs of Palestine greatly resented this state of affairs, but we would not spare any effort with the Allies to allay the fears of the Arabs, and we hoped that the war would end with the victory of the Allies, for such a victory was profitable to the Arabs. As regards talk about a revolt by the Arabs in Palestine, we had heard nothing, and if we did hear and confirm it we would be against it. The other questions he asked us about were numerous and are set out as under 1. He asked us about our relations with Egypt, and we informed him that they were excellent and the best possible. 2. He asked us about the Caliphate, and we explained to him that this question had arisen thirty-five years ago, and that its past history was known- we then explained to him that there were obligations and conditions attaching to the Caliphate which he who laid claim to it had to fulfil. There are three things which he who claims to be Caliph must be distinguised by and which he must fulfil; these three are :—■ {a) That he rules his people and his country and the countries under his rule in accordance with the Book of God and the teaching of the Prophet. (&amp;) That he takes charge of the Caliphate with the agreement of all Moslems and makes ' jihad ' (holy war) for it with the sword. (c) That he has power and strength to protect his country and people from any enemies, fights for them and makes the ' iihad ' in the cause of God. Then the President's representative asked what we meant by 'jihad,' and we told him that it meant that the Caliph had power to prevent him {i.e. Colonel Hoskins) from coming to his country by land and sea, at which he laughed, and asked whether that was possible; to which we replied that only he who possessed such power could seek to be Caliph, for without it there would be no Caliphate. He then asked our opinion as to who should lay claim to the Caliphate,, and we told him that it was at present a hollow, meaningless title (literally ' a loud voice with an empty belly '). He then asked our opinion about India, what news we had about it and what the aims of the Indians were, complete independence and separation or not We replied that this was impossible; firstly, it is not in the interests of the Indians, ^ and, secondly, it is not in the interests of Britain; if India obtains her kUk independence this will be harmful to Indian Moslems in the first place, for the ; I Hindus will rise up and slaughter them. In our opinion Hindus and Japanese ' ' are both alike and both are heathens. He asked us what Indian Moslems say about this, and we told him that we had told them what was in their interests, namely, that their interests demanded agreement with Britain; if they abandoned this agreement it would mean the beginning of their annihilation; moreover, even supposing Britain were to leave India, any Government that was powerful enough could attack India and conquer it without scruple. He asked us next about Persia and we told him that in the age of the 'Khafar ' regime Persia was degenerate and ruined; things changed with the advent to power of Pahlevi Shah, the Government became organised, and the Shah, who had power and influence, oppressed the Arabs; then things grew confused and bad owing to his regime as they were in the bad old days; he asked us ; c ' And now? '—to which we replied that the situation to-day was stable and that the son who reigned in his father's stead was popular; it was, moreover, in ,, r •the interests of Persia that the Allies occupied it; and if after the war the Allies gave the Persians full independence, that would be in their own interests and provide Persia with an opportunity to desist from evil and do good; one matter, however, we are not happy about in Persia; he asked : ' What is that and we replied : The question of the Russians ''; we do not like the Russians to have an entry into Persia or into the Near East, but in view of war-time conditions and exigencies the Arabs can but be patient; no doubt the Allies think of removing them and their mischief after the war. He asked me next what I thought about Russia's principles, and I replied that, as he was aware, these were all bad, the Russians deny this and say that it is false and an invention of English propaganda. We added that it is clear to us that what the Russians do ^ as patent as the sun, and travellers from the Caucasus have told us more. Khalid Abdul Walid, who is an eye-witness of this, has told us that they are anti-religious and amoral, but, if God wills, He will make them follow the Wit leslatd4 principles of the Allies. He states that 'we' (the Americans) &amp;re^'Tso busy % with Persia and have sent them technicians and experts, and our men are making [ hi a railway for them. He then asked me about the situation in Syria, and I answered ; ' Syria is I one of the finest Arab countries and her men are workers they, however, received no help in the past towards their independence, nor were their problems Jin solved until the Allies entered Syria two years ago and the King of Britain recognised their independence; we hope that this will be a good start. As regards y ^ e i r situation to-day, they are doing well, especially following on the elections, when men of the ' Kitlah ' (Nationalist bloc) took over the Government; these [oil men are the best available, upright and with principles. I wish them luck from start to finish. ioit then asked me for my views on the Syrians and Lebanese and the question ; J -Lebanon s independence, and I replied : ' The views of us Arabs and of df w ^ 0 ^ e world are that the fusion of Syria and the Lebanon is the best and most suitable solution whether from the economic or the political point of view; this is what the people talk about and what we desire.' From what we gather from i% Syrians who visit us, there is no difference between Syria and the Lebanon, nor etaji have we heard that there is any enmity or hostility between them. This is what I know. He asked us what our own situation was as regards civilisation development oil an( ^ education, and what conditions the Arab States wanted and what our opinion jailn about it was? I replied : '.There are two points to this question : the first is the rf question of religion, the traditions of the Arabs, and the religious precepts of the Moslems, matters we cannot possibly allow to be interfered with, however, small they were and even if they were as a grain of mustard; even if I. for example con- ffltl sidered it negligible, the people of Nejd would rise against me in the same way as m they would never allow it themselves ; as regards the second point, such pursuits as mi agriculture which provide an abundant livelihood and do not affect religious ■fitit matters, these we encourage and desire/' He told me that '' we are prepared to itilfe give all assistance in such matters, but I must explain that the technicians and Uii experts we send will be paid for by the Government which employs them. ,; Next « he asked us about roads and why we had not built them, to which I replied : ' We have this in mind, and asked Mr. Twitchell, the engineer, to discuss it with the iM American Government and with certain firms; the war intervened, however, and fflti we broke off discussions because without machinery and tools there can be no rtrfl roads.' He stated that he knew that there were certain machines in Egypt which lil could be used for road-levelling; I told him : ' If you find them we should like itaft, them.' He then asked us about the pilgrimage and what 1 thought about it I ii': replied : ' God willing the ' Hajj ' will be considerable this year, for no doubt isiillff Moslems wish to perform their duty; unfortunately the pilgrims may not be able {iw to obtain their desired comfort because of the lack of cars on the one hand and ii;!- the lack of tlle necessary spare parts on the other, for last year and the year fas g before we were obliged to give our own cars to transport the pilgrims, so that all we have now is what we obtained from you the last time, which is insufficient; j| Slmila rly, the cars which arrived recently' need repairs and we do not have the dfi necessary spare parts. Indeed, the Car Company here is in great difficulties and Ug cannot ev en ensure the transport of the mail; I therefore consider that with n your agreement and approval you might give us 200 or 300 cars for the pilgrimage iU ; to 'e provided either by you or by one of your firms to the above-mentioned ■ , company as happened before.' 'That is all very well,' he answered, 'but ^ uniortunately the only cars we have are those which are being used on the battle it. fronts. We retorted : 'The small number we require will not affect you as it ^ is but a drop m the ocean, which benefits us without harming vou.' ' I will sueak [P P: about it ' he said. F 0 l/ T^f tllen asked me : ' J 011 wish to charge me with any service^ ' and I [ m ^ pll ? d : ' 1 have nothing, but in any case you know the channels of communica- # tion between us. There are three matters, however, which I would like to tell ff# you about: firstly, every effort should be made not to cut down the amounts of p supplies agreed upon and their transportation; we know you are not neglecting iiiie tins; however, as regards the question of transport, some delay is inevitable, but you and your ally, Britain, can do what is necessary to remove the obstacles which ea5( i; prevent the arrival of supplies in time. Secondly, the question of silver currencv: when the pilgrimage takes place and no silver is available the people will be K , He r „ p1 ^ : ' 1 kn(&gt;w about this and 80 does my Government j0S il and I will do my best. Finally,' I told him, &lt;c we need cars and hope that you &gt; p' ^ J4 will not stint us in this matter and in the matter of sending sufficient spare parts.' Then he asked us about Iraq and relations between us. We answered that ' there exist no important differences between us and we are as close together as possible; there are a few insignificant matters outstanding between us, but we have not importuned the Iraqis about them. God willing, these will be solved after the war.' He then questioned us about the attitude of Nuri-as-Said and the Regent, and we said to him : 'We know no more about this than you; I hear about it, but your representatives in Iraq can tell you about it; I have no more to say to you on this matter.' Next he asked us about our opinion regarding Morocco, and I told him that it was clear from what Moroccans coming to the Hejaz said that the people there did not want French rule; that was all I knew about it. Then he asked us about our relations with the Turks, and we told him that they were now excellent and that although there had been ancient enmity between us because of their destruction of our country in past wars, we were now pleased with them in the present war and wished them good luck; although they derived strength out of their attitude, yet it had been beneficial to the Allies. We were therefore exceedingly pleased with them. These, then, are the topics he discussed with us. Indeed, he asked about everything and we do not know whether this was on his own initiative or whether he was instructed to do so, except that he told us that President Roosevelt likes to have information and asked him to enquire about* everything. This is what we have got, tell the ' Britisher ' about it, as usual, and let us know the result. Letter from President Roosevelt to His Majesty King Ibn Saud.

You should therefore, if you see no objection, reply to Ibn Saud on the following lines. 2. His Majesty's Government are aware that hitherto Ibn •Saud has not been prepared to agree to consular representation at any place in his territories except Jedda and that until recently there have been no foreign interests in other parts of Saudi .irabia which would justify establishment of consular posts. But now an immense industry is growing up at Dhahran which will employ increasing numbers of U.S .A. citizens and it is reasonable that U.S»A. Government should wish to provide consular facilities for them. His Majesty*s Government feel in the circumstances continued refusal of American request would only be a source of natural irritation to U.S. x. Government and they would therefore suggest Ibn Saud would be well advised to agree to it. They consider Ibn Saud need have no fear that appointment of an iiinerican Consul to Dhahran would, be lilcely to be taken as a precedent and lead to corresponding requests for consular representation at Dhahran by other powers since no other country has commercial interests comparable with those of U.S.A. in Eastern Saudi Arabia.

Diplomatic missions often cover more than one territory hut I do not recall similar instances of consular J urisdicti on. i 3. In our discussions with Persia we have rigidly refrained from making public examination and discussion of our position in the Islands. If proposed appointment is formally recognised we may sooner or later have to face such examination and discussion if requests for similar facilities for their Consuls at jedda or elsewhere are made by Iraq or Persia or any other power. An added complication in such an event would be that we would either have to admit that the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 is a dead letter or take a stard on this agreement and declare Bahrain a pro tectorate. 4, Taking all this into consideration I suggest that our best course would be to endeavour to avoid formally recognising the a urisidicti on of the U.S. Consul at Dhahran and allow him to enter Bahrain on the same footing as his colleagues at Baghdad or Basra. This should satisfyi ^ericans v/ho have 'been informed of our difficulties but in the last resort the King * a exequatur should suffice.

Sir, Foreign Office, §th December, 1943. ^ / IN the absence of the Secretary of State and the temporary indisposition of Mr. Law, His Royal Highness the Amir Feisai, accompanied by the Saudi Arabian Minister, called at the Foreign Office on the 30th November and saw Sir Maurice Peterson. 2. The Amir said that he had been instructed by his father to give us some account of his doings in the United States and of the present state of relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States. 3. On the question of supplies, the Amir explained that they had been disappointed. They had not been able to secure any further allocation of motor cars or lorries, although those already promised would be forthcoming. 4. On the question of arms the Saudi Arabian Government felt that they would require our assistance. Sir Maurice Peterson intervened to say that the previous uncertainty on this subject had been due to a difference of opinion between the State Department and the War Department in Washington. He thought the position was now cleared up and the Saudi Arabian Government might be assured that we should have cognisance of any orders for arms they might wish to place in the United States, or of any offers of arms they might receive from the United States Government, and that, provided these were within reasonable limits, we should give our support. 5. The Amir then turned to oil. He said that, as we knew, the Standard Oil Company of California had a concession in his country and they now wished to expand their operations and, in particular, to construct refineries. They had, however, found themselves unable to secure the necessary plant from their Government unless that Government itself were admitted into partnership with the company in the further development of oil installations in Saudi Arabia. The Amir did not know the precise degree of participation which the United States Government required, but the principle was clear. His father had made it plain that an undertaking must be given that there would be no interference in the administration of the country. But even so, His Majesty was not altogether happy and. wanted to make sure he had our approval and to secure our advice. 6. Sir Maurice Peterson said that we had no objection at all to ail expan sion of the United States concession with a view to further development whether by way of exploration or by the establishment of refineries. But he could under stand that the Saudi Arabian Government were a little uneasy at the direct intervention of the United States Government. He suggested, therefore, that they might think it well to insist that operations in Saudi Arabia should be carried on by a locally registered company, whatever the proportion of the shares which might be held in the background either by the United States Government or by private United States corporations. 7. The Amir took note of this suggestion. 8. His Royal Highness then said that he came to the most important point of all. His father was expecting to be invited within the next three or four months to participate in some form of Arab Congress in Cairo. Before he did so. His Majesty was very anxious to know our views so that he might conform his own attitude to them. 9. Sir Maurice Peterson said that our attitude towards Arab federation remained unchanged. We did not think it desirable to sponsor any particular scheme since, in our view, if federation were to succeed, it must be a spontaneous movement. But we were in no sense opposed. Nor, on the other hand, did we cherish any particular and favourite side-project of our own in connexion with federation, e.g., we had no candidate for the throne of Syria and thought that Syria might very probably in the end decide to get along without a throne. We had made it plain to the French that whatever their post-war position in Syria ,[48—27]and the Lebanon might be—and we thought they had to have some kind of special position—it was not to be allowed to interfere with Arab federation. Beyond this there was really nothing we could say, although our own feeling was that neither King Abdul Aziz nor Egypt had any intention of linking themselves with any federation which might result, and the most probable outcome would be some kind of loose customs and cultural union embracing Iraq, Syria, the Lebanon and Transjordan. Within these limits it was open to Ibn Saud to adopt any attitude he might wish, and we should not complain if His Majesty did so. Sir Maurice Peterson added that there was, of course, the obvious omission of Palestine, and that this must still be regarded as a closed subject on which we could not as yet offer any guidance, based on our own intentions, to His Majesty. 10. The Amir manifested some dissatisfaction with this reply. He asked that it should be realised that the Arab Conference in Cairo, when it met, would probably be composed largely of extremists. There would be many people there who would wish to go much further than might be prudent, and his father did not think it unfair to ask that, if he were to use his influence to restrain such people, he might be given guidance in advance as to the intentions and wishes of His Majesty's Government. 11. Sir Maurice Peterson said that possibly we should know where we stood better than we did at present before the Cairo Conference met. He must make it plain that there was no question of decisions having been taken on the subject of Palestine as yet. But he could say that two aspects of the situation were beginning to be increasingly felt in London, and these were, firstly, that it was not practicable to use Palestine as a dumping-ground for the whole of world Jewry, and, secondly, that under whatever conditions Jews might be enabled to settle and to live in parts of the world other than Palestine, the Jews ought to have a special position at least in some part of Palestine which would serve as a centre for the whole world structure of post-war Jewry. 12. The Amir gave it as his personal view that he hoped His Majesty's Government would not again have recourse to the partition solution. This had been found impracticable at the time and would be no more practicable now. The right course was to set up and maintain a Palestine Government which would be neither Arab nor Jewish, but would rule the whole country in the interests of both. I am, &amp;c. C. R.

American Consul for Banco &gt; / Question has been discussed v /ith Wallace Murray during his visit here and he was persuaded with some difficulty to be content ( omission ) visits from Consul Dhahran (2 grs. mut ). There would be no difficulty about arranging for an office to be placed at his disposal by Bapco on their premises and any necessary clerical assistance. It will no doubt be necessary to arrange for Bahrain to have radio-telephonic facilities. 2. Immediate cause for State Department*s pressure in this matter lies in presence in Bapco of large number of American workers engaged in refinery contraction and Wallace Murray is concerned that there should be (a) satisfactory police arrangements and (b) some arrangement for American participation on judicial side. 3. As to (a) it seems doubtful whether control by American Iiilitary Police will be acceptable to U .S .A. War Department and Hurray suggested that Oil Company might be able to furnish small number of civilian police. If not the State Department would wish to introduce some from elsewhere. While agreeing that assistance of American personnel would be desirable ( I presume they would appoint special police officers under regulation $io. 2 of 1939) I do not think we should accept poeiticn under which Political Agent would depend entirely on American personnel as his executive agents. It would presumably be equally unwise to depend on existing native police force for control of American personnel and it would therefore appear desirable to bring in some British Police personnel,say a Superintendent about half a do sen others in order to maintain our position. I should be prepared to ask War Office to move P.A.I.C. to release per sonnel for this ourpose in civilian capacity if no other source of supply e.g. India is available. 4. As to (b) Murray^ suggestion was that as a tempor ary expedient American Consul should be appointed to Let jointly with Political Agent in his court for hearing of toerican cases. This could not be done under existing Bahrain ©tnder lni:€ol&amp;Kid# and further would imply U.S.A. Consular Jurisdiction unless U.S.A. Consul sat on bench as a Jud^e appointed by His Uajesty's Government and not as Consul. Presumably if American Consul chose to attend Court purely as observer and without any judicial functions there would he no objection to this though it probably would not fully meet Wallace Hurray's needs. AltemativeJ.y • r ould it be practicable under Code of Civil Procedure as at present applied for Political Agent to try such cases as Senior Judge with aid of American Assessor which would include the U.S.A* Consul if desired or suitable members of Oil Company, I should also like to be assured that Americans charged with offences will have legal advice readily accessible to them.of India on these suggestions or any alternative suggestions for meeting American desiderata. You will appreciate that as v/e have gained our point over Consul it is important that vie should go as far as possible to meet wishes of /ijaericans on these ether points. Please treat matter as immediate as Wallace Murray ims asked to be given our further views on it before his departure towards the end of next week. -RETAXANDUM-Telegram S From Political Agent, Bahrain.

These appointments were made after conwultlng C.L.R. of Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Station Commander specifically for control of Bahrain Petroleum Company and B.M.P. employees. Station Commander has 4 British military police men whose services are always available in case of trouble with Oil Company employees. 3. H&amp;tive police must not be relied upon and I do not now welcome the idea of American Military Police unless they are picked wen. Colonel War bur ton Provost Marshal P.A.I.C. was recently here and after discussing position with him I gathered that P.A.I.C. could increase their Provost personnel and this would in my opinion be the best course* Provost personnel could if necessary be appointed special constables under Regulation 2 of 1939. 4. Judicial. Murray^ suggestion that American Consul should be appointed to act jointly with Political Agent in hearing American cases is objectionable from both political and legal point of view. Political Agent's loss of prestige would be very considerable and in no time he would be sharing the bench with a Persian colleague. American Consul can attend Judicial proceedings here as he can anywhere else In Empire and also act as Juryman or assessor. 5. Arrangements can be made for all cases in \ which Americans are accused to be investigated by an European magistrate as long as there is an Assistant Political Agent. Section 276 of Code of Criminal Procedure already allows for an American majority on a Jury and Section 2B4-A for American assessor and Political Agent could be instructed not to invoke Ms Section 30 powers in American cases. i ; 6.

I am indebted to Mr. T. Wikeley for his assistance in the preparation of this report. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, and to the Political Intelligence Centre, Middle East. I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN. Enclosure. Annual Report on Saudi Arabia for 1943. Introduction. HIS Majesty's Government's relations with the King and Government of Saudi Arabia were most cordial throughout the year, and Ibn Saud gave multiple evidence of his friendship and complete trust in His Majesty's Government. 2. The high lights of the year were the departure of the Vidhy Minister and the withdrawal of the Saudi Minister from Vichy, the departure of the German and Italian internees, both military and civil, Ibn Saud's attitude over the question of Arab unity, the greater interest being shown in this country by the United States, and, finally, a successful pilgrimage of some 42,000 persons, marred only'by one unhappy incident mentioned in the body of this report. 3. Mr. Stonehewer-Bird left Jedda on the 15th December, 1942, and Mr. T. Wikeley acted as His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires until the 2nd September, 1943, when Mr. Jordan arrived. The latter left for Riyadh soon after his arrival and presented his credentials to His Majesty the King in person on the 19th September, 1943. Arab Affairs. 4. The Arabs probably made more noise and caused more ink to flow (activities in which they are highly proficient) during 1943 than in any recent year. The ball of Arab unity, more or less quiescent at the opening of the year, was given a hefty kick in February by the Prime Minister of Iraq. The rest of the year was spent by the Arab leaders in pushing the ball back and forth in an indecisive and unco-ordinated manner. Never once did a team emerge capable of planting the ball firmly between the goal posts. Ibn Saud was, naturally, interested in the game, but his efforts were largely confined to pushing the ball, of which he has lively suspicions, away from him whenever it threatened to approach. If, in spite of his efforts, it came too close, he appealed to the referee (His Majesty's Government) either to take it away from him or to tell him how and where to kick it. If other Arab leaders had shown the same faith in the referee's honour and wisdom, much unnecessary trouble would have been avoided. 5. Ibn Saud believes that Arab countries should be independent, but he is far too wise and knows the Arabs far too well to hope that they will be able to sink their petty jealousies to form a strong federation for a long time to come. [51—38] b2 Until that distant day he considers that His Majesty's Government must con tinue to guide and control the destinies of the Arab world. 6. Ibn Saud is deeply suspicious of the rulers of Iraq, Transjordan and Egypt, and he realises they feel the same about him. This suspicion coloured all the King's reactions to the various proposals put forward during the year regarding Arab unity and allied matters. General Nun's proposal, early in the year, for a joint demarche of the Arab States to His Majesty's Government and the United States Government regarding Palestine was coldly received by Ibn Saud, who refused to move unless given a lead by His Majesty's Government. In particular, he was reluctant to bring the United States into the picture, though (he eventually approached the United States Government himself in the shape of a personal letter to President Roosevelt (see paragraph 13 below). The various proposals for an Arab conference which were produced by several Arab leaders throughout the year found Ibn Saud equally reluctant, especially as, at one stage, he tihought Nuri Pasha and Nahas Pasha were trying to leave him out in the cold. Apart from his innate suspicions of Nuri and Nahas, he thought, and no doubt rightly, that such a conference would achieve nothing except general confusion and possible embarrassment to His Majesty s Government and the Allies in their war effort. It was only when the idea of a full conference was abandoned in favour of a series of confidential talks between Arab leaders in Cairo, and then only after repeated reassurances from His Majesty s Government, that Ibn Saud consented to move. In September he received an envoy from Nahas, and, later, he sent Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Cairo to confer with the Egyptian Prime Minister. 7. The general question of the future of the Arab States could not, of course, be discussed without particular reference to Syria and Palestine. Ibn Saud is particularly interested in Syria, in the hope, possibly, that a strong and independent Syria will provide him with a useful ally against Iraq and Egypt. Nuri's proposals for a 'greater Syria,' including Palestine and Transjordan, were regarded by Ibn Saud as a device to advance the fortunes of the Hashimite family, and were in consequence very distasteful to him. Throughout the year, however, he watched the course of events in Syria with the greatest care, and gave valuable advice to the Syrian leaders. In particular, during the Lebanese crisis at the end of the year, he warned the Syrians and Lebanese to watch their step and to proceed only with the greatest circumspection in order to avoid providing the French with a lever for further oppressive action. 8. Palestine received its share of Ibn Saud's attention. He submitted to His Majesty's Government his fears regarding Zionist activities, and he received reassurances regarding His Majesty's Government's policy. He objected to Nuri Pasha's proposal to include Palestine in a ' greater Syria,' and he made his views regarding the Palestine question clear to the United States Government. The hope, which seems to have been held in some quarters in America, that Ibn Saud would receive Dr. Weizmann and settle the Palestine question with him, was shattered once and for all when Colonel Hoskins, President Eoosevelt's personal representative, visited Riyadh in August and enquired whether the King would receive Dr. Weizmann. The answer was in the categorical negative, and it revealed that, early in the war, Ibn Saud had been approached by the Zionists through the intermediary of Mr. Philby with an offer of £20 million if he would disinterest himself in the fate of Palestine. The King had con sidered himself insulted by such an offer, and his answer had been scathing. It later transpired that this money was not intended wholly as a bribe to Ibn Saud, but rather to go towards the rehabilitation of Arabs who would be trans ferred from Palestine to areas under purely Arab control. Relations with Foreign Powers. 9. In all the mass of Arab intrigues, jealousies and mutual recriminations -which were such a pronounced feature of the year, Ibn Saud took no step without consulting His Majesty's Government and following their advice. Thesame is true of his increasingly important contacts with the United States of America. Indeed, far from trying to play the United States off against Britain, a bait that any ordinary Arab would have swallowed with glee, he was reluctant to commit himself too far with the United States, and he had, sometimes, to be gently pushed by His Majesty's Government along the road to greater understanding and co-operation with that country. After Iraq's declaration of war against the Axis, a step which Ibn Saud regarded with an ironical eye, he en( ^ ir ® a whether His Majesty's Government would like him to change his own attitude3 (cf. report for 1942, second paragraph), and he would no doubt have declared war against the Axis if His Majesty's Government had so wished, but they did not. He sent warm and undoubtedly sincere congratulations to His Majesty's Government on the capture of Tunis and the capitulation of Italy, events which vindicated the faith he has always shown in an ultimate Allied victory, and which increased his already great reputation as a statesman in the Arab world. His speech to notable pilgrims assembled at Mecca at the end of the year was full of praise for Britain and it will no doubt have beneficial effects far beyond the borders of Saudi Arabia. He behaved very well when, at the beginning of the year, a British army contingent entered Saudi Arabia from Transjordan without permission or previous warning, in order to carry out certain observations in connexion with the survey of Transjordan. He waited patiently for an explanation and accepted it without demur. The activities of the survey party were called off by General Headquarters. He also permitted a locust mission composed chiefly of large army units to operate throughout his domains. 10. Ibn Saud's relations with other Powers were, on the whole, fairly good. He had various squabbles with Iraq which resulted in long wails to His Majesty's Government regarding the way in which he was being treated by the Iraqi Government. He was particularly incensed by the institution in the summer of a zone along the Saudi-Iraqi frontier within which severe restrictions were imposed upon the movements of tribesmen and their livestock. He con sidered this an infringement of his treaty rights, which, inter alia, stipulate that Saudi tribesmen shall be free to move across and in the area in question. . The other causes of friction were minor matters in themselves, but the continued failure of the Iraqi Government to pay any attention to any of Ibn Saud's protests produced an angry outburst in which the King even mentioned the possibility of resorting to force if he did not obtain satisfaction. 11. Relations with Syria were close, Ibn Saud playing the part of mentor to the Syrian leaders, who are just beginners in the hard school of politics and world affairs. Egypt and Transjordan, with whom in the past Ibn Saud's relations have not been happy, gave him little cause for complaint in 1943. In particular there was a pleasing absence of recriminations with Transjordan about frontier violations, &amp;c. The Amir Abdulla, however, by his ill-considered manifesto concerning Arab federation in April caused Ibn Saud great offence, though he said very little about it. Relations with the Yemen were peaceful, but Ibn Saud is watching the situation in that country with great care. There were some signs that the Imam is beginning to realise the value to the Arab world of Ibn Saud's prestige and statesmanship. Relations with the Persian Gulf States were normal and amicable. The ratification of the Koweit Agreements were exchanged at Jedda on the 1st May. 12. Ibn Saud's relations with the United States took a big step forward during the year. The King has all along been reluctant to travel either fast or far along the road leading to closer contact with the United States. The United States Government is still rather an unknown quantity for him, and he is anxious concerning the possible repercussions of extensive American activities in the Near East. He .expressed his fears in at least one message to His Majesty's Government in which he said bluntly that he preferred Britain to guide the destinies of the Arab States rather than America. He considers Britain, with her long record of co-operation with and friendship for the Arabs, can manage the Near East quite well by herself and that there is no need for America to butt in. There is some evidence to show that he fears His Majesty s Government may decide to disinterest themselves in the Near East and allow their place to be taken by America. 13. Saudi Arabia has been declared eligible for Lend-Lease. The announcement of this was made to Ibn Saud in Riyadh by Mr. Kirk in April, and the King immediately asked His Majesty's Government what it all meant and whether he should agree. He was reassured, and by the end of the year, after a certain quantity of badly needed Lend-Lease material had arrived, his anxiety at this new, and to him strange, development seemed to have worn off. United States interest in Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, based on the need for oil, was also shown by the promotion of their representative in Jedda to the rank of Minister Resident, and by the unprecedented flow of American visitors, most of them official. Mr. Kirk, who was then the United States Minister to this country, visited Riyadh in April. He was followed by General Hurley and by Colonel Hoskins. These three questioned the King exhaustively on many subjects, but the main object of their visit was to discover the King s [51—38] B 2views on Arab questions, Palestine, Syria, &amp;c. Ibn Saud made his views quite clear in many talks with these visitors and in a special message and a letter to President Roosevelt. The United States Government should therefore be fully informed of the King's views, and they have no further excuse for the ignorance which was displayed by the President's message to Ibn Saud regarding Weizmann (see paragraph 8). 14. Other American visitors were less important. They included, in the spring, a delegation from Life who eventually produced a long article about Saudi Arabia in their magazine which was notable for its inaccuracies and for the offence it gave by its references to the King's connubial affairs. Mr. Gunter, of the United States Treasury, visited the country in October to investigate the financial position. An American Military Mission visited the country at the end of the year (see paragraph 28). During the year the United States pressed for permission to create a consulate at Dhahran, but Ibn Saud would go no further than allowing tJhem to appoint a commercial agent with no repre sentative capacity. 15. The Vichy Legation was closed by the departure of M. Ballereau on the 19th June. The Italian and German internees left on the 14th March to be exchanged fot* an equal number of British in a Turkish port. The Netherlands Charge d'Affaires was promoted to the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary and presented his new credentials on 5th November. A new Iraqi Minister arrived to take over the Iraqi Legation in Jedda in March after a long interregnum during which Iraq was represented by a succession of charges d'affaires. The Saudi Arabian Minister at Vichy was transferred to Ankara in April. Finance. 16. The proposal to establish a Saudi Arabian Currency Board in London had not produced any definite results by the end of the year. A good deal of preparatory work was done, however, principally by Mr. Peters, Accountant- General of Palestine, who visited Jedda in March and had lengthy discussions with His Majesty's Representative and with the competent Saudi Arabian officials. Captain France, of the Minister of State's staff, also discussed this project when he visited Jedda in July. 17. His Majesty's Government subsidised Ibn Saud to the extent of £225,000 a month throughout the year (a total of £2,700,000), which was used for purchasing supplies from the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and other sources. In addition to the above, the following amounts of currency were granted to Saudi Arabia by His Majesty's Government. Riyals ... ... ... ... ... 5,000,000 Sovereigns ... ... ... ... 400,000 A further 8 million riyals were supplied at the end of the year by the United States under Lend-Lea.se, and another 7 million riyals are expected to be forthcoming from the same source early in 1944. The Lend-Lease riyals which have arrived to date were minted in India and the United Kingdom from silver loaned by these countries subject to replacement from the United States. _ _ ^ ^ 18. The Saudi budget for 1943 showed a deficit of 30 million riyals, approximately £2,250,000 sterling, despite the subsidy, gold, and riyals given to tihe country, and despite a small pilgrimage of 30,000 persons at the end of 1942. 19. During the year the Saudi Government received an advance of 1 million dollars from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which approximates to the amount of rental and oil subsidies accruing to the Saudi Government from the operations of the company in Saudi territory. Supplies. 20. During the year adequate supplies of foodstuffs, transport and essential commodities were sent to Saudi Arabia by the Middle East Supply Centre, which supplied practically the whole of the Saudi requirements. No acute shortage of foodstuffs was at any time evident and the Saudi Government are most appreciative of His Majesty's Government's efforts in this direction. The world shortage of cotton piece-goods had its inevitable reaction on this country towards the end of the year and led to urgent demands from the King for supplies from India.s ny 'Sy '4 k ;h' % a mi IkSc M ii«. fr m.

Some 42,000 pilgrims arrived in the country, of which approximately 37,000 came from overseas and 5,000 overland. The Saudi Government co-operated closely with His Majesty's Legation and all transport and supply arrangements worked smoothly. The financial and transport arrangements made by the office of the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, acting in co-operation with His Majesty's Eepre- sentatives in the territories concerned, were excellent and greatly contributed towards the success of the pilgrimage. 22. No Indian pilgrims made the pilgrimage, and Ibn Sand at the usual banquet given to leading personalities in Mecca during the pilgrimage stated, whilst regretting the absence of Indians, this absence was readily understandable and was due to war conditions and His Majesty's Government's solicitude for the safety of the Indian Moslems. He also made warm reference to the assistance given to the pilgrimage and to the Holy Land of Islam by His Majesty's Government. 23. Only one unfortunate incident marked an otherwise successful pilgrimage and this was due to the religious animosity existing between the Shia and Sunni Mohammedan sects. Several fanatical Persians of the Shia sect, as a protest against Sunni domination in the Holy Places, defiled the Haram in various disgusting manners. One of these caught in the act was tried by the Ulema under jSharia law and executed. This salutary punishment has led to repercussions in Shia countries and the Persian Government recently protested to Ibn Saud and threatened to break off diplomatic relations with this country if a satisfactory explanation is not forthcoming. Miscellaneous. 24. Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. —It was decided that the value to the war effort of this company's production of gold did not justify the utilisation of the large amount of shipping space required to provide them with materials and ^to take their products back to the United States. Ibn Saud was informed of this by His Majesty's Government in May, and was told that only sufficient space would be provided to carry materials essential for maintenance of the company's machinery. The King quite understood the position and made no protests. ^ At the end of the year the company was still functioning at a reduced tempo, but it is now hoped that sufficient supplies and spares will be forthcoming to permit the company to continue production. The present production is valued at about £30,000 monthly. 25. Netherlands Trading Society. —This firm, who act as bankers in Jedda, and are indeed the only real bank in the country, have for some years only been able to carry on with the assistance of the Government of India who allowed them to obtain in India and export to Saudi Arabia gold sovereigns. At the end of the year the Government of India announced that they would be forced to stop the supply of gold. It is not yet known whether the bank will be closed or not. 26. Meteorological—Ihn Saud gave permission for a party operating under the control of the Royal Air Force to establish meteorological stations at Jauf, Lina and Boreida and to teach the local officials to work them. The fullest assistance was given to the party while in Saudi Arabia and they were able to accomplish their mission in a satisfactory manner. 27. Locusts. —A greatly extended anti-locust campaign was planned and is ( being carried out in Saudi Arabia with the permission of Ibn Saud and the co-operation of the British army. In all about 1,000 men were working at the end of the year in different areas throughout the country. 28. A rms. —Ibn Saud has requested to be supplied with certain quantities of arms and ammunition for his soldiers. A great part of the year was spent in trying to ascertain how much he needed, how much he should be given and who should supply it. By the end of the year no arms had arrived, but a decision was within sight. The United States sent a military mission to Jedda in December to ascertain Saudi requirements. The mission, which was headed by General Royce, made itself unpopular with the Saudis by asking too many and irrelevant questions. The mission was not a great success, nor did the Saudis appreciate their arrival in full military uniforms. 29. Royal Family.—The King continued in good health throughout the year and kept firm control of all his vast dominions. There was some trouble amongst the tribes around Hail in May, but it appears to have been suppressed without much difficulty. Ibn Saud, of course, saw in this yet another instance of i&lt;/ I : 1^ 6 Hashimite intrigue. The King's younger brother, the Amir Mohammed bin Abdurrahman, died in July. One of the younger sons, the Amir Tallal, went to Egypt for medical treatement in August, while the Amirs Mohammed and Mansur had a joyful holiday in India, during which they spent large sums of money and indulged generally in the fleshpots. The Amir Mansur also visited Palestine and Egypt in the latter part of the year. The Amir Feisal, accompanied by his brother Khalid, visited the United States in October and returned via the United Kingdom. The Amir Saud, the Crown Prince, gave a useful indication of his attachment to His Majesty's Government at Riyadh in September, when he caused His Majesty's Minister to be informed that he was just as keen on the British connexion as his father, and that we could count on him when he succeeded to the throne of Saudi Arabia.I ^ Vifith the coiipliments of the Under Secretary of Stete '1^° for foreign Affairs.

Jordan His ilajesty 1.a/26, 12/9 &amp; p *9 by air irom Ibn Saudis shooting camp near M Hafiimah accompanied by Mr. Mann and Shaikh Yousuf Yasseen on the 28th March 1944. The plane refuelled and left after a halt of 3/4 of an hour I was informed of Mr. Jordan's arrival and immediately went to Muharraq aerodrome to see him. The conversation for the most part was of little interest but just before the plane took off I had the opportunity for a few minutes private conver sation Y /ith Mr. Jordan. He informed me that the Cairo Con ference had been cancelled, that Nahas Pasha had suggested that Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, and Sgypt shall stand together and apart from Iraq &amp;c., and that Ibn Saud had agreed. He also told me that there was a serious difference of opinion between Nuri Syed and Nahas Pasha, and that Ibn Saud was resisting American attempts at domination in Saudi Arabia and had recently dismissed Kajib Saleh as not only had he acquired over £ 250,000 during the last two years but he was philandering with the Americans and had definitely come under t^heir influence. Mr. Jordan also said that Ibn Saud had asked for a British financial adviser and for a British Military mission and that quite recently he had refused an American request to construct landing grounds at Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dhahran. It was Mr. Jordan's opinion that American gaucherie was doing much to increase the Arabs* preference for the British though as far as Ibn Saud was concerned his pro-British feelings were too deep rooted to be affected one way or the other by trivial incidents. 3. It is interesting that at the same time as Saudi Arabia is showing such definite preference for the British the ShairJi of Bahrain is in a small way doing exactly the same. He informed me recently that on no account would he have an Ameri can as a State employee in charge of the Iblectric Light Depart ment, and he referred in conversation with me to his long for Jeddah. /friendship2. friendship with the British and spoke v^ith strange lack of cordiality, considering what the Bahrain Petroleum Company have done for him, of Americans as a whole and the employees of the B.M.P. Corporation in particular. 4* I suspect that this hardening of the Shaikh 1 s attitude towards Americans has become known to the Company management for yesterday evening (March 27th) Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton the Chairman of the Bahrain Petroleum Company called to see me and referred to an incident which occurred quite recently at the causeway in which Lt. Merrill of the U.S. Air Force Y /as involved and during which Lt. Merrill undoubtedly laid hands on a Bahrain Government employee. Mr. Hamilton stated that he had heard of this incident and had made enquiries with regard to Lt. Merrill's outlook to the local inhabitants and his enqui ries had shown that the officer's attitude in his opinion was far from satisfactory. This in Mr. Hamilton's view was most regrettable as it tended to bring-Americans as a whole into disrepute and he personally was proud of the good relations which had existed between the Company and the Bahrain vrovernment and people for so many years and did not want anything to occur to impair their relations. Mr• Hamilton then stated that he had already spoken to Mr. Henderson the American Minister from Baghdad about Lt. Merrill's conduct and that he proposed to of speak to General Connolly/the Iraq— Persia Command during his forthcoming visit to Tehran and asked me if I had any objection to Lt. Merrill being transferred from Bahrain. I said that the incident was regrettable it was true but as far as I was concerned it was closed, that the officer in question had apologised and expressed his regrets and that there were no doubt faults on both sides. I went on to indicate that whatever Mr. Hamilton thought fit to do was his own business and that I should not view Lt. Merrill's transfer with alarm and despondency as I preferred that incidents did not take place however provocative people might be. ///naj Copy under Printed Letter No.534-b dated 5/6 /44- to 1.0 and Govt/I. 28-3-44 P.R.Telegram, From# To# Repeated 19/261 &amp; 61/11' S (D) India Office| London* Political Resident| Persian Gulf Political, Bahrain# * Government of India# No# 13171 Dated 10th and received 12th June 1944# Wy telegram No#9894 29th April.

J.M, Sir CONFlOE^TtrLBECOHOS I have the honour to inform you that at the beginning of November the Adviser to the Bahrain Government drew my (mj L. attention to the fact that Hussain,Namah and his son Ali who were considered to be subject^ of the Shaikh of Qatar and who had recently made tentative enquiries with regard to the \ possibility of their being accepted as subjects of His Highness, the Shaikh of Bahrain l/Mt* returned from Saudi Arabia complete with travel documents describing them as of Saudi Arabian nationality. 2. Hussain bin Namah was for some time the Director of the Customs at Qatar but recently,owing to internal intrigues in that State he was relieved of his appointment and found it convenient to leave that country and settle in Bahrain. Enquiries show that he was born in Iran and that he resided for many years in Qatar. When asked hov? it came about that he had obtained Saudi travel documents for himself and his son he stated that it was necessary for him to equip himself with papers which would permit him to travel and that^owing to his recent disagreement with the Shaikh of Qatar it was unlikely that the Qatar authorities would vouch for him he had gone to Saudi Arabia and had obtained permits from the local authorities on payment of two Rials for each document. He further stated that he had no difficulty in obtaining the papers as King Ibn Saud had instructed his passport department to grant Saudi nationality papers to anyone from the neighbouring /ArabArab States on an application being made even though the applicant had not resided in Saudi Arabia for the statutory three years. In this connection I enclose for your information a copy of a translation of Articles 8, 9, and 14 of the Saudi Arabian Nationality Regulations as furnished to me by the assistant to the Saudi Trade Agent here, 3. I shall be grateful if it can be ascertained if it is in fact correct that the Saudi Government permit any national of the neighbouring Arab States to acquire Saudi nationality with such incredible ease. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Bahrain.% Copy in translation of Articles 8, 9, and 14 of the Saudi Arabian nationality law. Article 8.

(b) He must have some means of livelihood (c) He must be of good character and conduct (d) He must not have been involved in any criminal offence, or served at least one year f s imprisonment. (e) He must express his intention to stay in Saudi Arabia (f) This nationality can only be granted by Supreme Order (g) He should attach to his application a certificate of permanent stay and his Saudi nationality and other official documents in his possession. The Government has the discretion to grant a Saudi Arabian Nationality whether the# above conditions are fulfilled or not. Article 9. A Saudi Arabian nationality may be granted by Royal Order to any applicant who, it is hoped, can be of great use to the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. Article 14. Any one who had stayed the period fixed for the grant of a Saudi Arabian nationality and then left the borders of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom before obtaining the said nationality and was absent for more than twelve continuous months becomes no more valid, and the previous period is not taken into account.

Annual Report on Saudi Arabia for 1944. Introduction. 1. In many respects the year 1944 heralded a new era in the history of Saudi Arabia. The tradition of mutual trust and friendship between King Ibn Saud and His Majesty's Government continued unbroken and was indeed strengthened throughout the year in spite of the impact of new develop- ments, chief among them being the prospect that His Majesty s Government could no longer agree to continue their financial assistance to the King on tne same scale as during 1943. Ibn Saud's loyalty to his friends however, remained steadfast and prevailed against the counsels of those of his advisers and officials Who began to turn to the United States as the goose that could lay the biggest ^'^^Among the most significant events of the year was the emergence into the foreground of Saudi internal afiairs of the United States the closer if rducUnf participation of Ibn Saud in Arab unity d~ n ^ st ; ncreasm g interest in the Yemen and King Farouk s request to visit ^ 3 The annual pilgrimage numbered some 42,000 pilgrims, approximately the same number as in 1943, and included a token pilgrimage of about 4,600 Indian for tbe first time since 1941. his own P 0Sltl ^J n H ^[ e a s %™ ve a rnmellt a P nd tlheir Allies in the prosecution ofa ^^A-b States against him. His' suspicions of ^ashimite intrigi^ rema yasin to advise Nahas Pasha 5. In March Ibn Saud sent Sheikh agreed The King also sent «' .b. A-Vity Conference in [62—62] ■ &gt;1 r l-'JJ t L ■2 Alexandria. He was incensed, too, that Nahas had not even bothered to answer his letter. In spite of a long apology from Nahas, Ibn Saud decided not to participate in the conference and told Nahas so in no uncertain terms. Finally, however, he agreed to send a delegate after the assembled Arab delegates had appealed to him in a joint telegram. Anxious not to commit himself, however, Ibn Saud instructed his representative Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to act as an observer only, thereby reserving his agreement to any resolutions until after he had studied them carefully. 6. Ibn Saud considered the Alexandria Protocol went too far and objected to anything which might conflict with the religious principles on which his kingdom was founded. On His Majesty's Government's advice, however, he showed himself more accommodating, although maintaining his reservation regarding religious principles. In this mood he discussed the question with Abdur Rahman Azzam Bey, the Egyptian special envoy who came to persuade him to accept the protocol, and at the end of the year there seemed a fair chance that he would do so. Later he agreed to allow his delegate to sign the protocol with certain reservations. 7. As regards the establishment of Arab propaganda offices in Washington and London Ibn Saud agreed in principle but here again was opposed to any precipitate action. He advocated that representatives of each Arab State should be sent to London and Washington bearing letters setting out the Arab case to His Majesty King George VI, President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill, and only in case these representatives advocated the establishment of propaganda offices would he agree to it. His reluctance to agree to the establishment of these offices is probably due to the embarrassment he feels in not being able to contribute towards their expenses on a scale commensurate with his predominant position in the Arab and Moslem world. 8. Ibn Saud continued to pay the closest attention during the year to the Palestine question which in his own words he described as ' the king-pin of Arab unity.' Though he himself admitted that as an Arab and a Moslem he could not but oppose Zionist ambitions in Palestine he never allowed his feelings to prevail over his conviction that it was not in the interests of the Arabs to raise this question during the war. One of the main reasons why he agreed to participate in the Alexandria Conference was the assurance given him by the various Arab leaders that the Palestine question would not be raised in an acute form. Quietly and without fuss Ibn Saud worked on the leaders of Egypt, Syria, the Lebanon and the Yemen to damp down controversy over Palestine and avoid precipitating a crisis. The Wagner resolution, followed by the Demo cratic and Republican parties' planks and the British Labour party resolution provoked no outbursts from Ibn Saud as they did in other Arab countries. In order to make sure that his policy was in accordance with His Majesty's Govern ment's wishes the King at the end of the year asked His Majesty's Government to restate their views and agreed to be guided by them in future discussions on Arab unity. 9. In Syria and the Lebanon Ibn Saud did his best to pour oil on troubled waters urging their leaders not to take any action prejudicial to Great Britain and her Allies while the war continued. Early in the year he took the opportunity of visits from Jamil Mardam and Riyadh as Sulh to emphasise this point of view. He was, as usual, in constant touch with 'Shukri Kuwatli on whom he exercises considerable influence. He was dismayed when Shukri accepted Nahas's invitation to the Alexandria Conference and tried hard to dissuade him. When Shukri appealed to him to support his protest against the proposed conclusion of a treaty with France Ibn Saud replied that he had himself to blame bacause of his intransigent attitude towards the French. He advised Shukri to follow His Majesty's Government's advice and warned him not to embarrass them in Syria. Although concerned over the question of a treaty with France Ibn Saud was reassured when His Majesty's Government declared that their policy regarding Syria remained unchanged. 10. The Iman Yehya, whom the King describes as a man living out of touch with the world, came increasingly under his influence during the year, and allowed himself to be guided by the King's wise counsels, not only over such seemingly remote issues as Arab unity but also over matters directly affecting the Iman as, for instance, the Haudh al Ma dispute. As regards the former, the Iman, on Ibn Saud's advice, sent a delegate to the Alexandria Conference with the role of an ' observer.' Over the dispute with the Government of Aden he accepted the King's strong hint to climb down and evacuated Haudh al Ma.tis; i Relations with Foreign Powers. 11. King Ibn S-aud continued to remain His Majesty's Government's firm friend and consulted them, as always in the past, on all major matters affecting the external and internal affairs of his kingdom. His trust in them remained unshaken, although anxiety about the future darkens the horizon. With the Americans he kept his relations on a friendly but not too intimate basis and, while naturally welcoming their increased assistance to his country, made it clear to his sons and officials and to the Americans themselves that he regarded His Majesty's Government as his first friends and would always do so. Ibn Saud is cautious towards the Americans for to him the shadow of Zionism looms behind all their activities in the Middle East; on the other hand, he is prepared to reap such advantages as he can from a rich friend like America. 12. The great Allied victories of 1944, culminating in the invasion of France, were sincerely welcomed by the King, who, as our staunchest friend in the Middle East in this war, has stood firm even in the darkest hour. 13. Relations with Egypt suffered somewhat owing to Nahas's discourteous treatment of the King, and it may be that King Farouk had this in mind when, towards the end of the year, he asked to visit Ibn Saud. The latter agreed, but preferred to postpone the meeting until after the pilgrimage, i.e., towards the end of January. 14. There was some tension in Saudi relations with Iraq at the beginning of the year owing to the frontier measures adopted by the Iraqi Government to prevent the smuggling of sheep from Iraq. Ibn Saud was highly incensed and threatened retaliatory action, but the measures were subsequently relaxed. The joint Saudi-Iraqi commission appointed to settle minor frontier disputes worked smoothly and efficiently during the year. The Haram incident at Mecca during the 1943 pilgrimage did not make Ibn Saud any more popular with Iraqi Shias and, mainly as a result of Shia agitation, only some 400 Iraqi pilgrims came on the Haj j in 1944 compared with 1,500 the previous year. Needless to say Ibn Saud was not perturbed at this development. 15. Owing to the King's close personal friendship with Shukri Kuwatli relations with Syria were excellent. The King's influence, moreover, played a large part in Syria's relations with other Arab, States and the Great Powers. During the year the Saudi Consulate-General in Damascus was raised to a legation. Although no Syrian representative had yet been appointed to Saudi Arabia at the end of the year the head of the Syrian pilgrimage delegation described himself as temporary representative of his Government and issued visas for Syria. The French Legation, who have hitherto represented Syrian interests in Saudi Arabia, did not object. As regards the Lebanon, the King early in the year wished to appoint Hussain al Uwaini, his trade agent in Beirut and a notorious character, as first Saudi Minister to the Lebanon, but, on His Majesty s Government's request, abandoned the proposal. 16. The Haram incident during the 1943 pilgrimage nearly provoked a break in Saudi relations with Persia. In reply to a telegram from the Shah, King Ibn Saud sent a letter justifying his action and there the matter appeared to rest, but relations remained at best strained for the rest of the year. The ban imposed by the Persian Government on pilgrims for the 1944 pilgrimage indicated the mood they were in. 17. Evidence of Ibn Saud's keen interest in, and possible designs on, the Yemen was to be seen in the despatch of a special envoy to Sana' to advise the Imam to improve his relations with Britain and to warn him to put his house in order. The envov, on his return, reported great dissatisfaction among the people with the Imam's' regime and a strong desire to place themselves under the rule of Ibn Saud. . 1 . . . , 18 With the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan the King maintained outwardly correct and friendly relations and there were no serious frontier disputes. The Amir, however, indulged in some gratuitous criticism of the way Ibn Saud allowed American companies to operate on the soil of the Holy Lands. Ibn Saud sent the Amir a firm reply refuting his criticisms and telling him not to listen to false rumours. The King also had cause to complain during the year to His Majesty's Government of some wild statements which the Amir was reported to have made regarding a possible invasion of Saudi Arabia by his forces 19. On His Majesty's Government's advice the King agreed to recognise the Provisional French Government. Relations with Turkey were normal. [62—62] B 2 1 ft' l: - hl Hi ... ; h ' i r' m mmFinance and Supplies. 20. Early in the year His Majesty's Minister warned the Saudi Government that the subsidy which His Majesty's Government had granted to the Saudi ■Government during the war years to offset falling pilgrimage revenues had multiplied each year until it now bore no relation to pilgrimage revenues, and that, owing to the war situation, His Majesty's Government would, in the future, have to restrict the subsidy to the actual requirements of the country. It would be difficult in the post-war period, when, judging the future by the past, a wave of economy would sweep over Great Britain and, indeed, over the whole of the United Nations, for His Majesty's Government to justify a subsidy on anything like the scale of that accorded in 1943. The Saudi Government were, therefore, advised to take measures for the reorganisation of their finances and economy in order to avoid any crisis likely to arise from a drastic reduction or, indeed, a cessation of subsidies in the immediate post-war period which might threaten the internal stability of the country. They were told that this could best be done by reducing their expenditure and increasing their revenue by the larger sale of goods and the sale of foreign exchange to merchants. They were reminded, too, that His Majesty's Government had only granted the subsidy to onset falling pilgrimage revenues, which were now accruing to the Saudi Government on something approaching the pre-war scale, thanks to the facilities which His Majesty's Government had created for pilgrims to visit the Holy Land. 21. The King asked His Majesty's Minister to discuss the whole matter with him at Riyadh. His Majesty admitted the need for financial reform and showed his desire for improvement by dismissing Nejib Salha, his Druze Director of Mines and Public Works, who had long exploited his position to line his own pockets. He replaced him by Izzet Din Shawa, a refugee Palestinian who enjoyed the King's confidence and has proved honest and reliable. The King also asked for a British Moslem financial adviser. At the same time, however, and while admitting the need for reform, the King pointed out that this was a long-term policy and could only be effected gradually, especially in a country like Saudi Arabia. He stressed the present penury of his realm and the need for immediate assistance, particularly as the last pilgrimage dues which had been paid abroad had not yet accrued to the Government. . 22. At the end of March His Majesty's Government submitted their new programme of assistance to the King. Its main points were a free gift o 200 000 sovereigns and the cancellation of the Saudi Government s debt oi 20 million riyals to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation against the revenue derived from the pilgrimage tariff items. While accepting it m principle Ibn Saud pressed for the payment to the Government of the pilgrimage dues, which under the baneful influence of his advisers and the attitude of Mr. Landis, had now become a very sore point with him. In the meantime a useful bargaining counter had turned up in the shape of a generous America which offered to make up any reduction which His Majesty's Government were for any ^reason obliged to make in their assistance to the Saudi Arabian Government. o A group of the King's advisers and officials, notably Sheikh Yusuf Yasm and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, realised that this was the easy and profitable way out and Plaved on the King's natural anxiety for his country m order to get the best deal. Abdullali Suleiman, in particular, was opposed to any reform which would weaken the position of Minister of Finance, which he had successfully and most profitably held since 1932. He and many others feared the prospect of a new order m Arabia and their attitude, though entirely censurable, is understandable and shared W the majority of their fellows in Government positions m every Arab countrv though not by the commercial community or the population m general. 23.' The King's attitude towards His Majesty's Government s offer subse- auently stiffened and it was clear that he felt that he could not manage with the help they were willing to give him. At this stage the Americans stepped m and when the British proposals were discussed with Mr. Landis and other American Middle East Supply Centre representatives, they criticised them as too drastic and argued that if the financial and economic stability of the countrv were to be maintained on a reasonable basis greater assistance was needed. Owing to the wide divergence of views the matter was referred to Cairo tor discussion between the British and American Middle East Supply Centre authorities and later to Washington and London. From May to late July tne matter was thrashed out on both sides of the Atlantic, but it was obvious that it the principles of friendly collaboration in Saudi Arabia, as in the whob ot tne Middle East, which had been agreed upon as a result of the visit of Wallace Murray to London, were to mean anything, a satisfactory agreement regardingh HI ioint Anglo-American assistance to King Ibn Saud was essential. Finally, the State Department and the Foreign Office agreed that the subsidy to Saudi Arabia should be a joint one shared equally between the United States and His Majesty's Government and that any approach to the Saudi Government on finance and supply matters should in future be made jointly. Accordingly a joint supply programme for 1944 was communicated to the King at Riyadh at the beginning of August. Briefly it consisted of an overall supply programme comprising supplies allocated to Saudi Arabia under the Middle East Supply Centre programme, supplied through commercial channels and paid for by importing merchants, and a supply programme of essential commodities supplied by His Majesty's Government and the United States in the form of a subsidy. In addition, His Majesty's Government undertook to provide £10,000 a month to cover the cost of Saudi missions abroad and the United States to provide 10 million riyals on credit Lend-Lease. At first the King asked for still further help, but after some of his requests had been met, gratefully accepted the programme. It should be noted here that His Majesty's Government's contri bution under the joint programme was additional to the sum of £450,000 paid by them to the Saudi Government as subsidy at the beginning of the year, the gift of 200,000 sovereigns, and the payment of the balance of the Saudi Govern ment's debt to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation after the deduction of the 1943 pilgrimage tariff revenue. 24. Anglo-American discussions regarding the 1945 joint subsidy had not yet begun at the end of the year as the State Department had not yet reached a decision on the matter. , 25. The question of the financial adviser whom the King had asked for was finally dropped owing to the desire of the United States to create an Anglo- American economic mission under United States leadership, as they claimed that the United States commercial interests in Saudi Arabia were greater than those of the United Kingdom. This contention was refuted by His Majesty's Govern- ment. i ta - u j 26. Towards the end of the year it became apparent that the^Kmg had indeed begun to realise the necessity for re-organisation and reform of the finances and administration of the country and there were signs of this which augur well for the future. (See below, paragraphs 36 and 39.) 27. An agreement was signed in October between the Saudi Government and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, under which the latter granted the Government a loan of £100,000 against the security of the 1944 pilgrimage revenues. The purpose of this loan was to provide the Government with funds which, owing to the collection of the pilgrimage dues abroad, were not imme diately available to them. Activities of the United States. 28. Much greater activity in Saudi affairs was displayed by the Americans during 1944 than in previous years. The staff of their Legation was greatly increased, and the former Minister Resident replaced by a full Minister, Colonel William A. Eddy, a member of the Office of Strategic Services, with long experi ence of the Middle East and a good knowledge of Arabic. In finance and supplies the United States became an equal partner with His Majesty's Government as described above. In addition to the assistance granted to the Saudi Government under the subsidy, which included ten million lend-lease riyals, some three million dollars were advanced by the Arabian American Oil Company (formerly the California Arabian Standard Oil Company). The United States Government also advanced to the Saudi Government, under Lend-Lease, a further sum o 10 million riyals to meet the riyal requirements of the Oil Company, the Mining Company, and the United States Legation in Jedda. The dollar proceeds of these sales to the companies and the Legation were credited to a Saudi account in Washington, 60 per cent, being retained to pay for the silver content and the minting of the riyals and the balance placed at the free disposal of the Saudi Government, with permission to purchase gold If required. The National City Bank of New York also began negotiating with the Government for the establish ment of branches in Dhahran and Jedda. In all this the Americans desire, naturally enough, was to play mother bountiful to the Saudis m order to strengthen their position in the country. Notable among increasing American activities were:— OH, The construction of a refinery at Dhahran with a capacity of 50,000 barrels a day and a pipeline between Ras Tanura and Bahrain. In (T r jM | i;6 addition there was the proposal to lay a pipe-line across Arabia to the Mediterranean. Aviation. —The United States Government early in the year asked the King for permission to construct airfields at Riyadh, Jedda and Dhahran to facilitate their ferrying service to the Ear East, but he refused. The question of the Dhahran airfield was again raised later, but the Americans do not for the moment appear to be pressing it. A request to establish an air-training centre in the Hejaz to train Saudi pilots was also refused by the King. Military Training and Arms, —A joint Anglo-American gift of arms and equipment was made to the Saudi Government, the United States supplying mainly rifles, automatic weapons and transport. American insistence on equal participation with the British in training and equipping the Saudi army led to the establishment in Taif of an American and a British military training team. The idea of a British Moslem military mission which the King had requested earlier in the year was dropped. The Americans also offered to train Saudi personnel in Egypt. Agriculture. —An American mission of eight experts was accepted by Ibn Saud in order to assist the development of agricultural pursuits in Saudi Arabia. The first members of the mission arrived at the end of December. Roads. —The Americans made an aerial survey of the country during the year ostensibly to facilitate the alignment of the proposed north-south and east-west highways, which they had offered to construct, but in reality to gain a greater knowledge of the physical features of the country and to assist the oil company to ascertain the probable oil-bearing areas in Saudi Arabia. A ground party also operated for a short period from Taif. Wireless. —A request by the Arabian-American Oil Company to establish a wireless station at Dhahran for direct communication with America was referred by the King to His Majesty's Government, and at the end of the year was under discussion between Washington and London. Consulates, —On His Majesty's Government's advice the King agreed to the appointment at Dhahran of an American consul to look after the affairs of the increasing' number of oil company's employees. Education. —The .Americans offered facilities for a number of Saudi students to study at tihe American University, Beirut. Propaganda. —Towards the end of the year there was a considerable increase in the distribution of material received from the Office of War Information and an Arabic-speaking attache of the Legation was put in charge of the work. Pilgrimage. 29. The number of pilgr-ims arriving in the Hejaz was about 42,000, as last year, and included for the first time since 1941 a token pilgrimage of some 4,600 pilgrims from India. No special financial arrangements were made by His Majesty's Government, as in 1943, to assist the Saudi Government, and the latter fixed their own tariff rates abroad, which were considerably higher than for 1943. As a result there was considerable criticism of the Government and only some 10,000 Egyptian pilgrims arrived, as compared with over 16,000 in 1943. Generally speaking, however, the pilgrimage was a success and there were no hitches in transport and supply matters. Shipping arrangements were as last year co-ordinated in Cairo by the office of the Minister Resident in co-opera tion with His Majesty's representatives in the various countries concerned. There was the usual close collaboration between His Majesty's Legation and the Saudi Government on all pilgrimage matters. As last year, these combined efforts played a large part in ensuring the smooth working of the pilgrimage. 30. King Ibn Saud did not come on the pilgrimage, but was represented instead by the Amir Faisal, who made no speech at the annual banquet for pilgrims at Mecca. 31. There were no incidents during the pilgrimage. As already stated, the Persian Government refused to allow their pilgrims to do the Hajj. Six Soviet Moslem pilgrims from.the Central Asian Republics arrived in tihe Hejaz, the first to come from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics since 1927. Middle East Supply Centre. 32. 1944 saw a rapid expansion in the organisation and control of the Middle East Supply Centre in Saudi Arabia. As a concession to the Americans, an American head^of the centre was appointed early in the year. An Anglo- American-Saudi Co-ordinating Committee was set up to deal with the demanas of local merchants and regulate imports through merchant channels, ineMiddle East Supply Centre became the machinery for the supply to Saudi Arabia of all commodities included in the Anglo-American subsidised supply programme. As such it ensured the arrival before the end of the year of most of the essential commodities such as cereals, tea, sugar, vehicles and spare parts included in the joint progmmme. The shipment of cotton piece-goods was unfortunately delayed owing to technical difficulties with the Government of India and of the 1,000 tons programmed from that country and some 430 tons under Lend-Lease from the United States of America only some 380 tons had arrived by the end of the year. Royal Family. 33. King Ibn Sand's health took yet another year, a year full of new developments and activities, in its stride without visible effort. He continued to show himself as able and energetic as ever in the conduct of the multitudinous affairs of his Kingdom. There were no tribal troubles and public security remained excellent. In May the Commander-in-chief, Middle East, General Sir Bernard Paget, visited the King at his hunting camp north of Riyadh, together with His Majesty's Minister. At the end of December the King came down to Mecca to prepare for the meeting with King Farouk. The Amir Sand has been appointed Commander-in-chief of the Saudi army and the Amir Mansur Minister of Defence. The latter accompanied His Majesty's Minister on a visit to Khartoum to inspect facilities for training Saudi, army personnel (see paragraph 34). Miscellaneous. • 34. Military Training and Arms. —(Reference paragraph 28.) Of the joint Anglo-American gift of arms the British share comprised heavy equipment such as armoured cars, anti-tank guns and mortars, in addition to lorries. Instruction of Saudi army personnel in the use of these was begun in June. Arrangements were also in hand at the end of the year for Saudis to be trained in the Sudan and Egypt as drivers and mechanics. 35. Locusts.— large British locust mission which began operating m Saudi Arabia at the end of 1943 completed a successful campaign in June 1944. A second campaign was under way at the end of the year, but on a reduced scale owing to lack of transport. The'Saudi Government are becoming more locust- minded and are co-operating with the mission by furnishing regular locust and rainfall reports. 36. A griculture. —Increasing attention was paid during the year by the Middle East Supply Centre to the question of agricultural development m Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Government were represented at the Middle East Agricul tural Conferences in Cairo and elsewhere, and a Middle East Supply Centre mission visited Saudi Arabia in March to study the possibilities of developing A1 Kharj, the Government agricultural centre near Riyadh. A report was drawn up with recommendations and submitted to the King later in the year. As a result, the administration of A1 Kharj, which has long been an expensive white elephant, was cleaned up and efforts are now being made to place it on a sound economic basis. . . £ 37 Education. —Evidence of Ibn Sand's appreciation of the need tor a wider education of the youth of his country was shown by his agreement to the proposed appointment of a number of British Moslem teachers m Saudi schools to teach English and to the education of selected Saudi students at Victoria College and in the Sudan. Unfortunately, Victoria College was at the last moment unable to accept them, but arrangements were subsequently made for the sons of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and a Jedda merchant to enter the college Books and sports equipment were presented to the Saudi Education Department during the year by the British Council. x t p ^ 38. Roads. —A small party of Royal Engineers operated for some months in the Hejaz instructing Saudi road gangs m the work of repairing some of the worse stretches of the Jedda-Riyadh highway. j -n , r w i t 39 Transvort —The new Director of Mines and Public Works, Izzet Dm Shawa,' who is also Director of Transport, began on a large-scale reorganisation of the Government garage at Jedda. Corrupt officials were dismissed and a number of Egyptian technical experts appointed. As a result it is hoped that the transport situation will improve. . • n , TCaaWn 40. Wireless. —A number of Saudi operators were trained by the Eastern Telegraph Company in Port Sudan and six were sent to Cairo for special training by tie British Overseas Airways Corporation with a view to operating the new //-» Iwireless telegraphy station which was erected in Jedda at the end of the year for communication with aircraft. 41. Meteorological. —A selected Saudi operator was trained in Iraq by the Royal Air Force. King Ibn Saud also agreed to operate at Saudi expense certain meteorological stations which had been established in Saudi Arabia as a result of the visit of a Royal Air Force meteorological party in 1943. 42. Commercial. —The Basra manager of the Eastern Bank visited Jedda to discuss with the Saudi Government the opening of branches at Jedda and A1 Khobar. It was decided, however, to postpone definite proposals and await the outcome of negotiations between the National City Bank of New York and the Saudi Government (see paragraph 28). Reference paragraph 25 of report for 1943. The Netherlands Trading Society continued its operations during the year. It is thought that the necessary gold is imported from Egypt through the Netherlands Legation. 43. Concessions. —Lieutenant-Colonel de Gaury visited Saudi Arabia at the end of the year on behalf of a British company in order to negotiate with the Saudi Government for the grant of a concession to exploit minerals other than oil. The Government agreed to grant him a preferential position for one year provided his terms were not less favourable than any others offered to the Government during that period.1,&gt;V THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ARABIA.

Sir, Jedda, 23rd February, 1945. I HAVE the honour to confirm my telegram No. 103 of to-day's date, in which I reported the presentation 'of my letters of credence to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz ibn Abdurrahman A1 Saud on the 22nd February. Mr. Jordan, who had travelled with me from Cairo on the 20th February, remained in effective charge of this legation until yesterday's ceremony. 2. It is unusual for the head of a diplomatic mission to remain at his post until hi§ successor arrives to replace him, and the circumstances imposed by your instructions in this sense to Mr. Jordan, and by King Ibn Sand's return to Jedda from his visit to Egypt, did not permit procedure in accordance with any strict precedent of protocol. I was willing to await Mr. Jordan's departure before raising with the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs the question of the presenta tion of my letters of credence, but I was given to understand that His Majesty might be surprised if I made no approach to present them to himself during his sojourn in the Hejaz. I therefore requested Shaikh Hafez Wahba, his minister in London, who is at present in attendance on King Ibn Saud, to take His Majesty's pleasure in the matter, and I was informed that King Ibn Saud was prepared either to receive me at Shumaisy on the 22nd February or to make a special journey from Mecca to Jedda for the purpose on the 23rd February. As the first alternative was obviously the less exhausting to His Majesty, I requested that audience might be granted me at Shumaisy. 3. Shumaisy lies fifty kilometres to the east of Jedda, and twenty kilometres from Mecca, just outside the sacred area of the Haram. No non-Moslem may approach more nearly to the Holy City than the boundary stones which stand there. It was at Shumaisy, after the ' Pledge of the Tree,' that the Prophet signed an historic truce in the year 628 a.d . with the Qoreish tribe by which he bound himself not to enter the Haram nrecincts for a twelvemonth. Thither I proceeded yesterday afternoon in His Majesty's private car, accompanied by the Commander of the Royal Bodyguard and by all members of the legation stan authorised to wear uniform. My own uniform was borrowed plumage, Mr. Jordan being fortunately no slimmer a figure than myself. 4. Having inspected a guard of honour, which was to make frequent later appearances at various unexpected points, I Avas welcomed by Shaikh Hafez Wahba and by Shaikh Hamad Sulaiman and took the first of many cups or coffee in a tent placed at our disposal. I was then conducted with my start to His Majesty's tent, outside which we were greeted by His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal. His Majesty was alone, except for a distant group of attendants. He rose to receive us and welcomed myself and my staff, whom I formally pre sented, and he remained standing while I presented Mr Jordan s letters of recall and my own credentials, and delivered a short speech, the English text of which is enclosed herein. O I delivered this speech in Arabic, which appeared to please His Majesty, who listened with close attention and uttered grateful and appre ciative noises at the end of each paragraph • , . * - a i.- 5 In replv he expressed sentiments of admiration and sincere friendship for His Maiesty The King and for His Majesty's Government, and made me warmly welcome to his dominions, offering the fullest measure of co-operation and assistance in my mission. We then sat down, and, after coffee and a further 'T m I. SSfiSl-SJSU*- . liltl. later, with His Maiesty, with Mr. Man as interpreter, for rather more than an hour. We were by then in Arab clothes, which are the accepted wear for Europeans visiting His Majesty elsewhere than in Jedda, and at the banquet offered to us (!) Not printed. [63—74] I J IBafter sunset all of the Legation staff present were picturesquely enrobed. I took my leave shortly after this meal and we returned to Jedda, accompanied by the Commander of the Royal Bodyguard, in time to celebrate George Washington's birthday at the American Legation. 7. I had requested Shaikh Hafez Wahba, when we met earlier in the day, to renew previous representations to His Majesty with a view to restrainino- his somewhat embarrassing tendency to shower presents on official visitors on such occasions, and 1 am glad to report that no gifts were made. It is, however, possible that His Majesty's intentions in this matter as regards myself are to become effective later, when the Minister Resident in the Middle East pays his visit to Riyadh. King Ibn Saud invited me to journey to Riyadh as his guest, to be there during Sir Edward Grigg's visit. 8. I cannot close this despatch without recording the extremely happy impression made upon me by this initial contact with King Ibn Saud. It is indeed difficult to resist a charm so obviously uncalculated, in which a salty intelli gence and great natural generosity of mind combine with simple sincerity of speech and very great dignity of demeanour. His manner of utterance and use of the unfamiliar Nejdi dialect of Arabic unfortunately prevent me, and will continue to prevent me for some time, from completely intimate conversation with him, but I feel that our relations will always be marked, and made either easier or less easy as circumstances dictate, by His Majesty's manifest sincerity and by his no less manifest conviction that his confidence in the righteousness of British intentions is based on a correct reading of British character. The frequent reflection of this attitude of His Majesty in his words and, indeed, in his acts, may be designed to render more difficult any contrary or unsympathetic action on the part of His Majesty's Government, and the constant advertisement of King Ibn Saud's confidence in British intentions may itself be intended as an additional plea for their integrity. The fact remains that His Majesty has been our most consistent propagandist and supporter among the rulers of the Middle East, and will be judged by our actions as well as by his own. 9.

N Copy No. 127 Mr. Grafftey-Smith to Mr. Eden. 1 —[Received 26^ June?) (No. 104.) . 1945. WITH reference to your telegram No. 274 of the 1st June and relative correspondence relating to the Viceroy's visit to Ibn Saud, I have the honour to inform you that his Excellency, accompanied by Sir Evan Jenkins, private secretary, and Captain Henderson, aide-de-camp, arrived m Jedda by air trom Cairo on the 3rd June. Conflicting reports from Egypt had left us m some doubt to the expected time of arrival of the Royal Air Force Lodestar m which the Viceroy travelled. In the event, the party arrived rather m advance of the earlier of the times indicated; but, fortunately, the Emir Mansour was already at the air- nort to welcome his father's guest. n- • ^ 2. It is conventional to wear Arab clothes when travelling m the interior of Saudi Arabia, especially when visiting the King. I had suggested to Lor Wavell before he left Cairo that he should conform with this practice, and his willingness to do so gave great pleasure in this country. In the Kmgsprivate apartments at the Khuzan Palace, where the visitors rested briefly ore tinning their journey, a carnivalesque atmosphere of private theatr^als reig while sirwals and thoha were distributed and assumed, Arab cloaks draped, and white head-dresses fastened with a gold fillet. Breakfast, when it came, was mor | a ^a^ja^^ 1 ^^ i^ e it clear that he expected me to accompany the legatkm dispensary, to the Viceroy. Of the flight, which was remarkably bumpy, the less said ^ ^ uwa j|-j a landing ground some 50 kilom. from Riyadh, sfeasBwasssesfes I ly tad 5 o'ctak „d to lh.. much appreciated. f h fter tlle sunge t 6. Dinner was ^f^ on t^ pa a^e root^ a ^ ghort ^ ^ prayer. It was a . s ™^ attftudes For music we had the reed-like voices ^^'Kr'Vll^fchfnShfKomn on a near-by roof, and the drone of a of five bhnd devote , bac L roun d, Ibn Saud's fantastic bodyguard, in their distant water-wheeL lor ba^K n rose-water and frankincense and per- bravery of silks and gold^ Alter am ^ made the unusual f ™ed oil were ceremo f - onl p P hicl ; we could look down into his private wmg of the paface Then, 'having introduced a batch of about twenty of his sons, he settled down for a talk with the Viceroy. [67—47] I I /AH7. His Majesty had asked me whether it would be incorrect to speak of official matters to Lord Wavell during his visit, and I had assured him to the contrary. What he, in fact, asked was that India should help to relieve the great shortage of consumer goods in this country, and that various purchases made by two of his sons in a raid on India in 1943 should be licensed for export. Neither request is likely to commend itself to the Government of India, but Lord Wavell was good enough to say that he would see whether anything could be done. 8. The Viceroy then persuaded Ibn Saud to tell the story of his capture of Riyadh from the garrison of Ibn Rashid forty-odd years ago. His comments reminded the King that he had a field-marshal for an audience. ' Soldiers always understand each other,' His Majesty said; and he instructed the Emir Nasser, Governor of Riyadh, to show us, on our way home, the famous spear-point in the citadel door, and blood-stains, still startling on the wall, which remain from the night when young Abdel Aziz ibn Saud won the first of many desert victories. 9. The King's gifts were sent to the Viceroy and his party, including the Royal Air Force officers of his aeroplane, after they had .returned to the Badia Palace. Lord Wavell's presents to Ibn Saud, which I took to him next day, included a beautifully illuminated manuscript of the Koran. 'He could not have given me a gift more precious,' the King remarked. 10. The Viceroy made an early start on the 4th June, as he had to join the Sunderland flying-boat at Bahrain at 9 a.m. I remained in Riyadh at the King's request. The Emir Khaled and Nasser accompanied Lord Wavell to Buwaib, to wish him Godspeed on their father's behalf. 11. The Viceroy's visit was, I think, a complete success. I fear that the circumstances of Arabian hospitality in June were occasionally arduous, but Lord Wavell took all discomforts in his stride and, if I may say so, matched the King's simplicity and natural dignity with his own. The establishment of imme diately friendly relations was, perhaps, natural; but it was none the less pleasant to observe. 12. Some credit for removing the barriers of race and language must certainly go to Shaikh Izzedin Shawa, Director of Mines, Public Works and Transport in Jedda, who, at my suggestion, accompanied the party as interpreter when Mr. Mon, on doctor's orders, was unable to travel. Shaikh Izzedin Shawa. a Palestinian political exile and Cambridge graduate, reserves his anti-British mood for the Zionist problem. His interpreting was supple and impeccable. 13. I am reporting in a separate despatch such developments as occurred after the Viceroy's departure from Riyadh. 14. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to the Minister Resident in the Middle East. I have, &amp;c. L. B. GRAFFTEY-SMITH.61/11 Nov* that the appointment of an American Consul to Dhaiiran has hecoine a fait accompli, P.R. may •wish to reconsider the vie^ expressed in the last sentence of para» 4 of S#8 (19/261). International usage will presumably have to be considered if we are to avoid repercussions at a later date,* One point iss Can a Consul appointed to a particular district in one independent sovereign State be granted an exequatur by another Power recognising him as Consul for a district in another State which is under the protection oi that Power and whose foreign relations are controlled by that Power ? If this point is conceded in the case of the Americans, it will be difficult to refuse similar requests from Persians, Iraqis and others for similar facilities for their Consuls at Jedda or elsewhere. Please also see Arts, 92, 93 and 427 of Oppenheim r s International Law, Vols 1* Though no Treaty of Protection^ has been entered into by * / / H.M.G. and Bahrain, by the Exclusive Agreement of Mo', fj/p 1892 the latter formally undertook not to have CUjelCsc* relations with other foreign powers and thereby virtually became a protectorate.^This has, however, never been admitted and in rebutting Persia's ^ /?tcx 33 claim to Bahrain in 1928 H.M.G. avoided rt any —^pTfk def inite statement as to their own position in ' ' Bahrain or its basis. 11 As matters stand therefore there does not appear to be any need to obtain the Shaikh f s ^authority 11 to the present appointment as suggested in 3, 113* Indeed, to do so now will make it impossible to take * stand on tlh* Agreement of 1892 in the future and it may also be a source - , of encouraging Rulers of Bahrain to arrogate to themselves a. position they do not possess. They are already aspiring to 'Royalty*. Further, owing to its geographical position Bahrain will assume international importance in the post-war world which Zanzibar will never, hence the practise followed in Zanzibar cannot be taken to serve as a guide. In the circumstances it may be desirable not to recognise the jurisdiction of the American Consul at Dhahran formally by granting an exequatur^ but simply to acquiesee in his performing certain Consular functions in Bahrain. This would not give him the right of maintaining a Consulate and flying a Flag and would maintain the status quo.- x it K.t !• The only Saudi /Nationality Law that we have been able to trace is the Hejaz-Nejd Nationality Law amended to February, 1931 (Volume C-33 page 185), but the articles / furnished to Political Agent by the Saudi Trade Agent do not correspond, and the Trade Agent is evidently referring to a late enactment. We may therefore telegraph to Jedda to send us a copy of the Saudi Nationality Law as amended up to date, D.f.a. 2, It will be noticed that Article v of the Law of 1926 -31 contains a provision similar to Article 9 of the later enactmentjnor can any exception be taken to it as International Law recognises the natural competence ofA, State, to grant naturalisation upon any conditions it likes. m / 1, , a*-—! n-Yr 'k\ :c . i^wi.
