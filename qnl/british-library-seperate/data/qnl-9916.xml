Much of the correspondence speculates on the extent of Persia's interest in the pearl fisheries that are not within their own territorial waters, including not only those identified by the British as being Arab fisheries but also the following recently identified fisheries: shallow beds outside territorial waters that have not been worked by Arab pearl divers, and deep beds outside territorial waters that have not been exploited by Arab divers and in fact cannot be exploited without mechanical equipment.The file contains copies of correspondence between the Admiralty, the India Office, and the Foreign Office, which discusses how best to protect the deep water beds from foreign exploitation (i.e. by Persian, Japanese, or other foreign parties), in light of the fact that the Arab rulers have no valid claim to exclusive fishing rights.In addition, the file includes correspondence on the following: an expedition to the Iranian side of the Gulf by a Danish citizen named Dr Harald Blegvad, Director of the Danish Biological Station, who has been engaged by the Iranian Government to investigate the waters of the Gulf, with particular reference to fishing; the potential impact that deep-sea operations might have on fishing in shallow pearl beds.Correspondents include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Kuwait; the British Minister, Tehran; the India Office; the Foreign Office; the Admiralty; the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]; the Director of the British Museum (Natural History), Clive Forster-Cooper; Dr Cyril Crossland, zoologist at the University of Copenhagen's Zoological Museum.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of the Danish Biological Station</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of the Natural History Museum</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Cyril Crossland</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl fisheries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Marine biology</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fishing rights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Zoology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a3#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
