Will you please refer to paragraph 2 of your demi- official letter No o 469-S dated the 10th May 1939 to the India Office in regard to the utilisation of the Kalba concession money ? 2. I wrote to Shaikh Khalid as instructed, hut his reply, while assuring me that 'the revenue of Kalba is kept xn the State Treasury andspent on mattersconcerning Kalba State', did not refer specifically to the oil concession money. I i therefore made a further enquiry from him ancpiave now had a reply dated the 23rd July 1939, of *i ch I enclose a copy. 3* This reply is, I think, entirely satisfactory, andin view of the fact that the Company's object in concluding the Kalba Concession was partly to provide for an approach to the hinterland tribes through Shaikh Khalid no objection need, I suggest, be taken to Shaikh Khalid's statement that some of the men ey is used to 'ensure facilities for the future and to obtain the necessary security for the geologists and all other work'.

The Honourable Lt.Col.Sir Trenchard Fowle, HCIS., CBS., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz.Translation of a letter dated the 5th Ja; 1353 (23rd July 1939) from Shaikh Khalid bin , of Kalba, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, After Compliments, I beg to say that all is well on our side, and by the Grace of God everything is all right, I was much pleased by the receipt of your kind letter No ,393 of 12th Jamad al Awwal 1358 (30,6,39), With reference to your remark that my last letter of 8th Rabi-ul-Thani 1358 (28,5.39) in reply to your first letter was not clear about the matter which you have meit ioned, and that the Honourable the Political Resident has asked you for a confirmation whether the revenue derived from the oil concession is included in the State r s income. There is no doubt that it is included in the income of the State and the amounts spent for establishing order and tranquility among the tribes is paid out of the same. No doi bt you understand that matters have changed and are different from what they were some years ago. Formerly it was not necessary for the Kalba Government to endeavour to please i . the tribes, but now, in order to safeguardthe interests of the State, preserve its prestige and ensure facilities for the future, and to obtain the necessary security for the geologists aid all other work, it is necessary to do so. I am well prepared to discharge the duties which 1 have undertaken and pray the Almighty to help me. Usual end ng.&lt;rp-—^ . P.Z. 4843/39 . Minute Paper political Department T Tnder Secretary of State, Please see tb.e minutes on P.Z.32S5 and 421 ^ dealing with the Kalb a pnd Abu Dhabi Concessions. Mr.Longrigg has now replied to our letters and states that his Company is prepared to give an assurance, by exchange of letter, that before any repatriations of foreign personnel take place they would consult the Political Agent. They assume that this would be confidential and without the cognisance of the -Sheikh. This seems satisfactory and I see no reason why the Sheikh should be brought into the matter, particularly in view of the fact that the Company say that there will be a definite understanding with tneir foreign employees that if they are found unsatisfa ct ory they will be liable to repatriation. As regards natural gas, the omission was apparently only due to a desire to simplify the concession pnd the Company are ready to give a.n assurance that they will not produce or sexl natural gas otherwise than upon the payment of royalty to the Sheikh. This seems quite adequate and we need not pursue our original suggestion of an exchange of letters with the Sheikh on this point. As regards the two Political Agreements, Mr.Longrigg raises the same points on each. The first seems quite unobjectionable. As to the second point, the omission of the phrase was due I think to a desire to avoid possible difficulties over the interpretation of the word ’’unreasonable’ 1 and I suggest that we should stick to our proposal. As to the third point, the Company have evidently overlooked the fact that the Sheikhs are not to be cognisant of the Political Agreements in this case and consequently the Article in question is not applicable. I submit drafts to the interested departments and on receipt of their replies it/ (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

Concession we are still waiting to hear from the Political Resident that Sheikh Khalid has exchanged letters with the Political Agent confirming that the oil money is being retained for the State and its minor ruler and duly accounted for in the State accounts which he keeps. (Sd.) R.T.Peel, 16/8.mi INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.l. P.Z. 4843/39. 22nd August, 1939. Would you please refer to the tv/o letters from Petroleum Concessions Ltd., dated the 8th August distributed with India Office letters Nos. P.Z.4842/39 and P.Z. 4843/39, dated the 12th August, on the subject of the concessions granted to the Company by the Sheikhs of Kalba and Abu Dhabi. With regard to the three points raised by Longrigg in his first letter, P.C. 24/62 as to the Political Agreements, there seems to be no objection to the first. As to the second, the omission of the phrase 'the Sheikh shall not unreasonably withhold such permission' had no special significance, but v/e felt that it was liable to raise awkward questions as to what was or was not unreasonable behaviour and that as it was not strictly necessary it v/as better to leave it out. V/e would propose to adhere to the omission of these words. Eyres, Esq., Foreign Office H.M. In/2 . In raising the third point the Company seems to have overlooked the fact that the Sheikhs in this case are not to he cognisant of the Political Agreements and therefore this particular Article is not applicable. As regards the two matters relating to the Abu Dhabi Concession dealt with in Longrigg*s letter PC.33/63, the fact that the Company intend to make it a definite understanding that foreign personnel imported into Abu Dhabi will be liable to repatriation, if found unsatisfactory, should no doubt help to ensure that no difficulties should arise in practice, but it would seem preferable to adhere to our proposal, to which the Company is prepared to agree, for an exchange of letters with the Company requiring a reference to the Political Agent in cases of repatriation. The Company can be informed that there will be no need to bring the Sheikh into the matter. As regards the other point as to the production and sale of natural gas, we would suggest that the/3 . the matter will he adequately covered hy the Company’s offer to give an assurance that they will not produce or sell natural gas otherwise than upon payment of royalty to the Sheikh and that we need not press our original proposal for an exchange of letters between the Company and the Sheikh. Both these points might he dealt with in the letter which we propose to exchange with the Company. If you agree with our views on these points it is proposed now bo convey to the Company the approval of His Majesty’s Government bo the oil concession granted hy the Sheixh 01 Abu Dnahi as soon as the Political Agreement has been executed. As regards the Kalba Concession, we are still waiting to hear from Powle that the exchange of letters between Sheikh Khalid and the Political Agent has taken place, see paragraph 2 of Powle’s demi-official letter of 10th May, 469 S.

INDIA OFFICE. uv'T ■ U J-L i\V Jr 4f* &gt; Dear Mr. Peel, With reference to your letter PZ. 3225739 dated August 1st regarding the Political Agreement arising out of our Kalbah Concession, there are three points in the draft to which I should like to refer. The first occurs in the sixth line of Article 4: would you agree to the addition of the words n or at some point on the Trucial Coast T to the existing words n in Kalbah or Bahrain”, since our representative may be for long periods resident at Sharjah or Dubai? Secondly, is there any significance in the omission of the phrase 'the Shaikh.shall not unreasonably withhold such permission' (a phrase which occurs in Article 10 of the Dubai and of the Sharjah Political Agreements) from Article 10 of the proposed Agreement? The Article, found as Article 11 in the Dubai and the Sharjah Agreements,regarding arbitration in the case of attempted termination by the Shaikh, is omitted from your now proposed draft. It seems that the situation visualised in these Agreements might equally well occur in our relations with the Regent of Kabbah! R. T. Peel, Esq. India Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1.

V/. 1. 15th June, 1939, Dear Gibson, Would, you please refer to your letter Ho. p.3.1608/39 of 15th April, about the Abu Dhabi Concession. We agree, since Petroleum Concessions Limited have now received a concession for Ajman, that there will be little harm in leaving Umm al Qaiwain alone for the present. Our remarks upon the points enumerated in paragraph 4 of your letter are as follows (i) We do not wish to comment on the question of provision for a royalty on natural gas. (ii) We have no remarks on the proposals of the Foreign Office for dealing with the expulsion of aliens. (iv) We see no objection to the clause proposed in paragraph 8 of your letter to provide against the opening of a foreign bank. (v) We have no remarks on the proposal to be content with an Fnglish translation of the concession. 3. So far as concerns point (iii), we should, of course, have liked to see a transfer clause in the concession itself, on general grounds and more particularly as tho Political Agreement will not be backed, as in the case of earlier concessions, by an undertaking on the part of Sheikh. We note, however, that the company are extremely reluctant to propose any substantial modification of the concession for fear of causing the Sheikh to change his mind. We observe, also, that this view is shared by the other J. P. Gibson, Dsq. , INDIA OFFICE, S.W. 1. '-A* / ?. Z* 3765/39. M.03564/39. CONFIDENTIAL,2 . Departments concerned. In these circumstances and because no serious precedent seems likely to be created, we are prepared to agree to rest content with Clause 2 of the Political Agreement. 4. Por similar reasons we are willing to drop the idea, which we had at one time, of proposing that provision should be made in the concession itself for pipe-line and refinery facilities, and for the safeguarding of sites required for defence purposes. 5. Y/e have no comments on the draft Political Agreement for Abu Dhabi. The foregoing remarks hold good also for the Kalbj concession^Peel' s letter ?.Z. 675/39 of the 19th April) , in so far as they are applicable. There is presumably not the same risk of embarrassment in the event of an attempt to amend this concession, but in view of its relative unimportance, we do not demur to the omission of a transfer clause or of provision for ’’defence sites”. Y/e have no remarks on the question of the proper disposal of payments made to the Company, nor on the draft Political Agreement enclosed with Peel’s letter. /.

My dear Gibson, Would you please refer to Peel's letter P.Z. 675/39 of the 19th April, regarding the oil concession given to Petroleum Concessions Limited by Sheikh Khalid of Kalba? 2. We agree that His Majesty's Government’s approval of the concession should be deferred until Fowle has had an opportunity of discussing with the Sheikh the disposal of the income to be derived under the concession. If the result of this discussion is unsatisfactory, the question can be considered further. 3.

J.P.Gibson, bsq India Office, Whitehall (MINES DEPARTMENT), DEAN STANLEY STREET, MILLBANK, LONDON, S.W.l. 6th May, 1939. Dear Gibson, Your letter P.Z. 1608/39 of 15th April about the oil concession granted by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to Petroleum Concessions Limited. We agree that it is satisfactory that this concession has been secured. 2. As regards the Sheikhdoms of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter, we have now received India Office printed letter P.Z. 2382/39 of 20th April informing us that Petroleum Concessions Limited have now got a short-term concession over Ajman. This is all to the good. 3. On the points raised in paragraph 4 of your letter under reply, our observations are as follows:- (i) The Agreement omits to provide for a royalty on natural gas. All we can say is that the Sheikh forgoes a possible advantage - though, as a matter of fact, sales on natural gas on any scale have not so far taken place in the Persian Gulf oilfields. The agreement is for a long term, 75 years, and it would certainly seem, therefore, to have been in the Sheikh* s advantage to have provided for a natural gas royalty; (the rate in Article 5(e) of the Debai Agreement v/as 2 annas per 1,000 cubic feet) • Possibly the point could be covered in an exchange of letters, but we should not object if you let sleeping dogs lie. (ii) We have no observations. (iii) We would have preferred the Agreement to have included a transfer clause on the lines of Clause 21 &gt; of/ S.W.l.of the Dehai Agreement (see paragraph 4(e) of Powle’s letter P.Z.776/39 of 26th January). But Article 2 of the draft Political Agreement certainly goes a long way to meeting the point, and we agree that it would he dangerous to re-open this question on the Concession Agreement at this stage. (iv) This is not really a point for the Petroleum Department, hut we agree with the line taken in paragraph 8 of your letter, and in particular with your proposed addition to the Political Agreement. (v) T &amp;e have no observations. 4. As regards the Concession Agreement generally, we quite agree with the line taken in paragraph 5 of your letter that it is highly undesirable to risk re-opening difficult issues by suggesting modifications at this stage. 5. We are glad to see that the question of the Political .agreement is in hand and we have no observations on the draft enclosed in your letter, except to note that the subsidiary company. Petroleum Department (Trucial Coast) Limited, is a party to the Agreement rather than Petroleum Concessions Limited as in previous cases. I have no doubt there was a good reason for this. 6 .

IS I agree generally with Weightman. My comments are as follows! (a) I think it is satisfactory in principle that the Company ha/e succeeded in obtaining a concession to cover Kalba territory# (b) in paragraph 4 (l) of Weightma^s Express Letter N 0 .C/592 of 1st September 1938 to the India Office, Weightman agreed as / (Signature) M:Vb£\ j **. ia. S. 44. MFP—1048 S&amp;P—&lt;M.2042)—17-12-37—20,000. Designation) q j AN INDIA OFFI0E- 2 - as Officiating Political Resident that aTiy made with Ehalid must be solely in the latter’s capacity as guardian of the minor Shaikh ol Kalb a* The present agreement made by Longrigg does not allow for this, and I think that, in order that the whole agreement should not be vitiated, the preamble of the agreement must be altered on the lines suggested by Weightman in paragraph 3 of his letter under refer ence. A further point is that as the preamble reads now it seems to me that the agreement will only remain in force while Khalid is Regent, that is to say for another six years until the Shaikh attains his maj ority, (c) I note that the agreement was concluded at Ajman# This in rny opinion is unfortunate as opportunity should have been afforded for the Kalba notables to express their views according to Arab custom. I am afraid, therefore, that the circumstances under which the agreement was actually made may appear to the inhabit suits of Kalba as somewhat dubious, unless Khalid indeed gave them previous information of the proposed agreement. (d) a most important point is, how is Khalid going to dispose of the money paid to him by the Company? He should of course pay it into the Kalba State on whose behalf he as Regent has received it. He will quite possibly in point of fact put it into his own pocket. His Majesty’s Government are not perhaps strictly responsible for hoy/ Khalid disposes of the money he receives /-3 receives from the Company, but in local opinion inside Kalba and outside it His Majesty^ Government will certainly be held morally responsible for guard ing the interests of the minor Shaikh, and his State# ii until I am satisfied therefore that these interests have been safeguarded I suggest that His Majesty’s M Government do not concur in the present agreement. (e) With regard to the territory as defined in Article 1 of the agreement, this coincides with His Majesty’s Government’s instructions - vide paragraph 1 of India Office letter No*P.Z.6232/38, dated the 28th Septem ber 1938* Khalid himself owns no territory, with the possible exception of Dhaid, to which the Shaikh of Sharjah can lay claim* In this connection see para graph 5 of Longrigg’s letter to his Company dated the 20th December 1938* (f) In addition to the preamble, dealt with in (b) above, Khalid has signed the agreement as Ruler of Kalba# This designation should be changed on the lines suggested Weightman in paragraph 3 of his letter under reference. (g) There is no Article similar to Article 21 of the Debai agreement concerning transfer, and unless I am mistaken Weightman*s views on this point (vide his paragraph 4 (b)) do not appear to cover an important point at issue, as the agreement at present stands there is nothing to prevent Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. from transferring the concession to, say, an Anerioan Company. I am of the opinion, therefore /therefore, that an Article should be inserted limiting the transfer of the agreement to a British Company. (h) In regard to the Bank (Weightman's paragraph 4 (c)). I think that a similar proriso should be inserted in the Xalba agreement as is in the Debai agreement. (i) It win be noticed that there is no provision that the agreement shall be subject to the approval of His of Majesty’s Government. In view however corres pondence ending with your telegram No. 19 of 3rd January I do not think that we need insist on this point. 3. With regard to Article 4 of the agreement. I agree with Weightman that this clause should have formed the subject of a separate letter; as, however, it is in essence merely a promise of general help by Khalid to the Company in their negotiations I think it might be allowed to stand. I have no doubt, as Weightman points out, that the agreement is perhaps as much to secure the personal friendship of Shaikh Khalid to the Company as to cover the prospect of an oil field in Kalba. Personally I rather doubt whether Khalid’s friendship is as valuable an asset as Longrigg appears to think, but that is a matter for the company. 4. It would, of course, have been much better if Longrigg had consulted us as to the details of this agreement before actually concluding it. The only course now, it seems to me, is for His Majesty’s Government to inform the Company that until the points dealt with above have been settled.

It will be observed that, as br* Longrigg states, the wording of the concession has been considerably simpli fied in many places, in comparison with the standard form of concession hitherto used, and for essy reference X attach to this letter a schedule showing variations between the Dubai Concession and the present agreement. I need only draw attention here to three pointsj- (a) Article 4 scarcely eeoms to me to be appropriate in its present place and might more properly have been included in an exchange of covering letters, Nevertheless 1 see no reason for strong objection to it, (b) There is no article in the K&amp;lba Agreement corres ponding to Article 21 in the Dubai Concession, in regard to transfer. The present concession has been signed on behalf of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited instead of Petroleum Concessions Limited (v/hioh is pre sumably unobjectionable) and consequently no transfer provision is necessary. Indeed it is an advantage that the concession does not include provision for transfer to any other company, (c) Thors is no provision equivalent to Article 26 of the Dubai Concession in regard to a bank. It follows that not/-not only will His Majesty 1 a Government be unable to prevent the establishment of a vfholcly foreign bank but also the Company itself will have no influence over the lhaikh in the selection of the bank. In this connection s reference Is invited to paragraph ? of your demi-official letter No# C/4.27 dated the 6 th Jhly 1938 to the India Office. 5 . Subject to consideration of the points mentioned above y I recommend that the Company be informed that the concession, after amendment in respect of the designation of Shaikh Khslid, is approved by His Majesty’s Government, and that I should bo authorised to make a similar communi cation to Shaikh Khalid on behalf of the ahaikh of Kalba. Sd/- H. Weightman. Political Agent, Bahrain.from Bahrain. 463 Copy of letter dated Dubai, 21st Decembe' 1938, Stephen H. Lon^rigg to the Political Agent.* I have pleasure in forwarding to you herewith a translated copy of an Agreement concluded yesterday between the Company and the Regent of Kalbah. I send also a copy of a letter addressed by me to my London principals, Indicating certain points connected with the Agreement. In assessing both the territories and the degree of influence of Shaikh Khalid, I have had the advantage of the advice of the Residency Agent, Sharjah. As it was ascertained from the India Office some weeks ago that no objection would be felt to the Company obtaining these rights from the Shaikh of Kalbah, and as the form of the document follows closely that already approved by H.M.G., without any new features of which I can anticipate their disapproval, I hope that H.M.G. will be able shortly to signify that the present Concession may be considered as fully in force.COPY DUBAI TRUCIAL COAST December 20th, 1938. Petroleum Concessions I.td. London. After a number of conversations between the under signed and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed of Kalbah, all held at Ajman where the Shaikh is staying, an Agreement was signed today between him and the Company. This Agreement is forwarded to you herewith in the Arabic original, with an English translation, An Arabic original remains with the Shaikh, and translations are being sent to our Bahrain office and to the Political Agent, Bahrain. The necessary funds for the payments specified are being xrai; obtained from the Eastern Bank, Karachi, by Air, as in the case of the recent Ras al Khaimah agreement. It will be observed that the now Agreement follows closely the lines of previous Concessions on the Trucial Coast. A quantity of unessential matter has been omitted, and the wording simplified in certain places. Efforts were made to ensure that the Shaikh understood what he was signing, but large parts did not appear to interest him. He was resolute only about obtaining f, the same as Sharjah and Dubai'. This, generally speaking, he has done. Article 4 is new, and emphasises that the Shaikh is a man of outstanding personality, and likely to be of real value to the Company in its future efforts to obtain access to dif ficult areas. He is the oldest, and the most personally influential, of the tTuwasim rulers, although his own terri tory is small. It extends from the boundary between the Muscat territories at Murair and the Shumaliyah, to a point near Dibah at the north end of the Shumaliyah, omitting cer tain villages which have an independent status. He claims to be paramount over a good part of the mountain country behind/-■■■■■■■■■■■ - 2 - behind thst coast, and to be able to influence tribes well outside his own country. The village of Dhaid is his. The pa.yments to be made on and after the discovery of commercial oil are the same as those provided in the Dubai and Sharjah Concessions. So also is the official payment on first signature; but the 'unofficial payments' 45000 in the case of Dubai and Fs 55000 in that of Sharjah) are not to be made, there will be one motor car to be given instead of two, and it is hoped to keep the inevitable presents to the 3haikh f s relations within reasonable limits. The annual sum payable with effect from a ye&lt;;r hence, is to be fe 24000 instead of Fs 30000 at Dubai, and &amp; 40000 at Sharjah.In the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful THIS Agreement was concluded at Ajman on the 27th day of Shuwwal 1357 A.H*, corresponding to the 20th day of December 1938 A.D., between His Hbccellency Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad bin Sultan, Be,gent of Kalbah (hereinafter called 'the Shaikh'), of the one part, and Mr. Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, General Manager of Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd.

Dear Mr. Gibson, I enclose, for the information of the India Office, a copy of an Agreement executed on the 20th December, 'whereby the Regent of Kalbah has granted to P.D. (Trucial Coast) Ltd. an oil concession for a period of 75 years from the date of signature. The official payment on first signature, and the payments to be made on and after the discovery of com mercial oil, are the same as those provided in the Dubai and Sharjah concessions, but the annual sum payable as from a year hence will be Rs.24,000 instead of Rs.30,000 at Dubai and Rs.40,000 at Sharjah. The Agreement is somewhat simpler than previous Agreements, certain unessential matter having been omitted. Longrigg writes 'Article 4 is new, and emphasises that the Shaikh is a man of outstanding personality, and likely to be of real value to the Company in its future efforts to obtain access to difficult areas. He is the oldest, and the most personally influential, of the Juwasim rulers, although his own territory is small. It extends from the boundary between the Muscat terri tories (at Murair) and the Shumailiyah, to a point near Dibah at the north end of the Shumailiyah, omitting certain villages which have an independent status. He claims to be paramount over a good part of the mountain country behind that coast, and to be able to influence tribes well outside his own country. The village of Dhaid is his.' Yours sincerely.

POL DEPt. 5 SEP 1938 INDIA OFFJC 2. The information from Bahrain quoted in Petroleum Concessions Limited’s letter is substantially correct. There is little doubt that Shaikh Khalid does dream of the day when the whole of the qawasimi territories will be re-united under one Shaikh, that Shaikh being himself. The inhabitants of the Wadi al Halu and the Wadi al Qaur have taken oath of allegiance to him and he has promised to protect them and to assist them in any way possible, but has informed them that for the present they must remain under their respective Shaikhs (i.e. Sharjah and Has al Khaimah), until the end of the diving season. Similarly Fujairah has taken oath of allegiance to/ {Signature) Designation)■MMBi rr - 2 - to him, though Shaikh Khalid has told Shaikh Saif bin Hamad that he should continue to exercise his authority “until better arrangements can be made“# In regard to Diba (Hasn) the present Shaikh is completely incapable, and the local expecta tion is that Shaikh Khalid will appoint a Wali to act under his own direct orders. 3. Hitherto Shaikh Khalid has acted with considerable circumspection and, whether from conviction or from shortage of funds, he has made no effort to extend his influence by forceful methods. At present he is universally popular and there is every possibility of his influence extending much more widely during the coming cold weather. 4. With regard to the specific questions raised by Petroleum Concessions Limited, I have the following comments t o make: (1) I see no objection to their approaching the Regent at Kalba in the same manner as the other Trucial Coast Eulers, but pending further developments they should deal with him solely as the guardian of the minor Shaikh of Kalba. (2) No general sanction should be given in the terms stated by the Company. Presumably their immediate object is to obtain access to Jebel Paiyah through the good offices of Shaikh Khalid, and conceivably this will be the ultimate solution. Nevertheless this particular question, (and all similar questions) must be considered fully on its merits. I shall be addressing you separately regarding Jebel Paiyah. (3) It is essential to draw a clear distinction between Shaikh /© 0 Sh a iVh Khalid as Regent of Kalba and Shaikh Khalid as the potential Ruler of a combined Qawassmii Shaikhdom. At the moment Petroleum Concessions Limited can only deal with him in his former capacity and a Kalba concession would therefore cover only recognised Kalba territory and not the whole of the Shumaliyah. 5 # Petroleum Concessions Limited would do well to confirm their friendly relations with Shaikh Khalid. sd.

Sellers i. Skliros PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED - i/ PC. 28/95 CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON ' • 25th July, 19^8. E.C.2 Dear Mr. Peel, When this Company first went concession hunting on the Trucial Coast, it was decided provisionally not to approach the Shaikh of Kalba - who was at that time on the point of being recognised by H.M.G. as a separate unit - on the grounds that his territory was so situated as to have no oil interest. It does not seem certain, however, that this was a wise decision since Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, seems to be a man of some personality who, besides controlling a considerable area of mountain territory, seems to possess influence on the Western side of the mountains also. In this connection the following passage occurs in a report dated May 10th 19^8 from Bahrain:- K* /? sy £ &gt;/&gt; kl - *-£- 'The R.A. informs me that Khalid, the regent of Kelba, has managed to get Fujairah and Dibah under his control. That is to say, they have sworn allegiance to him. This means that practically the whole of the Shamailyah is now dependent on Kelba. At the same time Wadi A1 Qor and Wadi Helu, sometimes known as Wadi Ham, have both recently paid tax to Khalid, instead of to Sheikh*Sultan bin Salem as heretofore. Wadi Helu runs southwards from Khatt and joins Wadi A1 Qor in the vicinity west of the town of Kelba. Khalid has owned Dhaid for some time. It is believed that Khalid T s intentions are to re-unite the Qawasim territories in one sheikhdom under his own control. If Khalid is allowed to continue he might eventually succeed as he is universally liked. I called on Khalid several2 0 times during last Ramadan at Ajman, and afterwards cured him of malaria with Atebrin. He seemed a nice type of man and has sent me many messages since then. At the moment it looks as if Ras A1 Khaimah territory is now practically halved. Khalid is also friendly with the Bani Chittab. At the moment H.M.G. are taking no action as regards Khalid's activities, although^they are fully aware of the progress he is making.” I write now to ask: 1. Whether you feel any objection to our approaching the Regent of Kalba in the same manner as other Trucial rulers if the local situation seems to call for this: 2. Whether you have any objection to our approaching, through him, tribes or places which one of the other Qasawim rulers has claimed or may claim^if he offers us more effective assistance than they: 3 . Whether, in your opinion, a concession from the Regent of Kalba can be taken as coveringthe whole of the Shumaliyah which of course includes Fujairah,Dibah and other villages.
