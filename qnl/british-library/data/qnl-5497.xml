V, The following duties devolve upon the motor cycle despatch rider;- fa) Collection from and posting of mails at the post office. There is no'house delivery system in Bahrain. (b) Collection from, and delivery at, the office of Messrs. Cable and Wireless, of telegrams. Messrs Cable and Wireless do not deliver telegrams to addressees residing outside the Manama Municipal area. ^ p A (c) Delivery of local mails to the various firms, Bahrain Petroleum Company, R.A.F.* Banks, etc., and, not infrequently, making arrangements for the shipment and clearance of goods from Messrs. Gray Mackenaie and Customs. 3. fo Hows The distances (single) :- involved in the above Journeys are as Agency.3 Miles Post Office...... 4 Miles Cable and Wireless •••• 4 Miles Bazaar.............................. 4 Miles Bahrain Petroleum Company..... .13 Miles R.A.F. station Muharraq............. 6 Miles Gray Mackenzie &amp; Bank etc.• 4 Miles 4. The above duties are more than can be effectively performed on one motor cycle. Urgent meesages have frequently to be delayed owing to the absence of despatch rider on prior business or sent by staff car, an uneconomicial method which also interferes with the legitimate work of this vehicle, already sufficiently heavy. Furthermore the existing machine has proved incapaole of withstanding the strain of such constant use on the bad roads of Bahrain. It is constantly out of action for petty repairs and it is likely that it will need early replacement by a more efficient vehicle. Proposals to this effect will, if necessary, be submitted to the Government of India xx sepatately. 5. ' The cost of new motor cycle will be approximately Rs.2000/- and can be met by re-appropriation within the sanctioned budget grant for the current financial year* 6. It is requested that early sanction may be accorded to the purchase of the new motor cycle. -REPGU-/ GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

At present there are two Government curing car end a Dodge Station wagon. The former is intended for the use of the Political Resident and the Station Wagon for miscellaneous office duties. 2. The offices and houses of the Residency staff are scattered over an area/ of more than 14 square miles and are connected by exceptionally bad roads which are now in a worse state of repair than they were in the year 1924. During the last eighteen months the two Government cars have had to be employed for many duties on bad roads for which they v*ere not originally intended and they are now frequently laid up for repairs. The delay experienced in securing spare parts makes the position even more difficult, and at the present moment the Buick car is only rendered mobile by the loan of a battery from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3* One of the heaviest calls on these cars is the frequent trips which they have to make along an execrable road to the aerodrome which is six miles from the Residency. It is on occasion necessary to send these cars several times in one day to bring guests, air crews and their baggage to the Residency where they are normally accommodated. During the first half of this month nine aeroplanes arrived and left the Bushire aerodrome necessitating twenty three trips. When aircraft call at Bushire the Government cars cannot be used for the purposes for which they were purchased and this has frequently resulted in the dislocation of office work. Had not Residency officers also lent their own cars for use on this bad road it would not have been possible to carry on with the existing arrangements for so long. 4. In addition to trips to the aerodrome the miscellaneous duties which the Dodge Station wagon undertakes include the following (a) Transport of clerical staff from theqr quarters to office •at night to deal with urgent telegrams. ThisEssential as the clerical staff receive no night duty allowance while among our temporary staff there are now four women clerks. (b) Transport of Government clerical staff and baggage from Sabzabad or the Town office to the quay and vice versa . includes the transport of the confidential office and staff whe(i the Hobble the Political Resident proceeds on and returns tour. rn - (d) Transport of official visitors who arrive by sea or air w&amp; m the Buick is not available. This has occured several times ’4u ^ing the last six months when there have been as many as eleven ^ guests accommodated at the Residency. Transport-to such occasions ' ke s only been possible by borrowing officers' private cars. r~j 2 (e) official visitors often require a car to be placed at m tl: eir disposal during their stay in Bushire, as is done elsewhere and it has frequently been found necessary to borrow the cars of Residency Officeiy for this purpose. While they are naturally (c) Transport of farrashes or clerks with urgent mail bags packages from Bushire to Sabzabaa and from the/tr^on office to quay.prepared to accommodate their friends Ithdrfe is ho reason why they should be called upon to make' good the absence of cars which should be provided by Government* 5© K The expansion of the Residency*s activities and the resulting increase in clerical staff have unfortunately coincided with the disappearance from Bushire of the last reliable taxis© Prior to 1941 it was still possible to hire a taxi for the journey from Bushire to Sabzabad at a cost of Rs»2/~« The present charge for this trip in one of the few remaining decrepit vehiclesj which are more often than not to be seen stranded at the side of the road, is now Rs* 20 /-. t Apart from the exorbitant cost, their insanitary condition • and the risk of their breaking down renders it impossible to utilise these taxis either for the transport of guests who arrive by air or sea, or for any other purpose* 6* It is difficult not to compare the shortage of transport for essential Residency work at Bushire, where there are no mobile bus or lorry Services, with the vehicles available to personnel 6t the oil companies, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, the host of wartime organizations in Persia, and the services, itfhen the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation was established in Bushire a motor vehicle^ was invariably allotted to their four Indian clerks who used it whenever they wished both in and out of office hours. In contrast the Residency has a ministerial staff of twenty seven while the Dodge Station v/agon on the rare occasions when it is free from strictly office duties, is the only vehicle^ available. In Abadan the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company run regular bus services throughout the refinery and residential areas and their clerical staff is transported to and from office both in the morning and evening and when the offices close for luncheon. I would also invite attention to paragraph 5 of the enclosure to my Express Letter Noe284~53/l04 dated the 30th January 1944(copy enclosed for easy reference)describing a state of affairs which is hardly consistent with the Residency*s shortage of transport. We have been able to carry on hitherto largely owing to the loan cf officers* private cars and I do not consider it is fair to expect them to continue to lend their cars in a country where the roads are so bad and cars depreciate sc rapidly, to make good a deficiency of Government vehicles* 7* I therefore recommend that two Station wagons be sanctioned for this Residency at a very early date. It seems possible that vehicles could be made available from lease-lend stocks in which case the cost would be considerably reduced. tl / Telegram No*A/810, dated the 6th(Recd*7th)May, 1944.

Charge d*Affaires at Bagdad which explains how five cars were requisitioned by the Sheikh of Koweit and gives an account of the Embassy 1 s unsuccessful efforts to obtain the release of a number of them for official purposes. As the cars were requisitioned at the instigation of the Embassy we feel that it would be a measure of ordinary justice to give full weight to the Embassy 1 s claims. But apart from that aspect of the matter there is an urgent need for cars at both posts for official purposes. Owing to the demands of the Army for houses in the vicinity, the Embassy staff cannot be accommodated near their offices, They have to work long hours, cannot use native public transport and are, accordingly, compelled to incur considerable expenses by the hire of taxis which are, moreover, extremely scarce. The car already available to the staff is insufficient to meet their requirements and the problem of transport has recently been further complicated by the withdrawal from service, owing to age and shortage of spares and tyres, of privately ov/ned cars.

His intention undoubtedly was subsequently to smuggle them into Iraq and sell to the highest bidder (one was actually offered to a member of my staff at over 100$ profit).

As you are aware the difficulty of obtaining cars here is enormous and hope was expressed that the Sheikh would agree to release two of the cars for Bagdad (purchase of one being sanctioned by your telegram No. 922 and the other being urgently required by Lord Glenconner's representative) and one for His Majesty's Consul at Basra whose need is most pressing. 3/ Political Resident Persian Gulf replied that two cars could certainly be made available, that the Sheikh wanted to keep two n as a reserve” and that he would like to retain one himself for a member of his staff. As cars were required in Bagdad for official purposes and could be driven overland (as opposed to shipping back to Bushire) His Majesty's Ambassador replied expressing the hope that Political Resident Persian Gulf would waive his claim or that he could persuade the Sheikh to release us one of his 0 4. Latest telegram from Political Resident Persian Gulf indicates that he has secured the release of a second car from the Sheikh but that he proposes to endow his secretary with one and his Vice-Consul with another. He states that they have been vainly trying to buy cars for the past year and that Government of India have recently refused to assist. Both these facts seem to me prima facie evidence that their needs are not particularly pressing and could surely be satisfied by sharing one vehicle. Certainly I should have thought they should not have been given precedence either over official organisations buying with public funds, or over His Majesty's Consul-General, Basra, It is moreover probably the case that the price payable for cars (based on the value declared for Koweit's customs) will be below their actual cost. And where governmental machinery has been used in this way it seems right that His Majesty's Government should reap the advantage. 5 ./...5. In point of fact we could do with a fourth car, as Public Relations Attach^ has received sanction to buy which . he is now endeavouring to do in India. I did not mention. . .this to Political Resident Persian Gulf as I did not want to appear too grasping. His present proposals however appear to me to run counter to public interests and I feel obliged to refer to His Majesty's Government for a decision. I have been compelled to refer this to you by telegram as an early decision is necessary before the cars are shipped to Bushire.

My Lord, With reference to your telegram No. 6 of the 10th January, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a fresh report on the Humber car supplied for the official use of His Majesty’s Legation. This report, like that enclosed in my despatch No. 542 of the 30th August, 1937, has been prepared by a representative of General Motors, Near East. 2. Your Lordship will observe that according to the enclosed report the broken side member of the chassis needs replacing by a complete new chassis, while the steering, suspen sion and brake drums require extensive repairs and replacements. As regards the engine, the report states that it badly needs re boring, while repairs are also necessary to the water pump, automatic radiator shutters, dynamo coupling and water temperat ure indicator. New exhaust pipes are also required throughout, while in the gear box new bearings on the main shaft are necessary. Other© necessary repairs include re-painting, upholstering of the rear compartment and complete r^-wiring of all electrical equipment. August 1937, when the car was last tested. It has now covered 36,427 miles and in view of its age and its present oil and petrol consumption of only 180 and 8.9 miles per gallon respectively, I submit that it should be replaced by a new car. Many of these repairs were necessary as long ago as /1 The hight Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G. , G.C.S.I., G.C.

If sanction is given I should he grateful if I might he informed hy telegraph, since it is desirable that if a new car is purchased, it should if possible be delivered in time for the festivities in connexion with the forthcoming marriage of His Imperial Highness the crown prince to princess Fowzieh of igypt.

As I mentioned to you by telephone, two points of difficulty have emerged. So far as we can gather, the Ford van, which it is now desired to replace, was used mainly for the transport of staff between Sabzabad and the Town office, and the 1932 correspondence suggests that it is one of two cars. When we go to Treasury we shall have, of course, to be able to say that this new car is necessary. It would help us if you could indicate (1) the number of persons requiring to be transported and the frequency of their movements; (2) that no alternative means of transport exists. We have, of course, in mind the possibility that J.P. Gibson, Esq. r&amp;So. i &gt;£ 1 . her'?. 1f!

It is unfortunate that the condition of the existing Ford vanette of the Bushire Residency was not brought to the notice of the Government of India earlier. They are, however, of opinion that if it has been possible to carry on with it so far, it should hot be very difficult to do so a little longer. It is accordingly requested that the proposal for the purchase of a new motor vanette should be submitted as a new item for inclusion in the budget estimates for 1939-40, when it will be considered along with other similar proposals.

If it would meet your point, perhaps it would be sufficient to issue the draft to the Foreign Office to which Joint Political and Special Finance Committee agreed, with the omission of the word ’’Ford” in the first paragraph, and then suggest to the Government of India and the Political Resident by telegram that it might be preferable, m the interests of oromoting istfc; British trade, to purchase a CVf 9crW tc '$ Hillman car, if that would equally meet-tea-requirements. I understand that the Foreign Office and Treasury are not likely to take much objection to the small additional cost which would apparently be involved in the substitution of a British for an American car.TELEPHONES:- GPOSVENOR 3-401 UO LINES' CA B l_E S - R O OTE SMOTI, LONDON.

I am also enclosing some catalogues giving particulars of 1933 HILLMAN ’’Wizards’ and would like to mention that these cars are giving most satisfactory service in all parts of the world. Quite a large number of them are in use in Iraq and India. We can also supply this chassis fitted with a van type body with two seats in front, or alternatively, could arrange for the cushions and squabs to come out of both the Tourer and the Saloon, so that luggage and kit could be carried in the back of the car^ although of course a luggage grid is fitted at the back.G.
