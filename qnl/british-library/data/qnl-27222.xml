The book is arranged in two parts, the first on horticulture, and the second on animal husbandry. The part on horticulture opens with general topics, such as water, soil, and plant diseases. This is followed by sections on grains similar to wheat; nutritious roots; thick, rounded roots; legumes; plants that yield oils for lighting and other industrial uses; plants used for making rope, twine, and cloth; plants used as dyes; plants from which wine is extracted; sugar-bearing plants; fruit trees; trees that yield edible oils; trees with leaves that have industrial uses; annual and perennial herbs; and so on. The first part concludes with taxonomy; a temperature chart in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Réaumur; and captions for the illustrations, all of which appear at the end of the book. Part two begins with Georges Cuvier’s classification of the animal kingdom (vertebrata, mollusca, articulata, and radiata). Practical topics discussed include: the raising of ungulates; domesticated birds; fish and fish farming; apiculture; sericulture; mammalian pests; avian pests; harmful insects; hunting; wine and beer making; and the operation of mills. The final sections of the book deal with the treatment of human diseases in the absence of a doctor.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Hunting</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Lebanon</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Domestic animal</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fruit tree</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil and fat</topic></subject><subject><topic>Dyes and dyeing</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Beirut</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Agriculture</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wine</topic></subject><subject><topic>Beer</topic></subject><subject><topic>Disease</topic></subject><subject><topic>Animal Classification</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/12910#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
