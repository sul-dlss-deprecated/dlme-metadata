The plan to establish an RAF squadron at Bahrain was precipitated by the relocation of Squadron 203 from Basra to Aden, with Bahrain identified as a practical central base for the protection of the Persian Gulf. The correspondence discusses: plans to expand the existing aerodrome at Muharraq; questions over whether customs should be paid by the RAF in Bahrain, as charged by the Bahrain Government; the proximity of property owned by Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah to the site proposed for acquisition; the cost of the acquisition of land; and arrangements for the construction of the RAF base. Enclosed in the file are three blueprint maps showing the proposed areas for acquisition and development at Muharraq, in relation to local properties and villages (folios 104a-106).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Muharraq, British airbase</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00008e#share">Non-commercial use only</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00008e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
