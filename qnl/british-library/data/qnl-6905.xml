From Foreign Office to Sir R. Wingate, No. 1472, dated Srd Decethher 19.1 S'. Chief Political Officer at Baghdad has suggested that when Turkish Government abandon teiupoial soveiei^nty over Iraq they should at the same time renounce all claim to spiritual sovereignty, for example, in regard to pre-war functions of Sheikh-ul-Islam. I should be glad to receive your general observations on this proposal, and also information as to the practical jurisdiction, if any, of the Sheikh-ul-Islam in kgypt, and whether question has ever been opened or mentioned in any document. From Sir E. Wingate to Foreign Office, No. 189 (? 4), dated 17th December 1918. Office of Sheikh-ul-Islam does Hot exist in Egypt, although the title was given colloquially to Rector of Azhar University, an Egyptian appointment. After the grant of autonomy to Mahomet All Pasha, the idea prevailed that the appointment of cadis for Egypt was reserved to the Sultan of Turkey, There was apparently no written authority for this idea, which was disputed by-Ismail Pasha ; but since 1890 appointment of Grand Cadi has been made by the Sultan. Nury Effendi, last Grand Cadi, arrived in 1912 with firman which was subsequently registered in Egypt. He left this country in 1914 on the outbreak of war with Turkey, since when the functions of Grand Cadi have been discharged by the two Egyptian cadis. Eormal renunciation of all claims.to spiritual authority by the Sultan of Turkey would seem to involve his relinquishment of Caliphate ; and to press for this might be regarded as a contravention of our principle of not interfering in religious matters. Never theless we should, I consider (? offer, omitted) firm resistance, and if necessary obtain guarantees against, all actual manifestations of this authority—whether by appoint ment and confirniation of cadis or otherwise—in non-Turkish territories. NOTE BY D R . T. W. ARNOLD, C.I.E., L ITT .D. The difficulty stated in this telegram would appear to be based on a misunder standing as to the position of the Caliph in the Muhammadan world and the nature of the office of the Shaikh-ul-Islam. The Caliphate represents an ideal of the unity of the whole body of Muslims. According to theory, the Caliph is the successor (or, representative) of Muhammad in all his functions, governmental and religious (except that of the prophetic mission, which is held to have ceased with the life of Muhammad himself). The duties of the Caliph are defined by Mawardi (a great Muslim jurist who died in 1058), as follows :— (a) The defence of the faith, (b) the decision of legal disputes, (c) the preservation of public safety, (d) the punishment of wrong-doers, (e) the defence of the frontiers, (/) warring against those who refuse to accept Islam or to submit to Muslim rule, (g) the collection and administration of taxes, (h) the payment of salaries, (i) the appointment of competent officials, and (j) personal attention to the details of government. These principles, of course, represent only an ideal, and in practice most of these functions were delegated to officials who by theory were supposed to derive their authority from the Caliph. , . • p In all this there is no reference to any spiritual authority, nor m fact has the Caliph ever possessed any spiritual authority whatsoever. Muslim technology makes the same distinctions between secular, religious and spiritual, as are current in Europe, and the corresponding words dunyawl, dim, and ruhanl are found in Arabic, Persian and Turkish. As in Christian literature, so in Islamic literature, the W ord ' spirit ' (ruh) is used in two distinct references, (i) psychological, for the 10 OT 24, 200 12/18 .. ... ■ :■'vv• &gt;v■ :, m I through a false analogy with the in )1 V_ 111 lt5LltlUlt V , 'i-i' i i , But such comparisons arc enluc'/ O [ /11.11Uclx ci li til Ul 1 iv vyj. v ^ l could such a phrase be employed, and it has only - . +1., ' c j,,,]. ] r i^ ' • ^ ^ - -istitutions of Christianity, and the ( alipJIJia.-, P ^ ^ ti truth ; he can promulgate no religious uugmc*, v^. v.vv .. — — ' ~ v sacerdotal function , his relation to rciigini) is sometimes been compared with the Tope, c^cc. j-,- ' misleading, for the Caliph has at no time been held to be the depositon of bw^. ■ ■ ■ ' ' dogma, or even issne a definition ol one; he cannot forgive sins or exercise any saccx^wuc** , — merely that of a protector Any spiritual powers that have ever been claiinpd to exist in the Muslim world have been attributed to the prophets or to a very lew ol the greatest saints, but never to the Caliph. A somewhat similar misunderstanding of the jViuhanimadan position m regard to the relation between religion and the State is found in a number of European books. Accustomed to the clear distinction between civil law as administered by the State, and ecclesiastical law as administered by spiritual authorities, Kuropean writers have assumed that a similar distinction exists in the Muhammadan world. But here too all analogies with the institutions of Christian Lurope fail, for according to Muhammadan theory the sources of civil, administrative and religious law are the same. The Quran and trhe Simnah (supplemented by the consensus «-f the 'ulama and by analogical deduction) are decisive in matters of civil law jis much as in matters of faith and dogma. The Muhammadan law (the sharl'at), being based upon [he revealed Word of God, demands the obedience of the Caliph himself, and if the Caliph offends against the precepts of this law, he can be deposed, as was done in the case of Selim 111.(1808), Abd-ul-Aziz (1876} and Abd-ul-l lainid (1009). The necessary authorisation for such a deposition was in each case given in a fatwa issued by the mufti of Constantinople, the Shaikh-ul-Islam. Accordingly, the position of the Sliaikh-nl-Islam has no parallel in Christian Europe, where he has often (like the Caliph) erroneously been described as a kind of Muhammadan Pope and as possessed of spiritual authority. Islam has no priesthood and the only equivalent to a body of clergy in the Muhammadan world is the ulama (or, learned). Among the 4 ulama, some specialise on matters of dogma and ntual, others on civil law. In regard to the latter class, the judicial system of the i uhanimadan state has generally laid down a clear distinction between (a) the cadi (qadi, qazi) and (6) the mufti ; (a) The cadi is concerned with distributive justice ; he is a magistrate appointed to administer the law and pronounce sentence in cases brou dit before him, both civil and criminal; he is a government official, appointed l,v the ruler and dismissible at will; and, as such. Lis decisions are-sone times given, not m accordance with the sharl'at, but in ncn.rdaure wi h the customs of the country or the will of the ruler. ('&gt;) The mufti is concerned with consultative justice • he is a inri^t formal legal opinions on questions submitted to Lib by a iiiViMi4' U ' S by a private individual; on the basis nf snph m • • a 1 nia g ls1, /de or may decide a case, or the imtidud may egulate his've, position is much like that of a legal reniembi ric T' r e ' nople Le exercises a function similar to what in tlVe r •/''i Q' Stantl ' America is the highest office of the Supreme Court-th 0t r defending the Constitution.

The Shaikh-ul-Islam and the Grand Vizier took 'rank as the two highest functionaries of the Empire, and were the only officials who were invested by the Sultan m person ; bnt just as he was appointed by the Saltan, so the bhaikh-uWstam might bp degraded from his high office and sent into exile In snite ot the deference paid to his opinion, he is nevertheless a functionary of the Turkish Orovernment, dependent for his appointment and continuance in office on the goodwill ot the Sultan. The various legislative reforms during the 19th century have con- siderably climmished his power and influence, by establishing courts of law in which the shan'at is not administered ; and under the present Turkish Government the sphere of his influence has been still more narrowed. But it is noteworthy that while the Turkish Government has been clipping the authority of the Shaikh-ul-Tslam within Turkish dominions, they have endeavoured in treaties with Christian Powers to magnify his oihce, c . q ., (V x ) the Austrian Government m 190iJ agreed that the President of the Curia of the 'ulama who control Muslim ecclesiastical affairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina should, after having been appointed by the Kino- Emperor, receive a diploma of investiture from the Shaikh-ul-Islam in Con stantinople; (6) the Italian Government, in the treaty of Lausanne (19] 2), agreed that the chief cadi of Libya should be nominated by the Shaikh-ul-lslamat in Constantinople ; (c) the Bulgarian Government, in the treaty of Constantinople (1913), agreed that the chief mufti should receive from the Shaikh-ul-lslamat authorisation lor the performance of his functions, but this chief mufti is to be elected by the Muftis of Bulgaria from among their own number; the other muftis are to be elected by the Muhammadan electors of Bulgaria, but when the chief mufti has satisfied himself that anj^ mufti so elected possesses all the characteristics required by the sharl'at he is to inform the Shaikh-ul-lslamat of the need of an authorisation for the issue of fatwas, and hand over to the new mufti the diploma so obtained; the heudjets or judgments delivered by the muftis shall be submitted to ihe scrutiny of the Shaikh-ul-lslamat, if the persons interested so demand ; (d) the Greek Govern ment, in the treaty of Constantinople (1913), agreed that the chief niufti should receive his investiture from the Shaikh-ul-lslamat, but he is to be nominated by the King of Greece out of three candidates elected by an electoral body made up of all the muftis of Greece ; the subordinate muftis are to be elected by the Muhammadan electors, and are to receive from the chief mufti the authorisation to issue fatwas, in accordance with a diploma from the Shaikh ul-Islamat conferring on the chief mufti the right to authorise the subordinate muftis. It is noteworthy that in the treaties with the Italian, Bulgarian and Greek Governments, the authorisation is to come, not from the Shaikh-ul-Islam, but from the Shaikh-ul-Islamat, i.e., a Government department. These agreements imply an assumption of temporal authority on the part of the Sultan of Turkey, which neither the British Government in India, nor the French Government in Algeria would ever tolerate. In Algeria, I understand that the cadis are still .appointed by the French Government, and in India they were appointed by ) the British Government until the passing of Act-XI. of 1864 (when official appoint^ ments wore abolished), and there are many Muhammadans in India who would wish the British Government to resume this function. It is therefore a matter of importance that if Turkish sovereignty over Mesopo tamia ceases, the Shaikh-ul-Islam should at the same time cease to exercise authority there. The Shaikh-ul-Islam is an official of the Turkish Government, appointed by the Sultan in his capacity as Sultan, not as Caliph, and this designation was bestowed upon the mufti of Constantinople before the Sultan himself assumed the title of Caliph. He has never exercised authority outside Turkish dominions until the 20th century, and this assumption of authority has come about (as pointed out above) through a misunderstanding that he possesses spiritual authority, either of his own or through his connection with the Sultan as Caliph, As Sir Reginald Wingate points out in his telegram, the title'Shaikh-ul-Islam has also been given to the mufti of the Azhar in Cairo ; it used also to be given to' the mufti in Damascus. There are muftis in Mecca, whose judgments in matters of religious law have always received more consideration in the Muhammadan world ihan those of the mufti of Constantinople; there are also muftis in India and other parts of the Muhammadan world. The independence of the mufti, as an exponent ofthe religious law, has always been a 1o Kmlti'a Warn; but it has beeu part of the P°^: i f u 4 U1 a ,V s ,e„/outBide Turkish donmuons ^hXw f o 7 of Muslim jurisprudence, but wtll provu o occ ter:KT f n ,^ mufti of Constantinople) renounce » 1 ° &gt; , r iu t he mosques for the bultau as no obstacle to the people olMesopotau.ia 1 . o him as fuliph, even Caliph, just as at present the ud.au M ^rnmadans p though he exercises no jurisdiction in India noi uoe m TTT A , .

' Even amongst the Moslem peoples placed under the direct government of European ' States a tendency prevails to be considered in some way or another subjects ot the Sultan-Khalif.' Some scholars explain this phenomenon by the spiritual character which the dignity of Khalif is supposed to have acquired during the later Abbasids, and retained since that time, until the Ottoman princes combined it again with the temporal dignity of sultan. According to this view the later Abbasids were a sort of Popes of Islam ; while the temporal authority, in the central districts as well as in the subordinate kingdoms, was in the hands of various sultans. The Sultans of Constantinople govern, then, under this name, as much territory as the political vicissitudes allow them to govern, i.e., the Turkish Empire; as Knalifs, they are the spiritual heads of the w^hole Sunnite Islam. 1 hough this view, through the ignorance of European statesmen and diplomatists, may have found acceptance even by some of the great Powers, it is nevertheless entirely untrue; unless by 'spiritual authority' we are to understand the empty appearance of worldly authority. This appearance was all that the later Abbasids n^verpc ssr 1 ^ temi)0ra ^ P ower J spiritual authority of any kind they The spintual authority in Catholic Islam reposes in the legists, who in thisresriprt are called in a tradition the ' heirs of the prophets.'

The Caliph .has nothing that can be in any way compaied with this, and it is difficult to understand how the fable of the spiritual power of the Caliphs can have arisen, and how it could have been constantly extended further by scholars who are otherwise intelligent, though no one is able to say what these spiritual functions actually consist of ; for the appoint ment of judges and the conferring of high-sounding titles can certainly not be considered as such, III.—C. Snocck Huiigrokje : 'Kederland en de Islam ' {2d ed. Leiden, 1915), pp. 67-8, 70. Translation. —In the beginning, the Caliphs (as their name indicates) were the 'successors' of Mohammed, namely in the guidance and the government of the community. In proportion as the conquests of Islam were extended and firmly established, the Caliphate developed into a princely dynasty, which ruled over an empire and theoretically made claim to the governance of the whole world. We have already drawn attention to the deep roots this theory has struck in the system of Islam and in the popular notions of its adherents. Even after the political dismem berment, which quickly set in, had reached its furthest point, they still continued to cling to the fiction of the unity, and the Caliphs deprived of all real power remained the symbol of this unity, and at least set themselves with their diplomas to put the seal on whatever had come into existence outside their influence. In this fiction, however, the Caliphs kept the name of whatever their predecessors had been in reality ; they were called rulers of all the lands occupied by Islam, and never spiritual chiefs, whose interference was confined to specifically religious matters. The system had indeed been complete from about the 10th century, and its further application took place, just as before its first development, under the guidance of the learned ; no one expected it of the central authority, whether real or fictitious. Neither Muslim statesmen, scholars or laymen have ever seen in the Caliph anything else but the lawful leader and ruler of all believers. When for centuries the obvious impotency of the later Abbasid Caliphs seemed to have put the arrogant doctrine of the Caliphate to shame, the Turks in the 16th century were able to restore to this dignity the unity of name and reality. Strong by the might of their weapons, they compelled the majority of the orthodox Muhammadans to recognise them as Caliphs, and they made men forget the conditions 1 That the Khalifate is in no way to be compared with the Papacy, that Islam has never regarded the Khalif as its spiritual head, I have repeatedly explained since 1882 (in ' Nieuwe Bijdragen tot de kennis van den Islam,' in Bijdr. tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederland Indie, Volgr. 4, Deel vi, in an article, ' De Islam,' in De Gids, May, 1886, in Questions Diplomatiques et Coloniales, 5me annee, No. 106, &amp;c.

When in 1258 Baghdad was destroyed by the Mongols and the Ai-assitle Caliphate, dating' more than five centuries back, ^as uipcd out, the ^Jciiianiinf(tan world was not lifted from its hinges, as would have happened il the Caliphate still had had anything to do with ths central government of the Mohammedans. In i'act, this princely house had already been living three centuries and a half on the faint afterglow of its ephemeral splendour; and if during that time it was not crowded out by one of the very powerful sultans, its very practical insignificance was the main reason for that. So insignificant had these Caliphs in name become that certain European writers sometimes have felt induced to represent them as a kind of religious princes of Islam, who voluntarily or not had transferred their secular power to the many territorial princes in the wide dominion of Islam. To them the total lack of secular authority, coupled with the often-manifested reverence of the Moslim for the Caliphate, appeared unintelligible except on the assumption of a spiritual authority, a sort of Mohammedan papacy. Still, such a thing there never was, and Islam, which knows neither priests nor sacraments, could not have had occasion for it. Here, as elsewhere, the multitude preferred legend to fact; they imagined the successor of the Prophet as still watching over the whole of the Moslim community ; as according to historical tradition, he really did during the (irst two centuries following the Hijrah, and this long after the institution of the Caliphate had disappeared in thp political degeneration of Islam. However, they did not imagine him as a Pope, but as a supreme ruler; above all, as the amir-al-miivunin, commander of the legions of Islam, which some time would make the whole world bend to its power. Probably without intention, some European statesmen and writers have oiven a certain support to the Panislamic idea by their consideration, based on an Absolute misunderstanding, of the Caliphate as a kind of Mohammedan papacy. Most of all did tins conception find adherents in England at the time when that country was still considered to be the protector of the Turk against danger threatened bv Uns^ia It was thought useful to make the British-Indian Moslim believe that the l!,lti?h ^ ov ®i Dmen ' was on terms of intimate friendship with the head of their church. .Cuikish statesmen made clever use of this error Of course thpv r»rml 1 + i • before their European friends the real theory of tl o cZhatl with i Ti ^ uniting all the faithful under its banner in o^der to mako^ nl 0 n all I t , 0f rejoiced all the more to see that these had formed about tli-,/in^t . • ' ^ey which, to be sure, was false, but for fc a rye^ n J.iKl ' Slltutl0 ' ? conception They took good care not to correct it, for they were sntisfied iT'w' 8- their co-rehgiomsts, to point to the fact that even amoti' the l,efore powers the claim of the Ottomans to the Caliphate was recJgnfs^dV*—-P rofessor C. H. B ecker: ' Idampolitik ' (Die Welt des I slams 111. 103, 113, BerUn 1915). Translation. —So we see the mediaeval conception of the State slowly accommodate itself to the altered conditions of the times. This is especially the case in the sphere of the particular internal Islam-policy which finds expression in the antithesis— State-control and non-interference in religion. At first sight this problem seems to be actually no problem at all; indeed, if the Caliph were a Pope, this problem would of course not occur ; for then we should have before us a complete hierarchy. But the Caliph is no Pope, rather he is the secular ruler of the ideal community. Beside him stands the Holy Law (sharia or shariat), as the embodiment of the religions factor, which is authoritatively interpreted by the chief mufti of the Hanafi rite, the Shaikh-ul-Islam. As is well known, besides the executive law of the cadis there is in Islam the consultative law of the muftis, which may be compared with the legal opinions given by European jurists, and which has just as little binding force on the judges. Since the 15th century the Shaikh-ul-Islamat has grown to be the highest religious government office in Turkey. The Shaikh-ul-Islam takes equal rank with the Grand Vizier and is his deputy. Though independent as interpreter of the law, he is in his position himself an official who may be dismissed. So in this way, so far as hidividual persons are concerned, the problem of State-control and non-interference in religion i&amp; settled. The most difficult point of colonial Islam-policy is obviously the relation of the European state to the international claims of Islam. This claim confronts us most conspicuously in the custom of extolling the Caliph of the time in a special bidding- prayer during the Friday service. Throughout the- whole history of Islam, the mention of the name of the Caliph at the end of the sermon was an act of special importance. Whoever was mentioned on this occasion, was considered by the community in the particular country to bq. the real sovereign, who could only incidentally be prevented by external circumstances from exercising the actual power of government. So long as the sultans received their investiture from a Caliph (who might indeed happen to be entirely dependent upon them), this usage was quite in order. But it is quite another question, what should be the relation of a Christian authority to this problem. Properly speaking, the Christian domination shuts out the mention of the name of a Caliph; ior, as already stated, the Caliph is indeed no Pope, no spiritual head, but the real sovereign. Nevertheless many European States for various reasons have tolerated and recognised in their territories a bidding-prayer for a foreign ruler. VI.—^1.
