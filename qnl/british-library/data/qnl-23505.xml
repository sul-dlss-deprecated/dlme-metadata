I'l- f(. Political Agent, Bahrain.No. // 3 A. - /(? of 1363 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 17th j/Thanl 1363 June 8, 1944. H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - s Reference your memorandum No. 1683-9/7 dated 7th June 1944. Nakhudas of trading dhows are occasionally given permission by the Bahrain Government to carry one or two rifles and a certain quantity of ammuni tion. As the rifles are registered here and subject to^ inspections I do not think that the practice is likely to enable people to remove firearms from Bahrain in order to sell them abroad. Many of the Nakhudas of the Persian boats carry arms and ammuni tion which they deposit in the customs during their stay in Bahrain. £ ^ Adviser to the Government c* t iO • •</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00004a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1339</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00004a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1339</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 9/7 Arms &amp; Ammunition.
