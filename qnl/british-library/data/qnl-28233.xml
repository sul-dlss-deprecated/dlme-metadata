Political Resident, Persian u-ulf. Indian Political Department, late Political Agent, Bahrain. Mr. Bertram proposed that the draft 1. Air navigation Regulations, 2. Reads of Agreement between Mis Majesty's (rovernment and the Shaikh, ^ ? • Conditions governing the use of the Aer odr omes, Special Authorisatior for aircraft to land in and fly over the territory of the Shaikh, W r e , CirCUlated by the Air Mini stry on the 1st May, should be discussed seriating ~• Air Na vigation Regulations . ^^^waite emphasised that the Air navigation advice ^nd 8 witM U fS be the ^ haikh ' s Regulations 1 issued on the ce and with the consent of His Majesty's Government). I ndia Office contemplated that when the Regulations had been issued over the signature of the Shaikh thly should 1 posted/- 2 ~ posted up [in English and Arabic) at the aerodrome; that a copy should be appended to authorisations to fly over and land in the Shaikh’s territory; that the Air Ministry should publish them in notices to Airmen; and that a copy should be sent to the Passport Office; that and that if and when the Arabian Coast route was opened to private fliers a copy of the regulations should be sent to the I*C.A.n. Mr. Johnstone thought that in view of the somewhat tangled situation as regards the relations between Kis Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh vis-a-vis the I.C.A.N. it v/as desirable to avoid any mention of the Convention in published regulations lthe reference appears in Clause 8} Mr.Laithwaite pointed out, however, that the regulations were the Shaikh’s regulations; he was npt a party to the Convention but he was nevertheless at liberty to apply any part of it in his territory. On the question of Quarantine, Captain Prior said that State regulations at Bahrain were very strict. tfhen there was an outbreak of plague at Basrah, Jrd-class X- )f?S£en S er s on steamers were not allowed to land at Bahrain at all. Colonel Fowle said that he did not see why there should be any difficulty so far as ’’through” passengers on aircraft were concerned, if they were not allowed outside the aerodrome or rest house. He said he would mention the question of quarantine when at Bahrain, and no difficulty need be anticipated in fixing things up satisfactorily. Mr. Laithwaite said that Clause 15 of the Draft Regulations raised the question of the legal position of the political agents. Under an Order in Council, all foreigners at Bahiain were under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and, as all fliers, would be foreigners, it would be for the Political Agent, and not the Shaikh, to deal with contravention!: of the regulations. Under an Order in Council in contempla tion for Kuwait, the position there would be the same. There is not at present an Order in Council applicable to Shargah. The position of Shergah might require further consideration. One method of dealing with the Trucial area would be an Order in Council for the Trucia-1 Coast, but it seemed probable that there might be some difficulty about this. The matter would be taken up separately by the India Office. So far as Muscat territory is concerned the Political Agent has power only over British subjects. Infringements of the regulations in Muscat territory by foreigners would be a matter for the Sultan. Capt. Prior raised the question of Accident regulations and mentioned the £ responsibilities of the political- Agent in the case of shipping. After discussion it was agreed to omit reference to accidents as the regulations were tc be confined to matters concerning the Shaikh. If an accident to a British aircraft occurred in the Shaikh’s territory, the Air Ministry would arrange for it to be investigated if necessary(probably by the Government of India on Air Ministry behalf as in the case of an accident to an Imperial Airways* aircraft at Jask some time ago]. The Draft Regulations were agreed, subject to amendments in the Heading, Glauses 1, 6, lb (iii) and 16, the omission of Cleuees 15 and 14, and the insertion after Clause 11 of a new clause relating to passports. The/The revised regulations are set out in attachment 'A M hereto. 2. Heads of Agreement between His Majesty^ Government and ' the Shaikh . Mr. Bertram stated that the Roya,l Air Force had put forward some proposed amendments affecting Clauses 1 to 7, and also proposed an additional clause ^o.2Cj. Mr. Laithwaite stated that the India Office had no very substantial criticism of the Air Ministry draft on the matters of substance; but the India Office feeling (as expressed on previous occasions and he thought shared by the Foreign Office) was that it was desirable to emphasise the importance of the Shaikh’s position, and so far as possible, while retaining the real control ourselves on all points of importance, to operate behind the facade of the local ruler concerned. He would therefore propose a number of verbal alterations. As regards military aircraft; it was recommended that Clause 3 should be deleted and that the position of military S, i J2^§£ t + ^ d ^ strate a'i c ^ :L requirements should be dealt with outside the agreement by letters to ue exchanged between the local ruler and His Majesty’s Government prior to, or concurrently with, the signature of the agreements. It was left to the Air Ministry to draft a suitable letter and forward the draft to the India Office and the Foreign Office. It was also suggested that all reference to ’’allies of His Britannic Majesty* and to ’’war” should be avoided. Wing Commander McClaughry wished it to be understood that he did not commit the Service side to accepting the deletion of Clause 3 (as worded in the Royal Air Force amendment referred to above]. The Service amendment to Clause 4 was not adopted, the Political Departments taking the view that the amended form set out in the schedule to these minutes was as far as it was necessary or desirable to go. Wing Commander McClaughry said that his instructions on iy this clatise were very definite and he would have to refer back to D.C.A.S. #ith regaxd to Clause 7 Wing Commander McClaughry said the Service side would prefer it should be worded to the effect that conditions should be drawn up by His Majesty's Govennment in collaboration with the Shaikh, but this was not agreed to by the Political Departments. He also suggested that mention should be made of a rest house and other facilities (Clause 8). The India Office view was that the position was adequately covered by Clause 1. It was agreed as regards Clause 18 to retain alternative (a) and delete alternative (b). a So ^-r as the Royal Air Force were concerned, the present ?th ?™V?&lt; re £ peCt ° f Bahrain wil1 continue in operation (.he Royal Air Force pay duty on petrol and oil at Bahrain;. The agreement will not epply to an agreement covering a period! of 11 Shargah at present, since years has already been c oncluded/-4- concluded with the Shaikh for the use of Shargah. As to the additional clause (20} suggested by the Service side, Colonel Fowle pointed out that ail foreigners had the right to protection and there is no doubt that the Shaikh is responsible for providing such protection. It was considered that the position would be strengthened by omitting this clause. Wing Commander McClaughry, hov/ever, thought that each case should be treated on its merits - at Bahrain the question did not arise; at Kuwait it might arise; ahd at Shargah it definitely did arise. ( Note ; in any case the agreement under discussion v/ill not apply to Shargah at present). Subject to Wing Commander Mc^laughry*s reservations, the Heads of agreement in accordance with attachment M B W hereto werex agreed. Conditions governing the Use of Aerodromes. These conditions were agreed in the terms of attach ment H C M hereto, amendments having been made in the heading Clause 1 of the Air Ministry Draft, and clauses 5, 6, 7, and 10 of that draft omitted. (Clause 10 to be covered if necessary under the exchange of letters referred to at 2. above. 4• Special authorisation for Ai rcraft to land in and fly over the Territory of the Shaikh. Wing Commander McClaughry pressed for the inclusion of a condition prescribing the route to be followed. Mr. Dibdin doubted whether any one Shaikh could influence the route. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that the power of a Shaikh to prescribe the route ended with the boundary of his territorial waters. On the other hand, it would be open to His Majesty’s Government ( and they had in fact adopted this course in the communications to the French and Dutch Governments) to indicate that having regard to the special conditions in this area and the special responsibilities falling upon His Majesty’s Government we must require them as a condition of the grant of facilities along the Arab Air Route to fly a prescribed route. So far as Imperial Airways and other British units were concerned the necessary pressure in the same sense would presumably be brought to bear without difficulty by the Air Ministry. Mr. Bertram agreed with Mr. laithwaite. The ’’authorisation' was adopted in the form of attachment ”b” hereto.8 ./ (?) i TERRITORY OF AIR NAVIGATION REGULATIOIIS FOR CIVIL A IRCRAFT mm by ire.

Received ^rd July.) \ % jo arrived from Fowle. \ 1J v ^ 2. We see na Objection to the addition in Document B of a new clause 15(a) in the terms suggested by Fowle. 3. The proposed addition to clause 2 of Document B is rather more difficult. 'Hiere is clearly much force in the arguments put forward by the Resident and Dickson. On the other hand we have, as you will remember, throughout been very anxious on general grounds to operate so far as possible behind the facade of the Shaildis and to avoid any possibility of friction between Airways as the agents of His Majesty T s Government and foreign air companies, etc. Moreover, we were anxious to reduce contacts between Airways and the local rulers to a minimum, and to keep arrangements so far as possible in the/ F.G.L.Bertram, Esq.,C.B.E,, Air Ministry, Gwydyr House, Whitehall,3.W.l.the hands of the local political authorities on the one hand, and the Shaikh on the other* ?or these reasons we should, 1 think, have preferred on the whole to have left the draft as it stands on this point and see hov; things went in practice, our assumption being that our position in the various States would in ordinary circumstances be such as t o enable us to deal effectively with obstruction on the part of minor State officials. If responsibility for the supervision of the aerodromes (save as^regards customs, quarantine, police and passports) is vested in Imperial Airways as the agents appoint ed for this purpose by His Majesty’s Government under the terms ;of an agreement with the Shaikh, the risks of friction with foreign companies the responsibility for which v/ill fall upon His Majesty’s Government, seem likely to be greater. On the other hand certain of the supervisory functions under Document A (checking of licences, logbooks, etc,, compliance with requirements of certificate of airworthiness, compliance with rules as to lights and signals and rules for air traffic) can clearly most satisfactorily be discharged only by a relatively expert agency, 4, On the whole, then, in the light of the above c onsiderati ons and of the views of the 'Resident and Dickson, we should be prepared, subject to any views expressed by Foreign Office or Air Ministry, to accept Fowle’s proposal, subject possibly to the insertion in the draft addition pro posed by him after the word 'supervision” of the words ” in respect of such aerodrome or aerodromes,” ( on the understand ing, of course, that, as suggested by him, passport, customs and medical arrangements should remain wholly in the hands of the Shaikh’s passport and. customs officials and of the Quarantine Medical Officer respectively and that police-3- responsibility won Id equally vest wholly with the State). 5. As regards Fov/le’s note on clause 10, we have, I think, always recognised that there must he slight variations in the form of these agreements to meet local circumstances. But by way of maintaining the principle, if not the practice, of quarantine control, it would, I think, be better to retain the Quarantine Clause in the Agreement with Muscat in respect of Owadur, even if in present conditions clause 10 is a dead letter so far as Gwadur is concerned. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner and to B^eirse. We should be most grateful if you could let us have your views as early as possible, (I fear pressure of other work here has already involved some delay in dealing with Towle’s points), since it is now becoming quite urgent to dispose of these questions of procedure, which are to some extent holding up action on the Butch request for facilities on the Arab route. Could you in this connection let me have the particulars to be printed as the first Schedule to Document C ? We should also be glad to have ( at any rate in the case of Bahrain and possibly Gwadur, which are alone of immediate importance ) the particulars for insertion in the Second Schedule to the same document, so that comprehensive instructions can be sent to the Resident* (Sgd.)

As Yv’ill be seen from the correspondence in question, there is now general agreement, in the light of discussions with Lieutenant Colonel Foyle, among the interested Departments of His Majesty 1 s Government as to the advantage of adoptiiig a uniform procedure in dealing with the provision of air facilities in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. Agreement has also been reached as to the general basis of such a procedure. The broad features of the procedure proposed are that the Arab rulers concerned should be advised to make air navigation regulations of their own in terms drafted by His Majesty's Government; to issue a special authorisation in respect of/ &gt;reign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla*of aircraft permitted to fly over and land in their territories; to lay down in terns to he approved hy Government conditions to govern the use of their aerodromes; and finally to enter into agreements with His Majesty 1 s Government under which His Majesty 1 s Government shall have exclusive rights, subject to certain conditions, to establish and maintain, as the agents of the Sheikh concerned, and subject to the terms of the air navigation regulations, etc. referred to above, an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services within the ruler T s territory, and to charge and retain fees in respect of the use of such aerodromes and such ancillary services. As will be seen, the broad principle underlying the proposed new procedure is that, while full control should in fact rest in the hands of His Majesty T s Government, it should, so far as possible, appear to rest with the local ruler. J. I am now to enclose copies of (1) Air navigation regulations for civil aircraft- to be made by the local ruler concerned. (2) Draft heads of agreement between His Majesty T s Government and the Sheikh (3ul'trm) of the principality concerned; ( 3 ) Conditions to be laid down with the approval of the Ruler to govern the use of the 1 aerodrome(s^ ( 4 ) Draft special authorisation, for issue by the Ruler, for aircraft to fly over and land in the territory §f the local ruler concerned. The second schedule to the Third Document referred to above is still under consideration by Imperial Airways. Every effort will be made to obtain with the minimum of delay the information required, but it is thought undesirable any longer to postpone a communication on the general question for this reason.4 * I am to request that, if no objection is seen, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may now be instructed to secure the consent of the Sheikii of Bahrein, the Sheikh of Koweit and (in respect of Gwadur) the Sultan of Muscat to the adoption of a procedure of the nature suggested and to the completion of agreements in the terms of the drafts which have been agreed. Shargah is already covered by a separate agreement which will not expire until 1942. Minor facilities such as emergency landing grounds in States other than those referied to above can best be dealt with separately on terms to be approved in the light of the special circumstances of each case. 9 .

Sir, Draft Air Agreement with Shaikh of Kuwait. Reference your memorandum No # C/21, dated the 9th January 1934 and the previous connected correspondence. 2* I have the honour to report that/instructed by you, I duly gave the Shaikh the draft copies in Arabic of each of the foblowing (a) Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft!A) (b) Heads of Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh (B). (o) Conditions laid down with approval of Shaikh to govern use of aerodrome (C) with schedule. (d) Special Authorization for Aircraft to land in or fly over Kuwait (D). 3. Knowing the value of ’’going slow' with the Arab^ and the advantage to be gained by waiting for the 'right moment', I purposely delayed giving the papers to His Excellency till two days after the 'ID' (39.1.34)* 4* Then I did present them I merely gave His Excellency a brief summary of the contents, and aiggested that he study them for a week, after which I would come round and ask if he had any suggestions to make. 5, From the Shaikh’s obviously 'defensive' attitude when you introduced the matter to him on the 9th January in my Drawing Room, I decided that if I attempted to 'rush things' there would be trouble, so I purposely went about- 2 r'^ about the rnatt©r deliberately and apparently casually, as mentioned above. 6. To-day (25.1.54), I visited the Shaikh to get his answer and fcund him reasonable beyond my expectations. He had only two points to raise: (a) The question oT our taking all landing fees etc., and he getting £500/- per annum (See Draft Clauses 9 and 10.) (b) The question of exemption from Customs of oil, petrol, etc. for aircraft generally. (See Draft B, Clause 15). Ls regaids (a) he thou^it it would look nicer in the eyes of his people if he waived the £500/- and was given each month the actual landing and other fees which would be collected by us. I had little difficulty in getting him to drop this suggestion. as regards (b) , the obaikh adopted an entirely fiira attitude, and asked that Clause 15 of Draft Agreement B should be altered to read something as follows: 'The Shaikh agrees to exempt from customs or 'other duties, petrol and oil imported by 'His Majesty’s (rovemment or their appointed 'Agents for the purpose of refuelling His 'Majesty’s Royal Air Force aircraft, also 'aircraft and spare parts therefor, aero 'engines and parts therefor, wireless and ’D/F apparatus for the wireless and direction 'finding station and spare parts therefor, 'the property of His Majesty’s Royal Air Force; 'this exemption not to include petrol and oil 'or any of the spare parts enumerated above 'required for the aircraft of British or other 'c ommerci&amp;l cone erns f .importance and would really not bear at all hardly on commercial concerns, seeing that the total customs duty liable to be charged would never exceed 4 % ad valorem on any article. Ihe question was one of principle and pride with him, ho said, and ho ashed His Majesty f s Government to meet him in this one matter in return for his so readily agreeing to everything else. 8, faking every thing together, I strongly recommend that His Majesty 1 s Government adopt a concilia to jy attitude in this matter and that they agree to the Shaikh’s request without cavil. He shall win the Shaikh’s good will from the first if we do, and conversely if we press him and insist on customs exemption for civil aircraft, he, no doubt, will surrender in the long run, but v/e shall definitely lose his confidence, already sadly impaired in other directions.

He was most nice about the whole thing and told me to tell you that n© was grateful to you for having mentioned the new situation which had arisen in Bahrain, and he thou^it it particularly straightforward of you to give him a diance of backing out of his acceptance of the £.500 (and no customs dues on petrol) arrangement, if he so wished. 4. Ie said however that he would prefer to leave matters as they stood, and not alter his decision if thi. mad© no difference to you, as he believed the line he had taken was the one that would give more satisfaction to Bis Majesty’s Govern ment. 5. Should however it suit your plans better to hsve a uniform agreement fa- both Bahrain and Kuwait, he added that he wou3.d be quite willing to fall into line. This you could decide later. 6.

This will not, however, affect the existing agreement under which a rental of £110 per annum is payable to ’ our Excellency’s Government in respect of llanamah aerodrome f . (This sentence in the case of Bahrein only). The reasons for the suggested amendments to the Political resident’s draft as amended by the Government of India, and further by you, are as follow:- fi) The phrase ai lit ary aircraft'' is thought to require amplification to extend it to ^minion and Colonial aircraft. This is in accordance with para,2fa) of Air Ministry letter to you 31992/8.6. of i5th lay, 1933. (ii) The words 'when H.&amp;.O. consider that circumstances regwire it” have been inserted after the words 'enjoy priority because although priority is essential for military aircraft in certain circumstances, it can hardly be reasonably demanded on all occasions. Laithwaite, Lsq., ndi© Office, ■ j'.i. (iii)/(iii) |he word 'of' has been substituted for 'have in the third line from the bottom of your letter, and in line 6 of the Political resident’s draft in order to ensure priority for military aircraft m the use of facilities as well as in the use ot the aerodromes t on occasionr when this is considered to be necessary. This is in accordance ^ith the wording ot para.? (a) of our official letter to you .J1992/B.5. of the 15th ay, 1933. (if) The words 'hand that use of such aerodromes shall he accorded free of charge ?J have been substituted for ?? and free of charge’* in view of the fact that it is reasonable^ expect that military aircraft should pay for facilities which have been provided by and solely at the expense of Imperial Airways, though we realise that the Sheikhs are not concerned with our relations with Imperial Airways• I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office.

The said Military aeroplanes have, in the past, been using the aerodrome, without ever being asked for anything in the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty - all this in order to assist His Majesty’s Government. We now confirm that they, the Military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrain Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £.120/- apart from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore, that His Majesty’s Government will very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual Ending.No. 195^4, Dated the 26th May 1934.

You will notice that the Shaikh in his letter (c) above, while 'confirming that all military aircraft belong ing to, or in the service of His Majesty’s Cxovemment, should enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome etc.', has put forward a request that he should, if possible, receive equal treatment with Bahrain in the matter of tbs £.120/- per annum, which the latter State receives frcm the Royal Air Force, 5. As the Shaikh, I know, feels deeply that preferential treatment has in some way or other been won by Shaikh Haxaad for the Bahrain Covemment, at the expense of himself, who (to use his own words) before Bahrain was ever visited by any R.A.F.aireraft, always did every thing he possibly could to assist Military machines landing at or making use of the aerodrome at Kuwait, I should be grateful if the matter could, in some way, be put before the Air Ministry in London for their consideration. 6* I personally am unaware as to how Bahrain in the first place came to be given £, 120/- per annum, and Kuwait nothing, but no doubt there were good reascais# In any ease I trust I shall be given instructions in due course, as to the reply I s® to give the bhaikh as he/- 3 - he is most anxious to hear the result of his request in this respect.

Sir I have the honour to enclose copy of letter Bo. C-199, dated the 29th Kay 1934, from the Political %ent, Kuwait, with enclosures, from which it will be seen that the Sheikh has signed the Civil /ir Agreement. This reflects credit on Colonel Dickson*s persuasive powers as the Shaikh at first evinced a certain amount of suspicion towards the agree ment, chiefly 1 think on account of its unavoidably voluminous nature. ^ith regard to parr graphs 4-6 of Colonel Dickson* s letter. The reason why Bahrain in the first place (paragraph 6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter) came to be given £ 120/- per annum, and Kuwait nothing, is 1 imagine quite simple. The Shaikh of Bahrain asked for £ 120/- per annum and the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for nothing. The reason, too, why the Shaikh of Kuwait gave the use of his landing ground rent-free, and the Shaikh of Bahrain asked for rent, is I think not far to seek. Kuwait being part of the mainland in case of emergency is largely dependent on the Royal Air Force for protection, and Bahrain being an island is noti as long as His Majesty* s Sloops are in the Persian Gulf no force can invade Bahrain from the mainland./«■*«» ^ - * ^hhp mmmamm 145, &gt; mainland* in ot/.er words the coming of the Hoyel Air Force to Kuwait was more in the interests of the latter than of the former, while in Bahrain it was the Royal A*r j?o*ee chiciiy benefited since Bahrain is an essential link in the strategical route to India, and no corresponding advantage of defence accrued to the State. \ ■ ■ s * Moreover Bahrain and Kuwait in the mat er of landing grounds are not on all fours. At the former there are two leixiing grounds) (*) On Manaoah Island, for use of which the Royal Air Force pay the £ l£0/-rent referred to by the dhalfch of Kuwait, and which Is now practically a military aerodrome. Further the £ 120/- not only covers the use of the aerodrome but also the &amp;ite for t&amp;e r.oyal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Best house, etc. which is situated on Menamah. (b) On ^uharraq Island which is the civil aerodrome, the use of which by the Royal Air Force is given free under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement. At Kuwait there is only one aerodrome, corresponding to that on ^uh&amp;rr&amp;q, and no base. *• I mm not of opinion therefore that the Shaikh has any claim to the £ 120/- in connection with the Civil Air Agreement, and I suggest that I be authorised to send him the attached letter. I hrve not mentioned in my draft the arguments contained in paragraph 2 above but the Political Agent, Kuwait, when presenting the letter might at his discretion elaborate these en titre personel . The Shaikh is not backward in stressing His ^ajesty 1 s Government’s obliga tions to him and it does no harm, I think, from time to time to/«»3«» to point out to him the corresponding benefits which he receives, Fro » ifcat paragraph of the Shaikh’s letter *1 is quite possitrle tiu*t wnile relinquishing the request i or the £ 1 £G/» rental he uiay state that he wishes to charge duty on Royal / ir Force fuel as is done by the Bahrain atate, Xf he does so this point can be taken up on its merits* In connection* however, with a possible future Royal Mr Force base at Kuwait,(vice correspondence ending with Secretary of State for India’s telegram Ko.1193, dated the ©th S5ay 1934), for the option on the site of which £ 100/- yearly rental to the i haikh nas been suggested, I think that this might be raised to £ 120/- which, as far as bases are concerned, woula then place Kuwait on a level with Bahrain, and satisfy the Shaikh. 1 am fcending a copy of this letter and of its enclosures texcept sub-encloeure (t.) of which only one spare copy it available) to the Government of India, 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, ad.

It is possible that Your Excellency has not apprecia ted the difference between conditions at Bahrain and Kuwait* At Bahrain there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island, for which/mm- which the Koyiiil Air Force pay the £ 120/. referred to # and which is a ailit&amp;ry aerodrejsae, eetatliahed before the civil route woe opened, and the other on iluharraq, which in used by i#ivil t ud rioyf 1 Air Force aircraft^ for which the aame agreement hao been signed by His hjcoeliency *&gt;haiich Hemad as has been signed by you. 4 * Moreover the £ 120/- already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, nest house, etc* which is situated on Man&amp;mah# At Kuwait there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base.

After compliments, With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter No. C. 193, dated the 9th inst. (23.5.34), and understood what it contained with regard to the military aeroplanes belonging to or used in the service of His Majesty’s Government. We always have pleasure in assisting in any matters that appertain to His Majesty’s Government. The said military aeroplanes have, in tire past, been using the aerodrome without ever being asked for anything in the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty- all this in order to assist His Majesty’s Government. We now confirm that they, the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 apart from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore that His Majesty’s Government will very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual ending. Draft Letter to His Excellency Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Euler of Koweit. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s letter No. R 4/1518 of 12th Safar 1353 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Koweit, and note that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything. I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to thank Your Excellency for this. 2. In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3. His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not_ appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit. At Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island, for which the Royal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharraq, which is used by civil and Royal Air lorce aircraft, for which the same Agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you. 4. Moreover the £120 already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, &amp;c., which is situated on Manamah. 5. At Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty’s Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the Above facts, will doubtless see that conditions in the two States are materially different. 2, Airci (ii) The rmsor co lit! licence (iv)Tb 1 The Ipii the at ■ The pu Iferved. a The tniiygi f).

After compliments. With reference to the Agreement signed by Your Excellency on the subject of the use of your aerodrome by civil aircraft, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that IIis Majesty’s Government expect that military aircraft belonging to or employed in the service of His Majesty’s Government shall at all times as hitherto enjoy priority (when His Majesty’s Government considers that circumstances require it) in the use of any aerodrome which may be established or maintained for civil aircraft, and of full facilities, without specific prior permission, and that use of such aerodrome shall be accorded free of charge. Usual end in pr o* Translation of a Confidential Letter No. R. 4/1518, dated the \2th Safar 1353, equivalent to 2%ih May 1934, from His Excellency the Ruler of Koweit to the Political Agent, Koweit. After compliments, _ With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter No. C. 193, dated the 9th inst. (23.5.34), and understood what it contained with regard to the military aeroplanes belonging to or used in the service of His'Majesty’s Government. We always have pleasure in assisting in any matters that appertain to His Majesty’s Government. The said military aeroplanes have, in the past, been using the aerodrome without ever being asked for anything in ’the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty- all this in order to assist His Majesty’s Government. We now confirm that they, the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 apart from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore that His Majesty’s Government wiU very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual ending. Draft Letter to II%$ Excellency Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Koweit. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s letter NojR 4/1518 of 12th Safar 1353 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Koweit, and nete that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy, priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything. I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to thank Your Excellency'for this. 2. In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3. His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit. At Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island, for which the Royal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharraq, which is used by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same Agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you. 4. Moreover the £120 already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, &amp;c., which is situated on Manamah. 5. At Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty’s Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the above facts, will doubtless see that conditions in the two States are materially different. * These letters are confidential and are not for publication. The Draft Letter to the Sheikh is still under consideration.m P.Z. 4125/34.

Sir, / P vyith reference to India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.4125/1934, dated the 13th July 1934, forwarding printed copies of the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement, I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that Imperial Airways Co, Ltd., have so far friled to pay His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait any monies due to him prior to the signature by the latter of the Air Agreement on 23rd May 1934. 2. From paragraph 1 of H,M f s Secretary of State for India’s telegram No.989, dated the 19th April 1934, forwarded under your Printed Letter No.360-S, dated the 20th April 1934, it will be seen that £.500/- should have been paid to His Excellency the Shaikh from the Company for the period 7th January 1933 to 7th January 19 34. Also there is the sum of £.188-18-0 due to the Shaikh for the broken period 7th January 1934 to 23ro Kay 1934 (date of formal signature of Air Agreement) • This makes a total sum of £.688-18-0 due to the Shaikh, apart from the £.500 owing for the period embraced in the year 23rd May 1934 to 23rd May 1935. 3. I should be greatly obliged if the Company could be requested to pay the above sums to the shaikh by cheque at as early a date as possible, as the Shaikh is feeling worried about the non-receipt of the money, and has already approached 1 ■3 / ^ approached me verbally on the matter* 4. As regards fatur© payments of the Shaikh’s annual subsidy, nothing is laid down in the Air Agreement as to whether this sum should be paid at the beginning or at the end of each year, and I should be grateful if a ruling on this point could be obtained for the information of the Shaikh.

It will be observed that the Political Resident estimates the amount in question at £688:18;0, of which £188:18:0 is in respect of the period 7th Janary 1934 to 23rd May 1934. The Secretary of State is not clear on what basis this latter figure has been reached. On a yearly basis it would appear to be too high and on a monthly basis too low: but the difference involved is in any event very small. The Air Council will no doubt consider whether 23rd May 1934 might not more appropriately be regarded as the first day of the period covered by the formal agreement which has now been concluded. 2./ icretary, • Ministry, Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W.l.&gt; 2 . 2. Attention is also invited to paragraph 4 of the enclosure to Colonel Fowls’s despatch of 23rd November in regard to the question of future payments of the Sheikh’s annual subsidy under the Civil Air Agreement. Subject to the concurrence of the Air Council Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that payment might also now be made to the Sheikh of K owe it in respect of the year from 23rd May 1934 to 23rd May 1935 and that further annual instalments of the Sheikh's subsidy, and similar payments under the Bahrein and Muscat Civil Air Agreements, might in future be made annually in advance on the date of signature of these Agreements.

My dear Fowle, I venture to bother you on one or two points which have arisen on the 'special authorisations' recently issued in favour of Irnperial Airways, etc. by the sheikh of Bahrein, copies of whicn you sent us under cover of your printed despatch No. 1170-3 of 10th December. In the first place the word 'British' appears to have been omitted before the word 'nationality' in paragraph 1 in all three cases. This is no aoubt merely a clerical error. 3. Secondly, paragraph a does not lay down a time limit for the validity of 'special authorisations'. It was originally intended that there should be such a time limit f £5 I.Q. T think' nlpar* fVnm -hho n-f + &gt;1 ^ m*2 © %0 ^ should be. After informal consultation with the Air Ministry we now suggest that the period in question should be one year. This will of course mean that companies operating air services will have to apply annually through the usual channels for a renewal of their {| special autnorisations”. Paragraph 2 should therefore read 'This authorisation is limited to the period from/Insert ciate of issue of authorisation toJ inclusive and is granted...' 4. while the points referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are of relatively minor importance, we think, in the light of discussion with the Air Ministry, fvthat it would be desirable to obtain amended /’authorisations' from the sheikh of Bahrein and to ensure that any 'authorisations' issued by the sheikh )f Ko-weit and the sultan of Muscat are in similar form, [f you see no objection we should be grateful if the necessary steps might be taken. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry will postpone any communication to Imperial Airways. 5. The Air Ministry have also raised a point in regard to paragraph 2(iii) of the 'authorisation', which/3 which lays down that the 'authorisation” or &amp; certified true copy oi it shall he carried hy the aircraft. I am not sure that it has ever been made clear that it was desired that tne orInina1 'authorisations' issued under this paragraph in Bahrein (anci similarly in the case of Muscat and Koweit), should he sent to the India Office for transmission via the Air Ministry to Imperial Airways and in the present instance copies only have been received. The Air Ministry feel difficulty in certifying 'true copies' in the absence of the originals and we should therefore be grateful, if no objection is seen, if we might have originals of the authorisations now under discussion (with the amendments referred to in paragraph 3 above); and if in future originals might be sent home of any 'authorisations' issued in respect of the Gulf states. 6.
