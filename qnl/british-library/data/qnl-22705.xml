I should be glad to receive any observations you may be in a position to offer pending examination of proposal by interested Departments of His Majesty's Government with reference to strategic considerations involved, 'position of Cable and Wireless, etc. Facilities desired by Company are of course in excess of those granted to Bahrein Petroleum Company for radio telephone installation in 193^-&gt; cf. my telegram of the i8th ^ipril, 193^5 No. 970, and connected correspondence. The issue of the above has been authorised. - , (Sgd.) R. PEtl- L./VlV P. Z.7433/1938. 11, Birchin Lane, London, E.G.3* 3rd November, 1938.. Dear Mr. Gibson, A short while ago I mentioned to you the desire of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to instal and to operate in Bahrein, Jireless Transmission Apparatus which will permit of voice and key transmission between the Company's Station in Bahrein and the Mainland of Saudi-Arabia. These means of communication are found to be necessary to the businesses of both Companies: they would be available and, without doubt, used at all times throughout the day and night. As you know, the California Arabian Standard Oil uompany is a Corporation of United States American origin, operating on the Arabian Mainland under a Petroleum Concession held from King Ibn Sa'oud. The Company is now in the course of erecting a Wireless Station at Dammam for use in the general purposes of its business. In addition, various working parties, scattered as they are over a wide area without any other means of communicatioi with each other or with Headquarters or with Bahrein, are being equipped with portable Wireless Transmission and Receiving oets so that their progress may be facilitated and their well-being assured in the event of trouble arising in any way, including accidents of a serious nature. The view of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company is that a radio installation at Bahrein with a radiophone frequency over 30 megacycles and of low power, and being highly directional between Stations, would be sufficient for all practical purposes and be unlikely to interfere with any other tireless Operations in the Gulf, and if there were no objection from His Majesty's Government to it, that is the Installation the Company would instal in Bahrein. Both/2. Both the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited 'believe that it would 'be of advantage to them if the 'Jireless Apparatus in Bahrein could, in case of need, he connected to the Telephone System by which The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited receives and transmits ordinary land line communications at and from its Camp at Awali. The use of the Apparatus would not be in any way competitive with Cable &amp; Wireless Limited. . .Jvery effort would be made by both Companies at all times to avoid interference with the operations in the Gulf of His Majesty's Air Force and Navy. No approach has yet been made by the Company to the Government of Bahrein and unless you think it advisable to do so, the Company does not intend to make any such approach until the views of His Majesty's Government are made known to the Company. Might I ask you now to accept this letter as a formal request addressed to His Majesty's Government by California Arabian Standard Oil Company with the concurrence of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited for permission to erect and use on Bahrein Island, the Apparatus referred to above ? If you require any further information from either the California ^rablan Standard Oil Company or The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited and you will let me know, we shall oe pleased to endeavour to supply it.

I now enclose a cony of ] le ttei' ex the 3rd. Jovenbcr in which t e Gooipany's proposal is set out. we should be glad to have the advice of the Imperial Communications Committee upon it as in the case of the proposal of the Bahrein Petroleum Comp. to set up a radio-telephone installation in 1934. ^see, e.g., paper No. I .C .C.153S^ dated 8th January, 1934, and VLr- it A the minutes of the 88th 'Meeting held on April 13th, 1934). I understand you will take the necessary steps to consult the Departments concerned, including, I presume, the Foreign Office. Meanwhile we are asking the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for any comments he can offer at this stage. Service Departments would see any objection to the proposal if the Company were required to maintain and operate the installation in such a manner as not to interfere with such wireless stations as may be maintained by Imperial Airways or by His Majesty's wireless sets who are working away from , ^ V f \k. t K The points for consideration are whet er the M.,.Ryan, sq., D.3.O., M .C., Jora^ it tee of imperial Defence Cable/2. Government , and whether the rights and privileges of Cghlo and wireless Limited would he sufficiently respected if the Company, as a condition of receiving the desired pe rtni ss i o n,we re obliged to operate the apparatus in such a way as to ca se no technical interference with the Gable and Wireless Station in Bahrein, to exchange messages only with the Company 1 s representatives on the; mainland or travelling between the mainland and Bahrein, and to confine such messages to the legitimate business of the Company. As regards the latter point Mr. Ballantyne exxilains to me that, while the proposed wireless installation might in fact be competitive with the operations of Cable and tireless in so far as it would interfere with any prospect of their making profits in the future from handling the Oil Company's communications between Bahrein and the mainland, it would not subtract from the traffic at 'present handled by Cable and tireless which have no means of communicating direct with the mainland opposite Bahrein. (At present the Cable and Wireless station at Bahrein can communicate with the Saudi Government station at Qatif via Jedda or Basra, but Qatif is some distance away from Demmara and the Company find it more convenient to communicate with the mainland by launch). Apart from that, he represented that the Cable and .Vireless station was not open for the despa ch of messares throughout the twenty-four hours, itsuse would always entail more or less delay in the transmission and receipt of messages, and it would not meet such requirements as the keeping in touch by wireless with the Company's launches passing between the mainland and Bahrain. As re ards the transmission of messo es xrom the/1 mainland to Bahrein it may 'be necessary to consider the rights of Cable and uireleas uncer the Agreement of % l?th April, 1935, 'between 3audi Arabia, the Sudan, anc \ the Eastern Telegraph Company and Gable and wireless /| (Foreign Office print ated ISth May, 1935, No. S29 5/66/25) Mr. Ballantyne is aware that in view of this Agreement the California Arabian Jtandard Oil Company could not use the wireless station they propose to erect on the mainland for direct communication with the Standard Oil headquarters in San Francisco. Will you let me know if you wish us to obtain the views of Cable and Wireless on the Oil Company*s proposal? It will no doubt be necessary to consult them at some stage. I have nromised Mr. Ballantyne that the matter will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.

It is rumoured that the reason s e. for /'2 - for this was that he feared that any other arrangement would probably result in a demand from the Italian Legation in Jedda for their own wireless installation for direct communication with Rome. On the other hand Cable and Wireless are apparently unwilling to come to any arrangement which does not provide for their possession and control of the installation in Bahrain.

THORNBURG VICE PRESIDENT CONFIDENTIAL Awali, Bahrein Island, 25tli June, 1940. H. Weightman, Esq. , H.B.M's Political Agent, The Agency, Bahrein. Dear Sir, The efforts we are making to insure uninterrupted operation at full capacity of our oil production, refining and shipping at Bahrein makes it urgently necessary that our operations here be closely co-ordinated with those a few miles away in Saudi Arabia. Kot only are we faced with the possibility of losing considerable numbers of our British employees for active service, but the uncertainty of shipping makes the replacement of both men and of essential materials and supplies uncertain. It is only by the closest possible co-ordination of operations between The Bahrein Petroleum Company and The California Arabian Standard Oil Company (of identical owner ship) that the full benefit of their combined resources can be assured. To this end the parent companies at home have issued general instructions that uninterrupted full capacity operation at Bahrein is to be given priority over all other parent company interests in this area. While the shortest distance between Bahrein and the mainland is only about 15 miles our launch route from A1 Khobar to Manama is S8 miles, through a treacherous area reefs and shoals, and made more hazardous by sudden and severe winds and cross currents. The passage is never made at night except by shalbw draft native launches. As you know we are sparing no effort to find and mark better channels, but communication by boat will for a long time limit us to practically independent operation of these two neighbouring companies. You know too that more than one third of our crude supply for Bahrein Refinery is brought over from Arabia by barge when conditions permit and by tanker from Has Tanura v /hen necessary. Most of this supply must be continued if our refinery here is to maintain full output.- 2 - In view of these circumstances we request permission from the Bahrein Government to install and oBerate a small wireless set, in our office here, capable of direct and continuous communication with company headquarters in Dhahran. We wish to use this means of communication solely for internal company business, in the same way that we use our own telephone system between our offices and refinery or shipping wharf here. As for the possibility of interfering with Imperial Airways' communications, no real ground for objection can exist. We have had many wireless sets operating in this immediate area for a long while, both in Arabia and within our own Bahrein concession, with ^ absolutely no history of interference. We are not asking for permission to install a more powerful station, but merely for permission to use the ones we now have xor talking across our concession boundary. We recognize that in present circumstances ■nrovision must be made for censorship over such communications and are ready to meet any reasonable demands to that end; cnich as providing a listening station in any Bahrein ^ Government or H.M.G. Office, or paying for a censor assigned to full time supervision of conversations at our station. For your information, the Saudi Arabian Government has consated to operation of such communications between oul offiSs, with the proviso that the company station in Arabia shall work only with our private company station in Bahrein and not with a commercial or any other station here. Thev recognize the importance of having an inter-company ooSuSoaSon system for the conduct of I 00 * 1 but will not permit this to be extended - for example oy involving Cable and Wireless in what they consider, as we do, purely a local operating service. We have on hand all equipment necessary to put this communication system into effect, an fJ^^weceive urgent need for it we hope that this request will receive prompt attention.

MEMORANDUM Wireless Installation by California Arabian Standard Oil Company for communication between Bahrein and the mainland. In response to my letter of the 19th to Mr. Edward Wilshaw, Chairman and Managing Director of Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., suggesting a meeting to-day, a Major J.J.Munro telephoned me yesterday and I arranged an appointment at ten o'clock this morning with him for Mr. Ballantyne and myself. At our meeting this morning Major Munro called in Mr K.L.Wood, who is the Engineer in Chief. Apparently these gentlemen had not seen a copy of Mr. Ballantyne's letter to the India Office asking for permission to make a wireless installation in Bahrein. They started out by asking us how long we would require the service each day, and when we explained that we needed a service both key and voice, for twentyfour hours a day, giving various reasons for such requirements and pointing out that the suggested wavelength would be over 30 megacycles, they appeared to regard the proposal in quite a different light than at the beginning of the interview. I pointed out that the Arabian Company was in the course of installing a transmitting and receiving set on the mainland to keep in touch with ships and boats, and which installation would presumably be used for the necessary communications with Bahrein. I also pointed out the advisability of arrangements in Bahrein so that the voice transmission could be coupled with the Bahrein telephone system to reach the camp of the Bahrein Company at Manama. The matter was left with Major Munro and Mr. Wood for further study, after which they will get in touch with Mr. Lebkicher or Mr. Ballantyne. L. N.

Mr. M. E. Lombardi San Francisco. odu a! Extract from the above letter 'In the conversation which Mr. Ballantyne and the writer had with Major Monro sometime ago, he was most emphatic in saying that under no circumstances could they permit the Company to instal their own radio set in the Company's office in Manama, explaining that because of their contracts with the air-lines they must have all transmitting sets in Bahrein absolutely under their control. Unless they can be induced to modify this attitude which does not seem hopeful, the Company will probably have to agree to the set being installed by and in the office of Cable and wireless but the enclosed proposal seems to us to be the next best thing for giving the Company control over a direct inter-coomunication. w L. N. HAMILTON.6, Lothbury, London, E.G.2. May 16th, 1940. F-SE. Mr. M. E. Lombard!, San Francisco. By appointment I called at the office of Cable and wireless this morning to see Major Munro, their Traffic Manager, about the matter of radio telephone communication between Dhahran and Bahrein. I made this appointment after receiving your letter F-402 of May 1st. Mr. Sabater, whom Major Munro called in, was also present during the meeting. I explained the necessity and urgency of establishing radio communication between Dhahran and Bahrein from the point of view of oil shipments, the general volume of Company business between the mainland and Bahrein, and emergency help. I emphasised the point that the communication in question should be regarded as a private telephone line rather than an international communication system. No question of competition with Cable and Wireless was involved, nor would they lose any revenue. I explained that the King had given the Arabian Company permission to install the system provided that it was Company owned and controlled. Unless, therefore, the Company could make its own installation in Bahrein we would have to go back to the King to see whether he would approve any other arrangement, and this would take considerable time which especially under present conditions was most undesirable. Mr. Sabater suggested tentatively that the Arabian Company might purchase the necessary equipment, have it installed on the premises of Cable and Wireless in Bahrein, and then connect it to the Manama switchboard. This proposal, said Mr. Sabater, would in effect make the station in Bahrein Company owned and controlled but under agreement with Cable and wireless for the necessary operation and maintenance at some agreed figure. My reply was that the permission from the King of Saudi Arabia was probably not broad enough to cover the proposed arrangement. Major Munro promised to go into the matter immediately and let me know in a few days what was the best arrangement they could agree to. L. N. HAMILTON.6, Lothbury, London, E.G.2. May E4th, 1940. F-36. Mr. M. E. Lombard!, San Francisco. ?-2 V please refer to my letter F-3E of May 16th. TM s morning Mr. Sabater informed me over the telephone that on May 16th, the day I saw him, he cabled their man in charge of the Persian Gulf business, who is located at Karachi, asking him to get in touch with Bahrein and M to assist us in the direction we wanted'. No reply has yet been received, but another reminder has been sent to Karachi. I thanked Mr. Sabater for this information and added that under present conditions it was more than urgent to establish the desired communication. With this Mr. Sabater readily agreed. L. N.

' Referencecorrespondence resting with your Printed Lett r No, 392-8 dated the 12th June 1940 on the subject of radio telephonic comminication between Dhammam and Bahrain, [v * V ) m 2, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company seeking the permission of the Bahrain Government and, by implication, the permission also of His Majesty*s Government to instal a wireless telephonic set in their office at Awali for direct communication with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company* s headquarters in Dhahran. It has been explained to me that the reason for this new line of approach is the interminable delay which has ensued aince December 1938 when, on the advice of the India Office, negotiations were opened between the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and Cable and Wireless Limited, in London, (cf. iSndia Office Printed Let er Ho. P.Z. 8363 da^ed the 30th December 1938). The Oil Company 1 s representa tives inform me that these negotiations now rest with a statement K 3 ^ made at a meeting between the two Companies in May 1940 that Cable and Wireless Limited had instructed their Local Manager in Karachi to 'get in touch with Bahrain and to assist the California Arabian /- {Signature) S. (Designation)' s ' . r . xci Arabian Standard Oil Company in the direction Wey wanted'. As you are aware from my Express Letter No*. C/430 dated the 22nd May Cable and Wireless actually sought from me confirma tion that they would remain sole concessionaires for tele graphic work in Bahrain. 'V ' S. I have not of course consulted the Bahrain Government pending further instructions. The matter is of some complexi ty since on the one hand (a) it appears highly doubtful from your Express Letter No, S72-S dated the 6th June 1940 whether Cable and Wireless have in fact a monopoly position here, and (b) there are obvious benefits from our point of view in facilitating the establishment of direct wireless telephonic coimrainication between the two Oil CompaniesJ while on the other hand (a) there are equally obvious disadvantages in ini tiating the principle that oil companies in two separate territories may establish direct telephonic communication (cf. possibility of Petroleum Concessions Limited applying for similar facilities with Qatar, Kuwait, the Trucial Coast and possibly even Kirkuk) and (b) all external commnications, save those established for Service purposes in wfettee, should be concentrated in one organisation in order to avoid inter national complications. 4, I am however impressed by the importance, from the point of view of His Majesty's Government in wartime, of facilitating telephonic communication between Bahrain and Dhammam. The Bahrain Refinery is now able, subject to the availability of tankers, to dispose of one million barrels of refined products per month. To the best of my knowledge and belief the Bahrain field cannot safely produce more than a rough average of 20,000 barrels a day and the balance must therefore come from Arabia. A single company cannot operate efficiently without interior telephonic commnica- tion with its various branches, and it seems obvious that this /-u -.3.- this internal comnmnication must be expanded when the Compan, draws a considerable part of its crude supplies from another company. The possibility might also be borne in mind that as there is now considerable doubt whether a large refinery will ever be constructed at Ras Tanura the expansion of the Bahrain Refinery might conceivably result. It would almost certainly not result if inter-CoHtpany telephonic com munication were not assured. 5. It appears that direct negotiations between the two Companies have reached an impasse. The Oil Company have per mission from Ibn Saud to instal wireless telephonic communi cation with Bahrain only on condition that it communicates direct with the sister oiJt company in Bahrain. The object of Cable and Wireless Limited is to make commonication with any other organisation in Bahrain but their own an impossibili ty. It may, I think, be accepted that C.A.S.O.C. would have little hope of succeeding in any effort to induce Ibn Saud to modify his decision^ but on the other hand I am not aware what obligations His Majesty 1 s Government are under so far as Cable and Wireless are concerned. Possibly however these obligations would not extend to eausing His Majesty* s Govern ment to abandon Ihterests of their own merely to support a commercial company. It need not I think be feared that tele phonic commnication between the two Oil Companies will serve to diminish the revenue of Cable and Wireless in Bahrain and even in the very improbable event of there bing some minor loss Cable and Wireless could till regard with considerable satisfaction their immense takings from the two Oil Companies for cables to other parts of the world. 6. Possibly a solution might be found on the following lines. I have been informed that Ibn Saud insists on con trolling the proposed wireless telephone in Dhahran, that is to /-U-H 4 to say his own men would 'call' Bahrain for all conversa tions and would be able to listen in. Similarly on the Bahrain side His Majesty's Government, as controller of Bahrain's external communications, might well insist on controlling contacts with Dhahran and, for purposes of censorship in wartime, on listening in to conversations. His Majesty's Government might find it convenient to employ, at the Oil Company's expense, men provided by Cable and Wir ilessi and if the Bahrain installation were in the Oil Company's camp ibn Saud should not object to this arrangement. Admittedly such an arrangement is a little complisated, but not only might it well le found workable and so serve our interests as suggested in para graph 4 above ^but also by its very coi^exity it might appear an unattractive precedent to others with less important commercial interests here.

I believe I can help you concerning local radio transmission; to avoid cross purposes let me enumerate following essential facts I believe we must all proceed upon : First, movements of personnel now matter solely for British Government who will take all steps necessary to safeguard essential interests in Bahrain and prevent dis organised resignations. Second, refining at Bahrain of mainland oil concerns both Calarabian and Bahrain companies. Third, operations of Bahrain company embrace also those re quired for fulfilment of obligations under additional area concession when taken up and which may necessitate reliance upon mainland for special men and materials. Fourth, needs of Bahrain and Calarabian compa. ' ies may sometimes be inter locked but are not necessarily always the same. Fifth, transmissions by both companies must be confined within boundaries of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain archipelago. Sixth, we must expect to be compelled to consult with Cable and wireless or to bear their interests in mind to an extent necessary to safeguard that company from any financial loss it can demonstrate to be unreasonable for that company to assume: His Majesty's Govermient are largely interested in Cable and 'ireless Limited. Seventh, Imperial defence needs will /--2- will dictate especial conditions during existence of war. Eighth, io is vital to successful operation that Bahrain and Calarabian companies install on their own premises in Bahrain their own apparatus either severally or jointly- owned and to have unhampered 24 hours control of transmission subject only to reasonable safeguard imposed by all Govern- ments concerned and having re ard to safeguarding of whatever financial interest there may be of Cable and Wireless. What are your views regarding non-payment either of rent or rates to Cable and ..ireless ?

You are aware that we have applied for permission to operate a short-wave telephone communication system between here and our associated Company office in Bhahran, solely as a means of gaining effective coordination of our closely related operations at these two places. This letter is to inform you that we do now have a transmitter and receiver installed in our offices at Awali, for use when and if the requested permission is obtained and arrangements for censoring are completed; and to inform you that thisset has not been used since we completed our marine exploration work several months ago, and that it has never been used for communicating with Saudi Arabia or any other point outside the limits of our concession. When it is used it will be only in connection with our own internal operations and under strict executive supervision to insure that no conversations of an undesirable character are held. In connection with our application, I invite your attention to the fact that two days ago we were obliged to reduce our refinery throughput below its maximum capacity for the first time since the war began. This was because every tank was filled and no ships in to lift our products. The immediate reason for the shut down, from the operating view point, was that we have set aside one large tank for holding Admiralty fuel in readiness to avoid any delay such as was unfortunately necessary a few weeks ago; and that we must keep two large tanks in crude service to receive crude by tanker from Ras Tanura.PA-50. - £ - 73 17th August, 1940. n-p Perhaps nothing can be done about the first Mr I'nti®' can make the two crude tanks available Trhnw J th ® movement crude by barge from A1 fnr nL^ * ^ 7 J uttin S lights along the channel hauling and generally increasing the capacity t i sy |^ m t0 a llow discontinuance of the tanker • Ras Tanura to Sitra. This work was started everal days ago and should be completed shortly. it nnn^ US ar0 !^ nd ^ 30,000 for installation and about f 00,000 a year increased operating cost, compared to tanker movements, none of which can be justified if we f? n f u on ly our own commercial interests. I will add that the day before yesterday I cabled for and promptly r S C con e L^ U J horization t0 P ^ceed with the construction oi ccv,000 barrels additional storage. This represents an investment of about | 300,000 which will be without commercial value to us for a long time to come. This tankage, however, will not be available for six to ten months. I am most reluctant to proceed with night hauling from A1 Khobar until we have telephonic com munication established. We have already lost four employees lives between here and A1 Khobar directly because of lack of communication. The channel is dangerous even in daytime, because of reefs, currents and weather. Our barges are 20 years old and because of the gassy crude must be towed with long lines to avoid fire risk. Even with all daylight hauling they hang up on a bar or reef about twice a month. Under' present conditions we are willing to take unusual risks with our men and equipment, but urge that consideration be given to the efforts we are making. You know, of course, that we are dependent upon Arabia for more than one third of our regular crude throughput; that is, the Bahrein field is not capable of producing quite two-thirds of our present refining capacity. v.

Dear Sir, As you know, we have with the permission or the Acting P.A. and the S.N.O., 'been in radio-telephonic Gommunication with Casoc since the morning after the air raid. The radio messages fall in two groups :- 1) - Conversations ahout personnel matters, such as methods of evacuation, who is to 'be evacuated, and so on. These are extremely useful at present as an interchange of letters takes up to 48 hours. As soon as evacuation is conrpleted this method of communication may cease. 2) - A wave 'band from Casoc to Awali is constantly open for alarm purposes. All Casoc outstations have radio transmitting sets and in the event of anyone hearing or seeing aircraft A1 Khohar and Awali can 'be instantly warned. With luck we may get as much as half an hours warning of a raid: even a warning from Casoc headquarters would give us time to close down the Refinery and get our women into shelters. The S.N.O. and the A.L.O. have asked for any v &gt; such warning to 'be passed to them without delay. opinion.

Sir Reference correspondence on the subject cited above / resting with my Express letter No.T/llS-10/16 dated the 31st 2. After the air raid temporary and provisional permission was given by the Assistant Political Agent for the Oil Company in Bahrain to communicate with Dhahran by radio telephone in order (a) to obtain immediate information of damage done there and (b) to co-ordinate efforts of both Companies in securing transport for the evacuation of American women and children. The management of the Bahrain Petroleum Company at the time seemed able to think of little else but the instant removal of American wives and families and it was clear at the time th t they would not return to normal until some arrangements had been made. Evacuation will shortly be complete and communication for this purpose will cease. It was impossible at the time to arrange for the proper censoring of conversations between the two Companies but the Assistant Political Agent was kept fully informed /-- 2 . informed of what was being said and a warning was given that conversations should be strictly limited to the subject of evacuation arrangements and that movements and names ships other than neutral ships should not be mentioned• 3. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company at Dhahran are in constant communication with parties operating in the oil fieldty by means of radio telephone equipment. These parties who are often operating at considerable distances from Bhahran will be on the watch for aircraft in order to warn the Company 1 s headquarters at Dhahran* It is now known that the aircraft which carried out the raid approached from a westerly direction and it seems highly desirable that use should be made of these listening posts in Arabia in order to obtain some warning of an^ air raid on Bahrain, 4, It is therefore suggested that after evacuation arrange* ments have been completed permission should be given to the Bah rain i'etroleum Company to use their radio telephone equipment purely for alarm purposes.

As regards the risk that the Oil Company might exert covert pressure on the Shaikh as was the case in the negotiations for the Unallotted Area, this also appears somewhat unlikely since in that case there was the.question of a rival company entering the same field which Vvould naturally affect the Company much more quiokly than ixu the present case.

Dear Peel, ^ ^ Will you please refer to correspondence ending with Prior's telegram No.T.554, dated the 12th November 1940, dealing with the desire of the Bahrain Petroleum Oil Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to establish direct wireless aommunication between their offices in Bahrain and Dhahran respectively, Une argument which might have inclined us to view the proposal of the Oil Companies with favour was that California Arabian Standard Uil Company were thinking of constructing a refinery at Has Tanura and for the time it is not doubt true, as Prior points out in paragraph 4 of his telegram, that the recent Italian air raid has altered the position. Weverthless we feel that there are certain other considerations which deserve careful study on a longer view before it is decided rigidly to support the monopoly claim of Cable and Wireless iiimited. 2, it is presumably desirable on a long view to do everything possible in an endeavour to concentrate reiinery installations in Bahrain. Developments suggest that the potential output of the fields in Saudi Arabia is much greater than that of the Bahrain field and, if the oil companies are to concentrate refining in Bahrain, they will no doubt require some such inducement as is offered by an agreement to direct communication between Bahrain and the mainland by wireless. 3. Apart from this, although Cable and Wireless might hope to secure some additional revenue if this direct short- distance t -affic were partly in their hands, one must remember that, even if they agree to the oil companies , proposal, it would not divert any existing traffic which theyM - 2 - are handling and might indeed be expected to increase their traffic between Bahrain and the outside world. It is also conveivable that a completely nagatiwe attitude aaay result in their losing the monopoly position which they hold in respect of aaudi Arabia's coraaunications with the outside world under the agreement of 1935, which is terminaole after each five year. 1 ; 4. 'When all is said, policy in such a matter would appear to fall to be determined largely by theattitude with which we regard the entry of American oil interests into the Persian Gulf. There seems to us much to be said for the view that the presence of American oil companies in the ^ulf has strengthened the British position in those waters, and will do so even more if their main activities can be concentrated in Bahrain, which is after all a vailed protectorate. The oil companies are a hostage to fortune and their interests lie in the maintenance of the status quo . 1 remember, for instance, in 1934/35 in connection with the Arms Traffic convention, the United States (iovernment were induced to refrain from making an embarrassing reservation regarding an Iranian claim to sovereignty over Persian Gulf waters, and there was some reason to believe at the time that heir final attitude was mainly determined by the emergence of American oil interests in that area. 5. i am sending a copy of this letter to P^ior.

Lear Zambra, ■ t , i - , ^-'Q^eiaber a discussion last autumn between uaulo ek, .iirecess and Mr. Ballontyne (on behalf of the Banrein .otroleuia Company) and the California Arabian otandaru Oil Company) presided over by air Campbell ^tuart, regarding the Oil Conpany's scheme for vvireloss telephone communication between Bahrein and the neighbouring district of Rasa in saudi Arabia, do you hap pen to have any recent news o... the progress of this ■ question? My latest information was received from Ballantyne early in December and suggested that the parties .ere moving towards a settlement on the basis of the oil people, on consideration of certain payments to Cable &amp; wireless, having the right to use their own transmitting sets for communication with the mainland. Both sides were pparently ready to drop the original proposal of Cable &amp; tireless that all comraunications should pass through a central installation operated by Cable &amp; wireless and (probably) located on their premises. A point that may worry us, though it is hardly the concern of your Committee, is the question of censoring or otherwise controlling the oil Company's wireless communications with the mainland. At the outset we had thought this could be achieved by having the communications pass through the Central installation operated by Cable &amp;ire less. This now seems doubtful. In the discussion at whioh I was present Cable &amp; ..ireless made it a point that the central installation would not be a cause of delay and vt&gt; uld cuuse no interruption in, for example, a conversation between the Oil Company's office in Bahrein and one of their maialand stations.

E, His Britannic Majesty's PpJ^i^cal Agent Manama, Bahre in Dear Major Alban: During my recent visit I discussed with you the necessity for radio communication between Arabia and Bahrein in connection with the contemplated increase in barging of oil. For your reference in considering this subject I should like to summarize in letter form the facts that make such communication necessary. We have been advised by our principals in the United States that they expect to considerably increase h oil deliveries to Bahrein. It is our understanding that this constitutes an important contribution to the Allied war effort. The proposal contemplates producing Bahrein field at a maximum rate plus running increased quantities from Arabia. The expenditures necessary for our portion of the program have been approved and construction is well under way. The capacity of the pump stations and pipe lines between Dammam field and Lone Dune are designed to exceed the capacity of the marine equipment operating between Lone Dune and Zellaq. This marine equipment remains the definite choke point of the whole system. This restric tion is further aggravated by the fact that the barges and launches that tow them are old, and considerable de lays can be anticipated due to breakdowns and routine overhauls in addition to the usual delays caused by bad weather. In order to get maximum capacity out of existing marine equipment, it is planned to Institute a procedure of closely scheduling and correlating barge operations on a 24 hour per day basis with-each unit shuttling back and forth as rapidly as possible and normally making a couple of round trips daily. We cannot carry out these closely scheduled operations either efficiently or safely without direct communication between Arabia and Bahrein.We wish to obtain approval to install radio equipment permitting direct 24 hour per day three-way- radio coOTnunication between Dhahran end Awali, Dhahran and launches, and Awali and launches. We would expect to operate on such wave lengths as to avoid interference with operations of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., and British Overseas Airways Corp, The use of the radio would be restricted to a few carefully selected staff men, and would be restricted to vital coimunications related to the oil movement, especially the dispatching and arri vals of barge units and reporting of trouble therefrom. It is needless to sa3r that we wish to do everything pos sible to further the Allied war effort and -would care fully avoid any mention of ship movements in or out of the Persian Gulf, May we urge that you expedite the approval of this radio communication as much as possible, as we wish to have the installation of the radio equipment completed by the time the new oil handling facilities are ready for operation, which should be in about three months.

Alban, O.B.I., His Britannic Majesty 1 s Political Agent, Bahrein. 4^ %V|f Dear ifejor Alban: Mr. F. W. Ohliger wrote to yom on December 23rd 1941 on tbe question of radio communications to be installed and operated between Arabia and Bahrein. In his letter Mr. Ohliger states very clearly the necessity for such communication. If the program of increasing crude runs in Bahrein becomes effective we will undoubtedly have to have means of direct communication. As this is an 'all out' war, both of our organizations feel that we must have the facilities to give us maximum protection and assurance of close coordination in the delivery of products to this island that are considered essential to the war effort. The question of radio communication is a long outstanding problem - we have been trying for the past five years to get some suitable means of communication. Now that the question has become one of vital necessity we would appreciate anything that you can do to obtain a favourable decision on this matter. Yours very truly, M. H. Lipp Chief Local Representative, The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. MHL:SWfl3- Telegram S From Political Agent, Bahrain Political Resident, Bushire No. 511 Dated the 29th December 1941. General Managers of Bahrain Petroleum Company and California Arabian Standard Oil Company have explained to me that they have received advice from principals that oil production is to be increased to approximately 60,000 barrels per day of which 35,000 will be shipped across in barges from Bas Tanura to Zellaq and rest produced in Bahrain. 2. Barges v /ill work day and night and both companies request permission to institute direct radio telephonic communication between Arabia and Bahrain without which efficiency and safety of operations would be endangered. 3. Proposal would permit direct 24 hour per day three way radio communication between Dhahran and Awali and launches. Would operate on such wave lengths as to avoid interference with Cable and Wireless and British Overseas Airways Corporation. Use would be restricted to a few carefully selected staff men and to vital coramu nications related to oil movements and barges. Great care would be taken to avoid mention of ship movements in Persian Gulf etc. 4. Agreement with Cable and Wireless does not seem to have materialised, vide India Office telegram No.1352 of 8th February. Oil is for war pjrposes and t P.T.Opermission as above be accorded forthwith un^ix necessity has ceased and censorship be dispensed wi^h on Company's assurance. - Political -Telegram S, Prom Political 'Resident, on board 'Nearchus' To Secretary of State for India, London.

Since shipments from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain are being increased from 7,000 to 35,000 barrels 1 recom mend facilities requested by oil companies be allowed forthwith subject to following stipulations : (a) that concession is for duration of war only and is subject to revision or cancellation at any time Cb) that two oil companies should either before or after the grant of facilities come to a settlement with Cable and Wireless regarding the latter's claims /-lit 2 claims (cf. India Office telegram No. 1352 dated the 8th February 1941) and (c) that the Bahrain Petroleum Company should comply with any censorship requirements we choose to make. 4. According to the Bahrain Petroleum Comoany Saudi Government have agreed to telephonic communication between stations of two companies (vide paragraph No.4 of Hesidency Express letter No. 558-3 dated July 30th 1940 to India Office, Government of India and Bahrain only); and Shaikh of Bahrain is unlikely to raise any objection. 5. Companies have all equipment necessary which can be installed as soon as permission is given.——itMoim iioiw, \ ^ cmammh e bahkt®®, Corsfictential* mtmt, ■ ,0.2* ISth ;'u3 v -, 19U.

Dear Mr. Bellantyne, j^ J \ h 4 I iiave now heard furtiior 1'rom Sir Edward Wilahew, wlio se^s that whil© he will he prepared ta agree that all the auplioati-ns of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Bahrein -Petroleum Companj should be suspended for the period of the war, he is not yet clear about the position. The point which apparently is not clear is that he understands that the small portable a ete heve already been used for ooanunication with the iiiQrinland, and he would therefore be glad if you could obtain some definite information of the wireless activities which the two oil companies would propose to undertake from now on. I think perhaps the point could be cleared up if you could give me.an interpretation of the sixth mrt i'.-raph in your letter of the 4th Deo ember to Mr. Gil. son, in which you say '1 think confusion has arisen from the ' fact that Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. knew nothing of the power of these two Companies to use portable sets for the purposes of their local operations ana that they were, in fact, using such sets ......' 'Msinterpretation of this was that the Bahrein petroleum Company uses portable setu within the co,fines of Bahrein, and that the California Arabian tandotd Oil Company uses portable sets on the mainland of Saudi Arabia, but that there was, and is at present, no communication by means of these portable setdbetween Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. Sir Edward Wilshaw apparently is not sure whethe the phrase in your letter of the 24th April, 1941, para graph (d), in which you say that you imagine^that the two Companies would go on as hitherto, namely, confine themselves to wireless for local operations, each Company within itdbwnsphere of influence..definitely means that there would be no suggestion of communicating by the portable wireless sets between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. i/ *THl BAR-, aiiPETfiDLHOM COMPACT LlMIf 11, Biroliirj Lane, London, 1,0.3 in 1 ) you from the first paragruph of your letter under r^)ly? I thought I had suggested that it mi^ht he much more satisfactory to the (Jovernment if Companiea suspended their applications during the war, thus short-circuiting the need to go into the question of oafeguards and also relievini the Authorities of acy need to trouble ah out the control ql International comnunicatioiiB between Bahrain and audi Arabia. fhat is what I really meant* If ny suggestion were accepted, then I should put both the safeguards asked for and ay suggestion up to jay companies for instructions, urging acceptance of ny rscomiendation. I'o reply to the questions put (a) Tea, the original applio«tion was by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, and following the meeting which took place on the iJSth, Iwveaiber, 1940, the application then took the form of one from the Bahrein petroleum Company limited to use its small portable wirelese sat.., both on land and sea, for communication with the Mainland. . . (b) Had we proceeded beyond the discussion of the safeguards required by Government, I was going still further to modify the application by making it a .Joint one on behali of-both of these Companies for the use uf portable sets on land and sea. (c) Sir Campbell Stuart's understanding at our last meeting ia quite correct in that this application (the exact form of which I did not go into then) should be suspended. In other words, as I put it to Sir Campbell Stuart, I thuught it would be much better for all parties conoor. ed if the whole matter were suspended until after the end of the War, («)/1# \ c v /a) I o&amp;miut Sfigr precisely what wirsless activitios (if bm?) the two Oil Companies propoee to maintain.

Deane this date, and the information requested 'by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, was handed to Commander King and his W/T expert, who was called in. The inrorraation presented is attached. It was the wireless rating's opinion that the frequencies that we proposed to use would not interfere with any of the frequencies now regularly used 'by themselves or the E.A.I 1 ., who have just recently established wireless facilities at Bahrein. The only possible conflict that he mentioned was our frequency 3287 K.C. They had recently experimented with a frequency of 3285 K.C. which would conflict with this, 'but he said this experimental freauency did not work out very satisfactorily and he was satisfied that it could 'be dropped. We pointed out that 3287 K.C. was an important frequency for us 'because of the number of crystals we have on hand for operation on this frequency. After this, Commander King was told the following:- (1) - that communications would 'be required 24 hours per day. (2) - that the requirement for the communication was 'based on the oil 'barging 'between Lin J a and Zellaq, which would 'be increased for purposes of helping the war effort, to almost double the present capacity. (3) - that it is required as a safety precaution in handling personnel 'between the two sides, and (4) - for notification in case of enemy action in Arabia. It was further stated that only staff personnel would have access to our sending and receiving equipment and that would be limited to a selected few staff personnel in the Arabian organization, and as far as Bahrein was concerned to men in the Secretarial staff of the Management. We further stated that we would at all times be co-operative with them in changing any wave length on which conflict might develop. We strongly stressed the necessity for reasonably quick approval for this service to be commenced.n 1 • Types of W/T and E/T eguipment to 'be used are : - (a.) - Awali Transmitter - Heinz &amp; Kaufman - Type 951 B 59 watt radio telephone transmitter with provision for W/T working 125 watts on Receiver - Hammerlund.)

Eadio Comniunication - Bahrein and AraMa. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, BAHREIN. Dear Sir, The Bahrein Petroleum Oonrpany Limited ao^nowledges with appreciation your confidential letter 4th April, 1942. The Company is anxious to obtain a clear understanding of the stipulations under which the concession is granted 'before institution of direct radio communication with their associated Company in Aratda, and will 'be most grateful for clarification of the following points : - (1) - Would the concession granted for the use of radio telephony preclude the use of W/T in the event of unexpected 'bad weather, atmospheric conditions and emergencies, particularly such as would endanger the lives of personnel if W/T were prohibited entirely? (2) - The provisions in paragraph (c) of your letter with respect to the power of the apparatus to 'be used, Implies, though vaguely, the stipulation that communication with launches shall 'be limited to communication with those on the waters 'between Bahrein and Dhahran. It is taken as o'bvious that no such implication was intended for the reason that it would 'be inconsistent with the rights granted to the Company under Article IV'('b) of the Deed of Further Modification, dated 19th June, 1940. This Deed grants to the Company the right to construct and operate radio facilities for the purpose of its 'business, except that radio equipment may not 'be used to transmit messages 'beyond the limits of the concession, which includes the lands, islands, shoals, reefs, waters and submerged lands comprising the Shaikh's present and future dominions as defined in Article II (a) and ('b) of the a'bove mentioned Deed. The Company has installed the necessary radio equipment for the purpose and have 'been exercising this right for a long while within their own Bahrein concession■ .CQK-995. - 2 - 6th April, 1942. and with no history of interference. They therefore contenrplate using this same equipment for communication v/ith AraMa. Paragraph (c)(i) of your letter provides that conversation will he confined to matters connected with the launches and 'barges service with no mention permitted of shipping, air or troop movements, mails or oil developments. It is agreed that these or any other matters will not 'be mentioned in a manner that would he of interest or assistance to the enemy/ 'but in the interest of the safety of personnel and to facilitate the operations for which the service is desired, limited and ohscure conversation pertaining to personnel and affairs of the Company, except those ahove mentioned, is most desirable, particularly in event of emergencies, such as existed immediately following the air raid of October 1940. Therefore, permission for such conversation is requested 'by the Company. The Company recognises and appreciates under present circumstances your desire for limited conversation and right of censorship over such communications and would 'be receptive to any reasonable demand to that end; such as paying a reasonable fee for a censor assigned to super* vision of conversations at their station, or they will assign for supervision such of their staff as you approve and limit conversation to a few carefully selected staff sanctioned by you. The frequencies approved are satisfactory. However, it appears 3537 kc/s indicated in your letter should be 3537.5 kc/s as this is the only exception to the frequencies chosen as being the most likely to be acceptable to all concerned, as mentioned in letter PA-37 to you of 17th March, 1942. ¥ill you kindly confirm whether the frequency should be 3537 or 3537.5 kc/s. (3) - In paragraph (d) of your letter reference is made to claims of Cable &amp; Wireless Limited. In previous correspondence on this subject it has been assumed and implied, without reference to evidence of foundation, that Cable &amp; Wireless Limited hold exclusive privileges granted them in Bahrein. If the alleged claims of Cable &amp; Wireless are based on exclusive privileges granted them, would you kindly advise by what competent authority the privilege was granted, and when, i.e. the date, for what period of time the privilege extends, and cite for the Company documentary evidence of the same in order that they may approach Cable &amp; Wireless Limited with the object of reaching settlement of such valid claims as actually exist.CON-995. - 3 - 6th April, 1?^ 1942. In the event that the claims of Ca'ble &amp; Wireless Limited are predicated on an assumption of financial loss, or that the estatlishment of other communication, solely for the purpose of co-ordinating local operating routine, would diminish their source of revenue, then their claims are without foundation. The increased activities of the Company, which make intercommunication service so vitally necessary, will directly result in an increase of 'business, already substantial, given Ca'ble &amp; Wireless Limited 'by the Company. The proposed intercommunication service would take nothing from Ga'ble &amp; Wireless that they now have, 'but instead would augment their possibilities of increased revenue. It will 'be a service for which their system is not adaptable and cannot be practicably adapted. That these things are true is evidenced by the fact that for several years now they have known of the Company^ desire to establish this service and have not seen fit to install or provide the necessary equipment for this purpose and it is our understanding they are not in a position to do so now. The facilities for intercommunication hag now become to the Company a vital necessity, the further delay of which not only jeopardises the safety of personnel but also the continuous capacity operations carried out by the Company, which have been recognised as vital to the war effort. In order that the necessary arrangements for the establishment of this service, for which the Company has already installed facilities, may be brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date, your early reply to the foregoing will be very much appreciated.

(2) - The proposed service would augment their (Cable Wireless Limited) possibilities of increased revenue as the increased activities for which the service is so necessary contemplates increasing the daily average crude capacity of the Refinery to something of the order of 40,000 to 55,000 'barrels per day as compared to approximately 33,000 'barrels per day present capacity and involves a corresponding increase in production and shipping. Approximately 25% of the Company's cable business at present pertains to shipping and it is therefore suggested as reasonable to assume that a substantial increase in routine cable business pertaining to these operations will result. Facilities, of ishich radio telephony would become an integral part, contemplated to take care of increased activities have already been installed at a cost of approximately 1250,000 and immediately plans under consideration are approved, other installations and alterations will be made.,v ; ■ StANDaRD OIL GoMPflNlT Dhahran, Saudi Arabia April 19, 1942 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S POLITICAL AGENT Manama, Bahrein Dear Sir: Your letter C/419,vriiich informs us that permission has been granted to install telephonic radio communication between Bahrein and Dhahran, is acknowledged herewith, and I wish to express our appreciation of the assistance that you have given and for the cooperation that has been shown on all sides. ,H 1 ' We are prepared to meet the stipulations listed in letter C/419, namely: (a) that it is understood that the concession is confined to radio telephony; (b) that it is for the duration of the war only and is subject to revision or cancellation at any time; (c) that the power of the apparatus used will not be more than that sufficient for communication between Bahrein and Dhahran, and with, launches on the waters between the two places, that its use will be confined to a few carefully selec ted staff and that the following restrictions will be observed in operation: (i) the conversations will be confined to matters connected with launches and barges service; no mention will be made of shipping, air or troop movements, mails or oil developments; (ii) copies of orders issued by my Company and the names of the officials entitled to use radio telephony will be forwarded to you, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian G-ulf, and the Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrein; (iii) only the following frequencies will be used viz. 6575 kc/s, 5050 kc/s, 3537 kc/s, and 3287 kc/s; and(iv) silence will be enforced immediately on receipt of orders from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. The Bahrein Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standrad Oil Company have been endeavoring for a number of years to arrange radio communication between Awali and Dhahran, but efforts to come to an agreement with Cable and Wireless Limited have not been successful. The installa tion of crude oil handling facilities at Al Aziziyah in Saudi Arabia and at Zellaq in Bahrein as a project in support of the war effort makes such communications urgent. The need for close scheduling of the movement of crude oil by barges between the two terminals and the part played by radio com munication has been explained in previous discussions and correspondence. Communication between Awali and Dhahran is very necessary to the project of transporting oil, and because the California Arabian Standard Oil Company does not wish to delay inauguration of telephonic radio communication between the two points, it will accept stipulation (d), which is as follows: 'that your Company and the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited will reach a settlement with Cable and Wireless Limited regarding the latter's claims, and that if you fail to do so the whole position may have to be recon sidered.' but on the understanding that: (a) such acceptance is not construed as an admission, explicit or implicit, of the existence of any right claimed by Cable and Wireless Limited, and (b) that if no settlement be reached with Cable and Wireless Limited when the occasion arises that Cable and Wireless Limited will not be entitled to any fees or payment by way of damage, compensa tion or otherwise in respect of such direct com munication by radio telephony as may, up to that time, have taken place. Will you kindly confirm that, in view of the foregoing, we may inaugurate telephonic radio communicption as renuested. Yours very truly, CALIFORNIA ARABIAN STANDARD OIL COMPANY N J |^ v .Telegram 3.

Both companies accept stipulations (a-J (b-' and (c). They accept stipulation (d) on understanding (1) that such acceptance is not construed as admission explicit or implicit of the existence of any right claimed by Cable and Wireless, and (ii) that if no settlement is reached with Cable and Wireless the latter Company will not be entitled to any fees or payment by way of damages compensation or otherwise in respect of such direct communication as may already have taken place. 2. I consider that conditions laid down by Companies are unobjectionable and necessary for their own protection.

Similar orders will be issued by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company shortly. After con sultation with the Bawal Officer in Charge, Bahrain, I have accorded approval to the issue of these ordsrs. 3. The last paragraph of the orders raises an issue on which I shall be glad to have early instructions. From time to time emergencies srise when it would be invaluable for me to get into immediate touch with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. For example, the 10th ^rmy recently asked for the lamedlate presence of isr.Snyder, Chief Knginaer, California wyuiw.bhArabian Standard Oil Company ingB^Bd. I received a signal from the 10th Army on the evening of one day, and Mr.Snyder was required to travel by a flying boat leaving Bahrain au 1»30 p«£U on the following day. The necessary arrangements were made - but with the greatest difficulty and with much inconvenience to all concerned. Recently the immediate aid of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company had to be invoked in the search for R .A .P. aircraft which had been forced down on the Saudi Arabian coast and it was thought that personnel might have been injured. If direct communication had been permissible on that occasion many valuable hours would have been saved. Such instances will recur in the future, probably with increased frequency. 4. The Naval Officer in Charge also finds it necessary occasionally to get an urgent message through to the Califor nia Arabian Standard Oil Company. I suggest, therefore, that I should be given discretion, in cases of emergency, to authorise the transmission of messages outside the limited scope allowed to the Companies; and that, similarly, the Companies should not be held to be infringing their under takings if they use their apparatus from time to time to transmit messages at the specific request of the Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain.

The operating instructions issued by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company are on similar lines to those issued by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. But para 7 is deserving of particular notice as it implies that the Resident Manager of the Company is at liberty, in the event of emergency, to break the conditions subject to which permission to establish radio te^£phonic communication was granted. Acceptance of this position is obviousl open to objection on grounds of principle. But in practice I thini it essential that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company should in emergency, be in a position to communicate direct with Bahrain. For example, it is possible that a California Arabian Standard Oil s '/ Company MFP—1206 8&amp;P—(M-1723)—4-2-36—200,000. 47Company field party might see and report by field wireless to Dhahran hostile aircraft approaching, or R.A.F, aircraft making forced landings or crashing. It would he intolerable if, in such circumstances, Dhahran were unable to communicate with Bahrain, I suggest therefore that, in order to ensure that the Resident Manager does not without proper cause and full justification disregard the undertakings by which his Company is bound, he should report to me particulars of all cases in which he issues orders under para 7 of the operating instructions and such particulars would in turn be reported by me to you and to the Secretary of State for India.0.

They appeal instead to H.K.G. to support their interests. It Is true 'a© say that no •rights'* of Gable and ireleso would be infringed by allowing The Oil Company to operate a private system of %fireiess comuaicatior between Bahrein and Saudi rabia, not extending beyond the bounds of those two countries and confined to the legitimate business of the Conpany, It is also true, as contended by ne Oil Company, that this would not constitute any encroachment on the traffic which Gable and Wiralasa expected to handle when they took over in Bahrein# On the other hand the political resident is certainly right in saying that we should have objected to the grant of a concession to another telef-raph company so long as the Indo-^uropeaa Telsgraph Depar^inent maintained the telegraph office in Bahrein, further, we should naturally uphold the interests of Gable and tireless against a competing telegraph company and, notwithstanding the inforraal nature (vide the f.? . Political Agent's letter of let July) of the assurance claimed to have been given to Cable and ireless in 1938 by the local political authorities to the effect that . their position in Bahrein was adequately safeguarded under the resent British control, we should not dispute the view that the Company have hitherto counted upon and received our support in Bahrein. The question is whether it would be consistent with this general relationship between Cable and Wireless and ourselves for us to countenance the Oil Company 's proposals.

Dear Peel, ) Vith reference to r:iy letter of the SSrd March about direct radio telephone coirmmnica11 on between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia for the two American oil companies. Sir Edward l/ilahaw has now ecknov/ledgad the letter we wrote to him informing him of what had been decided. After expressing regret at the decision, he states that he wishes to place on record that this concession runs counter to the assurances given by the political Agent at Bahrein in regard to Cable and Wireless Limited 1 s telecommunication rights in Bahrein, on the basis of which they have been working in the island, sines on the recommendation of such Political Agent the Company has not been able to proceed with its intended application for a direct concession from the Sheikh, Sir Edward Wilshaw also enquires what measure of control it is intended to exercise in Bahrein for the purpose of preventing the oil companies from communicating either redio-telegraphically or radio-telephonically with places outside Bahrein other than in Saudi Arabia, J As regards Sir Edward's first point, perhaps the Political Resident and Agent could be consulted as to whether the time is opportune for the question of a direct concession to be raised again, or for some specific assur ance to be given in regard to the general position of Cable and ireless Limited in Bahrein? * As regards his second point, I suppose the answer is that if any evidence of abuses of the concession is forthcoming the Political Agent is in a position to with draw the concession.

KING, D.S.O,, R.K.V.R., Naval Officer in Coiaraand, Jufair, Bahrein Bear Ooramandar King: '■This letter will confirm the conversation between yourself and Messrs. »4air and Snyder at Jufair on July 22 In regard to interference en assigned radio frequency 6575 Kc, At the time the assigninent of radio frequencies was discussed with Commander Quick at Awali several months ago, we pointed out that the only frequencies for which we had a substantial number of crystals was 4615, 6575, and 3287 kc. Of these it would be necessary that we retain two on account of the difference in atmospheric conditions between day and night transmission and the number of Company stations within iaudi Arabia we wanted to put on the same frequencies. The 4615 kc frequency had been found nost satisfactory for all around use, and we had more than double the number of crystals for this frequency as for any other. Oomnander Quick said that 4615 kc. had been reserved as a fixed crystal frequency for the R.A.if, and so was unavailable. He said certain naval stations were using 6575 kc, but that their transmitters were not crystal controlled and could readily be shifted to one side, which he said he would try to arrange. We have found that 6575 kc, is the best frequency for daytime transmission from Bahrein to Bhahran, but that the W /T interference on this frequency has gradually built up to viiere it is almost unusable for H/T service. Stations that are par ticularly bad in causing interference are VTR, VIP4, VTJ', OSV, and others whose call letters m have not picked up so far. We believe most of these stations belong to the British military forces. Will you please find out from Commander Quick whether these stations can be shifted to one side. If not will you please find out whether changed conditions ml|£it not make it nosslble for us to drop 6575 kc, and use 4615 kc. Instead. (Since the Awall-Bhahran communication service was Inaugurated, we have discontinued using 4615 kc. for our operations within Saudi Arabia. However, we recently checked it and found it still free from interference.) If you find 4615 kc, is avail able, we will take the matter of obtaining approval of this change in frequency up with Mr, akefield.

We are grateful to you for your assistance in establishing this communication system, and we appreciate your following through on this question of special author ization for the use of the radio telephone to Bahrein. CTpon three occasions recently we have authorized depart ure from the Operating Instructions. The particulars of each case were as follows. On Friday, May 21st, Major Stanley Hills and Capt. M. Dixon were becalmed while pleasure sailboating off the coast to the south of our Aziziyah terminal. They came ashore in the late evening end spent the night with us. I authorized a message to advise Mrs. Dixon and Captain Young^ that Hills and Dixon were safe. yM' ^ On Saturday, May 22nd, there was an exchange of com munications to enable us to make arrangements for the arrival of the party of General Hurley as well as arrangements for the landing of the party's aeroplane at Dhahran.

I authorized a special mes sage to Squadron Leader W. A. Chase at Bahrein to advise him that the plane and personnel were safe.

At the time of the installation of the Radio-Telephone service permission was given to the Arabian American Oil Company and the Bahrain Petroleum Company for its use subject to certain conditions as it involved questions of censorship security, war time restrictions, and the leeal contractual rights of Messrs. Cable and wireless Limited. The Companies have general permission to use the Radio-Telephone service at fixed times only and that for communicating on certain particular subjects relating tc the movements of their oil barges and launches. 3. However, in cases of particular emergencies I have been empowered to authorise the use of the Radio-Telephonic system to transmit messages other than the movements of launches, etc. These special authorisations made by me have to be reported to higher authority periodically, 4. I have been instructed to inform you that there is no objection tc your using the Radio -Telephone for messages of grave urgency but the prior permission of this Agency must be obtained and X must be furnished with a copy of the message it is desired to despatch.

In this connection, it seems that Lt. Commander Webster had asked that this signal be sent.

On Friday, August 14th, at lunch time, Mr. Reynolds of CASOC rang me up and informed me that 6 Americans attached to the American Military Mission at Cairo had arrived here from Basra at mid-day on a U.S. Army Transport »Plane (without sending any previous intimation of their coming,) to inspect certain CASOC equipment, rolling stock, cranes etc., with a view to buying.it for the American Army. They were apparent ly not aware that this equiQpment was not in Bahrain or that there would be any difficulty over their seeing it. ThCey had to leave here the following morning, and therefore to go to Dhahran that afternoon. They produced a letter of authority from the American War Department of which a Copy is below. As ordinary methods of commnication with DhCahran would have involved considerable delay, the daily launch from Bahrain having already left, I gave permission for the message attached to be sent by R/T. We should report this case some time, in accordance with page 227 of. File 10/15. I think (unless we have any previous cases not yet reported) the best thing to do would be to wait until, say, the 9th or 10th of September and I will then report this case, together with any others that may occur before P.A.•s return. ltd.
