To The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office Sir, / With reference to your letter of the 20th January re garding the status of Koweit, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affail's, copy of telegrams the Farl of Crewe concurs in the opinions expressed by Lieut enant Colonel Cox and the Government of India. The necessary conditions antecedent^ to any concession on the part of his Majesty’s Government with regard to the status of ^oweit appear to him to be:- (1) the securing for uia Majesty’s Government of pre dominant control in the Baghdad-noweit section of the Bagh dad hallway, for which purpose he considers 55^ of capital and control inadequate. ( 2 ) a bidding assurance that x».oweit will be the terminus (3) the obsolute control, jointly with the Sheikh, of the harbour and port both afloat and ashore. (4) a satisfactory agreement between the Sheikh and the Turkish uovernment as to the division of Customs and transit duties. In return for this. His Majesty’s Government might admit, and advise the Sheikh to admit, Turkish suzerainty over xxoweit to the full extent compatible with:- (a) the complote autonomy of uoweit in respect of its internal administration, to be guaranteed by a firman to the Sheikh, and confirmed by a written undertaking to miq Majesty’s Go vernment, as proposed by Colonel u ox: (b) the maintenance of our agreements with the ^heikh: (c) the recognition e£ by Turkey of Urn hasr, Bubiyan, and &lt;Varba as part of xvoweit torri- exchanged with the Government of India. vj° ^ ^ To India dated the 16th February. 0 I am to say that From India, dated 23rd February torytory under lurkiali suzerainty, and the withdrawal of Turkish guards and symbols of authority therefrom. A reasonable settlement of all property disputes, the bheikh taking out lurkish papers for his son, should also be included in the negotiations: and it would further be understood that if the question of tribute is not raised the bheikh will ap proach the division of customs duties, etc., in a liberal spirit• Whether the Turkish vzovernment will be prepared to nego tiate on this basis will presumably depond largely ypon the value which they attach to considerations mainly of a senti mental order. On the other hand, the concession which His Majesty* s Government are prepared to makr, in facilitating the use of ivoweit as a terminus for the Baghdad railway, is of a very substantial nature: and in considering what we may reasonably expect to receive in return it must be borne in mind that the position which His Majesty*s Government have built up for themselves at koweit, and fortified by formal agreements with the Sheikh, is - together with the similar position which they htbld at Mohammerah - the one solid asset that they possess in those regions, and that they have been at pains to acquire it precisely for some such purpose as that to which it is now proposed to put it, quite apart from all question of compensation, this same position makes it impossible for them ( as Mr.darling has pointed out in his despatch Ho.14 of 4th January last) to abandon the °heikh to the Turks without such a loss of prestige as would be di sastrous to their general policy and interests in the Persian ^ulf. i^’or these reasons Lord Crewe would regard the conditions recapitulated above as essential to a satisfactory settlement. It is clear that in any negotiations that may be opened great care must be taken to avoid mailing any admissions with regard to the statu s of r^oweit that may be used to our detriment should the whole negotiations provo abortive, or should some place other than ^oweit eventually be adopted as the teminus.a In concluaioft I am to expi'oas tha hope that any opportuni ty that offare may bo taken to dispose of the other outstanding questions referred to in my letter of the 30th December, 1910. / / &lt;\ (signed) I have etc., R.

CONPIDRNTIAL • Hie Ma.jeyty^ Government have not failed to give their careful attention to the important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last fr* m the Ottoman Govern -ment. interwoven that they cannot be settled independently the one of the other, have , for the purpose of convenience , been set forth under three disticnt headings (l) The Baghdad Railway question, i1 *) Tho respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in -ted Mr conditions under which they would favour the partici- -I ation of British caj ital in this enterprise ; and, while it is not n^w jro^osed o recapitulate the earlier stages of this question , it may be recalled that in July 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister of Finance, woh way hen in Lr don, it was intimated that an arrangement secure ” 1 K r interests a representation of 55 per cent of the whole in regard to the Gui&lt;f sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution,—and, having regard to the These proposals though they affect interests so closely the region of the Persian Gulf, (iii) An increase from llper cent to 15 per cent ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (ij The Baghdad Railway Question , On various occasions His Majesty f s Government have indicesthe sreat rrer*riderance of certain interests in nther sections of the line , such a iro^ortion cannot be well looked njor as exces ive 9 esrecially if the threat extent of British trade in these regions and the vast tonnage of British shirrinE are Boib in roird* Since tha ar ancient laid before Djavid Bey rerresented a lart-;© measnre of concession on the part of His Majesty’s Gov- -ernment , they have received the suggestions now roade by the Ottoman Government with some surprise* The Turkish proposals for the final portions of the rai -way are that a new comxany should be formed , that the cajital should be divided between the Ottoman Government , who would receive 40 per cent of the whole, and British , French , and German groups , who would each receive 20 per cent* The detail of the finanacial arrangements are left for subsequent settle- -ment between the parties interested* His majesty’s Government regret that they are unable to accept these projosals * If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Baghdad , and if it is to be f constituted on an international basis His majesty’s Government ca^ only accede to such an arrangement Xrovided that British interests are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other power including Turkey, and in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the inter- -national and commercial character of the undertaking , they would suggest that Russia should be admitted to participation and that the percentage alioted to each country should be 20 I er cer t* Assuming that this distributio is adopted , His Majesty Government consider that a Convention should be concluded by he Rowers concerned providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey , and for equality of % treatment in regard to transrort facilities and connate mattermatte pa ; for the alignment of the Railway yonth of Baghdad and the conditio* under which it iy to be constrncted ; and the in- -treduction of ap. roved finanacial arrant;ementy tendint; to foy- -ter ///d^'/ the develoj'em nt of traffic; and fop guaranteeing that the intereat in the entorx'riae of the several parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to ter- -mination on -the expiry of the Baghdad Railway Concession* I' would be furthermore necessary for the Ottoman Govern- -raert to undertaike formally rot to impose river dues on Bri- -tish shipping or cargoes without the consent of His Ma r esty^s Government # There remains the uestion of the terminal port; having regard^to he fact hat important commercail interests are al- -readv established in Bassorah * His Maiesty f s Government canno but feel that substantial advantages would accrue from the est- -ablishment of the terminus at that point; and they consider that the port should be constructed and controlled by the ; ro- -posed new company in the interets of the unrestricted commerce f al? 7 a -ions* But if such an arrangement is adopted* thay must stipulate that , in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Kuwait u^der conditio* to be settled by agreement between Great Bri- - air ad Turkey alone* and a clause to that effe ct must be embodied in a convention dealing with these matters. «&gt; ) The respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Region of the Persian Gulf* His Majesty»s Government are willing to meet the wish ex- -pressed in *he concluding paragraphs of the Turkish memorandum '.hat a precise definition may be reached as to the respective I oyitr r r* +he two countries , commercially and politically, ir the Persian Gulf; and they see no reason whuy a lasting set -tiement of the questions involved should not be reached * His Majesty's Government are in no sense opjosed to the legitimate claims of 'he Turkish Government * The most southerly joint to— ■tn which they have evor recngriaed ynch clairos cn the littnral of the Persian Gulf is Or'air • in the district of A1 Katif. South of this r c int there is no trace of TTirkish power ever having been i lararaonnt ; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs conveyed to His Majesty’s Ambassador for- -mal assiirances that the Sublime Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrain, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf; and it is only since that date that certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman G r vernroent to establish mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at joints to the south of ojair. The position of His Ma.iestyts Government in regard to these tribes has been ntiroly different* With Bahrain they have had direct relations since 1805 ; these relations have t found concrete oxjression in a series of treaties dating from 1820 , and having as their objects the sujpression of piracy and the slave trade; the regularity of the succession to the throne: the protection of the island against foreign aggres ion and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrain is the centre* In Muscat and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs HI His Majesty is Government have , in virtue of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years; and their policy in each case has been inspired by the importance * of ujholding the maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce of all cotintries, and of protecting the long est- -ablished interests of British-Indian subjects* His Ma-esty f s Government cannot acquiesce in any are -rangement which might restrict or undermine the authority whih they have exercised uniteruj jtedly with such beneficent results; thev conceive that any extension of Turkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of o.iair would be prejudicial to those results and unsup T orted by any legiti- -mate claims of Turkish sovereignty ; and they have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encroach uponuron those regions* They are therefore of opinion that any la^tlnt; Bettleirent between the two Powers ^ust provide for the definite ronunoiation by the Ottoman Government of Bahrain « and adjacent islands and the whole of the Peninsula of El Katr (including El Bidaa), where the Shaikh of Bahrain has important rights; and they consider that such a settlement would remove a perjrenial source of local friction* The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of Koweit to-wards the Ottoman Emiire, ard His Majest Government will gladly contribute to such a solution , on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be re- -garded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward , should such proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government is aware. His Maesty^s Gov- -ernment have never admitted that Koweit is under Turkish pro- -tection, and inasmuch as some divergence of ppinion was mani- -fested betw en the two Governments as to the position there, a modus vivendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty*s Government cors enting to t^ive an as urance that, j rovided the Turkish Government abstained from sending troops to Kuwait and respected the status quo there, they would not occupy that plac^ or establish a British protectorate over it, British trade relations with the Shaikhs of Kuwait have existed fop upwards of two centuries , and , inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade , His Majesty's Govern -ment could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration , or any infrigu© m Qut of the complete autonomy of the Shaikh, On the other hand , they are preparedto recognize Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait , and to recognize the Shaikh as a Turkish Kaimakam , j rovided in other respects the status tjuo is guaranteed , and the validity of certain agreements which the Shaikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; provided the islands of WartaWarba, and Bnbylan are admitted by Turkey be within the confineb nf Kuweit and Tnrl'ibh r^ilitarv j nuts are withdrawn; and provided finallythe stiaikh i8 admitted to the fnll and •ondistTirbed enjoyment of any rropertiee he may own hereafte purchase ''n Turkish territory# Knwait would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but en.ioying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty# Certain dif iculties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage ^f the Shatt-al-Arab # For a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominately , and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to naviagtion# For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned# In these circumstances , His Ma^estyis Government have some difficulty in appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements; but being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation , they would propose to the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission , composed of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon # This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation * and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys# As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf , on the other » hand , the Turkish GovernmeAt , so far as they are concerned, would recoginze the right of Great Britain (a) to control sur- -veying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements, (iii) The Increase from 11 per cent to 15 per cent ad valorem in the Turkish Customs ''Duties# His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous and satisfactory&amp; lb satisfactory settlement lias been roacliod in regard to the Bagh -dad Railway question* To this attitude they adhere; and while they consider that snch a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement snch as has already been indicated * they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as eithe r satisfac- -tory or complete , since it woxild leave^a state of nncertain- -ty a number of questions ilosely affecting Nritish interests in the regions of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf* His Majes^ -tyis Government are in priciple favourable to railway construe -tion in Turkey; but they cannot directly contribute to the com -pletion of the Baghdad Railway if it is to introduce a further element of possible disturbance into an area where British rigih and interests have, esiecially of late been wantonly assailed; nor do they feel they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will affect British trade — amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 per cent of the Tdiole -- unless they have provided for a general settlement of political i is ues in the Persian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themdelves desire to bring about , and unless they have obtain- i -ed some eompensation for aid a guarantee against the continu- -ance of arbitrary acts such as the demolition of , on no ade quate pretext, of British property in Bgfehdad. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotitation on these lines, and to concur , as already stipu -ulated , in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt-- His Maiestyts Government will make it their first aim to contribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between tho two Powers and they will not on- -ly consent subject to the concurrence of other Powers and to the due observance of such agreement , to the further increase of Turkish customs for a fixed period , but they will likewise agree to the continued lovyof the 3 per cent customs Increase which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914 Foreign Office 5&gt;9th July 1911. %(Cojy) Foreign Office to India Office* Immediate and Confidential* Foreign Office, August 16th, 19 XI* ypv ' # Sir, A request has been made by the Turkish Ambassador, under instructions from his Government, that he may be furnished with copies of the agreements with the Truoial Chiefs,and the sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, to which reference is mads In the meHS* randum communicated to His Excellency on the 29th ultimo* Ab the agreements with the Truoial Chiefs and the sheikh of Bahrein have already been published, sir Edward Grey assumes that there would be no objection to communicating them to the Ottoman G0V6rnment,and, If this is so, I am to request that your Department will be so good as to furnish, for this purpose copies of the documents In question in a convenient form.

Your telegram 17th August. ule have consulted Cox and he has personally inter viewed tlie Sheikh of Rowe it. ihe latter, in absence of more definite Rnowledge as to present negotiations, is opposed to details regarding agreement of 1907, i.e. foreshore lease be- ng disclosed; firstly because places in regard to which he has rejected overtures from other quarters are referred to by name; secondly, because agreement contains provisions which were framed as a safeguard against possible contingen cies which may never arise; thirdly, because publication of details would in any case cause inconvenient gossip among Sheikh's own subjects, and would also greatly increase hos tility of Turks to him should the Anglo-Turkish negotiations prove abortive. In my opinion, it would be very undesirable that the Porte should be furnished with any pai/t of the text of the Agreement, xhey are already aware qf* its existence, see Sir George Lowther' s despatch ho.3^6, of 26th M§.y 1909 to Foreign Office, and it would perhaps suffice to inform the Porte spontaneously that we have a lease of land at Roweit but see no necessity to discuss. The publication of the agreement of 1899 is welcomed by the Sheikh, always provided that we do not intend to diverge from it. On the same under standing, I think that the agreement might be communicated to the Porte, but I deprecate furnishing any part of Colonel Keade's letter of 23rd January 1899. It is obviously un desirable that the second para should be disclosed while the first paragraph only provides for 'good offices', whereas in December 1901 and October 1902, (vide Secretary of State's telegramtelegrams to Go/ernment of India, dated 4 th December 1901, and 14th October 190&lt;2) the Sheikh was informed that we would not tolerate an attack by Turkish ships or troops on ivoweit, and that we would protect Koweit and district against attack, tfould it not suffice to append a note to the copy of the agreement of 1899 that we had subsequently ini ormed the Sheiith that as long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agree ment, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against attack by sea or land ? *7 ^ I presume that you will furnish copy of Sheikh’s agreement to prohibit import or export of arms - (our Secret Despatch Mo. 86 , dated 5th July 1900), and his 'under- taxing not to allow the establishment of Post Office by any other Government than british - (see your telegram of 19th February 1904 and enclosure of our Secret Despatch No.152 External dated 27th October 1910). As regards Trucial Coast and Bahrein, we have no other treaties than those in Aitcliison, and this being a published worx, all or any might be communicated to Porte. The omission of Nos.32 and 46 might be misunderstood; but I see no other reason to object to their exclusion. «(Copy) /K I id ni © di a t#* , \ 50. P 1446/11. Si*.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Depart ment endorsement No. 2356-E.

In these circumstances, I would ask Government to consider whether it is not now advisable for us to apprise the Shaikh of the action we have taken. If the Government of India generally agree that it is expedient to make some intimation to him, and to do so now, then I would ask them to consider the precise form of the communication which I am to make. There would seem to be three courses open to us :—• (1) to inform the Shaikh that ‘ ‘ the terms of— (а) the agreement of 23rd January 1899 ; ^ 247 (б) the arms agreement of 24th May 1900 ; y ; (c) the postal agreement of the 24th February 1904, as per translations attached, have been communicated to the Porte who have been informed that His Majesty’s Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from him,” thus refraining from special mention of the omission to communicate a copy of Colonel Meade’s supple mentary letter of 23rd January 1899, or the substitution for it of the observations contained in the second paragraph of Sir Edward Grey’s communication to Tewfik Pasha, dated 24th October; (2) to include a quotation of these latter observations in our written communication; (3) to quote them verbally, simultaneously with the communication suggested in (1). 3. If the general negotiations with the Porte were likely soon to be brought to a conclusion, it might not be considered necessary to make any communication to Shaikh Mubarak at present, pending that development; but the danger is that he may conceivably learn details in the meanwhile from Turkish sources or be pressed for further information by the Basrah authorities, in which case he might presume that we had communicated to the Porte more than we had, and be led by want of precise details into making inconvenient disclosures. 4. I shall be taking an early opportunity to proceed to Kuwait to curry out the instructions of Government with regard to the presentation of the Shaikh’s recent decoration, and it would be convenient to me to know the views and wishes of Government in the connection under reference before leaving. I, therefore, solicit a telegraphic reply.LT^xs Dociuneat is the Property of His^Bntannic Majesty’s Government,.] &lt;Z. IATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [April 24.] ^ [ 16000 ] No. 1. Joint Minute by Sir A. Hirtzeland Mr.Parker on the Turkish Government’s Memorandum communicated on April 15, 1912. xi ^ ‘ 1. Bagdad Railway. (a.) Division of Share-capital in the Bagdad Bussorah Section. HFS Majesty’s Government originally proposed, in July 1910, that British mteiests should be represented hy 55 per cent, of the total share-capital. Turkey replied that she would prefer a distribution of 40 per cent, for herself, of 20 per cent, to Germany, 20 per cent, to France, and 20 per cent, to Itngland. To this, in July 1911, His Majesty’s Government made a countei-proposal that the distributioil should be 20 per cent, each to Turkey, France, Germany, Fngland, and Russia; the idea being to secure 60 per cent., or a majority, to the 3 Entente Powers : England, France, and Russia. ... .... , Turkey now professes to fall in with the British view, by distributing the capital equally between herself, France, Germany, and England, in the proportion of 25 per cent, each, the Chairmanship and casting vote being reserved to Turkey : No mention is made of Russia; but, in our informal discussions, the Turks intimated that they would not willingly admit Russia, and that, if His Majesty s Go\eminent persisted, they would have to introduce another country, say Switzerland, to counterbalance her. The effect of giving 25 per cent, to each of four Powers, and allotting to Turkey a casting vote, would be to place control in the hands of the Turco-German group, in so far as control does actually depend on the percentage of capital held. Control probably does depend upon the voting rights of the various sections of shareholders in so far as the appointment of a manager” and other high officials and similar matters are concerned. But though the control to be exercised by the Board of Dnectois will not be absolute (since it is proposed to fix by Convention the maximum ^ud minimum scales of tariff rates and many details regarding transport facilities), and it is therefoie possible to attach too great importance to the distribution of the share-capital as a means of control, we cannot recommend acceptance ^ of the Turkish proposal which we believe would be generally regarded as politically a defeat of His Majesty s Government, while financially the small amount of British capital that vould find employment would cause great disappointment. ^ i i i Sir H. Babington-Smith has expressed his belief that Turkey, on the analogy of her holding in the Bagdad Railway, which is only 10 per cent., would he satisfied with a share of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in the Bagdad—Bussorah section, and he appeals to have discussed the subject with the Turkish Ambassador in London. But ve are led to think that his impression is erroneous; since the Turkish aelegates represented to us that Turkev, as the territorial Power, was already r making a great concession in limiting her*shure to the same amount as that of the other Powers participating and Djdvad Bey has since forcibly expressed the same view in writing. . } Unless some via media can be found between the proposal of His Majesty s Government for five Powers, and the Turkish proposal for four Powers, a deadlock may If for political reasons, it is desired to retain Russian participation, His Majesty s Government might perhaps reply that they cannot agree to the distribution suggested bv Turkey (four Powers at 25 per cent, each) and that they therefore revert to the proposal made last July of 20 per cent, to each Power (Turkey, France, Germany England, and Russia), but that they would be willing to agree to the 1 resident ol the Company being a Turk. By this arrangement of a Turkish President, Turkey [2435 acr—1] We might stipulate that the Manager should be British. B-I n would be in a position nominally superior to the foreign countries, and this would make the agreement more acceptable to the Ottoman Parliament. But we anticipate great reluctance on the part of Turkey to any arrangement admitting Russian participation. We have already expressed the view that the control to be exercised by the Board will be unusually circumscribed; but, such as it is, it will, in so far as it is to serve British interests, be dependent upon the continued solidarity of the Entente Powers. The proposal made by His Majesty’s Government last July is based upon the assumption that, during the whole period of the concession—that is, for 99 years at least—the general policy of His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of France and Russia will be such as to insure concerted action on the railway Board, and it presupposes that the Governments concerned will be able to control the policy of their financiers, which in the case of France at least is more than doubtful. We venture to suggest that it may in future prove inconvenient that our interests should depend upon the co-operation of France and Russia on the Board, since the necessity of insuring concerted action by the three Powers in Mesopotamia may handicap British policy in other quarters. Moreover, it must be remembered that Russian commercial interests are here contrary to our own, since the value of this section to us—at all events for many years to come—lies in the fact that it will enable us more easily to pour our goods into Western and Northern Persia where at present Russia is our only rival. We are accordingly far from being persuaded that it is in the interests of this country to insist upon Russian participation in the Bagdad-Bussorah section ; and we venture to think that it would be better to provide for the Russian Government by participation in the Khanikin branch, to which, on terms, the German Government might assent, though the last-mentioned consideration applies to this course also. It must not be overlooked that Turkey is not altogether a free agent in regard to the distribution of capital, since the Bagdad Railway Company has reserved the right to a share equal to that obtained by any foreign country in the Bagdad- Bussorah sections. V (b.) Proposed international convention providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey; for the alignment of the railway south of P&gt;agdad, and the conditions under which it is to he constructed; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall he of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expii'y of the Bagdad Railway Company s concession. No specific mention is made in the Turkish reply of the “ international convention” which His Majesty’s Government desire, but we understood from the Turkish delegates that no objection would he raised to it. With regard to the exclusion of differential treatment, the Turkish Government declare themselves ready to assure to British commerce all facilities compatible with the agreements already concluded by Turkey with the Bagdad Railway Company. This limitation no doubt principally refers to the “ Cahier des Charges” or specification attached to the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, and there is some force in the contention of the Turkish Government that their hands are tied so far as concerns rates on the Bagdad Railway. The specification is composed of technical details, and it would be well to ask the Board of Trade and Government of India to cause an expert examination of the schedule of rates to be made, so as to ascertain whether they are of a nature to serve or to militate against British-Indian trade. At first sight the Turkish reply on this point, the exclusion of differential rates, seems satisfactory. Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that it is of great importance to provide that the facilities and rates on the Khanikin branch shall be the same for goods arriving from the Gulf as for those arriving from the Mediterranean. In this view we entirely agree. The Turkish Government are ready to meet His Majesty’s Government in regard to the alignment and the financial arrangements, subject to the arrangement ot details. On the other hand, they say that they are not prepared to agree to the arrangement to be arrived at for the Bagdad-Bussorah sections being of lasting duration, instead of subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. This is a point of some importance ; and we do not think His Majesty’sv' Government would be well advised to modify the attitude they have taken up on this question. In any case, if the principle of re-purchase by the Turkish Government is admitted, the exercise of such a right should be made subject to an undertaking that the present agreement in regard to the exclusion of differential treatment should not be departed from.* (c.) Pecuniary indemnity to be 'paid to the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of its renunciation of the right to construct the section of the railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. The Turkish Government say that this charge must be borne by the proposed new company for the railway south of Bagdad. It was always supposed that this would be so ; and we cannot well object. Indeed, Sir H. Babington-Smith has pointed out that this is really Turkey’s affair: Germany claims 2,0001. for each kilometre abandoned by her; and Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that Turkey would do well to offer bonds of the face value of 2,000L in place of cash, especially since the value of these bonds has fallen about 10 per cent, during the present war. (d.) River Dues. It seems equitable that Turkey should impose such dues for services rendered in dredging and such like operations in the Shatt-el-Arab; but we propose to discuss this point further in relation to the proposed riverain commission. (e.) Prolongation of the Railway from Bussorah to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government proposed, and Turkey agrees, that the best terminus for the moment would be Bussorah. But His Majesty’s Government further proposed that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and that a clause to this effect must be inserted now in a convention dealing with these matters. Turkey replies that there is no present cause for contemplating a continuation of the railway beyond Bussorah, but that, nevertheless, the Turkish Government are prepared to give to His Majesty’s Government all assurances necessary to disperse any anxieties wdiich may be felt concerning the continuation in question. His Majesty’s Government have every reason to insist upon a settlement of this question now, when they are negotiating for a general settlement, and possess the powerful lever of the customs increase. The Turkish delegates have represented that Turkey could not agree to the terminus of this Turkish line being under the control of either an Arab Sheikh or a foreign Power. The Turkish point of view is intelligible ; and it was partly owing to the difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution otherwise that His Majesty’s Government suggested that the railway should stop at Bussorah. We think therefore that His Majesty’s Government should maintain the view, in which the Turkish Government acquiesce, that the principal terminus should be at Bussorab, and that the prolongation to the Gulf should merely be regarded as a branch. But there is some danger that the Turkish Government might, if they could not secure arrangements satisfactory to them at Koweit, bring the Gulf branch to Um Kasr or elsewhere, and that the Sheikh of Koweit might deplore such a development. The Sheikh seemed gratified in 1907 when His Majesty’s Government concluded the lease of the foreshore, as he interpreted the transaction as a clear indication that the terminus of the Bagdad Bailw'ay would be at Koweit, and consequently that the commercial wealth of the port would be increased. But we would not attach too great weight to this consideration provided that the Sheikh’s position is secured. We accordingly think it important that the Turkish Government should be induced to bind themselves to bring the branch from Bussorah to the Gulf, if and when constructed, to Koweit under conditions to be settled at the time between Turkey and Great Britain; but that the position of Bussorah, as the real terminus. * I understood them to say that if the Bagdad Railway Concession were extended, the other should be extended also. Could we not compromise on that ?—A. II. I agree.—A. P. [2435 aa—1] B 2 iI / should be emphasised, and that the continuation to Koweit should be characterised as a branch line in the further negotiations with Turkey. (f.) Proposed construction and control of the port at Bussorah by the new railway company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. Turkey ignores, in her reply, the question of the construction and control of the terminal port at Bussorah. The Turkish delegates did, however, intimate to us verbally that Turkey would agree to the construction of the port at Bussorah by the new company. They did not mention control; and probably such measures as police control would have to remain, as at present, in Turkish hands. But it is desirable that control of the port should be entrusted to the proposed riverain commission. 2.—Political and Teuritorial Questions. (See map annexed.) (a.) El Katr. Here there is complete divergency between the Turkish and the British point of view. The Turkish Government have maintained a post at El Bidaa for 40 years ; and the Turkish Delegates have emphasised the difficulty there would be in reconciling parliamentary opinion to the abandonment of territory which Turkey has ne.v,§r f q y mslly renounced; and they represented that such a surrender would be particularly difficult to justify at a time when public opinion is smarting under the loss of Tripoli. They there fore urged that British interests might be reconciled with a consolidation of Turkish dominion in El Katr; but from this view the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India emphatically dissent. It appears to us that there is nothing in the Turkish agreement that would justify His Majesty’s Government in abandoning one iota of the claims advanced in the memo randum of July 1911, seeing that an important object, in embarking on a settlement of Gulf questions was to eliminate the Turks from the peninsula. We consider that His Majesty’s Government should protest energetically against the Turkish attempt to whittle away the assurances (see Annexe I) given by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and repeatedly given, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf; though Turkey did (in the person of Midhat Pasha) argue that there were no independent tribes in Nedjd. (b.) Bahrein. The Turkish reply on this point is, we think, fairly satisfactory. We understood from the Turkish delegates that Turkey is prepared to agree to Bahreinis having British Consular protection in Turkey, but not rights under the Capitulations, and this appears a reasonable attitude. (c). Zakhnuniyeh Island. According to the Turkish delegates this isle is connected at low tide with the mainland. It is however opposite a portion of the mainland which is south of Ojeir, the most southerly limit to which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised Turkish influence, and this attempt to establish themselves on the island seems to date only from 1909. (d.) Koweit. The Turkish reply evades a direct answer to much that was written in the British memorandum of July 1911. We consider that no useful purpose would be served by entering into a controversy as to past history, and that it would be expedient to reply to the Turkish Government that, while His Majesty’s Government cannot accept or admit the justice of the Turkish contentions, they would be glad to learn whether the Turkish Government are5 prepared to accept the settlement suggested by His Majesty’s Government last July, in the following paragraph :— British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-governmemt under Turkish suzerainty. As~regards the limits of Koweit it may be mentioned that in 1908 and again in 1910 the British agents toured over the whole of the country claimed by His Majesty’s Government without finding traces of any influence there except that of the Sheikh. But for the moment it is perhaps unnecessary to make any further reference to this subject, though unless the limits are eventually defined misunder standing is certain to arise. Meanwhile we consider that the Turkish Government should be informed that His Majesty’s Government could not agree to conclude an arrangement with Turkey if the military post is maintained at Bubiyan Island; and we consider that it would be impracticable to transfer our agreements with the Sheikh in the manner suggested in the Turkish reply. (e.) Riverain Commission for the Shatt-el-Arab. Instead of the joint Commission proposed by His Majesty’s Government, the Turkish Government suggest an Ottoman Commission, with a^ British engineer on it in the service of the Turkish Government, in order to avoid the appearance of internationalisation which it is their interest (and ours) to avoid. We understood from the delegates that the Commission would consist of two members only, and that the British representative would be in every respect equal to his Turkish colleague, and further that he would be free to correspond with the British Government as he pleased. Provided that his rights are secured by the Convention, and that it is also arranged that the two Governments shall agree as to the individual to be appointed, we think this may be accepted. But His Majesty’s Government’s further proposal that the executive engineer should be British should be insisted on. As soon as this Commission does any real work, the question of dues must come up, though so long as the expenditure is small, it may be possible to avoid it. But if the ownership of the Shatt is on other grounds adjudged to Turkey, the Turkish right to levy dues is undeniable, and if the dues are fixed by a Commission, constituted as proposed, its exercise seems harmless. The Turkish Government would undertake that there shall be no differential treatment of British shipping, and this should be embodied in the Convention. The Board of Trade might be asked to advise as to any other conditions that may be necessary. . The Turkish delegates were anxious that it should be understood that all pilotage in the Shatt-el-Arab would be controlled by the Commission, and this may be agreed to. (f.) Pilotage, &amp;c., in the Gulf. This is not mentioned in the Turkish reply, and His Majesty’s Government should repeat their claim to control it themselves. At the same time, it seems desirable to define the limits of territorial waters, on the basis of the Government of India’s telegram of the 18th April, and a chart, on which they are clearly shown might form an annex to the Convention. It would be agreed that any of the existing British buoys, &amp;c., or of those about to be laid down by us, which might be found to be in Turkish waters, would pass with the control of the Riverain Commission. (g.) Policing of the Gulf. Turkey desires to carry this out jointly with Great Britain. It is evident from this proposal, and from the proposal that they should consolidate themselves on El Katr,&gt; . a-s well as from the general attitude of the Turkish delegates, that what the Turks are aiming at is, under the proposed settlement, not only to secure what they already possess on sufferance, but also to obtain a footing which they have never had before. Now whatever may be said from the point of view of law, history, or policy, for the former aim, there is clearly no justification for the latter, and His Majesty’s Govern ment, whose whole object is to get the Turks, as far as possible, out ot the Gulf, can clearly, in no. circumstances, acquiesce in it. We submit that this should be made quite plain, and it might be well to remind the Turks of Lord Lansdowne’s statement in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf, by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” The next step would seem to act as suggested under (d) on p. 4.

[July 18.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 , [28322] No. 1. L—i Ci ___ Sir Edward Grey to Tewfik Pasha. (ConfidentiaL) Your Highness, Foreign Office, Jidy 18, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply of His Majesty’s Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard to the Bagdad Railway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohainmerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Riverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. ^ These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. s \ \ 1. HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine \Gth /nuch care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative [2546 6—1] B2 and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that ^ no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— Draft Con vention (Annex 2). Draft Con vention (Annex S). (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (b.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier Mohammerah. (/.) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government wfill appreciate the important sacrifice made by3 Q esty’s Govern- y proposals and iration may be region of the s to traverse a bal exports and 7 ’s Government the manner in two and a-half recalled that Bussorah was tlement of the ) an increase in iers it desirable liern section of ivernment find, 3 m is likely to views held on l these circum- rovernment the thout delay or cipation in the at on the other :h a step unless :ish interests of t consequently n the following ention, for the His Majesty’s ;■ &gt;nstruction or of the Persian on conditions ; draft, for the in conjunction the frontier stween Bagdad eg ion of the sh Government no difficulty in f the Imperial s they do not rifice made by A ‘ 1 His Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty’s Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty’s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pashas expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no lurkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4 . Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the lurkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula of El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. # , 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Memo , Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the lurkish military randum post from Bubiyan, nnd to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance vith (Annex 4^ the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go farther. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to^British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; [b.) 'To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arra 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, 'Tew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the developmentMemo randum «] (A nnex 5). S' &gt; of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Of ice, July 18, 1912. ANNEX 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

ANNEX 3. Draft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission. THE Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows :— 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all ^ °2. The Imperial Ottoman Government wall establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. The Commission shall consist of t\vo members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty. [2540 s —1] ^* 4. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £ T. 2,000 free of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid by the Commission. 5. The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties :— (a.) The execution of such works us may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (6.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (r.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. (c.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/.) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 11. Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be advanced by the high contracting parties at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 12. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 13. The Commission shall* publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. 14. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its ordinary expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 15. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of repute, to be agreed upon by the commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 16. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities.17. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, buildings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the discharge of their duties by the officers of the police, pilotage, or other services maintained by the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 18. The transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect the territorial jurisdiction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction, nor shall anything in this Convention be deemed to give the Commission power to exercise jurisdiction or to carry out duties or to hold land outside the limits of the Ottoman Empire without the consent of the territorial Power, or to affect the operation or the interpretation of the provisions of any treaty or arrangement prescribing or defining the limits of the said Empire. 19. This agreement shall be binding during twenty-one years from the day of its signature. In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years, of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. ANNEX 4. Kowek. HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na’airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Itadaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. Districts and Islands .—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Riqa’i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, l^ra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. ^The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and ’Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Koweit. ANNEX 5. Mohammerah Frontier. HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now' have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [2546 s —1] Dconference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, w r ho carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point J5f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beui Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “ Hawizeh district ” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ’’ for Turkey to claim it aseat store of Sir Henry) found study al facts and information, n traced in t trade with n regard to H*ab during been locally be followed, s the Shatt- ia. aib will be n Hawizeh : its living in a triangle ly occupied nomadic, in e triangular i, which has n for, at any ierly passed the Persian ie agency of ituated, and is not the zeh district, is Majesty’s of the Beni inhabitants .

Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid ; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark ; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquai of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption, that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “ thalweg ” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession ” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh.10 (ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. (iii.) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory. of 191^. Britiah HesidQnoy and Consulate-danoral.

The Government of India called to mind, with re ference to Warba that by our agreement of 190? we had secured right of pre-emption over entire island and its foreshore and that this would be regarded by Sheikh as an admission that Warba belonged to him. In their Note to the Porte of July 29 th resulting C? ^ / from above exchange of views. His Majesty’s Government stipulated for recognition of Warba and Bubyan, as Ko- % — . . 1 -o} r weit territoryand Turkish posts\withdrawqt frhat the status&lt; status quo in other respects should be guaranteed, and validity of certain of our agreements with Sheikh recognised. This drew from the Turks a request to see our agreements with the Sheikh. ^ The Government of India pj^oposed to append a note to the agreement of 1899 to the effect that we had subsequently informed the Sheikh that as long as he and his heirs etc. acted up to their obligations 14 under his agreement we charged ourselves to support t hem and to protect Koweit against atteck by land o r sea/.' This was intended to Cover our assurance of 1901 and 1902 to Sheikh that we would protect Koweit and districts against attack by Turkish troops or •' ships. The wording of the appended note was modified by His Majesty’s Government to ' support them and ac- cord them their good offices;H is Majesty’s Government reserve right to interpret that term at their discre tion' . ^ ^ On 30th October 1911, Secretary of State for India stated 'In view of the fact that it has since been de cided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory as described in Horimer’s Gazetteer' This was communicated to the Porte. In January 19ip, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs told our Ambassador that the withdrawal of the Turkish military post at Bubyan would be a difficulty• On April 15th the Turks gave His Majesty’s Go vernment their reply which as regards Koweit was as fSl follows:- 'As regards Koweit limits, as represented and claimed by His Majesty’s Government and forming a territory 160 miles broad and 190 miles long, these limits are all the less admissible seeing that the sphere of influence of th e Sheikh does not extend beyond■beyond 'Kiazimeh, Jahra and Sira w . Above all, the Sheikh’s influence does not make itsel. felt beyond SO Kilometres, i # e. to the limits of the territory occupied by the great AJman tribe”. His Majesty’s Government replied on loth May as follows xxx They are somewhat doubtful x xx p■ j) t ; ' enumerated above. In May 1912 in replying^the above note the terri torial question was still reserved for the time being but it was proposed to point out that in 1908 and 1910 British Agents toured over the whole of the country claimed by His Majesty’s Government without finding traces of any influence there except that of the Sheikh; it was considered unnecessary at that juncture to make any further references to the subject though unless the limits were eventually defined mis understanding was certain to arise. ^ r r ^ On 1 st July, India Office wired'asking whether it would be practicable to recognise autonomy of Koweit town, harbour and immediate surrounding, whilst as regards the wider limits, present status quo was to be maintained and Turks given to understand clearly that Sheikh was en4 titled to our good offices in the event of unprovoked aggression within these limits.

No .690 Firstly . It does not appear to me that the concession proposed would be one ' in appearance only '. Bubyan and Warba having been claimed specifically in our Memorandum to the part of the sphere covered by guarantee their eliminination from its scope in the settlement arrived at will be tantamount to resigning them to Turkey unless there is placed on record a much stronger safeguard than the mere 'title to our good offices in the event of unprovoked attack'. With no better deterrent than that, the localities in question would be a Constant field for intrigue on the part of local Turkish authorities and a source of an xiety both to ourselves and the Sheikh who would certainly think that he had been treated with bad faith. No adeauate safeguard can be suggested by me less than categorical recorded stipulation that while the town, harbour and immediate sur roundings should be completely autonomous the remainder of Ko- weit territory to the extent attributed t^ it in Lorimer f s Gazetteer (vide letter dated 9th May 1911 from Foreign Office to India Office) should be specifically recognised as being under the Administrative influence of the Sheikh of Koweit and that Porte should agree neither to place military posts nor take any other action within it without the previous t 1 oint consent both of the Sheikh and of ourselves. x X X X9,000-3-10 DRAFT—(For Approval).

From Hafar the boundary line assigned to the T 'o- weit district alike by Mr.Lorimer and Cantain 'h^kesrear is the Batin, a b^-oad low depression in the desert, in See Mr.Lorimer’s Gazetteer Vol.II p.28ll which water can generally be found at no great depth, and which contains excellent grazing. Beyond it stretches desert, almost un inhabited and suite unfertile. The ^atin is a well known and well marked boundary and a tract of great value to Bedau'.ns.

Probably in reality his claim has as much validity as those of the Turks who previous to 1901 had never shown any interest in the place. But His Majesty^ Government have decided 10 years ago that they would not support hio claim to this outpost and I presume that they will not alter that decision now in any case* fortunately the place loses much of its strategical value if Warba and Bubyan are re tained by the aheikh.

Fjpon??— Captain W. H. I. Shak«8j; ear, I«A. , P olitical A^ent, Kuwait • To:— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, In reply to y^ur letter No 1642 , dated the 3ist July 1912, I have the honour to submit herewith in the form of a Note, a report upon the boundaries of the Kuwait principal* -ity , with such evidence as is available , and which I have been able to criticize from persoB&amp;l observation. It must be remembered , however, that regarding; jurisdiction over wild nomad tribes documentary evidence does not exist. 2 I would at3 2. I would at once observe that having been over most of the ground myself, having questioned Bedouin and other Arabs of almost every tribe, which wanders within 300 to 400 miles of Kuwait, it is not possible for me to agree with Mr. Lorimer in the limits he lays down in Volume II of his Gazetteer. In the attached Note I have tried to give, wherever possible, evidence recorded in our own papers and reports or gleaned first-hand from Arabs other than Shaikh Mubarakh ; Mr. Lorimer’s information, on the other hand, was derived almost exclusively from the Shaikh himself, at a time when our knowledge of the hinterland was far inferior to that available now, 3. It will be noticed that in the attached Note I have not mentioned Jabal Manifah nor Nairiyah Hill—the reason for the omission being that the line I indicate includes both these points as well within the Shaikh’s territory With regard to the Summan—this tract by common consent among the Bedouin is regarded as within the “ dira ” (or district) of the Umtair tribe and so should come within Mubarakh’s territory, that tribe being subordinate to him. My suggested boundary line, however passes along its northern limits My reason for so placing the line is that the really important points are the wells, and none exist in the Summan tract; a tribe occupying Anta’a, Wabrah, A 1 Haba and A 1 Gara’a wells is practically unassailable from the south except during the spring and after rain, when pools may be found. f 4. The line indicated in my note is as definite and definable as any which one can expect to find in a desert, but it must be borne in mind that where wells are mentioned, those wells are included as within the line, for ownership of the wells is the paramount consideration. It is for this reason that Mr. Lorimer’s supposition (vide Gazetteer, Volume II, page 1060) a “line running...so as to pass immediately south of Umm Kasr and Safvvan to Jabal Sanam ... is untenable ; such a line throws these wells outside Kuwait territory and conse quently has the effect of virtually placing the boundary at the next nearest water, which is as far south as Jahra. 5. From the prdcis attached to your letter under reply it would appear that the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government have arrived at certain conclusions with regard to the Turkish posts on the Kuwait boundaries. Nothing in my office archives shows that any final conclusion has been reached with regard to any particular point, and l mention this fact for I am convinced that nothing has ever been communicated to the Shaikh to lead him to suppose that we regard any of his claims as doubtful or that we contemplated acquiescing in any way in the continuance of any one of the Turkish posts. The news will therefore come to him as a considerable surprise and I venture to invite serious consideration to the probable effect on the Shaikh’s mind of discovering for the first time that we are prepared to condone in the smallest degree Turkish a gg ress i° ns 0 n his borders. The result, in my opinion, would be most deleterious to the particularly cordial relations which now subsist between the Shaikh and overselves and perhaps lead to an infinity of petty trouble in the future. I would venture to recall the fact that for an oriental chief Mubarakh has been exceptionlly straightforward in his dealings with us and that the risk of estranging him does not appear to be warranted unless we have some very substantial quid pro quo to offer him, which is at present beyond my ken. In his reliance upon the British Government he has repeatedly rejected the most seductive of Turkish overtures and we are now in the position, it seems, of discussing his boundaries, his power, his position with the Turkish Government without giving him, one of the parties most concerned, much voice in the matter or indeed information as to the course of the discussion. 6. It is for this reason that I have submitted a somewhat exhaustive note from such records as were accessible to me and ventmre to urge with all defer ence that in the main the Shaikh’s statement of the position is far more worthy of credence than that asserted by the Turkish Government. P,S .—Since the above was drafted I have been able to obtain the state ments of some Safwan cultivators, which I attach as speaking for themselves.4 Note on the Boundaries of the Kuwait Principality. In surveying the disputed boundaries of the Kuwait shaikhdom it will be convenient to commence from a definite point, proceed by west and south to east and return northwards to the first point, thus completing the circumscribing line. For starting point we will take Umm Kasr as being the most definite point and one on which some reliable evidence is available. Umm Kasr lies near the head of the Khor Zobair {vide Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Volume II naee i w). The earliest reference to the place is to be found in Colonel Lewis Pelley’s report of his journey to Riadh (Bushire Residency letter No. 57, dated the 15th May 1866), where in paragraph 18 he records that “Originally the Shaikhs of Kuwait occupied a fort called Mongassar on the Zobair creek a little to the northward ” I may note here that I have at various times and from at least a dozen of the Kuwait greybeards personally venfied this statement to be an accepted fact. The place only came into prominence m the earlv part of 1902 owing to the arbitrary location by the Turkish Government of a detachment in the mud-walled enclosure called the thl ^ L act £ seems [° have been retaliatory to the British support accorded t0 Mu ^ arakh a ,, s before. On the 15th February 1902 the spot was visited by H. M. b. bpninx , shortly after the arrival of the Turkish detachment, and it will be seen Commander Kemp’s report dated the 20th February 1902, to the Senior Naval Officer that at that time the place was certainly regarded as within Kuwait terri tory and it was only the presence of the British Naval Officer and his personal intervention which prevented an attack by Kuwait Arabs on the Turkish post. Since that date the post has been maintained but with diminished numbers (the present figure being 8 or 10 men). Though Mr. Consul Wratislaw in 1902 considered the Kuwait Shaikh’s claims to Umm Kasr “very shadowy , it is not apparent that he relied upon any stronger evidence that t he actual existence at the time of a Turkish post and upon the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait made no immediate effort to eject the soldiers. Mr. Wratislaw, however, also comments that “the Turks seem to have little claim beyond that of actual occupation an occupation which we know to have been initiated only a few months earlier. The probable and natural explanation (and the one always given by the Shaikh himself) for his supine attitude in this matter, is that his valuable date-gardens on the Shatt-al-Arab w’ere hostages to fortune and he was not^ prepared to risk reprisals on his main source of income in order to uphold his title to a barren and comparatively worthless spot. Had the Shaikh not been influenced by a fear that any direct action against the post might deprive him of British sympathy, he would and certainly could have wiped out every Turkish post in his borders with the greatest of ease at any time within the last ten^ years. The next recorded opinion I find as to the ownership of Umm Kasr is in my predecessor’s letter No. 136, dated the 4th January 1905, written after a tour past the Fort with Mr. Lorimer’s Gazetteer party, and in this he includes Umm Kasr within the Shaikh’s domain. The Shaikh’s own view of his claim is given sufficiently fully in my letter No, G.- 53 , dated the 3rd July 1912, and expresses what he has always maintained verbally ; in this connection a reference to Bushire Residency letter No. T-io, dated the 1 ith June 1905, is also invited. My own opinion formed on numerous independent enquiries during the last three years from many different persons, Bedouins and others, certainly supports the Shaikh’s claim. There is no question of his reviving a claim to the Fort; the Shaikh’s objection is to the existence of a Turkish post, for the continued presence of foreign soldiers at a group of desert w’ells naturally connotes the jurisdiction of their Government over them. In point of fact, I believe, the present fort was built by the Turkish troops when the original mud-walled enclosure crumbled away. The strongest evidence in the Shaikh’s favour lies in the following facts :— {a) That until the occupation of the posts at Umm Kasr and Safwan, it occurred to no one that Turkish jurisdiction went so far. {b) That to the present day disputes between the Bedouin at these wells are referred to Kuwait as a matter of course.y 79 (c) That persons looted by Arabs at these wells always resort to Kuwait for redress. (d) All Arabs using these wells consider the Shaikh of Kuwait as the responsible ruler of the immediately surrounding tract. When the relatively short distances of these wells from Zobair and Basra is compared with those from Kuwait, it will be conceded, I think, that without some very good ground or reason resort would not be had to the Kuwait Shaikh for redress. In the face of long existing traditions and facts of the above descrip tion, which moreover are supported by the reports of our own officials since 1866, it appears impossible to me to ignore the justice of the Shaikh’s claim and he will certainly be bitterly disappointed if his plaint is dismissed as not proved on the objection that a Turkish post has existed (and that on sufferance) at the spot for the past ten years. Safwan .—The above remarks apply with almost equal force to the case of Safwan, but here, though the name does not appear so frequently in our own officials ’ reports, we have some cultivation and it may be possible to produce the evidence of the actual cultivators. Mr. Lorimer (Gazetteer Volume II, page 1642) appears to take for granted that the village and cultivation have always been wuthin Turkish boundaries, a view which I have not found to be shared by either desert or town Arabs. I was in the vicinity in March 1910 and again in January 1911, when l passed the wells. Cultivation appeared to have ceased and I am told by the Shaikh that this has come about through the exactions and oppression of the soldiers quartered in the Turkish fort. The Shaikh agreed readily to send to me for cross-examination any of the original cultivators if they should happen to be in Kuwait and I hope to be able to forward their depositions later. Most of the cultivators used (to go?) to Nejada, who had been settled at Safwan from many years before As in the case of Umm Kasr his jurisdiction over the wells is rendered void before the world by the presence of the Turkish detachment, and it is to this presence, continued for ten years, that the Shaikh takes objection. Jabal Sanam lies a little to the south and west from Safwan {vide Lori- mers Gazetteer, Vofiirne II, page t 64^ and Is^atmed by the Shaikh as within his northern boundary, running on westwards to the Ar-Ratk ridge where the latter impinges on the northern end of the Batin depression. The line from Umm Kasr to the Batin as described above is a natural one favoured by the terrain ; wells on or near a boundary are always apples of discord with Arab tribes, for whilst used freely by two contiguous tribes when at peace they would certainly be claimed by both if any question of ownership arose, and the very fact of such contention will often establish wffiere a particular tribe’s boundary may be said actually to lie. In the present case the Dhafir and Munta- fick tribes both occasionally claim Safw r an wells and describe them as their south ern boundary conterminous with Mubarak’s. But as it is the As Subah writ which runs in their immediate vicinity, the balance of evidence favours their in clusion within Mubarakh’s territory. Al Batin is a very plainly marked natural feature running north-east and south west from the As-Ratk ridge to Al Hafar {vide Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Volume II, page 281) and has always been pointed out to my predecessor and myself as the As-Subah boundary. It is habitually used for grazing by the camels of Kuwaii merchants during the spring and at other times, and depreda tions committed therein and eastwards always become Mubarakh’s concern in obtaining redress or allocating punishment ; west of the Batin is regarded as Shammar and Dhafir territorry. One of the main caravan routes into the interior from Kuwait strikes into the Batin at Rigai wells and the road thence lies in the bottom of the depression. Al Hafar .—As far as these wells caravans from the east and north are always considered to be under the Kuwait Shaikh’s protection. As a further instance of evidence of the kind mentioned above, it is interesting to note that when Mubarakh is on good terms with the Shammar tribe this tribe uses the Hafar r6 wells in the summer, and if asked as to their boundaries I have no doubt would claim them for Bin Rashid : previous to 1897 when Mahomed-bm Rashid s power was paramount such claim would have been correct but since that power waned the wells have been recognised as marking the western point of Kuwait jurisdic tion. As-Safah .—Leaving Al Hafar by the Falaij Janubiah in a south-easterly direction the Kuwait boundary would follow a track to the As-bafah wells, where another of the main caravan routes from Kuwait comes in, and up to this point again caravans using that route consider themselves under Kuwait protecaon. In a former report (my letter No. 133, dated the 23rd March |.9.0) I des cribed the southern boundry as being a line joining As-Satah with Anta a village. At a later date (March 1911) l was able to traverse the country east and south of As-Safah and found that this boundary, as claimed by the Shaikh ^e more accurately described as running from As-Safah for some 25 miles b. b. li. to Al Gara’a wells and thence due east to Wabrah wells and thence east by south to Anta’a. This line passes across the heads of the numerous valleys running north and south through the Samman tract and is a more or less natural line. Al Gara'a .—Starting from As-Safah in a south-south-east direction the Al Gara’a wells will be reached after some 25 miles and he on an alternative route from Kuwait for the interior. Leaving Al Gara’s and heading almost due east the boundary would follow a fairly nutural line across the head of the Summan valleys to Wabrah wells. A reference is invited to Lorimer's Gazetteer, Vol. II, page 1919 in this connection. An alternative line which I am inclined to regard as more correct since it accords better with the lie of ground is from As-Safah wells south-east by east direct to Wabrah wells and thence to Anta’a. Anta'a vilhge.—Yrom Wabrah travelling east by south would take the boundary line through some rough country still on the north side and edge of the Summan tract to Anta’a village. This village looks to Kuwait lor its employment and the imported necessaries of life, the people regard themselves as Kuwait subjects and their Shaikhs frequently visit Kuwait to pay their respects to Shaikh Mubarakh, on whom their authority and position depend in considerable measure. A very full account of this village, its customs e ^ c -j given in my predecessor’s report forwarded with Kuwait letter No. 138, dated the 25th March 1908. Turkish suspicions were aroused by Major Knox’s tour and he replied to an enquiry on the subject in Kuwait letter No. 257, dated the 23rd Mav 1908 ; both these letters have a bearing on the boundary and jurisdic tion question. I also visited this village in March 1911 and found that the people still considered themselves as the subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait. As a proof of the extent of Shaikh Mubarakh’s influence I would add that I camped one day’s march south of Anta’a with his nephews who were then spending the spring in the Abu Dhahir hills and valleys with the Kuwait standing army. Jazirat-al-Amayir .— Vide Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Volume IT, pages 940 and 1283. This name is that commonly used by Arabs to describe the Islands of jinna and Musalamiya shown on the charts. The islands lie nearly due east of Anta’a and in a sheltered bay which is resorted to by all the Kuwait pearling boats. In fact this bay may be considered the head-quarters of the Kuwait pearling fleet during the diving season. It is not resorted to by Bahrain and other dtvers, and though Bahrain and Darin are the actual markets -for -p«acL dealers the Kuwait boats use Jinna and Musalamiya as their main provisioning base. There are wells with huts on both islands and the spot is in frequent touch with Anta’a, which is some two days’ march distant. The inhabitants are fishermen in winter and collect firewood from the mainland for sale to the pearl- boats during the diving season; during this season they also become pearl-divers-. The pearling community have always regarded these islands as within Mubarakh’s jurisdiction until the arrival of the Turkish posts in 1902, of which I would observe in passing only one now remains, consisting of three men on Jinna island.7 A^/ As an influential Arab remarked to me, “ The islands (are ?) to Mubarakh but the Turks have taken one and put soldiers therein The small islands of Qaru, Umm-al*Maradim, Kubbar, are all claimed by the Shaikh as lying off his territory. All however are barren and consist only of a rock knoll covered with sand: they are all uninhabited, contain no water and are not visited by boats. Falaikha Island—\s inhabited {vide Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Volume II, pages ^12-^1^) and unquestionably belongs to Kuwait, the present governor being Shaikh Mubarakh’s own brother, Jabir-bin Subah. Similarly the two outliers, Mas- chan and Uha islets, which are merely sandy knolls and uninhabited, belong to Falaikha and consequently to Kuwait. Bubiyan and Warba Islands.—{V\de Lorimer s Gazetteer, \ olume II, pages ^24. and 1927). Both these islands are claimed by the Shaikh as part of his Kuwait territory from ancient times and that they are so regarded by local people is obvious from the report forwarded by my predecessor under Kuwait No. 295, dated the 9th June 1908. The evidence therein is as strong as it is possible to obtain from a wild, illiterate people such as the Arabs occupying the fishing grounds on these islands. The point remaining then for decision was whether Warba Island formed part of the mainland or of Bubiyan Island. There is no doubt that Mubarakh himself is convinced that Warba really does form part of Kuwait territory, and as we have recognized it as such by including a pre-emption clause relating to it in our Bundar Shwaikh Agreement, we should be in a very difficult position vis-a-vis Mubarakh were we now to throw doubt on his title. From Warba Island the Kuwait boundary may be taken to run along the Khor to Umm Kasr, but it must be remembered that the Shaikh also claims Jazirat-as-Suf (Wtf Residency letter No. T-io, dated the nth June &lt; , 9 ° 5 )' which is ground lying opposite to Umm Kasr across the Khor on the mainland. 1 understand Jazirat-as-Suf to lie between two small creeks and to become an island only at high tides. General .— Having traversed the disputed boundaries, it will be convenient to treat~'the area enclosed as a whole. I may mention here that 1 have personally seen the whole of the land boundary 'described with the exception of some five miles in the vicinity of Umm Kasr and the actual line between Wabrah wells and Jazirat-al-Amayir, though I have visited Anta’a itself and toured through the surrounding country. /''All Arab Shaikhs base the territorial extent of their power upon their ability to maintain or enforce some order over the adjacent tribes, their power to enforce the payment of “ zikat” by Bedouin and their capacity to prevent and to avenge outrages and raids within the territorial limits claimed. 4 Judged by these stand ards there can be no question that Mubarakh is the paramount chief within the limits described. He levies “ zikat ” from the Awazim, who are practically a Kuwait tribe, the whole of the Umtair excepting two or three distant sections is Nejd, most of the Ajman, the Bani Khalid and until lately also from the Dhafir. It may be contended that though paramount as an Arab Chief his position may still be within Turkish suzerainty. If any such right ever existed (which is denied in toto), I would urge that there is no evidence of its ever having been exercised or recognised within the limits described or acknowledged by the tribes noted above. The comparatively recent occupation of a few points by petty Turkish detachments is regarded universally among the Arabs as an encroachment, the posts have only existed on sufferance and the men garrison ing them cannot, after 10 years of occupation, venture beyond sight of their walls. If it be held that so ineffective an occupation, continually protested against bv the Shaikh it may be added, can give the Turkish Government any rights over-riding those exercised by local independent chiefs for many genera tions, and if we should acquiesce in the Turkish assertion of their so-called sovereign rights over Kuwait so far as to reduce materially the Kuwait boun daries indicated above, I confess I regard with profound misgiving the effect likely to be produced upon our own relations with Shaikh Mubarakh when t e matter has to be explained to him. As he has often said, he regards the Bntis/ Government as his protector and rightly or wrongly, ^^^become^ convinced that it was unnecessary for irn J British Government posts for their eventual removal was a po acquiesce would insist at its own time T the idea that we 7 ^ in their continuance has 1 feel sure never crossed his mind.

On this occasion the Shaikh ot every section of the Ajman tribe came to Kuwait and 1 personally happened to be present when it was decided by Mubarakh in a conference that Fahad and Thaidan al Hithlain should succeed Mahomed.

In point of fact the Turks have no first-hand knowledge of the interior nor of the tribes over whom they claim authority. Kuwait ; Dated the gth August 1912. W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain^ Political Agent, Kuwait, Statement of Othman bin Mahomed al Ateybi, aged about 55 years, at present residing in Kuwait. States: Over two years ago I left Safwan where my family had been settled from my forefathers’ time. We left the place because when the soldiers came they began to oppress us and worry us with demands for the few things ^ g r ew W e came originally from Nejd and I am really from the Ateyba tribe, f-do not+rmw when mv forefathers came to Safwan, but it was very long ago -, i was actually born in Kuwait but worked at the gardens in Safwan from when 1 was quite a email boy. There were about 15 huts in the place all belonging to our Nej people. We cultivated grain, wheat and barley and vegetables. We had no regular payments to make to any one but it was upon us to look after Shai Mubarakh’s cattle, sheep, camels etc., when they were m our vicinity and we had to draw the water and maintain the wells in order for him. Two years ago there9 L / / / was a man of ours killed by a shot from the Turkish fort and we then left the place. We always regarded the place as part of Mubarakh’s “ dira ” and our selves as his servants. We left Safwan some 2 or 3 years ago, as the result of a man of our*s being killed by a shot from the Turkish Fort. The soldiers said one of us had at the right seasons. The date palms belong to the Nakib of Busreh, but we used to look after them. I believe after waiting for a year fcr us to come back he has put other men of his own into the place to look after the palms. Our occupation was to raise wheat, barley, and vegetables, and look after the Shaikh’s people when they were in the vicinity as they often used to be in those days before the Turks came. We did all the watering of the animals and such like work. Until the soldiers came, nobody worried us and all matters were referred to Kuwait for settlement. When we left the place no one went there for a long time, and as far as I know, there is nothing done in the agricultural way there now. I have been in Safwan since I was a boy, but have been now for the last two years or more living in Kuwait. We left Safwan because the soldiers contin ually oppressed us and finally killed one of our men. The incident came about thus: A Turkish soldier came from the fort and wanted to enter one of our huts— my uncle’s son’s hut—and he of course told him to go away and tried to prevent the soldier entering; there were words and then the soldier shot him. His name was Mahomed, and he was a boy of only 15 years. We complained to Shaikh Mubarakh as he was our Shaikh and he said we had better leave the place altogether, and this we then did ; all of us came and settled for good in Kuwait where most of us also had homes before. We were in a way servants to Shaikh Mubarakh at Safwan ; passed on strangers and messengers, and provided lodging, food and water for his men and looked after his cattle. Our occupation ordinarily was the raising of wheat, barley, vegetables and such like for our needs, whilst we also looked after the date trees of the Nakib of Busreh. When we left the place there was no one left there except the soldiers. Kuwait ; Dated the 12th August IQI2. Read over and acknowledged as correct. W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, Political Agent.

Secondly, as the Turkish Government were aware, cer tain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Kr- zeroum, and the geographical position of nohammerah was such that Sheikh would of necessity be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission, ills Bajesty*s Government, therefore, propose that the Commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the Commission such representations as nay De necessary upon any question affect ing those rights, and intimated that they would use their good offices with the Sneikh and the Persian Government to induce them to agree to this arrangement. The following is a summary of the draft honorandum, which id of considerable length;- Baghdad Railway question . The magnitude of British interests in Mesopotamia is such tnat it is plainly very desirable that some understand ing should be come to with regard to British participation in the Baghdad-nulf Bection; since, however, it appears that theviews of tne two contracting parties on this point are lively to be difficult to reconcile, and in order to prove the sincerity of their desire to reach an understanding with the Porte without delay or controversy, His Majesty*s Govern ment are prepared to withdraw their request for British parti cipationJPu i oipation in tne railway frorj iia^hdad to Budreh, if a satis factory agreement is arrived at on otnar points. This offer is subject to the follo./in^ stipulations:- 1. An arrangement to be concluded providing for exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. The admission of two British representatives, approved by His najesty'o Government, on the board of whatever company may undortane the construction or working of the Ba^hdad- Busroh line. 3. The terminus of the line to be at Busreh. 4. Bo railway to be constructed beyond Busreh to the Per sian Gulf without prior agreement with and with the concur rence of his majesty*s Government. 5. A donvention to be signed for the future conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab, to be read in conjunction with a Memoran dum regarding Mohammerah which is reproduced in extenso be- 1 OW , (Vide AmxtxT ). 6. Permission to be granted for three British steamers to navigate between Baghdad and Busreh in addition to the num ber already allowed.

As regards ^owoit. His i:ajesty*s Government are con cerned to ensure the continuance of local Government oi the Sheikh of xvoweit, as defined in their Memorandum of 20th July 1911.

His majesty* s Ciovorninent hJ-va already informed tha Imperial Ottoman uovornment of the ^reat importanoe which they at tach to tne maintenance of the Frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of I.ohammorah. uio majesty’s aovornment no»/ have the honour to ox- plain their vie.vs in greater detail, ai.d they v/ould preface their statement by observing that they have rot only re examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, ./hich .vas laid before the conference of urzeroum, but they have also had rapKXtx recourse to the great store of information collected by the tfell ano.m savant ^ajor (afterwards Sir Henry) Hawlinson, v/iio was v/ell acquainted .vith tJie country and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land, moreover much information, which was not at the disposal of the Com missioners at urzeroum, has bean traced in the voluminous records of the Hast India Company, who carried on direct trade with Juscorah from the year 1635. These records are specially illuminating in regard to the conditions which ac tually prevailed on the waters of the Chatt-al-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier aa it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from tne neighbourhood of Hawizeh tc Ju point where it strikes the Shatt-al-Arab and secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. Hy reference to the accompanying map Ho.l, x hj village of bhu*aib will be observed at a point 15* miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh; it is a settled vi 11 agevillage of the Beni Salih, containing aorae 500 inhabitants living in permanent dvrellings. The .vhole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, find ivuskh-i-Baari, is regularly occupied and cul tivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are n ot nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, vho exclusively inhibit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of ^huxistan or Arabiatan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay re venue to their tribal Sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the 'Baula' ruler of Hawizeh, who injturn paid it to the Persian Government, but since li^OS, this tribute has been collected tlirough the agency of the Sheikh of hohammerah. To the eastward of the : arsh C-' whicn tno village of Snu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occu pation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of xurKish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British resident in the Persian ^ulf has recently visited the -awizeh district, uid his investigations have served to confirm the information wnich his majesty’s dovex^n- inent already possessed. Apart from the Sheikhs and tribes men of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Sox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status tjuo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows:- 1. That wnatever is the western boundary of the IIawizeh is &gt; ipso facto * the xrontier qP Persia; in other words, 't-xiat the Hawizeh district is included within the outlines of Persia. B. That the 'Hawizeh district' comprises those lands which arc regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes ba-longing to it, and paying revenue to Pjrsiu. 3. That, on the above proud sea, tho boundary locally recognised is that shown by green line on z ap no. 1.. It will be noticed that the line (which it forued by the edge of the narah, and ia time a natural frontier) after crocsing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cute the main channel of the marsh just west of ohu*aib, cortinuee in a southerly direction until it roaches a point due west of nushkh-i-Basri, whence it breaks back to that pl-ice, and then proceeds diorct to the dhatt-al-Arab at Di’aiji. Tho reason why nushk-i-uasri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at lafair; tho limits of cultivation and. occupation by tribesmen under Ha- wizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at whicn tney can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to bo reached at Ahush-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great a 0 o form a convenient landmark. his majesty's Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Ha- »vizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authori ties but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Dasha, whose estimates of xurkish claims were not usually marked by ex cessive moderation, admits in Chapter Anl of his book (print od in Constantinople in 1BC8) M that it would be hardly right” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, His Excellency expresses tno view that it” night be useful” for Turkey to claim it as pretext for proposing something else, viz: that the aerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Conir:^ now to tho neighbourhood of the Shatt-al-^rab, the frontier as locally observed enters the hhaiyin Canal (which is tho name of the cuannel running from the Turkish Customs Dost at Dibaiji, between tne islands of Hharnubiyah, is ow aria,botfarin and Aqu^at, to tko junction of tho f :ihr liazaileh 4 with the main stream) at a point between the wahr Di’aiji and tne inohr nbul Arabid; it follo.vs the middle of the Kaiir nhai^in until it reacJios the point • die re the hahr nhaiyin and the ihihr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the fhatt-al- Arab (see map ho.d). It then proceeds, as shown 'oj the broken black line (see accompanying maps hos.3 and 4) alon^, the rair channel of the Shatt-ul-Arab, in nid-stream, until that river roaches fche Persian uulf. The claim made by fcfcx Persia rests on continued and un disturbed possession for over a century, and on the recogni tion of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turksi Government in many ways and on many different occasjons. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribes men that the boundary as locally observed lias not been questioned by the xurkiah authorities who, on tne contrary, many years ago had actually hurried done coal in a pit as a permanent boundary nark and it further appears that the pe riodical cleaning of the ifdir iihaiyin has axa always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of nohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di f aiji Oanal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish Mudirs. The local inhabitants .moreover, dy&amp;x draw a vary clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of nohuiumorah in, for instance, the isl nds of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamsharaiyali knd Umr-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of vdiich ho is merely proprietor, and 2 is position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point vnere the locally ob erved frontier leaves the idiaiyin Oanal and, opposite the hahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-al-Arab it follows the medium filum aquae of the bhatt-al-Arab down to the Persian dulf. (See maps imos. 3 and 4). This line of denarkation is in accordance with the ge neralV neral pr-Jijuinption vshero a navigabla rivar forma the jy boundary of contarminoua btatas, the riddle of the channel or 11 thalweg' ia the actual lino of aeparation betv/oen those to statea. buch a presumption may, uo^ever, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy anu lon^ axat undisturbed posi tion on the part oi one of the two status, or by express treaty stipulation^. The records of tne past 300 years, as contained in the l icial arcnives Ox the at.ot 1'iJ.ia Ooispaiiy arid, oi’ His ha— jesty*s Government, are far fro: supporting any claim on the part of xurhey to 'prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession' of the Shatt-al-Arab; while no express stipula tion is contained in the Treaty of Arzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the stiver. if, therefore, his Majesty’s Government had strict re gard either bo purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf, but they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement xxtk which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between them selves, but also between the bubline Porte and the Sheikh of mohuramerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing.

I enclose some extracts from an earlier report of Knox’s whic show the strength of the Sheikh’c claims. It should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based not on the Sheikh’s unsupported statements, but on tho evi dence collected during the last five years by our own offi cers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. As regards the Turkish request for a right of ’.my for their troops Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia either by way of the Bedjas or from the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf (where they already have garrisons). He would therefore be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded it should be guarded by a firm proviso that no posts or garrisons are to bo established along the line of march or elsewhere. You will have noticed that the Government of India askjrf thal if the compromise is adopted they may feojiH have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the Sheikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources.

HIS Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, animated by the sincere desire to settle by mutual agreement certain questions concerning their interests, have determined to conclude agreements destined to prevent all cause of misunderstanding between Great Britain and Turkey in regard to the questions referred to, and have nominated for this purpose their respective plenipotentiaries, to wit: Who, having communicated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following:— Agreement concerning Koweit. The Governments of Great Britain and Turkey being desirous of placing beyond all doubt the status and limits of Koweit and the adjacent territory^ as respectively defined in articles 5 and 7 of this agreement, and the relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and Turkey, and taking into consideration the special interests of Great Britain in Kow r eit, and the long-established relations between Great Britain and the Sheikhs of Koweit; Have agreed upon the following articles :— 1 . Great Britain and Turkey recognise Koweit, as defined in article 4 of this agreement, as an autonomous sheikhdom under the suzerainty of Turkey. 2. Great Britain and Turkey recognise the Sheikh of Koweit as a Turkish kaimakam. 3. Great Britain and Turkey recognise the right of the Sheikh of Koweit to exercise complete autonomy within the limits laid down in article 4 of this agreement. Turkey undertakes to abstain from any infringement of such autonomy, and from any interference with the succession, internal administration, or foreign relations of Koweit. 4. Nothing in this agreement shall be taken to prevent Turkey from appointing an agent at Koweit. 5. For the purposes of articles 1 and agreed to be a segment of a circle drawn with the centre of Koweit town as its centre and a radius extending from that point to the mid-channel of the Khor Abdulla at its northernmost point between the island of Warba and the mainland, to include Krain in the south, and to a point at a corresponding distance from the centre of Koweit in the west. Within these limits are also understood to be included the islands of Bubiyan, Mashian, Failakah, Anhah, Kubbar, Karu, and Umm-al-Maradim, and the islets adjacent thereto. 6 . Great Britain and Turkey recognise as subordinate to the Sheikh of Koweit the tribes within the territory defined in article 7 of this agreement. The Sheikh of Koweit shall continue to levy tithes from such tribes as at present, and shall conduct such administration as may be necessary in his capacity as Turkish kaimakam. Within the territory defined in article 7 of this agreement Turkey undertakes not to set up any administration apart from that of the Sheikh of Koweit, and not, without previous arrangement with Great Britain, to station any garrisons nor take any military or other action. 7. The limits of the territory referred to in article 6 of this agreement are agreed to be as follows : a line running north-west from the coast at the mouth of the Khor-es-Zuhair up to and past but not including the walls of the fort at, Sawan A . i . • Si of this agreement the limits of Koweit are3 2 to Jebel San am and the Ar Ratq ridge; thence south-west along the Batin to and including the wells of Haiku ; * thence south-east, including the wells of A1 Safah and A1 Garaa, Wabra and Anta’a; thence north-east to the sea near Jebel Manifah.- And the sheikh shall continue to levy tithes from such tribes as ah present, and shall conduct such administration as may be necessary in his capacity ol lurkish kaimakam. 8 . Turkey recognises the validity of, and undertakes to respect, all the agreements which have been concluded between the Sheikh of Koweit and Great Britain, copies of which are set out in the schedule to this agreement. 9 . Turkey undertakes that the Sheikh of Koweit shall be admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any private properties on Turkish territory which he may now own or may hereafter acquire in accordance with lurkish law. 10 . f Nothing in this agreement shall detract from any right which Turkey may at present p of marching trodps by the recognised caravan routes across the limits definec rticle 7 in the direction of Nejd, provided, hVwever, that Turkish posts or garr shall not be maintained or established therein, except by previous agreement wi eat Britain. * 0?’, south-east between the districts of Summan and Dahanah to the route from Wabra to Riadh; thence north-east to the Na’airiyeh hill at the north-west corner of Radaif; and thence to the sea near Jebel Manifah.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence regarding the Anglo-Turkish negotiations relating to the status of Kuwait* ending with the Government of India telegram in the Foreign Department, No. 63 S., dated the loth April 1913. 2 . You are aware that I returned to headquarters on the 21st April to find Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah dangerously ill. He is now recovering slowly, but I have not found it possible up to date to say more on the subject than to state that his letter and enclosure to your address had been forwarded to Government, that as the conclusion of the war 'was in sight it was hoped negotiations would soon be actively taken, up, and that you have asked Govern ment to keep you informed as to their course; also that I did not considerparagraphs appearing in the Basrah papers could give reliable information of matters which were the subject of confidential negotiations between the British and Turkish Governments and on which we had not yet received a pronounce ment from Government. 3. On one occasion, when I visited the Shaikh before I had received copies of Foreign Office print No. 12978 , dated the 26th March, your telegram No. 637 of the 3rd April, and Foreign Department telegram referred to above, the Shaikh mentioned that he received news from Basrah to the effect that the British and Turkish Governments had agreed upon Kuwait autonomy and that he was perfectly satisfied for all his claims had bee i recognized. The Shaikh’s condition then being serious, I said no more than that I doubted the authenticity of his information or that the Porte could have receded so completely from a position which sometime ago I knew showed a wide divergence from his claims. A lew days later 1 obtained a copy of the “ Dastur ” (published in Basrah) which contained a paragraph in its issue of the 12 th Jamadi-al-Awal 1331 (16th April 1913) practically identical with what the Shaikh had told me. I attach, for information, a rough translation of the paragraph, which, I may add, was also received with as much satisfaction hy the Kuwait public as the Shaikh. It will be obvious, however, that this satisfaction is based on a vastly different conception of Kuwait autonomy to that disclosed in the draft agreement of the Foreign O fice print 12978 of 26th March. I shall, however, take the first opportunity made possible by the Shaikh’s improvement in health to prepare him for the fact that he must expect a considerable alteration in his present view of the position. 4 . Meanwhile, I venture to submit, for consideration, the following points, trusting that even now it may not be too late to obtain better terms for the Shaikh As a result of my*recent tour I have been able to lay down with some accuracy the position of wells and other features to the south-west of Kuwait by which the Shaikh’s southern boundary is determined. The Shaikh claims to include the Al-Gara’a and Al-Haba wells, and all the information I have been able to collect points to the fact that his claim is justly founded. I have attached herewith the confidential “ Map of the Kuwait Hinterland ” with the doubtful portion in the south corrected from my latest tours, and would invite a comparison with the same map uncorrected in your office as likely to be useful. By far the strongest argument in support of the Shaikh’s claim, however, is the actual situation of the wells themselves. Taking the Al-Haba wells as a centre and striking a semi-circle of 90 miles radius from east round by south to west discloses the fact that in the whole of the intervening country there is not a single well and that the nearest wells to the southward lie on this semi-circle, viz .,—those of Awaina, on the east situate 27 miles south of Anta’a, next those of Hafar-al-Ats, almost due south from Al-Haba, and those of Gaiyiya (at 105 miles), south-west of Al-Haba. It may be taken for granted that nomad Arabs recognise authority in the desert according to wells, and never in all my tours have I heard it suggested that the wells of Hafar, As*Safa, Al-Gara’a, and Al-Haba (all along the Shaikh’s southern boundary) were not in Kuwait territory and jurisdiction. How I came to omit the Al-Haba wells from my previous report, No. 62 C., dated the 12th August 1912, I cannot now understand. I have marked in blue pencil what is undoubtedly the actual boundary on the attached corrected map. As I have traversed personally the whole of this district, obtained my information from Bedouin camping actually on the spot, and myself produced what map there is of the tract, I claim that my opinion is entitled at least to as much weight as the assertions of the Turkish Government, which has no real or first-hand knowledge of the area, facts or conditions as they actually exist. 5 . While I am fully aware that an agreement with Turkey regarding Kuwait can he reachea only by compromise, I venture to submit with all deference that it is worth while in our own interests to consider how any compromise is likely to be regarded by the Kuler of Kuwait and his people and its probable effect on our relations. It must be recollected that the Shaikh has not been informed of the course of the negotiations, nor of the Turkish5 y demands, nor of our suggestions or concessions thereto—he has left hi&amp; case in our hands with the expectation that we will at least see his just demands satisfied. Consequently we shall have to bear the odium and any resentment resulting from such disappointment as may follow from the agreement falling short of the Shaikh’s expectations. I have shown in previous reports and above what can fairly be considered Kuwait boundaries, and now propose to state what I feel convinced would be the really genuine objections the Shaikh would advance to the draft agreement on Foreign Office print No. 12978, dated 26th March, if it were communicated to him. 6 . Taking the draft agreement by articles seriatim — (a) Article 1 may be passed by as without objection. {b) In Article 2 the objection is that the title of Kaimakam is a very inferior one and counotes that Kuwait territory is merely a “Qadha”. An almost exact parallel w T ould he furnished by calling the Shaikh a Deputy Com missioner or Collector under the Indian Government and his territory a “district”. When it is added that a Turkish Kaimakam’s annual salary amounts to £1M5 to £270 only, and the position indicated thereby is contrasted with the fact that the Shaikh has hitherto enjoyed almost complete indepen dence, been accorded a salute of 12 guns by British rren-of-war and always been addressed officially as “ Ruler of Kuwait”, the depreciation of his position under the draft agreement may be realized in some measure^. Further, though Turkish officials address him as Kaimakam and add the title of Pasha, the Shaikh himself does not acknowledge the style and invariably describes himself as “Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its tribes”. I venture to think that we should stipulate for Kuwait to be described at least as a “Sanjak” and its ruler as a “ Mutasserif ”, of which the Indian equivalents would be a Division and a Commissioner. The question of the continuance of a salute to the Shaikh would also seem to be involved in our recognition of whatever Turkish title or rank may be selected. (c) Article 3 defines complete autonomy sufficiently clearly. (d) Article 4 permits the appointment of a Turkish Agent, and has the most serious objections. The Shaikh has not dreamt of such a possibility, and, I am sure, would object most strongly to the idea. He could doubtless be compelled to receive one, but the pressure would have to be applied through, with the consent of, or perhaps even directly by, the British Government. The effect on our relations with and our interests in Kuwait of forcing the representative of an undesired Power upon an unwilling Ruler and people may be easily imagined. There is further to be reckoned w ith the inevitable and recurrent intrigues which will result from the residence of a Turkish official in Kuwait. My own opinion is that the Turkish Agent, if permitted, will either be regarded as a spy by the ruling Shaikh of the time or be utilized by him in intrigues and efforts to play off the Turkish and British Govern ments against each other for his own ends*. (e) Articles 5, 6 , 7 require to be considered together with the map. In the first place, the division of his territory into two portions, over which be and the Turkisli Government will have authority difierent in degree and kind, will be unintelligible to the Sheikh and will moreover lead to constant friction, for the inner segment defined in Article 5 has no naturally definable boundary and is a paper arrangement which the Shaikh will be unable to maintain in the exercise of his authority throughout the w r hole of the two portions over which at present it is identical in character. Secondly, the suggested difference will furnish the Bedouin tribes subject to the Shaikh and the Turkish authorities with endless opportunities for petty intrigue and friction, particularly if permission for a Turkish Agent as suggested in Article 4 is accorded. Assum ing the best intentions on the part of the Turkish Government and its officials, intrigue remains as the breath ot life to Bedouin, and the suggested division of his territory will undoubtedly hamper the Ruler of Kuwait in his dealings with the tribes. I would suggest that the Shaikh’s complete autonomy as defined in Article 3 should extend to the limits described in Article 7, modified so far as may be considered possible by the information I have given above in para graph 4. The alternative southern boundary given in a starred foot-note toArticle 7 is useless from the Shaikh’s point of view for reasons already given in paragraph 4 above, and moreover is not desired by him. In tins connection it would seem desirable that the evacuation of the Turkish posts on Bubian Island and Um Kasr should be ensured either by the present agreement, or, it preferred, separately if that at Safwan is allowed to rein in. It will l^^lear from reports ever since the occupation of these posts in 1902 that the Shaikh would have taken measures to eject the Turks hut for being restrained by British assurances that we had not lost sight of the matter. Ihe stipulations in Article 6 prohibiting Turkey from stationing garrisons or taking military or naval action within Kuwait boundaries should be maintained. (f) Article 8 requires no comment. (r/) Article 9 requires no comment beyond that I believe the Shaikh bns already succeeded in obtaining legal recognition for bis landed properties in that permission is said to have been granted for their registration in^ his own name without the formality of taking out a Turkish “ nafas tazkireb . (li) Article 10 would, I am certain, be most strongly opposed by^ the Shaikh for the reasons given in Residency telegram No. 602, dated the 28th March 1913. If some such clause is strongly pressed for, it might be worded su as to permit the passage of Turkish troops to Nejd by no route nearer to Kuwait than the caravan road passing along the western boundary from Basrah, by the Batin depression to Hafar w r ells. 7. Though the foregoing may he said to he largely destructive criticism of the draft agreement, I have endeavoured to show how that agreement may be made somewhat less unpalatable to the Shaikh. Unpalatable it will be and will remain for years even with the emendations I have suggested, but it seems to me that in treating with the Turkish Government we have hardly given the Shaikh’s irrefutable rights the consideration due to them, for his claim has throughout been founded on a just minimum of existing facts which we have been at some pains to investigate ourselves, whilst in^ our desire to meet the Rorte we have shown a benevolent sympathy to their vague, extravagant and nebulous claims, unsupported es they are by any real evidence, which they do not merit. That we may obtain a quid pro quo elsewhere does not affect Kuwait for the Sheikh wull judge the agreement as it touches himself and his people and inasmuch as lie has left his whole case unreservedly in our hands he will he the more inclined to resent any serious diminution of Ins territory, prestige, rights or privileges. The whole force of such resent ment will certainly recoil upon us, more especially were the idea to obtain that we had benefited in some other sphere, and it is because I feel so strongly that the advent of any bitterness in our very cordial relations vviih the Ruler of Kuwait should he avoided as far as may he possible that I have ventured to submit the above paragraphs for consideration. Shaikh Mubarak has been tar more loyal and straigRtforward in his dealings with us than we could have anticipated from an oriental chief of so little education, and therefore merits the most benevolent consideration of his claims at our hands, more particulary when we are negotiating regarding them practically without consulting him, the party most interested.

(Extract) copied by the Turkish paper “ Sabah” from the “ Jeune Turc ”, the organ of the Union (and Progress Committee)—that the Turkish and British Government are prepared to conclude an agreement between them selves upon the placing of Kuwait, which is in the Persian Gulf alone autonomous). And the English (Government) by their quality as an Islamic Power are addressing the Turkish Government on the safeguarding of their legal interests, but this proposal will not affect at all the status quo between them and other powers in Eastern questions. In exchange for this GreatBritain will be reassured in her moderate penetration (i.e., objects) in the Persian Gulf upon the results of the agreement as to the autonomy of Kuwait, and the “ Jeune Turc ” says that if the question of Kuwait is settled in this manner there will be good results to British communities and also it will be profitable to the Turkish Government.V No. ni&gt;i of 1913.

Please refer my telegram No. 79 of the 10th instant regarding the Baghdad Railway. The discussion of Baghdad Railway matter seems to be the subject of Hakki Pasha’s mission, for the Porte’s recent reply to the Powers’ collective note is connected with that question through the 4 % customs increase. That reply may thus perhaps become the basis for resuming negotiations for the preliminaries of peace. I gather that the instructions that have been given to Hakki Pasha are that he should be accommodating in regard to the desiderata that your note of the^/ 18th July 1912 sets out. Please see the last paragraph of my telegram of the 10th instant, No. 80. The signature of preliminaries direct with the allies is what the present committee apparently seems very anxious to avoid.

By Lord Crewe’s instructions, I enclose a statement of a possible basis of com promise as regards Kuwait. His Lordship hopes that it will not be used except in case of real necessity, since the Shaikh will certainly regard it with suspicion, and will (Cox anticipates) already be greatly disappointed by the loss of Um Kasr' Safwan and Musallamiya, to say nothing of Anta’a. As to this last, Lord Crewe suggests—without pressing it—that if opportunity offers for obtaining a rectifica tion of the southern limit so as to include Anta’a (as shown in red on the map*) it should be taken. I enclose some extracts from an earlier report of Knox’s]* which show the strength of the Shaikh’s claims. It should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based not on the Shaikh’s unsupported statements, but on the evidence collected during the last five years by our own officers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. As regards the Turkish request for a right of way for their troops, Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia, either by way of the Hedjaz or from 27 * Not sent. f Also extract from letter from Major Knox, dated 23rd May 1808; extract from letter from Captain Rhakespear, dated 23rd March 1910, and extract irom Captain Shakespear’s Diary, dated 25th February 1910.the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf (where they already have garrisons). He would, therefore, be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded, it should be guarded by a firm proviso that no posts or garrisons are to be established along the line of march or elsewhere. You will have noticed that the Government of India ask that if the compro mise is adopted they may have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the Shaikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources. Lord Crewe attaches importance to this. Statement. I , 1 . The limits of Kuwait and of the tribes subordinate to the Shaikh are as defined in annex 4 to the British Note of 18th July 1912. That is to say 2 . From the coast at the mouth of the Khor es Zubair the line proceeds in a N.-W. direction up to and past the walls of the fort at Safwan to Jebel Sanam and the Ar Ratq ridge. From the latter point it runs in a S.-W. direction along the Batin to, and including, the wells of Hafar, whence it turns to the S.-E. between the districts of Summan and Dahanah till it reaches the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. From that point it runs N.-E. to the Na’airiyah hill at the N.-W. corner of Radaif, and thence to the coast at Jebel Manifah. 3. The islands included in the limits of Kuwait are those mentioned in the annex above referred to. 4. W ithin the limits specified, a circle shall be drawn with Kuwait town as its centre and a radius of approximately 60 English miles, including Warba Island and the mid-channel of the Khor Abdullah to the north, Qrain hill to the south, and Kubbar Island to the south-east . Within the territory thus circumscribed the complete autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait shall be guaranteed, as defined in the British note of 29th July 191L ^ 5. Outside this circle and within the wdder limits described in paragraph 1 , the existing status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the Shaikh shall continue to levy tithes and there shall be no direct Turkish administration and no Turkish garri sons ; and further the Turkish Government shall agree to take no action, military or other, within those limits without previous arrangement with us. 6 . Provided that there shall be a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Kuwait limits in the direction of Nejd, without, however, the right of establishing posts and garrisons as above- mentioned. #* G.

Clause 3 . His Lordship attaches great importance to the ref erence to foreign relations, and trusts that, though it may be difficult for the Turkish Government to accept it, it will be insisted on. Clause 5 . He would prefer to say” articles 1 to 4”, thus limiting the Turkish Agent to the narrower area, and lessen ing the opportunities for intrigue. His Lordship thinks that it might also be desirable to add to the list of islands what is shown on the map as Maqta island, although, accord ing to the Gazetteer, no channel exists between it and the mainland.

The natural line of approach for Turkish troops to Nejd does not lie across the area covered by the agreement; and in spite of the safeguards that have been inserted this concession may be a source of much diffi culty hereafter.

P. From Rooidont Bushir©. To Foreign Simla, No. 943. Dated 27th llay 1913. Up to th© 24th May no intimation of the details of the draft oomvention regarding Koweit had J&gt;oon mad© to Shaikh Mubarak, owing, to hio serious state of health, as before reported. Reuters telegrams of 17th May however contained a forecast of the contents and as these telegrams are ordinarily sent to Koweit, I instructed Political Agent to make ofverbo.1 communication to the Shaikh, as if a message from me, inform ing him of what were th© probable terms of the Convention as far as crould understand. I asked him when doing so to make the Shaikh see that his general position had been assured satisfactorily but that, as is necessary in the rase of all of amicable adjustments ad: issues, it load probably been necess ary to for Kis Majesty’s Government to display a give and stake attitude in respect of some of the points of detail. I have now received a telegram from the Political Arent report ing that as a whole his communication was fairly well re ceived by the Shaikh, but that latter 'expressed in the strongest and most vehement manner his absolute refusal aver to permit the presence of a Turkish Agent'. Later on after further deliberation Shaikh Mubarak walked over to the Agency in a perturbed state of mind to reiterate his refusal and to ask Political Agent to telegraph his views to higher au thority. He pointed out that ho had faithfully observed his engagements with us, and that the specific object of them was to protect him against such a possibility, as that at pre- sent contemplated. Political Agent continues that signs are not wanting to show that Shaikh is disposed to think that he has been sac rificed for some quid pro quo and that his attitude will not be altered by anything but the strongest coofcion. Hei Ho io not to be oatiBfied with the explanation given in For eign Department telegram of 13th July to the Secretary of State. To begin with the appointment of a Turkish Agent is clearly a modification of the status quo. Secondly the Shaikh is him self Turkish representative in his capacity of Turkish Kaim- . akam as urged in my telegram No. 090 dated Jt*ly 1912. If that \ cannot be maintained then the difficulty could perhaps be surmounted by the Shaikh specifically entrusting supervision of Turkish cases and interests to one of his sons 311001434 - MUr. ft ^ ^ 1 ^ I venture to think that the present anxious situation at Katif and Busreh affords us a moot convenient opening for warning lurks that in view of present outlook it would seem \ most Important to get negotiations completed as soon as possible in terms satisfactory to all parties and conversely that it would be most unwise to ho still se Shaikh Ilubarak Just now.

A further safeguard, mentioned by our Constantinople Correspondent on Thursday, is that Great Britain is to be represented by two directors on the board of the Baghdad Railway, which is apparently to resume its right of constructing this section. Various French reports have spoken of special arrangements with regard to the pro jected Baghdad-Ivhanikin branch, which is to connect the railway with the future Persian system. They may safely be disregarded. I Any special arrangement of this kind would i be out of harmony with the spirit of the agree ment. The general provisions for ensuring equality of treatment for British goods will, of course, apply to this important trade artery, together with the rest of the Baghdad system. In regarding the progress of the Baghdad Railway with a more friendly eye Great Britain will be following the example of Russia. It will be remembered that, by the Potsdam Agreement of August, 1911, the Russian Govemment, in return for stipulations safeguarding Russian interests, agreed not to place any difficulties in the way of the scheme. The French Government, whose interests lie in other parts of the Otto man Empire, have been kept informed of the trend of the negotiations. As French capital is strongly engaged in the Baghdad Railway, any agreement facilitating its progress can only be welcome in France, Germany is, of course, more closely concerned than any other Power, and the definite com pletion of the arrangement with Turkey wall probably be followed by negotiations between London and Berlin. There appears to have already been some conversation on the subject, and it is clear that an agreement on the lines indicated ought not to be difficult. Closely connected with the question of the Baghdad Railway is that of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates, with regard to which Great Britain possesses certain rights and privileges. It is unlikely that the negotiations will come to an end without an agreement _boing reached defining and m aintaining those , rights which are essential as giving British trade an independent right of access to the markets of Mesopotamia. If Basra is to bo the terminus of the Baghdad Railway, the settlement of the long-standing difficulties concerning the navigation of the bhatt-el-Arab becomes an urgent necessity. Duties in those waters—dredging, buoying, lighting, sounding, policing, &amp;c.—which have been neglected by Turkey have been performed by Great Britain. This has given rise to con siderable friction from time to time ; and it is clear that any comprehensive arrangement about the Persian Gulf and the Baghdad Railway must provide for the settlement of this question with the others. The obvious solution would be to establish an Ottoman Commission, with strong British participation, to exercise independently all the functions of a navigation and port authority in the waters and mr-tbe shores of this waterway. White the personnel of this authority should be as largely as possible of Ottoman nationality, it can only be effective if the heads of both the inspection and the engineer branches are British. We shall be surprised if the agreement does not . include a Convention setting up such an autho rity and defining its functions. This is the more likely, as the Jvarun River, m which Great 5 Britain is interested, flows into the hhatt-el-Arab above the bar. Moreover, tiie left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab belongs i territorially to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who also owns private property on the right, or JLurkish, bank. Very close relations exist between Great Britain and the Sheikh, whose de facto interests in the waterway must therefore be a matter of concern to the British Govern ment. These interests of the Sheikh are affected by the long-standing dispute over the Turco- l ersian frontier, and have been the principal obstacle to a satisfactory settlement of the southern portion of that frontier. The reports are obviously correct which include this frontier question among those to be settled by the present negotiations. A settlement equitable to both Turkey and Persia will be a mattei of the greatest satisfaction to Russia and Great Britain, who have made many joint attempts at mediation during the past 70 years. Our Constantinople Correspondent, in his telegram of Thursday, spoke of the abandon ment of the Turkish right of control over Egyptian borrowing as one of the conditions of the settlement. No one who knows the importance attached to this question by the British and Egyptian Governments can doubt that he is correctly informed. The agreement when completed and con firmed will be an event of the utmost importance for the development of Asiatic Turkey and the promotion of British trade interests in the Middle East. It must, however, not be for gotten that at present it is still in negotiation. [A telegram from our Berlin Correspondent reporting German comment on the negotiations will be found on page 7.] Imperial and Foreign Intelligence. PERSIAN GULF QUESTION. THE PROTECTION OF GERMAN INTERESTS. (from our own correspondent.) BERLIN, May Ifi. The orth-German Gazette, publishes the following Communique to-night:—- I he negotiations begun two years ago between England and Turkey about the questions of the I ersian Gulf have, during the past weeks, been brought near to their conclusion. The German interests affected hereby arise in the main out of the German participation in the Baghdad Railway. ! In March, 1911, upon the occasion of the conclusion of the financial agreements about the continuation of the Railway to Baghdad, and upon the occasion of the grant of the concession for the branch line to Alexandretta, and for the harbour of Alexandretta, the German group, which holds the leading position in the Baghdad Railway undertaking, opened the road for a Turco-British agreement, in so far as the interests and rights of the Baghdad Railway Com pany come into consideration. It did so in correct appreciation of the fact that an agreement between England and Turkey about the long-disputed quest ions of the Persian Gulf and in connexion therewith an agreement between Germany and England regarding the economic questions connected with the Baghdad Railway will remove a serious obstacle to the com pletion of this work of civilb-ation and will in a high degree promote the great economic purposes which alone have from the German side from the beginning l&gt;oen pursuo-d in this undertaking. The German group then declared its agreement in principle with the whole or partial transference to a new Turkish company, capitalized internationally, of those rights conceded to the Baghdad Railway Company, which refer to the territory south of Baghdad. The condi tions for this transference and the settlement of all details were expressly reserved as matter for future agreements between the Tur kish govern ment and the Baghdad Railway Company. In so far as the agreement between England and Tiykoy that has been attempt ed upon the basis of t his declaration affects t he interests and rights of the Baghdad Railway, the agreement can be completed only with the consent, of the Baghdad Railway Company and—in view of the great, importance of this economic undertaking—only with the agreement of the German Government. The German Government and the interested Com pany are kept nu rouravt of the Anglo-Turkish negotiations. The course of these negotiations thus lax justifies the assumpt ion that from the German side also the result can be accepted as a satisfactory solution. Before, however, the interested German parties and the German Government can give their consent a further exchange of views will be requisite, by means of which the German interests may be pro tected indisputably, ami equivalent compensation (gleichicertige Gegenlc-istungen) for any German con cessions (Zug esUindn is sc) may be secured. About the present state of the matter more cannot bo said without, disturbance of the negotiations and evidently has not been said by the non-German parties to the negotiations. The announcements which thus far have found their way into the Press are partly incomplete and partly inaccurate, and are therefore not calculated to form the foundation for a criticism of the agreements. Whatever the purpose of this communique, may be the form of it does not. seem well calcu lated to check Press discussion, or to promote the settlement that all parties ostensibly desire. Roughly speaking, it has hitherto been under stood that Germany, or the Baghdad Railway Company—which are identified in this coni munique —had already secured ample com pensations for any concessions ” in the shap&lt; of the new Alexandretta concessions. Tin heavy hand of the semi-official writer nov traces the prospect, of further bargainings wit-l the requirement of further “ equivalent com pensations.” The publication of tho com munique at this moment seems curious, because except in the journals which are supposed to b« inspired by the Deutsche Bank, there has beei no public outcry here and most people wil heartily welcome an immediate settlement. %* *^ n article and a map dealing with th Persian Gulf question will be found on page 8 .No. 1828 , dated Cushire, the 7th (received 16 th) June 1913 (Confidential). From—L tkutenant-Colonkl Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to my telegram No. 948, dated 27th May 1913, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the marginally-cited letter which has 'No 13 c., dated the 2 sth M«y 1913 . since been received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, with regard to the attitude of Shaikh Sir Mubarak-bin-Subah towards the Articles of the Anglo-Turkish Convention concerning Kuwait. No. 13 C., dated Kuwait, the 28th May 1913 (Confidential). \\&gt; __ _ From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to correspondence regarding the Anglo-Turkish negotiations anent the status of Kuwait, ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 1602, dated the 20 th May 1913, and in accordance with your instructions, I have conveyed verbally to Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah a general idea of the trend of the Agreement about to be concluded between the British and Turkish Governments. 2. I visited the Shaikh on the day following the receipt of your instruc tions and was careful to dwell upon the efforts which His Majesty’s Govern ment had made to secure above all things the autonomy of Kuwait, an acknowledgment of our special relations with its Rnler, the recognition as far as possible of the boundaries claimed by the Shaikh and his more practical interests such as a definite pronouncement regarding his authority over adjacent islands and the nearer Bedouin tribes, the prohibition of any interference by the Porte in Kuwait’s domestic or foreign questions, the exclusion of Turkish troops from Kuwait territory and the admission of the Shaikh’s right to the undisturbed enjoyment of his properties on the Shatt-el-Arab. However, as no negotiations could be conducted without a certain amount of give and take, it had been found necessary apparently, in order to obtain these solid advan tages, to give way on some points of detail to avoid wounding Turkish susceptibilities and it was therefore probable that the Turkish posts at Safwan and Umr Kasr would continue, whilst the recognition of Turkish suzerainty would be likely to entail a demand by the Porte for the residence of a Turkish representative in Kuwait. The Shaikh heard me patiently enough, occasion ally interjecting a shrewd question as to exactly what might be involved by an acceptance of Turkish suzerainty. In reply, I gave the analogy of Egypt, where the Khedive, though nominally a Turkish Viceroy and a subject of the Sultan, enjoyed British protection and was for all practical purposes quite independent* of the Porte, who had no word in his internal administration, the collection of revenue, and the like. 3 . The Shaikh rather resented the continuance of the posts at Safwan and TJmr Kasr, but when I explained that we were endeavouring to secure the recognition of his boundary as touching these places and that the permanent location of half-a-dozen Turkish soldiers in a mud fort at these points really made no practical difference, he seemed inclined to agree. His attitude, however, was quite different when I intimated that recognition of Turkish suzerainty might entail the reception of a Turkish Agent in Kuwait, as such was actually the case in Egypt. The Shaikh was so surprised at the possibility that he asked me to repeat and explain the matter to him more than once, and when I had done so, he became most vehement in his opposition to the idea. He begged me to telegraph at once intimating his refusal to accept any Turkish official under any guise whatever in Kuwait. He used all the arguments which I had anticipated in my letter No. 8 C. of the 30th April 1913, and finally said that the presence of one such official, for he knewi 2 from bitter experience what Turkish officials were, woulrl destroy whatever good the proposed Agreement might hold, would weaken bis •uitbority locally and in the adjacent desert, would lead to constant strife and the formation of parties among his people, whilst the Turkish Agency would become a focus for domestic and foreign intrigue which would probably involve the British Government itself at no distant date in difficulties at present not to be foreseen. Having done my best to reassure the Shaikh I leit and despatched my first telegram to Fao. 4. On the following day the Shaikh came to see me with particular reference to our conversation described above. I was surprised as he was not very well at the time and even if in good health he seldom returns an informal visit on the following day. He had evidently been considering what 1 had told him and had realised that, though his refusal to accept a Turkish official in Kuwait might be sincere enough and couched in the most emphatic terms, he would be unable to persist in that refusal should the British Gov ernment have accepted the principle of representation and should the Porte demand its fulfilment. On this occasion the Shaikh first reiterated his previous arguments, every whit as vehemently, then he pointed out that Colonel Meade’s Agreement of January 1899 was framed with the sole purpose of preventing what we now suggested as likely to come about, viz.^ the advent of foreign officials in Kuwait. Further, we had expressly named the Turkish Government, as one it was particularly desirable to exclude from Kuwait, in the lease agreement for Bandar Shweikh, concluded in October 1907. Besides at our suggestion he had repeatedly rejected German over tures though in doing so he was forfeiting the increase in his Customs revenue w r hich a German firm established in Kuwait would undoubtedly have contributed. He urged that he had faithfully observed his part of a bargain, which was now 14 years old, and had agreed willingly to it, because he realised its advantages to himself as well to us and all he desired was that the exclusion of foreigners might continue as heretofore. The Snaikh then enquired what had been decided with regard to the Baghdad Railway, in reply to which I gave him the gist of what had appeared in the news tele grams. observing that I had no official confirmation. The Shaikh evidently had at the back of his mind that his interests had been used by us in some bargain with the Turks, for he asked whether the settlement with the Porte only concerned Kuwait and himself or other Gulf questions and the Baghdad Railway. I replied that I fancied probably an agreement had been reached on all questions, for that was indicated by the news telegrams, though what I had received from the Residency related only to Kuwait. He was exceedingly perturbed by the idea of having to accept a Turkish official and reverted to the subject again and again saying there was no need to agree to that item, as the Turks were a beaten and weak nation now, apart from the fact that they never have had a representative in the place; the only occasion on which they attempted to force one upon him, a quarantine official some years before the establishment of the British Political Agency, he had turned the man out summarily. He went on to point out that from what I had told him, he failed to see why any concession need have been made to the Porte, he was content to remain as he was, his authority in the desert could not be disputed by the Turks, he was not and never had been subject to them, his position as “ Ruler of Kuwait and Chief of its tribes ” was not disputed, and if the Turks liked to address him as “ Kaimakam ” or by any other title, that did not alter the fact as he never so subscribed himself. He had the very strongest objections to the residence of a Turkish official in Kuwait, and he begged me to telegraph again, placing a special boat at my disposal for the despatch of the telegram. 5. I have given the conversations in some detail in order that the Shaikh’s attitude may be fully understood. To me his attitude is no surprise, and whenever the opportunity has occurred, 1 have endeavoured to present the local view, for it seemed important, seeing that these negotiations have been conducted without the Shaikh having been given any idea as to their course, that we should avoid concessions cf a nature likely or calculated to disturb ourown relations with the Shaikh and thereby affect our interests here detriment ally. In my letter No. 8 C. of the 30th April 1913, I attempted to forecast the manner in which the Draft Agreement of the 26th March was likely to be received and in the light of the Shaikh’s objections as now formulated, when for the first time he has been given some idea of the terms of the proposed agreement, I would invite a reference to the last three paragraphs of that letter. 6 . Though I fear it is probably too late now to hope for any material alteration in whatever may be the terms of the final draft of the Agreement, I feel compelled to record my conviction as to the probable effect of any agree ment which does not contain most of the emendations I have already ventured to submit, and more especially which does not provide for the exclusion of Turkish officials from Kuwait. There has been a growing tendency for some years on the part of Arabs to believe that the Christian Powers are determined to reduce Islamic nations to impotence, and the tendency has received no small impetus from the two ■wars in which Turkey has recently been engaged. The idea is reflected in the Egyptian Press, it is encouraged in the Ottoman Press, and is not absent from Muhammadan newspapers in India. So far as I have been able to ascertain, this idea has not yet crystallized generally into an accusation definitely anti- Dritish, though indications in that direction have not been wanting; in Kuwait the Shaikh more than any one else has combatted anti-British notions of this kind and has always held up the British Government as the only one which could be trusted to keep its word, deal even-handed justice, not to diseriminare between the religious beliefs of its subjects and not to oppress the weak. Nevertheless the power which cheap newspapers, whose very names were unknown in Kuwait ten years ago, can exercise on ignorant minds inclined to believe that all Arabic pr ; nt in gospel is considerable, and I venture to think much under-rated by us, who are in the habit of estimating at its true value what is purveyed by various organs, and the effect is undoubtedly noticeable in Kuwait to-day. At the same time there is not one Kuwaiti in a thousand who would prefer to be a Turkish rather than a British subject if he Mere now ottered the choice. Most Kuwaitis have had sufficiently intimate dealings with Turks and their officials to thank God that their own Ruler is in fact independent and under the protection of the British Government; I have had as much expressed to me time and again, the moral being pointed frequently by a grateful reference to our action in past times in landing British blue-jackets for the defence of Kuwait and in the summary dismissal of Turkish men-of-war when they appeared in Kuwait harbour. Consequently local oeneral opinion has accepted as a settled fact that Kuwait is on the wa y eventually to become a British protected state similar to Bahrain, that formal pronouncement of that position would probably be deferred until the death of Shaikh Mubarak, and that all things considered the position is about as good as could be secured particularly as it would continue and confirm Kuwait’s present freedom from Turkish interference and the attentions of venal Turkish officials. 7 . While the above may not appear germane to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement, it may serve to show the general attitude of the people and the Ruler, who'are the most nearly affected by that Agreement. The Agreement, as it Stands in the Draft, will in reality give nothing whatsoever to the Ruler of Kuwait or his people which they have not enjoyed for years, while to them it will appear—owing to the clause permitting a resident Turkish A cr ent—rather as a formal delivery of Kuwait into the hands of lurkey by the Power which has hitherto safeguarded them from the menaces of that very Power. I confess even I find it difficult to avoid some such conclusion when the Agreement contains clauses («) acknowledging Turkish suzerainty, hitherto disputed, ( 6 ) permitting a Turkish official in Kuwait, hitherto strenuously opposed,*(tf) maintaining Turkish military posts, hitherto protested against as encroachments, {d) circumscribing boundaries hitherto unquestioned and actually maintained, and {e) recognising the Buler of Kuwait as a Turkish official, hitherto denied. In the effort to reconcile the Agreement, should it materialise as proposed, with the actually existing position, the Shaikh and his people will ask themselves the inevitable question “ what has induced the4 British Government to make this agreement concerning us, so seriously to our detriment, and that too when Turkey is of no account in the world ? ” The answer locally is obvious, viz., that Kuwait has been made use of by the British Government to obtain something else, a recognition of other claims elsewhere, a concession in regard to the Baghdad Railway, and the like. When it is remembered further that the Ruler of Kuwait has not been con sulted during the negotiations, has not been informed as to their course, and is to be presented with a fait accompli of some such description, I submit it is not unreasonable to expect the deepest disappointment and resentment at our action. How that resentment will affect our future relations I am loathe to contemplate, but I feel sure that its effect will not be merely local—it will affect us along the whole Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf by shaking the confidence which our support has hitherto inspired. No amount of explanation will ever remove the impression that we have used Kuwait as a pawn to secure other advantages for ourselves, more especially if some such advantages later become manifest, as, for instance, a settlement in our favour of the Baghdad Railway question. 8 . It may be said I have exaggerated the probable disappointment, and overrated its possible effect. It may be so but with over four years* ex perience of Kuwait, its Ruler and its people, with whom the discussion of high politics on the mischievous lines supplied by the vernacular press occupies almost their whole leisure, I feel it to be my duty even at this late hour to endeavour to obtain some reconsideration of what appears to be almost a com pleted document, when that document seems calculated to destroy with a stroke of the pen a position which we have been at no small expenditure of energy and money to consolidate in Kuwait, particularly, during the last ten years or more.

Telegram?., No. 948, dated the 27th (received 28th) May 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. In consequence of the precarious state of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s health as previously reported, no intimation has, up to the 20th May, been made to him as regards the terms of the draft Convention respecting Kuwait. I, however, instructed Political Agent to communicate verbally to the Shaikh as from myself a general idea of what we believed to be the probable terms of the document in view of the foregone cast of Convention contained in Beuter’s telegrams of the 17th instant, which ordinarily go to Kuwait; and impressed on His Highness when so doing that his general position had been satisfactorily assured and that it had no doubt been necessary to adopt a give and take attitude in regard to some points detailed as is necessary in the case of all amicable agreements in order to achieve a satisfactory position for His Highness. The Political Agent now wires that the Shaikh has received fairly well his communication as a whole, but that His Highness “ expressed in strongest and most vehement manner his absolute refusal ever to permit residence of any Turkish Agent in Kuwait. ” Later on, after sleeping over the matter, Shaikh came over to see the Political Agent in an agitated state of mind and reiterated his refusal asking that it should be communicated to Government of India. His Highness pointed out that his engagements with us had been undertaken expressly as a defence against this contingency and that he had faithfully observed these engagements. Political Agent goes on to state that there is evidence that Shaikh believes that his interest may have been sacrificed as regards this item for some quid pro quo and expresses the belief that short of strongest coercion nothing will alter attitude of Shaikh. The explanation given in Poreign Department tele gram dated 13th July 1912, does not carry weight with him. I earnestly hope the Government of India will be able to get this item eliminated, firstly, it is really a modification of status quo ; secondly, as I have already urged {vide my telegram No. 690, dated 6th July 1912), His Highness in bis capacity of Kaimmakam is himself a representative of Turkish interests: or perhaps Shaikh could get round the difficulty by appointing one of his sons for the special purpose of dealing with Turkish cases and interests. The present disturbing situation at Basrah and Katif seems to offer us an excellent opportunity to warn Turkish Government of His Highness’s refusal and of the danger at present juncture of rendering him hostile and the importance of getting Convention pushed through without delay. I earnestly hope that some means for getting rid of or round legislature (article ? difficulty ?) will be sought by the Government of India. MEMORANDUM.

May I he permitted to ask whether the question of Baghdad-Basrah Railway has yet been decided ? I would respectfully point out, if this question has not been settled, that with a view to the future it might not be prudent to exchange the prospective railway interests for the immediate advantages of navigation. The railway will, it is possible, and to me it seems probable, put an end to navigation. The Indus case is not quite similar, but in that case there are no (appreciable ?) steamers (it has no) (and ?) it is said that down stream traffic by native boats is dying out and there a railway now exists on each bank. Prime interests here, in my humble opinion, are firstly irrigation and secondly railway: the question of future navigation, especially in the event of the rivers being tapped by canals, is nothing more than problematical.

Shaikh should be given to understand clearly that so far from his being sacrificed for quid pro quo this forms part of the price which he has to pay for permanent establishment of his position on treaty basis and for recognition of his ample claims. Moreover seeing that there will be British Agent at Kuwait that the Turks bind themselves not to interfere in internal and external affairs or succession, and that the Shaikh is so long as he keeps his engagements with us, formally assured of our support, admission of Turkish Agent is regarded by His Ma jesty’s Government as purely pro forma and therefore it is hoped, in view of the identity of our interests with his, that Shaikh will acquiesce in an arrangement to which we would never have agreed had we apprehended any danger therefrom. The greatest importance is attached by His Majesty’s Government to the Shaikh’s acceptance of the agreement as it stands and the Political Resident should proceed to Kuwait himself, if necessary. If Shaikh is amenable, please consider whether some further honour might not be bestowed upon him. * Not to Political Kesideut.Telegram ?., No. 1028 , dated (and received) the 7 th June 1913 .

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percv Cox, tCC.I.E., C.S.I, Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my telegram No. 1223 of 9th instant l have the honour to report in fuller detail what passed at my interviews with tne Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in connection with the Anglo-Turkish Convention. 2 . I arrived at Mohommerah in His Majesty’s Ship “ Sphinx ” on the evening of 4th instant and was fortunate in finding Shaikh Mobarak still staying with the Shaikh of Mohammerah. Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Kuwait, had also arranged to rendezvous with me there. 3. On the morning of 5th Major Haworth and l had a long interview with the Shaikh of Mohammerah alone. We read him a translation of the Agreement regarding the Frontier, as initialled, but described the course of it from its point of contact with the Khaiyin, to the sea, as indicated by the line shown in the map, in emendation of the description given in the Convention. Having to some extent forgotten the details of w'hat passed at our interview with him of 20th D xt n a , a August 1912, Shaikh Khazal was inclined Xx Vide Residency letter No. 1936, dated 25th ^ &amp; ,11 r 1 1 r August 1912, to the Government of India in the to start oIq nares on the boundary line. Foreign Department. suc j 1 as m id-channel theory; but on the whole, except for the necessity of travelling over old ground again, we had miiLLituu.—The Shaikh did not again raise the question connection, ” in reference to the relation of islands to the -ifiaTn-land at low water; while on the subject of Hakki Pashas’ reservation in regard to the Khaiyin lands, he was surprisingly sensible, confident no doubt in the thought that in view of established local facts, it has no concrete signi ficance. 4. We then went on to deal with the question of the Riverain Commission, in which connection translations of such of the provisions of the Convention as affect Mohammerah were read and explained to the Shaikh. He was very uneasy as to the probably troublesome results which might be expected to ensue from the control of the whole of the waters of the river, and vessels afloat thereon, by a Turkish Commission, and from the inevitable activities of its subordinate'employes. In discussing this problem he again raised the question of the mid-channel line, arguing that from the point where the Karun, a Persian river, joins the Shatt-al-Arab, it surely was only fair that Persia should share the possession of the river. But as Haji Rais was not present on this occasion and we had already been talking for over three hours and the Shaikh was getting tired, we were unable to dispose of the question of the Commission at this sitting and therefore adjourned, leaving the translation with the Shaikh for further study and discussion with Haji Rais, and with the intention of finishing with it at the Shaikh’s return visit to me. Meanwhile, and indeed all along, the latter expressed his firm intention, after talking things out, to comply with our final advice in the matter. 5. Before parting company I asked him to arrange with his guest, Shaikh Mobarak, for me to visit him the following forenoon, and told Shaikh Khazal briefly what I had to say to the former. He himself took a sensible view of the question of the location of a Turkish Agent, recognising its one convenient aspect, t.e., as an indication of Shaikh Mobarak’s autonomous position ; and he promised to endeavour to influence his friend in the right direction. 6 . At Shaikh Khazal’s visit to the Consulate on 7th, he was accompanied by Haji Rais, and they brought an old volume of treaties in Persian, containing the text of the Treaty of Erzeroum, relying on which they started the mid channel question again. All the old ground had to be gone over once more, but the Shaikh and his factotum were ultimately persuaded that the recognition of the Turkish claim to the whole river as provided by the Treaty of Erzeroum, C42FD2 with the alternative of an appeal to the Hague, had been a necessary step in order to secure, in the Shaikh’s own interests, the frontier that he wanted frorn the Duvvairij southwards to the Khaiyin : and that no useful object would result from any attempt to reopen that question now. 7. This point having been finally disposed of, the question of the powers of the Riverain Commission and the delegation of Mohammerah interests to* the care of the British Commissioner was then gone into. We found that the right of the Commission to deal with vessels in touch with the Persian Bank greatly exercised both the Shaikh and Haji Rais, especially in view of the wording of the sentence in the declaration stipulating that the functions performed by the Commissioner supervising the interests of the Shaikh of Mohammerah must be discharged without prejudice to his quality as a Member of the Turkish Com mission. The Shaikh feared the contingency of the British Commissioner, perhaps a stranger to himself, being over-influenced by his Turkish r6le and perhaps led to act against Mohammerah interests arbitrarily without consulting its Ruler. We endeavoured to persuade him that his apprehensions on this point were premature and that the British Commissioner would surely receive all such preliminary instructions from the British Government as might be necessary to ensure Mohammerah interests being really protected. Eventually we arranged in concert the draft of a letter of acceptance for the Shaikh to send me, and this f ^ he did in due course. I attach a transla- Enclosure 1. S Vt lA tion thereof and trust that the Shaikh’s ‘ accompanying stipulation will not be considered inconvenient or unreasonable. After settling the terms of this draft we adjourned to other matters of business. I need not dilate upon the extreme importance of letting the OhMkh feel that the British Commissioner will really be'in sympathy with him and see tnat his interests are fully protected. To this end I would urge Government to be pleased to consider the expediency of putting forward for selection as British Commissioner the names of officers conversant with the politics and if po*sibl«— the languages of the Shatt-al-Arab region, as beipg.^ly-to fmjtf fl of establishing confidence and sympathetic relations with the bhaikh. 8. I now beg to turn to my dealings with the Shaikh of Kuwait. Captain Shakespear and I interviewed him at Failiyeh on 6th July, sha &gt;^ Khazal being also present. I took up the’thread w.th bhaikh Mobarak from the point where the Political Agent had left it, as reported in my telegram No. 948, dated 27th May. ' ^ A translation of the Articles of the Convention dealing with Kuwait, includ ing the extradition clause, as framed in the Secretary of State s telegram of 17th Tu^e—alternative (ii) was read to him. He demurred somewhat at the excision of Umm Kasr and Safwan but had apparently resigned himself to^their loss and as regards the jest of the boundary he acquiesced in it practically without remark. In the remainder of the Kuwait articles there were three points on which he had something to say — (i) the clause in article (2), providing for the location of a Turkish Agent at Kuwait. (ii) the use of the word “ Khalaf ” “ successor” and not “ aolad ” =* sons in article 2. (hi) the clause providing for the establishment of Customs Offices in article It was Item (i) with which the discussion which followed was mainly concerned, but it will be more convenient to dispose of (ii) and (iii) first. 9. As regards the question of terminology in (ii), I was not positive off-hand what the Arabic word used in previous engagements with him was, but without pursuing that point it was explained to him that as the Turks had expressly undertaken not to interfere in the succession, it seemed of little consequencesp in from result rs of 0 the right reatly ng of y the ist be Com- iioner, 5 and lulting point 1 such iry to anged d this •ansla- laikh’s )le, ers of h feel e ttiat to be British &gt;ssibl» hance Shaikh )in the • 948 , ^■'76 includ- Df 17 th xcision )ss and without 1 which 1 Agent id ” =; article mainly )ff*hand without ^pressly equence whether this particular Convention used the word “ successor ” or some other cognate expression, as the question was one which rested between himself and us alone. Without the Arabic text it was difficult to say more on this point than what 1 have recorded above ; bat it is referred to in the Shaikh s letter to me and my reply.* It will be found that *En.losses 3 and 4. i n the Shwaikh Agreement the word “sons” (aolad) was not used as the Shaikh thought, but the word “ heirs” (war as ah X ' and that we managed to fence with the yide correspondeace endine with Foreign dynastic issue then raised by the Shaikh. Department letter No- ioS4-E : B., dated 16th wr itten ^ply tO the latter (enclosure 4) March 190 . -v,; N'' leaves the ques.tipn in the same position as did the Shw'aikh Agreement, and I shall be glad to know what further, if anything, His Majesty’s Government would wish me to say to him. It might be worth while, if Shaikh Mobarak himself wishes it, that we should offer to recognise his successor—presumably his sqn and deputy Shaikh Jabr in his life time This would probably set his mind at rest completely as regards his own succession and lead him to forget or drop all further efforts to secure a permanent dynastic guarantee. I solicit telegraphic orders on this point. (ni). The Customs clause, at which he at once called a halt, brought us on to somewhat delicate ground, but it seemed to me that the best line to take was that the Article discussed contingencies which might never take shape, so that in any case it seemed premature to come to issue over them now. v\ e went on to explain that if the railway did eventually come to Kuwait, it would obviously be unreasonable for him to expect to receive the duty, or all the duty, on through cargo, and that in any case a preliminary discussion and arrangement would have to be arrived at between the Porte and ourselves, acting in his behalf, for regulat ing the H’rjrihnt 1 ^ 1 ^ 4, lllL tfnrtCT mi iliigagh export or import cargo at Kuwait in ^ MlTTT t?fTldrboth to himself and to Turkey. In regard to local cargo his rights would of course have to be specifically separated or safeguarded. I expressed the personal view that this was an instance in which our interests and his would be the same and that it would be our business to see that he was fairly treated, bhaikh. Khazal gave useful help in getting Mobarak to view this question in a 5 e nVib 1 ehg ft t 10. We now come to his main objection, the clause requiring him to receive a Turkish “ Commissaire ” or Agent in Kuwait. Here, to begin with, Shaikh Mobarak was bluntly uncompromising, saying that it was one of the specific and chief features of his agreements with us that he should refuse to receive the agent of any Foreign Power, including Turkey, apd thatThead mission of any representative on the part of the Turkish Govern ment in Kuwait was the one thing that he had been always determined to resist ft I'outrance and had up to now succeeded in withstanding. Then followed a long discussion in which the case of Egypt and the argument that the appointment was a useful indication and necessary result of the recognition of his administrative autonomy were made the most of. Eventually he agreed, provided that I would confirm the purport of their message in writing, to bow to the will and advice of His Majesty’s Government, relying on their assurance of the identity of our interests and on the enjoyment of their efficacious support in case of need against the activities and intrigues on the part of the Turkish Agent which he instinctively apprehended, and which he feared would prove no less a woiry to ourselves than to him I was not specially authorised to give him the purport of the Secretary of States’s telegram in writing ; but I do not think I should have got bis assurance in writing without it, and my refusal to give it would have aroused undesirable suspicion of our good faith in his mind. 11 . We separated a few minutes later and he subsequently sent me the ✓''M 1 t letter of acceptance of which I attach U Enclosure 3. translation. The first portion is based on lines suggested to him by myself, the remainder, from the words ‘ I would only represent ” onwards, is not meant by him to detract from his acceptance ; but merely reminds us of the three questions of Succession. Customs, and Admis sion of European foreigners to Kuwait in connection with which he either4 foresees difficulty and claims our support, or feels that the situation needs clearing by the light of the Convention. With the first two matters I have dealt sufficiently in the foregoing paragraphs. As regards the third—his future attitude towards foreigners— Shaikh Mobarak incidentally referred to the question of the overtures^made to him in the past by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., and enquired whether his obligation to admit a Turkish Agent involved any obligation or permission to admit other foreigners. I replied that our advice to him to keep Messrs. Wonckhaus and others at a safe distance had reference partly to the indefinite nature of his status vis d vis the Turks, a fact which was likely to afford such persons opportunities for intrigue. I continued that my personal view was that the regulation and establishment of his status by the present Convention somewhat altered the position, but I explained that the terms of the Convention only provided for and referred to the admission of a Turkish Agent, and did not affect his existing understanding with us as regards others ; so that I considered that it was still obligatory for him to consult us before admitting other foreigners, i concluded, however, that I would, if he desired, make a fresh reference to Government with regard to the case of Messrs. Wonckhaus and ascertain their views. Shaikh Mobarak agreed that that was the best course to pursue, and I trust that I shall receive instructions on the point. 12. Though there is no doubt that by the achievement of the Convention with Turkey, Shaikh Mobarak’s position, provided that he has our staunch support in repelling the slightest encroachment by the Turks on the terms of it, is greatly improved, yet there can equally be no doubt that in virtue of our engagements with Kuwait, more especially Articles 5, 9, 10 and 12 of the Shwaikh Agreement, we bear a very serious and lively responsibility towards the Shaikh ; and I therefore venture very respecttully to draw pointed attention to those Articles now and to express the earnest hope that we shall demonstrate to the Shaikh and to the Porte, from the moment the Convention comes into operation, our fixed intention to protect Shaikh Mobarak’s interests to the utmost. 13. Before concluding this somewhat lengthy report, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity, now that those portions of fhe Convention anecting^ the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah are practically completed, of recording my acknowledgments for the loyal co-operation which I have received through, out from Captain Shakespear and Major Haworth, the Political Officers accredited to those potentates, at my recent interviews and in the spade work done on the spot in connection with the details. I have the more reason to appreciate this in that owing to the absence of direct telegraphic communication with either port, and the fact that many of Government’s references needed speedy telegraphic reply, I have been unable always to consult them before replying as freely as I should wish to have done; but Government will, l am sure, appreciate the fact that the amenable demeanour of the Shaikhs is due in no inconsiderable measure to the happy relations existing between them and the two Political Officers attached to them. I also wish at the same time to commend to Government the excellent work done and valuable assistance rendered to me by Captain A. T. Wilson, in connection with the Mohammerah frontier question. 14. I am sending copies of this communication to His Majesty’s Minister and to the Political Secretary, India Office, for information. Enclosure 1.

Translation oj letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Sir Mobarak bin Subah, K.C.I.E., Shaikh of Kuwait. j ' * (IVo. 300, dated 6th July /grj.) 0 ^ ' ( ^ ^ After compliments, At my interview with Your Honour and our friend Sardar Arfa (Shaikh of Mohammerah) to-day, I told Your Honour of my having learnt from Captain Shakespear of your being somewhat disturbed by the condition in the Convention dealing with the location of a Turkish representative at Kuwait. I informed Government of the anxiety which you felt on the subject and to-day I have informed you verbally of the terms of their response. I also explained to you my personal view that the mere existence of the necessity of appointing a Turkish Aganl jvould be ra ther a useful indication of the adminis trative aiuorruwy ufyour Government. As you requested I now write to you 4he*purport of the communication which I was instructed to make to you, so that you may have it by you. In it Government intimate that in their opinion the points which you have conceded in the course of this agreemejit—which was on a give and take basis— yon Trrmrrregard ifs tfre pfiYe' patd in exchange for the great advantages which you derive from it. Among them the confirmation of your independence on the basis of this Convention, and the formal recognition of your extensive claims. Further, it is not hidden from Your Honour that the Sublime Porte undertakes not to interfere in the question of succession or in the internal or external affairs of your administration, and you are also aware that there will always bean Agent of the British Government accredited to you at Kuwait ; again, it is established inyourifnnd that you have the formal assurance of the British Government to support you in your affairs, so long as you faithfully observe your engagements to us as you have in the past. Having regard to all these considerations and after these explicit explana tions, the British Government is confident N that Your Honour will realise that the matter of the appointment of a Turkish Agent at Kuwait is one of the nature of a formality and that there is no cause for you to be alarmed and disturbed thereby. In conclusion I am directed to assure you that there is no divergence between your interests and those of the British Government, and that if they had seen in this detail anything harmful or dangerous for Your Honour, they would not have approved of it or recommended it for your acceptance.

Translation of letter from Sir Mobarak bin Subah y K.C.I.E., Shaikh of Kuwaiti to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accepting Convention. yV (Dated, Mohammerah, yth July /p/j.) I have received your esteemed letter of the 6th July 1913 (1st Shaaban I 33 1 &gt;) an d understood its contents, in confirmation of what you explained to me verbally at our interview to-day, (*.*., 6th July). I6 I trust you will inform the British Government that I recognise and admit the force of your explanations that my interests and those of the British Govern ment are identical and that there is no difference between them ; and accordingly it is incumbent on me to rely upon the advice of the Great Government in this matter; but they will, I am sure, understand that when any doubt enters my mind and I see in any measure a probable source of difficulty and danger to my own interests or those of Government, it is proper for me to communicate my apprehensions for their august views. But in view of your explanations and letter under reply, I can but bow to their view and authorise Your Honour to say that I shall rely on the Great Government to support me so long as I am firm in faithful fulfilment of my engagements with them as in the past ; please God I shall preserve those obligations and increase my intimate attachment to the Great Government and shall act up to what is written in our Treaties and even more than that. I would only represent to you that among the stipulations in our Treaties and in the agreement regarding the lease of land at Bandar Shwaikh, my “ sons” are specified as my successors, while now in the condition as arranged between the two Governments, the word “ Khalaf ” appears. Now “ Khalaf ” (succes sors) includes sons Again in our Treaties I am described as not agreeing to the presence in Kuwait of the subjects of any foreign Government, especially the Turkish Government. These are two points in our treaties and further in the documentary agree ment between yourselves and me in regard to the lease of land at Shweikh, I stipulated that the right of levying Customs duty on your subjects and others belonged to me, and on this understanding the agreement was reached, and I have the deed and you also have a duplicate. I have explained to you these three points, please give them your high consideration. And whatever was included in the Treaty was with the concur rence of both parties and the agreement regarding the lease of land at Shweikh was also concluded with the concurrence of both parties. I beg to refer this tCL. Your Honour’s consideration, and attention, and t he decision re sts^ th,.you. (Sealed) MOBARAK BIN SUBAH. Enclosure 4. Translation of letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Sir Mobarak bin Subah, K.C.I.EShaikh of Kuwait. {No, 30! t dated Mohammerah, the jth July 1913) After compliments, I have duly received your esteemed letter, dated 2nd Shaaban 1331 (= 7th July 1913), and understood its contents. I am highly obliged for your compli ance with the views of the British Government. Your Honour drew attention (in the same communication) to certain items contained in the Treaties and engagements existing between the British Govern ment and yourself. Your friend has not got the text of them here in Moham merah, except the translation of the agreement executed between yourself and Colonel Meade, Resident in the Persian Gulf, on 23rd January 1899. The purport of that instrument is that Your Honour would not receive an agent from any foreign Government without previous reference to and the concurrence of the British Government. In the course of the present negotiation it was necessary for the British Government to acquiesce in the appointment oi an Agent of the Turkish Government at Kuwait as the price of the recognition of the adminis trative autonomy of your Government and in return for the other advantages accruing to Your Excellency, as set forth in the document in question.Secondly, with reference to the use of the word f ‘ successor ” (Khalaf ”) instead of the word “ sons ” (aolad) therein. There was no motive behind this. For you are aware that as stipulated in the Convention, the Turkish Govern ment specifically refrains from concerning itself with this question, and agrees not to interfere in connection therewith. Consequently, in my opinion, everything that is recorded in this regard in the agreements between the British Govern ment and yourself holds good and is not altered. But, as I have not got the documents with me, I will, on arrival at Bushire after careful examination, write to Your Honour in confirmation of above, and if I see any point that arouses doubt, I will refer to Government. I am leaving to-night and I send you cordial greeting and the hope that pending our next meeting you may enjoy the best of health. (Sd.) P. Z.

The translation I left with Shaikh Mobarak was not in any way authoritative; it was what I evolved with Munshi on the way over to read to the Shaikh, and as in the read ing of it there seemed to be no particularly in doubt, I left it with him, thinking that I had a copy, but I must have tom up the original thinking that that which I sub sequently gave the Shaikh was my office copy. My translation also included an additional clause re garding reciprocal expulsion of bad characters. As soon as the instrument has been finally approved and signed up a copy and official translation will be sent to the Shaikh officially. Meanwhile nothing that we can give him has full authority. As a matter of fact I translated the sentence referred to in your demi-official letter of 22nd July from an Eng lish version which we made at Sabzabad and which ran as follows; 'In the event of the Shaikhdom becoming vacant the 'Imperial Ottoman Government will by Imperial barman. .ain W.H.I.Shakespear, Political Agent, K o we i t.'nominate as Kaimakam the successor of the late Ruler'. I agree that 'late' had better be 'deceased' and that 'vacance' here presumably means death; your translation 'Hakan khula al mashaikat' seems quite all right, but I do not consider tha^nominate a Kaimakam from one of those who // follow etc., is a permissible of nominate his of 'nommera Kaimakam le successeur du Shaikh defunt'. I enclose a copy of the French Text as initialled and pending arrival of the final instrument you might usefully EiaxHlxs devote your energy to going through the Shaikh’s translation and seeing if thre are any points &lt;xh which seem to need alteration, or if you prefer, make a fresh transla tion. Your remarks regarding ’Khalafhu min zariathi’ which he has got from Shaikh Khazal I think raise the whole ques tion of the dynastic guarantee and I have raised that in my official letter to Foreign.

I have the honour to revert to the question of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s desire for a dynastic guarantee, last referred to in the Government of India's telegram of 9th August to His Majesty's Secretary of State. Since our interview in the Shatt-el-Arab on 7th July, and the despatch of my letter No.2102 of 10th idem to Government, Shaikh Mubarak has repeatedly asked the Political Agent whether there was any reply from Government on this point, and at my recent visit he reverted to the subject of the Convention generally and the question of succession in particular. 2. / I was glad to find that he had quite reconciled kM himself to the presence of the Turkish Agent and agreed with us that the chances were that he would generally scgzKis be able to keep the Agent in his pocket, as Shaikh Khazal does the Persian Karguzar, while if the Agent gave trouble he would be able to get rid of him with our assistance. As regards the Customs contingency too, he realised that it was remote at present, and that relying on our cooperation when the time came, he would not concern himself about it meanwhile. the In the matter of/reception of foreigners, e.g. Messrs Wonckhaus, be readily accepted our view and would admit none except under our advice. 3. He then turned to the question of the succession, and asked me what Government had said on that point. I replied that they had apparently not found it possible to give me any special reply or instructions on that point. I went on to explain to him that His Majesty's Government naturally had to be very chary of committing themselves to guarantees of this sort for all time and without conditions to safeguard them in certain eventualities and thatthat in his case, seeing that the Turks had trgreed in the present Convention to abstain from all interference in the question of succession, it was consequently simply a matter concerning himself and us, and I did not quit© see v/hat reason he had to be anxious about it. Thinking it a pity to lose the opportunity of getting at his real feelings, I continued that Captain Shakespear and I would, as he knew, shortly be going home on leave and that we three might not have another opportunity of a quiet talk together, so could he not, now that we were on the subject, confide to us what he really had in mind so that we might understand the position exactly and be in a position to make any further explanation to Government that might be indicated. He readily responded. He said he quite under stood the difficulty of His Majesty f s Government in such questions and did not want to nominate anybody now as his presumptive successor, nor did he press for anything in writing; but that what exercised him was the thought or the fear that when the time came for him to go, some individual or individuals from among his family or kinsmen who found themselves disappointed might engineer active discord which, if we held aloof might rack the principa lity and undo hie lifework as Shaikh in the direction of consolidation and improvement. V/hat he so much wanted was to be able to feel assured that when he joined the majority, provided that we had no reason to differ from his wishes at the time or his testamentary dispositions if he went suddenly, we would, in case of necessity stand by and even intervene to regulate the situation. We told him that we quite appreciated his point of view and would place it fully before Government for sympathetic consideration. 4.

I think aw might write to the Sha’kh as fellows:- Whereas under the terms of the Anglo-Turkish Convention the two Governments have agreed that:- w x x x In event of decease the Imperial Ottoman 'Government will designate the successor of the deceased 'bhAikh, Qaimmaqam by Imperial Farman. x x x ', and whereas Your honour has urged that this wording affords no assurance to yourself that your 'successor' in the Rulerahip of Kuwait be from among the heirs of your body and have asked the British Government to reassure you with an undertaking to that effect, the Great aavrsnoBi Government have considered the matter and I am to infom you as fol lows The British Government have recognised the statesmanship and Vise control ?;ith which you have conducted your admin istration and have fully appreciated the friendliness and cordiality with which you have always endeavoured to co- ^ operatecooperate with them in their mission of promotion of order and good government on tho shoree of the Persian Gulf, and in return for which they have been glad to support you in your legitimate aspirations for increasing the prosperity and civilisation of your Principality. They therefore ngard you aa a truo friend wnose wishes for the future of his possession they w uld in principle bo glad to support. You will underFt nd ho?ovor that it would be impossible for Government to eemmit themselves blindly to support the suc cessor of your choic. whoever ho might prove to bo. They have no ob^ectlc-, however, in )lification of the passage in the Anglo-Turkir»h Convention above quoted, to assure you that provided that during your lifetime you will keep them confidentially infer sd of your vvi hoe regarding the designa tion of your on oessor, and provided th^t your nominee has the* r apr'n 'Vf 1 /f 11 as your* own, they will give him tl«eir moral amyort and endeavour to ensure that on your darr.ine your Principality shall be imnuun * from dissei- sion in con nection with your nominee^ succe^eion. It will bo under- ;itood this assurance 1 given to Your Honour poroonally In recognition of tho closeness of the relations which %xu have existed bot ocn the British Government and yourself.” I think something on thaee lin* s would satisfy him and does net appear to in* Ive in a y i-ore portontious action than that w© should probably taka in any case, I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, (od) P.2.Cox, Lieut-Colorel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
