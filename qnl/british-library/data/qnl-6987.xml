Liabilities of Persia. Tjctier from India Office to Foreign Office. P. 5924. India Office, Sir, 30th November 1920. In compliance with your request for a statement of the views of the Secretaiy of State for India in Council on the proposals made by Sir P. Cox in his Despatch No. 200 of ord December .1919 for the liquidation of Persia's debt to the Imperial and Indian exchequers, and with reference to Mr. Oliphant's letters Nos. C. 2454/2454/34 and C. 4619/2454/34 of 3rd August and 11th September, respectively, I am directed to forward to be laid before Earl Curzon of Kedleston a statement prepared by the Accountant-General of this Office of Persia's estimated liabilities on 8th March next, and four calculations of possible methods of liquidation. 2. As regards the statement of liabilities it has been assumed— (1) That the whole of the sterling loan of 1919 will have been paid out by 8th March. (2) That the kran moratorium (Ts. 350,000 per month) will not be continued after 24th October, the date to which the last payment has been sanctioned. (3) That, of the sterling loan of 1919, only Ts. 400,000 paid in August 1919 to Vossugh ed Dowleh have actually been advanced up to the present. It is understood that His Majesty's Government has not actually taken over from the Imperial Bank of Persia the Persian Government's debt of Ts. 500,000 recently advanced to finance measures of defence ; and at the same lime the book debits against the loan referred to in the Memorandum C. 199, furnished by this Office, have for the purpose of the present calculation been left out of account. (4) That arrears of interest at 7 per cent, should be claimed on the kran ' moratorium ' payments. An estimate of Ts. 928,454 has been included on this account in the statement of Persia's liability : an accurate calculation of the sum can probably only be made in Tehran, owing to ignorance here of the dates mentioned in para. 4 of Sir P. Cox's Despatch. Mr. Secretary Montagu does not overlook the fact that in the correspondence ending with Mr. Spicer's letter No. 151733/W./ 34, of 28th November 1919, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs held the opinion that it was too late to claim interest on these advances as no stipulation to this effect had originally been made to the Persian Government; but in para. 4 of his Despatch (which had not then been received) Sir P. Cox assumes that interest is to be charged, and that the only question is, at what rate. In view, however, of the uncertainty on the point, the second and fourth of the calculations for amortisation of the debt have been worked out on the basis of no claim being made for arrears of interest on the moratorium payments. 3. I am to add that in framing the estimate of Persia's liabilities in March next the sterling figures have been arrived at by converting krans at the actual rate of disbursement, where this is known, and at 30 krans to the pound for the remaining items. 4. There are certain points in Sir P. Cox's Despatch which are somewhat obscure :— {Para. 5.) The Secretary of State in Council has throughout been under the impression that the subsidy paid for the maintenance of the Persian Cossack Division is to be regarded as a war expenditure, for the repayment of which the Persian Government cannot be held liable. The Accountant-General has accordingly not included in his statement any ite?n under this head. Sir P. Cox was of course correct in including at the date of his despatch the subsidy for August, September and October 191'9 as a Persian liability : for it will be recollected that these instalments were sanctioned at the time only as advances out of the sterling loan. It was urged, however, in the Memorandum C. 199, to which The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury refer in Mr. Meiklejohn's letter of 21st August, that these and later instalments of this subsidy could not properly be regarded as instalments of the loan; and if this view is accepted no liability lies against the Persian Government under this head. {Para. 6.) It will be observed that the Accountant-General has been able to identify items 8 and 9 of Mr. Maclean's statement of outstanding advances, only on the assumption that they represent payments to the Farman Farma and Kawam,ul Mulk. If this assumption is correct, presumably no recovery can be expected from the Persian Government, but Mr. Secretary Montagu would be glad to receive further information on the point. He cannot, as at present advised, accept the suggestion made in para. 2 (h) of Mr. Oliphant's letter of 11th September that the expenditure in question should be borne wholly by Indian revenues, for although the Government of India may for convenience have financed the Resident at Bushire for the purpose of actually making the payment, it was presumably made in connection with one of the methods of assisting Persia agreed upon with His Majesty's 2860 50 12/20(■) Government; and, if so, one-half of the cost ■will be chargeable to your Department under the ordinary arrangements. An enquiry on the point is, however, being addressed to the Government of India {vide attached copy of telegram). 5. As regards the consolidation of Persia's debt and its repayment, I am to enclose an extract from a note by the Accountant-General of this Office. 6. With a view to facilitating the discussion of the questions raised therein, four calculations of the annual charge necessary to redeem the debt, have been prepared. All assume that— (i) there will be no change in the arrangements regarding the loan of 1903-4 ; (iij other loans are redeemable by equal annual payments extending over 20 years ; (iii) the rate of interest to be charged is 7 per cent.; but, whereas calculations (a) and (6) assume, as the estimate of liability assumes, that the whole of the 1919 loan of 2,000,000/. will have been paid, calculations (c) and {d) have been framed to meet the eventuality of the Mejliss refusing to ratify the Agreement of 1919 and of no further portion of the loan being paid than the sum of Ts. 400,000 paid in August 1919 (c/. para. 2 ^3) above). Calculations (6) and {d) differ from (a) and (c) respectively, in that the former assume that arrears of interest at 7 per cent, are to be claimed on the moratorium payments, and the latter that no arrears of interest are to be claimed (c/. para. 2 (4) above). 7. The annual charge to be imposed under calculation (a) would be almost as great as, and that under calculation (b) would be greater than, the receipts from the Southern Customs accruing even in the year 1918-19; but in view of the opinion expressed by the Financial Adviser in Mr. Norman's telegram No. 532 of 27th July, the Secretary of State in Council would venture to urge that it would be well for His Majesty's Government to present its claim to the Persian Government in the fullest justifiable form {i.e., as under calculation (?&gt;)), in order to obtain as complete a lien as possible on all security not yet pledged, as a guarantee for the amount by which the yield of the Southern Customs may prove deficient. He would recommend that until this is achieved His Majesty's Government should not forgo any claim for interest to which it may be entitled, nor unduly prolong the period of repayment nor otherwise modify its claim against the Persian Government. 8. As it is understood that Mr. Armitage Smith is now in this country. Lord Curzon will no doubt prefer to obtain his views before taking any final decision in the matter, and Mr. Secretary Montagu would in any case be glad to have time to ascertain the views of the Government of India by telegraph. 9. 1 am to add that he agrees with His Lordship {vide para. 2 (a) of Mr. Oliphant's letter of 11th September) that the expenditure incurred on the South Persia Rifles is not recoverable from the Persian Government. 10. A copy of this letter and enclosures is being sent to the Treasury. I am. Sir, Your obedient servant, The Under Secretary of State, J. E. Shuckburgh. Foreign Office.Enclosure No. 1.

Foreign Office suggest that advances to Bushire Government are possibly liability for which India alone is responsible. I cannot identify these advances which appear as item 9 in Tabular Statement, except on assumption that they are payments connected with item 8 to Farman Farina or Kawam. Please let me have full information.4 1 should be glad to have your views on Cox's proposals generally. Subject to them, 1 am proposing to Foreign Office scheme for consolidation and amortisation of debts admitted by Persian Government to be recoverable by annual charge security for which over and above that afforded by Southern Customs should be obtained by securing lien on all receipts not yet pledged. Papers by mail of 2nd December. Please telegraph your views as soon as possible as matter will be subject of active consideration as soon as Armitage Smith arrives. Enclosure No. 3. Extract from Note htj Accountant-General, India Office, dated 27th August 1920. v &gt;!*• v.? The consolidation of these loans and their repayment by means of equal monthly payments would be very convenient from an accounting point of view. Two practical difficulties would have, however, to be met. (1) Unless the krans were converted into £ once for all at some agreed rate, a single payment could not be iixed to cover the advances in both currencies. It would probably be necessary to have two annuities, one sterling and one kran. (2) The Imperial Bank of Persia are entitled to one per cent, interest on outstanding capital in respect of their remuneration for collecting sums due on the loan of 1903-04, and the advances of 1912-14. It would be necessary to consider this in arranging the method of repayment. Probably the Bank would demand some similar remuneration (which might perhaps be on a lower scale) in respect of the rest of the total advance. It would probably be convenient to leave untouched the arrangements for repayment of the 1903-04 loan, especially as the instalments of this annuity occupy a privileged position, being the only ones which precede the public loan (1,250,000/.) as a charge on the Southern Customs. Any decision as to the desirability of arranging for repayment by annuity will, however, in all probability, depend not so much on considerations of convenience in accounting as on the answers to two questions of a more strictly financial nature, viz. :— (1) To what extent are the Southern Customs Revenues sufficient to secure the annual sum necessary; and if the}' are not sufficient, can further security of adequate amount be obtained ? (2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative, is it wise to press Persia for heavy annual payments in the immediate future or for some years to come ?</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00035f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B357</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00035f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B357</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Liabilities of Persia.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1920/1920</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-01T14:47:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at 1 on the first folio and terminates at 2 on the last folio.
