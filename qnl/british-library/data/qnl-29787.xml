Subject: Deputation of a Customs Officer to the Muscat State. The Sultan has asked that inquiries be made from the I Government of India regarding obtaining the services of a Customs Officer on deputation to the Muscat State. 2. His Highness states that when the new Treaty comes into force next year many problems concerning Customs matters will have to be solved and these,he feels, can only be satisfactorily settled if someone with proper training and experience in such technical work is available. He would therefore he very grateful if the Government of India could assist him by lending him the services ol a qualified officer of their Customs service. 3. As regards rates of pay. The ^pltan is prepared to give up to fis 400 - 600 per mensem with free quarters and whatever leave and passage concessions the Government of India may consider suitable for ttie particular case. The Officer should be a Mohammaden and about forty years of age and be thoroughly conversent with the administrative side of Customs work. Period of service in first contract 2-3 years. 4. In view of the early approach of the date when the new Treaty is due to come into force i.e. 11th February 1939, the Sultan says that he would be graceful i(£'HW^66\ild be informed as early as possible whether a suitable officer could be made available for service in the State.

Would you please refer to my Express letter No.C/205 dated the 8th December 1938. 2. When the Sultan of his own accord made his request for me to enquire about the services of a Customs officer of the Government of India for employment in the State, I asiced him what he proposed doing with Duli Chand whose real work,as you are aware, is running the Customs. His Highness replied that directly he could obtain a suitable man from the Govern- ment of India he would dispense forthwith the services of K Duli Chand. 3. I gathered from the Sultans remarks that he had begun at long last to realise the real character of this individual and that he had been receiving many complaints about him from his own Walis and officials some of whom, he informed me, had reproached the Sultan bitterly for employing a Hindu. 4. I must admit that I was pleased to hear the Sultan’s request. Ther is, in my opinion, no doubt whatsoever that this Duli Chand is a thoroughly bad type - an unscrupulous intriguing mischief maker - who has been responsible for creating a considerable amount of bad feeling and discontent in the State both against the Sultan, and also between British subjects and the State, and I do trust it will be possible speedily for the sake of practically every single inhabitant The Hon'ble Lieut.

It is satisfactory that the iultan has turned to us for assistance in this way and it is most important that the jfiicer in question should be carefully selected. The terns offered by the Sultan seem to me adequate.

The most suitable Muslim Officer, in ray opinion at this Custom House for deputation to Musfcat, is Mohdo Ismail, an Appraiser, full particulars about whom are attached for the Board’s information. Apart from his excellent academic career, his work in the Appraising Department is definitely good and he himself is energetic, sound and thoroughly reliable. I believe that,x±£ if uppVr appointed, he would acquit himself creditiy. He is 30, but that is not a serious disqualification. I can thoroughly recommend Ismail. 3. Taking into account the unattractiveness of living at a place like Muscaty where it must be hot and unhealthy in more senses than one, I would suggest the following scale for Ismail:- Rs. 450-|fi -600, plus free quarters, leave and passage concessions. It is presumed Ismail would, if appointed, retain a lien on his present job. Yours sincerely, Hd/- S.N.Gupta, 13-1-1939.
