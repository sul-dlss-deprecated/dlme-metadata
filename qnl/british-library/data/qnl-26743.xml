Charge d f Affaires Chancery. RH EINMETALL-3QRS IG. Herr von WALDO^, a director of Rheinmetall-Borsig, called on me yesterday with Herr Arnold Kinkel, representing Schenker &amp; Co., a well known firm of Forwarding Agents. He informed me when making the appointment that he had received permission to come and see me from the Ausw&amp;rtiges Amt. It appears that Rheinmetall-Borsig, and one or two other German firms, whose identity was not divulged, have recently concluded the sale of a considerable amount of war material to the Afghan Government, Herr von Waldow gave no definite details of the exact amounts of material involved, but provided the folio?!ng information. (a) The total weight of war material involved is about 2000 tons. (b) No small bore infantry weapons or ammunition are included. (c) The orders include 2-cm. A.A. guns. 37-mm. A.T. guns and A.A. guns. 75—mm. A.A. guns, with complete equipment. 81-nim. Stokes type Trench Mortars. Ammunition for the above. A.T. Mines. Tanks. Herr von Waldow wanted to enlist my help and advice as regards getting this war material from Karachi to Kabul via the Khyber. The contract is for c.i.f. Karachi, and a substantial payment from the Afghan Government has already been received. In/In the contract the Afghan Government definitely hind themselves to obtaining the sanction of the India Government for the passage of the goods through India, Failing this, the delivery of the goods by some other route is envisaged, Herr von Waldov was uncertain as to whether the Afghan Government had already obtained the necessary sanction. The forwarding of the goods is being undertaken b 3 ^ Messrs, Schenker, who propose sending a representative in March to Karachi to confer with Messrs, Cox^ Shipping Agency at that Port. Actual delivery of the goods does not commence until September, but Rheinmetall are anxious to know how they stand in the matter, Herr von Waldov hoped that I had heard something of the affair, but I have, in fact, heard nothing. He rang up again this morning to say that he had been making further enquiries, and und.erstood that the Afghan Government had been in touch with the Indian Government regarding the matter. From my knowledge of India and the Khyber I was able to give Herr Kinkel a certain amount of information regarding how he might expect to have to deal with the consignments between Karachi and Kabul. I gathered that a large proportion of the goods would be in loads of about 400 lbs., that the largest loads would be unlikely to exceed some 3 tons, but that it was hoped to forward Tanks and other wheeled vehicles on their own wheels, at any rate from Peshawar to Kabul. It was probable that Messrs. Rheinmetall would wish to acquire accommodation in Peshaw'ar where their own mechanics would be able to carry out a certain amount of assembly work. I told Herr von Waldow that in the circumstances it was quite impossible for me to be of any assistance to them in the matter/matter, except in so far as I v.as able to give them a very ^ rough idea of the actual transport problem confronting Messrs. Schenker. It was quite impossible to do anything further in the matter without knowing the attitude that the Government J of India or H.M.G. was adopting to the Afghan request for permission for transit through India. I promised to inform the ■War office of the situation as explained by Herr von Waldow, and to inform Herr von Waldow as early as possible as to any instructions I might receive on the subject, and as to any information it might be possible to give him to facilitate the forwarding of the consignments through India, should such transit be approved by the Indian Government. I would like to stress the fact that Herr von Waldow was most anxious to impress upon me throughout that his firm wished to carry out the whole transaction - which he described as a purely commercial one - entirely aboveboard, and that the last thing they wished to do was to undertake any shipment of War Material through British Territory without ensuring that the British Government was previously informed, and their sanction obtained. It seems in many ways unfortunate that Germany has been enabled to succeed in selling a considerable amount of War Material to Afghanistan, but if things have got as far as they have, there seem to be obvious advantages in affording || transit facilities through India rather than having possibly unknown quantities of arms reaching Afghanistan by other routes. On the other hand such other routes as are available might well present very considerably greater transport difficulties/&amp;&gt; difficulties than the Khyber route. The Quetta - Khandahar - Kabul route was not mentioned and I did not make any reference to it. (Sgd.) Colonel, Military Attach^.1975. Telegram R.No.495 dated (and reed.) 22nd August, 1937.

Before I saw the India Office minutes, I had rung up Captain Tuckey and asked him whether the War Office had kept Colonel Kinsman informed of the position. He said he doubted it, but he would investigate and let me know later. In these circumstances, we had better await further before sending off the draft letter. Bring up September 27th. (Intd.) L.C. September 25rd. Later . The War Office now tell me that Vickers will be kept informed. No action is therefore necessary, except to copy these minutes to the India Office. (Intd.) L.C. September 25rd.0160/2007 (M.I.l.)* I am very sorry that we have not replied before to your letter No1165/2/97 of March 19th, - to which Napier sent a provisional reply on April 22nd, - on the subject of the supply of arms to Afghanistan. The matter has now been investigated and I am afraid that in view of our own rearmament programme and the interference which would be caused to it by the taking on of these orders for Afghanistan, all we can usefully offer at present are the 120 Vickers-Armstrong Heavy Machine-Guns Class •c*. Delivery of these could commence within 14 months of the date of the order, at the rate of 50 guns per month. we cannot at present hold out any possibility of supply of class f L f Light Machine—guns. As regards 75 m.m. A.A. equipments, ammunition and predictors, the best we can offer is manufacture commencing in 1939 and delivery, at the earliest, in April, 1940. The predictors would take longer to make but delivery could be made not later,than the guns, if the order was given in advance, as manufacture will comi ence earlier. In view of the orders which we understand that the Afghans have placed in Germany and the unlikelihood that they would be able to pay for purchases here it would not appear that any order for the arms included in Colonel Kinsman's list would be likely to eventuate, even if we v/ere able to offer earlier delivery dates.

He is also acting for the Ministry of Defence for the purchase of war material. He told me that owing to an understanding arrived at 'between the British and Afghan Governments during the visit of the Afghan Prime Minister to London a short time ago, he had received instructions to place as many orders as possible for war material with British Firms, provided the type of material, price and delivery were acceptable. He realised that the present is a difficult time for Armament Firms owing to the British Government’s demands. Consequently he wants to arrange the type of equipments and price, and then proposes to discuss the matter with the War Office, etc., as regards delivery. He went on to say that provided he comes to terms with us over price, etc., the order will be given through the War Office. He has already telegraphed to an Afghan Technical Officer, at present on the Continent, to come over and inspect the Anti-Aircraft Equipment and machine guns. He asks that we supply, as soon as we possibly can, the prices for the 75mm. A.A.Equipments with Predictor. These prices have already been asked for some time ago.

Burrows Esq. , foreign Office, ( ■ LgTTi 12 2 5MAR 1937 -M 0 — ornca eOPY 3cMT TO. OcJUja J S.W.l.65/2/97) Colonel Kinsman who, it will he remembered, had some dealings with us in February 1936 has spoken to me about these Afghan enquiries. He said that Fuhammad Ihsan, who was accompanied by Colonel Muhammad Arrf Khan, had appeared most anxious to purchase anti-aircraft guns and machine guns but had not seemed to know much about field guns or mountain guns. Colonel Kinsman had explained to them that it was impossible for Vickers in nresent circumstances to promise delivery on any date in the near future, but the Afghans had asked him nevertheless to ouote orices. He had informed Colonel Dennys at the War Office of these enquiries. Colonel Kinsman now wanted to know whether these enquiries should be regarded as serious and whether the War Office would allow Vickers to release the armaments required by the Afghans if the order was secured. Vickers could only complete the order with Y/ar Office permission since they are at present full up with orders for the War Office. The preparation of estimates for anti-aircraft and machine guns was proceeding, but Vickers did not want to embark on the lengthy and expensive preparation of detailed estimates for artillery etc. without knowing whether there was a good chance that the order might materialise. I do not know what the Afghans mean by the words quoted in Colonel Kinsman’s report ’’Owing to an understanding arrived at between the British and Afghan Governments during the visit of the Afghan Prime Minister to London”. This may, of course, just be a faulty interpretation of some phrase referring merely to the confirmation of the Prime Minister’s desire to establishcloser relations with His Majesty’s Government consequent on his friendly receotion in London. Most of the arms mentioned by the Afghans, apart from the nredictors, are similar to those which they told us some months ago they had ordered in Germany (See Kabul despatch No. 75 of May 30 in N 3252/593/97/1936). We have never heard any more about these arms. Very recently the Afghan authorities asked for facilities to be arranged for the transit across India of some guns, probably bought in Czechoslovakia, which were actually leaving Trieste. If what the Afghans have been saying to us about aeroplanes is true, they will not be able to pay cash for any of these arms, and whether or not we persuade the Government of India to enlarge their credit for aeroplanes it is almost inconceivable that they would want to finance the purchase of artillery and machine guns in view of their present large commitments connected with rifles and ammunition. I suppose that the War Office might allow Vickers to sell these arms to the Afghans if we and the India Office oressed them, but in the circumstances it seems that we can hardly do so. But before renlying to Colonel Kinsman’s enquiry we must find out their reactions. I submit a draft to Colonel Dennys for India Office concurrence, Colonel Kinsman’s letter and enclosure and the above minute should be copied to India Office. (Signed) B. A. B.

You will remember that you were then informed that enquiries would be made to ascertain whether His Majesty's Government had any available surplus old- pattern guns for sale. I regret that it has not been possible to acquaint you at an earlier date with the result of these enquiries, but it ha. been necessary to consult a considerable number or authorities; and although I understand that the Afghan Government have now ordered some munitions in Germany, including ten batteries of mountain guns, the following information may, nevertheless, be of interest to them. 2. His Majesty's Government could make available one complete reconditioned quarterworn battery comprising; 4 - 3.7' Howitzers, 4 Carriages, Gun stores (including spares), Battery staff stores, Pack Ali Mohammad Khan, etc., etc., etc.Pack saddlery, 2,000 rounds of ammunition* For this 'battery they would ask £12,750, the figure being based on the assumption that payment would be made on delivery.

Messrs.

The Afghan Government recently bought in Germany a certain amount of munitions^including 2,775 pistols. H.M.Minister, Kabul, has already been instructed to inform the Afghan Government that transit for these munitions through India will be allowed. In the F.O. minutes on this question Lord stanhope suggested that some of the pistols may filter across the Indo-Afghan borders into the hands of undesirables in India. Y/e sold the Afghan Government 5,000 .303 rifles^with ammunition^in 1935, and we are negotiating for the sale of a further 25,000 .303 rifles^also with ammunition. We recognise that there is the possibility of some of these rifles getting into the hands of the tribesmen on the N.W.Frontier. But it has been decided that the desirability of strengthening their poooooo-ion by the Afghan Government /of these rifles^outweighs this danger. pistols do not appear to play any substantial part in the armament of the Pathan tribes, but there is, presumably, a market for them in Bengal. They are probably less necessary to Afghan stability than rifles, but the consideration reierred to by Lord Stanhope would not justify us in a breach of our treaty obligations to the Afghan Government to allow transit for them. fLj A* j, J- . 11 ml g ht &gt; however, be possible to instruct H.M.Minister, Kabul, to remind the Afghan Government that there is a market for pistols in Bengal and that we hope that they will take special precautions to prevent any of these pistols getting into unauthorised hands.

A conflict arises between the Anglo-Afghan treaty of 1921, which obliges us to grant these facilities, and the treaty of Versailles, which forbids the export of arms from Germany. Legal arguments can be made out for either course. Local Asiatic considerations favour granting the request. They are briefly:- (1) We have ourselves not been able to supply promptly all the arms which the Afghans have asked us for and if we now obstruct this purchase, after condoning other breaches of the Versailles treaty, our action might seem to be either deliberately unfriendly to the Afghan Government, or intended to secure the contract for our selves. (2) Our obligations under the Anglo-Afghan treaty are more categorical than under Versailles. (5) If we refuse transit the arms will probably be bought from Russia, which is undesirable from a local point of view. The arguments against allowing transit are:- (1) France might protest at our breaking our obligation to her as a fellow signatory of Versailles. (2) Russia would probably protest on general grounds, as she is the most likely alternative source of supply. (3) Public opinion here might condemn any assistance, however slight, to the German armament industry, and it would be difficult to defend in Parlia ment and elsewhere our action in condoning and abetting a further flagrant breach of the Treaty by Germany. The/The Government of India leave the decision to His Majesty's Government. The India Office favour allow ing transit.

The Afghan Government have purchased in Germany, on a credit 'basis a suhstantial amount of munitions, including light and heavy machine guns, field and mountain artillery, '* anti-aircraft guns and tanks and pistols. The Afghan Government have asked H.M. Minister Ka^nl, in accordance with Article 6 of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 and letters Nos 1*2 annexed, for transit through India to 'be allowed to these munitions. A copy of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty has 'been placed on the file. 2 The position under the Treaty of Versailles in connection with this request requires consideration. Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles prohibits in Germany the manufacture for, and the export to, foreign countries of arms, munitions and war material of every kind. This places a precise obligation on Gennany and it gives us the right to protest to Germany against the present transaction. It imposes no obligation on cs ^ ^ ^ Afghanistan^ Sut the ' 7 question whether it imposes any obligation on India towards her co-signatories of the ^Vcs, Treaty of Versailles to refuse transit 0 JIas already been discussed in a preliminary way with the Foreign Office. This question has been the subject of discussion before, particularly in 1928 but in no previous case of the purchase of arms by Afghanistan has it been clearly established that the sale of material manufactured in, as apart from merely being exported in transit from Germany, was involved. The views of the Foreign Office Legal Adviser are contained in Mr. Fitzmaurice’s minutes of 10th Februar^and 17th February (both flagged H) and they suggest that although it is possible that India ^ay have an obligation under the Treaty of Versailles 4424 5000 1/36 to/ /'■N 'X' YC&amp;Xo&amp;O'a. &lt;5^2 ! to refuse transit, a colourable case could be made out irom a legal point of view in favour of allowing transit. 3 ^The practical arguments in favour of allowing transit seem extremely strong. Our obligations to the Afghan Government under the 1921 Treaty are quite explicit and are not limited by any condition regarding the origin of the arms. It would be quite impossible to make th e Afghans accept, or even understand, an argument that such indirect obligations as we may have under the Versailles Treaty take preference over our quite explicit obligations under the 1921 Treaty. They would look upon a refusal of transit facilities as an unfriendly act, particularly in view of the Ufai V. At reference^in the 1921 Treaty to the circumstances in which transit may be refused, and they would suspect that our action was a shallow device to force them to purchase arms from the United Kingdom (they have at various times made enquiries from the Government of India, H.M. G. and Messrs * Vickers for mountain guns, field guns and machine guns). The Afghans would justifiably ask v/hy we neglect the Disarmament clauses of theTreaty of Versailles when it suits uSjas it did in the case of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, but refuse to pass over sub silentio a breach of these clauses by Germany from which Afghanistan would profit. U The view has been taken in the Foreign Office that there is no question of addressing a protest to the German Government in this matter. This is understandable. But it makes it even less practicable to refuse transit to the Afghans. The latter would inform the Germans of our refusal; I no doubt representing our^ction as due to a desire to hinder ! the improvement of Afghan-Geiman relations^and this would seem likely to have as bad an effect on our.relations with Germany as would a direct protest. Moreover we are, to a certain/Minute Paper, Department. 4424 5000 1/36 weapons/ certain extent, committed 'by Lt.-Col. Fraser-Tytler’s unfortunate answer to an enquiry made of him by the German Minister in Kabul J in which he said that he did not think H. M. G. would raise any objection to the sale of arms in reasonable quantities by a Geman fim to the Afghan Government (Katodon 145 of 24th December. Our reply to this telegram is contained in Forminka No.18 of 20th February). f. In their telegram of 23rd April the Government of India draw attention to the fact that the transit of these arms through India would be noticed by the Soviet Government, and would be resented by them. It is perhaps doubtful whether we need be very tender of Russian susceptibilities^ as our diplomatic support appears to be more than ever necessary to them at the present moment and for this reason they are perhaps unlikely to stir up a storm over the grant of transit facilities through India. They are not signatories of the Treaty of Versailles and have no right to protest; indeed they might}fj)ace the Government of Indiaj grant transit facilities themselves in the event of our refusal^in order to curry favour with the Afghan Government. A further argument for allowing transit is that the breach of the Treaty of Versailles involved !is small compared with the other breaches recently committed by Germany and is unlikely to arouse much interest in Europe or Great Britain. 6. There are also practical arguments emphasised by the Government of India; that Afghanistan requires these arms and it is desirable from our point of view that she should I have them in order to increase her value as a buffer state and to enable her to extend control over her tribes. The Government of India could not supply the particularweapons purchased from Germany and even if H. M.G. or private firms in this country could supply them the new Afghan reserve fund could not 'bear the cost of giving the necessary credit facilities. Indeed if the Germans cannot supply these (ammunitions Russia would no doubt do so. Indeed the Afghans have for a long time been negotiating for the purchase of mountain guns from the Russians. It is, however, preferable from our point of view that these weapons should come from Germany because we c necessary, irfiosa control the supply of spare parts through India and Germany would be unlikely to reap political advantages embarrassing to us. Possibly, in allowing the Afghans to purchase munitions (as welljas factory equipment) on credit, the German Government have in mind the possibility that Afghanistan might be useful to them in the event of Russo-Geiman hostilities. It is, however, most unlikely that the Afghans would be so stupid as to run the risk of Russian aggression against them for the sake of Germany. Attention is also invited to the suggestion made by Lt.Col. Fraser-Tytler in Katodon 22 of 25 th February that he should remind the Afghan Government of the resolution of the League Council condemning Germany’s denunciation of the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and of Afghanistan’s obligation as a member of the League to support^ its attitude andiinform the Afghans of the embarrassment ' r en*AS\“ P 0 c vmich the ra-sks- ©£ transit facilities causes H.M.G. This suggestion was not pursued at the time j because we are not in a position to offer the Afghan Government their total requirements of 1914 pattern rifles and it seems in any case^ objectionable. Action on these lines would inevitably reach the ears of the German Government in a distorted shape and tne Afghans would suspect that our real objective was to encourage/4599 5000 2.3G Draft Paper.

Each party shall have the right of appointing a Military Attache to its Legation. Article 4. The Government of Afghanistan agrees to the establishment of British Consulates at Kandahar and Jalalabad, and the British Government agrees to the establishment of an Afghan Consul- General at the headquarters of the Government of India and three Afghan Consulates at Calcutta, Karachi and Bombay. In the event of the Afghan Government desiring at any time to appoint Consular officers, in any British territories other than India a separate agree ment shall be drawn up to provide for such appointments if they are approved by the British Government. Article 5. The two High Contracting Parties mutually guarantee the personal safety and honourable treatment each of the representa tives of the other, whether Minister, Consul-General or Consuls, within their own boundaries, and they agree that the said repre sentatives shall be subject in the discharge of their duties to the provisions set forth in the second schedule annexed to this treaty. The British Government further agrees that the Minister, Consul- General and Consuls of Afghanistan shall, within the territorial limits within which they are permitted to reside or to exercise their functions, notwithstanding the provisions of the said schedule, receive and enjoy any rights or privileges which are or may hereafter be granted to or enjoyed by the Minister, Consul-General or Consuls of any other Government in the countries in which the places of residence of the said Minister, Consul-General and Consuls of Afghanistan are fixed; and the Government of Afghanistan likewise agrees that the Minister and Consuls of Great Britain shall within the territorial limits within which they are permitted to reside or to exercise their functions, notwithstanding the provisions of the said schedule, receive and enjoy any rights or privileges which are or may hereafter be granted to or enjoyed by the Minister or Consuls of any other Government in the countries in which the places of residence of the said Minister and Consuls of Great Britain are fixed.

Similarly the Government of Afghanistan agrees that evei\ kind of goods, the export of which is not against the internal law of the Government of Afghanistan and which may in the judgment of the Government of Afghanistan be in excess of the internal needs and requirements of Afghanistan and is required by the British Government, can* be purchased and exported to India with the permission of the Government of Afghanistan. With regard to arms and munitions, the British Government agrees that as long as it is assured that the intentions of the Government of Afghanistan are friendly and that there is no immediate danger to India from such importation in Afghanistan, permission shall be given without let or hindrance for such importation. If, however, the Arms Traffic Convention is hereafter ratified by the Great Powers of the world and conies into force, the right of importation of arms and munitions bv the Afghan Government shall be subject to the proviso that the Afghan Government shall first have signed the Arms Traffic Convention, and that such importation shall only be made in accordance with the provisions of that Convention. Should the Arms Traffic Convention not be ratified or lapse, the Government of Afghanistan; subject to the foregoing assurance, can from time to time import into its own territory the arms and munitions mentioned above through the ports of the British Isles and British India. Article 7. No Customs duties shall be levied at British Indian ports on goods imported under the provisions of Article (i on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan, for immediate transport io Afghanistan, provided that a certificate signed by such Afghan authority or representative as may from time to time he determined by the two Governments shall be presented at the time .of importa tion to the Chief Customs Officer at the port of import setting forth that the goods in question are the property of the Government o' Afghanistan and are being sent under its orders to Afghanistan, and showing the description, number and value of the goods in respect of which exemption is claimed; provided, secondly, that (he goods are required for the public services of Afghanistan and not for the purposes of any State monopoly or State trade; and provided, thirdly, that the goods are, unless of a clearly dis tinguishable nature, transported through India in sealed packages, which shall not be opened or subdivided before their export from India. And also the British Government agrees to the grant in respect of all trade goods imported into India at British ports for re-exportr\ to Afghanistan and exported to Afghanistan by routes to be agreed upon between the two Governments of a rebate at the time and place of export of the full amount of Customs duty levied upon such goods, provided that such goods shall be transported through India in sealed packages which shall not be opened or subdivided before their export from India. And also the British Government declares that it has no present intention of levying Customs duty on goods or livestock of Afghan origin or manufacture, imported by land or by river into India or exported from Afghanistan to other countries of the world through India and the import of which into India is not prohibited by law. In the-event, however, of the British Government deciding in the future to levy Customs duties on goods and livestock imported into India by land or by river from neighbouring States, it will, if necessary, levy such duties on imports from Afghanistan; but in that event it agrees that it will not levy higher duties on imports from Afghanistan than those levied on imports from such neigh bouring States. Nothing in this Article shall prevent the levy on imports from Afghanistan of the present Khyber tolls and of octroi in any town of India in which octroi is or may be hereafter levied, provided that there shall be no enhancement over the present rate of the Khyber tolls. Article 8. The British Government agrees to the establishment of trade agents by the Afghan Government at Peshawar, Quetta and Parachinar, provided that the personnel and the property of the said agencies shall be subject to the operations of all British laws and orders and to the jurisdiction of British Courts; and that they shall not be recognised by the British authorities as having any official or special privileged position. Article 9. The trade goods coming to (imported to) Afghanistan under tin' provisions of Article 7 from Europe, &amp;c., can be opened at the railway terminuses at Jamrud, in the Kurram and at Chaman for packing and arranging to suit the capacity of baggage animals without this being the cause of reimposition of Customs duties; and the carrying out of this will be arranged by the trade representatives mentioned in Article 12 . Article 10. The two High Contracting Parties agree to afford facilities of every description for the exchange of postal matter between their two countries, provided that neither shall be authorised to establish Post Offices within the territory of the other. In order to give effect to this Article, a separate Postal Convention shall be concluded, for the preparation of which such number of special officers as the Afghan Government may appoint shall meet the officers of the British Government and consult with them.rf as ( o 8q ,'0T3 a a j a t a o f j t aibal tm $ t^aem^ueqsCE . sol^ i &gt;nl lot 9;rJB;r2 to v j d 5X ^XI'iqA X&gt;*s-S ,1 • t XiiqA JErcSS , o m 0 j 0X18 SOilODfl &gt;q : Xoq X/atcenea to a neilalA to eo texietf I bexuoea 4ae&lt;i eJ: - jBiaauH no so lebne e tlf,' 'is ’znjsErt t9- oo nsn nox^x'tX 3 X-b^j ennoo to (oil) xlq naiiw , ^ S6X t TcXiJli ;aQ£*0 xno i Ylqqi/9 olc iaioq ^ , i* 3no; :-■ en ne/irioO-oa jjjH ! e: b b.uoc nefluinaYOt) Js EyqS of \asn ieO o :t Xax'iatBxn naw tq XXl»ow oenl clsuo'Xil? noiXaitoq £onsii)6cxa to 8/ioi 'a*ie ixanoo nC »V.-1 ■^na tc noi tiBO tr E ©riv or basoqqo i j oineiafl • £ r aixlX to no^ 6 Article 11.

Appendix. h Letter from British Representative In Sardar-i-Ala, the Afghan Foreign Minister. (After compliments.) Wrm reference to the provisions contained in Article fi of the treaty concluded between the Government of Afghanistan and the British Government regarding the importation of arms and munitions into Afghanistan through India. I have the honour to inform and assure you that, although the British Government has in that article reserved to itself the right exercised by every nation to stop the transportation to a neighbouring country of arms and munitions, in the event of its not being assured of the friendly intentions of that country, the British Government has no desire to make trifling inci dents an excuse for the stoppage of such arms and munitions. It would only be in the event of the Government of Afghanistan showing plainly by its attitude that it had determined on an unfriendly and provocative course of policy towards Great Britain contrary to the neighbourly treaty above mentioned that the latter State would exercise the right of stoppage. There is every ground for hope that such a contingency will never arise, in view of the friendly relations which are expected to spring from the treaty which has'now been concluded.

As in Article 7 of the treaty (between) the two great Governments of Britain and Afghanistan, your Government has with great sincerity granted a discriminating exemption from Customs duties on the goods required by my Government and on the trade goods transported to Afghanistan through the ports of Great Britain and British India and has not imposed Customs on goods produced and manufactured in Afghanistan. 1 therefore also, in consideration of the friendship (between) the two Governments, write that mv Government will not give the opportunity of establishing a Consul- General or Consul or representatives of the Russian Government at the positions and territories of Jalalabad. Ghazni and Kandahar, which are contiguous to the frontiers of India. If the Consulates or representatives of the Government of Russia are allowed in the paits mentioned, the Government of Afghanistan shall not have the above- mentioned right of exemption.

He told me that Vickers had got into touch with Shah Mahmoud who had told them that he was visiting their works when he came to this country. He also said that Vickers could supply machine guns without difficulty and that, if there were difficulties about the supply of 3.7 howitzers, they could supply instead a 75 millimetre mounted gun which was really a superior product. (Initialled). L.C. 3rd April, 1956 .blit I understand that the alteration in the draft telegram to the Government of India regarding mountain guns, suggested by Mr. Collier after consultation with Colonel Israay, is not otriotly' aceura^ev The position is that the War Office are at present converting their stock of 3«7 howitzers into guns for use with horse artillery (apparently only an alteration of under-carriage is necessary to effect this change). 3.7 guns have never been manufactured by private firms, and probably if Vickers got an order for mountain guns from the Afghans they would supply a Spanish or Italian type. In saying that production will be largely engaged in expansion orders, the War Office may have had in mind the desirability from their own point of view of discouraging private firms taking on foreign orders at this moment. It is a point on which it is impossible to be dogmatic. I understand that Mr. Collier’s objection is to this particular passage of the draft, as ttrey/do not wish to tell foreign powers that they cannot obtain armaments from private firms in the United Kingdom, on account of our expansion programme. The above note is the result of discussion with Major CocJCram and Colonel Crofton of the War Office, and the amendments to the draft as shown in red ink have their concurrence. If you agree I might seekVMr. Collier’s agreement to them. ■^0^ \r^ V * to VCu'ou.V. cAoojCC v ^Northern Department Foreign Of iice.' ^ VajiSV' ^ O^waX dsA^j S#‘ ^^' 0 ‘ Colonel Kinsman did call here on February 20th, v/hen he was given the information available at that time (see N.940/593/97). The India Office were informed of this verbally. But he could now be asked to call again and recent developments explained to him as suggested by Mr. Rumbold. If, as seems likely, the reply to be given to the Afghan Minister about mountain guns is unfavourable, it would be desirable to be able at the same time to give a favourable reply about the 15,000 rifles. A decision on this point was being held up pending a settlement of the financial responsibility for expenditure on Afghanistan. I understand that the Treasury have now definitely accepted the Government of India’s proposal for an 'Equalisation Reserve' for this purpose, and it is to be hoped that the way is now clear for a rapid settlement of the rifles question - see India Office minutes in N. 1334/233/97 (P.Z. 773/36) - although the Government of India in their telegram No.624 (N.1400/593/97) apparently want the Afghans to accept our proposals about the 10,000 rifles before we offer them anything else. ? concur in both draft telegrams and ask Colonel Kinsman by telephone to call here. (Signed) B.A.B.BURROWS. 30/3. I agree with the above minute. In view of what Colonel Ismay tells me, however, the draft to Delhi might, I think, be amended as shown on it.As regards the machine, I should prefer not to state categorically to the Afghans that the Government of India cannot help them. It might choke them off altogether. (Intd.) L.C. March 50th. V vSECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Letter Telegram from Dated Bee.

In hia interview with Mr.Eden on 1st February Faiz Muhammad said that hia Government v/anted to purchase at least one battery of mountain guns as a sample of future consignments. On 4th February the Afghan Minister ° ^ was informed in reply that it was understood that the Afghan Government had already approached Messrs.Vickers, and H.M.G. were considering whether that firm could be j advised to aend a representative to Kabul to discuss the matter further. Ali Muhammad had not heard of these negotiations, and said he thought that Faiz Muhammad had supposed that H.M.G. had some surplus old pattern guns for sale. Further enquiries were promised. ^ u|v •» lxh/% |'i , X U : Ookc^uJt *( ^ 3 • 7 U^v 2. It now appears from the War Office letter of 37 Wo^ttTtc 20th March that one complete quarter-worn^battery could be shipped from the United Kingdom about June 1936 and sold for £1 Jl, 750 cash. This, however, may not be much use to the Afghan Government as the War Office say that the '/ possibility of any supply of 3.7 howitzers in bulk is slight, as existing stocks will not permit of it and 'X production will be largely engaged on expansion orders now envisaged. I understand that it is conceivable that the Government of India might be able to manufacture these 7 howitzers and perhaps it would be best.before replying to Ali Muhammad,to consult them. A draft telegram is suggested. 3. We have also had an enquiry from the Afghan Government regarding machine guns which has not been answered. On 6th July Shah Matmud told the Military Attache at Kabul that if he approved of a sample Vickers Berthier light automatic gun which the Government of India presented to the Afghans, he might buy 200, and asked whether the Government of India could supply this number. 3939 5000 7/35 The/■■■■■■■■■■ I The Government of India deal with the question with their usual dilatoriness in their letter of 19th February and explain that they are precluded under the terms of their existing arrangement with Messrs.Vickers from manufacturing these guns in their own ordnance factories except for use by their own troops. I understand that the Government of y &lt;\ India have recently sought from Messrs.Vickers^relaxation vOUCcVv COu.l&lt;i X*.

I also understand that the Vickers gun is not used in the British Army so the War Office will not be able to help. 4. The Government of India say that if it will be of any assistance to the Afghan Government they would be prepared to make the necessary arrangements with Messrs. Vickers for the supply of machine guns to the Afghan Government. We know, however, that an approach has been made on behalf of the Afghan Government to Messrs.Vickers direct in respect of machine guns, and it seems best if the Afghans continue to negotiate direct with Vickers, at any rate at this stage. For the Government of India to come in as an intermediary might encourage the Afghans to make an embarrassing request for credit facilities which, in view of the many contingent liabilities which it will be necessary to place upon the Afghan Reserve Fund in its early years, v/e probably could not give. A draft telegram to Kabul is suggested. 5. In Foreign Office letter of the 15th February to Vickers it was suggested that Colonel Kinsman should call at the Foreign Office.

The German Minister in Kabul is said to favour the larger figure on the ground that it will increase the value of German exports to Afghanistan.

Afghan purchase of arms from Germany, second paragraph. 2. General as opposed to local considerations are as follows:- Germany is forbidden by Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles to export arms, munitions and war material of every kind. German Government have announced that they do not intend to observe part of treaty to which this article belongs and it would no doubt be useless in practice to try to prevent export of war material from Germany, especially to countries like Afghanistan which are not parties to the treaty; but His Majesty's Government have never admitted that German Government were entitled to make above announcement, which has, in fact, formed the subject of a condemnatory resolution by League Council. 3. Anglo-Afghan Treaty of course imposes an obligation on the Government of India to allow transit of arms consigned to Afghan Government without questioning their origin. If the German deal went through, therefore, question of some difficulty might arise as to whether, because of that treaty, we should pass sub .silentio a breach of Germany 1 s obligation under Article 170 of Treaty of Versailles, to which India is a party. In these circumstances you should if possible avoid further discussion of the subject with your German colleague and should/2 . should in any case express no view on the probable attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards imports of arms from Germany into Afghanistan#SBU.gT, p.Z. 9283/35.

I understand that they might be ready to consider payment in instalments. Colonel Kinsman, late R.A., of Vickers, contemplates visiting Kabul in March or April to pursue the matter.

SECRET. KABUL : EXTRACT FROM INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY NO.6 FOR THE WEEK ENDING - 7TH FEBRUARY, 1936. The Army . 15 . purchase of Artillery . (a) M. Bonneau, Secretary of the French Legation, Kabul, stated (A) that the Afghan Government had on January 29th, concluded negotiations v/ith Messrs. Skoda for the purchase of mountain artillery. The artillery purchased is said to consist of 10 batteries of 4 guns each, complete in every respect with saddlery, telephone equipment etc. and 40,000 shells. The guns are 75 1928 Skoda model, with a range of 8,700 metres. The shells are 6.3 Kilos in weight (about 14 lbs.) and are to be supplied as follows:- 13&gt;350 shrapnel, 13*350 percussion cap with delayed action and 13*300 with double burst (7)- The basis of payment is not exactly known, but is probably one-third with the order, one-third against documents and one-third a year after receipt. Payment to be guaranteed by the Afghan National Bank. M. Bonneau also said that the Afghan Government had originally asked for 30 batteries in the hope of a reduction in price. Having obtained a quotation for the supply of 30 batteries they then reduced the order to 10 batteries. Messrs. Skoda did not raise the price, but used the reduced order as a lever to obtain early payment. He/2 He also stated that the Germans were keen competitors for the order&gt; hut Major Schenk, a German instructor at the Afghan Senior Officers’ School, rather gave away the business* It appears that the Italian guns in the Afghan Army have a compressed air recoil which depends on rubber buffers for good working* The Afghans were not aware of this, and the recoil did not work well. The guns which Messrs. Skoda are supplying have a spring recoil, which alone has a weight of 120 Kilos. The Afghans asked Major Schenk what sort of recoil the German guns would have, and he replied that they would have both. The Afghans then came to the conclusion that he was not advising them to the best of his ability, and was merely trying to sell them German guns. They therefore rejected the German tender, and accepted that of Messrs. Skoda. (b) Colonel Benedictov, the Russian Military Attache at Kabul, in the course of a conversation stated (A) that the Afghan Government had tried to obtain a gift of mountain guns from his Government, and when this att empt failed they asked for tenders for the supply of the guns with payments on a very extended instalment basis. He said that negotiations had broken down, and the Afghan Government had then turned to the Japanese, who . offered to supply obsolete guns very cheaply. He gave no indication as to whether he was aware that Messrs. Skoda had secured a contract for the supply of mountain guns.N&amp; THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed Vo set IV a’° of 0 iH'by the Secretary of State to enclose herewith a despatch for transmission A by the earliest opportunity to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul. 2. Should the Secretary of State for India have any observations which he thinks could be usefully embodied in this communication, it is requested that it may be returned immediately to this Department, with a note to that effect, in which case no further action would be taken here pending the receipt of the observations of the Secretary of State for India, to be communicated in accordance with the usual procedure. tsK'- ; EnCLOSUSr 1 ■, i 2MAR 1936 i ; CUVICAL AND ,193 4 DEPT.

Colonel Fraeer-Tytler has replied that the Afghan Government are anxious to obtain machine guns and mountain guns and that competition among armament firms is lively to be severe, the contract probably going to the firm offering longest credit. He adds that the Afghan ar minister is coming to Europe this month and that the negotiations for the supply of armaments may be ta, en up by him during hie visit.

Perhaps Colonel Kinsman might be told the whole story when he calls at the Foreign Office in pursuance of the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Foreign Office letter of 15th February, No.N.644/593/97. he might I perhaps also be told at the same time that the pursuit by the Afghans of the mountain gun question in London possibly throws sane doubt on the reliability of our information regarding Skodas having obtained a contract. 3.

IncidentallyIncidentally, it does not necessarily follow as the India Office seem to suppose that a refusal to allow the transit would constitute a breach of our treaty with Afghanistan, If we wished to refuse the ^ transit we could put up a very good legal argument to the effect that the latter treaty was never intended to oblige us to do something inconsistent v/ith Versailles, and indeed never contemplated the transit of German arms at all since the export of such arms was forbidden). ...

Sir, I am directed by Mr, Secretary Eden to state for the information of the Secretary of State for War that the Afghan Minister has requested an urgent reply to the enquiries on the subject of the supply of mountain guns to the Afghan j Government recorded in paragraph 3 of Mr. Eden's despatch No. 17 of February 5th to His Majesty's Minister at Kabul and further discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of his despatch No. 18 &gt;f February 11th to the same address. 2, It is understood, from an unofficial enquiry of your department, that a battery of four 3.7 howitzers is now being reconditioned and will be available for sale in about three months' time. This would appear to be exactly what is required by the Afghan Government as a sample; and I am therefore to request that you will be good enough to confirm the above information and to state whether, as far as your department are concerned, there would be any objection to the Afghan Minister being informed accordingly. I am further to enquire the approximate cost of this battery and whether it is likely that additional guns of a similar type would be available in the future if the Afghan Government repeated their order. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office, who have concurred in its terms. I am, etc., (Sd.) J.L. Dodds. The Under-Secretary of State, War Office.The Afghan Minister rang up today to say that Shah Wali, Afghan Minister at Paris, had asked for an urgent reply from us about the supply of mountain guns (see paragraph 5 of our despatch No. 17 and paragraphs 5 and 4 of No. 18 below). Colonel Toovey, has told me that there are four 3.7 howitzers being reconditioned v/hich v/ill be ready for disposal in three months. These are the mountain guns used in India and four constitute a battery. It looks therefore as though we might be able to meet the Afghan requirements as far as the sample battery is concerned (though there might not be more guns available on the same conditions if the order was repeated). Colonel Toovey could not tell me the price of the guns offhand but he could find it out without much delay. He would like to have an enquiry from us in writing before stating categorically that the guns would be available for sale to Afghanistan at a certain priceo I submit a draft, for India Office concurrence.

Sir, The Afghan Minister called at this department on February 4th to pursue further some of the questions discussed with me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (see my despatches Nos. 16 and 17 of the 5th February). 2. As regards the supply of arms to the Afghan Government, which was the first subject to be discussed, Mohammad Ali was told, in view of your telegram No.9 of the 31st January, uiiat you had resumed negotiations for the sale of the remaining 10,000 out of the first batch of 15,000 rifles but had telegraphed on February 1st that you were still without a reply to your proposals on that subject. As soon as this question had been settled, however, it would be possible to consider the supuly of another 15,000 rifles, making 30,000 in all. 3. As regards the supply of aeroplanes, the Minister was informed that His Majesty’s Government were already exploring this question, which, as I had pointed out, was particularly difficult, and would continue their investigations as quickly as possible to see what assistance, if any, could be afforded. As regards mountain guns, it was understood that the Afghan Government had already approached Messrs. Vickers, and His Majesty's Governnent were now considering whether that firm could be advised to send a representative to Kabul to discuss the matter further in the spring. 4.

As regards the mountain/ Lieut. -Col * W.K.Fraser-Tytler, C.M.G., M.C., etc., etc., etc., Kabul•2 . mountain guns, he had not heard of the negotiations with Messrs. Vickers and in any case he thought that Paiz Mohammad, when he spoke of these guns, had supposed that His Majesty’s Government had some surplus old-pattern guns for sale in the same way as they had rifles. He was informed that it was most unlikely that this was the case, hut that further enquiries would he made. 5. The Minister then said that he hoped Paiz Mohammad had made it quite clear that hoth in this matter and in that of a credit to the Afghan National Bank (see paragraph 7 of my despatch No.17), his Government were aporcaching His Majesty's Government for a continuation of the assistance which they had received since the days of King Amanullah and -^or which they felt themselves to he even more suitable recipients than were the Government of that monarch, and that what they hoped to hear from them wasthat they were ready in principle to give this sort of assistance. In the case of the credit to the National Bank, for example, if a direct Government credit to the London branch of the Bank (not an export credit to a British firm) could be granted in principle, they would not mind so much if it were only half the £500,000 for which they had asked, or even as low as £100,000, though, of course, the less it was, the fewer the goods which could be bought v/ith it. 6. Paiz Mohammad was told that the whole question of economic assistance to Afghanistan would be gone into as soon as possible but that at present it v/as uncertain what, if anything, could be done to meet his Government's wishes in such matters.

Sir, The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by the Afghan Minister in London, called on me again on February 1st to continue the conversation recorded in my despatch No.16 of February 5th. x xxx 3. Faiz Muhammad then said that, as he had told me on January 30th, he now wished to deal with some economic questions; and the first and most important of these was the question of the supply of arms to his Government, v/hich was both economic and political. When Sir Richard Maconachie was British Minister at Kabul, the Afghan Government had asked through him for 30,000 rifles for their army; and His Majesty’s Government had agreed last year to supply 15,000 rifles, 5,000 of which had now been received. The balance of 15,000 rifles was still urgently needed, however, and he asked me to use my influence to secure that these were supplied as soon as possible. His Government also wished to purchase twenty four aeroplanes, and at least one battery of mountain guns as a sample of future consignments. The Russians and others were offering them arms; but they were anxious to buy from this country if possible, and they recognized the force of the argument that they would be better able to resist a Russian attack if their arms and munitions were interchangeable with those used in India. Their army, however, must be built up quickly and could not wait indefinitely for the necessary equipment. 4. I replied that I would look into these matters as soon as possible and with every desire to help the Afghan Government. These requests, however, came at a time when we/ Lieut.-Col.W.K.Fraser-Tytler, CMG., MC., etc., etc., etc., Kabul. —own defences and when we were engaged in 'building up our we v/ere inundated with similar requests ^or help from other countries — particularly in the matter of aeroplanes* X understood moreover that it had 'been necessary for the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government to go very carefully into the incidence of the risk involved in the fact that the rifles already supplied were to 'be paid for hy instalments continuing over six years or so, not 'because they had not complete trust in t-ne Afghan Government 1 s determination to honour their obligations, 'but 'because these deferred payments always involved a risk of default through force mancure . x x x x 9 . Paiz Muhammad then took his leave with expressions of pleasure at his reception in London, 'but emphasising the urgency of a decision on his Government’s requests for arms.

I think that there can be no question of our addressing in any circumstances representations to the German Government on the basis of Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles. It is not practical to do so. The question is rather what obligation, if any, is incumbent on the Government of India as a signatory of the Versailles Treaty to prohibit the transit of German armaments through India to Afghanistan and whether the direct obligation of the Indian-Afghan Treaty of 1921 to allow transit of arms overrides any obligation arising under Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles. This is a legal question. On the practical side it may be recalled that we recently decided (on Western papers) that we could not interveneintervene with the Portuguese Government (itself a Versailles signatory) with a view to prevent a barter transaction by which Portuguese wheat was to be exchanged for German rifles. Though our responsibility in the case under consideration is no doubt more direct I do not think that we can, as a matter of practical politics, attempt to prevent the transit of these German arms across India if the deal goes through. I agree therefore with Mr. Walton's draft second paragraph which would, I suppose, follow on after the words in our original draft telegram ' would 'have to consider whether artillery could be allowed 'to proceed through India'. But as the Treaty position appears to be rather ticklish and we do not want to give anything away on paper, I should like the last sentence of Mr. Walton's draft to continue as in our original draft with the words 'and should in 'any case express no view on probable attitude of His 'Majesty's Government towards imports of arms from 'Germany into Afghanistan'. We must, I think, warn Colonel Fraser-Tytler that he must say nothing to commit us to an explicit condonation of any possible breach of the Versailles Treaty. (Sgd.) J. V. PEROWNE. February 6th, 1956. I agree with Mr. Perowne. (Intd) R.F.W. 6/2 If it is important not to prevent the transit of these arms, I think the position could be defended on thethe same lines as the conclusion of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The issues raised are very similar. * ^ Because in the German Naval case we could argue that our action did not facilitate a breach by Germany of the Naval clauses: she would have Mlt a fleet anyhow. Here it is quite possible that if transit through India were re rased the export could not be effected at all. The present case is, as a matter of fact, rather less favourable than the naval one*. On the other hand it is much less important, and should escape serious criticism - especially if we can show that a refusal would merely lead to the import of the arms via Russia or Persia. (Briefly the legal argument against allowing the transit would be that while the Treaty of Versailles does not in terms forbid such action, it does forbid it by implication - since to connive at and actively assist Germany in the breach of an obligation imposed upon her in common with the other signatories, in a common instrument, and in the common interest, would be a breach of faith towards them.) The argument contra , is that the effect of imposing an obligation on Germany by a common instrument cannot be different from that which would be produced if each ally had signed a separate treaty with Germany in the same terms - i.e. several peace treaties with Germany (an Anglo-German, Franco-German, Italo-German etc.) instead of one. If that had been done, each country could have released Germany separately from her obligations, and why should it be different because there was a common instrument? That was roughly the argument in the Naval case, and it could also be used here. (Personally I think the argument is unconvincing but that is beside the point.) (Sgd) G.G.Fitzmaurice 10 / 2 .

Despatch from 11 is Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 5, dated the 11th (received 15th) January 1936. As reported briefly in my telegram (Katodon 145) Dr. Zi'emke, the German Minister, called on me recently with the object of letting me know that the Afghan Government were in negotiation with a German armament firm for the pur chase of mountain artillery. 2. He said that his Government were anxious not to do anything in Afghanistan which might upset His Majesty’s Government and he would be glad to know what my views were on this subject. I said that speaking generally my Government had no objection to an increase in armaments by Afghanistan up to a limit of moderate efficiency. They still had a good long way to go before reaching that limit, and a purchase of up to date mountain artillery would be a better bargain for them than the field or heavy artillery I had heard rumours about. 3. Dr. Ziemke said he wondered what my Government would consider a reasonable quantity of mountain artillery for Afghanistan. So far as his information went their present artillery was completely out of date and useless. They had asked for a dozen batteries of four guns each, but he thought that four or five would probably be enough to start with. 4. I said we were dealing with a subject of which I had no technical know ledge and had never studied. Speaking quite informally and as a layman I should say that if the present Afghan artillery was really obsolete, their request for twelve batteries of mountain artillery could hardly be called excessive. I was rather doubtful however whether the Afghans could afford as many as that at present. 5. Dr. Ziemke agreed. He said the question of security in regard to Afghan purchases was a great problem. So far as his Government credits were con cerned he had so far experienced no difficulty. Payments had been prompt and full, and so long as the present Government lasted he believed they would conti nue to meet all their obligations. But while his Government might for a good object be prepared to risk a default, the case was different with a private firm. There was so far as he could see absolutely no commercial security in Afgha nistan and he felt obliged to advise this firm to proceed very warily in these present negotiations, which as a matter of fact had only just been initiated. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Berlin.

It is clearly desirable to obtain, if possible, a clear idea of Afghan intentions, and if the Afghan le-Cin^s KaWl Goo Foreign Minister is in fact coming Europe next month it will no doubt be much more convenient for Vickers to carry on their negotiations with him. It is suggested, therefore, that we should authorise Colonel Fraser-Tytler to discuss fhe question with the Afghan Prime Minister, and a draft telegram is submitted for approval. There seems no particular reason for linking up Vickers' negotiations with the German negotiations, so that the draft might issue without waiting for a decision upon mZ \^«rc H.M.G. * s obligations under the Treaty of Versailles, which is at present being discussed with the Foreign Office.

Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles prohibits in Germany the manufacture for* an? the export to* foreign countries of arms* munitions and war material of every kind. If this imposes an obligation on the Government of India to refuse transit facilities to Afghanistan i in respect of arms which the Afghan Government have i bought from Germany and which have been exported from that country* there is a conflict between this Article and the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921. This Treaty is quite explicit that transit must be allowed* irrespective of the origin of the aims: it is not even necessary under the Treaty for the Afghans to tell us the origin of the arms. Moreover* from the point of view of our relations with Afghanistan* quite apart from the treaty position* refusal of transit facilities would be most embarrassing* The Afghan Government could i justifiably quote at us the Anglo-German Ilaval Agreement* If* therefore* the 1 deal goes through I think that we should have to allow transit. It would be useful to remind Lieutenant-Colonel i Frascr-Tytler of the 'Versailles' position as set out in paragraph 1 of the Foreign Office redraft. I have, however, suggested a modification of paragraph 2 to make it clear that we would almost certainly not withhold transit. As Colonel Kinsman asked as long ago as 1st January that an enquiry should be made of Kabul regarding a visit which he hopes to undertake there* possibly in March, it is desirable that the third paragraph of this telegram at ;least should issue very soon.

On the other hand, to allow transit of arms exported from Germany would apparently only amount to I passing sub silentio a breach by Germany of an obligation resting on her* I suggest that after the second paragraph of the Foreign Office draft* which explains the Versailles position* it might continue as follows:- 'Anglo-Afghan Treaty of course imposes an obligation on the Government of India to allow transit of arms consigned to Af^ian Government without questioning their origin. If the German deal went through* however* question of some difficulty might arise as to whether we should pass sub sllentio a breach of Germany’s obligation under Article 170 of Treaty of Versailles In these circumstances you should if possible avoid further discussion of the subject with your German colleague*' If the case arose* and if it were decided not to ignore it* any representati ms which H.M.G, might make would presumably be addressed to the German Government and not to the Government of Afghanistan* which of course is totally unconcerned in the Versailles obligation.

(.The regular procedure for dealing with the application for the export of arms to Afghanistan is laid down in Art. 6 of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1 ^ 1921, and in Letters 2 attached to that Treaty. Provided that the friendly intentions of the Afghan Government are assured and that the British Minister in Kabul has been supplied in the first instance by the Afghan Government with the usual information as to method of shipment, date or arrival at Karachi and number and marking of canes, His Majesty's Government are in the ordinary way and ‘'for all ^practical purposes' 1 bound by treaty to allow the Afghan Government to import without let or hindrance whatever arms it desires (please see para. 2 of Foreign Office memorandum P.2477/29, flagged). In paragraph 13 of this memorandum it is further stated that in dealing with the Afghan Government it is necessary that His Majesty's Government and the Government of India act together not only in fact but in appearance, and that where the issue of a licence for the export of arms from this country has once been granted, permission for their transit across Indian territory should not be withheld^&lt; ^VVVA. 0/3 ^ it is of course desirable that His Majesty's Government should not seem to wish to in any way with the Afghan Government's liberty to purchase arms as it pleases, since any intervention on our part might be regarded either as a reflection on Afghanistan's intentions or as of itself an unfriendly act. For this reason His Majesty's Government have in the pastmmmmm mmm always been careful to avoid raising objections in this direction^ on several occasions it has appeared^when a proposed purchase of arms by the Afghans from a German source had been reported^that a breach of Art. 170 of the Treaty of Versailles Thus, in addition to the instances set out at P.Z.486/34, there was in 1928 a project for the import into Afghanistan through India of rifles that kadvba^n purchased from a German firm. It proved however on this occasion that the rifles were of British make and the Foreign Office took the view that no breach of the Treaty of Versailles was involved, provided the arms were not brought into German territory at any V period of the transaction (P.4152/28); subsequently, moreover, this project was abandoned. Until the present enquiry from the German Minister at Kabul regarding the possible purchase of 12 batteries of mountain guns by the Afghan Government from a German firm, it has never been clearly established that a sale of arms or munitions GA ccpAA* (vtrU\. bCtvvA manufactured in^ aaMtw^O'fc^merely exported in transit from Germany was involved. In consequence, the Government of India has hitherto had no occasion to refuse transit through India for arms, munitions, etc, on the grounds that they were 1 exported from 1 Germanyto P 6 . In 1929, during the civil war in Afghanistan, transit was refused by the Government of India a consignment of French machine guns through India on a technical provision in the Anglo—Afghan Treaty of 1921, i.e. the non-fulfil/ment of the conditions specified in letter No.2 attached to the Treaty.

X VC^ 1 ' Goyernment then decided, not without some hesitation, to confirm this ruling £ please see P.Z.&lt;^58/29j If the present deal with the German firm should ever lead to a transaction - and it is known that the Afghan Government have been in negotiation also with the Japanese and the Russians as well as with Vickers and if the Government of India wished, as signatories to the Versailles Treaty, to refuse transit through c) ^Hr \&gt;o SS'^U 5&gt;ro ^ Vjt O^cv 8^ iV'K'd*. India to this artillery, it is clear that they would have to take their stand on a somewhat broader ground than that adopted in 1929. -2.1 i .3 b. Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles prohibits in Germany the manufacture for, and the export to, foreign countries of arms, munitions and war material of every kind. If this imposes an obligation on the Government of India to refuse transit facilities to ifUfi. QlO0'“ Afghanistan in respect of arms which they^have bought from Germany and which have been exported from that country, there is a conflict between this Article and the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921. This Treaty is quite explicit that transit must be allowed irrespective of the origin of the arms: it is not even necessary for the Afghans to tell us the origin of the arms. Moreover, from the point of view of our relations with Afghanistan, quite apart from the treaty position, refusal of transit facilities would be most embarrassing. The Afghan Government could justifiably quote at us the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. If, 3939 5000 7/35 therefore/ 3939 5000 7/35therefore, the deal goes through I think that we should have to allow transit. It would he useful to remind Lieutenant-Colonel “ MVsgAUs Fraser-Tytler of the 'treaty position as set out in paragraph 1 of the Foreign Office tlraft. I have, however, suggested a modification of paragraph £ to make it clear that we would almost certainly not withhold transit. As Colonel Kinsman asked as long ago as 1st January that an enquiry should be made of Kabul regarding a visit which he hopes to undertake there, possibly in March, it is desirable that the third paragraph of this telegram at least should issue very soon. VN*v Art. 170 of the Treaty of Versailles imposes a specific obligation on Germany bat not, surely, on this country or India or other signatories of that treaty. On the other hand, Art. 6 of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921, .9 and Letters I and II attached to that treaty, do impose a specific obligation on H.M.G. and the G. of I. to permit transit of arms consigned to the Afghan Govt, through India, and this obligation is not limited by any condition as to the origin of the arms. We there cannot, without a breach of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty, decline to allow arms to transit India for Afghanistan merely on the ground that they were exported from Germany. On the other hand, ’to allow transit of arms exported from Germany would apparently only amount to passing sub silentio a breach by Germany of an obligation resting on her. I suggest that after the second para, of tne ,J .0. draft, which explains the Versailles position, it mi edit continue as follows:- ”Anglo-Afghan Treaty of course imposes an obligation on the G. of I. to allow transit of arms consigned to Afghan Govt, without questioning their origin If the German deal went through, question of some difficulty might arise as to whether we should pass sub silentio/Minute Paper. Department. a breach of Germany’s obligation onder Art. 170 of Treaty of Versailles. In these circamstances you should if possible avoid farther discussion of the subject with your German colleague.' If the case arose, and if it were decided not to ignore it, any representations which h.M.G. might make would presumably be addressed to the German Govt, and not to the Govt, of Afghanistan, which of course is totally unconcerned in the Versailles obligation. h- Dept -, Foreif-n Office. '' /rv A ^ ? &lt; j t29S /^ r Colonel Kinsman called here a few days ago to say that he might he going to Kabul on behalf of Vickers, and to ask for some information about the journey to Kabul, which I was able to give him. I did not record the conversation at the time as Colonel Kinsman said that « he would very shortly v/rite to us officially, when his plans were more definite. He has not yet done so. He seemed a little doubtful whether the Afghans would like to do business with a British officer (even a retired one). It is just possible that they might be afraid of propaganda to the effect that they were associating too closely with the British army etc. and it ma\ r be worth asking Colonel Fraser-Tytler more explicitly for his opinion on this point.

It is one thing to decide that we cannot at this hour of the day dp anything to enforce the observance of Article 170 on the German Government: it is quite another to tell the representative of the German Government that we' ”would not raise any objection to a ’’sale in reasonable quantities” - though I suppose Colonel Fraser Tytler was thinking of local not ”Versailles” considerations. The Afghan Government of course are not signatories of the Versailles Treaty, so that they cannot be called to account for buying arms from: Germany. I ibink it would be better (if this is possible from the/the 'local” point of view) were Major Fraser-T ‘tier to he instructed to decline to he drawn into expressions of opinion as regards the exrjort of arms from Germany to Afghanistan at any rate so long as the rrr’esent anomalous position exists. (Signed) J.Y. PFROY/NE 15/1 I agree with above, provided it is satisfactory to India Office - otherwise we can no doubt get an agreed draft in some other form. The important thing is from the Versailles point of view that we should not in any way seem to have approved the consignment - hut I don’t know how this affects the question of transit across India. If the packages have to he declared at the Indian port of transshipment as containing German machine guns, are the Government of India, as a party to the Treaty of Versailles, to allow them to proceed? I fear this point will have to he considered. We don’t want to make difficulties: hut the point is a tricky one and, before sending any instructions, I am afraid we must get it clear.

A .^0 aj k-v/. i'ej'tljur O'* e, 'fj° r , i*t ft. oij e ,\-. Early in 1935 the Afghan Government opened negotiations with the Soviet Government for the sale of mountain guns. There was prolonged haggling over terms hut in August 1935 the Afghans announced in the Islak that the deal had been completed. It is, however, uncertain whether this is so. It now appears from from Katodon 145 of £4th December that the Afghan Government have opened negotiations with a German firm for the purchase of twelve batteries of mountain guns. We have also been informed by Colonel G.R.V. Kinsman, C.M.G., D.S.O., of Messrs. Vickers, that an approach has been made to his firm on behalf of the Afghan Government for the sale of mountain guns and machine guns. It therefore seems probable that the negotiations with the Russians have not been completed (because the Afghans would presumably want all their mountain guns to be of one type), and that the Afghan Government are either trying to get bids from the Germans and from tie l/', iLbgh^firs in order to improve their bargaining position with the Russians, or because they are less anxious to from Russia than they were before. Their original idea was to tuymountain guns from the Russians in order to prevent them oecoming jealous on account of the Afghan purchases of rifles and ammunition from H.M.G. In May 1935, Vickers applied for a licence to export sixteen field guns and fifty machine guns for which they had been invited to tender by the Afghan Government (P.Z.3857/35). Nothing has yet come of this. Vickers are, however, anxious to get the contract for mountain guns and machine guns. Colonel Kinsman was advised that the Afghans would press to be allowed topay for these articles in instalments and that Vickers should deal direct with the Afghan Government. He VCCVCK5 indicated that we/might agree to instalments and suggested that he should go to Kabul himself in March or April to pursue the question. He was told that this would certainly improve his chances but that we would obtain Lieutenant-Colonel Fraser-Tytler 1 s advice regarding it. It is good that Vickers are taking an interest in the matter because it is on the whole desirable that the Afghans should get their armaments from Great Britain. As regards the enquiry of the German Minister at Kabul whether H.M.G. had any objection to the sale by a German firm of mountain guns to the Afghans, such a transaction would be a clear breach of Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles. In previous cases of the purchase by the Afghans of arms from^ Germany, H*M.G. have not raised objections because it was not clear that breaches of the Treaty were involved and it was undesirable, from the point of view of our relations v/ith Afghanistan, to intervene (please see the Minutes at P.z.486/34). Presumably, in view of the fact that the armament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles have been allowed to fall into desuetude, although not abolished by agreement, the Foreign Office will not desire to instruct Lieutenant- Colonel Fraser-Tytler to discuss the matter further with the German Minister or revise the opinion he has already expressed, which., from the point of view of our relations with Afghanistan, seems entirely suitable. It is preferable that the Afghans should get their mountain guns from the Germans, who have no political interests in | Afghanistan, than from the Russians, although, of course, it would be best of all for Vickers to get the order. A draft telegram to Kabul, drafted on this assumption, is put up. /U m- f t.3938 5000 7.35 P.S.9P83/35. Draft Paper. political Department. ForminAa Peshawar Copy to Foreign Office. D.M.I.

Draft memorandum to the Board of Trade concurring in the issue of a licence (to issue without concurrence Draft telegram to H.M.Minister, Kabul (to be referred to Foreign Office for concurrence). n/ b/y Q-ouvO ■ ta Previous Papers 1140 1000 8.32Minute Paper, political Department Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs have 'been asked by the Afghan Government to tender for sixteen 75mm. field guns and 50 machine guns, the total value of which is estimated at £100,000. This is the first request which we have had for an export licence under the revised procedure which was adopted early in 1934. It is the essence of this procedure that the licence should be granted when information is received that a foreign Government is in the market for a specific transaction and before any orders are actually placed. 2. It seems therefore desirable, while agreeing to the grant of the present application, that we should take steps to ensure that Messrs.Vickers Armstrongs inform us whether in fact their tender is successful, and^if it is we might subsequently ask them to advise us of the arrangements for the shipment of the order. This |information will enable us to spur the Afghan Government if necessary^into adherence to the procedure laid down in Article 6 of the Afghan Treaty of 1921 and letter No.2 3. It might be well to inform Colonel Praser- Tytler by telegraph of the request of the Afghan Government for tenders, and a draft telegram is suggested * which might be referred to the Foreign Office for concurrence. It seems unnecessary to refer to the Foreign Office the draft which is also suggested to the annexed thereto. Board of Trade, as the Foreign Office have already concurred in the issue of a licence.

P.Z.486/34. political Department. The reference in Katodon 11 of 19th Januaiy to Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles has caused the Foreign Office to examine the position and to conclude that, if it were established that the arms which the alleged German firm have offered to the Afghan Govt, were indeed manufactured in Germany, there would be ground for complaint to the German Govt. Our information, however, is insufficient to shew:- (1) whether the German firm mentioned by the Afghan M.F.A. exists at all, and, if it does, what its name is. (2) whether the munitions mentioned in Katodon 2 (3.A.A*» Colt, Vickers and Lewis Guns) are manufactured In, or to be exported from, Germany. (3) whence the German firm obtained the arms. This question has however been considered before |on more than oneoccasion. In 1929 during the Bacha-i- 3aqao regime (see Foreign Office despatch to Berlin No.644 dated 27th May 1929, N.2462/42/97) there was a transaction in arms reported by the Polish authorities. It was decided that there was insufficient material for a protest by H.M.G. and that the Polish Government mlgjjt be left to complain if they thought themselves on sufficiently strong ground. Again, in 1931, there was a purchase by Amanullah 'in Germany' which, on investigation, proved to have taken place in Poland, the German Govt, having merely warehoused the rifles and supplied the funds for the purchase out of the credit of M.6,000,000 granted to the ex-King. (see Foreign Office letter N.4298/299/97 ol 2nd July 1931 and Kabul despatch No.150 dated 6th November 1931).■■■■I mmm 2 . iiiven last year there was a small consignment ot rifles, pistols, shot guns and cartridges (see P.Z.7332/33, 7967/33 and P,2.24/84) wblcd was allowed to go through Karachi, after examination, in advance of the Afghan formal request for transit facilities. From the point of view of Anglo-Afghan relations it is not only contrary to our interest to place obstacles in the way of the Afghan Govt, buying their material in any quarter they wish,* but would also be at variance with the spirit, if not the letter, of the Treaty of 1921 (Article 6), It is submitted therefore that we make no effort to investigate this hypothetical transaction, and, in reply to H.ta.Minister • which we shall do when I.C.I. have made up their minds as to the answer they wish sent - simply say, that the Treaty provision quoted would certainly apply if it were established that the arms were manufactured in Germany, but we have no evidence of this and oo not, at the present stage, consider that any useful purpose would be served by seeking evidence with a view to taking up the point with the German Govt. We might, a£ suggested, copy the correspondence to the War Office, in case they may care to make discreet enquiries for their own satisfaction through trie Military Attache in Berlin or otherwise; perhaps Foreign Office would also like to send copies to H.L.Ambassador, Berlin. (Sd.) E.P. DONALDSON. 1.11.34. I agree. There was some years ago another case, I think, on which the whole question was exhaustively considered. From the Anglo-Afghan aspect the main point is that it would surely damage our relations, if as a result of * because they would legitimately resent such action as unfriendly.

They had not been purchased in Germany at all, but in Poland, by Ohulam Siddiq, against the credit of six million marks granted by the German Government to 4manullah Fhan. The price, as stated by Ghulam Siddiq, had been £30,000. The latter had, on the outbreak of the recent revolution in this country, asked the German Government to warehouse the rifles, as an act of courtesy, until conditions allowed of their despatch to Afghanistan; and this the German Government, who were in no way concerned in the transaction beyond supplying the funds for it, had consented to do. 3.

Mr. Henderson does not of course wish to suggest that remonstrances should be addressed to the Afghan Government for buying war material in Germany nor that the consignment in question should be stopped, since it has presumably by this time reached its destination. He would be grateful, however, if it were possible discreetly to ascertain from what German firm the purchase was made, in order that the matter may, if necessary, be taken up with the German Government. It is of course possible that the phrase ’’purchased in Germany” may be inaccurate and that these munitions have been as in other instances The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.^ instances, acquired in Czechoslovakia and transhipped at Hamhurg. 5.

It includes correspondence between Afghan Officials -- the Foreign Minister, the Legations to Paris and London, and the Consulate of Afghanistan in India -- and British Officials, including the India Office Political Department, HM Minister Kabul (Richard Maconachie), the Foreign Office, the War Office, and HM Ambassador to Berlin (Neville Henderson).The file opens with correspondence regarding the alleged purchase in 1931 of arms from Germany, in violation of Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles. It is determined that the arms in question originated in Poland, with funding from the German Government. Later correspondence documents the British decision not to protest against such treaty violations, in light of the obligation on Britain to not interfere with the supply of arms to Afghanistan as agreed in the Anglo-Afghan Treaty (1921).Arrangements for the purchase, licensing and transport of arms to Afghanistan from Czechoslovakia, Germany, Japan, Spain, the USA, France and Belgium are documented in the file. The principal firms involved in these arrangements are: Škoda Works; Rheinmetall-Borsig AG; Dynamit-Actien-Gesellschaft (vormals Alfred Nobel); and Messrs Vickers-Armstrongs Limited. A number of additional firms are mentioned but not named. The file also contains communications received from the Government of India Central Board of Revenue and the Collector of Customs at Karachi, reporting on the arrival and examination of shipments, the validity of export licences, and the payment of customs dues.The file includes dividers which give lists of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
