IMPORTANT h&lt; Your telegram No.352 February 10th. Following is a summary of information received from H.M.Minister Jedda. U.S.Minister Jedda informed H.M.Minister at the end of January that he had communicated to Saudi Arabian Government intention of C.A.S.O.C. to construct gigantic refinery at DHARAN with a capacity of 50,000 barrels per diem. It was expected that the plant would be operating within 24 months. H.M.Minister reported indications that Saudi Arabian Government wish to exact large Royal British interests from the Company or a greater participation in the exploration of fields more or less on the same ^concession that Iraq Government enjoy in respect of Iraqi fields. Subsequently Saudi Arabian Government informed H.M.Minister that C.A.S.O.C. proposed also to construct an oil line from DHARAN to a point on the Mediterranean oil line to be the property of the U.S. Government. Apparently latter made announce ment covering their intentions before communicating them to the Saudi Arabian Government. This action created a bad impression locally and accentuated S.A.G’s intention to resist any political control or interference by the U.S.Government in Saudi Arabian affairs. 2.

Ibn Saud agreed. (b) permission to construct a pipe line from Ras Tanura to Bahrain pending construction of new refinery at Dahran. Ibn Saud agreed provided (1) it raised no question of Bahrain-Saudi frontier and (2) did not affect Saudi interests adversely. He requested (gr.mut) even with a letter to this effect. (c) they informed Ibn Saud that USA Government wished to construct a pipe line from Dahran to the Mediterranean but they had no informa tion of route to be followed nor whether so far would be undertaken by USA Government,or the Company. Ibn Saud replied that the construction of this line would appear to be in best interest of S.A.G. but that he must withhold the Company *s finality of the scheme until he had been supplied with full details.3 2.

I advised Nuri Pasha to etep carefully, reminding him that only last September the united States Government had indicated that it would not ^ be convenient to receive His Royal Hi^iness . V/hile their attitude today might be different, he ought not to risfc a possible rebuff. His Sxcellency frankly told me that both the Regent and he think that such a visit in the fairly near future would be useful in perhaps counteracting to some extent the growing and largely unanswered Zionist propaganda in America. v .r* t - 3. The oil question is another though lesser pre occupation. The Prime Minister said today that the lUlted States Minister, had, at his request, agreed to find out exactly what American intentions are over the development of the Kuwait and other southern Helds. There has been publicity here recently about a pipe-line from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean and from vhat Nuri Pasha said I gather he fears that as American companies only have a 23interest in the Iraq petroleum Company they may not be greatJy concerned in cooperating in the exploitation of Iraq’s resources. He does not apparently regard the proposed increase in the capacity of the Klrkuk- H&amp;lfa pipe-line as anything more than a beginning, and evidently desires an assurance that the united States’ plans lately announced will not react adversely upon this country • 4.

According , to the “ New York Times ” the Petroleum Reserve Corporation (a U.S. Government organisation formed only last year) has re cently been attempting to buy a 40 per cent interest from U.S. oil companies of their concessions in Saudi-Arabia, JjLli^oit and Bahrein. At present tne Anglo- Iranian Oil Company (British) and the Gulf Oil Corporation (American) have each 50 per cent interest in th e Kuwait con cession . The “ New Jork Times adds ’That there are tentative j plans for the construction of , rehneries at Haifa and Alexan- -rtria with a combined' capacity of 300,000 barrels (about 80,000 tons) daily. The Alexandria re finery would be served with crude oil by a pipe-line, 1,500 miles long, starting at Qatar, in Saudi-Arabia, as a ^A-inch line and being joined at Damman by a 16-inch line from the Kuwait area.

Presume you will see no objection to visas for Kuwait being granted to non British members of mission referred to in paragraph 1 without individual reference to you.CONFID ”VTT \L Telegram Kuiv iL No l “ *- 1 _ s From Prior, Shiraz.

The Director of Naval Intelligence. M m o psfiftY BR, M 7P SERVER. BASRA . In the course of this year I have gleaned the information from my own observation, and from conversations with Consular and other authorities, that the United States is showing a marked interest in trade developments in the Persian Gulf area. 2. The development of oil projects, some of which are shared with Britain and other countries, is, of course, as legitimate as it is obvious. I gather that their enquiries ara not confined to oil, but in any case such purely trade and commercial activities are matters for Consular and Political authorities in which the Navy is hut indirectly concerned. 3. If, however, it should appear that U.S.Naval authorities are interesting themselves in essentially commercial inquiries, I deem it desirable that this should be known. And in this connect ion a brief review of the U.S.Naval set-up in the Persian Gulf is relevant. 4. The following appointments are now helds- Basra U.S.Naval Observer. Coast Guard. Lieut. Com. USNR. 2 Assistant Officers. 1 Commander. Khorramshahr U.S.N.O. Staff. Coast Guard Staff 1 Officer. 2 Officers. Abadan 1 Officer. Inspector of Material. Bahrain 8&amp;&amp;.N.0. Staff. Inspector of Material 1 Officer. 2 Officers. During the past six months the number of officers has gradually been built up to that shown above. 6. In March 1944 Commander W.N.Benkhart, USNR, was appointed to the post of U.S.Naval Observer, in which he was releived by Lieutenant Commander C.E.Perry, USNR. on about 12 August, 1944 - Commander Benkhart then proceeding to an appointement in Calcutta._ I _ - 2 - U.S.NAVAL OBSERVER, BASRA. (Persian Gulf letter No.lS49/?,G.0657 dated 27th September, 1944). 4 J - guard ss u The directif of the U.S.Naval Observer is not known to me, nor have I asked for this. The Fork naturally involves keep- wlth , u « 3 * shipping matters, (no doubt in co- operatron with the War Shipping Administration5, and supervising the discipline and wellbeing of the Armed Guards in U.S. Merchant snips, as well as the technical upkeep of defensive armament, ine wellbeing etc. of merchant seamen is the duty of the Coast Guard Ofileers who however in cases of necessity refer to the rmval Observer. The Naval Observer is also believed to supervise the work of the Inspectors of .Material whose duty at Abadan seems to be closely concerned with that carried out by our inspector of Admiralty Fuel. 7. That I have been impressed with other activities of the Naval Observer which extend to inquiries regarding trade activities faci'lities n, entraRce the Persian Gulf, and to port It js significant that both Commander Benkhart and Lieut enant Commander Perry are members of the U.S.Naval Intelligence Neither are active service officers; both are alert and intelligent, Lieutenant Commander Perry being a business man who ^ P ?? Cet i' rne r, haS serve 2 f0llT y*ars in India, one year in Ceylon ana live In Burma. Before relieving Commander Benkhart he served for some months as Naval Observer in Durban. 9. Commander Benkhart, of Prussian descent, had a consider- able part in the intelligence work leading up to the attack on Casablanca; he proved to be a most co-operative and friendly colleague at Basra, and seemed to be perfectly frank and open in nis dealings with me. During his appointment at Basra he visited Bahrain, Bushire and Kuwait, and accompanied me in H.M.S.'Beacon' 0R a , vl ® it to Bandar Shahpur. He evinced a dfcsire to visit Muscat which, however, he did not achieve. 10. Lieutenant Commander Perry is the more •aggressive* type of American, both in manner and inquisitiveness. He has evinced'an interest in Jask and Bandar Abbas; he has asked for Information regarding the port facilities at Basra regarding which he referred to the Port Directorate. He has inquired about the Caspian ports regarding which I recommended him to apply to the U.S.Commanding Geneial, Persian oulf Command, at Tehran in whose province such matters are. _ Recently, at his instigation, the Resident Inspector of Naval Material U.S.N., Abadai^/as shown in enclosure No.l. Since such information would have meant an infinity of additional work for the Naval Control Service Officer, even if he was in a position to supply it, and since it seemed to be essentially con cerned with trade as opposed to Naval matters, I discussed the aa^er with Lieutenant Commander Perry frankly and friendily. He said the instructions prompting the inquiries were from the Navy Department, Washington, and he said he thought the Department was not wholly appreciative of the set-up in the Persian Gulf and in of the inquiries was not quite clear.' ihe object of the inquiries regarding American (and this includes Panamanian) ships was to enable full facts to be available retard- / addressed certain inquiries to the Naval Control Service Officer, Abadan /That being so- 3 - ycf i9i - wm - U.S.NAVAL OBSERVER, BASRA. (Persian Gulf letter No.1649/P.G. 0657 dated 27 September, 1944). That being so, I told him that it v/as not clear how British and other ships were of concern to him. with which he agreed. I then told him X would endeavour to obtain the necessary information regarding IJ.S. and Panamanian ships, though here it may be inter posed that my office keeps him supplied with all signals affecting movements of U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf. 12. I know little of the activities £f the U.S.Naval officers at other ports in the Persian Gulf, but the Political Agent, Bah- / rain has expressed the view that there seems to be an unusual number of U.S.Naval Officers stationed there compared with the amount of 'Naval* interests involved. 13. In conclusion, lest it might be thought that I have any , phobist’ views regarding our .American Ally, I am happy to know that my relations with TJ.S.Naval personnel in the Persian Gulf have been as cordial as were those which I experienced at Oran and in the Western Mediterranean.

Some confusion may arise over the fact that certain vessels discharge part of their cargo at Abadan, proceed to Khorraroshahr for further discharge, and then return to Abadan. For this reason it would probably be desirable for names of all ships to be inxluded in the figures. CoIllster Johnson. Lt.

Extract from New Fork Times dated 9th December, 1944, AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT REGARDING OIL.E&amp;O 8667/44 BY FAST AIR MAIL 2 9th December, 1944 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to refer to correspondence regarding the Agreement with the United States Government regarding Oil, resting with India Office letter No. E &amp; 0. 7379/44 of 24th October. There have since been the following further developments. 2. The President of the United States, shortly after the signature of the Agreement, decided to submit the text (but not the agreed statement) to the Senate for ratification as a Treaty. This procedure involves (a) reference to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, (b) a report back to the Senate by the Committee with appropriate recommendations and (c) a debate and vote on the Treaty by the Senate under the two-thirds majority rule. In November, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to delay until the meeting of the new Congress con sideration of all major Treaties pending, and it appeared that the Oi}. Agreement would, therefore, come before the Committee next month. 3. Meanwhile, however, Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Committee, issued a statement to the Press on December 2nd expressing the opinion that the Agreement would never be ratified by Jcxtea the Committee and that in his view the Agreement was not necessary for the general welfare and was unfair to the American Oil Industry. 4. In explanation of Press reports that the State Department were preparing a revised Agreement for sub mission to the United Kingdom Government, H.M.Ambassador, Washington, state-s that the Oil Policy Committee of the Petroleum Industry War Council ( a body representative only of the United States industry) have prepared a revision of the Agreement which was overwhelmingly approved by the Council and has now been formally sub mitted to the United States authorities. A large factor in the industry^ opposition to the Agreement appears to be the feeling that the latter is an attempt on the part of the United States Administration to obtain control r££x of the domestic Industry. 6. H.M.Ambassador states that the United States autho rities will now examine the revised document prepared by the United States Oil industry and will probably endeavour to strike a compromise between the present Agreement and this revision. While it is impossible to forecast pre cisely the future procedure, he thinks that the president may withdraw the existing Agreement from the Senate Committee and that, if and when a compromise document approved by the United States authorities Is prepared, the President may take the decision to handle the matter henceforth by executive action. The position may become clearer in the next two or three weeks. 6. A copy is enclosed of telegram from Washington,No.6570 of the 9th December, giving the text of the letter from the Chairman of the Oil Policy Committee to the Petroleum Industry War Council, and of the revised Agreement as approved by that Council and submitted to the United States authorities.

Earl of Halifax No. 6570 9th December, 1944. Received 10th December,1944. IMMEDIATE . My immediately procedinp telegram. following is text of (A) covering letter of December 5th from chairman of Oil Policy Committee to Petroleum Industry War Council. ( You will recollect that Oil Policy Committee is special committee of Petroleum Industry War Council formed to consider this and kindred matters on behalf of the P.I.W.C.) (B) agreement revised in accordance with proposals of P.I.W.C. and endorsed by that body as well as by the American Petroleum institute itself. 2) (A) To Petroleum Industry War Council. In response to the instructions received from the Petroleum Industry W a r Council, the National Oil Policy Committee has attempted to draft modifications of the Anglo-American oil agreement to meet the objections that have been raised- The Committee endeavoured to carry on its deliberations within the framework established by the Council and by the Petroleum Administrator’s letter of October 24th 1944 to W.R. Boyd jr. chairman of Petroleum Industry War Council reading. ”1 understand that the Petroleum Industry War Council and certain of its committess desire to register objection to the recently negotiated Anglo- American agreement. If the Council or any of its committees do so desire to record with me such views on the subject I request that at the same time as thev make known their objections they likewise make known in specific language exactly how, in their view, the existing docu ment might be revised so as to remove the points of objection cited, this in the interest of the creative a nd helpful approach as opposed to a purely destructive one' pursuant to the request contained in tihe above letter the Petroleum Industry War Council at its meeting of October 25th, 1944. adopted the following resolution. Dr. Wilson moved that the National Oil Policy Committee be instructed to continue its study of Anglo- American oil agreement and mnke an effort to suggest to the Council at its next meeting revisions in specific language that existing objections to the document would be removed, that in doing so the committee give full consideration to the (grp. omitted) cited In the resolution presented as a minority report of the Committee as well as all other criticisms and objection which may come to the attention of the Committee during the course of the study.' It is important to keep in mind that the Committee's work was on an agreement which had been signed and submitted to the Senate 6or ratification and that the Petroleum Industry War Council was requested to comment upon this agreement and to Braake known in specific language exactly how in their view the existing document might be1 1 -2- revised. M The Council was not requested to prepare an entirely new document, consequently the National Oil Policy Committee has laboured to draft modifications of this agreement to meet the numerous objections to it. It muat also be recoenised that the suprested agreement covers many and varied problems and that compromises were required. Many of the changes represent the unani- mouse opinion of the Committee, but in some instances they are the weight of the Committee^ opinion. In reviewing the agreement the Committee had before it not only the objections raised in the resolution oresented to the Council at its October meeting a copy of which is attached, but many other objections and criticisms which have been received from members of the Committee from members of the Petroleum Industry War Council and from the Industry. Careful consideration was given to all the points raised and the changes suggested were those thought necessary by the Committee to meet these objections. While the final results do not represent the preferred views of any individual, the Committee submits the enclosed suggested revision of the oil agreement with the recommendation that it is substituted for the original agreement. It must be recognised that as additional experience is gained, further changes and^ modifications may prove desirable. In submitting this revised agreement it is assumed that the submission of this report does not foreclose or impede expression of views by individual members of the Committee or by others and that the recommendations are not binding as future commitments on members of the Committee or of the Petroleum Industry War Council nor will it operate to prevent any member of the National Oil Policy Committee or~the Petroleum Industry War Council faxm from Baking such individual or joint recommendations as they might desire by order of National Oil Policy Committee, A. Jacobson, chairman. 3. (B ) Preamble. The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Article 6. The signatory governments agree (1) no provision in this agreement shall be construed to apply to the operation of the Domestic Petroleum Industry within either country (2) no provision in this agreement shall be construed to prevent a signatory government from taking such action as it may desire to limit the amount of petroleum which may be imported into its country.-5- Article 7, The signatory governments agree that for purposes of this agreement. the (1) the word ” country” (A) in relation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland means England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

(Special to The New YorLk Times). CHICAGO, Dec.8. Secretary Ickes told the Chicago Council of Foreign Relations today that he hoped the American people now understood that the best safeguard against another war would be the joint undertaking by the peace-loving nations to keep down the supplies of oil to Germany and Japan to such an extent that they could never go to war again. Speaking in his capacity as Petroleum Administrator, Mr. Ickes devoted his speech to defense and advocacy of a £165,000,000 pip&amp;Iine and a 1,000,000,000-barrel oil reserve in Saudi Arabia. Asked in the question period hew the United States could prevent the seizure of such a reserve in case of war, he replied: 'We'd have to do the best we can, just as we do with other possessions removed from our shores”. After discussing the greed and struggle for oil among countries and warning that 'the field of foreign oil is strewn with traps, both economic and political”, Mr. Ickes defended his proposal for the much-publicized 'Arabian pipe line” and the Anglo-American oil agreement, of which, he said, ”1 speak as one of its creators”. Gives Estimate on pavings . ”The proposal calls for building of a pipeline from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, the line to be financed and owned by the Government”, he said. ”It provides for operation by the Standard Oil Company of Cali fornia, the Texas Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation, which have large concessions in Saudi Arabia, Bahrein Island and Kuwait• “The Government provides that the* companies set aside a crude-oil reserve of 1,000,000,000 barrels in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to be available for our armed forces at any time within fifty years at a price 25 percent below the market. At current prices this would constitute a saving of more than a quarter billion dollars to the Government”. Mr. Ickes added: “It happens I ain not the one who proposed this pipeline; the man who did id is Admiral A.F.Carter of the Navy, But I an not going to deny that I supported it”. Proposed Oil Pact Discussed . In discussing the Anglo-American oil pact, which Senator Connally of Texas, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted a few days ago would “never be reported out by the committee”, the Secretary said: “Mindful of the mistakes of the past, of cannibalistic competition and a not too altruistic record for the interest of weaker nations the negotiators undertook to build on a better foundation for the future. “They agreed that adequate supplies of petroleum\ Should be available in international trade to nationals of all peaceable countries. They went on record in support of equal opportunity in the acquistion of future exploration and development rights. They pledged themselves mutually to res pect all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights'' • Mr ^ Ickes conaluded by saying that the petroleum industry Avar council, composed of seventy-six representatives of oil companies, had gone over theAnglo-American agreement, 'aided by their lawyers and by Judge Manly Hudson of the Permanent Court of International Justice', and that this body during six weeks of study had suggested changes. These, he added, were submitted back to the Governments on Wednesday, and it was now up to the Governments to accept, modify or reject them.Ext. 2025/1945 W.0653/12/76 (.CYPHER) OUTWARD TELEGRAI.

This step occasioned considerable difficulties with certain Governments and Rulers who declined to accept force ma.lenre as the reason for the I.P.C ? s inactivity Company were therefore obliged to negotiate moratoriums on varying terms which'at this, stage of the war are unlikely to be extended. Company's obligations in different concessions will mature at approx'mately the same time and they are therefore anxious to restart developmcwit on a programme which is designed to ensure as far as possible that all'areas receive equally favourable treatment. Some of the rulers concerned have not failed to compare the I.P.^s inactivity with the increased activity of American Compiles in their neighbourhood and as you know projects for American pipelines and other developments have attracted great publicity all over the Middle East. Moreover American Coys, would doubtless take up any concession or licence which • might lapse through the inability of the I.P.C. to fulfil their obligations owing to lack of equipment etc. . 2. In view of political, strategic and economic importance to our position in the I iddle .^ast and the Persian Gulf of maintaining and developing the oil concessions of British Companies in those areas we are anxious to give the I.P.C. all possible assistance towards resuming exploration of their concessionary areas without delay. Surveys will require considerable tine before drilling can usefully be ’undertaken to comply with ^■concessionary obligations and it is therefore most desirable for the Company’s programme to be agreed with the United States authorities as soon as possible. 3 # In our view the early resumption of I.P.C. development is of special importance in order to avoid undesirable political repercussions which right well result if the local rulers should doubt our willingness or ability to live up to our opportunities and commitments. Recession' of the war from the Middle East with the consequent reduction of allied spending may 'e expected to create unemployment and economic problems. Renewal of operations by the I.P.C. will go some way towards absorbing local labour and easing local economic difficulties. 4. ‘ Please4 # Please support through the 3tate Department on political grounds representations which British Petroleum Representative has been instructed to make.

Middle Past Oil. ^ d C d S p-c/i, World lajportarce. 1. During the past decade, the Middle Past lias eiiierged as potentially the world’s greatest oil reservoir. Vast new deposits have? oeen discovered in the area, as a result of which Middle East oil reserves are now estimated to represent yj/o oi the total known oil reserves of the world. This is only exceedea by North America, with iOjo ox tiie known oil reserves of the v/orld. But whereas, in North America the oil fields are being worked to capacity, in the Middle dast only a very swiall proportion of the avail able oil supply is as yet being tapped. In 1944* North American prodactron of cruu.e oil was 1,750 million barrels whilst that of the Middle Past was only 134 million barrels. (7 barrels = approx 1 ton). At this rate, U.3. known reserves would be sufficient for only 12 years; whereas Middle East supplies woula suffice for 100 years. A very isw ’under these conditions Would completely change the world oil supply situation; in to«' years, North American oil supplies would be approaching exhaustion, whereas Middle East oilfields would reoresent nearly of the total world reserves of crude oil, ( 14,000 million barrels against 11,000 million barrels for the rest of the world). ^ 2. The above facts were brought to li^ht by an official oil commission which rep bed to the American Congress in 1945* A summary ©f the commission's findings with regard to the statistical position of the world oil production and reserve in . 194 d is given below.

The above figures are based on the oil situation as it was in 1544 ana che position is of course liable to some modification. It is, for exa.ple, ...ore- than' probable that further new »ilfields will be uiscovex'ed in the next few years. Active prospecting is in progress throughout the world. But in view of the amount of prospect ing already carried out in North America, there is less probability of big now discover ies there than in less known areas such,as the middle East ana U.3.b.A, 4. New discoveries together with-uevoloyment of synthetic proaaction may help the U.S.A. to meet her essential requirements for home consumption for long time bo come, but it is extremely unlikely that they will allow her to maintain her position 3 the world’s greatest oil supplying area. Already U.S. strategists have- raised a cry of alarm that U.S. oil supplies are insufficient for another oil war. The policy of re striction of oil exports with a view to conservation’ of home-supply has already been adopted in principle in American official quarters. It is possible that before long the United States will cease to be an oil: exporting area ana later still it may even become an oil importing country. 3 . Its place, as far as U.K., Europe, the Meaiterranean, the middle East, Africa and the Indian Ocean is concerned, will be largely taken by the middle mast. Consider able quantities of Iraq and Persian oil were shipped to Europe even jexore the war. This process is obviously going to expand in view of the increase in production and * X-^nojected pipeline developments to the Mediterranean basin. In fact, it appears ppobable that during the next few years, the Middle East will, to a. lar^e extent, sup plant the U.S. as the world’s principal oil exporting area. /The imxxor bance .......6 , The importance of this froai pi strategic point of view cahuoc oe ovtjr~ emphasised. Adequate oil supplies ar^ essential to modern warfare, i-iven ii ic is mue, as is sometimes claimed, that atomic energy is destined to become 'cue. pov/uT ox cue future, it will be many years before it can be universally applied, and the problem of controlling atomic energy for use in smaller power plants may well be insoluole. •even if, in the next few years, atomic energy is rendered practicable for large power pianos, the day when it can replace the petrol-drawn internal combustion online in venicles are aircraft is still a long way off. In the meantime, petroleum will acquire increasing importance as world stocks diminish, . ■ 1 . ' . , : 7* Apart from its importance as a potential world supply centre, Uiu&amp;le iuasc oil is of particular strategic value to the British Bmpiro because of its geographical location. Placed at the junction of Europe and the Par East, at the main croas-roads between England, India, Australia and South Africa, the, kindle East dominates strategic Empire communications. The nearest alternative sources of oil supply are America to the West, and Burma and Borneo to the East, It i^i true them io the Norte, hie oil fields of Rcumania and of Russia are nearer as the crow flics, but even in uimes Ox peace, little oil is available from these.sources, all available exports being taken by the nearer European market, while in time of war, as we have seen m tau past two C-r^ t Wars, supplies from the 'north are likely to be entirely cut off# The experience oi a-- last two wars has, also shown the difficulty, and the danger, of movin - large supplies rf cil by tanker across thousands if miles of ocean, liable at any moment co attac-c by sea or. air. Already in these two wars, the relatively small quantities of oilj available from local production in the Middle East have helped to tip the scales in chis arec from defeat to victory, ShouL.i Middle East supplies be destroyed, or should they tail into enemy hands, it might well prove impossible for us to defend this vital area, in a few years time, when the expected expansion of Middle East oil production- has taken place, possession of these oil supplies may well prove to be the auciarng factor not only in the defence of the Middle East but in the prosecution of the war as a whole. In these circumstances, Britain's predominant position in cue i.iiucxle East petroleum world assumes great significance* At a rough estimate,• Britain concrols 70 — IJfo- Of present Middle East production and about 6 G£o of Middle East estEda'ceu reserves. The Abadan, Haifa and Suez refineries are likewise British controlled. In marketing, British companies are predominant in practically every niudle Eastern couircry with die exception of Levant States, Cyprus, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 9.

The value Ox this, not only.in providing employment for a large number of British technical anu aumx:. xstrative employees over seas, but also in ensuring the fullest co-operation v.itu the Services cannot be over emphasised. To take the single case rf the Shell Co. in Egypt; the presence ox a nucleus of British Staff enabled the Shell Co. immediately on the outbreak oi wax'* to take upon itself duties in connection with the supply not only ox civilian requixgx.ik.-n ts but also of the Services’ wartime needs, including both supplies and j,corage facilities and even the provision *£ containers-in vast numbers. The organisation oi tne Brltisn oil companies throughout the area .was suen that the Services and H.1.I, Or, could-usc; them virtually as a British Government Department, This v/as only possible oy virtue ox one- fact that the key men of the oil companies 1 staffs were British. Today the oil / companies in practically all Middle East countries are faced with an increasing spirit cl nationalism, one of the objects of which is to replace all the British Staff local nationals. Should this policy be pushed too far, it might prove an embarrassment to Britain and her allies in the event of again being involved m war in this area. 11. After the British, the most important oil interests in the Middle EaSb are &gt; now those of the Americans. During recent years American oil companies, faced -with the prospect of decreasing supplies, at home, have turned with increasing urgency • ie . Middle East and have been most active in search of concessions anu ip ^loration. ^ineir greatest successes to. date have been in Saudi Arabia, Bahrein ana ^uwait. m Araoia particularly, American interests are rapidly extending. /Other countriesfc P.I.C.

Persian Government and the A. 1*0.0. had become strained and the Governmenenaeavouxed to cancel the concession, iffter much controversy a new sixty-year concession was. granted an 29 x.pril 1935. Under the new. concession the area was reduced to 100,000 square'miles, various, other, privileges were withdrawn from the Company and the royalties and taxes 00 be paid to the Persian Government were considerably increased.

It played a vital part in the Allied war effort, supplying oil both to the Middle- Ba? v and to India and che Par East. After the loss of the Par Eastern oil supplies in 1942 it bee ae apparent that the refinery, big as it was, would be insuffic ient to meet all demands, and large-scale expansion was undertaken. By December 1944 additional annual refinery capacity of a, 000,000 cons haa been added, briiu-.j-ng up cn.c f]*# total capacity to some 1p,000,000 tons per annum. This has since been scill fiu. ober increc ed and at present approaches 20 ,000,000,tons per annum. In the meantime new processes have been added and in particular the production of high-octane aviation petrol has been enor ^nsly increased.

It is now available for U.K. and British Empire requirements. 21* The A,1.0,0. concession also covers a much smaller oilfield in western Persia at Naft-i-$hah. Oil from this field goes by pipeline to a small reiinery at Kemansnah where it is refined, products being sold for local consumption in Persia x^seli • 22. The A.I.O.C. also has interests in Iran, through its share in the Iraq Petro-^ loum Co., in the Haifa refinery, and in the newly developed centre of oil production at Kuwait• 23. Although che British-owned A.I.0.0. concession is the only oil concession a present operative in Persia, i^any other countries have attempted to gain a footing^there in the past and there is every likelihood of further attempts in the future. A.orican, Russian, Dutch, French and even Japanese combines have all attempted, at various mnes, ( to obtain concessions. 24. A Dutch mining group, -die Algemeene .ExpIoratio Mij ov/ns an exploraoory -ic for mi nerals covering part of northern Iran, gran ted in *1939 and giving them ^ oil scare r and exploration rights' as vvell as the right co^ search for other minerals, buo lxr-,Le or no exploration has been carried out under tiis licence. . , - . 28 The aain struggle for concessions in the remainder of xho cournay nan Dean between British, Russians and Americans fine. ,goes back to the J 920's; ^ The enormous strategic and economic importance of petroleum was first realised during che Greao car, 1914-18 and immediatelv after the War there was a rush to acraiire petroleum cencessions in various parts of the*'world. In Northern Persia, American, British and Russian, interests were in competition. In 1921, .the Standard Oil‘Company of America proposed an oil concession in the Nertliefn Provinces in exchange for a-loan ol ten million dollars. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company then claimed -chat they already held a concession which they had acquired in 1 c 20. The following year (1923), a joint An-Amor 1 can undertaking w;*s oropostd, to exploit North Persian oil on a fifty-fifty basis. Upr _ ,n this, the Russians intervened. The Soviet Ambassador to Tehran officially imormed one Persian Government that Moscow would oppose any concession ^foreigners -r xna ex ploitation of oil in Northern Persia. Exclusi^ rights 01 exploit non, he cxa.jncd., belonged to a Russian subject. (The Russian sublet in a native of Georgia, Ifts acouired somewhat doubtful concessiona aa-ca l.,.o &lt;.1 . , therwero choGHha vtoc-h the Anglo-^rsiar Oil Co. clamed to tave ^rc^aea from in 1920).

In 1^25, a •Russo-Porsian oil company, the Kcvir Khouriaii Co., ^registered in Persi Jk s a Persian Co., but mainly financed by the Russian Government, waef established to exploit an eld oil concession ih the Semmn are .,(originally granted in 1878 to, Persian subjects and re registered in 1.92-1 by their descendants who sold 75 &gt;j.oT their rights to x the Russian* Kbc*chtiara). The company carried out a nunber of sounaings in various places in N.E, Persia hue 'failed to strike oil. The Persian Government subsequently exai-ed that the cheese ion was null and void as it had never been ratified. In h jo, eho Persi^m Government granted exploration rights in this area to the Am Iran ion Oil Company, an iuneriean-Pursian company, but the-concession was abandoned in 19 go. In 1&gt;-M:, ’Gne Royal Dutch Shell and the Standard Vacuum Groups entered into negotiation ..-itu the Persian Governinenf for concessions in the South-east of Persia. Once again tne Russians- -artivad on e scene. In September 1944* id Kavtaradze, Soviet x.ssistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tehran with a committee of oil experts, ostensibly so raise the matter of the Khoufian oil concession. However, after the first meeting, situ the Persian Prime Min istor (Saea), the Khourian question was never a^ain men cloned. Instead, Kavtaradze. demanded a new concession giving the Sovxoi Govern.nenc exploratory rights over an area 210,000 square miles in Northern Persia, from ^erbuijan to v^uchan, for 0 . period of j years, after which they (the Russians; would specify the aro&lt;..s tn&lt;-y v/xstj&amp;d to exploit. The Persians, not unnaturally, resisted this- a cm and. Kavtarause brought very strong pressure to bear. Doubtless he felt that he hau.^pod carus in his nanus. The international prestige rf Russia stood very high, anti Russian troops wore is oedupaexon in Northern Iran. Saed however held firm, Russxan-ongineered uejonstrations in Tehran and elsewhere, using the Tudeh Party, only served go strengthen the resistance of the majority of the Persians. British support and pobiicitj helped to f wfeo^uien tie Persian resistance, and they no‘w decided that no oil concessions wpulc, be granted till &lt;d*ter the withdrawal n f foreigp trrops which was due to tame place \ itu.in 6 months of i.ho end- of the war. Kavtaradze made no effort to disguise his an L y-r . In an efforc to t a./pease the Russian's, Saod resigned, and was replaced by 8 ay at, Russian pressure contin^ud until, on ^.jpecomber 1944, the Majlis, in a sudden show . 0 .. .resolutiop., .■r’.^iep^ji^.rqy.: h. a Bill of dou ; ui’gency which forbade-any Persian Pri.-ie minister, kin is ter, or ''Under Secretary entering into any negotiation or signing any agreement with re 0 cre to oil concessions on patui cf imprisonment, Kavtaradze’s fury knew no bounds. A vioek later he left for Moscow, not before stating that he expected the Majlis to rectify its mistake. 29. The veto applied equally of course to British ana Americans and negotiations for concessions in the South-east by both groups were suspended. 30 . Events during the past few months show that despite their failure to obtain official per;;.ission the Russians ho.ve by no means renounced their aims xn Northern Persia, 'Russian support to the Democratic Party’s programme of autonomy for Azerbaijan is doubt less designed to ive them a predominating, influence in that area, dtia reports have already been received that the Russians arc carrying out exploratory borxug for oil in the Tabriz area.

'41, The ruai.n con .re of production is arou.'id Kirkuk. This is an extremely rich field,with reserves estimated at 4,000 million barrels. At present the only limiting factor to Nie amount that can be produced is the question of transport. 'To move the oil to the sea coast, the first stage of its journey to the world’s markets, the crude, oil is sent by pipeline, a distance of-over 300 miles to hie Mediterranean coast. A double pipeline runs from Kirkuk, both pipes running parallel to Haditha one then ! y i /running v.'cst7 mku \ \ 4 running west to Tripoli in the Lebanon, while the other runs south-west along age-cld 'caravan routes, through Transjordan to Haifa, in Palestine. The northern (Tripoli) pipe line serves French ana American interests, the southern (Haifa) piepline is usud by the British and .anglo-Dutch. The present combined pipeline capacity is 4,000,000 tons per annum ( 2 , 000,000 tons per annum by each pipeline,) but additional anu. larger pipelines are under consideration which will bring up the total capacity to 1 :., 000,000 tons per annum in che course of the next few years. • 42. Before the war, the whole #f the crude oil was chipped a*.ay i.rom Iiaifa and Tripoli in tankers to be refined abroad in France, Italy, b., England, etc. In 1539 however, a refinery was under construction at Haifa. (Consolidated Heilurries Ltd., controlled by a. I.0, C. and Eoyal Dutch-Shell) • On the outbrea:; oi'oar, oons truction^ was expedited and the refinery started to operate in 1539, with oapacio^ oi a,00-0,000 tono per annum, equivalent that is to the pipeline capacity to Haifa. -On the collapse of France in 1940, the northern (Tripoli) pipe].int was closed from the Kirkuk end and was not ro-opened until the Allied troops re-occupied Lyna in 1 %-2* Even then, as the Mediterranean remained closed, it was x.jpossibae to car.y ns*ay ti. crude oil for refining. To meet ohis situation, the reiinery capacity at Mail.a was expanded until, by 1944 , it was able to deal with oho lull' turoughpat ox 4 , 00 u, 0 aO tons per annum from both pipelines, the cru^e oil bein^ carried oy Canmers . rom Tripoli to Haifa. The iil production from this refinery proved invaluable to tue Imperial xorces in / 3 Middle East area during the war. Fortunately in s.fite ox a number Ox air atto.c*.s by tiie Italians little damage was done and the refinery was never put ouf ox oper^cion. It is intended to expand still further the capacity ox' tais rex'iner., co i..ec t the-input of oil from a new pipeline already under construction to iiaifa. 4- 4 ,Ixfc- ia .vils 3 iiitotraded to construct a lar^o rei’inor^ at fri oli. .Oui ing w&lt;xi the French constructed a smodl tapping plant Ctiere with improvisou res turcos oo provide petrol and fuel oil for local requiratents.

Eventually it is intended that refinery capacity at Tripoli and daixa snail we suxiicicno to deal with the full quantity of 12,000,000 tons per annum to )e oaou^.ut in oy^pipeline# 4.5• During the war a ntutb^r 4f the wells in Iraq were plugged as .au*oi^ tiie -.iddle Eastern Denial. Scheme. At one cime only five wells were in producei ;n in tne Kirku]. area, but these were easily able to produce all the oil tnat could be :o/ed oy che single pipeline then in use. The richness of the field may oe gathered from the fact that only fifty wells, including test ’.veils, have be^n drilled in bne K ii’kulc cxroa, as compared w.ith the thousands of wells of many iuterican and Russian oilfields. ^ A6, In the concession in N..YT. Iraq, large reserves of a heavy and sulphor#ps oil have been found'at Qaiyarah, but the quality is not such as to justiiy comi:jercial proc’^tion. The war has prevented further exploration in this arua out prospects are &gt;&lt;Pliuved to be gpod. v 47 , The Basrah concession was only granted shortly before uhc war, ana there at - lS been no opportunity to carry out proper exploratory surveys. Meyer che less in view ff its location between the rich oilfield of Kirkuk to the north an.* that ox Kuwait to che South there is good reason to expect excellent results. 4 . 8 . The Khanaquin Oil Company’s concession in Eastern Ira^ includes a sciall oal- fiuld at Naft Khaneh, just opposite the Naft-i-Shah oilfield in Persia, v/i^ii wljicd in fact it forms a single field. The output from the Haft Khaneh field, sa..c 400,000 - 250,000 tons per annum, is piped under natural pressure to a s-nj-l rem xnery a^iU-Wauc,. five miles away.

By a strange coincidence, in both wars E ]pt was fortunate \ /enough to, i B ^ enough to discover new sources of oil, as a result 01 which i no reaped cuanuities of petroleuia products were ? roduced at the most critical momenc, in an area in wh_ch oh increased supplies 'were of vital importance. ^ -u An-in- 52 .

Production dares back to 1911, *en oil was struck ar Gemsah, on Jie western shore of the Red Sea, some 150 miles south of Sues. The wol,s here here yielded only a . snail production but in 1914 the Hurghada oilfield v^s discovered. was rapidly developed during the 1914-19 war, yielding in 1918 a peak ol 1 , 9 po, 000 barrels, an excessive rate of production for this field,.which literally 'wore itself ou. m the service^of^the^Allies'., ^ Hurgll£da fiela continued on a reduced rate and with a tendency to fall. In 19'38 however, a new and bigger oilfield was discovered at Ras Gharib, some 120 miles south of Sues, and by September 1939 production ^om lus field had risen to 15,000 barrels per day. Since 1938,almost the whole 01 -ne pro a. ^ has been obtained from Ras Gharib, Hurghada being practically exhausted. , 55 . The new discovery, caning as it did just before the opening of a second Worri War, was of great value to the Allied cause. The transport of petrol from Abadan, ove 3,060 miles away, or from America round South Africa, became almost prohibitive in 1940 42 when Allied tanker losses assumed unprecedented proportions. Only trie prssenc of supplies on the spot helped to ease what would ^erwise have been an ^ tolerable strain. Ras Gharib production rose to over 9.000.000 barrels (1,250,000 von ) per annum. ra pj a increase in production from the Ras Gharib field called for a correspending increase in refinery facilities at Sues to cope with the unexpectedly hidi level of production. The outbreak of war made it impossible to embark on a normal proerranne of refinery expansion and development, ‘but ly ingenious adjustrnen s a SXrfghput, if was'found possible to cope with the^U productio^rud^ oU. . 57.

The first, with the /mglo-Iranian Oil Company (in which the British Government is the majority share holder) provides for prior investigation of the possibi lity of constructing a pipeline from the Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean, to be owned In part by the Standard Oil Company. The second arrangement, not related to the first, contemplates acquisition by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of about 30 percent Interest in the Arablan- Kmerican Oil Company which owns oil-producing properties in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia and is jointly owned by the Standard Gil Company of California and the Texas Oil Company. One of the pipelines is expected to be a 26-lnch line 1,200 miles long from the Persian Gulf to Haifa, saving &amp; long voyage by tankers through the Bed Sea and the Suez Canal. The Middle kast is a great oil supplier, particularly for Britain and Europe, and reputable oil experts are convinced that Arabia will, within relatively few years, be the biggest oil producer, not merely in the Middle Hast, but probably in the whole of the world. The pipeline will then be one of the most Important in the world. The Standard Oil company's statement said that the agreement provided for prior investigation of the possi bility of construction of a pipeline to be owned in part by the lev Jersey company from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean. It is expected that under such a contract the volume of the New Jersey company 1 s crude oil purchases would Increase gradually over the period of the agreement to meet the expected increase in world demand for petroleum products. The company also confirmed the fact of a preliminary agreement on a separate proposed transaction looking towards Increased utilization of Middle Hast crude oil by the New Jersey company affiliates. This is under discussion with the Arabian American Gil Company but is not related to the negotiation with the Angio-Iranian Company. The agreement with the Arabian American company would involve acquisition of approximately 1 30 per cent Interest in the latter company who se producing properties are in the eastern portion of Saudi Arabia. The statement declared that it is also contemplated that the Standard Gil Company of New Jersey will share the cost of an additional projected pipeline from the Persian Gulf to an eastern Mediterranean terminal in proportion to its Interest in the iirablan American cil Company. v hile the agreement in principle has been reached with the Arabian American Oil Company, its final conclusion is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of the surveys and discussions now in progress. The Standard ....page 2 #—y The standard Oil Company said that the two proposals aimed at bringing the company's future crude oil supply position in the European areas into balance with its expected market demands. another result of these proposals would be to make crude oil available to the Standard Vacuum Oil Company (a 60 per cent owned Jersey affiliate) with producing, refining and marketing operations in the Far East. This would materially strengthen the Standard Vacuum Company's position as the company before the war produced oil only in the Netherlands East Indies, and this production was never sufficient to meet the market demand in the Far East. It is expected that tnis increase in crude oil supply will require some increase in the refining capacity of the Jersey company affiliates in the European area, but there are no definite plans in this connection as yet, the statement added. The -ocony Vacuum Oil Company tonight also Issued a statement in New York saying that the company is negotiating with the Ang o Iranian Oil Company for the purchase of substan tial quantities of crude oil over a period of 10 to 20 years. The purchase would be contingent, the statement said, on the construction of the pipeline between the Persian Gulf and the editerranean over the route to be determined by investigation. If the negotiations were concluded, the statement added, the agreement would help to supply the Socony Vacuum foreign market west of Sues. - Reuter. No. 91 - S.

He is on the diplomatic list here and is described as “Attache Adjoint (Questions Petrolieres)', his appointment dating from April, 1946. I gather that In normal ^ life he was an accounts clerk, or something of the kina, in one of the American oil companies and after the war was appointed as assistant to the then American Oil attache, a senior man by ^ the name of Pagett. Pagett has since faded out but Sullivan has •stayed on. The general impression I gather is that he is carving out a job for himself by asking a lot of questions from anybody he can get hold of, compiling statistics and, to be frank, making a general nuisance of himslef. It would be unwise to trust him too far but, on the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that he is visious or harflful. He is a hail-1 ellow- well-met type of man who goes in a good deal for social functions. On the whole, I should say that he should be .treated with a certain amount of reserve but handled tactfully. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A. Overton Colonel W.R. Hay, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. SKCxthl D.G.N0.95-S PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, the 16th January, 1947 My dear Sir Arnold, On the 11th January I received a call from Childs, the American Minister at Jeddah. He brought with him one Don. J. Sullivan who described himslef as the American Oil Attache for the Middle East, and asked me a number of pertinent questions about oil matters in the Gulf. He stated his intention of returning here shortly when he hopes to interview Packer, the local Petroleum Concessions Limited Manager, and also to visit the Trucial Coast and find out what Petroleum Concessions Limited are doing there. 2. I should be grateful for anything you can let me know about Sullivan. I gather he made himself rather unpopular with the American Manager of the BAPCO here and I think we may find him a bit of a nuisance. As however he was introduced to me by Childs I propose to give such assistance in the way of travel facilities as is possible and any information about oil developments which is not of a highly confidential nature.

The capital expenditure on materials nd equipment has been and will continue to be very great, nevertheless in sane areas developments were being slowed down through shortage of certain a Pplies caused by delay in delivery from manufacturers.

Thus the Middle East proven reserves of petroleum, as calculated for the end of 1946 at 5,504 million tons and representing about 50f« of the world's total, have recently been increased. The revised estimate of proven reserves is b,u/4 million tons, the production and reserves of individual countries in millions of tons being as follows Country Persia Iraq Saudi Arabia Kuwait Qatar Bahrein Egypt Totals Production 1946 19.2 W 8.0 0.8 Nil 1 . 1 1.3 33.1 Proven Reserve Revised as at end 19^ Proven Reserve British Share of Reserve 1,733 1,115 1,773 1,720 1,720 969 1,000 1,400 Nil 1,000 1,000 500 100 100 50 20 60 Nil 9 9 9 5,58b. 6,074 3,303 The main increase in proven reserve has been for Saudi Arabia, which has been raised by R00 million tons.

I. S. 23 andW.O.S. 1. The strong reserve position of Gach Saran and Agha Jari make it evident that these two lields could maintain a much higher rate of production than indicated in the above programme. This is realized by A.I.O.C. and as far as Gach Saranis concerned the iiimediate plan is to increase production to 3*36 million tons by exporting this crude from Mashur instead of Abadan. Agha Jari production may reach 16 million tons by 1950 if increased outlet iacilities eccome available in time. Further increases in production from the Persian i ields depend on the date of completion of additional pipelines, storage capacity, wharfage etc. The projected pipeline from Persia to the Mediterranean, v/ith a connection to Kuwait, is expected to have an annual capacity of 15 million oono. ,'v A recent development has been in Lali about 25 miles north of M.I.S. where a well obtained oil at a daily rate of 28,000 barrels (about 4,000 tons), a record for Persia. A pipeline, capable of handling about half of this production,, is being put into operation as soon as possible and subsequently a 12' line is also to be laid. Towards the end of this year it is intended to drill an exploration well on a well defined structure near Ahwaz, which will be of particular interest since it should throw light on the oil prospects of the^coastal plain which forms the immediate hinterland to Abadan and which is advantageously situated with regard to easy access to seaboard. Besides the producing fields I visited or flew over other parts of the concession area in the foothill belt on the trend of the main fields. It was apparent that the company controls other high-grade prospects, which offer enormous potential oil possibilities and speculative reserves perhaps four times as great as the proven reserves. KUWAIT In the sheikdom of Kuwait, oilfield developments were at an early stage and there was in particular much house building in progress in preparationfor the expansion of operations. The production and export of crude oil which began in June 1946, had been somewhat interrupted owing to shortage of tankers. In April 1947 the Burgan field was producing at a rate of nearly 50,000 barrels per day from 8 wells. It was expected that by the end of this year the production would be at a rate of 150,000 barrels per day, this being equivalent to an annual production of 7'f million tons, which may be doubled by 1950. The Kuwait Oil Company, which is owned jointly by the Anglo-Iranian and the Gulf Ccmpanies, has a predominantly British staff. Some posts were filled by Americans and in order to carry out a programme of drilling 72 oil wells in two years, 80 American drillers were being engaged. The terrain is flat with a fairly hard desert surface and thus ideal for rapid exploitation under good transportation conditions. Outlet is also easy since the distance from the field to the sea-loading terminal at Pahaheel is only 15 miles. A local problem is the provision of drinking and fresh water. The Company’s requirements of drinking water were being met by distillation of sea water, using the great excess of natural gas from the field as fuel for the boilers. A good supply cf somewhat brackish water, suitable for baths and irrigation, was being obtained from wells drilled by the company in an area west of the field. In addition, fresh water is imported by ship fr om the Shatt-el-Arab, which provides all the water consumed in the town of Kuwait. An examination of the geophysical map showed that the Burgan gravity structure extends to the northern boundary of the Neutral Zone, which thus may hold favourable oil prospects. Three oil companies were making competitive bids for the acquisition of the petroleum rights of the Neutral Zone from the Sheik of Kuwait, where Saudi Arabia has a half interest, which has been acquired by the Arabian American Oil Company. I discussed the subject of the future development of the Neutral Zone -with the Political Agent and it was considered that it would be preferable not to make a physical split of the territory between the two rulers. It was apparent that the companies preferred to spread their chances over the entire Neutral Zone and thus in due course it would be necessary to explain to the rulers that an undivided interest for each had similar advantages for them. In this connection, it was thought that a division of the territory might lead to complications if oil were discovered in one part and not in the other. Since the Sheik of Kuwait would soon be receiving large sums of money in payment of oil royalties the question of how a part of this money might be usefully expended was discussed and it was thought that perhaps the provision of an adequate local water supply came first in Kuwait's needs. BAiREIN The Bahrein Petroleum Company, which is registered in Canada, is controlled by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Company and the oilfield has been in production since 1952. Over half of the European staff is British, but Americans hold most of the better positions. The field is about 7 miles long and 2^ miles v/ide and the proven reserve shown to me was about 60 million tons, an increase over our previous estimates. Since the pressure is declining and there is some water encroachment into the producing formation, repressuring by gas injection is being undertaken. Production, which was being taken from 68 wells, is likely to be maintained at around 25,000 barrels per day (1^ million tons per year) from the shallow depth of between 2,000 and 2,250 feet and up to the end of 1946 about 10.5 million tons had been produced. A deep test was begun before the war but suspended at about 4,500 feet. It is intended to deepen this well, which is thought to have good chances of obtaining production from lower levels, v/hich are oil-bearing in Arabia, SAUDI ARAB IA The Saudi Arabian concession is controlled by the ^rabian-American Oil Company (Aramco) and arrangements for my visit had been made by the Petroleum Division with the company’s New York Office. Nevertheless, when I arrivedat Dahran, their headquarters in Arabia, I found that at first my welcome was not very cordial* It seemed that their managing director was suspicious as to the purpose of my coming to Arabia and appeared to think that the Saudi Arabian government might misinterpret my visit as being somehow connected with intercompany differences over the Red Line agreement* In addition it was evident that some of their staff had been given instructions not to impart too much information regarding their operations. This attitude has been fully in keeping with their relations vis-a-vis geologists of the British oil companies in the Middle East, none of whom have as yet been given an opportunity to visit itramco’s oilfields. Nevertheless, I was able to get a clear impression of their operations by going to different areas where drilling was in progress. Production . In Saudi Arabia production of oil in quantity began in 1939 when the volume produced was about one half of a million tons. This was doubled by 1914 and in 19A5 was about 2.8 million tons. In 19^ production rose rapidly to 7.9 million tons, the total production for the country up to the end of 19l£ being about 15 million tons. The localities where oil in commercial quantities has been discovered are as follows Field Proven Pieserve Millions of Tons Production April 19A7 Barrels per day. Forecast of Production by the end of 19A7 Barrels per day Abqaiq 900 121,000 (1A wells) 250,000 Damman 200 90,000 (31 wells) 90,000 Qatif 150 10,000 (1 well) 30,000 Abu Kadriya 150 no outlet Total 1, A00 &gt;21,000 320,000 (equivc ilent to a rate of (16 million tons per million tons per year) year) The rtbqaiq field, situated AO miles S.T7. of Damman, was being rapidly developed, employing 5 drilling outfits operating continuously. The wells arc et between 6 and 7,000 feet deep and the average rate of completion per well is 80 days. ii. further increase in Abqaiq production may be expected since gas separators were being constructed with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day and a possible future production of 500,000 barrels a day for this field was being spoken of. The proven area of the field is about 15 miles long and 6 miles wide, the limits of productive terrain having not been reached in either direction. About 15 miles north of rffbqaiq an exploration well has been drilled on the continuation of the same trend and this was reported to have encountered the oil pay at a depth slightly lower than at Abqaiq. This well was expected to be a producer and may indicate a further important extension of the field. The high gas pressure and the porous nature of the limestone reservoir indicate that Abqaiq is a field of enormous size, and it is believed that the reserve estimate presented above may prove to be too conservative. The Danman field was brought into production in 1936 and requires the^ drilling of only a few more wells to drain the entire field. The productive area is°5 by 3^ miles and the main producing level around A, 300 feet in depth. The Qatif field had only one oil well which was producing, while one outfit was drilling additional wells, the depth to the oil level being around 7,500 feet. Similarly, there was only one well at Abu Kadriya, which had no pipeline outlet. This well is of special interest since it penetrated the oil levels found in the fields further south without obtaining production, whereas a new producing horizon was discovered 1,200 feet deeper. It was not possible for me to obtain any data on the results of company s exploration in other parts of Arabia but it is evident that there must be other areas as promising as those already drilled. Equipment. The part of Saudi Arabia where the oilfields have been found is for theJ • * '\eM - 5 - I .a part very arid sandy desert. It is worst in the Abqaiq region v/hich is a veritable sand sea of high and ever drifting dunes, presenting a formidable transportation problem for the company. The movement of drilling equipment is carried out by using giant multi-wheeled trailers hauled by pOv^erful trucks, all with oversized tyres. The cost in imintenance of transportation in the oilfield was said to be about five times that in the U.S.a. A visit to the company’s store showed that they held large stocks of pipe and oilfield equipment of every kind and it was obvious that they were much better off in this respect than the British oil companies. These ample supplies Y/ere making possible the very rapid increase in Aramco's rate of oil production. Housing and Climate. The main camp at Dahran, which is in the centre of the Damman field, has the appearance of a small Texan town. The houses are very modern and provided with every comfort possible including a central air conditioning plant. Cooling is practically essential in the summer when the shade temperature is around 120°!? and discomfort is increased by dust storms. The company was employing about 1,200 Americans in .^rabia, 500 of whom were in Dahran. Native employees were reported as 7,100 .Arabs and 620 other Asiatics, mostly Indians. The Abqaiq drilling camp presented a bleak aspect being subject to drifting sand, v/hich is diverted from burying the houses by the protection of v-shaped walls of sheet iron. It was apparent that some of the American personnel found ^rabian living conditions very hard and consequently there was a considerable turnover in personnel, due to their refusal to stay for longer periods. IRAQ PETROLEUM COMPANY ARH.S — « ■■■ d.,mm —^ - — ■■■■ »— tmm M . ■■ i I ■■ QjuTAR Before and during the earlier part of the war the compary drilled three wells in the Dukhan field v;hich were plugged and abandoned on instructions from military authority. Two of these v/ells proved the presence of oil at a depth of around 5,500 feet and tests yielded from 4-, 500 to 10,000 barrels per day. The thickness of porous oil producing forme.tion is thin as compared with other Middle East fields and consequently it has been thought advisable to limit the target for the 1950 production programme to 1 million tons per year. At the time of my visit good progress had been made in camp construction and one drilling outfit was in the process of being rigged up with the intention of starting to drill in the late summer. a seismic party was operating in Dukhan and obtained results v/hich confirmed the promising character of the structure. Further east a gravity party had found sane indications of favourable conditions on the main peninsula, which will require further investigation in the next vdntcr season, since in the summer climatic conditions arc too severe to permit field work in the desert. In view of the probability that the Dukhan structure may extend southwards across the disputed Qatar-Saudi Arabian frontier I think that consideration should be given to arriving at an early settlement in demarcation of this border. TRUCIAL COAST At the time of my visit all field work on the Trucial Coast had been suspended v/ith the approach of the hot season. During the winter both geological and gravimetrical surveys had been carried out in this difficult terrain and the latter had discovered evidence of a structure running parallel to the coast south of Dubai, which will be surveyed seismically next -winter. It happens that this structure is situated partly in the Sheikdom of Dubai and partly in the Abu Dhabi and the boundary between these two territories is in dispute. If it should be decided that this prospect is sufficiently promising to justify drilling it will be necessary /for- 6 - ) for this boundary to be agreed and defined. In the region south west of the town of Basra the company have been undertaking gravimetric and seismic surveys and have determined the presence of several well defined uplifts, one of which (Zabair) has been selected for drilling. The Basra concessionary obligations provide that at least 12,000 feet of drilling is to be completed annually until oil is struck and a minimum royalty rental of £200,000 gold is payable yearly until oil is exported. If adequate production is available regular export of 1 million tons per year is to start by 1952, Fortunately the prospects in the southern part of the Basra concession, which adjoins the producing areas of Kuwait and Persia, look very premising and the area lias the great advantage of easy access, as well as short distance from seaboard. The early testing of one or more of the aforementioned uplifts is important since the results will assist in the general evaluation of the oil prospects of the entire region. Moreover, ^ should I.P. C. be required to increase production from a new area quickly, ^ I consider that the Basra concession offers the best chance of success, NORTHdPIT IRt».Q In the great Kirkuk field the production of somewhat over If million tons per year was being taken from 10 wells and fills the present pipeline capacity to the Mediterranean (tv/o 12 inch lines to Haifa and Tripoli respectively). The proven reserve of this field is estimated at over 1,000 million tons and it is recognized that production can be readily increased as soon as additional pipeline outlet is provided, v/ork was proceeding on the nev; 16 inch line to Haifa, which it was expected to complete in the spring of 1949. In 1950 it is hoped that a similar line to Tripoli should be in operation and the Kirkuk field could then be produced at a rate of about 12 million tons per year. The drilling of additional wells to provide for this increased production was already far advanced and other facilities were under construction. There are other favourable areas in this vicinity, where exploration drilling is on the programme, /•s MOSUL .AREA, Hh.Q In the Mosul oreathe reserves are about 10 million tons in Ain Zalah and roughly 650 million tons at Qaiyarah and wwasil, Unfortunately the latter consist of heavy very sulphurous oil, which except for road surfacing in Iraq is at present unexploitable. It is too viscous for transportation by pipeline and even if refined at the field the high sulphur content would present technical difficulties. Since the development of these heavy oil reserves are not at present a commercial proposition, the programme in the 'Mosul concession is to exploit the lighter oil which is found in Ain Zalah and which is also expected to be present in some other structures in that neighbourhood* At Ain Zalah several wells were drilled before the war and were subsequently plugged at the instigation of the military authorities, all equipment being removed from the field. Good production was encountered at about 5,500 feet in the western part of the structure. In April a drilling outfit was being installed to exploit this level, the 1953 obligatory production from the Mosul concession being 1 million tons per annum. SYRIA No commercial production was found during the drilling undertaken before the war and generally the chances of finding large fields like those in Northern Iraq and Persia are poor, their being several geological factors which make the oil prospects of most of Syria appear unfavourable. At the / timeI - 7 - ti \ i s f (C( O'*) time of my visit a drilling outfit v/as being rigged up at Baflioun, near the Turkish frontier and this was due to begin drilling in June, Further south at Dolna a camp was being built and preparations were being made to drill a deep test. The drilling of these wells will fulfil the Syrian contractual obligation to drill 9,840 feet per annum. LEBANON In full view of the pipe line terminal at Tripoli and perched high on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean a well site at Terbol has been selected, which will test the oil possibilities of the only known favourable structure in Lebanon, The location was about to be drilled employing a new drilling outfit, which had been manufactured in the United Kingdom. This was the first British drilling rig and outfit to be used in the Middle East and the engineers were enthusiastic as to the high quality and good design of the equipment, PALESTINE Owing to the unsettled political conditions I omitted Palestine from nvy itinerary, but gathered from conversations that preparations were being continued for drilling near Gaza towards the end of this year. Except for Haifa terminal, I.P.C. British staff had left Palestine and the work in the south was being mostly carried out by French nationals, who had been formerly employed in Syria, Lt Haifa I understood that living conditions for I.P.C, staff were difficult. All families had been evacuated and some were residing in temporary quarters in Lebanon, while others had cone home. The bachelors remaining were congregated in a few houses, where they were surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. From here they were escorted to the terminal, which v/as similarly guarded by the military. In speaking to men who had just arrived from Haifa I gathered that the staff there were generally dissatisfied, in particular since some of the families of military personnel had been allowed to remain and also because there v/as no certainty as to when the Jewish problem would be resolved and consequently how long the present uncertainty would continue* In the circumstances it is doubtful whether the company can do anything to improve the conditions under which their Haifa employecs are working. Several departments of the Haifa office, which previously had been I.P. C.’s Middle East headquarters, had moved to Tripoli, v/here it was expected they would remain. ANGLO - EGYPTIAN OILFIELDS LIMITED EGYPT YThile in Egypt I visited the A.E.0. operations, including their main field and the exploration drilling in Sinai. The company was producing oil at an annual rate of about 1*2 million tons which it is expected can be maintained for several years. Production was mostly being taken from the Ras Gharib field, where the oil was being extracted from 95 wells, about 20^) of which v/ero still flowing. There are about 30 locations still left to drill, half of which arc out to sea and to drill thesp, piers and artificial islands are built out on the offshore reefs at a cost of about £10,000 each. From each such island two or more wells can be drilled, some being deflected off the vertical so as to drain parts of the field, that are situated under the sea* In Sinai operations were being conducted jointly by A.E.0. (shell) and Standard Oil of New York. Several wells had been drilled with no success except that oil had been found in one well at Sudr, where until more wells are drilled it is premature to say whether an oilfield of any importance is present. In general there is little likelihood of ary new large fields being discovered in Egypt. (Signed) V.L.F.

No,17 (5/19/49) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, ,, Z f BAHRAIN. 4th March, 1949. Sir, I have the honour to report that on the 28th Februa ry I received a visit from Mr. Funkhouser, the United States Petroleum Attach^, Middle East. I found him very pleasant and anxious to co-operate. He enquired first whether the sta bility of the local oil companies had been affected by the large amount of royalty provided for in some recent concessions. I replied that so far as I was aware their stability had not been affected,, but that the royalty clause in the Bahrain Petroleum Company f s concession was due to come up for revi sion at the beginning of next year and that I had no doubt that the Bahrain Government would demand and expect to re ceive a substantial increase. He asked me whether I had any particular problems relating to the oil companies which I would like to discuss. I mentioned to him the recent visit by Mr. Audsley and said that I was awaiting his report before making up my mind to what extent the oil companies ought to be called upon to contribute more to the social and material progress of the countries in which they are operating than they are doing at present. He replied that he knew that there was much being said and written on this point, but that his own opinion was that the oil companies ought to devote their profits to their own development and that they had no obli gation towards the inhabitants of the countries in which they were operating, outside the ranks of their own employees. Mr. Funkhouser then raised the question of the three Kuwait islands which the American Independent Oil Company assert are covered by their concession for the Kuwait share of the Neutral Zone. I told him that the present position was that the Shaikh of Kuwait maintained that the islands were covered neither by the American Independent Oil Company’s concession nor by that of the Kuwait Oil Company and that further deve lopments were awaited. He went on to say that he presumed that the ownership of the Gulf islands generally would be decided on the basis of the boundaries fixed for the ex ploitation of off-shore oil, roughly in accordance with the map that had been prepared. I replied that this was not the case. I pointed out that Halul which would fall in the Qatar zone was usually regarded as belonging to Abu Dhabi, that Lamb which was on the Persian side of the median line was trea ted as belonging to Ras al Khaimah and that two of the three Kuwait islands which we had previously discussed had long been assigned to Kuwait although they were off the coast of the Neutral Zone. He finally asked for my views about local Anglo-American relations and in particular whether there was undesirable competition between British and American firms. I replied that so far as I was aware there was no more com petition than was natural in the circumstances, but that in some cases a certain amount of jealousy existed within the oil companies between the British and Americans employed by them. 2.

I shall have to comment by despatch to the Foreign Office on this and the other reports I have received from him, and I should be grateful therefore for any observa tions you have to make on the enclosure. Two points come to mind at once viz. that (1) the first sentence of para 5 gives a wrong impression of the extent to which the Shaikh uses the royalties for personal expenditure, and (2) para 7 gives us grounds for informing the Company and the Shaikh that Dickson is no longer acceptable to His Majesty’s Government as Chief Local Represen tative . 2. Audsley has asked me to pass on to the Company so much of the report as I think desirable. Do you see any harm in letting Jordan have a complete copy of the report as it stands ? ■KOBfEI T Dates of visit ^,,2.49 to l c The Sheikhdom of Kuweit lies at the ' h the Persian Oulf and is roughly a square 90 miles ir ; ej, direction. There la ona town, Kuweit, ^ ® r !u e „ CJ oalortty of the people live. Apart iroai this town, the.® ar4 only a few small villages. No near P^i-se figure of the population was available} estimates ‘''i-ulv Arab 85,000 and 150,000. Its population Is much more t,»ul/ A than Bahrain... The Sheikh rules personally with the assistance of members of his family. He Advisers. One of his principal advisers J-^an igyptian. It is an n independent state under British protection . 2o The Kuweit Oil Co* is half Gulf Oil Corporation of America and half Anglo Iranian Oil Co* covers the whole of Kuweit*s territory* Nine wc.-s were drilled between 1938 and 1942 when all operations wer suspended and the wells plugged with cement as a t ^ These wells were re-opened after the war and the .is oommercial crude oil shipments were made on 1st June 19 * There are now wells In production with a dally ayereg output during January 1949 of 220,000 barreis; y of 1950 , there will be 65 wells producing «^ v n ' ,xap ' of. over 4 ? 0 # 000 barrels and if the present industrial develooment plans are completed, there will be 195 P wells by the end of 1953 with a capacity equal to 600,000 to 1 , 000,000 barrels a day* 3 . X have mentioned these figures in this r ®P or |; because they provide the background of the 'orderly chaos that exists today in Kuweit* The rapid Industrial development of the Oil Company has affected the -Li-ves, debits and customs of the people to such an extent that it -s not ea.y to describe in a connected manner the changes that ( h« Vt; occurred and the likely course of future events* Ins following details Impressed me most t % In January 1947, the Company and its contractors employed 19.00 workersj in January this year, ‘mK 0 * Cb) (c) Whereas two years ago, and even a lew menths ago, camels * donkeys and goats ambled along the reads- today there ere hundreds of American cars, I was told that in 1946 there were less than 3JO motor vehicles in Kuweit, and that there are now over 3*500 o In January 1947 there were 236 Indians; today there are over 4,G00« &lt;d&gt; (e) Before the war, the Sheikh's income was measured in tens of thousands; the royalties on 220,000 barrels a day during January 1949 amounted to about £7,000' per day, equal to an income of *-2£ millions a year- Royalty is three rupees, l*®. about 5/-d per ton» In about two years, the annual income will be doubled. The shops are heavily stocked with goods and i was told the merchants are accumulating amazing wealth. Their takings are sc great that many of them do not. trouble to count the cash and take it 'in sacks' to the Banks to be credited to their accounts. •s/fr (f)it may become more benevolent and liberal as circumstances develop and the royalties increase. 7 0 One •other general matter. A Col. -.ickson, a former Political agent i*l Kuweit, acts as liaiscm bet?*een the Sheikh and the Oil Company - by whom he Is paid a salary^ A three hours talk with him gave me the impression tnat he considered himself to be the only person through whom the affairs of the Company should be discussed with the Sheikh* He convinced me of his very keen interest in the 'wellbei.ng of the Arabs but I could not help feeling that some of his outbursts of criticism against the Company were unwise and in my judgement 'illconceived* It occurred to me that U what he said to me was used in discussions with the JheIk** and his chief officials - for example, he mentioned a rather serious conversation he had with the Chief of Police of Kuweit - the Sheikhas attitude to the Company’s affairs, and particularly their scores of difficulties during the expansion period may be adversely affected. .His Influence of course may not be so great as he led me to believe, he is elderly and verbose and his very many years in Kuweit may have encouraged him to exaggerate the place he ough'u to occupy in the determination and application oi the Company s policy* For example, he told me he 'commanded' the ^Sheikh Guards' at the Company’s developing area at Ahmadi„ They were armed v/ith 'carbines' and he was responsible for their 'duties' and the 'guard posts' they should occupy B Yet, the Company had started its o?^n police - security force in the same area 0 'This was the creation of a State within a State and he had told the Police Coramandant to stop lt c It would not be right for me to do i^ore than record my impressions in this report; I did not mention the matter to any Company’s representative 0 The future course of events may provide a solutionc KtIWEIl’ OIL COMPANY . 8 0 * For reasons that will be obvious from the foregoing paragraphs I propose to limit in this report the detailed information I usually give after a first visit to an area.

The general Manager (Mr. Jordan) demurred when I suggested tactfully tnat too much labour and. material had been used in the rapid industrial development and too little in. the provision of reasonable 3iving conditions of the workers engaged upon this development* He pointed out that the Company preferred to go ahead quickly with the building of the new town rather then divert labour and material to temporary structures, and that a rabid inc: ? :; 3 C In he ile^v :.

He has made a start v.tth a course of M«T, Drivers, He endeavoured to secure a class of 16 but so many of those interviewed failed the eyesight test that when I visited the centre only 6 v/ere receiving their initial training. This consisted in learning the English alphabet?. Nearly ail these Arabs are illiterate and progress will be slow but the Instructor is not discouraged. There were no clear plans as to how the centre will develop and this could be understood. As soon as oosslble adequate premises will be provided; at present, training is undertaken in a 3.arge tent and as a sand storm was blowing at the time of my visit, th* conditions can well be understood, SUPPLY OF LAB OUR THROUGH C ONTRACTOR ^. 25- The Company were unfortunately compelled owing to lack of facilities of their own to recruit workers through Labour Contractors or Agents, Although this was a convenient moans to overcome their difficulties, it has been a costly method and has not been without undesirable results. The Agents were created to meet the demands of the Comoany and there was a political flavour about certain of the earlier arrangements for which of course the company were not res possible * 26 coco26o There were three 'Contractors' and their share of the arrangements is described below*- Alahan 1m«a^ktllgdJLflMux \&gt;te±£±°ll - This Agent recruited a considerable number of skilled Iraqis and was given permission to do so by the Sheikh. He paid all the expenses involved in bringing the men to Kuweit, All wages due to the men are paid through his office after authorisation by the Company's pay and ^eges Department and for this he receives a commission of 15% of the monthly amount paid out. In addition he receives 9% Dinars (- £9.10*0) per month of 26 days for each man on his pay roll® At 31i&gt;i2.48 &gt; he was dealing with 790 men. At an average rate of wage of 6 Rso oer day. the over-all rate of payment to him was £106,600 per annum. (Ue* commission and the allowance of 9£ Dinars per men for food etc. « 5 Dinars per month for fuel, food and other related supplies and accommodation and 4^ Dinars to cover Transport expenses to and from Iraq.) The Company relieved of nay responsibility ^ for thes&lt;s men and the arrangement no doubt served the! purpose - including tha making of subs to the men between pay days - but there were frequent complaints by the men’ that they had not received the wages due to the ni 0 Kuwe it Contractin g Com pany These agents provided mainly local men. They receive 12^commission plus 125 Rs 0 per month per men to provide food and accoramodationo They were dealing with 242 at 31ol2 0 43 and, using the average wage rate of 6 Rs,, a day, their yearly rate was £31*400 o Contract ing end _Constructlo£L_Co^Mni These Agents also supplied local avsn but their commission is 12^ and the monthly allowance 120 Ks. They were dealing with 116 men at 31.12.48 and using the average wage rate of 6 Ks. a day, their yearly rate was. £14,647. 27. Based upon the calculations I have described, the 3 contractors have been paid by the Company at the rate ox £152,731 per annum, of which £22,764 was commission, discussed the matter with I&amp;*. Jordan and he agreed that it had been a costly arrangement but stressed that it was unavoidable in the circumstances with which they were faced. Recruiting' through the Agents had ceased.' The Iraqis would all be gone in b months and the workers being dealt with through th* vth'ir two agents would either become redundant to requirements or become direct employees of the company 0 28 „ I have given the foregoing details as an indication of some of the serious difficulties with which the Company have had to dealo 29o They also have an arrangement with 9 Agents to supply dally labour as required - called Bulk Labour. These Agents supply a given number of men each day - not. necessarily the same men - and are paid a flat rate according to the numbers involvedo They pay the men - and there are many complaints by the men that they do not receive the correct rates - and they receive lo/Z commission on the monthly amount received 1 rom the v *&gt; ofrom the Company. As at 31,12*48, there *ere •atlmated to l&gt;« about 4, JOO men engaged on the Company J s work ■ ijrrangementft and assuming an average rate of Rs* 4 per ®&lt;&gt;n t the commission amounted to about £ 30,000 per y e e r * , Jordan realised the cost and risks of abuse of this «sjhod of obtaining daily labour but referred again to his dlfTicui- ties caused by shortage of staff. The matter was being investigated as part of the expansion and reorganisation of the administration and he had no doubt a suitable solution nould be found o I had to leave the matter there. 30 c I vas In close contact with the employees in this Department during my visit. With the ex ^ e P t1 ^. °{. Corbett) all had less than 1 year^ service with the Company and none of them had had any previous practical experience of personnel work or Industrial relations. The ' La ' j ^® r anplied also to the Labour Officers at the various field centres. Nevertheless, X was Impressed by their eagerness and general approach to their activities. Bui the a r newness is a severe handicap to the Company when labour problems of much complexity are arising. There were two strikes during my visit and I was able to give some guidance regarding them. I spoke to Mr. Campbell (Asst. General Manager) and Mr. Jordan on the matter and they realised fully the position but referred again to the rapidity with which .they had had to build up their stc*ff and the difficulties of recruiting more experienced administrators and employees with long experience of Industrial and human relations. It Is certainly a serious problem for the Company and it is to be hoped that no serious labour upheaval will occur while the new employees are gaining knowledge of the work. 1 know Mr, Chisholm the Chief Personnel Manager of the Company in London and will have a talk w-tn him during my forthcoming visit. It is easy to criticise but it is not so easy to find solutions to the problems X have described in this report. CONCLUSION 31* Several less important features into which I enquired have not been mentioned but I hope X have described adequately the essential background of the position ot Kuweit generally and the Oil Company's activities in particular* (SGD) M.T, AUDSUSY CAIRO 2nd April 1949*confidential The Political Agency, Kuwait. t.

There is little doubt that the general prosperity of Kuwait has been shared by the labouring classes. To what extent their share might have been greater had there been a determined effort to Keep the cost of living down is a most complicated question of economics. The Sheikh has always preferred the most free of free economies; and he was only with difficulty persuaded to control prices of essential articles during the war. 'Ve were able to insist on control because these articles were allocated to Kuwait by His Majesty’s Government. Since then controls have progressively been abandoned. Only wheat and occasionally rice are now rationed and sold at controll ed prices. The high price of accommodation constitutes one of the greatest hardships for working people. There is no rent control at all and the Sheikh himself in his private capacity is one of the greatest benificiaries from this. From our point of view all this is very unsatisfactory; but let us examine it from the point of view of the people of Kuwait in the widest sense. Ha^d the cost of living been strictly controlled, the wages bill of the K.O.C and their contractors, and to that extent the national income of Kuwait, would have been considerably less and, with it, ^ Kuwait’s share of the indirect and ancillary benefits aris- « ing from the Oil Company’s operations. Nor is there any reason to suppose that with controlled prices supplies of essential commodities would have been greater - rather might the reverse have been the case. .»Len the greatest single factiwr in the national income ( except income from oil royalties ) arises from wages paid by a foreign Company many of the traditional arguments in favour of a low cost of living and stable wages are undermined. The Kuwaitis’ labour is almost an invisible export earning foreign exchange; and many politically indep endent economists would, I think, consider the present policy of the Sheikh, for whatever reasons adopted, to be in the economic - if not in the human - Interests of his people. There are few Kuwaitis today, of any class, who would put human considerations before the pursuit of money; and there is no doubt at all that the present practice is in the economic interests of the Sheikh himself and of the ricKmen nearest to him. This is almost certainly the decisive factor We are likely to make our views in these matters prevail only to the extent that the Sheikh is dependent on us for s u pp lies • •.

He already controls the prices of grains supplied through us; and* while we are able to give him soft currency, he is comparatively better off for hard currency ( with which soft currency can be bought ) than we are. I shall be addressing you further about the use of soft currency and its effect on the cost of living as soon as the staff position here gives me time to do so. Para, 5 . I agree with your remarks. Para. 6. shall have to take an altogether more effective part that we have in the recent past in the deter mination of the future standards of administration of the State. We shall be called upon increasingly to defend against criticism the use we maice of our influence here. Nobody will believe that our influence is not considerable. It is known to have been so in the past; and it is up to us to see that it does not decline and that we make good use of it. Para. 7 . I do not think we should show this para graph to Jordan. As Chief Local Representative Dickson is not wrong in considering himself to be the person through whom the affairs of the Company should be discussed with the Sheikh. We ourselves are now taking the line that all but routine coimuercial business should be conduct ed through the Chief Local Representative and the Political Agent Instead of direct between the Management and the Sheikh. Audsley seems to have been shocked by Dickson’s talx of the ' Sheixh’s Guards '. What Dickson is reported to have said describes not inaccurately the position at that time. The only thing to which we could take serious objection is Dickson’s having told the Police Commandant to stop the * Creation of a State within a State n ; but the Company themselves acquiesced in its being stopped without considering the matter of sufficient importance to consult us. I agree that Dickson is no longer up to the difficult post of Chief Local Representative; but I thinx any attempt to get rid of him should be based on this fact and not on Audsley’s report. The Company know his deficiencies as well as we do. Nor do I regard Dickson’s removal as a panacea for all the Company’s difficulties with the Sheikh. They go far deeper than that. The taking over of the Company’s V/atch and Ward system is only one symptom of a more general political malaise; other symptoms will appear elsewhere unless we go to the root of the trouble. explained when you were last here the trouble arises from the position of dominance that the Sheikh has acquired over the Directors of the Company in London. It is no idle renark to describe the Shaikh - as Jameson did here two months ago - as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of His (the Sheikh’s) Company. He is, in fact, very nearly that, and the General Manager of the Company here too as far as getting v/hat he wants for himself goes. The malaise will not be cured until we get the Company to work through us and then use our position to confine the Sheikh’s direct relations with the Company to routine commercial business. 1 Para 15 &amp; 16.......Paras* 15 fc 16 , Once we have got the Company to observe the Political'Agreement, I do not thin.&lt; we can accept the Sheikh’s ban on Indians forming associations for joint consultation with the Management. If the Indians and the Management want such consultation, it is up to us t6 try to persuade the SheiKh to permit it. Para 16 subpara(fK The visits referred to are not quarantine visits, for which no fees are levied; but visits to give medical attention to tantcer crews. The Company had stopped their Indian doctors from receiving these fees as they regarded the giving of treatment as part of the wor:&lt; for which the doctors were engaged. The whole question of the treatment of the tamcer crews is receiving the attention of the Quarantine Medical Officer. Para. 17 . The wages are high. What can be bought with them is another matter, already discussed. Paras. 21 &amp; 22 . Whatever may have been the case in the early stages of the development of the Company I am satisfied that Jordan now Keeps the human problems arising out of the Company’s operations very much to the fore in all decisions he has to tarce. Para 24 . The situation described represents only the very beginning^of a training scheme. The tack of training large numbers of Kuwaitis to fill the many posts for sKilled artizans is a gigantic one and will have to be tackled on an altogether more comprehensive scale if adequate results are to be obtained. The Company would be well advised to try to keep ahead of local criticism in this respect; and it is up to us to see that they do so. Pares 25 to 28 . The arrangements described are happily in the process of being terminated. Para 29 . I understand the system described has not yet been eradicated. We shall have to use our influence with the Company to get a more satisfactory system worked out as soon as conditions permit. Para 30. These are difficulties inherent in the creation of any large scale Industrial enterprise almost from scratch, especially during a time of full employment. The Company, too, are worried about the inexperience of which Audsley writes; and I am sure they would remedy it if they could, 3.

PlhbNTIAL 26U/13/49 Sir, I have the honour to submit the following comments on Mr. Audsley's report on his visit to Kuwait in February last, as promised in paragraph 17 of my despatch No.48 (260/11/49) of the 16th June. I have obtained the comments of iir. Jackson, the Political Agent, Kuwait, on the report, but a copy of it has only recently been forwarded to Mr. Jordan, the General Manager, of the Kuwait Oil Company at Kuwait, and I do not expect to receive his comaients for some time. I will forward them as soon as they are received. In what follows I have placed Mr. Jackson’s comments in Inverted commas and where I have given no indication to the contr a ry it may be taken that I agree with them. The references given are to the paragraphs of Mr. Audslay’s report. Paragraph 3 (c) i The term 'Indians” through out the report should be read as including Pakistanis unless there is any indication to the contrary. Paragraphs 3(f) &amp; 4 t 'There is little doubt that the general prosperity of Kuwait has been shared by the labouring classes.

The Shaikh informed roe personally some tiise ago that he was keeping the receipts from royalties in his own nands and allotting lump suras to the various departments of his Govemmunt aa occasion crises. 3o far as I am aware this is still the case. The ICa’crait Civil List i® smaller than the Bahrain one and though the Shaikh is indulging in more ostentation than he used to ho still lives fairly simply. Paragraph C t 'We shall have to take an altoget her ra^re erfecxlva pert that we have in the recent past in th* dotorrojination of the future standards of administration of State, We shall he called upon increasingly to defend against criticism tho use we maito of our influence here. liobody will believe that our influence is not consid erable.

There is no doubt that the Jhaikh does not depend on ns urd seek our ydviee tc the extent ha used to do in the past.

Since I came here, although I was aware that soft currency allotted to merchants here was in some cases being used for imports to Iraq, I have not ordinarily refused soft currency for imports of food because I did not wish to create scarcity, or further to raise the cost of living for working people. 3. Rather have ray efforts been directed to getting essential food bought with soft currency under proper control for rationed distribution - vide ray telegrams No.144 of the 16th June and No.164 of the ' 30th June. At the time the work described in my tele gram No.144 was done I was under the impression that, provided certain precautions were taken, Iranian currency was to be regarded as soft. 4. It has since occurred to me that we could make more impression on the high cost of living for the Company’s labour by tackling the shortage of housing for Arab labour, and possibly by the Company’s making food available to them at reasonable - although not subsidized -prices. 6. I discussed these ideas with Southwell this morning and he has assured me that he had already decided to speed up the building of the Arab village provided for in the Kuwait Oil Company’s town plan; and that he would now endeavour to expedite the opening of Company shons for Arab labour which also formed part of the long-term plan but which had not yet been tackled. 6. This should eventually do something to mitigate the present high cost of living. w Iam m ' H.E.
