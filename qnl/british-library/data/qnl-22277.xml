POLITICALTranslation of a statement made by Ahmed bin Abdulla of Rozbar (Iran), aged 35, taken at Sharjah on 8-1-44. My name is Ahmed bin Abdulla of Rozbar. I was born at Abu Mosa. For the last 8 years I have been working as a watchman at the Colours Company's house at Abu Mosa. In the afternoon of 24th December 1943 a boat 'balam' arrived at Abu Mosa from which about 6 Tankisir men landed and went to the house of Rashid bin Mohammed Abu 'Afreh of Abu Mosa, a neighbour of the house in which the Company's effects have been stored. They drank the coffee with him. They left Rashid's house and transgressed on the Company's house by breaking the gate, entering the house. They took a drill, a file and a number of saws. At that time I was at Shaikh Sultan's cultivation at Abu Mosa. In the evening the Tankisiri men left for Dubai. I wrote a letter to Shaikh Sultan and sent it with Ghaith bin Khalifa of Abu Mosa informing him of what had happened. Ghaith left Abu Mosa on the second day of the incident. On 3rd January 1944 at about 3 o'clock Arabic time in the evening the Tankisiri returned to Abu Mosa and directly went to the Company's house. The broke the store in which the effects have been kept. When the women around the house heard the noise, the came to the town and informed me. At that time I was on my way to buy dates from the town. I appealed to the people for help. +They discussed between them and at last they feared the Tankisiri. They did not agree to go with me. I also got afraid to go alone, because the Tankisiri had arms. When they sailled off I went to the Company's house and found it broken. The following are the articles which have been taken off and which I XKKHgcxixRXK Know:- 1. Six buckets and 3 tubs 2. Three big saws 3. One bath tub 4. Seven gallons oil 5. spanners, spools, iron tools (I do not know \ the number). 6. 16 planks with a tin of black paint. 7. Four tyres and tubes. These are the articles which I know, but I do not know whether more other tilings have been lost. Ahmed bin Abdulla.
