To The Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Memorandum • A preliminary accident report received through the Town Major, Bahrain, shows that at some time between 1900 hours and 1925 hours on Thursday the 15th October 1942 Sergeant Walmsley R.E. had an accident on Belgrave Road, about 100 yards East of Shaikh Salman Road where a trench has been dug part way across the road. The Sergeant was riding a motor-cycle and R.A.F. personnel, who came on the scene shortly after the accident occurred, said that, though the trench was marked with red flags, there were no lighted red lamps there. 2. I suggest that a departmental inquiry be held to ascertain who is responsible for the warning lights not being 3. Will you please let me know the result of the inquiry as soon as it is concluded. lit Political Agent, Bahrain.No. 0 f 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 25th 3hawal, 1361 November 5, 1942. Reference your memorandum No.C/1616 dated the 24th October, 1942, I have now held an enquiry on the circumstances connected with the accident referred to in your letter. 2. A drain was being cut across the Jufair road connec ting the Palace garden on the east side of the road with the new cultivation on the west. At the time of the accident the easternhalf of the road was cut by a ditch, about two feet deep, the remaining half of the road was intact. The iublic iVorhs Department had constructed a barrier on each side oi the open ditch from the edge of the road to the end of the ditch, leaving half of the road open to traffic. The barriers were made of wooden poles. A red lamp was placed on the end of each barrier, in tue centre of the road and these lights were burning when the accident occurred. A Public 7/orks Department watchman was stationed at the barrier. 3. The motor bicycle came up the road from the north, moving fast, the watchman shouted to the rider but with no result. The bicyle crashed into the barrier on the north side, broke the poles, jumped the ditch, crashed the second barrier and came to the ground about 25 - 30 feet beyond the second barrier. One of the lamps was broken by the accident and the other one remained intact. 5. There were present at the time nine labourers employed on the new cultivation and they give evidence that the light were on the barrier when the bicycle ran into it. The light E. B. Li T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:2 were lit from the time that the worlcmen left the site, at sunset. 6. It does not appear to me that there was any lack of precautions to prevent accidents. Two wooden barriers existed both carrying red flags and red lamps at night ' and a watchman was on duty and did in fact try to stop the rider of the bicycle by shouting. 7. The only possible criticism which I can suggest is th^t instead of placing a red light on the end of each barrier, in the centre of the road, two lights might have been put on each barrier, one in the centre and one at the edge. I think however it is reasonable to suggest that any driver seeing one or two red lights in the centre of a road and a barrier draped with red flags on one side should drive on the opposite side of the road and should slow down. 8. I enclose a rough sketch of the si^e of the accident. 9. I should like to state that the Superintendent of the Public V/orks Department and I are extremely sorry that such an accident should have happened.

If the lights had not been lit, Sergeant Walmsley could hardly have avoided an accident. Even it the lights were lit, as is alleged by the Bahraini labourers working in the vicinity, it seems that they were not positioned in the best manner. I think, on the evidence collected, the affair must be regarded as one of those accidents which do happen from time to time and for which the driver of the vehicle involved can be held in no way responsible.

M’s Political Agent, Memorandum : Bahrain Reference your letter No.C/999 dated 29th June 1944, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Station Commander, Bahrain, regarding pilferage of service stores. 2. The suggestion that there should be a fenced- in area^on the customs pier for storage of service stores, guarded by troops does not commend itself to me. It would be difficult and inconvenient to shut off any part pf the pier as this would restrict the area now used/for native craft traffic. 3. The Bahrain Government wishes however to co-operate with the military authorities in all possible ways therefore we would be prepared to reserve an area inside the pier shed for storage of service imports, if the$ service authorities would care to use this. The shed is locked at night and I believe there would be small danger of pilferage from stores which were placed in this building. The stores would be removed from the shed by lorries. 4. In connection with pilferage I am sure that much of the pilferage which occurs take place from the dhows and the barges which are used to convey the goods from ships to shore. During recent months several persons have been convicted in the Bahrain Courts for being in possession of goods which they obtained, unlawfully, from vessels in transit between ships and the harbour. Only today some 30 bags of sugar were seized on a dhow leaving Bahrain which there is every reason to believe were removed from a barge which was unloading sugar in the port. I suggest that if adequate measures were taken by the authorities concerned to safeguard goods in transit between ships and the shore the amount of pilferage would decrease very considerably. Adviser to the GovernmentThe file is with youC*}). This is only a ^opy of a letter addressed to the Customs and sent to us for information.warn(Original on File 28/22) Extract from Po^t Security Intelligence Summary for the perio_d endim Slat July 1944 1• GEKKRAL On the 15th July a r»onferen^e was held to discuss the prevention of pilferage of W.D. cargoes. The following points were brought to notice (a) The need for early information of arrival of a consignment, so that a guard may be arranged. For t£is the routine of discharge of the 'Resnng' must be known. (b) The system of guards ordered by the Station Commander was explained, The guard goes out to the ship, one man accompanies each lighterashore, and the guard reforms on the jetty. Stores are put into a corner allotted in the '■’ustoms shed. (b) The need for avoiding the use of hooks on bags was brought out. (d) Gray Mackenzie agreed that the ,r Resang M could be held up for one hour to await the arrival of a guard, should it be delayed. (e) The advantages of a Docks Operating Section were also discussed. (f) Gray Mackenzie have suggested that some hsr of the shortage might be due to bad tally. They suggest a permanent tally staff on the ,r Resang ,f • (g) The p6int was brought out that the 'Resang' visits BQshire and Sharjah before discharging at Bahrain, and that the coolies work in holds at these places. 2. ^OOLIE CONTROL A system of discs for coolies has been put into operation. A report will be rendered when it is observed how the system works. XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX /Director of Customs, £ A H K ia I *»» _ £«4 £xAU.'XOxt OUkkcUiu^ £,-ihi.tJ.U &amp;/S-5Q*/£2- ^ 2 .

I admit the experiment has only been tried once but the above factors are constant. 4 . X request therefore that consideration again be given to my original request that in periods when the any are unloading stores a portion of the of the pier be reserved to Station Command* 5 , The periods for which this would be required would be for about 3 days every 4 weeks* I 6 * ^n order that no daiua^e would be done to your pier i would arrange that a ortable obstacle be made use of to protect stores whilst on the pier* 7 , The idea that the stores would be landed at the end of the pier and sent by truck to the customs shed is not practicable from a man ppwer point of view as regards provision of the necessary escorts* d.
