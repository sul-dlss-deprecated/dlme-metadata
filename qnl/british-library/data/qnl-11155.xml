B. 295 A A HANDBOOK OF MESOPOTAMIA CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS TO VOLUME III CENTRAL MESOPOTAMIA WITH SOUTHERN KURDISTAN AND THE SYRIAN DESERT Prepared on behalf of the Admiralty and the War Office June, 1918 naval staff intelligence departmentNOTE The third volume of the Handbook of Mesopotamia includes routes along the middle Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad and Fellujeh up to Mosul and Meskeneh, in the area between the rivers from Baghdad northwards to the Jebel Sinjar, in the country east of the middle Tigris towards the Persian frontier, and in the Syrian Desert west of the middle Euphrates. The present Additions and Corrections are based partly on information dating from before the war, partly on recent intelligence (principally of 1917 and the first months of 1918). For the routes in the neighbourhood of the Persian frontier some Kussian informa tion has been used ; most of it dates from before the war. Further information on the line Mosul—Deir ez-Zor (Routes 49 a-d in Vol. Ill of the HandhooJc) will be given in Additions and Corrections to Vol. IV. All estimates of mileage must be considered as approximate only. In most cases they are based on the rough calculations of travellers, or on times given by travellers, or on sketch-maps or incomplete surveys. The question-marks placed beside some of the figures indicate that these are peculiarly doubtful; it is not implied that other figures may be regarded as exact. It is necessary to emphasize the fact that in the circumstances the information given cannot be complete and that conditions are con stantly undergoing change. The Admiralty will be glad to receive further corrections and additions. The back of each page of text has been left blank for convenience of use with interleaved copies of the original edition. a 2ABBEEVIATIO^S In the itineraries the following abbreviations and conventional signs may be noted :— r. = right. 1. = left. h.w. = high water, l.vv. — low water.

C. Maps 86 A, 90 A, 96 A, 116 (1917); other information, 1917. The River.—As to depths there is no satisfactory information available. In the neighbourhood of the islands between m. 82 and m. 95 depths decline in places to 3 or 4 ft. when the river is low; see on the fords hereabouts additions to Route 25 b. See further below, under Navigation. The bed of the Tigris from Baghdad up to the neighbourhood of the 'Adheim mouth (about m. 71) is alluvium. Among the islands between m. 82 and m. 95 it is shingle, sand, or rock ; from about m. 95 to Samarra it is shingle, sand, clay, or rock. The width of the river varies very considerably. Where it flows in a single channel its breadth seems to be usually 300-500 yds. But in places, and especially from the neighbourhood of Beled to near Samarra, it splits into several channels enclosing banks which are submerged in the flood season or islands which are permanently above water, though liable to alteration by the annual floods; in such places the river may be -f-lf m. wide from bank to bank. Opposite Samarra it narrows to about 180 yds. The islands mentioned above are said to be much subject to altera tion by the annual floods. JVavigaHon. —When the river is high its navigation from Baghdad up to ' Baheirdeh' Island (m. 82) seems to present no special diffi culties for vessels drawing up to 4 ft. Near the islands (m. 82-m. 95) navigation is troublesome. MES. Ill ADD. a10 RIVER ROUTES In March 1917 Turkish steamers passed up to and above Samarra (see further corrections to Route III E, introduction). Steam-launches or motor-boats could probably navigate up to Samarra throughout the year. Native sailing-boats {saftnelis) of 8 tons can ascend to Samarra during the greater part of the year; but at the height of the flood season it might be impossible for them to make head against the current, and in low water they would need portage at places. Traffic on this section of the river has been mainly carried on by rafts {lielelis] navigating down-stream only. Adverse winds may make the heleh journey very slow (4 days or more). In high flood, without an adverse wind, the journey may take only 13-14 hrs. In fair weather rafts can travel all night. Coracles {quffehs) are used locally as ferry-boats and for down-stream journeys. Banks. —Adequate information is not available. From Baghdad to the neighbourhood of Sa'diyeh (m. 48^) and Sindiyeh (m. 54^) the alluvial plains on either side of the Tigris are below the high flood-level of the river. The banks are bunded. If in flood-time the bunds are breached between Baghdad and El-Howeish on the 1. bank (m. 37^) or a point in Meshahidiyeh tract on the r. bank (about m. 24-m. 27), the neighbourhood of Baghdad may be flooded. Spills which occur farther up-stream are reported not to reach as far as Baghdad. Between Sindiyeh (m. 54^) and the head of the Dujeil canal Bight Bank Baghdad.

The high banks of the old Nahrawan and El-Qa'im canal-beds are close to the 1. bank in parts of this stretch of the river. Above the head of the Dujeil canal the Tigris flows in a valley 2-3 m. wide, on either side of which the ground rises sharply 30-50 ft. to slightly undulating plateaux. Inhabitants. —Arabs of various tribes, partly settled, partly nomadic or semi-nomadic. Along the right bank the following are mentioned: Meshahideh in the Meshahidiyeh tract and the adjoining districts, Beni Tamlm in the Husai and Zambur districts, A1 Bu Hayyazeh (apparently a section of the c Obeid) in the_ Sufeil neighbourhood, Azzeh about opposite the 'Adheim mouth, A1 Bu Handhal at Es-Seflneh, A1 Bu Daraj and Mujamma' between Es-Seflneh and the Dujeil, A1 Bu Nisan round Tineh. TheKhasraj are found at Sumeikeh; and in the country round, besides the Mujamma', there are Muqadmeh, Jumeileh, and other small tribes. In the desert to west are Dilaim and ShammHr. The Arabs on the right bank are mostly Sunnis. On the left bank are found Jebur, Juheish, Beni Tamlm at and near Sindiyeh, A1 Bu Hayyazeh at Dojmeh, Azzeh astride the Adheim.

In high flood the minimum depth is 12 ft., but it is reported that nothing but a small motor-launch could then ascend the rivet owing to the sharp turns combined with a rapid current. Saflnfki can navigate to Baqubeh in the h. w. season. In the 1. w. season the Diyaleh is not navigable, as almost all the water of the river is diverted to irrigation higher up-stream (e. g. into the Khalis, Beledruz, and Khorasan canals). On the section of the river between its mouth and Baqtxbeh the lower reaches are shallower than the upper owing to the loss of water by irrigation. The average width of the river is about 100 yds. (minimum 55 yds. ; maximum 150 yds.). In March 1917 its current was 3 m. p. h. increasing to 4 m. p. h. at Baqubeh. The river is more tortuous than it is represented on maps I. D. 2( and T.

According to the condition of the river and the wind, they make their journeys at rates varying from an average of about 55 miles a day (in high water without adverse winds) to an average of about 10 or 12 miles a day (in low water).

South of the Jebel Hamrrn the surface of the country along the route consists mainly of the alluvial loam of Irak, with sand in places: north of the Hamrln it is for the most part alluvial clay, with sand and gravel here and there.

At about 8 m. from the point where it leaves44 LAND ROUTES the main route it turns into the Hamrln hills and reaches a large walled enclosure. This appears to be Ain Lailah. It is reported that at 'Ain Lailah there is a spring with brackish but drinkable water estimated as sufficient for at least a division. In the stream from this spring are several deep pools. According to Arab information there is a spring of sweet water about 4 m. farther NW. Before reaching 'Ain Lailah some rock -blasting would be necessary (for wheels ?), and there are some patches of sand. There are no steep gradients. From 'Ain Lailah to the valley of the Nahrin Su there is a road which has a good surface ; but levelling would be needed here for motor traffic. At the bottom of the foothills, about 7 m. SW. of Qara Tepeh, the road divides into three branches which cross the Nahrin Su by the Mohammed Saran ford (4| m. SW. of Qara Tepeh), the Arab el-Jassim ford (said to be 2 m.

J he bed of the Nahrin Su is described as being (apparently in this neighbourhood) about 30 yds. wide from bank to bank, and containing a stream 12 ft. wide and 1 ft. deep (December?). The bottom is sand and shingle. The banks are generally steep and about 6 ft. high, but there are many places where guns could ford. The water of the stream is drinkable but brackish.

(In July 1917 there was said to be another bridge 2 hrs. up-stream of Quweir, which was believed to be strong enough to carry guns.) From Quweir the route runs via Qaraqush (about 61 in.) to Mosul (about 76 m.). The first 18 m. from Altun Koprii appear to be fit for wheels. Then the road degenerates into a pack-track, and beyond m. 24 it is generally bad, with steep ascents and descents, as far as the Great Zab. Shortly beyond the crossing of the river it improves again and remains fit for wheels as far as Mosul.

MES. Ill ADD.50 LAND KOUTES Note on Fords across the Tigris between Beled and Tekkit The following fords were reported in June 1917 to be passable in low water. At the beginning of August 1917 they were still im practicable ; it was thought that the Sabiyeh ford (c) would be the first to become passable. Conditions are liable to change more or less from year to year. On the fords described in detail below (a-d) there are no pitfalls ; they are not formed by ledges, and they are believed to extend at least 200 yds. up and down-stream of the points indicated : (a) Qadriyeh Ford. About 25 m. down-stream of Samarra, opposite Biharir ('Baheirdeh' or ' Bihairdah') I. See corrections to Route III D, m. 82-m. 82^ The ford is 50 yds. S. of a water-lift (apparently at its r.-bank end). On June 5, 1917, the channel betAveen the island and the r. bank of the river was out of a man's depth at a point 50 yds. from the bank. The l.-bank channel, which is the main one, was deeper. It was believed that under normal conditions the latter channel might have a maximum depth of 3-3i ft. early in July, but the ford was not passable at the beginning of August 1917. The banks (r. bank ?) are 10 ft. high with a slope of 1 in 1 and a small beach below. The ford leads from the r. bank to a small spit directly opposite and thence half-right to El-Shadawiyeh (T. C. Map 92 A). The island marked ' Bihairdah on T. C. Map (locally known as Biharir at this (the southern) end and Umm Talaib at its northern end) is crossed. In June the current was 1-| m. p. h. in the r.-bank channel, much faster in the l.-bank. (&amp;) Aziz Beled Ford. About 22 m. down-stream of Samara opposite Tutha I. and about ^ m. above Ba'rurah on the 1. bank. See corrections to Route III D, m. 85^. The position of the ford is marked by a group of water-lifts and 3 small-walled gardens. The approach on the r. bank leads through irrigation-cuts and cultivation. The ford was still impassable at the beginning of August. The l.-bank channel is the deeper. ' :)an ks (r. bank?) are 12 ft. high with slopes of 1 in 1, and o or 4 ramps for animals. The direction of the ford is uncertain, but it is stated that the general rule of going diagonally from spit to spit appeared to hold. Ineie is a r.-bank island called Sinjar Jawaziret and a l.-bankEOUTE 25 b 5j island called Sheikh A1 Bn Faraj. These may be the islands marked on T. C. Map 92 A as lying respectively in the southern and northern channels past Tutha I. The ford has a hard bottom consisting partly of sand, partly of pebbles. In June the current was 1^ m. p. h. in the r.-bank channel faster in the l.-bank. (c) Sabiyeh Ford. Near Sabiyeh ruins, about 20 m. down-stream of Samarra, apparently opposite the lower end of Darawish I. See corrections to Route III D, m. 87|-m. 88. The ford was not practicable at the beginning of August 1917 when there was a maximum depth here of 7 ft. ; but it was believed that it would probably become passable sooner than the other fords in this neighbourhood. It is said to be about girth-high when practicable, the l.-bank channel being the deeper. The banks (r. bank?) are about 5^ft. high and are sloped in places so as to be fit for pack-animals. The ford leads from the r. bank straight to Jawaziret (Darawish?) I., then up the island to a clump of trees, and thence across l.-bank channel towards Imam Sheikh Hasan. There is a good bottom of sand and shingle. The current is moderate. (d) Jibbareh Ford. About 15 m. down-stream of Samarra. See corrections to Itoute III D, m. 92^. The position of the ford is marked on the r. bank by two brick pump-houses and some larger buildings. On the 1. bank, opposite, is Khan Sawiyeh (Khan Saurah or Khan Mizraqchi ? See corrections to Bonte III D, m. 92-m. 92^). This ford was not passable at the beginning of August 1917, though it had been expected that it would be girth-high at the end of June. The banks (r. bank?) are 15 ft. high, with steep slopes. Between the two pump-houses is a ramp suitable for pack-horses. The ford starts from a point on the r. bank near a water-lift close to the down-stream pump-house. It leads across a channel likely to dry early in the 1. w. season, then down a sand-bank to opposite a water-lift, and thence straight across the main river to Teha I., and from there across a side-channel to the 1. bank. The bottom is sand. (e) Tineh Ford. See corrections to Route III D, m. 104-|. (/) Mukeshefeh Ford. About 13 m. above Samarra. See cor rections to Route III E, m. 14. {g) Tel el-Mohaijir Ford.

Note on the 'Adheim The lower 'Adheim is dry in summer, the water which would otherwise go to feed it being diverted to irrigation above the Hamrin hills. At this time water can generally be found below its bed at a depth of 2 ft. The pools which form in the river-bed as it dries are said to be unfit to drink by the end of May. In high water the 'Adheim is 30-50 yds. wide in the neighbourhood of its mouth and apparently is generally fordable. Thus on March 29, 1917, there was a ford about 6 m. from the Tigris where the river was 40-50 yds. wide, the water being waist-high and the bottom muddy. In the middle of April 1917 the river near its mouth was 30 yds. wide and fordable, but the Turks had a bridge about 1^ m. from its confluence with the Tigris. A depth of 4 ft. has been found at or near the mouth of the 'Adheim in December. Motor-transport can pass from the 'Adheim mouth up to Banel-i- 'Adheim by keeping 2-3 m. E. of the river. ROUTE 26, p. 179 TEKRIT—KIRKUK m. 22. Inkhila (AinNukheileh). In November 1917 it was reported that a road was under construction between this place and Fethah 'apparently following the southern slopes of the Jebel Hamrin '. The distance from 'Inkhila'to Fethah is perhaps about 25 m. Dur—Taza Khurmatli A German report of 1917 gives a route between Dur on the Tigris, 20 m. above Samarra, and Taza Khurmatli, 12 m. S. of Kirkuk on the Baghdad road {Boute 25 a, m. 176). This route crosses the Jebel Hamrln at an unnamed point, and passes by Hayari (unlocated) and Bashiriyeh (25 m.

Baqubeh. There is said to be a large oil-refinery at Baqubeh, with an output of 200 tons (? per month). The loss on refinement is about 10 per cent. A road passable for wheels runs from Baqubeh to Beledruz via Jodeideh (10 m.), where it apparently joins Route 30 (see corrections to that route). A report of July 1917 stated that the bridge near Jellali was then broken. The canal was believed to be fordable at that time. The canal mentioned under this mileage seems to be the Haruniyeh, which according to the most recent map is a little over 4 m. from Shahraban. In 1917 the bridge was said to be of brick and in good repair. The 'sluggish river' mentioned in the text as being just beyond the canal is probably the Beledruz Canal, said to be 30 yds. wide by 30-40 ft. deep and crossed by a timber suspension-bridge fit for guns but not for lorries. [About 2^ m. beyond the Beledruz Canal a road passable for all arms turns S., running parallel to and generally about 1 m. distant from the canal. Tel Qubbeh is passed at 12 m. After Imam Askar (about 20 m.) the surface is spongy owing to this country being under rice-cultivation. Beledruz is reached at about 26^ m.54 LAND EOITTES Water is fairly plentiful along this road even in the driest months.

A road is reported to run from Qizil Ribat to Qara Tepeh (see Route 25 a, m. 95). At the Diyaleh crossing on this road the Turks constructed a trestle bridge.

Paragraphs in small type.—Add : 'There are several oil- . springs at Imam Hasan, with an output of 1,000 gals, of crude oil per month. The oil contains a light proportion of sulphur'. ROUTE 28 b, pp. 194-205 BAGHDAD—KIRMAN-SHAH Via Mandali m. 73. Mandali. There is a telegraph office at Mandali. Apparently there is also an oil-refinery. The oil is said to be of fair quality. Three stills were reported to be working in the summer of 1917. About 20 m. NNE. of Mandali there are about 20 oil-springs. In 1917 the output was 500 gals, of crude oil per day, an amount which could be doubled. The specific gravity of the oil is about 0-900. It contains much sulphur and has 8 per cent, of commercial benzines with a fair proportion of heavy petrols. It requires to be tanked immediately on exit from the springs. There are tanks under the springs holding 8,000 gals. There is probably sufficient water on the spot for a small refinery, which would require to be at the springs in order to retain light products. For exploitation, sulphuric acid washers, agitators, caustic soda tanks, and facilities for preparing the oils for motor works are required. [The first 20 m. of a road from Mandali to Qizil Ribat were reconnoitred in the autumn of 1917. The going was good for motors except at m. 9, where a water-channel crosses the route, and at about m. 17, where the Ab-i-NeftROUTE 28 b 55 is crossed Half an hour's ramping would be required to allow motors to pass these points. At ^ Mandali ? near Khaizaran, there is a well to W. of the road, where a plentiful supply of good water could be obtained about 6 in. below the surface. The water in the Ab-i-Neft is slightly brackish where the road crosses. Higher up-stream it is sweet. Grazing is ffood in the winter months. 1 Add: ROUTE 29, pp. 205-206 MANDALI—KHANIKIN (a) The following account of the route is taken from a report based on account of June 1917 and Arab information of 1915-1917: Total distance 44 m. Introduction. —The road is passable for all arms, except possibly in the rainy season. Between Kani Masi and Khanikin it would need some improvement for motors. A Turkish cavalry brigade of 600 sabres with wheeled transport passed over the route in May 1916. From the middle of January to the end of May water is plentiful, and in the driest months there is believed to be enough water along the route for 3,000 infantry with transport; but the supply, except in the Oangir river at Mandali and the Alvand river at Khanikin, is brackish. (The water on the route Jessan—Khanikin via Mandali is described generally as resembling Harrogate water, but much stronger, causing no harm or disease but tasting of rotten eggs and fit for troops only in case of absolute necessity ; see, however, under m. 18 and m. 26 below.) There is irrigation from the streams issuing from the Persian hills, and in peace time wheat and barley were exported to Baghdad and ghi was plentiful. The crops from Mandali to Khanikin failed in 1917, by reason, it is believed, of unsettled conditions. There is good camel-grazing throughout, and grazing for other animals from January to March inclusive. There is a certain amount of brushwood along the route, and fire wood is reported to be obtainable in the hills. Camels might be purchased (the estimated number obtainable between Bedrah and Khanikin is 5,000). There is ample space for camping throughout.56 LAND ROUTES 44 Mandali.

In 1917 the Diyaleh between Qal'ah Shirwan and the Jebel Hamrln was fordable in many places from the last week in April to the middle of December. In low water the river breaks up into' a number of small channels. Compare Boute 32 b, under m. 25.

On the E. side of the range is a considerable village called (by Soane) Qara Dagh, the head-quarters of a mudir. It lies somewhat S. of the road, about 22 m. from Sulei maniyeh.

Snleimaniyeh—Mohun. Soane's estimate of distance for this stage is 20 m. (7 hrs.). W. 0. Map (E. T. A. series, sheet 36) makes the distance about 23 m. Soane's description of the stage agrees in general with that in the text. The road goes up and down over the spurs of the hills to 1., passing a few villages in the folds. The first of these villages, Karga, is a large place. The road has very steep ascents and descents for some miles, taking an almost straight course till it passes Nil Pariz, 'a large village with a little water.' On Soane's map Nil Pariz is placed not quite half-way between Suleimaniyeh and Mohun.62 LAND KOUTES (According to Soane the older road kept the lowest level of the valley, near the river, but fell into disuse owino- to Hamawand raids. But the upper road was apparently in use in 1886 and the bottom of the valley (which is described as damp by the authority of 1886) may be heavy going.) From the top of the last rise before Mohun a wide view is obtained over the Shahrizur plain, and Halebjeh can be seen (to SE.) on high ground under the Kuh-i-Nilabu. m, 25. Mohun. Soane, Muan.

In May and October the Jaf Kurds are on the move in this neighbourhood, m. 25-m. 45. Mohun—Halebjeh. Soane's estimate of distance on this stage is 17 m. (6 hrs.); W. O. Map makes it about 15 m. According to Soane the only obstacles on this stage are two considerable streams, the Ao-i-Shahrizur and the Baishan or Ao-i-Mahmud, which are deep in spring. It is possible that these are the streams mentioned under m. o7 in the text. If so, the road followed in 1886 apparently crosses them near their junction. Soane's map places them nearer Mohun (Moan) and makes the road cross the Ao-i-Shahrizur at about 3 m. from Mohun and the Baishan about 4 m. farther on. He states that the second of these streams is near the lowest point crossed by the road,^ which then rises to Halebjeh. m. 45. Halebjeh.

It crosses the Gawaru by a ford and ascends a hill-side to Palangan. Palangfan. The stage to this place from Tavala is reckoned at 10 hrs. owing to the difficulty of the way. Palangan is a decayed village, but the country round is fertile, and villages and gardens are passed on the road. Water is plentiful.

From Juanrud to Ruvansar the general direction is ESE. In this stage the road is good and passable for all arms. It runs over undulating ground (chains of hillocks and low hills) for the first 10 m., and then over a level plain. High hills are visible in the distance.

The distance given in the text between Sheikh 'Attar and Duvizeh (42 m.) may be due to an over-estimate caused by slow going on the steep hills beyond Barudar. The distance between Duvizeh and Senna is estimated at 11 m. in Routes in Persia, vol. ii, no. 86 a. ROUTE 36 b, pp. 239 -240 SULEIMANIYEH—PEN.TE V1N Via Harmaleh Introduction.—Add : 1 (a) Soane's Route. The route from Suleimaniyeh to Penjevin described by Soane {Report on Sulaimania District, 1910) seems to follow more or less the same line as Route 36 b, though it is impossible to say exactly how far it differs from, or is identical with, the route described in the text. Both Route 36 b and Soane's route make less of a detour to N. than Route 36 a. (According to Soane there is no passage for caravans leading direct from Suleimaniyeh to Penjevin.) Soane's route is as follows : Total distance 33 m. in two stages. The end of the first caravan- stage is variable. In the months March-July, when grazing is obtainable, caravans often halt at the foot of the last pass before Penjevin. At other times a break is made near an encampment or village. From the ascent of the Azmir range NE. of Suleimaniyeh to the point where the route strikes the BimUnsu valley the road was difficult in 1910, being described by Soane as ' one of the severest near Suleimaniyeh . But see (6) below. Water from springs. The road leaves the NE. end of Suleimaniyeh in a general NE. direction. It passes through Karga and ascends steeply to cross the neck in the hills above that village. It then goes up and down passing ' the ravines at the head of the Azmir mountain system . The road is stony and difficult. There are a few villages on the r. depending for their water-supply on the drainage from1 ,110,83, the spurs. (According to Soane's map his route passes through U ft Changaina, which is apparently Chingina of Routes of Persia'. See a D uti ^ i corrections to Route 36 a, m. 8-m. 12^-, and (&amp;) below.) About 12 m. from Penjeyin there is a neck, and a stiff ascent and descent leading ill Attar % Ao-i-Penjevin (i. e. apparently the BimansQ ; compare Route 36 a).

At least as far as Syurela this is passable for native carts.

ROUTE 37, pp. 241-246 KIRKUK—SULEIMANIYEH Introduction.—A dd: (a) Condition of the road. Before the war arabas could apparently go with difficulty from Kirkuk to &amp;uleim3niyeh, though they may not have followed the ordinary road used by pack-caravans. The worst places on this road seem to have been (i) in the first 15 miles from Kirkuk, (ii) at e P ass over the range on the E. side of the Baziyan vallev. Compare F and G below and C in text.70 LAND EOUTES From 1914 to the autumn of 1917 it would appear that pack- transport was used on this route. Thus the German detachment which marched from Mosul to Suleimaniyeh in 1916, having used four-horse vehicles for its transport as far as Kirkuk, employed mule- transport from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh. It was reported in 1917 that the road from Kirkuk to Suleimaniyeh was expected to be made fit for wheels by about the end of October, In May 1918 it was reported passable for wheels. The Baziyan defile is only just wide enough for two (mule ?) caravans to pass. The Khanjiru or Bakhan, if unbridged, may be a serious obstacle in spring and until May. (6) Water. (Compare p. 242 in text, 2nd paragraph.) It appears that on the route described by Soane (F below) water is scarce between Kirkuk and Chemchemal, is obtainable in the Baziyan valley, and is moderately plentiful in the Suleimaniyeh plain. (c) Villages. According to Soane (1910) the only villages on the road between Chemchemal and Suleimaniyeh are Baba Merda and a small village near the Khanjiru (Bakhan) stream ; and these are deserted from early April to November, the inhabitants moving away to pasture their flocks. Encampments of Hamawand are to be found on both sides of the road in the Baziyan valley, or in the plain W. of Baba Merda, at certain seasons of the year, and particularly in spring and early summer, Hony marks a number of places on or near this part of the road (see additions to D below). But it is uncertain whether all of these are permanent villages. There is the same uncertainty with regard to the localities mentioned in the Russian report (Gr below). (A), pp. 242-243. m. 41. For Deir Gezin read Dergazin. m. 50. 'The road crosses the hills by an easy pass.'

Between Kirkuk and Chemchemal this road seems to follow more or less the course taken by Route C in text. Miles from Kirkuk Kirkuk. The road mounts steadily till it reaches the ranges above Gachi (the Gach Dagh, apparently the Jebel Mekran of C). Here it winds in and out among mounds and descends on the other side to Chemchemal. The road to Chemchemal is described as ' easy but tediousIn the first 15 m. from Kirkuk it crosses stone ridges ' which form a series of steps on which the plain risesThese ridges ' worn into deep holes by the animals or broken in layers require very careful negotiation and seriously hinder progress. The time taken by caravans from Kirkuk to Chemchemal is ' quite 12 and usually 14 hrs.'.

From here the track crosses the Chem chemal plain, which consists of a confused mass of hum mocks and low hills, all of about the same height, and therefore presenting at a distance the appearance of a flat surface. From above Chemchemal the Baziyan Pass is conspicuous; it is a V-shaped break in the wall of the Qara Dagh range. There is a considerable ascent to the base of the break, which is just wide enough for two 3070 trc ROUTE 37 73 Miles from Xirkuk 43 71 caravans to pass.

It is also stated that there is water on the road 3 m. E. of the pass. From the pass the road turns SE. and crosses the Baziyan valley. Hamawand encampments near the road, especi ally in spring and early summer. The road crosses the range on the NE. side of the valley by the pass of Baba Merda. This pass is only a way over the top of the range, which is here slightly broken. The ascent and descent are extremely stony and troublesome to mules and horses. From the summit the range E. of Suleimaniyeh is visible, and the position of Suleimaniyeh is indicated by a white streak on- the side of that range— the road from Suleimaniyeh to Penjevin. From the pass the road, flat and stoneless, leads across a plain, where in spring and early summer Hamawand encampments may be found, to Baba Merda village, where there is good water. From here to Suleimaniyeh undulating country (known as Surchina, or Red Hillocks) is crossed. From the foot of the pass to ■ Suleimaniyeh the only ob stacles are two streams, one before Baba Merda, which in spring is girth-high, and the other the Bakhan (or Khanjiru), which is deep and swift in May and has a bad approach from the W. The ford across the Khanjiru is below the ruined bridge in spring and above it in summer and autumn. [Hony shows the road as crossing 4 streams between the pass and Suleimaniyeh : (a) at 3 m. WNW. of Baba Merda and about 12 m. from Suleimaniyeh ; (&amp;) at Baba Merda (the village being placed on the r. (W.) bank of this stream); (c) at about 3 m.

On the other hand, according to a Russian report, a road from Baba Chichek to Rowanduz was actually built in January 1917, and from the information received by the Russians up to June 1, 1917, it appeared that transport by native carts (arabas) had become possible between Erbil and Rowanduz.' m. 63.

Fellujeh—Hit. There is a road from Fellujeh to Hit on the JezTreh side of the river. As far as Saqlawi- yeh the road is good and fit for motors, but liable to be flooded in spring. From Saqlawiyeh the road runs W. to the canal and is fit for motor traffic in part at least, though the ground is much intersected by irrigation-cuts. After crossing the canal the route traverses undulating desert, keeping sufficiently far inland to avoid the low ground. There is a camping-ground opposite Ramndiyeh, beyond which the road again bends inland over desert higher and more broken than that previously crossed, descending to the river again rather over 20 m. below Hit. The road here is good. Shortly afterwards it again strikes across the desert and returns to the river about 4 m. below Hit. m. 45. Between this entry and the next insert:86 LAND ROUTES ' m. 46.

Add the following : (i*) Baghdad—Tel Afar via the Wadi Tartar Authority: —Arab information '(account of a journey in 1917), The Wadi Tartar is said to have contained much more water ten years ago than it does now. Its source is a spring near Beled Sinjar. The inhabitants of that neighbourhood have dammed the N. end of the wadi in order to use its water for irrigation. Down stream of the dam there is water in the wadi during the winter months only; but there is a series of brackish wells along its course. There are wells at all the localities mentioned below from Abu Khashab onwards. From W. of Tekrit northwards the sides of the Wadi Tartar are reported to be cliffs some 30 ft. high. Crow-fly distance from Abu Khashab, where the Wadi Tartar was struck, to Tel A'far, 130 or 140 m. The actual distance covered was increased to nearly 200 m. by the windings of the wadi, whose series of salty wells had to be followed. Total marching time from Abu Khashab, 59 hrs.

This route is said to follow a winding track, particularly difficult for wheels between m. 25 and m. 37, but according to one report (June 1917) the desert is passable for all arms and for motor-lorries. Distances given below are probably more or less unreliable. Water is not plentiful. It is said that there are wells about every 16 m., but it is doubtful how near this may be to the truth. The capacity of the wells is not large, but water could be obtained by digging, which would be rather heavy work. The supply of water at the Turkish posts is variously described as ' fairly good' and 1 brackish and scarcely drinkable '. Fuel: reported to be plentiful ; apparently scrub. Grazing: none, according to a report of 1917 ; in 1886 a good deal of yellow bent grass was found along the route. The following account is given of the posts established by the Turks between Hit and Tekrit: From report of July 1917. Four posts: 1. At m. 25 from Hit.

There is said to be a considerable traffic from the Wadi Tartar to Tekrit, Kamadiyeh, Hit, Anah, and Deir ez-Zor, and there is an important salt-deposit 30-35 m. SW. of El-Hadhr. The latter comprises three lakes fairly close together, the largest of which is called Ashkar. Tracks appear to run from El-Hadhr past these lakes, possibly to Anah and Meyyadln. The direct track El-Hadhr—Tel es-Sawwar has already been referred to (see corrections to Route 50 (ii) above), and this may possibly be mainly a ' salt road ', there being two salt-lakes on the route, viz. Umm Midhyabeh and El- c Aseleh (see p. 98 above). The El-Edejd deposit has also been spoken of (see above, p. 102). This bed appears also to be called Sabaa. Another bed, called Bevara, lies ENE. of Meyyadln, about 41° 8'E. and 35 0 13 / N. It is about 7^ m. long and m. broad, and in the middle of it is a small island. To N. is a rocky chain of (basalt ?) hills called Er-Roda or Er-Rada, a name which appears to be given also to the lake. The Bevara bed does not lie on any caravan-track, and the nearest drinking-water is said to be 2 hrs. farther E. (or 12 hrs. according to one account). It is also stated, however, that wells have been sunk in the Er-Roda ridge.104 THE SYRIAN DESERT ROUTE 51, pp. 324-325 HIT—RAHALlYEH m. 0. For 'JRaha-liyeh ' read ' Rahaliyeh m. 40.

A ruin called Khan el-Abyadh is passed at about 18 m. (rather over 5 hrs.) from Qaryatein, and at about 35 m. (9-10 hrs.) the village of Nasirlyeh is reached. The village is built of about 50 stone houses and lies in the middle of the valley. There is practically no vegetation here. The village owes its existence to the exploitation by the Turkish Government of the dry salt-lake at the foot of the hills to SE. A traveller in 1905 saw trial sinkings for water, but does not state if the attempt to find water had been successful. Orchards and gardens begin shortly after Nasirlyeh and the village of Atneh is passed after about 3 m. The water- supply here is from an underground aqueduct. A path branches to 1. about here and runs to Ruheibeh village (10-12 m.) at the foot of the hills to S. This track then cuts through the hills, probably following the valley of a stream called Nahr el-Mukubrit, which rises at Ruheibeh and flows into the plain of Damascus past the village of Maqsureh (cf.

N. of Qasr el-Heir. There appears to be no drinking-water along the track till El-Jiba is reached (1B^ hrs. ? about 40 m. from Ain el-Beidha). At El-Jiba there is a perennial stream about 1 ft. wide and a few inches deep. The water tastes of sulphur, but less strongly than that of El-Beidha and Tadmor. There are a few huts beside the stream and a little cultivation. The place belongs to the Sheikh of 1891. KOUTE 58 c, pp. 348-349 TADMOR—HOMS Via Khirbet el-Hanureh112 LAND ROUTES Qaryatein. El-Jiba is connected by a track with the main route. This path runs NE. to El-Ferklus (see m. 55). It passes near some hot springs at a place called Abu Rubah (temperature 124° F.). At another place called Muran in the same district there is lignite. About 6-7 m. beyond El-Jiba is 'Ain el-Ghuntur, a wretched village on the edge of the desert, built partly of ancient stones. There are 2 strong springs of good water here and a considerable area of irrigated ground. [The track now runs NE. over rolling barren 'hills to Es-Sait (6 hrs., perhaps 20 m. from 'Ain el-Ghuntur). Beyond this point it runs over rolling, park-like country, increasingly fertile and cultivated, via Abu Dali to Horns. m. 55.

Add the folloiving notes: f (a) Old Caravan-eoute : Abu Kemal—Aleppo Besides the great desert routes detailed in this section'there was formerly a regular caravan-route from Basra to Aleppo passing across the desert by way of Qasr Bir Shagrah (S. of Nasiriyeh), Ukheidir (W. of Kerbela), Temail {Route 51), Kebeiseh {Route 52), Jubb Ghanam (W. of Abu Kemal), and c Ain el-Qom {Route 56). Another route left the Euphrates at Abu Kemal and joined the route from Basra at Jubb Ghanam. It is not known whether the track is still used, but there are some indications that it is followed by sheep-drovers. The following are some details of the Abu Kemal—Aleppo route, taken from old authorities.SYRIAN DESERT 113 Caravans from Basra or Baghdad left the Euphrates near Abu Kemal and struck into the Syrian Desert. The following seem to have been usual halting-places : Water Group of wells Wells, good water No water reported Large spring No water reported Wells, bad water Spring W. of track Well of bad water See Route 57, m. 125 An alternative route from Et-Turkmaniyeh went by c Ain ez-Zarqa (see Eoiite 56, m. 77) and El-Hammam passing S. and W. of Jebel Shebet.

The track ran SSE., passing not far E. of Kusafeh, and then, crossing some wadis, to the watering-place of Er-Rehub (38-40 m. from El-Hammam) on the Jebel Bishr. At one place in the plain a cave, called Ed-Dahal by the natives and said to be several miles long, was seen. It runs about 150 ft. below ground and has fallen in at the southern end. There are other similar breaks in the ground to S. and SE. at the foot of the Jebel Bishr. The wells of Rehub (also called Rehum) are about 150 ft. deep and have a perennial supply of good water. Beyond Er-Rehub no distinct path was found across the Jebel Bishr. The valleys are deep, and the N. slope of the hills is very steep. The summit of the ridge is about 3,300 ft. above the sea and about 2,000 ft. above the plain. Springs were reached at El-Quseibeh, about 50 m. E. of Er-Rehub, and from here the remaining 20 m. of desert was crossed to Deir, along a line apparently not far N. of the Deir—Damascus caravan- route.114 LAND KOUTES (e) The Country between Tadmor and El-Hammam In 1912 the party already referred to in Note {b) went from Tadmor to the Euphrates at El-Hammam. After following the track via Jisel for some distance (see Route 58 b) they turned N. into hilly country. The mountain-system as a whole here is called Abu Eijmen. It is composed of white limestone. The valleys are in general broad and shallow, the slopes easy, and in places thickly covered with terebinth- trees. In the north-western area there are extensive oak woods. Traces of ancient cultivation are to be seen everywhere, and there are many springs, most of them marked by the ruins of small villages. After about 27 m. the direction of the route changed to NE., and the summit was reached at the pass of Ed-Defai (alt. about 5,000 ft.; apparently about 40 m. from Tadmor). From here a wide view is obtained of the plain to N. The mountains fall steeply on that side and the foothills are formed of low ridges, with a general direction from S. to N. and a slope to the N. At about 52 m. from Tadmor a sharp turn was made NW. for about 7 m. to the watering-place of El-Kedem (see Route 57, m. 33), Here the direction again changed to N. for 19 m. to the fort called Et- Turkmaniyeh, situated on the most northerly spur of the El-Aweyr ridge. The building is rectangular and probably of Koman construction. The position is visible from Eusafeh, and it was probably important as commanding the approaches to watering- places. In February 1912 snow 3 ft. deep lay in this region for 22 days, and many sheep and goats died of exposure. From Et-Turkmaniyeh the direction followed was ENE. for 31 m. to Kusafeh, where Route 55 was joined.115 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS, pp. 350-377 ALTUN KOPRU. The population is given on good authority as 1,500-2000. The bridge over the eastern channel of the Lesser Zab described in the text is not passable for wheels and is apparently in bad repair. The bridge over the western channel is said to be passable by carts. ERBIL. The estimate for population appears very much exag gerated. It Should probably be about 6,000-7,000. HIT. For a few more details see Vol. II, Appendix D, and the correction to Route 46, m. 103f. EHANIEIN. General Description. —The bridge at Khanikin is reported in one account to have 14 spans, with a total length of 130 yds. and a roadway of 20 ft. The 60 yds. given in the text as the breadth of the river probably applies to the flood-width. According to a report of 1917 it is about 60 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep. The bottom is pebbly and easy for wheels. SALAHIYEH. Nasoleh coal-workings. The daily output of coal is reported to have been 40-50 tons before the fall of Baghdad, after which it dropped ' to less than 10 tons' owing to lack of labour and transport. There are said to be 4 pits, of which 2 are worked, producing good and plentiful coal. A steam-pump has apparently been erected. In November 1917 the Turks fired surface dumps during their tempo rary retirement in this region, but not, apparently, the mines them selves. SAMAHRA. After ' The Baghdad railway . . . (see Appendix)' add: ' A narrow-gauge line runs from the raft landing-stage to the main line.' Supplies and Commerce. —There are some old wells in the plain, and wells could be sunk there anywhere and get water at 30 ft. On the plateau deeper wells would probably find water, but would involve much labour.116 APPENDIX, pp. 395-399 BAGHDAD—SAMARRA RAILWAY, p. 395 After ' Time taken ... 5 hrs.' add : ' The telegraph follows the line.

The oil has a fair proportion of commercial benzines and heavy petrols. Light products, except benzines, are very liable to escape before getting into the stills. Refining is easy, owing to the absence of sulphur.'

                           A Handbook of Mesopotamia, Corrections and Additions to Volume III: Central Mesopotamia with Southern Kurdistan and the Syrian Desert(Naval Staff Intelligence Department: June, 1918). It supplements Volume III (IOR/L/MIL/17/41/4) which includes routes along the middle Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad to Fellūjeh [Fallujah] up to Mosul and Meskeneh [Maskanah]. The volume was prepared on behalf of the Admiralty and the War Office. These corrections and additions are based partly on information dating from before the Mesopotamian Campaign and partly on intelligence from 1917-1918.The volume contains a note on confidentiality, title page, 'Note', and 'Abbreviations'. There is a page of contents which includes 'Corrections and Additions to Itineraries' for River Routes and Land Routes, 'Corrections and Additions to Gazetteer of Towns', and 'Corrections and Additions to Appendix'. Several pages have been left blank for convenience of use with interleaved copies of the original edition.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Tigris River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Euphrates River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mosul</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lesser Zab (river)</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Syrian Desert</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maskanah</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023045524.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
