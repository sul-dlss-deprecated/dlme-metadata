At the rear of the file is a copy of a procedure, dated 19 December 1945, for the disposal of particular diaries, intelligence summaries and news reports. For instance, it is advised that Aden intelligence summaries be destroyed 'after perusal', whereas political agency diaries are to be destroyed 'two full years after receipt'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Records appraisal</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000163#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
