The necessity of Gazette notification is'not specifically laid down in the various Orders-in- Council, nor elsewhere, and our legal adviser has minuted that it is a matter of evidence, i.e. of adducing proof of the powers of a magis trate or judge if these are contested. He adds that the provisions of the Indian Evidence act (which applies in the Gulf States) are more or less similar to those of the Documentary Evidence Act, 1868 to sec tions 57(7) and 78(3) of which he draws attention. 3. Our conclusion is that it will probably be desirable for notificat ions of this sort in future to appear in the London Gazette., would you let me know whether you agree ? si G.G.

You should note that under Article 16 there is now no question of having a judge with partial powers, a person can only be appointed as a jud^e of the Court of tne Political Agent with legally all the jurisdiction of the judge of that court. Felly will remember that this change was made deliberately and on the footing that the i olitical agent as President of his Court settles ad hoc which cases he will try himself and which shall go to his assistant judge.

Bahrain' in the file title] for the area covered by the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913 (which included Qatar and the Trucial Coast). The initials 'I.A.' (standing for Indian Assistant, Bahrain), which originally appeared in the title below the reference to the Assistant Political Agent, have been crossed out.The extension of civil powers (of a subordinate judge of the first class) and criminal powers (of a first class magistrate) to the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain was originally designed to ease the burden of judicial work on the Political Agent, Bahrain. In some cases, Assistant Political Agents were granted preliminary civil and criminal powers at a lower level in order for them to acquire judicial experience. The papers consist of official notifications, and related correspondence between the Political Agency Bahrain, the Government of India, the India Office, and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf concerning the grant of civil and criminal powers to individual Assistant Political Agents.The covering dates in the date range are supplied by entries at the beginning and end of the file's notes; the covering dates of the correspondence are 7 April 1934 - 20 November 1950.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Judicial power</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00035e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
