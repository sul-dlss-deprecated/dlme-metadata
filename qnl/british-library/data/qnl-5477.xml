As I think you know, Kls Majesty^ Government in the united Kingdom, having tried without success to obtain the agreement of the Government of India to payment of the proposed gratuities in equal shares, authorised us to make the payments at last No Ruz while continuing to press the Government of India to pay their a hare. I am sure you will agree that it would have been impossible to keep these faithful servants in suspense any longer and that in the circumstances the United Kingdom Government had no alternative but to act as they did. I hope, however, that the Indian Embassy have represented and will continue to represent to the Government of India the inapproprlateness of allowing this charge to fall solaly on one of the Governments concerned. /ASisa t«dT V A» we see lt 9 it was open for the last incumbent© of the post to pay the gratuities out of the official funds at their disposal at the 14th Augustf 1947, and the fact that they did not do so cannot rightly be allowed to affect the principle of equal stores, I shall be very grateful if you can let me know what action you decide to take in this matter.

I also much regret that, owing to administrative difficulties, it has up till now not - been possible to complete a detailed statement of the menials and the gratuities to which they appear to be entitled, with a view to securing authority to pay from the Government of India. Such a statement has now been completed and a summary is enclosed herein. 5* In the meantime numerous appeals have been received from the menials, many of whom live in parts of Persia which may properly be called depressed areas and for many of whom the chances of gaining a livelihood are very small, and I fear that local opinion may lay the blame for this state of affairs at the door of His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom. 4. I therefore have the honour to request either that the Government of India may be approached as a matter of urgency with a view to obtaining authority for the payment of gratuities on the scale indicated in the enclosed summary, in which event they would no doubt instruct the Indian Embassy here to effect payment and would recover half the cost from His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom, as under the former moiety system; or that I may be ire tructed forthwith to pay the gratuities, charging the amount to my account for extraordinary disbursements, in which event Kis Majesty*s Government would no doubt seek to recover a moiety from the Government of India.
