Samuel Hennell states that he has received reports that the Prince has confirmed the appointment of Mirza Hassan Ally Khan in the Government of Bushire and rejected the propositions made by the sheiks of Bushire. In response, Sheik Houssein has declared his intention of holding possession of Bushire against Mirza Hassan Ally Khan and has reportedly requested that the merchants of Bushire leave town under pain of their houses being burnt and their goods plundered. Hennell states that trade in Bushire has been paralysed. He informs Justin Sheil that the merchants of the town are alarmed at the prospect of being forced to stand a seige by the royal forces and are equally terrified by the violent threats made by Sheik Houssein. Hennell expresses his doubts that Sheik Houssein intends to oppose His Royal Highness and suggests that the best thing the Prince could do would be to come to Bushire in person. He states that he has taken the preliminary measure of advising all Shiraz functionaries to leave Bushire without delay. The letter includes the following enclosures:Translation of a letter from His Royal Highness Feerooz Meerza [Firouz Mirza Nosrat-ed-Dowleh], Prince Governor of Fars, to Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated Zilkaada, in which the Prince discusses the appointment of Mirza Hassan Ally Khan as Governor of Bushire and expresses his astonishment that Hennell did not inform him of Sheik Houssein's recent behaviour. The Prince asks Hennell to communicate to him the real facts of the case.Translation of a letter, dated 14 October 1850, from Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, to His Royal Highness Feerooz Meerza, Prince Governor of Fars, in which Hennell states that the instructions that he holds from his own Government do not permit him to interfere in any way in the local affairs of Bushire, which was why he did not inform the Prince of Sheik's Houssein's behaviour.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000043#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
