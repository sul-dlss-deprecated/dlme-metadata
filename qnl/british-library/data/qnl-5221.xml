The Political Abency ^ K.B.li's Gonaalate^ Liu scat, the id^nd lie camber 1951. To The Hor^ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 2- ?Y ■&lt; / 3 i- ; l/eiLor^uaunx . 1 '-■&gt; / In continuation of i^y telet -ram Ko.290 of date I ei-close herewith the letter from ohai ^ch Ali referred to with a translation. It is possible, as I pointed out in my telegram, that M after a full year H may mean H at tne ®nd of tne year' though tne v»ords used do not indicate tlxis# If he had meant at the end of the year he should have written On the other hand the Aiqa dhows, ''^eo^le of the coast 11 , do return to Aiqa about A^ril-KLy the end of the Arabic year. However this may be his re^ly is merely the old Arab device of oerastination The 'people of the coast' have notning to do with the question as to whether the Aiqa should ^ay Customs dues; tnat is the right of the State. 2. Of course we can prevent the Aiqa dhows enterini 3ur in April-May, 'but tnis means having a sloop hanging about Sur day and night for about 6 weeks, as the exact dates of return of the dnows is of course not ^cnown. Conversely we can axlow the AiqA dhows to enter and say that they will not be permitted to come out until the State's terms have been agreed to* But first pressure on tne people of Aiqa does not affect so closely the Bani Bu Ali of Jaalan, and second this action will postpone a decision until after tne monsoon i.e. about September of next year. The Aiqa people will, Arab fashion, simply2. •it tigiit until tlie time f ®r their exodus approaches. I thinis therefore» as indicated in my tele^ram&gt; tliiit we should ta^e action as originally decided alter Hamazan• Kow sooit^ or liOTA lon^ alter, iiamazan we action we can of course choose to suit ourselves# 3 # one very important point whifch occurs to me is the security of the Flyi^ Base. The oovious choi«e is Kh»r Jerama, If Plying Boats are to be useds if aeroplanes then there is a landing ground at Ras-al-Haud. If the former then they could fly round to Lashicarah and then inland to Ealad Bani Bu All. As you are aware «e were rather rushed during your visit and had many other matters to discuss and there was nc immediate hurry. Alter your departure, however, I discussed this point informally with Group-Captain Welsh. Under instructions from the Air Vice-liar shal he w&lt;xs sending a flying boat, under command oi flight Lieutenant Ragg, to Has Madraka to maKe a reconnais sance of a ichor near there, the Bosit to start on t^e axter- noon of the Ifcith «cnd s^end the ni^ht at K-ior Terama. I su^ested that I should accompany the Boat, wnich v/ouxd leave me at the TOi.or t^ pic^c u^ local inforiiiation, and ^iwxv me u^ on her way bacic. This su^estion was welcomed. .Ve left Muscat on the afternoon of the xSth &amp;nd returned to ISUscat on the morning of the 20th. 4 % i had a letter from Saiyid Said for tne Shaikh of Ras-al-Hadd which merely asjced him to meet me at JChor Jerama. This I sent him on my arrival there, and he duly turned up. I did not of course say anything about possible operations against the Bani Bu Ali, but siiaply estaolished friendly relations with him, and made some enquiries, ^rom what he said and what Saiyid Said informed me I gleaned the fuxlowing. 5. The Bani Amer, whose head is the Shaikh oi.das-ii-Hadd, one bhaiida. Saif bin ^alim by name, hold territory in a bort of semi-circle from Khor Ruv /ais to 'between Klior J«rama. and Sur. South of their border come tJae Ban Bu Ali and Ban Bu Hassan. . The territory cf the former due south is aoout 20 miles away from Khor JeraLia, out to tne SaSi^may come considerably clttse. How the borders of the Bani Bu Ali and Bani Bu Hassan run I had no time to find out. But Balad Bani 3u All is apparently only some 20 miles inland from Laskkarah, and Balad Bani Bu Hassan only some 6 miles or so further inland again from Balad Bani Bu &gt;ili# 5, The Bani Amer are on ^ood terms with bath the Bani Eu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan. They own some date ^roves in the territory of the latter» but not in that cf th® former. The Bani Bu Ali&gt; who are Ghafiris, have a standing feud with the Bani Bu Hassan who are Hanawis. Saiyid Said informed me that it was quite likely that ii the B*ni ^u All were bombed the Bani Bu Hassan would taj£e the opportunity to attacK them. 7 # , putting oneself in the ^lace of the Bani Bu Ali&gt; if one really meant business one would at some sta^e in the proceedings, probably after tne iirst bomLingj seixu. a pai ty down to shoot a^-.the tlyin^ ooats at Khor Jerai^a, or L-ue aeroplanes at Has-al-Hatdd. At all events tiiio contongency must be taicen into account, and guarded against. Flight Lieutenant Hagg and I looiced at various pj-ace© o\er»looJcing tho Flying Boats anchorage whone'armed posts would have to be placed. The garrisons for the posts could conveniently come from the Bani Amer, (which idea Saiyid Said- when I ^ut it to him - seemed to thinic feasible), and by the Muscat Infantry. These might be reinforced by the presence of a sloop. How many men would be required could be gene into later. In order to reach Khor Jerama the Bani Bu Ali would have to infringe Bani Amer territory, tfiich would not be4. oo^ular with the latter and render them willing to coeperate with us. They would be ^a-id by the State lor t ^exr services. If land planes were used from Ras-al-Kadd, similar i &lt;r*tection would be necessary. Bani Xlie outsl^ndinb feature of Balad/Bu Ali is Uieir fort of which they are very ^roud, so Saiyid Saia i.m armed me. It is exceytionally li-rge one, and Saiyid Saiu tave ao ^e photographs of ii which Mr. Thomas toojc during his journey to Jaalan in 1923. (There is a description of tiiis juurney in his 'Alarms and Excursions in Arabia', but littl* that i, of interest from our present point of view). I showed the photSfcra^hs to Flight-lieutenant xia^g who was ef o^i.-ion that tne fort si.ould offer a t&gt;ooibombint object. 9&gt; you will remember that we discussed wiAt aiiou ^d be the line vt e should take with ■Jhaiich Ali «hen the K^ine for operations drew near. We decided that it should be such that we should not be committed to continue oombmg ana bombarding until ShaiJih Ali signed a decument agreeing to the State's terms. An Arab will often tacitly give wwy te force when he will refuse to sign a document acJcnewledging - surrender. The first step will presumably be for tne i.axi a.A °F ./ X and n get U aerial ^hetc. of it. When that is done, and naval cooperation has been arranged for, as well as for the guarding of the air bases, our action will de^nd on whether 3nai *h Ali is in Aiqa or net. If he is not then the Cuetem. ..,,st tnere will be establisned and he will be informed, both by messenger, and by me6sa fc e dropped on Balad Bani Bu AH, that if he interferes with it his fort in Aiqa will be bombarded by s.oops, and his fort at his Baiad by air -craft. The usual warning will be given to clear the womei. ana children out of Alqa and Balad Bani Bu All within a certain time if punitive action becomes necessary. If ne la m A^w with a large body of men he .ill be similarly informed that if he does not evacuate Aiqa within a certain ^riod, so that the post can be established, similar action will5. be taJten* In this case also of course if punitive action becomes necessary the usual warning will be &gt;ren« Lieut.Celonel, Political Agent &lt;Sc H.B.M's Consul, Muscat.From - Ali bin Abdullah A.1 Hamudah, Amir of Ja^alan.

SUR detachment of No, I do not contemplate posting of/levies at fixx Aiqa for following reasons (i) small detachment could not resist attack in force by Bani Bu Ali. (ii) to withdraw them if attack threatened would involve loss of prestige, while customs guards, if threatened, could easily withdraw to Sur. When post is established, if it is threatened at any time I consioer it would be best defended by counter measures against Shaikh anci no ^ ciefence of Aiqa itself. Theie are two possibilities (i) When Ali sees we mean business he may accept situation since loss of Aiqa does not actually affect him mucfi. (ii) He may threaten Aiqa now or later on ana afforo us ground for drastic measures against him. In this event there is likelihood that BANI BU HASSAN, who are his neighbours ana have permanent feud with BANI BTJ ALI, will attack him too. Combined effect would, I think, be permanently deterrent.

In regard to tne suggestion that H» M. Government should if necessary support the Government of Muscat in any they forcible measures wnich/may take I am to state that it appears to the Council that the situation is similar to that which arose in the early part of 1930, when, as Sir Samuel Hoare will be aware, arrangements were made for trie employment of a detachment of aircraft from Iraq (vide despatch lio.l37-S dated 28th March 1930 from the Political Resident) although the need for employing them did not arise. In these circumstances the Council suggest tnat tne attention of the Government of India should oe drawn to tne possibility that the employment of aircraft from Iraq might achieve the desired result on tnis occasion.

I am informing Saiyid Said, and the necessary letters will be despatched to shaikh Ali. I am also asking Saiyid Said to instruct the Wali of Sur to keep in close touch with Jaalan, and report any developments amongst the Bani Bu Ali. *1 /r 3. With reference to ^ra 6 of my letter No.C-289 of 22nd December 1931. Saiyid Said informs me that the Bani Bu Hassan have written to him to the effect that they have heard that there are differences between the State and the Bani Bu Ali, and that they - the Bani Bu Hassan - are always at the disposal of the State. Owing to the recent billing of a Bani Bu Hassan by the Bani Bu Ali the former just at present are apparently on particularly bad terms with the latter. ✓ V 4. With reference to your Express Letter No.C-41 of 18th December 1931. The Wali of bur will keep us informed of what is happening there. Communication, however, between Sur and Kuscat, as you axe aware, takes some time, so vJien Saiyid Said and I start from here inthe middle of February we will not be certain wnat has happened in Jur since the last news was receivedf i«e* wnetner Shaiidi Ali will be in Aiqa or not on our arrival, which, again will affect the course of action to be taicen. should punitive action be necessary one warship is doubtless sufficient for the demolition of Aiqa Fort, and for making Aiqa untenable by Shaikh Ali and his .oliowers. At the same time the greater the snow of strength we majce the less likely is it that we will have to use it (para 9 of my letter No.C-282 of 9th December), tne impression and the more permanent^/which will be nade primarily on t.xe Sani Bu Ali, and secondly on tne Jenebeh whom it wouId oe no narm to impress though tney are on their best Dehaviour at present. One must remember too that the Suris as a whole are quite accustomed to single warships making bombardment of tneir port, vide para 6 of my letter No.31-G of 12th February 1931. I venture to suggest therefore that two other sloops should kjK accomj-any the sloop in which Saiyid Said and I visit Sur. I am aware that this may cause dislocation of the Naval programme for February, and that it may not be possible to fall in with my suggestion, but it would, I think, be a good tiling if it could be arranged. 5. H.M.S.'Bideford M leaves Muscat on the 18th instant for Sur where she meets 'Emerald', and then visits various other Oman ports. Saiyid Said would li^e to visit Sur on the 'Bideford', and I should like to accompany him. The object of the visit will be merely to get personal touch with the local feeling there, and pick up the latest news about the attitude of the Bani Bu Ali. Saiyid Said f s arrival there in company wi th a cruiser of the size of the 'Emerald' should also have a good moral effect.

SUBJECT:- S U R. v ^V Please refer to your telegram No.30 of 15th January On the 19th instant Saiyid Said and I left here on H.M.S. '♦Bideford' which was to meet H.ll.S.'VEmerald' at Sur. At my suggestion Jemadar Mohamed Ibrahim, Adjutant of the Muscat Infantry, accompanied us, as I intended to make reconnais sances of Ras-al-Hadd and Khor Jeramah, vide paras 3 and 7 of my letter No.28y of 22nd December 1931. i / 3 Y/ith regard to the likelihood of a Bani Bu Ali raid on the air -craft base, it is Interesting to note that in February 1821 a force of British and Indian Troops* on its way to Balad Bani Bu Ali to avenge the defeat there of a former expedition in the previous year, disembarked at Sur. Imagining itself secure the force failed to take proper o precautions, and three hundred of the Bani Bu All»making a march of 50 miles from Jaalan, attacked the sleeping camp at night before they were discovered. They were repulsed after some hard fighting, but with a loss to the force of 16 Killed and 26 wounded.(Vide Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India Volume ^257.) 2 o ^e reached Sur on the evening of the 19 th when the '^ali came on board. Captain Clayton kindly asKed Saiyid Said and me to dine on board the •♦Emerald'. On the morning of the 20th Saiyid Said landed at Surbeing given iiis aalute by the 'Bideford*, which went on to Ras-al-JIadd. There I went ashore with Commander McGrath and the Jemadar and had a friendly reception from Shaikh Saif of the Bani Amer in his village (see my letter quoted above para 5). I gave the Shaiidi a letter from Saiyid aaid asking him to return on board the M Bideford w to Sur where he - Saiyid Said - wished to have a discussion with him. Commander McGrath, the Jemadar and I examined the viflimty of the village for about 3 hours, and drew up a rough scheme for the defence of the landing ground from possible raids of the Bani Bu Ali&gt; the scheme including a sloop, the /il Saidi, 2 platoons of the Muscat Infantry (60 men), and Bani Amer friendlies. The Shaikh, with his brother, accompanied us back on board ship, which then left for Khor Jeramaku 3* Sub-Lieutenant Langmore, the Jemadar and I went ashore at Khor jeramah in the afternoon and made another reconnaissance. Tiie scheme of defence,vhich was shown to Commander McGrath ) included as tefore a sloop, the Al Saidi, 2 platoons of Muscat Infantry and friendlies from the Bani Amer. An important factor in the scheme is whether a sloop can enter the Khor or not. I have handed over uoth the schemes to Captain Alban who arrived at Muscat on the 22rd instant. The 'Bideford' returned to Sur on the morning of the 21st when Saiyid Said was re-embarked. He informed me that all was quiet in Sur and that there was no particular news from Jaalan. He confirmed the fact that tne aam du Hassan were on particularly bad terms with the Lani Bu AH (my letter Ko.C-i of 5th January para 3). 5. Saiyid Said had a conversation with Shaiida Saif on board. The latter professed his willingness to help the State, should it be necessary, and stated that the latter could count on his tribe. Another tribe, however, the5. Bani Ghazal share with the Bani Amer the Ras-al-Hadd—Khor Jaramah area* The Shaiidi could not answer for them but thought they would 'be willing to join in» visit to Sur on board a sloop, especially with the presence of the ,, Emerald' , , had a good moral effect, and his conver sation with Shaiidi Saif was satisfactory. The plan of the defence of air-craft at Ras-al-Kadd and Khor Jeramah, even though tentative and subject to alteration, should prove useful if necessity arises, and it is obviously better that this question of defence should be considered at liesure now than in a hurry at the last moment. 6 The trip was a successful one.

While oonourring in the action which it is proposed should be taken by one of H.U.ohips, Vtf Lords are serlousay concerned as to the repercussions on our relations with the Arab Rulers generally, end particularly the relations between them and H # M«Ships on the station, of the proposed bonbing by aircraft of Jaalan fort. Aircraft have not previously been used against these aulers, our policy having been to inflict the lainimuu iml^iiii.ent nece; ry tx) produce compliance with our aemrmus and-to take every precaution to avoid loss of human life. Such police measures are well understood and have not embittered our relations. The accuracy of gunfire has enabled such a policy to e carried out# My Lords have no information as to the precise position of Jaalan fort but They would point out that unless it is well clear of other buiiaint's ana of dwellings, it will probably be impossible to adhere to the previous Tinder-Secretary of State, IBDIA OF.'ICE.n&gt; 'A pr vious policy of xaeasured punirinnent ana avoidance of Xoas of life.

It would have been ttiout^t to be more in accordance with previous policy to await the effect of the naval action before trying air action# In any case Lords would suggest that Che effect of a aeiuonatratlon by alrccaft over the aheii^s inland head uarters mi^it be tried before bombing is actually carried out# In this connection I am to refer to ttie Political Resident's telegram of the 15th instant reporting that the Beni Bu Hassan have offered to assist the Sultan of Muscat# My Lords woulu suggest that thic is an adaltlonal means of bringing pressure to bear on the Beni Bu All which mi$it ^render bombing unnecessary# They also consider that another form of pressure that might l s si £ would be the sto&gt; age at Jur of all supplies or the Beni Bu All# A copy of this lett' r has been aent to the Foreign Office and Air Ministry.

AIR UNISTRY, LONDON, 2. 4th February, 1932. 3ir, : ^ cotmanded by the Air Council to refer to •idniiralty letter No. M.0141/32 of the 29th January. 1932 (a copy of which wae forwarded to the Air Ministry), on the subject of the pronoaed naval and air action at 3ur. it appears to the Council that the views of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty as expressed an this letter are due to misaoprehension. It seems, for example, to be inferred at air aCti0n as 8uch ^cessarily inflicte more than the minimum punishment necessary' to produce compliance; (2) that en without d ' Je regard to the avoidance of loss of human life; (3) that it is likely to have 'repercussions' unfavoura le to British interests in the Persian Gulf; and 1 iy (4) that the 3e P arate U8e ^ naval and air action would oe preferable to a simultaneous employment of both methods of coercion. 2- The 3ecretary of State for India will be aware that hoa h su^estions as to the inhumanity' of air action and as to a legacy of hatred' from its use have been made from time to time, these suggestions have not been supported, but definitely controverted by actual experience of air operations, hen in 192. the overnment of India expressed their considered vie's on this aspect of the bombing of tribesmen they stated that 'Cf personal rancour over air operations, or of retaliation on one:, or Hher mcuviduals there has been no sign' and again 'We do not think that the danger of alienating the well disposed elements in a tribal community by the use of aircraft is a real one'. (C.l.D. 141-D). his opinion, based as it was on the collated experience of/ xhe Under- Secretary of State, ' 0 litical Department). -i-ndia Uffice, SeV. 1.J, ' ■ H 5fe of political officers in touch with the tribes should, in the Council^ view, dispose of the misgivingB expressed in the Admiralty's letter as to the effect upon relations with the Arab rulers in the area concerned and the fear that relations between the tribesmen and the personnel of the Royal liavy will become embittered. There is, of course, much independent testimony by senior political officers in Iraq and elsewhere to the same effect. 3. A 8 regards the particular apprehensions disclosed by Their Lordships' letter, the Council would further observe:- (a) That it has been an mvariablf principle amon^ all three'fighting Services of the Crown that when torce has to be employed to achieve the objects of H.l. Government the degree of force recommended should be the minimum considered likely to achieve the end in view. This principle has been, and will be, applied no less rigidly by the Royal Air Force than by the other Services. (b) Air operations against the habitations of tribesmen not in open war against H.l . Government have never been undertaken and never will be undertaken, except after all possible action has been taken to reduce loss of life to a minimum. It has been, and will continue to be, the invariable practice for tribes to te warned that a village is liable to be bofcibed and should be evacuated. oreover, the demonstration suggested in the Admiralty letter is, as the Secretary of State for in lia will be aware, the invariable preliminary to air operations of the nature proposed and may, as has frequently occurred, render them unnecessary. (c) ihe view apparently held by the Lords Commissioners ol the Admiralty that the bombing of Jaalan Fort will adversely aifect the relations between H.L. Government and the tribes elsewhere in the Persian Gulf area, especially in regard to the Arabian air route, seems to the council to be unsupported by any evidence. iiixperience on the Worth West Frontier of India, in Iraq and in Aden leads rather to the conclusion that li.^ lscriminatin6 use of aircra ^ against one tribe or section results in an improvement in relations between Government and other tribes or sections in the same area Indeed the Council take the view that, if one recalcitrant ruler finds that by retiring inland out of reach of naval bombardment he can be defiant with impunity, others will be quick to appreciate our weak ness and to^take advantage of it by raising all possible difficulties ana objections against every proposal for the implementing of British policy in the Persian ^ulf. In ;act, it is due to the recalcitrant nature oi the tribes beyond the reach of naval bombardment that our negotiations for the establishment o ,he alternative civil air route to India have been so prolonged.-^r 9° (d) The Admiralty proposal that naval action should be undertaken alone in the first instance midit lead to a recurrence of the stalemate which occurred in 1928 unde almost similar circumstances. Un this occasion the fort was destroyed and the sloop retired, whereupon, in the words of the Resident in his confidential despatch No. 688-3 dated the 28th December, 1929, 'after its departure, the Beni Bu iili had resumed their occupation of the customs house and re-hoisted the flag ,, The present proposal by the Resident, Persian Gulf (in which the Air Officer Commanding and the Senior Naval Officer have both concurred), has doubtless been put forward in the light of this experience; indeed in his confidential despatch No. 137-3 dated the 18th March, 1930, to the Government of India, the Resident states in regard to these oreposed operations at Sur that 'I agree that action by warship alone would be entirely ineffective; past history has shewn this'. 4. The Council are, therefore, of the opinion that the apprehensions expressed by Pheir Lordships are not justified. They consider, on the contrary, that these operations, carried out under the normal safeguards that have been in force for ten years, will not only give the best chance of achieving their object quickly and humanely, but should also result m a closer understanding between the Services as to the nature of each other's work and the benefits of co-operation.

I should liJce to emphasise the fact that theve are merely tentative, as I explained to you, and are of course subject to any alterations which the authorities concerned consider necessary. You have already dis cussed the plans with Captain Alban who is accompanying you today for a reconnaissance of Has-al-Hadd and Kher Jeraoa. 3. With reference to para 5 of the Secret memorandum quoted above. (a} There would seem to be only two villages concerned) one Balad Bani Bu Ali, *1 th its large fort, and the other Balad Bani Bu Hassan. (Balad means village or dwelling piace). The2. Bani Bu Hassan are friendly to tae State and iiestile to tne Bani Bu (uy letter^to i&gt;ara 3).

Sd/- T.C.FewleExtract from letters from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* No* C-289, dated the 22nd December 1931. xx* 3# One very important point which occurs to me is tne security of the Jlyin^ Base. The obvious choice is / Ota or Jerama, if flying Boats are to be used: if aeroplanes then there is a landing ground at Ras-al-Hadd. If the foriter then they could fly round to Lashkarah and then inland to Balad Bam Bu Ali. As you are aware we were rather rushed during your visit and had many other matters to discuss and there was no immediate hurry* After your departure, however, I discussed this point inforiially ^ith Group-Gaptaxn Welsh* Under instructions from the Air Vice-Marsh*1 he was sending a flying hoat, under command of i'light Lieutenant Ragg, to Ras Madra^ca to maice a reconnais sance of a IQior near there, the boat to start on tne afternoon of the 12th and s^end the night at Khor Jerama* I sug c&gt; ested ti^it I should accompany the boat, which would leave me at the Khor to pick up loca^ mfomation, and picic me up on her way back. ThiB suggestion was welcomed* We left Muscat on txie afternoon of the 18th and reLurned to Muscat on the norning of tne 20th. i had a letter from Saiyid baid for the .inai^h of Ras-al-Kadd which merely a sited him to meet me at Khor Jerama. This 1 sent him on my arrival there, and he duly turned up. I did not of course say anything aoout possioie operations against tne Bani Bu Ali» tmt simyly estabusned friendly relations with him, arid macie some enquiries. 'Prosi what he said and what liaiyid iJaid informed me I gleaned the following. The Bani Amer, whose head is the Shaiidi of2. Hitb-al-Hadd, one Shaikh Saif bin Salim by naue, hold territory in a sort of a eiiii -circle from Khor Ruwaie ta between Khor Jerama and 3ur. Soutn of their border come the Ban Bu All and Ban Bu H&amp;scan. The territory of the forme. due south is about 20 miles away from fOior Jerama, but t© the west may come considerably closer. Kow the borders of the Bani Bu Ali and Bani Bu Hassan run I had no time to find out. But Balad Bani Bu Ali is apparently only some 20 miles inland from Lashkarah, and Balad Bani Bu Hassan C only some 6 miles or so fuller inland a^ain from Balad Bani Bu Ali. 6. The Bani Aaer are on good terms with both the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan. They own some date groves in the territory of the latter, but not in that of the former. The Bam Bu Ali» who are Ghafiris, have a standing feud with the Bani Bu Hassan who are Hanawis. Saiyid Said informed me tnat it was t^uite liiie^y that if txic Bani Bu All were bombed the Bani Bu Hassan wou^d ta^ce the opportunity to attach them. 7. Putting oneself in the place of the Bani Bu Ali, if one really meant business one would at some stage in the proceedings, probably after the first bombing, send a party down to shoot up the flying boats at Khor Jerama, or the aeroplanes at Raa-al-Hadd. At all events this contentency must be taken into account, and guarded against. Flight Lieutenant Ragg and I looked at various places over-looking the Flying Boats anchorage where armed posts would have to be placed. The garrisons for the posts could conveniently come from the Bani Amer, (which idea Saiyid Said - when I put it to him - seemed to think feasible), and from the Muscat Infantry. These might be reimorced by the presence of a sloop. How many men would be required couid be gone into later. In order to reach i&lt;hor Jerama the Bani Bu Ali would have to infringe Bani Amer territory, which would not be popular with the latter and render them willing to cooperate3* vitii ufc&gt;. Ikey wouxd be toy State for t^tir bervicce. If land pianee were uaed irom Ras -ai-liaad, similar protection would be necebbary. b. The outbtanding feature of Baiad Bam Bu Ali is their fort of which they are very proudf so Saiyid Said informed me. It is an exceptionally large one, and Saiyid Said gave me some photographs of it whoch Mr. Thomas t«Oi£ during his journey to Jaalan in 1928. (There is a description of tnis Journey in nis 'Alarms and Excursions in Arabia' 9 but little that is of interest from our present point of view). I shewed the phetographs to flight-Lieutenant Ragg who was of opinion that the fort shouid offer a good bombing object. X XX Mo. C-l» dated the 5th January 1932. 3. Witn reierence to para 6 of my letter Ko.C-209 of 22nd Decenoer 1931. Saiyid Said informs me that the Bani Bu Hassan have written to him to the effect that they havtj heard that there are differences between the Sta&amp;e and the Baui Bu Ali» and that they - the Bani Bu Hassan - are always at the disposal of uie State. Owing to Uie recent killing of a Bani Bu Hassan by the Bani Bu All the former Just at present are apparently on particularly bad terms with the latter. X XX llc.C-lo, dated the 2bth January 1932. On the 19th instant Saiyid Said and I left here on H.l'.S. 'Bideford' which was to meet h.lt.S.'Herald M at Sur. At my suggestion Jemadar Mohamed Ibranim, Adjutant of the l;uscat Infantry, accompanied us, as I intended to iLake reconnais sances of Kas-al-Hadd and Khor Jeramah, vide ^aras 3 and 74. of 11$ letter Mo.239 of 22nd Beceiuber 1931. With regard to tne iiicclixiood of a Bani Bu All raid on the axi air-craft baae, it is interesting to note that in February 1821 a force of Brxtxeh and Indian Troope, ©n iti way to Balad Bam Bi Ali to avenge the defeat there of a foriter expedition in tlie previous year, disejebarked at Sur. IiuLgining itself secure the force failed to take pre per precautions, and three hundred of the Bani Bu Ali, juaking a march of 50 ailec frca Jaalan, attacked tne sleep in^ camp at night before they were discovered. They v ^ere repulsed after seme hard fighting, but with a loss to the force of 16 billed and 26 wounded. (Vide Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India Volume VI pa ^e 257.) 2. We reacned 3ur on the evening of the x^th when the 'wall caiae on board. On the morning of the 20th Saiyid ^aid landed at Sur bexikfe feiven his salute by the ''iiidel ord ', which v /ent on to Ras-al-Kaad. There I went ashore with Comaunder % itoGrath and the Jemadar and had a friendly rf.cepticn from ShaiKh Saif of tixe Bani Arner in his village (see my fetter quoted above j^ara 5). I gave the Shaikb a letter from Saiyid baid asking him to return on board the 'Biaeford* to Sur vthbre he - Saiyid Uaid - wished to uave a discussion with him. Goiiiiiiander I 'cGrath, tho Jemadar and I examined the vicinity of ihe village lor about hours, and drew up a rou^i scheme for the defence of tho landing ground from possible raids of the Tani Fu Ali# the scheme including a sloop, the Al Saidi, 2 platoc^nr- of the Uuscat Infantry (6J uen), iind Bani Jjner friend^^® y The tihai^Ji, with ms brother, accompanied us back on board ship, which tnen left for :Chor Jeramah. 3. iiub -Lieutenant Langmore, the Jemadar and I went ashore at iChor Jeraimh in the aiternoun and made another reconnaissance. The scheme of defence, v&lt;hicii ••'as si.own5. to CeMianaer McGr&amp;th, included before a sloop, the Al Saidi, 2 pXatoens of tluBoat ItiTantry and iriendiics frcn. t-ie Bani Aiaer. An iw ^ortaut x 'actor in the scheme is wnether a sloop can enter tne Kiior or net. I have handed over 'both the echemes to Captain A lb an viio arrived at llUecat on the 23rd instant# 4, The M Bideford M returned to bur on tne worning of too 21at when Saiyid Said was re -eabarised. He iuforned me tnat ail wan quiet in iiur and that there was no particular news from Jaaian. He confirmed the fact toat the Bani Bu Hassan were on particularly bad terms wxth tue Bani Bu Ali (my letter No.C-1 of tne t)th January para 3). 3. iiaiyid Said had a conversation v ith SnaiJch Saif en board. The latter professed his willingness to iielp- the State, snouxd it be necessary, and stated that the xatter could count on his tribe. Another tribe, however, the Bani Ghazal share with the Bani Amer the Ras-al-Kadd - lOior Jtramah area. The Shailct could not answer for thorn but thought they would bo wiilin^ to join in. 6, The trip was a successful one. Saijii ^aid s&gt; visit to Sur on board a sloop, especially with toe presence of the •Smoraiu', had a good moral effect, and hx6 conversation with Siiai^ Said was satisfactory. The i-lan of toe defence of air-craft at Raa-al-Uadd and JChor jeramah, oven though tentative and subject to -Iteration, should prove useful if neaeusity arises. r JTelegram From To No 528 R, 27 Secretary of State for India, London.

The village is composed almost entirely of matting buildings and can be completely burnt by incen diaries at any time. 3. The fort is as you see a pretentious affair and in all probability the pride of the ShaiKn of tne Bani Bu All. I think it is probable tnat a few 250 % pound bombs dropped into that fort would soon bring the ShaiKh to heel. 4. After seeing the photographs I am strongly in favour of our original plan, namely that the Bani Bu Ali fort should be bombarded by air at the same time as tne Aiqe fort is bombarded by sea. I suggest we should go on bombing the Bani Bu ^li fort until the Shaikh sends in nis submission. If tne destruction of the fort does not oring about nis submission we could later on burn the village at any time. /5 Colonel H... Biscoe, Hon'ble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Residency, B U SHIRE.5. Tiie fort is sucn a big target tnat tne attacks can be confined entirely to it, and as due warning will be given before the bombing coaimences tnere snouid be no loss ol life. It is quite an ideal air target. 6. I understand tnat Fowle is against tne use of aircraft, but ne does not seem to nave given 'Welsn any reason for nis opposition. 7. I suggest operations as follow That wnen the warnings are issued to tne Bani Bu All tnat the customs post is going to be establisned and tnat it is not to be interfered with, proclamations should at the same time be dropped from the air over Balad Bani Bu Ali. They can of course oe sent by nand as well, but I do attach some importance to actually dropping these proclamations by air as I tniiiis. it may go some way towards convincing them that we mean business by air and that we can carry it out. The proclamations should contain a definite warning tnat if the Shaikh misbehaves,^his fort at Jalaan will be aestroyed by air. Then if ne interferes with the customs post I suggest tnat we snouid carry out your plan of a combined and simultaneous bombardment of the fort of ^iqe and of the Jalaan fort. This combined attach should be car ried out whetner Shaikh Ali is at Aiqe or not, (para, ii of your C.41 dated 18.1^.31 to India refers). I am afraid that if we only drive him out oi Aiqe and do not attach nis central strongnold at Jalaan, he will sooner or later come bac^ and shuot up tne customs nouse at Aiqe. The bombardment of Jalaan will be carried out inter- /mittently.•&gt; d mittently; lor example, two days' bombardment; interval 01 one day; one day's bombardment; interval of two days; two days' bombardment; and so on. These recommendations do not * ally »v i t ii .islsn's proposals in the attached paper, but 1 have talned to him about it and he c [uite agrees in the above, I iiave just seen iTovvle's letter, C-15 dated 25th January, 1952, in whicn he reports that he and Commander McGrath drew up a rough scneme for the defence rw «. L&lt; vixcovi*^ , oi the landing ground au Has al Hadd^ He made the same sug C) estion for tne deience of the anchorage at Knor Jarama. Group Captain Welsh is quite confident, and I entirely agree with him, that provided tne defence is properly organised and tnal tne usual precautions are taKen, two platoons of Muscat infantry will be ample to secure either the anchorage at xLhor Jarama or the aero- • c * drome at Has al -Hadd, and that a sloop will be quite un necessary and will not be required in either case. On the other nand we should of course always be grateful for any assistance wnich the Navy could render in con nection with tne establishment and maintenance of these posts should tnere be any service wnich tney could con veniently render. ^ *5 . ^ R ka - cU. s2 - 4, ihe Rangoons were compelled to remain at Has al iOiaixaah until the morning ox 2.2.52 owin^ to a s^ron^ Shamal at muscat which precluded even the mail steamer usin^ the harbour.

Many thanks for your Scoret letter Uo.S,10573 of the 15th February 1932 regarding the Sur operations and for the interesting photographs which accompanied it and which I am very glad to have. I agree with the views expressed in paragraph 7 of your letter. I understand Shaikh Ali is now in J&amp;alan and he is showing signs of coming to terms. If f however, he has not definitely done so by the time 1 arrive at Sur I propose to establish the customs post, and then to send word to him by hand that if he or his people at Aiqa molests the post in any way the fort at Aiqa and the fort at Jaalan will be simultaneously destroyed. I agree th t proclamations to this effect should simultaneously be dropped over Jaalan by aircraft. 1 would give him a day or two in which to reply if he wants to do so, though the letter actually will not call for a reply. We will go away having, so to speak» baited the hook, and if he bites^ the aircraft and sloops will re-assemble and take action without further parley, and in such circumstances I entirely agree as to the desirability of simultaneous action at Aiqa and Jaalan. The only point which seems to me parhaps a little bit unnecessary is to carry out a two days 1 bombardment in the first instance. I would sugtsest one day^ bombardment and then give him time to climb down and if he does not do so then to carry out a regular intermittent bombardment. It depends, however, on the damage doae on the first day. If the fort has ...

T have received a letter froifi the President of the Council of Ministers, Said bin Taimur, in v/hich he says that my letter to the Political Resident has been received by you and that he does not accept what we have asked from him. Saiyid Said says that he has postponed his demands out of rejard for Rsmazan; what was suggested to us by the Political Resident that is:- The Muscat Government has the ri^ht to collect taxes I'rom Aiqa, to register its dhows and to appoint at Aiqa four guards to collect taxes. They will hire a house for them (guards) from us and allow us £ 100 as compensation for Aiqa taxes and registration of dhows, in addition to the first hundred. Goods arriving at the Sur Customs in my name to a certain amount are exempted by the Government. I have replied that there is coming to you after the Id a trustworthy man; perhaps the matter can be settled without any trouble. ''That is left for us to do is to put these conditions in writing, the fixation of the period of the agreement and the recognition of our possession. The agreement would especially be for the Aiqa taxes and registration of dhows and nothing else. Abdullah bin Ahmad A1 Rawwaf Al Najdi is coming to you discuss the matter with him as he is fully authorised by me.Translstion of a letter dsted 19th Ramazsn 1350 (28-1-32) from Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamudah, to Colonel T.C.Fowle, Political A^ent and H.B.M'a Consul, Ivluecat.

He is Abdullah bin Ahmad Al Rawvaf Al ^Tajdi. The difference between us is of words. The object is that you give us a document to be in our hands according to the letter of the Political Resident and his terms and suggestions to the I'usoat Government o: - That the Muscat Government has the right to collect taxes from the port of Aiqa, to register its dhows and to appoint four men at Aiqa to collect taxes, two from us and two from them. That the Muscat Government does not build a custom house at Aiq? but rents a house from us for the guards. The Government of Luscat would pay compensation for the taxes of Aiqa / 100 per mensem in addition to the pay fixed formerly for my father and exemption from customs dues of a certain quantity of goods arriving for me at the Customs of 3ur. I accept all this on the condition that you would write us a document. The number of the years of the agreement should also be mentioned in it which should be in our hands. - he Government of Muscat also should recognise our possession. Such terms would be null and void if not put in writing and would not be considered. According to the existing rule and custom nothing is considered unless it is in writi -rrg.Copy of letter aatea 24th lianazan 1350 (2-2-1932) from baiyid Said bin Taimur, Kuacat, to ShaiJch Sulaiman iin Kamyar al Nabhani.

Instructions regarding the Control of Operations including the Employment of Air Forces on the North-West Frontier of India.CONFIDENTIAL. Serial No. 77 32411/G.S.-M.0.1. 1931. i » Instructions regarding the Control of Operations including the Employment of flir Forces on the North-West Frontier of India.This document is issued under the authority of the Government of India. G. M. YOUNG. Secretary to the Government of India. A rmy D epartment : 1st August 1931. MC143CGS(Mi8C)CONFIDENTIAL PROVISIONAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE CONTROL OF OPERA TIONS INCLUDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF AIR FORCES ON THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER OF INDIA. 1. These instructions deal with the procedure to be followed in the control of operations on the North-West Frontier of India, where the co-ordinated action of two or more of the three services, political, military and air. becomes necessary. They will be considered as provisional pending confirmation, but in the mean time they supersede ' Instructions regarding the Employment of Aeroplanes on the North-West Frontier '', No. 23639-G. S., M. 0. 1. 1928, and any other instructions previously issued. 2. It is an axiom that in the event of emergency all available forces shall act and shall support each other with the greatest energy and rapidity. This can only be achieved provided :— {a) The closest liaison exists between the political, the air, and the army representatives. (6) There is single control of each operation. 3. Two main principles are involved :— (a) The object of all three forces, irregulars, air and regulars is identical, namely, the prevention of trouble, or the defeat of the enemy and the restoration of normal conditions in the shortest time possible. (b) The most effective way of attaining this is by a co-ordinated plan and by a full measure of co-operation between all the forces available. 4. In applying these principles in times of peace the following procedure which does not require the previous sanction of the Government of India will be followed :— (a) Civil Armed Forces—The normal day to day watch and ward duties of the civil armed forces will continue to be controlled by the Political authorities as heretofore, including the rounding up of outlaws, laying ambushes for raiders or gun-runners, intercepting raiding gangs, and haramta against hostile tribes. Such activities of these forces are not operations within the definition of paragraph 5 below. (6) Air Reconnaissance. —This does not include any offensive action nor does it commit the Government of India in any way to offensive action. It is merely a protective measure, taken when the situation demands, as an insurance against surprise. The military or civil authorities mentioned below may call for an air reconnaissance without reference to higher authority :— CyhVlX — Chief Commissioner, N. W. F. P. Resident in Waziristan. Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan, • and such Deputy Commissioners and Political Agents as the above officials may wish to delegate this authority to. {ii) Military— General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command. Commander, Peshawar District. Commander. Kohat District. Commander, Waziristan District.(m) General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, may, at their descrebion, delegate their authority to any selected sub ordinate Commander. (iv) Air reconnaissance shall not be called for by any military authority except after consultation with the political officei concerned. (v) Whenever possible, the ordinary channels of communication will be adhered to and every opportunity will be taken for consultation between the civil, military and Royal Air Force authorities concern ed. The sanction to dispense with reference to higher authority is accorded solely to avoid delay in an emergency. (c) A ir Demonstration. —This is not offensive action nor does it commit the Government of India to such action. Its employment is a question of policy and is not dictated by the immediate military requirements of the troops or other Government forces. It can be ordered by the undermentioned civil officials on whom will rest the responsibility for calling out aeroplanes for this purpose :— Chief Commissioner, N. W. F. P. The Resident in Waziristan. The Agent to the Goveror General in Baluchistan. (d) Should an unforeseen emergency arise such as the sniping of or the offering of active opposition to any force, whether irregular or regular, by the tribesmen, the authority under whom the civil forces are acting or in the case of a regular force the District or Force Commander may call for air assistance without reference to higher authority. In such cases aeroplanes may take offensive action provided such action is confined to the tribesmen actually engaged. For the above purpose calls for air assistance will be made to the nearest Wing Commander, Royal Air Force, or to the Officer Commanding, squadron or detachment. Royal Air Force, if the nearest Royal Ah Force unit is a detached squadron or portion of a squadron. Such calls will be repeated through the usual channels to superior authority, political, military and Royal Air Force. {e) Mobile Columns. —Whenever a Mobile Column is out, the Commander of the District concerned will arrange through the usual channels, for such air support as may be considered necessary. Officers Commanding No. 1 (Indian) Group or No. 3 (Indian) Wing. Royal Air Force, will make the necessary arrangements and report action taken to Royal Air Force Headquarters. The Officer Commanding a Mobile Column is authorised to employ with his column such aeroplanes as have been detailed to support him. Aeroplanes employed with a Mobile Column can take any action the situation renders advisable with the following exceptions :— (i) No offensive action is to be taken unless hostile sniping or other active opposition is encountered. (ii) Offensive action is limited to that required to deal with actual off enders, i.e., personnel targets only. It will be advisable to use aeroplanes freely for reconnaisance or for demonstrations in con nection with any operations or march of a Mobile Column. {{) Retaliation against rifle fire from tjte ground. —When aeroplanes carrying out any of the duties described above are subjected to deliberate and definitely hostile fire from the ground and the individuals responsible for such firing can be clearly discerned, they may, in the absence of specific instructions to the contrary issued beforehand by com petent authority, retaliate in their own defence with machine gun fire or bombs against such individuals. This action must not be taken indiscriminately and is never to be used against villages.5. When a more serious situation arises involving offensive action not provided for in paragraph 4 such action will be classified as ' an operation ' and will require the orders of the Government of India as soon as they can be obtained. 6. Operations fall into two classes :— (1) those which are deliberately undertaken against the tribes, (2) those which are forced upon the local officers by tribal action. 7. In dealing with operations forced upon them by tribal action local officers of all services, political, military and air will— (а) consult together as fully as circumstances allow, (б) make the best arrangements that the means at their disposal admit, (c) report the facts and submit their recommendations to higher authority as fully and promptly as they can. 8. In such cases or when the deliberate initiation of operations is advocated, the Government of India, on receipt of a recommendation from the Chief Commis sioner, North-West Frontier Province or Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan which is to be made in the manner prescribed in paragraph 9 below, will decide whether operations are to be undertaken, or continued if they are already in progress, and specify the general objective. 9. The following procedure will be observed :— (i) Whenever the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province or Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan, either on receipt of a report from an officer subordinate to him or of his own motion, is of opinion that operations whether by land, or air or both should be under taken against a tribal enemy in the area for which he is responsible, he shall after consultation with the appropriate military and air Commander, forward his recommendation by telegram to the Secre tary to the Government of India in |;he Foreign and Political Depart ment, repeating to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Army Department. (n) The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department on receipt of such recommendation will at once bring it to the notice of the Government of India and the Secretary to the Government of India in the Army Department will similarly bring it to the notice of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and inform the General and Air Staffs. (m) When the Government of India have decided that operations are to be undertaken, control of those operations vests automatically in His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief who has power to delegate control of operations to such officer as he may select. (iv) ' Control ' of operations includes the selection of local objectives with the concurrence of the political authorities, the initial framing of the plan, the selection of the forces required to carry out that plan, the dispositions of these forces both in the initial stage and sub sequently in order to deal with developments as they arise, and the allocation of tasks to the several components of the force. {v) Such delegation of control does not transfer to the officer selected either the executive command of units of another service or give him power to interfere with the methods adopted by executive commanders of such units to carry out the tasks assigned to them. {vi) Should the operation entail the offensive action of land forces, whether regular or irregular, with or without the co-operation of aircraft His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief will normally delegate the control of such operation to a Military Commander. {vii) Should an objective be beyond the reach of land forces and necessitate air action. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief will normally delegate the control of such operation to the Air Officer Commanding with whom the military forces will co-operate as required.10. Air action against villages must never be undertaken except after due warning as in paragraph 11 below, and with the previous sanction of the Government of India. 11. Warnings. —These are quite distinct from ' demonstrations ' [paragraph 4 (c)] and although they do not include offensive action, they definitely commit the Government of India to such action if the warning is ignored or is not considered to have achieved its object. These require the previous sanction of the Government of India. The normal minimum period of a warning is 24 hours. 12. In order that the fullest use may be made of the air arm, to act rapidly in any direction that may be required, central control is necessary, and the control of squadrons, other than those detailed to co-operate with the land forces, will not normally be delegated except for a definite and limited operation. 13. Prohibited Flying'/.one During Ofemiions.—Ww rules relating to peace time flights on the North-West Frontier of India are laid down in Government of India (Army Department) orders No. I5706/II/3 (G. S., M. 0. 1), dated the 13th November 1930. Unless a state of war with Afghanistan exists or unless the Government of India's sanction has been accorded in a special emergency, no tribal air operation justifies the violation or the risk of violation of the Afghan Frontier. The serious political consequences which are liable to result from such infringement should be strongly impressed on all concerned and in no circumstances may the prohibited zone be entered by aircraft without the special permission of the Government of India. 14. Captured Airmen. —The following uniform procedure is to be adopted by all authorities as a precaution against or in the event of an aircraft having to make a forced descent in tribal territory. [a) All personnel in Royal Air Force aircraft flying over tribal territory on a peaceful mission or on operations should carry a copy of a form translated into the appropriate language. This form, which should be obtained from the local political authority, should state that the bearer is flying on duty under the orders and protection of the Government ol India; that he is to be given good treatment and brought in safely to the nearest Government post at once upon which a suitable reward will be paid. If he is harmed, however, the Government of India will heavily punish those concerned. {b) 1 Olitical action should be taken immediately an aircraft is believed to have made a forced landing. Messengers should be sent in, and leaflets, of which a stock should be maintained, dropped to the tribes concerned, instructing them that the occupants are to be brought in. If operations are in progress against the tribe, it should be pointed out that these operations are going to continue, in any case, until the tiibe has submitted, and that if any prisoner is harmed heavy punishment will be exacted. (c) The reward to be paid will necessarily vary with the circumstances. It should be promptly paid, and its amount should be at the discretion of the political authorities concerned. {d) Officers and others flying on duty should carry always a printed card with phrases in Pushtu which are likely to be useful in the event of a forced landing.

Copy of Oraers issued to Officer Com manding, No/ 203 (Flying Boat) Squad ron. 1. Air Ministry have informed me that the British Government have requested that action by aircraft against tne Jaalan fort should be preceeded by a demonstration. This is in line with the general plans v»hich we discussed together on the M Cha.K;la% I suggesttnat wnen the sloops arrive off Sur, or at wnatever moment you consider most suitable, aircraft snould proceed to Jaalan and drop proclamations on the village and the fort. This would constitute the best possible form of demonstration. 2. I attacn herewith a draft proclamation which I tninK. might be suitable. If you approve of the word ing, can you arrange to have it translated into the local Arabic and printed ready for use? I suggest that about 500 copies shoula. be printed. 1 do not is.now whetner there is a printing press at Muscat, but if there is any diffi culty we could no doubt arrange to get them printed for you at Basrah. It would be better to get them printed at Muscat if possible, because tnen the proclamations could be translated and written in the local dialect. However, if that cannot be done, will you please signal your approval to tne wording of tne proclamation and I will arrange to have it translated and printed at Basrah. 3. ^ I also attach a draft bombardment warning /.nich, if you approve will be dealt with in the same way. 4. I also send you herewitn a copy of the orders I am issuing to the Officer Commanding, No. 203 (Flyingiky Boat) Squadron. as you see, I have laid, down that bombing is to be restricted to tiie fort. At this stage no action should be taten against tne village itself, I have tnerefore instructed Welsh tnat nis object is to destroy the fort. 5. I wisn, however, to emphasise strongly tnat it will be worse than useless to stop the bombi-ng before adequate damage has been done to the fort, and this is a point which can only be decided by the Officer Commanding, No. ^03 Squadron. I therefore urgently request that once he has started tne bombardment of the fort ne should be permitted to continue until ne reports tnat sufficient damage has been aone. I calculate tnat it will taJte at least a weeK and probably more to achieve this object. The fort is well built and will stand quite a lot of itnoc.^- ing aoout, 6. There snould be no loss of life whatever as the bombardment warning should ensure tnat the people will all clear out and stay out until tne bombing is over. It is emphasised tnat tne bombing is to destroy the fort cind should be stopped as soon as that object has oeen achieved. It is INOT our intention to continue bombing until tne Shaikh maK.es his submission or opens negotiations. When the fort has been sufficiently destroyed a letter snould be sent to tne SnaiKn informing mm tnat the bombing nas terminated and that no furtner bombardment will t&amp;Ke place witnout another warning. 7. The only anxiety I nave is for tne posts of Muscat Levies covering the anchorage of Jvhor Jorama, I fear tnere'may be a tendency to ta^e inadequate mea sures lor the security of these posts. It is quite probable tnat the Bani Bu Ali, whose nistory proves them to be an enterprising people, will attempt to rusn tnese posts, eitner at night or in the early morning, if they thinK; there is any prospect of success. The only satis factory method of guarding against this contingency is' by the use of barbed wire entanglements all the way round each post and by building the posts in a proper manner. I have asKed the Officer Commanding, No. 203 Squadron, to look into this matter personally and to satisfy nim- self that the posts are adequately defendea before he maK .es any use of tne anchorage, even for the storage of bombs. I recognise that it would not be desirable for Group Captain Welsh to have any executive power over the liuscat Levies, anu I nave told him therefore to maxe nis recommendations if necessary to you, and trust you will see fit to have the appropriate orders issued to tne Offi cer Commanding tne Levies. It is obvious that notning could be more disasterous than tnat tne Bani Bu Ali should obtain even some small success against the forces of tne Muscat State, and it snould be quite impossible for any thing oi that xind to happen if adequate precautions are taxen by the Levies.

Sur, Sunday,6th March 1932. To P.R. 1 It may be as well at this stage to consider beforehand what courses of action we should take in the event of certain eventualities and the following are suggestions for your approval. 2. Alban has just reported that Shaikh Ali should arrive at Sur today. Presumably he will arrive to 4 discuss 1 matters. Having issued our i ultimatum the time for 'discussion 1 has passed, and it only remains for Ali to comply with them, or take the consequences. We should make sure / however, that Ali has received our ultimatum of Friday night: it may possibly have missed him on nis way down, though the w/ali was asked to instruct the messenger to take the road by which Ali is generally known to visit Sur. when we near tnerefore that Ali has arrived in Sur, h. H, might send nim a short note enclosing copies of the letters sent on Friday night, M from which you 7 ill see that you have till tomorrow - Monday - at noon to inform us of your intention not to oppose a Customs Post at Aiqa'. 3. If in reply to this Ali asks for an interview with n.n. and yourself, jfetaadr I thinks it might be granted, provided he comes on board H.H 1 s ship for the purpose. If he asks for a safe conduct he might' be given it. xhe chief use of the interview would presumably be for Ali to be impressed, if he did not seem already sufficiently impressed, with our2 determination to back the State to the full. 4. One point which Ali may raise will be whether the original terms offered him oy the State still hold good; we would be quite justified in saying ^o 1 , that is by his rebellious attitude he has caused the State and ourselves to concentrate forces against him, the former generous terms no longer hold good. i do not thinlc, however, that it would be advisable at this juncture to complicate the situation by devising new terms, and i suggest that the old ones might hold good till Monday at noon. Ali could be informed to this effect. We will thus be treating him with the utmost leniency and forbearance, and giving him every opportunity to give way. 5. If he gives way, the post will be established at Aiqa tomorrow, and in the same place as formerly intended. It is very suitable for present purposes onc/n as it is in full view of the ships. The ciai» question of its permanent accommodation can be settl ed later. 6. This having been done^, presumably the Et^cdiLien packs up and goes home, and we wait to see if the B.B. A. molest the post or not. 7. If Ali does not give in then bombardment at Aiqa, and bombing at Balad begins on Wednesday, and the situation on wednesdayjwill be th«yAiqa fort will have to ue destroyed^ and the i^alad fort in a similar condition or perhaps needing another bombing visit or two. jror the forts to be destroyed it is not necessary of course thati they should be. 3 V ra«red to the ground: all that is required is that sufficient damage should have been done to make them incapable of defence. if this is accomplished at Balad, then vis&amp; vis ther^ rgmqina the B.ii. nassan, who will be glad to take the opportunity of giving them a knock, the power of the B..b. Ali would seem to be definitely affacted. 8. when the Balad fort has been destroyed, prima facie the present mission of the F.Bs. has been accomplished, and they could return to Muscat where of course they are dw easy flight of here if required for any purpose. The mission of the Muscat Infantry, first guarding the R.A.F. bombs and petrol, and second guarding the F.Bs, will also have been accomplished and they can presumably be withdrawn. The R. A.F. will have to decide^ what they want done with the petrol and whatever bombs are left. r VVvt % (a ' 9. To return to Aiqa. Under notice of bombardment the people of Aiqa will undoubtedly 4 evacuate their quarters', presumably on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning before neen» and may come to Maqarmitain. Possibly I have discussed this point with H.H. the best solution will be to allow the women and children Maqarmitain to come in to Skx for food and water, and forbid the men who xkx can shift for themselves. 10. we have still the establishment of the uustoms rest in Aiqa to consider, and I have discussed this point with n.n. and the Wali. un Thursday morning there will presumably be no one in Aiqa. Thirty . five Askaris who are now garrisoning the new uustom House will be sent to occupy four of the six small 6t mvi^W/Vw^ rv'K i{ n* forte which defend Aiqa from the west, and aleo commad- ed it, and its water supply, in fact these forts may be said to be the key of Aiqa. xf the Askaris are tfw Aiqa 'far dow-ft from /ftp $ ttnfxXsauL Aiqa will be bombarded, and ii any i^ani 3u Ali are occupying une lor^s, tne latter will be bombarded, (Only four fvt c fee*. Uci of the forts would seem to beca41ji essential, and one of those ^rhich is not essential will be bombarded. I imagine that this example will be quite sufficient to eject the B.B .A from the remainder.). When the AskarieAaVe occupied the forts the Customs Post will be established. This should be done by Thursday evening, and the main object of the operation will be accomplished. .v njwl tfjj ; 11 The expelled inhabitants of Aiqa will then presumably JnaxjuskEt ask to be allowed to return to their quarters. This might be permitted, H.H. suggests, on suitable guarantees being taken that they meant to behave themselves 12. Smarting under his punishment Ali may stages come back and make an immediate attack on Aiqa and Sur- though I thank this unlike /y, more especially as he will have the B.B.H. on his rea^r. Still the sloops might remain until Friday evening or Saturday morning to see which way the B.B.A. cat jumps. If there is no news of the cat jumping towards Sur by Saturday morning, the sloops might leave, leaving perhaps one behind for a few ^ore day to watch the developments. 13. I have left the Muscat Infantry in the air (see para 8 above). Whether they should be employed for a short time locally, or return to Muscat straightwa-y- is a matter T should like to discuss with you.letter from Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah A1 Hamuaah to His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, the Sultan of Muscat.

Since the events of November 1928, no action of a drastic nature has been ta^en to deal with the situation, but the general position has altered to some extent for Mohamed bin Naser, joint Sheikh of the Bani bu Ali, died shortly after the events referred to, leaving his uncle Ali (who was actually younger than Mohamed) as sole Sheikh of the tribe. II* POLITICAL RESIDENT'S VIEWS - HOVmiBEH 1928. 3. On 24th November 1928, the then Political Hesiaent telegraphed to the Government of India that the situation at Sur must be con3iaered to be a domestic problem of the -Uascat State, but in advancing this opinion he left it to be inferred that H.I^.Government should assist the State in some way to solve the problem. The question was how far E.M.Government were prepared to advance on the policy, then bein^ followed, of bolstering up the Mascat State. III. POSITION DURING 1929 to JMILRY 1980. 4. Throughout 1929, it was recognised by everyone concerned that the situation at Sur was mo t unsatisfactory. In January 19 -30;, the i olitical Resident addressed t despatch to iiie Government oi Indin d eaUn with the whole question of Uascat. In this despatch he maae proposals for dealing with Sur, but as the posicion at that .ort was of a long standing nature he did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by taking action in a hurry.

TO .307^ 6# On 6th August,1930, the Political ..iesldent visited 3ur in H.U.S, ^THlAJD'# He met the various sectional leaders at the Jenebeh and advised them to settle thfilir differences. He promised to return to visit them later in the year. They seemed disposed to lay their quarrels before some neutral arbitrator for settlement. They were informed that Sheikh All of the Ban! bu Ali t the self-styled Amir of Ja , alan f was himself a dependent of Mascat and had no authority to Interfere In their affairs. Furthermore they were informed that his independence would never be reooenised by the British Grovemment, whatever overtures he might mate with that object in view. 7* On 1 0th August,1930, the Political Resident reoeivod Sheikh All of the Bani bu All on board ''TaiAD'* at 3ur« The Sheikh was accompanied by ohollch I&amp;hamed (Mullah) and Sheikh Khamls of the Genedah Section of the 3ani bu All. At the end of a lone drawn out conference, during which 'bd£h .Uohomed, the Mullah, used all his powers of persuasion to prevail on 3hei&amp;i All to be sensible, the latter agreed to haul down the tfahabi/ ^•alan rlag and to replace it by a I^Iasoat flag at Aiqa. He i|lso admitted tliat he had no claim to be independent of the State of Ma^cat, or to collect customs on his own accouni;, The private rlag was strudl; aocordlnrly and so far as is known the lifciscat flag has flown at Aiqa ever since. 3.

He alix) wiiiied to persuade them to register their dhows* A conference was'arranged, but the 3ani bu All tribal representatives refu ed to attend. Instead of authorised representatives they aent low class natives to meet Salyid Sa'id. They evidently intended to insult aim. The i/ali o. 3ur (3aiyid 3aid bin Badur) was aent to Aiqa to prevail upon the leaders to abide their promi es to attenu the meeting. 3eif is a weak individual and dia not exert his influence or authority to the desired end, so his mi sion failed. 3aiyid 3a , id had no force at his aispo aj. to compel the Aiqa leaders to obey him, and so he had to leave Sur without having achieved the object of his visit. On his return to Ma cat he ordered the armed vessel AL SAID to proceed to sea to intercept ..iqa dhows, then on their way o ait with, cargo from Ba rah.

Hie results oV nearly two years' quiet work may be summed up as follows (i) The inter-sectional blood feuds of the Jenabeh referred to at 5 (a) above have ben settled. (ii) A paramount 3heilch of the Jenebeh has been appointed and is reoocnised by ttie Jenebeh sections as oheixh of Huqrimatain (see 5 (b) above). (iii)(ill) 3hellch All was persueaed In iiU^uet 1930 to reoo^nloe the suzerainty of the Crovornment Masoat (see 5 (c) above)• It appears, however, that his acoeptanoe of this principle was not whole hearted and It seexas that he agreed to It with reserv tions - possibly beoause ^e oonferenoo too&gt;c plaoe on board one of •M # ohlps # (iv) Sheilch All definitely agreed to haUL down the ^ahabl flag at Aiqa in 193 and has since flown the Masoat State flag. It does not appear, ho ever, that the flying of the Maacat flag Is oonalaered by hln to /dve that Goverment any olaln to exerol e le«al rights in ^Iqa or in Ja f alan territory. (See 6 Id) above). (vj The oustoai adiiinistration at 3ur, or rather on the ifiaqrlwatain siae of Jur, has been tightened up considerably. See 5(c) above). A new ou^toma hou &gt;e has been ere oted near 'ttie entrance of the Creek. 13. These results, suoh as they are, have been achieved without any active display of force. But it must be realised that the principal actors on the side of the Ma^cat State have had on several occasion the moral support of H*K*3hlpa f known by the local people to be in the vicinity, furthermore, frequent visits have been paid to the neighbourhood of 3ur by H.M. Ships In Uie ordinary course of duty, or for the benefit of the health of the respective 3hipiJ , companies. vii. g its ikt mfo-m ok jiriuuan .miv max d ii? iicv!'.!?.:.: im r- 6 14. ^11 political and finuncial authorities agree that lur is a problem vital to the tate of l^a cat. itoe tf de facto' 1 ruler of the 3tate - aiyid 3a f id bin Talmur - has given evidence of capacity to rule and of determination &gt;o solve the many problems which confront him in his task. His proceedings at our, or rather those in reference to Jliqa have precipitated a oris! , but the crisis was bound to ari ^e sooner or later. Apparently the Government of India are prepared to continue to bolster up the State of ilascat, as it exists to-dayj in fact there sterns to be no alternative for If the State disintegrated,a possibility which is ever present, the earefully built up position of the Indian Govemne:it on the Horth-Kast coa^t of Arabia would collapse, and short of reliquisiiing their interests on tnet coast into other hands, which mi^ht not be too frienaly or 'l.'oo easy to deal with, the hands of the Government are forced by the turn of events. lo. In short the State of J.i iscat must not be aJLlowed to disintegrate; if the our/Alqa/Banu by All problem is not solved in the near future cUbaintegration of the State is assured, tka&amp;e solution of the problem must be found. It is an urgent necessity and is vital to the very existence of the State.' .&gt;v.

Again, once the Bani bu All have succeeded in flouting directly end deliberately the authority of the Ma scat Government with impunity, they mirht feel them selves strong enough to push home the advantage. It is easy to visualise that Sheikh All might attack the «Vall of 'Ur, mi^ht Interfere with the lately established order in Muqrlmataln and in doin^ so would probably upset In one blow the good work which has been effected so carefully and tactfully durin.; the past two yesrs.

Thirty levies under Saiyid Saif bin Badur had been sent by seo to 3ur , but had returned to Ma neat a few days later without having accomplished anything. 23. Sheikh All had addressed a truculent letter the Council of Ministers calling upon it to release the Aiqa dhow captured early in Kovembcr. In reply he wns informed that the Political iiesiuent and JtJlyid Se'ld would be coming about 13th December to discuss the matter with him, Sheikh All therefore marked tine at -alqa, tov Alqa t while the Polltioal xi© si dent (who had resisted proposals put forwara frora the I^asoat that 3hips should lismedlately co-operato with the State forces) put himself In oonDaunloatlon with the Home and Indian Governments.

Throu hout the conference the utmost good humour prevailed, and the claim or bo^Ji sides were clearly and frankly stated. 27. ■ \ iiheikh iChfuals or the ^enedah stated the case for the Bani bu All duriiifj the first hour or more. The others said little, but obvioualy approved of the points he endeavoured to make and of his uncompromising attitude. 28. The Political Resident opened the discussion by stating that all ortsanised bodies had certain rights and duties* The llascat State had its ri hts and its duties to perform, the Sheikh of the Banl bu a .11 had his rights as such and also his duties. The State as such had rlights alon^ the coast and was proposing to uphold those rights, Ihe Bani bu All were at prenecfc engaged In usurping then. Inland the BBascat State had its ri ht s, but if tho e rl^ta were recognised in theory it had no intention of interfering with the established order or the authority of the tribal chieftains. *.11 rhe State required of the Banl bu All was recognition of its suzerain authority over the territories occupied— by the tribe aad gyeorantoea that there ould be no interference with the direct control it proposed to exercise alone' coast* In other words the Beni bu All were being required to reco^nl:je now, onceand for till, ttie ri, ht of the State to establish customs posts, collect customs dues, and to insist on the re^i tration of all dhows, 29# In opening his ca e Sheilch Khemls agreed that everyone had rights - God had rights, the British had ritjhts, the Muscat Steite had rights and al^o the Beaii bu ill! haa ri. hts. But he went on to state that the Ikiascat Government had no ri hts over the coast occupied by the Banl bu All tribe, nor had they any rijihte over the tribe itself. The Banl bu Ali were subjects of the British Government who alone had any authority over them, ®hey wore not, never had been, and never would be subjects of the Ma scat State, His Highness had no authority over them whatsoever, j 30, It was pointed out to him that the Banl bu Ali were not British subjects and that he could not prove his statement to this effect. On the contr ry they were, and always had been, subjects at Ma scat as eviaence by their payment of customs in the past, bv the number of occasions on ^hich uhey had fought in the ranlts of the uliian, by uhe oanuul sub idy which w^ s paid to tiieir oheiich in recognition of past services, and by the privileges as to the import of goods, free of duty, whichare accorded to the Ghei&amp;h in his capacity as regional ruler on behalf of the Government, 31, ohejUths IChamis, Mohamed and 11 insisted on their status as British subjects. If asked by the British Goverment to establish customs posts for the collection of revenue for that Government they would willingly agree, They would do anything for the British, fhey maintained that they had never reco&amp;nised the over- lordship of Itfascat - they were always indepenaent of that State - they had sometimes been compellea to pay taxes and customs under duress, in fact .hqr would not admit that such dues T /ere ever paid by cheir tribe at Aiqa, or anywhere else, in such a way as to admit the Itfei ;oat claim to collect the money as of ri^ht. If Maacat lilced to pay oheikh ^.11 an annual sub.iidy that was the Stated affair; it was not evidence a^ain t the Ban! bu All; it merely showed that ii,H, Govern.xeiit had some interest in doing ao, or alternatively that it owed the money. As for the money itself the .jheiiih did not want it, a small sub ;idy here anu there dia not interest him in the least. He had plenty of money ana could well do without the subnidy if the fact of its payment encouraged the &gt;tate to maice extravagant claims to Jurisdiction over the -Ban! bu Ali and their own seaport Aiqa, The events of the past had cheated no precident so far as they were concerned.■ 32.

The 3heiich and his aavisers liitlmtited that they did nou need time to thin}: the matter over; they regretted that H # U«Goverment should be behind the State; but their minds were made up ana they would resist any attempt by H # ii # Government to force them to -ive way on any point. If this involved them with khe British, it waa an aiionour to fijit such an I^apire and they did no^ care what losses they suffered in such an honourable struggle. 33# At this sta^e the Political Hesident drew oheilch 14aiiomed aaide for a private talk, sheikh Mahomed's influence is great and he had done little during the conference, but to look on in t -ood-humoured approval. Later the Political Resident and Sheikh Malaomed were joined by Lia^lor Fowle, 3aiyld a 1 id and Sheikh Ali. 1!hese five entered into a further long discussion during which the whole position was re-stated and an offer was made to viheikh Ali to double his su sidy. It became clear in due course that all Sheikh Mahomed's influence was thrown on the side of :f no compromise'. Ali himself could not be shaken ana so it became evident that there would be no profit in discussing the matter any longer. At 3.0 p.m. the con i'ere nee broke up t having been in session for about four hours. The Ban! bu Ali iheikhs had not given way on one single point. 34.

Peaceful persuasion has failed and it is evident that Cover merit are prepared to authorise the employment of naval forces to assist the to scat Government in the task which lies before it. 39, It is also possible that H.M # Government visualise the employment of the itoyal ^Ir Force in this affair. 40, It is for the political authorities to soy how . far the Bani bu All will submit to pressure exerted by the Mascat State Forces, supported by the loyal Kavy and the aoyal ziir Force. 41, H.M.Governme t has reserved to itself for further consideration the question of what forciole measures are to be taken, having regard to the effect of the warning given to 3heikh Ali# 42, It should be no^ed that the Bani bu Ali are Shafiti in Politics and belon c to the ./ahabi sect, where s the Ruling family of Mascat are Hinawi in politics and have been for two centuries the real or nominal heads of the Ibadhi sect. The political and religious outlook of the Bani bu Ali suggests that there will be little sympathy for them, or their cause, in the hearts of the Hinawi xiiam of 'Oman, or of their clo e neighbours the Hinawi and Ibadhi Bani bu Hassan tribe. On the political and reli ious sice, therefore, the l^ascat Government is in a somewhat more favourable position to deal with them i than mi ht be at first supposed. 43, It must bo conceded, however, that the lani bu Ali had a tradition of more or less sucoessful fi, hting history behind them - they are said to be brave fighters, well armed and enjoy a reputation for nilitary prowess, such as none of their neighbours enjoy. 44, The Political Ues.uent is informing the Iiidian Government nov that unless ■ heikh Ali surrenders his claims before the beginning of February, it is more than probable that it will be necesuiry to uce force in support of Mascat, and he will recommenu that the necessary authority to U'&gt;e force may be conveyed to all concerned in due course.A. 4S, rhe idea is t the kascat tate : oroos should proceed to 3ur early In February, and iihould land there, Ships should be pro senU to tsupport the State, 46 # If ohel/Ji ^11 Is at Aiqa, an ultimatum should be presented to him, st; tin £ that whether he agrees or not the Masoat forces will proceed on the expiry of 48 hours to establish a cusc ms post and fort at Aiqa. He will be warned that if he reoistr. his fort will be blown down by shell fire from one of K.M.Ships and that the wall guarding the entrance to the village will be destroyed. Once the customs post is est bll hed he will be wa«ned that he is not to interfere with it on pain of similar penalties. He will al o be warned that if he does anythine to prevent the establishment of the post the i&lt;oyal Air Force aircraft will bomb Balad 3ani bu All, his capital. It is proposed that the aircraft should operate from Lashkharah, so that there may be no mistake about the objective. 47. If 3heikh iai is in the interior he will be given a similar warning, but the time limi* of the ultimatum will be extenued to four day3. 48. It is not beyona the bounds of pojssibility that the 3ani bu Hassan, who live at Balad or the same name, even miles away from Balad Bani bu iili, mi» ht be very lad to harass 3heikh Ali if they found him in a difficulty.

The Jenebah at Sur are stated to be loyal and would be able to raise 1000 rifles. The Bani bu Hassan of Balad Bani bu Hassan are reported to be in a position to raise 1000 rifles, and it is stated that they might be glad of an opportunity to harass their old rivals' 'tnV Bani bu Ali if a suitable opportunity presented itself. They are loyal to the Mascat State to the extent that they pay taxes and use Sur, rather than Aiqa as their trading port. RELATIVE VALUi. OF OP. Q3ING FOROiiiS. It is difficult to say. Bani bu Ali might be inferior, in numbors, but having central control and in their opinion a good cause, vrould be expected to resist stoutly. The Bani bu Hassan and Jenebah might be easily discouraged. The 'AL 3AID' is practically valueless, particularly as the Aiqa trading dhows are now on the ijiast African Trade Route, except the one retained at Mascat. It,It is stated tiiat 3iieilda Ali would have to divide his forces to watch the Bani bu Hassan, ■ iqa It is considered that if Bani bu Ali were driven out of Aiqa the place could be held by a detachment of Levies, 3heiidi Ali is expected to fight rather than lose his free port, but the bombing of his capital and possible threat of Bani bu hassan might compel him to loose his grip on Aiqa, so soon as he appreciated that the British Government had joined forces with Mascat.r^ 0 (Enclosure I^o. 4 to Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf letter dated 20th December, 1931, No,303/612) mmui qjf am m In paragraph 31, page 7. of India Office Paper B*416/P.6015/28, tie icllowing statement is made:- n In 1913 Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim al iilawi died....

T-b4 # dated the 8th March 1932, regarding the action recently taicen at Sur, and to submit a report on the subject for the informa tion of the Government of India and of His Majesty^ Government. 2. On receipt of Govemment of India telegram Mo. 546 of the 18th February, authorising me to take action as proposed in my Kxpress Letter of 18th December, Mo. C-41, I arranged with the Air officer Commanding and the senior Maval Officer for ships and flying boats to rendezvous at Muscat on the 2nd March. I may mention that a preliminary reconnaissance had already been carried out by flying boats and land machines of the Royal Air j?orce and the latter had flown over Jaalan and obtained some excellent photo graphs of the fort and village. This showed that the fort was a most conspicuous land mark, well clear of the village « I and anlideal target for bombing. Opportunity was also taker to make a reconnaissance of the iChor Jarama and Has al Kadd area and to test the landing grounds at Bait al Jalaj near Muscat/-2- ' V Muscat and Ras al Hadd* Captain Alban, as Couunandant of the Muscat Infantryj accompanied the aircraft to lOior Jarama and Ras al Hadd and over the Bani Bu Ali country. Unfortunately, during this reconnaissance one Wapiti crashed on the coast near Quryat, about 40 miles a) uth of Muscat^ but the occupants escaped unhurt ana were sub sequently brought in to Muscat by a dhow which was sent for them. They had a narrow escape as the land there is a tangle of broken hills, and it was a fortunate chance that when their engine petered out they happened to be over about the only place where landing was in any way feasible^ 3* I left Bu shire by mail steamer on the 28th February and transhipped to H.M.b^ 'bhoreham** which the Senior Naval Officer kindly sent to meet me off $ax\ir Island the following afternoon. The Residency Agent was on board and I was able to have a discussion with him regarding Trucial Coast matters. We dropped him at Rasr al-Khaimah on the 1st March and arrived at Muscat on the 2nd .MaJBja There I found His Majesty's ships ^iedford^ and 'Fowey* and three flying boats of Ho. 203 Squadron, rhe tienior Naval officer had arrived by mail steamer from Bombay while sx^P Group Captain Welch had arrived by air from Basra, It had been decided that flying boats should use Khor Jarama as a base and petrol, oil, bombs, et«,, had already been sent out there in some dhows which were escorted by the 'Al Saidi* 4 carrying 100 men of the Muscat Infantry under the command of Captain Alban. These men were to guard the stores and flying boats when they landed at Khor Jarama in view of the possibility of the Bani Bu Ali attacking them. Pickets were established on some of the hillocks surrounding the khor, while the ^hciiich ox Has al Hadd sent out a screen of guards to a distance of about 15 miles towards the Bani Bu Ali country/-3- country to bring in news of any movementB from the direction of Jaalan. 4, on the 3rd karch I presented to His Highness the Sultan the kharita congratulating him on his accession sent to him by His excellency the Viceroy with suitable ceremony, of which I have sent a report separately, and that evening the three sloops left for Aiqa y H*M*S« *Bideford'* flying the flag of His Highness the Sultan, who was accompanied by tlie jPolitical Agent, while I travelled in H .M .S. 'bhorehanr 4 and the Senior xiaval ufficw and Group Captain Welch in H *M«£&gt;. ''iPowey**# 5, we arrived at Aiqa on the 4th• Jihaikh Ali had already been notified of my intended arrival and of the determination of the Muscat state to establish the customs post, but had not himself come down to the coast. It was not considered necessary in th«ee circumstances to await his arrival and it was thought desirable to take prompt action and to show that the time for negotiations had passed. A letter was therefore sent ashore by His Highness to the people of Aiqa informing them that the customs post would be established and soon after a guard consisting of four men bearing the Muscat flag landed at Aiqa. There, however, they met with a hostile reception from some forty of the inhabitants, were threatened with rifles and a dagger was taken away from one of them and they therefore retired to 3ur» ness addressed a letter to shaikh Ali informing him that the Muscat State had sent some customs officers to Aiqa to establish the post there in accordancw with former custom, and that his tribesmen at Aiqa had threatened the customs/customs guard with rifles and refused to allow tnem to remain. He (Shailch Ali) was warned that unless he sent instructions to his people not to resist the establish ment of a customs post the fort at Aiqa would be des troyed 'by ships and the fort at Balad Bani Bu Ali bombed by aeroplanes, and th^t the people of Ai qa should tome on board the ship and inform His Highness by noon on the 7th March that they were willing to accept the customs post* X also aent a letter to the liliLiikh into rmmg him that the Sultan^ demands had the approval of His Majesty's Government, who were prepared to support theau It was necessary to give the people of Aiqa time till Monday morning in order to i* rmit of a message reaching Jaalan, where the shaikh was, and bring a reply. A copy of these letters was sent ashore to the people of ^iqa. A reply was received from the people of Aiqa ask ing His Highness' forgiveness and pardon and saying they would give an answer on Monday* 7, The following day it was decided to carry out an aerial demonstration over Jaalan, and to drop pamphlets giving a preliminary warning to the people that if they resisted the fort would be bombed. I there fore proceeded with Group Captain Welch on the bth in H .M .S. 'Fowey* to JOior Jarama, where three flying boats had arrived from Muscat. Group Captain welch kindly allowed me to accompany the flight and the three flying boats proceeded down the coast to Jumailah whence we struck inland to Balad Bani Bu Ali. On arrival I was able to see for myself the extensive date groves owned by the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan tribes in this fertile valley and also the fine fort belonging to the former. Having dropped the pamphlets we returned directto Khor Jarama and then went on without landing Aiqa* over which pamphlets were also dropped, and then we tixen returned again to Khor Jarama, There I inspected one or two of the pickets of the Muscat Levy Corps and saw the arrangements made by Captain Alhan for the protection of the Royal Air ?orce base. It is certainly a very much better place than Muscat for flying boats and I believe the Royal Air Force intend to use it in preference to the latter in connection with the Aden air route. I was told that a good deal of smuggling went on through the khor and that it was the intention of the Muscat State to establish a customs post there. This would have the advantage a&amp; in addition to stopping smuggling that the guards could assist the Royal Air Force, while visits by flying boats from time to time would afford moral support to the guards. I then returned in H.M.b. 'Fowey' to Aiqa, and arrangements were finally completed to take action against the Bani Bu Ali should they prove recalcitrant. 8, It was decided that if they did not send a satisfactory reply by noon on the 7th March action would be taken kgainst them at daybreak on the 9th, and that an ultimatum to this effect di ould be issued by the Senior Kaval Officer to the people of Aiqa, while the flying boats xtox would drop the final warning over Jaalan on the morning of the 8th, telling the people to remove their women and children to a place of safety. 9. However, on the evening of the 6th Shaikh Ali arrived at Aiqa and the following morning sent a letter to His Highness the Sultan which was most truculently worded. In it, after acknowledging receipt of His High ness 1 letter, he wrote: M You have hastened here before '♦my arrival and your promise was for the end of the of the/-6- ♦•the month, and you are warning us for fighting. I see 'you want that. If you wish to fight without a cause w then do as youlike. Injustice will punish her own 'children. Moreover the flag was not mentioned in your 'conditions nor in those of the resident 11 . To this His Highness replied that the shaikh must accept the estahliehment of the customs poet hy noon and if he did not receive a reply by that time it would be under stood that he intended tcjoppose the post. As regards the flag the Shaikh was informed that it was the custom oft State to fly their flags over all their customs posts in all their ports. The Shaikh's objection to a flag being flown over the customs house was quite illogical, since the Muscat flag is always, and when he wrote his letter, flown over ^iqa fort. 10. To this the shaikh replied in a lettei/in which he repiated the terms which had been offered to him by the State at the interview in December last; but did not express his readiness to accept the customs post, but stated that he would not come off to the ship to see His Highness but was prepared to discuss matters ashore either at Aiqa or at Sur. A meeting of this nature would certainly have been derogatory to His Hi^iness 1 dignity, and it was evident that the shaikh was endeavon* ing to prolong discussions, the time for which had passed, and to evade the issue. lip This letter w^s not received till about 2 p.m., that is two hours after the time given for acceptance had passed. When it was received His Highness therefore had aready written him a letter which had not yet been sent ashore saying that, as he had not complied with his orders by noon, the fort at Aiqa would be bombarded and the i ort at Jaalan bombed by aeroplanes but that in order t#/-7- Jenn^bah Shaikhs from aur went over fclnR to Aiqa and apparently told the Bani Bu All that it was rediculous to try and resist and that they had much better climb down, and/ to enable his tribesmen to escape from danger this would not be done till Wednesday morning, and he enclosed for his information a notice addressed by the aeniAr Kaval Officer to the people of Aiqa and also a notice to be sent to the people of Jaalan. The notice issued by tiie Senior i^aval officer was to the effect that the fort would be bombarded four hours after sunrise on March 9th arxi that anyone remaining in the town after that time would do so at the peril of his life, whilej/the notice regarding Jaalan was a copy of that which was to be dropped the following morning by the aircraft over that toun# To His Highness 1 letter I added one from myself to the shaiJch advising hiia to make peace while tlx re v;as yet time. On receipt of Shaikh Ali^ letter mentioned above His Highness therefore addressed another letter to him infoiming him that the time for the discussion of terms and conditions had passed and that he required four men of the Bani Bu Ali to come off to the ship and take the customs guard ashore to Aiqa. He reiterated thaijthe Muscat State had the right to fly its flag any of its official buildings and stated that the future conditions to be granted to the Bani Bu £11 depended on their future behaviour. If they behaved as loyal subjects of the State the Muscat btate would treat them well, but if they persisted in their rebellious attitude they would be punished. Both letters were sent ashore together with the notices of bombardment. IS. That evening prolonged discussions took place at Aiqa between the Shaikh and his tribesmen and I under stand that some at any »ate were in favour of withdrawing to the interior and refusing to accept the Stated demands. During the dipcussion, however, some half a dozen of the-8- and this opinion carried the day. If this version which** was reported to me is correct, it furnishes a typical example of the difficulty of dealing with these semi- savage trihes of 'Oman, and shows how easily they are swayed Toy outside influence# When I prevailed upon Shaikh Ali to haul down his own flag and to fly the Muscat flag in August 1930, it was largely due, as I reported at that time, to the conciliatory attitude adopted hy 'Inniirli Ahdulla Rawwaf, a local priest. My failure to arrive at a *1** settlement last December I attribute largely to the same cause. Mis Highness the bultan was convinced on the present occasion that the Bani Bu Ali would not climb down as the loss of face would be very great, but the outside influence of certain Jennebah Shaikhs turned the scale, coupled, I believe, with that of Rawwaf, who hadjfcome to the conclusion that he had miscalculated the determination of His Majesty's Government. 13. Anyhow, early An the morning of the 8th, the Sultan and I both received letters from shaikh Ali, in which he said that he noted that His Highness required four men of Aiqa to land along with the officers in order to establish the customs post antf to fix the flagstaff. They were being sent as desired. His Highness replied that the four men had arrived and he had sent for the customs officers who would be sent to Aiqa in due course to fix the flagstaff and establish the customs post. To this he received a reply from the shaikh saying: M I have •♦accepted your demand about hoisting the flag on the roof 'bf the house which is arranged for the four persons. 'Please send them on*, and about noon on 8th March the md customs guards were escorted ashore and the Muscat flag Ms* hoisted over the post, which has been established in a small enclosure at the entrance of the creek which the Bani Bu Ali had themselves built in order to enable them to levy illegal/—9— illegal dues or|€lhow8 enteringw 14. After this had 'been done His Highness wrote to Shaikh Ali offering him safe conduct to come on board and discuss matters if he wished to do so and stated that I also would be present, while the Senior aaval uffic er simultaneously sent him a letter v^ithdrawing the bombard ment natice# Shaiich Ali, however, still declined to come off to the ship, while expressing his readiness to meet the Sultan ashore. His Highness therefore proceeded that afternoon to iQior Jarama where he ins^cted his Levy corps, and on the 9th we all left for Muscat. Before leaving His Highness wrote to fcihailch Ali informing him that the future conditions to be granted tcjhim depended on his future behaviour. He had accepted the establish ment of the customs post but he and his people had still to prove their loyalty by paying customs dues without evasion. If loyal thejr/ would be treated well. I address ed him a letter in the same sense and warned him that^Lf X the customs guard were molested or if the people tried to evade payment of customs dues it would be as though he had not accepted the post and measures would be taken against him but that if on the other hand he and his tribesmen at Aiqa acted as loyal subjects of the Muscat State Ijwas t confident that State would treat them with their customaiy generosity. To this I received a letter of which I enelos ij a copy. It will be seen that the Shaikh states definitely that he has accepted the customs post and that tnere/will be no molestation of the guards or evasion of customs dues though he adds ♦♦if the Sultan pays what is agreed 'between us'. To this last stipulation I do not think any great importance need be attached. He has been definitely informed that the former terms are no longer open to him, and I think it is merely an attempt to get something if he can. un the other hand if the Bani Bu Ali behave/-10- behave well it is the intention of His highness to con tinue the political suhsidy and the personal exemption on a specified amount of goods imported for the bhaiJch. 15* After our departure H.M.b. u Bideford u was left in the vicinity fior about a fortnight, and has visited Sur and Aiqa on the north and no incident has so far been reported to me, and, v&amp;ile I hesitate to express an opinion that there never wilibe any more trouble at Aiqa, I think the outlook is favourable, and if we have succeeded in effecting a final settlement at a place where we have had difficulties on and off for the last century we shall certainly have cause for congratulation. The xaatter »hould soon be put to the proof, since the Aiqa dhows will be returning from Africa before the monsoon, i.e. during April, arid if they pay their customs dues and accept the situation loyally a good beginning will have been made. 16. Moreover, we are in a very much stronger position nowadays to control the situation aixi to overawe opposition than we were formerly for two reasons. Firstly, there is no doubt that the flights of aircraft over Jaalan had an enormous moral effect; hitherto these tribes residing in the interior and largely self-supportin^ have considered themselves invulnerable. They now realise that they are not. If, as seems probable, the refuelling base is established at Khor Jarama and aircraft frequently visit this coast, their constant presence will prove a most useful reminder to the inhabitants of the interior. r i'he second factor is the discovery of the great climatic advantages of Khor Jarama, which is only 10 miles from Sur, in the summer for His Majesty's ships. Formerly ships seldom visited this part of the 'uman coast but now sloops are constantly sent down for ten days at a time to reouperate and, as I can myself testify, a visit to iChor j^r v -11- Jarama in the Bummer is a very '?aluat)le tonic. Tne people of Sur therefore are nowadays constantly Tisited by ships and the local children are even beginning to kick a football about and to speak a few odd words of English picked up from sailors 1 All this should have a very valuable civilizing and pacifying effect. Moreover these visits of ships enable the Muscat b^ate to keep in close touch with aur. 17 # If I may say so, I think the course of events may be regarded as sat iifactory . The Muscat State have displayed the utmost forbearance and tolerance of a gross flouting of their authority. Before extreme measures were resorted to the most generous terms were offered to shaikh Ali but when finally it was obvious that he was persisting in his former attitude an over whelming demonstration of force waa made before which he had really no alternative but to yield and which was so strong that it proved unnecessary to take action, finally the action taken was singularly opportune. A young and energetic sultan has just ascended the throne, and there is no doubt that the action taken at Aiqa will have wide repereussions and will enormously en^ince his prestige, improve the revenues of his State and facilitate his dealings with his subjects. 18« In conclusion I would venture to express my thanks to the senior fiaval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, and to Oroup Captain welch for the valuable support they have given to the political authorities in the Persian Gulf and for the harmonious manner in which they co-operated to carry out my wishes. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's/ I Jrnmmm&amp;tmm v -12- &amp; Majesty^ Secretary of State for Xndia, to tne senior Saval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, ana. the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Gororaand.

I Since writing the above I have received xruiri the Political Agent a translation of a letter addressed by His Highness the tJultan to him asking him to convey his thanks to His Majesty's Government for the valuable support they have given to him at Sur, and I enclose a copy herewith. *press coauumigm A Some time ago the Ban! Bu All, a tribe lirin^ in the interior of the Mohammedan State of Muscat and 'Oman, rebelled against the authority of His Highness the Sultan. The Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali hoisted a flag which he claimed to be his own flag at a fort at Aiqa inhabited by his tribesmen on the coast, and refused to admit the right of the Muscat State to lery customs dues as they had formerly done. The State authorities thereupon sought the good offices of the British Goyernment with a riew to composing their differences with their rebellious Tassal, and the Political Resident in the Persian Uulf met the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali at Alqa; and after some discussion the latter agreed that he would in future fly the Muscat flag at Aiqa, but the question of customs dues was left for subsequent discussion. Later on the President of the Muscat State Council met the Shaikh in the vicinity of Aiqa but though the State offered the Shaikh most generous terms and certain special concessions for himself he still persisted in his refusal to admit the right of the Muscat State to lery customs dues at Aiqa. Haring thus exhausted all measures of concilia tion His Highness the Sultan appealed to the British Gorern- ment for assistance in enforcing his legitimate rights oyer his rebellious subjects, and the latter, recognising the justice of his claim, expressed their willingness to support his authority. .»hile they were ready in the last resort ••••-2- resort to enforce the Just demands of the State the British Government hoped by the display .of overwhelming force to bring about the submission of the rebellious tribe without the necessity for punitive measurss* His Highness the Sultan therefore proceeded to Aiqa early in March escorted by His Majesty's Ships M Shoreham'»^Bideferd' and ^Fowey'* accompanied by three flying boats of the Royal Air Force. On arrival His Highness informed the Bani Bu Ali that he was determined to re-establish his Just rights at Aiqa and notices were dropped by the Royal Air Force over the chief town of the Bani Bu Ali in the interior, warning the inhabitants that His Majesty's Government supported the demands of the State and would no longe tolerate their rebellious attitude towards His Highness the u/ Si Itan^ tifhile a similar warning was given to the people of Aiqa by the Senior Naval Officer,Persian Gulf Division* These measures had the desired result without resort to force being necessary* The Shaikh came down to the coast and accepted the demands of the State 9 who were thus enabled to re-establish their customs post at Aiqa and to resume the collection of their dues* C ^ju, — , %From 3±'hH ?To•C-72 of 1932.

Correspondence discusses how the Bani Bu Ali led by Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al-Hammuda [Muḥammed bin Nāṣir al-Ḥamūdah] were rebelling against the Sultan of Muscat's authority and in particular the creation of a customs post in Aiqa. Shaikh Ali had deployed armed forces to Aiqa fort and prevented the establishment of the customs post. The timing for deployment of aircraft from Iraq including Wapitis and flying boats is discussed and in particular the implications of reconnaissance flights during Ramadan. One Wapiti crashed 40 miles south of Muscat but the occupants were unhurt and safely rescued. Saiyid Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr] visited Sur in a sloop along with HMS
                           Emerald. Correspondence details the agreement of the Foreign Office, Air Ministry and India Office in London to the use of aircraft. A letter from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty concurs in the action whilst expressing concern over the use of aircraft and the repercussions this could have on relations with Arab rulers, and suggests only use of naval bombardment. The Air Ministry responded noting the Political Resident's view that 'action by warship alone would be entirely ineffective; past history has shewn this.' The India Office notes that the action proposed by the Government of India were based on discussions with the Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf and Air Officer Commanding, Iraq; furthermore, 'aerial demonstration will precede punitive air action.'The Political Agent, Muscat discusses the relations between the Bani Bu Ali ,[Banī Bū ‘Alī] Bani Bu Hassan [Bani Bū ‘Hasan] and Bani Amer; also the likely response of the Bani Bu Ali to any British attack and the need to take precautions to avoid the experience of a British Indian force in 1821. In 1821 a force was dispatched to avenge the defeat there of a different expedition the previous year but three hundred of the Bani Bu Ali attacked at night resulting 16 killed. Correspondence discusses the negotiations with Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah bin Abdullah bin HammudaCorrespondence between the Air Officer Commanding, Edgar Rainey Ludlow-Hewitt and Colonel Hugh Vincent Biscoe, Political Resident, Persian Gulf discusses the reconnaissance photos and the bombing of the Jaalan [Ja’alān] fort following the dropping from aircraft of warning messages. There are also extracts from a report by Group Captain W L Welsh on reconnaisance by two Rangoons and three Wapitis of the Sur area with arrangements for the deployment of flying boats to conduct bombing missions and their protection by the Muscat Infantry.Correspondence includes letters betweeen Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, to Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah and Hugh Vincent Biscoe, Political Resident Persian Gulf. Following aerial demonstrations by Rangoon flying boats Shaikh Ali accepted the customs post and agreed to meet the Sultan on board the Sultan's vessel. The Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf wrote to Shaikh Ali informing him that as he had accepted the customs post the bombardment would not take place.Includes aerial photos (ff 128D-128P) of Jaalan and Khor Janaba which were made in preparation for a possible punitive bombing raid. Also includes a sketch map of Khor Janaba and an enclosure with a 'Sheikhly family of Bani Bu Ali.Correspondents include H.V.
