E. S. M. Four possible courses present themselves (I) Administration hy the Foreign Office o ,d'sfivanteges of this appear to me briefly as follows la) The I'oreign Office is not an administrative office and is not eauimwi f™- administration, e.ff.. it lias no Stores Department, no Revenue Financial or SSiiSrssxis safe; '' 11 tj' i '- i ' g '' (c) For many years to come there will be a good deal of business with foreign nations residing these countries; it is on the whole preferable that negotiations in connection should not be dealt with by the office actually responsible for the administration. Otherwise there is a danger of confusion of issues. (2) Administration hij an entirely separate Department. I lie disadvantages of this proposal appear to be— ia) Expense.^ The whole machinery of a large office would have to be set up and it Jthe posts ^ 10 get eitller the fU ' dS t0 d0 ' S0 ' 0r tIie right men 'ome (h) The^Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia, and Aden would still be wholly 'divorced from (c) There would be much overlapping; the Department would have to be housed elsewhere than in Downing Street and this would make inter-communication difficult 1 neW epai ' tmeut and the Forei « n Office and India Office more Administration by the present Colonial the Dominions coming under the Privy Council. I am little acquainted with the arguments for or against this course, but — (a) it involves a great extension of Colonial Office responsibility ill regions in which if has not hitherto been concerned ; (h) the Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia and Aden would still be wholly divorced from JIlQlcl J [c) the countries in question are not colonies, and public feeling in them might be unfavourably affected if they were even ostensibly dealt with as such. (4) Administration by the India Office, reconstituted as the India and Middle Eastern Office, with a special Under Secretary of State for the Middle East. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the constitution of the India Office, nor with the nature of the proposals now on foot for its reconstitution to be able to hazard an opinion as to how far this is practicable. It has the following advantages :— (d) I he administrative machinery and expert knowledge and experience required for the guidance and control of a British administration in the East is ready to hand and the additional staff required would not be large. The additional accommodation cbuld probably be found within the India Office. A very large sum could thus be saved. {}&gt;) Relations between India and the countries mentioned above would be co-ordinated and friction avoided. The problems arising in the above countries are closelv interconnected, and experience in one country will be of assistance in deciding questions arising in another. H For many years past the India and Foreign Offices have worked in close relations with each other in regard to Middle Eastern questions. The transfer to the India Office of the responsibility for these countries could thus be effected with a minimum of friction and loss of efficiency. id) The difficulty of obtaining technical and other personnel, and of dealing with the multifarious petty details of administration could perhaps be surmounted by the constitution of agencies (similar to those of the Crown Agents) for India and for the other countries under the India Office, which would perform the functions now fulfilled by the Director-General of Stores, (cj The proposal now before the Secretary of State to amalgamate the Indo-European Telegraph Department with Mesopotamia telegraphs and possibly with other State Telegraph Departments would be facilitated by this change. $001 March 1019.

It consists of four possible options for future arrangements for the disposal in the United Kingdom of official business relating to Egypt, Aden, Cyprus, Palestine, Persia, the Persian Gulf, and Mesopotamia. These are: (1) Administration by the Foreign Office or by a Department under the Foreign Office; (2) Administration by an entirely separate Department; (3) Administration by the present Colonial Office or by a reconstituted Colonial Office, the Dominions coming under the Privy Council; or (4) Administration by the India Office, reconstituted as the India and Middle Eastern Office, with a special Under Secretary of State for the Middle East.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00031d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
