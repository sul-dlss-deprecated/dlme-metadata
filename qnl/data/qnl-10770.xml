The majority of the correspondence is between the British Political Agent at Kuwait and the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. It includes several letters of complaint received from British companies and commercial agents operating in the Persian Gulf, mainly with regard to import and export charges levied on their shipped goods by the Kuwait Customs authorities. The Arabic correspondence in the file consists mainly of an exchange of letters between the Political Agent at Kuwait and the Ruler of Kuwait. There is also a small amount of correspondence in French from the Inspector General of Persian Customs at Bushire to the Secretary to the Political Resident at Bushire, in 1927 and 1928.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Najd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Customs administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d0#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d0#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
