He had acoompanied me to Shiraz for the summer, and was on his way to Bushire en route for Kuwait at the time. An Arab servant of mine who was travelling with him did everything that he could for him, but without effect. My servant arranged with the servant of the British Telegraph Department Rest House for him to be buried just outside the compound of the Rest House in question, near where an Englishman who died in the same village some months ago was buried. When passing through Kunar Takhteh last Sunday I visited the grave, and left money with the servant of the Telegraph Rest House to have a suitable cairn of stones and plaster built over the grave. On ay arrival at Bushire, which is 63 miles from Kunar Takhteh, I saw that full particulars of your husband's name and the position of his grave were given to the Catholic priest there, so that ifrhen next he or any other Father travels along the road, he will stop there and bless the grave. The sum of Rs. 6 o/- on account of pay for Septembei and Rs.15/8/- on account of pay for eight days of October were due to your husband from me, and I also had Krans 200 in Persian money (worth £x Rs.67/-£ whicb he had asked me to keep for him, making a total of Rs.142/8/-* In addition to the above Krans 60 in Persiaii money (worth Rs. 2 o^ were in his possession when he died. Also on opening his house in Kuwait I found, with the assistance of his friend Joseph Gabriel Fernandez, Rs. 50 /ft which he had buried under the floor and annas 12/3 loose. Thus making a grand total ofRs.at3/4/3. I ciiu maicing o/iis sxini up to ■ Rs«300/ /,, “ cts a small token of my appreciation of the deceased and to assist you and your children in your bereavement. I am accordingly re mitting Rs.3oo/- to you by money order. I am also enclosing a Post Office Savings Bank Pass, showing a credit of Rs.31/15/2, also a certificate of his death, which I hope will enable you to draw this. I also enclose a list of articles belonging to him, found in his luggage at the time of his death and in his house here, and will be glad if you will let me know whether you wish these to be sent to you, or sold by auction and the money sent. I am sending you one card and two other small pictures which I think you would like to have. With deep sympathy I remain, Yours faithfully, being amount; of money ord&lt;k payable |to [payee's name)L \ 7 , Inventory of the assets of the deceased Joseph Pedro de’Sousa, Cook to Major.J.C.More, P.B.C., Political Agent, Kuwait.

The aan in question, who was sy cook by name Jose Pedro 1 native of Goa in Portuguese India, became seriously ill - apparently with pneumonia - shortly after leaving Dasht-i- Arjin. My other servant who was with him, an Arab named Hassir, delayed the caravan for two days at SSaarQn while he tried to get in touch with me so that arrangements could be made for him to be left in Klzarfln and looked after there until he could be taken on by motor.

My chauffeur tells me that the younger ghulaa, or ferrash, who is he thinkd the son of the bearded man, told the same story to him. Their story tallied exactly with what Massar told m afterwards. By the way, I told you in ay letter of i«th October that 1 left a sum of twelve tomans with 'Avaa, the man at Kunar Takhteh, with which he promised to have a cairn of stone and gach put over the grave, which he said he would show to you when you got there.

He states that seeing how ill D*Souza was he advised I\iassar, Major More^ Arab servant, to ask the Signaller at Kazeroon to wire to his master. He knows that Nasser went at least twioe unaccompanied by him (Amir) and that asno reply came he himself then went with Nassar. This was about li hours before sunset. He describes the Signaller as a man of about 25 years of age and of medium height, but he only saw the Signaller, who was on the verandah, from the courtyard below. (Note, This description would not apply to Garapiet, though it might to Mackertich his brother-in-law). He says that he first asked AssaduLl ah Beg who went and asked the Signaller. Aniy, being a native of Kazeroon, knows Assadullah Beg well). He is prepared to confront both him and the Signaller if they deny the truth of aid his statement.

This correspondence includes an enquiry by his employer into the circumstances of his death, the arrangements for his Christian burial in Persia, and the despatch of money and possessions to his widow in Goa. The second case concerns the death of Haji bin Muhenna Hasawi, an owner of property who died in Bahrain in 1930 and who had appointed his son, resident in Kuwait, as executor of his will.
