In this letter (S.l) he stated the conditions on which he proposed co-operation with Great Britain against the Turks, and came at once to the vital matter of boundaries for the Arab State in the following words:- 'England to acknowledge the Independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by : ersina and Adana up to 57° of latitude, on which degree falls Birijik, : Jrfa, Mardin, ftidiat, Amadia Island (Jezireh), up to the border of Persia; on tne east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the south, by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the west, by the Bed Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. The last two lines of the foregoing definition clearly include Palestine.Letter from Lir Henry McMahon to King Hussein of 24th October, 1915. &amp; ”I hi've received your letter (of 9th September) ^ith much pleasure; and your expressions of sincerity and friendliness have given me the greatest satisfaction. 'I regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the boundaries ’vith coldness and hesitation; such was not the case, but it appeared to me the moment had not arrived when they could be profitably discussed. 'I have realised, however, from your last letter* that you regard' this question as one of vital and urgent ^ importance. I hove therefore lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter; and it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf the following statement which, I am confident, you will teceive ™ith satisfaction:- 'The districts of Mersina and ^lexsndretta and the portions of Hyria Iring to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. 'ith tre above modification, and. -without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs we accept these limits and boundaries, and in regard to these portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally, France, I ai empowered in the name of the Government of Great Brit-In to give the following assurances and/and make tha following reply to your letter*- 'Subject to the above modifications. Greet Britain Is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories Included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Jtecca. Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Pieces against all external aggression and will recognise their inviolability, M ?/hen the situation admits. Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish 'fhat may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those various territories, 'On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such Kuropean Advisers and officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British, / ''•'ith regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognise that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the loc!&gt;l population and to safeguard our mutual economic interests. 'I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubts of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her traditional friendsj tne Arabs, and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke which, for so many years, has pressed heavily upon themdentlal.

My dear Gilbert, I have been looking at Colonial Office letter No.79100/35, of March 14th to us enclosing a despatch and a telegram from the Resident at Aden about the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. I have also been looking at a sketch map which I understand it is proposed to complete in the near future and circulate to the various departments concerned showing the different proposals which have been made. It appears from Reilly’s despatch and telegram that there is a very strong case for fixing the northern limit of the Aden x’rotectorate, to the east of the violet lino (i.e. the hinterland frontier of the Hadramaut between the violet line and the inland terminal point of the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman), no further south than parallel 18 north, at any rate in the neighbourhood of the vldet line. Reilly also seems to me to make a strong case for including in the Protectorate a strip, at least 20 miles in width, of the Great Desert, on the Hadramaut side of any future frontier between the Protectorate and Saudi Arabia. 2. I see from the sketch map referred to above that the southern ’’edge of the sands” runs slightly (clearly more than 20 miles) to the south of parallel 18 north, and it therefore occurs to me, in the light of Reilly's telegram and despatch, that it might be better to fix parallel 18 definitely as the southern limit of any concession to be made/ lithwaite Esq., C.I.S., Lia Office, b • V . 1 •2. made to Ibn Saud in this area, rather than the edge itself of the sands as we originally contemplated. I fully realise the objections of principle, on which I have often myself insisted, to boundary lines based solely on geographical co-ordinates. But in the present case where the natural features are either non-existent (as in the desert itself) or extremely uncertain, it seems to me that there may be a strong case for making an exception and basing ourselves on geographical co-ordinates after all. This would mean that the line would come inside the sands and not follow the edge of them, but this might have the great advantage of giving us a belt of sand on the inland side of territory which we may have to protect, which would act as a kind of neutral ground and possibly enable us in case of necessity to establish advance frontier patrols or pursue fugitive raiders. 3. If we were to adopt these principles it would be necessary somewhat to modify the definitions which we have suggested to Andrew Ryan in paragraphs 9 and ic/of our telegram No.8 of January 16th, to provide that the new frontier should run due south along meridian 52 until its intersection with parallel 18, and thence due west along parallel 18 until its intersection with the violet line. 4. If thi§4&gt;rinciple were adopted in regard to this line it would I think greatly simplify matters to adopt it also for the definition of the proposed desert zone, the eastern and southern boundary of which would then be as follows: From the intersection of meridian 55 east and parallel 22 north to the intersection of meridian 55 east and parallel 20 north, thence in a straight line to the intersection/3. intersection of meridian 52 east with parallel 18 north, and thence due west along parallel 18 to its intersection with the violet line as above. 5d if this were done I think it would be well to try to fix the northern terminal of the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and Oman (the southerly terminal of which is at Ras Dharbat Ali) also at the intersection of meridian 52 east and parallel 18 north. The frontier need not of course follow a straight line between these two points, but this can be discussed later. 6. would you let me know as soon as possible what you think about this suggestion? If you think it worth pursuing I should like to take it up at once with the Colonial Office and Air Ministry in order that we may instruct Andrew Ryan as to the line he should take as a result of Reilly’s telegram No.11 of March 15th to the Colonial Office enclosed in Colonial Office letter referred to above.

GOVrrr British Legation, Jedda. 26th February 1935 Ify dear George, Many thanks for your letters E 394/318/25 of January 24th and 31st about the distinction between personal and territorial sovereignty, with special reference to the suggested desert zone. I have read the letters and Beckett’s minute of January 23rd with great interest. I appreciate the force of the 'short answer' in paragraph 1 of his minute and very much hope that if the desert zone becomes practical politics we shall be able to eschew the word 'sovereignty' in connexion with our own position* I am indeed greatly alarmed by the application of the 'sovereignty' to our position in regard to the Trucial Sheykhs and Qatar. It appears to me to be mainly a matter of words, because it is obvious that, even for international purposes, King George’s position in regard to those states cannot be precisely the same as his position in regard to the United Kingdom, either as regards his rights or his responsibilities. But 'sovereignty' is a very potent word and Ibn baud is not a lawyer. Any assertion by us that we had 'sovereignty' over the Trucial Sheykhdoms and Qatar, would cause him to throw a thousand fits. And if he were a lawyer, might he not ask how we came to speak of his maintaining 'relations' with them and with Bahrain and Kuwait in Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda? 3./ iel Jso, C.M.G., 3reign Office.3* I interrupt nyaelf to comment on the third sentence of paragraph 3 of your letter of January 24th. I see some force in the analogy you draw between the case of Asir and the other cases but it appears to me that in the Saudi Idrisi Treaty of 1926 the Idrisi accepted a much more complete protectorate over Asir than the control we have established over the Persian Gulf rulers. I purposely use the word ’’control w because we have refused to call it a ’’protectorate” and have insisted that the states of these rulers are ’’independent”* I was not aware that we had oeen increasingly inclined to assert ’’sovereignty” over Kuwait and Bahrain for international purposes. I should have said that the indications were rather to the contrary during the last five years. I need not 9 however* overload this letter with a discussion of so elusive a question. 4. To return to the desert zone. His Majesty’s Government have not yet* I think* decided what are the present limits of the effective rule of the Sheykhs but I take it that they would not in any case be held to extend beyond the proposed ring-fence of the zone on its easterly side. If so* the position would appear to be that, on the re s nullius doctrine* Ibn Saud may possibly have acquired sovereign rights in parts of the potential desert zone but that His Majesty’s Government cannot have done so (a) because they have never themselves performed any act of acquisition there and (b) because their clients exercise no such rights there as might be held to have become our rights for international purposes. 5. Looking at it from a political point of view. I agree generally with paragraph 4 of your letter of January 31st. Unless there should be such economic developments as to make it worth somebody’s while to pacify/pacify the area at all costa, I cannot think that the theoretical difficulties are at all likely to arise in practice in so remote an area in the course of the next twenty years, the longest period for which we have thought of making an agreement. It may be useful to recall that at one phase of the dispute regarding Najran, Ibn Baud himself seemed willing to leave the political status of that region indeterminate. 6. My main preoccupations are at present, however, (a) the insistence of His Majesty^ Government on Ibn Baud’s categorically renouncing all rights beyond an agreed frontier or a ring-fence as the case may be; (b) my own difficulty in answering the question ’'In whose favour?” and (c) ray belief that some account must be taken of the Arab brethren factor, if we are to get any agreed settlement. It was with these preoccupations in mind that I threw out the vert tentative suggestion in paragraph 10 of my telegram No.23 of February 9th. It will be difficult to get Ibn Saud to renounce the rights, which he claims to possess up to the effective boundaries of the coastal rulers; and, in ray opinion, ouite impossible, if the answer to the question at (b) is, ’In favour of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom”. 7. Meanwhile I have your telegram No.33 of February 22nd to work on. I may say that I am all in favour of now easing the pace in regard to this question and trying to get the Kuwait bl ockade out of the way; but without formally connecting them, for the reason given in paragraph 1 of my telegram No.38 of February 21st. The instructions are all I need for the immediate future, except as regards one point, namely that raised in paragraph 2 of my despatch No.28 of January 29th, I do not know that it matters much, as I fear that, even with the chance of oil mentioned in your letter E 541/77/91 of February 6th received yesterday, Ibn Saud/( ^ Saud will not be content with the moderate accession oT territory contemplated in Stage 2 of the programme. All the same, I feel that in discussing a possible frontier on that •J ; ; basis, it would be better not to refer to uncertain geographical features, What, by the way, iu the special importance of Banaiyan? 8, I need not anticipate the later stages in detail, I find myself thinking more and more that, unless we can o btain a solution on the desert zone basis, yours or mine, we shall be driven either to stalemate or to the position, which I considered inevitable last July, of having to recognise that Saudi Arabia is co-terminous with the Sheykhdoms along the best line of hinterland frontiers that we can claim for them.

Although Ibn Saud*s territorial demands are very extensive he is showing many signs of present anxiety to settle outstanding questions generally. It may be advisaole to take advantage of this and expedite further discussion of frontier question rather than adhere to policy laid down in your telegram No .33. For one thing it is desirable to make as much progress as possible before Fuad leaves next month. 2. I gave Fuad yesterday Memorandum confirming offer mentioned in penultimate paragraph of my telegram under reference. Only value of this is to show conservative character of His Majesty^ Government’s approach. It cannot be mut. • I have mentioned oil consideration but I do not think Saudi Government know much about it or attach any ting like as much importance to economic considerations as to extension of influence in desert. 3. mut.

Inducement might be held out that while territories adjoining limits of zones would accrue respectively /- 2 - L i ft# - r respectively to Arab rulers not one would be committed as regards zone itself and there would be time for completion of study of tribal considerations before end of ten years* 4# I suggested zone should be defined as in corres pondence ending with your telegram No*55* If desert zone solution is agreed further limitation proposed in Aden telegram No.19 seems to me unnecessary as Hadramaut tribes would have same access to zone as others* 5. It would be necessary to indicate at very early statje principle* regime proposed for zone. I suggest following (a) All questions of sovereignty to remain in abeyance as between rulers concerned. (b) Rulers to have access to zone to control tribes normally frequenting areas under their sovereignty. (c) Parties concerned in measures in the event of any serious disturbance in zone involving tribes of different allegiance» (d) No flying over except in exercise of right at (b) or to give effect to measures at (c). (e) No economic concessions. 6. I have worded above proposals so as to recognise position of Arab rulers without defining their status or that I believe His Majesty*s Government whose position would be affirmed by terms of agreement being concluded by them. I am not sure whether point (d) above will oe acceptable to His Majesty*s Government but it would probably improve chances of agreement. 7. If Saudi Government should refuse desert zone outright I should propose to offer without further delay area west of green and brown lines on map enclosed in njastem Department’s /rf ‘ 3 - I /S) Departments letter of February 21st as far as intersection with parallel 18 and north of line along that parallel as far as violet line* If this also were refused I should again slow down the negotiations* -RYAN (if °j.Com identl. 1 The lieeidency. &gt;295^3 of x935* Fushire, 12th April x936« Reference Jed da telegram ho *84 to Foreign Office (No *62 to Government of India) dated the 7th ^pril 1936, X enclose copy of a rough office note which I have made, which 7 miy be of some use to you* 7 ^ o y G*K*Caroe squire,C *I*^*, Deputy Secretary (Foreign) to the Gover«iient of India, SimlaA copy of the undermentioned papers is forwarded to the Hon'hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for information Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 318/318/25] No. 1. Sir John Simon to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). (No. 43.) Sir, Foreign Office, January 31, 1935. WITH reference to paragraph 14 of my telegram No. 8 of the 16th January regarding the proposed negotiations for a settlement of the principal questions outstanding between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Government, I now send you the following instructions regarding the question of emergency landing grounds for the Royal Air Force on the Hasa coast and that of the debts owed by the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India. 2. You are already aware from previous correspondence of the desire of the Air Ministry to obtain the landing grounds in question and should not hesitate to avail yourself of any opportunity which may present itself in the course of the negotiations in order to obtain them. At present, however, the Air Ministry are engaged in drawing up a full revised list of their desiderata. It will therefore be unnecessary for you to take any steps in connexion with this matter until you have received this list, which will be sent to you as soon as possible. 3. In regard to the settlement by the Saudi Government of their debts to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, in respect of the supply of arms to King Ibn Saud in 1929 and in respect of the expenses of the Macdonnell Enquiry in 1930, you should consider whether the time has not come to remind the Saudi Government of their plan for repaying these debts, which was mentioned to you by Fuad Bey Hamza on the 21st November, 1933, and which was referred to in the subsequent Saudi note as one which that Government were intending to carry out without the slightest hesitation, had it not been for recent developments in the political situation. While His Majesty’s Government recognise the practical difficulty of obtaining cash payments from King Ibn Saud, it seems to them important to keep the question of these debts alive. If King Ibn Saud is made to understand that His Majesty’s Government attach importance to that question, it may be that, even if early recovery of the debts proves to be impracticable, it will prove possible to secure some concrete concession in return for a further postponement. If, on the other hand, the question is dropped, he may be inclined to attribute less importance to it, and it will in consequence lose any value even as a negotiating counter. 4. I shall be glad if you will report what prospect you see of obtaining any such concrete concession by this means. His Majesty’s Government might be prepared, for example, if there seemed to be little prospect of early repayment of these debts, to consider an arrangement by which a further postponement or an abatement of payment would be granted in consideration for permission to create emergency landing grounds for aircraft on the Hasa coast, or possibly in return for the grant of other Air Ministry desiderata.

They ad^it it in regard to ^tar and Oaudi Arabia, 'n% any rate from the head of the Pohat as-Salwa os far as Sakak*' I understand that they would admit it in alternative (b) above, in the sense that they would regard the boundaries of the desert sone as being also the boundaries of the various rulers. It ©eema to me that if it were fully admitted In alternative (a) «nd admitted also in alternative (e) the position would be healthier fror?i the point of view of the Air Ministry than if there were any intervening ££&amp; nnllius . It might be doubtful whether particular territory belonged to Qatar or Abu jhabi but this presumably need not prevent His Majesty 1 a Government from having an intelligence organisation and fro^i employing aircraft in the area generally east of the lalwa-Banaiyan line, that is to say an area which, except st Salwa itself, would extend well beyond the proposed protection Unit of Qatar. 6 .

My telegram No .66. Question was considered by Middle East Official Sub-Committee on April 15th with following results. 2. When desert zone solution was originally proposed 1 November it was anticipated that far larger area would be subject to special desert regime than that now comtemplat ed. Information since received shows that Southern Frontier of any concession to Ibn Saud whether in full sovereignty or in form of a desert zone should not oe further south than line starting from intersection of parallel 18 and violet line and running roughly east - north east up to and through intersection of parallel 19 and meridian 52 (and if necessary onwards in the same direction - see paragraph 6 below). 1)^1^ h' 3. There is also little question that final concession contemplated in my telegram No.8 i.e. area (south of Banaiyan) up to meridian 52 in full sovereignty will have to be made in the end. This would further reduce proposed desert zone to a trapezoid between meridians 52 and 55. 4. Sub-Committee consider that in these circumstances complicated desert zone regime which might have been suitable /suitable for large area originally in question is too elaborate a solution for this very reduced and inaccessible area. They think that it will be better not to attempt ■* possible difficult task of working out its details and of imposing it on Ibn Saud and to abandon the whole idea desdrt to zones or of special servitudes in this area proceeding^direct offer of further limited concessions in full sovereignty by one or possibly two stages. 5. First and second stage contemplated in my telegram v* ' No.8 i.e. definition of Ibn Baud's claims and offer of our opening concession have now been concluded and next stage will presumably open with Saudi reply to your offer of so- £ called 'green line' (see your telegram No.84 paragraph 6). f If as you anticipate this offer is rejected as entirely insufficient you are now authorised to offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty and without any servitudes further area enclosed by line running from a point on Green Line to South and distance of at least 5 miles from BANIYAN to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 22 degrees 30 thence due south along meridian 52 to its intersection with parallel 19 and thence in a straight line intersecting parallel 18 with Violet Line. This can be referred to as 'Brown Line' concession. 6. If this also proves insufficient, you may as a last resort and if you think there is hope of its leading to agreement, make a further offer in l\ill sovereignty and without servitudes of area bounded by a line running from intersection of parallel 22 degrees 30 and meridian 52 due east to meridian 53 thence due south to intersection of meridian 53 with prolongation in a straight line of sothern boundary of Brown Line concession described in preceding paragraph. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to make /-3 make any concession to Ibn Saud to east of meridian 53. There is no evidence of his having any rights or permanent influence to East of this line greater or as great as that of any other Rulei*s concerned and there are other serious objec tions to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire such rights or influence there* You should not however allow yourself to be drawn into argument on this point and if this third offer fails to satisfy King it will probably be necessary to suspend negotiations. Consequently while appreciating point in paragraph 1 of your telegram No.89 I consider that unless agreement is in sight this concession should only be offered very cautiously. In possible event of negotiations not leading to early result their subsequent resumption would be on basis of position reached at the end of present discussions and if concession to meridian 53 is offered now without result we shall have lost our last concession for the purposes of future bargaining. 7. As you are aware and have yourself advised there are strongest objections to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire access to sea on Eastern side of Qatar Peninsula or to establish a position for King as one of Trucial Coast Rulers. Moreover territory claimed in depression east of Green Line in this region has already been recognised by His Majesty 1 s Government as belonging to Shaikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, His Majesty’s Government having formally recognised rights of latter ( which they have maintained against Turks) in Odeid and also in Aqal (compare India Office memorandum B.430 enclosed in Mr. Rendel’s letter of March 15th, 1934). There can accordingly be no question of any concession to Ibn Saud in this region. You should make j this clear to Saudi Government explaining that you are un able to discuss any further concession east of green line north of Banaiyan* 8 .- 4 - 8. Sub-committee also agreed that in view of legal and practical difficulties likely to arise it will be best not to atteupt to define Saudi frontier in a purely negative sense as against a vacuum in the east ( e*g. by mere recognition by Eis Majesty^ Government that South-East frontiers of Sauci Arabia are so and so) nor to secure purely negative renunciation by Ibn Saud (even if it could be obtained) ol all rights or claims beyond those frontiers on the lines of Article 16 of Treaty of Lausanne* They consider the best course will be to specify the frontier in a single con$)rehensive instrument as being concluded between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, Abu Dhabi Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other (mut) without specifying boundary dividing the four latter territories from each other and to regard full sovereignty of other states concerned as extending right up to boundary line. Shaikh of Qatar and of Abu DhaM and Aden Protectorate will be represented in the negotiations by His Majesty^ Government. Position as regards Muscat is more difficult and has not yet been fully explored but for your confidential information India Office would be prepared if necessary and subject to consent of Government of India to endeavour to obtain from Sultan authority for yourself or other British delegate to represent him. - SHCHET/vRY OF STATE FOR ' FORE I GIT AFFAIRS (Copy forwarded to Bahrain and Muscat under P.L.No.378-S of 4/5/35).

We agree that no harm will bedone if negotiations are postponed for the present. In our opinion the only really important point is to prevent Ibn Saud from encroaching East of Green Line to north of BANAIYAN. If this can be secured by definite agreement which could be enforced against him and his successors there would appear to be no harm in granting him fcrmal concessions further south even beyond ’‘last resort’ 1 line as defined in paragraph 6 of Foreign 3^ Office telegram No.70 of April 2nd. All this area is desert in which no effective sovereignty is exercised by any State and adoption of attitude recommended in paragraph 8 of Foreign Office telegram quoted above is likely to be ombarrassing both to His Majesty's Government and to Trucial Coast States whose interests His Majesty's Government will represent. If primary objective above cannot be obtained further negotiations would appear to be valueless from our point of view since we shall merely be making concessions and obtaining nothing in return. 73^ 3.

You are not unaware that after the expiration of the period of seven years fixed for the validity of the Treaty of Jedda, viz. September 1934, the relations established betwe n the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the United Kingdom in Great Britain in accordance with that Treaty Jiav ® become susceptible of abrogation (and) after one of t ue contracting parties shall have given the other six months notice of his intention to abrogate it. In view o the fact that it would be to the mutual interests which both parties must desire to strengthen and consolidate. the Government of Hi a Majesty the King desire to agree with the Government of the United Kingdom in Great Britain on a new and stable arrangement. Therefore and in accordance with the mutual desire shovm by the two parties on numerous occasions in regard to the prolongation of the effect of the provisions of the Treaty of Jedda for a long period, ray Government wish to take the following steps in this connexion:- (1) with the exception of what is stated in the following paragraphs, Hie Government of H.M. the King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom agree to the extension of the effect of the Treaty of Jedda which was signed on Friday the 18 th bhu'l &lt;*ada 1345 A*i; f (20th May 1927) for a period of ten complete years as from today* s date.

I therefore wish to receive from Your Excellency confirmation of the fact that the Arabic and English texts are of equal validity in sense and in interpretation and that neither of the two texts has preference over the other* I therefore request that Your Excellency would be good enough to inform me whether the Government of the United Kingdom in Great Britain approve of this arrangement^in which case my letter and your reply thereto shall be considered /asas a formal document recording the agreement between the two Governments* with highest respects.

The Shaikh of Qatar claims jurisdiction up to a line joining Salwa and Khor al Odaid. Neither he nor the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi claim jurisdiction south or west of this line or west of a line running south from Khor al Odaid. Even the Manasir who are always credited as bei g a tribe under Abu Dhabi pay their taxes, such as zakat, to Bin Sa T ud T s agent. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has never clai ed that the Manasir are a tribe under his exclusive control. The Manasir are dependent for their livlihood upon pearling and to that extent only does the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi control them. I am cert s in tha t the Shaikh has no Liwa agent. He makes no attempt to ccjllect any form of tax from the Manasir who live in the Dhafrah, iexcept, of course, the usual /monies honourable Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian U ulf, Bushire. a.2 . monies recovered from pearl divers. 4. As regards Banaiyan, Ambak and Sufak. If you refer to Philby T s and Thomas’ most recent maps you will find that these places are not marked on both of them except Banaiyan. On Philby’s map Ambak may be one of three places. Sufak is shown on ^homas 1 map but not on Phiiby’s. In addition so far as I can ascertain the position accepted by us for these olaces on the map does not agree with the Arab positioning of them. Lastly, the whole of the Banaiyan, Sufak, Ambak area is populated v __ by the A1 ^iurra tribe, which is exclusively within Sa’udi Arabia and Y.hich owes its allegiance exclusively to Sa’udi Arabi. 5. What I have said above is I know what the Shaikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi will tell me. I think what is not appre- f 'H ciated about these Shaikhs is that they regard Bin Sa’ud as their natural &amp;ing and the British Government as their protector from paying Bin Sa’ud taxes. They would not, how r ever, dare to question Bin Sa’ud’s authority outside their respective spheres. 6. Therefore, the answers to paragraph 2(a) of the Secretary of State’s telegram is ’’no”; to paragraph 2(b), the A1 ^urra tribe owe their allegiance exclusively to Bin Sa’ud. 7. I think if the Secretary of State wishes to maintain his position as set forth in paragraph 2 of his telegram, the best way to do so would not be to attempt to produce proof him self but leave it to the other side to prove. Therefore, as I will be in a flying boat and as you require your information at once I will signal you the one word ’’verified” if what I have written above is correct.

[E 3944/77/91] f W V QO June 25, 1935. Section 3. L**-' JL lu'P' X - /^O ' k ‘3/- S, * Record of First Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza held at the Foreign Office on June 24, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting:— Mr. Rendel. Sir Andrew Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). _ ( q Mr Mr Ward. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Mr. RE ADEL ^called the discussions which had taken place with Fuad Bey in London in^September 1934 and had been continued in Jedda during the winter. The most important question dealt with during those discussions had been that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The position was that the Saudi Government had communicated a statement of their claims to Sir A. Ryan on the 3rd April, and that Sir A. Ryan, on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, had offered the Saudi Government a strip of territory to the east of the Anglo-Turkish boundary (generally known as the “blue line”), which, as Fuad Bey was aware—although it had been agreed not to stress this aspect of the question for the present—His Majesty’s Government regarded as the present legal boundary. The concession which His Majesty’s Government had now offered was shown on the map of which Mr. Rendel gave Fuad Bey a copy, by a green line, and Fuad Bey would observe that it included the whole of the western shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, the important strategic post of Qasr-as-Salwa, and the Akhwan settlements of Sakak and Mabak (Anbak) at the base of the Qatar Peninsula, whence it ran due south to the Abu Dhabi well of Banaiyan. The Saudi Government had not yet replied to this offer, and Fuad Bey had left Arabia before it could be discussed. It had therefore been agreed that the conversations should be continued in London, and Mr. Rendel suggested that Fuad Bey should begin by giving his views on Sir A. Ryan’s offer. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he had the impression that the frontier line offered by Sir Andrew Ryan was not based upon any relevant material facts. The proposals contained in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April were, on the other hand, based upon the most important factor in the desert, namely, the recognised grazing grounds (“ diras ”) of the various nomadic tribes. He was convinced that it would be impossible to draw the frontier on anything /but a Jribal basis of this kind, and he saw no alternative to the system proposed by the Saudi Government. Mr. RENDEL observed that it would be difficult to base a line on purely tri bal considerations. The greater part of the area concerned consisted of an immense expanse of featureless desert more comparable to a sea than to any ordinary land area. According to the information of His Majesty's Government the various tribes wandered very widely over this area, and it would be impossible to base territorial claims on the extent of these wanderings. Moreover, the information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government was that many of these tribes were of uncertain and shifting allegiance. There were, of course, certain areas which were predominantly or exclusively frequented by certain tribes, owing a definite and exclusive allegiance to a particular ruler. His Majesty’s Government had taken such circumstances into full account in making their proposals. But an arrangement based on tribal considerations alone would certainly prove impracticable. SIR A. RYAN supported Mr. Rendel's view that a simple allocation of tribal areas could not replace a territorial frontier. Every attempt to leaveterritorial frontiers fluid, on the basis of the allocation o noeh only had hit failed e.q., on the Saudi-Iraq frontier, and it had always proved necessar, have a definite frontier establishing formal limits to territorial, as distinct;; personal, sovereignty. Mr. RENDEL continued by explaining that His Majesty’s Govern fully realised, of course, that there was no question of attempting to estac a sharply defined frontier in the ordinary European sense, with frontier y and a close frontier control. It w as, however, necessaiy, as Sir A. Ryan^ explained, to set some definite limit beyond which territorial sovereignty^ not be exercised, even if such territorial sovereignty weie not, in fact, exert;, lip 'to that limit. This would not prevent the tribes wandering freely frou territory to another, and no doubt suitable arrangements could eventual!' made regarding their taxation, &amp;c., as had been done in the case of the b which migrated between Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, Syria, and Iraq. Ant. ments could be made defining the allegiance of various ti ibes 01 sections of triv But whatever was done about this, it seemed clear that a definition of the ultii limits of territorial sovereignty must now be established SIR ANDREW RYAN pointed out that although the line which E Majesty’s Government had now offered the Saudi Government did not huh far to the east of the Anglo-Turkish line, it did definitely take into act; existing facts, even though these facts might be at variance with what Majesty’s Government regarded as the technical legal position, since itcoit: to King Abdul Aziz sovereignty over Qasr-as-Salwa and the Akhwan settle! which King Abdul Aziz had established to the east of the Anglo-Turkish fra His Majesty’s Government were prepared to concede this, and other a; permanently inhabited by Murra tribesmen of Saudi allegiance, but there not possibly concede the whole expanse of desert over which this tribe' accustomed to range at various times of the year. FUAD BEY suggested that in drawing the northern end of the prop:? frontier in the neighbourhood of the Qatar Peninsula, the political allegiai actual settlements and recognised districts should be adopted as a guie principle. He considered that King Abdul Aziz had an unassailable claim to area considerably to the east and north-east of the line proposed by His Majes Government in this sector. As regards the desert area to the south, tku method of drawing the frontier, in his view, would be to take account oh; and grazing areas known to be under the predominant control or ownership certain tribes. He maintained that the majority of such wells and areas Eastern Arabia were definitely recognised as being the property of one part! tribe, although they might also be used by others, and that it would be pos to ascertain their ownership and to make use of this knowledge in defining tribal areas. Mr. RENDEL said that His Majesty's Government had been influent the same considerations, and that it was for this reason that they maintir that the well of Banaiyan must belong to Abu Dhabi. They were satisfied^ information before them that the claim of the sheikh to this well, which] indeed a key-point in his territory, was a sound one; and from what had]' during the very full discussions of this questions which had taken placed] the winter, he saw no hope of His Majesty’s Government modifying their att on this point, although they were willing to discuss further concessions to south of it, wdiere such concessions might be easier to arrange. I LAD BEY made it clear that the Saudi Government could not accep views of His Majesty’s Government about Banaiyan, which, he claimed, be] exclusively to the Murra tribe. He invoked the evidence of Mr. Bertram L on this point, but Mr. RENDEL pointed out that Mr. Bertram Thomas's ev! showed that the allegiance of the tribes in this area was most uncertain further quoted the fact that Mr. Philby had apparently been obliged to tum/j wards in this neighbourhood in the following year, since he had found _ reaching the limits of the area over which King Abdul Aziz exercised e ] sovereignty. On this last point Fuad Bey replied that Mr. Philby h^d 1 ? only been turned back towards the west by his failure to find any water. ; BEY repeated his contention that Banaiyan could not be regarded as bel^Ila &lt;i hitia necessan istincti GoverniJ to estaf. ’ontierp] L -. %ac i ei gnt)-o, ct, exerci % from a | ventualji &lt; the ii 1- Arran )ns of trii the ultim whicli E aot run f into accu h what [; r it contfi' i settlem ;ish front- other ar : t they tf. is tribe i :he propif allegianit s a guit j claim to [is Majest ith. the Hint of i ; iwnerslnf aas in&amp; re partici d be pos . defining nfluencd - maintat tisfiehon [, which'''■ t had f place te heir atW ssions to ot accept red, hefe iranr h tas's evi^ icertait - to turn 1 '] nurd hh' ised efc • had j: ter ^ ; as ^ to Abu Dhabi; but this point was not pursued at this meeting, although it was alluded to from time to time, and it was not until the next meeting on the following day that Fuad Bey developed it further. FUAD BEY then reverted to the question of the northern terminal of the line now proposed by His Majesty's Government, and fried to show that King Abdul Aziz could claim not only Qasr-as-Salwa, but the hills to the north-east of it up to a point some 10 or 15 miles up the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa. He claimed that the frontier should run thence in an easterly direction, and then turn slightly southwards and run to the sea to the north of fchor-al-Odeid. A long discussion followed on the question of this line. As regards the north-western end of it Mr. REX DEL pointed out that the Qatar Peninsula was ajdearly defined geographical feature. It was almost an island, and it was only reasonable that the frontier between it and its neighbours on the mainland should follow the natural geographical division between the mainland and the peninsula itself. It was because of this natural geographical division that His Majesty's Government had been prepared to concede to King Abdul Aziz the whole of the western shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, but this same argument applied in turn with equal force against carrying the frontier up the eastern shore of the bay. If this were done the same anomaly would be created as that which at present existed on its western shore. Hhy Majesty’s Government had in fact offered King Abdul Aziz a most generous concessiph in this area, including the important strategic point of Qasr-as -Salwa. Moreover, the Jebel Naksh and the hills in its neighbourhood were part of the same geographical formation as the Jebel Dukhan, which was indisputably the property of Qatar. The case, therefore, for following the natural geographical frontier ai this point appeared overwhelming. The discussion on this portion of the line was resumed at intervals at various stages of the conversation, and eventually FUAD BEY asked whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to offer a line, which he indicated on the map, running eastwards and south-eastwards from the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, and following for some distance the circumference of a circle with a radius of some 10 or 15 miles from Qasr-as-Salwa. Mr. RENDEL explained that he had no authority to offer any concession on this point. He had had the greatest difficulty in securing general agreement for so large a concession as that which had, in fact, been offered. As luad Bey no doubt knew, His Majesty’s Government were, in fact, committed to the protec tion of Qatar against any major aggression. If His Majesty’s Government were to make any further concession to the north-east of Qasr-as-Salwa, they would so weaken the position of Qatar strategically that they might not be aole effectively to carry out this obligation. Just as Qasr-as-Salwa might be regarded as an important strategic outpost for Saudi Arabia, so the area to the north-east of it was an essential strategic area from the point of view of the safety of Qatar. Indeed, it was much more important for Qatar to retain this area than for Saudi Arabia to hold Qasr-as-Salwa, since Qatar was a very small State with no hinterland, whereas Saudi Arabia covered a vast area, and was therefore in a far stronger position from the point of view of defence. FUAD BEY at a later stage of the meeting stated, in reply to a question by Mr. Ward, that he thought that King Abdul Aziz might be prepared to abandon his claim to the Jebel Naksh, which he described as an outlying spur of the Jebel Dukhan range! _ . . Fuad Bey then raised the question of the Saudi claim to Khor-al-Odeid, which he described as being the most vital poiht'at issue, and to which he mam- fained that King Abdul Aziz possessed an established and irrefutable right. He explained that the Khor-al-Odeid had in the past been well known as a landing place for merchandise for the Hasa coast, and that King Abdul Aziz could not abandon an outlet to the sea which possessed such important possibilities ot commercial development. SIR A. RYAN pointed out that Fuad Bey had told him at Jedda when describing the Saudi claims, that King Abdul Aziz wanted to secure Khor-al- Odeid in order to stop smuggling through it into Saudi territory, and that this seemed rather inconsistent with the contention that it was neeaed for commercial development. [431 bo—3] B 2Mr WARD and Mr. MALCOLM explained that, according to the informa tion in the possession of His Majesty’s Government, the khor-al-Odeid was,&gt; fact, extremely shallow and practically useless as a harbour, ruad Bey did not, however, pursue this point. Mr. RENDEL explained to Fuad Bey that he saw no prospect of His Majesty’s Government being able to modify their attitude on this pait of the line, In the first place, they were committed to the recognition of the Sheikh of Abu DEabi’sjclaim to the whole of the Khor-al-Odeid, having told the Sheikh of Abb Dhabi, to whom they were bound by treaty, that they regarded his territory as extending round the Khor and up to the north-eastern point of the mouth of tbe Khor. They could not give awav the sheikh’s territory. His Majesty’s Govern ment could not violate or disregard their obligations to these Trucial rulers, even l when these obligations involved them in difficulties with othei Dovveis. The same i situation had arisen in regard to certain islands belonging to the Jowasimi Arab rulers which were claimed by Persia, where His Majesty’s Government had been obliged firmly to resist the Persian claims. For the same reason His Majesty’s Government could not admit any Saudi claim to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's territory round the Khor-al-Odeid. But apart from this, as Fuad Bey was aware, His Majesty’s Government had long had a very strong interest in the whole stretch of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf from Qatar to Muscat. The Sheikhdoms of Qatar, Abu Dhabi, fc formed a chain of States with which His Majesty’s Government had had spedal relations for a very long period, ever since the days when they had been obliged to assume a certain measure of control in this area in order to stop piracy, gun- running and the slave trade. The maintenance of this measure of British control was an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf. It had made it necessary for His Majesty’s Government firmly to resist any attempts by any other Power to establish itself on the Trucial Coast, and it would be at complete variance with this policy for His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce in any powerful State, such as Saudi Arabia, acquiring a new outlet to the sea on this coast. Moreover, it was a principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Government on the Trucial Coast that the chain of these Arab sheikhdoms should be unbroken His Majesty’s Government had recognised the Sheikhdoms of Qatar and Abu Dhabi as being coterminous. They could not now agree to their being separated by a wedge of Saudi territory. SIR ANDREW RYAN supported Mr. Rendel’s argument and pointed out that if King Abdul Aziz were to obtain an outlet to the sea at the Khor-al-Odeid. Qatar would become entirely dependent on Saudi Arabia, which would become its only neighbour, the effect of this would be to reduce the sheikhdom in fad. if not in theory, to the position of a dependency of King Abdul Aziz. This elicited from FI AD BEY a remark to the effect that he had scenic a British handbook on Arabia, issued at the time of the Paris Peace Conference, a statement to the effect that Qatar belonged to King Abdul Aziz. It was pointed out in reply that the Foreign Office were familiar with this statement, which wat I no more accurate or authoritative than many other slips which had crept into sucli hurriedly prepared works of reference, and only been discovered subsequently. . Pjiad^Bey eventually admitted that he realised the objections from tk point of v rew of His Majesty s Government to recognisino 1 the Saudi claim to tk SK~^“9 ( * ei( Y n °G however, specifically abandon the Saudi claim, and took tne line that the discussion had shown the existence of a complete deadlock m regard to the northern end of the line. Mr. RENDEL repeated that he saw no hope of His Majesty’s Governme?| itvinp* rhpir oVvrvnf ic^ i j .i ■■ -»-v c • i.V»micrndid not in fact possess any internationally recognised rights to the east of it The United States oil companies had been informed of this, and had not questioned the position. If the piesent proposals of His Majesty’s Government were ctcceptcd, King Abdul Aziz would obtain el vjilid, undisputed cind pernicinent frontier, which would be a great advantage not only to him, but also—what was perhaps of even more importance—to his successors. Would it not then be wise to accept the piesent offei of a sound and permanent frontier, rather than perpetuate a situation which must inevitably be unstable and might lead to serious difficulty eventually? The frontier which His Majesty’s Government had proposed was geographically sound and corresponded to'the facts of the situation as they had been ascertained as the result of long and careful enquiry. He bego-ed Fuad Bey to consider the question afresh on this basis. FUAD BEY gave no indication that King Abdul Aziz would be prepared to modify his attitude. If Mr. Rendel’s instructions were rigid, so were his own. It was eventually agreed, however, that Fuad Bey and the Saudi Minister should study the maps and material communicated to them and seek instructions from their Government. On the receipt of these instructions, the question would be considered how far the discussions could be further usefully pursued. Foreign Office, June 25, 1935.EASTERN (Arabia). June 25, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. L 1+ V'T-w fE 3946/77/91] Record of the First Part of the Second Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza held on June 25, 1935, at 11-50 a.m. THE following were present:— Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Mr. RENDEL opened the conversation by informing Fuad Bey that in order to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government were not adopting a purely negative attitude, he wished at once to state that they were ready to offer King Abdul Aziz a further concession of territory to the south and east of Banaiyan in addition to the “green line” offer which had been made by Sir Andrew Ryan in April last and had formed the subject of discussion at the meeting on the 24:th June. This further concession was the area bounded on the north, east, and south by what was shown on the map, which he then hancled to Fuad Bey, as a brown line, and might therefore be known in future as the “ brown line concession ”—a line, that is, running from a point on the “ green line ” to the south of, and distant at least 5 miles from, Banaiyan, to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 20° 30' N.; thence due south along meridian 52° E. to its intersection with parallel 19° N. and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° N. with the “violet line ” of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. Fuad Bey was given a map on which the two concessions were marked. FUAD BEY HAMZA, in reply, said that as a result of the first day’s conversa tions he had re-examined the information in his possession regarding the proper attribution of Banaiyan, which His Majesty’s Government had claimed on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. He was now satisfied in his own mind not merely that the well of Banaiyan belonged to the Murra tribe, but that sheikhs of this tribe, who were definitely in the service of King Abdul Aziz, controlled a string of wells (which Fuad Bey named) running eastward from Banaiyan as far as Safq (Sufuk). Mr. RENDEL suggested that it would be of assistance to His Majesty’s Government in considering these claims if Fuad Bey could provide a memorandum stating the Saudi view of the position in detail and giving the fullest possible evidence in support of it. FUAD BEY agreed to do so. It was then agreed to proceed to the discussion of various secondary questions, the first of which was the possible acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of certain minor air facilities on the Hasa coast of Saudi Arabia. This part of the conversation is recorded separately. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Fuad Bey Hamza. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. June 25, 1935. [431 bb—1]1 SECRET . D.O.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). July 3, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4126/77/91] Record of First Part of Third Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 2, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting:— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi-Arabian Minister in London). Mr. RENDEL recalled that, at the two previous meetings at the Foreign Office, discussions about the south-eastern frontiers had been confined to the northern portion of the proposed boundary. It would not be possible to proceed fafth negotiations on this part of the line until each side had had time to consider the arguments put forward by the other. He would like to make it clear, however, that His Majesty’s Government could not modify their attitude in regard to the claims of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in regard to the part of the line at the base of the Qatar Peninsula or in the region of the Khor-al-Odeid. They would, however, give careful consideration to the memorandum which Fuad Bey had promised on the question of the proper attribution of Banaiyan and its district. ic FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he preferred to postpone further detailed discussion of the northern portion of the boundary until His Majesty’s Govern ment had studied his memorandum, which he hoped to have ready very shortly. Speaking about the south-eastern frontier problem as a whole, he could hold out little hope that King Abdul Aziz would be able to accept the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, since the boundary they had suggested, unlike that proposed in the memorandum communicated by Fuad Bey to Sir A. Ryan on the 3rd April, 1935, was not based upon the existing situation in the desert. King Abdul Aziz would no doubt be ready to give way on specific points if the facts could be shown to be otherwise than he claimed, but he could not break his pledges to those tribes who had placed themselves under his protection. Fuad Bey hoped that His Majesty’s Government would appreciate the difficulties which confronted the King—particularly in view of his position vis-a-vis Arab national sentiment—when asked to surrender territory to which he had an established claim. Mr. RENDEL explained that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the position of King Abdul Aziz. But he could not accept Fuad Bey’s contention that the proposals of His Majesty’s Government were not based on the existing situation. The line they were offering was based upon facts ascertained after the most careful enquiry. Fie then suggested that the meeting should proceed to discuss^ the southern sector of the line. Since the discussions with Fuad Bey Hamza in London in September 1934, much detailed information had been obtained in regard to the allegiance and distribution of tribes in this area, and the southern sector of the line which His Majesty’s Government were now offering (running from the inter section of the Anglo-Turkish “violet” line of 1914, and parallel 18° N. to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 19° N.) had been drawn up in conformity with this information so as to include within^ the Aden Protectorate the territory predominantly inhabited by the Hadhrami tribes of the Protectorate. It was true that the proposed frontier was a straight and artificial line; but this was inevitable in the case of a line running through a featureless and practically uninhabited desert, and need present no difficulties, since both parties were try ing I to fix the ultimate limits of territorial sovereignty and not to establish a frontier in the European sense of the word. 8025 [11839—1]FUAD BEY remarked that the drawing of the boundary in this secto depend upon what tribes His Majesty’s Government claimed^for the Hal!' He was understood to say that there were three important tribes in th between the central desert and the Hadhramaut Valley—.the Seiar Karl! Jinaba—and that great authority was wielded in this region by a certaini who was in correspondence with all the neighbouring Governments—w? King of the Yemen, with the Saudi Government, and, Fuad Bey supposed the authorities in the Aden Protectorate. Fuad Bey explained that Kina v Aziz did not claim the allegiance of the Seiar and the Karab, althouoh thVh of the Yemen might do so, but, even so, he considered that the line propod His Majesty’s Government was placed much further north than could ^ be justified by the facts. Returning to the general question of the fronts a whole, he enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would agree toa^ being prepared to illustrate the habitats of the tribes in the desert, and to n as a basis for the allocation of territory? Fuad Bey adverted to the ar% ; he had produced at the first meeting on the 24th June, namely, that the lb the tribes were fixed and could be definitely ascertained by experts, Mr. RENDEL pointed out that there was a wide differencUbet extreme limits within which a tribe might wander (and which would inevip overlap with the limits of other tribes) and the actual territory within w’h; tribe was predominant. His Majesty’s Government had always been reat recognise as belonging to a tribe territory in which it was unquestionably, predominant influence, but it seemed obvious that there would have to\ compromise as between the extreme limits of the various tribal diras. SIR ANDREW RYAN brought the discussion back to the southerns of the frontier. He pointed out that in the south-east and south the line prop by King Abdul Aziz himself (in the memorandum communicated by Fuad:- on the 3rd April, 1935) was itself artificial, inasmuch as it was a straight defined by geographical co-ordinates. On the other hand, Fuad Bey hadtoldl that the King only claimed three tribes (the Murra, Beni Hajir and Dir [Dimnau]) and part of another (the Manasir) in the Ruba-al-Khali. Iff Bey wished the allocation of territory to take place on the basis of dira; suggested that it would be useful if he could produce a map showing thedk these three and a half tribes to serve as a working basis for the discussions was remarkable that a claim to less than four tribes could be held to justify dr (as made in Fuad Bey’s memorandum of the 3rd April) covering an enom portion of South-Eastern Arabia. FUAD BEY enquired the reasons which led His Majesty’s Governm© propose a southern boundary sloping north-east from the intersection'* V1( n e *i -.nJ 16 aiK ^ P ara ^ e l 18- Why was the line not carried due eastward parallel 18 ? Mr. RENDEL explained that the line followed the direction of the an o e natural features of the country, which all ran towards the nod un is part of Arabia. It was obviously necessarv that there should l eri&gt; itory between the boundary with Saudi Arabia ai nf tt 6 ■ a .{ lramau L since it was known that the territory in the po$$ nn back a considerable distance beyond the stepped ment wprf ° f f rt into the san ds themselves.'

The case hardly seemed one in which an international commission could accomplish useful Vork in the Ruba-al-Khali, where the population was sparse, wild and nomadic, and where it would hardly be piacticable to interrogate tribal leaders; moreover, before the tribal situation was accepted as a basis it would be necessary to decide the exact attribution of all the tiibes m (question. I here were, too, other considera- tions besides that of tribal diras. Fuad Bey had virtually admitted this by defending the Saudi claim to the Khor-al-Odeid at the first meeting on the ground of its commercial importance to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rendel and feir Andrew liyan went on to express the view that the next stage in the negotia tions should be the production by Fuad Bey (for consideration by His Majesty’s Government) of the fullest possible information in support of his arguments against the southern sector of the line proposed by His Majesty’s Government, and of his contention that the line proposed in his memorandum of the 3rd April (a line running on the south from the intersection of meridian 56° E. and parallel 22 c N. to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 17° N., thence due west along parallel 17 until its intersection with the Anglo-Turkish “ violet ” line) offered the fairest and most suitable boundary. It would be most convenient if this information were to be supported by a map showing the limits of the diras of the specific tribes claimed by the Saudi Government. FUAD BE\ replied that he could supply this information, if necessary, though it would take a long time, as it could only be obtained in Arabia. For his part he preferred the alternative course, namely, that His Majesty’s Government should produce a detailed statement of their criticisms of the line which King Abdul Aziz had proposed. This line had been evolved in accordance with the request made by His Majesty’s Government in the preceding autumn for a statement of the King’s claims. Much trouble had been taken to collect evidence and to explore the tribal position, and he was convinced that the line was both accurate and fair. King Abdul Aziz had not hesitated to make sacrifices on his side where the facts did not warrant his maintaining his claims, and Fuad Bey cited as an instance the abandonment of the Saudi claim to the Manahll, Ahl Kathir and Muhara [Mahra] sub-tribes (branches of the Da'akeih tribe) although when he had written is book about Arabia a couple of years ago he had claimed them for Saudi Arabia. But no sooner had King Abdul Aziz complied with the request of His Majesty’s Government and put forward a statement of his claims, than His Majesty’s Government, without even replying to this or stating their objections to it, had put forward an alternative, and quite inadequate, counter-proposal of their own. This suggested that they had never intended to take King Abdul Aziz’s proposals seriously, and were merely trying to strike a bargain, instead of getting at the facts. It seemed to him only just and reasonable that His Majesty’s Government should now give their views on the line proposed by King Abdul Aziz, instead of pressing their own counter suggestion and inviting him to offer his criticisms on it. Mr. RENDEL regretted that he could not share Fuad Bey’s opinion as to the next stage. It had been agreed that while negotiations were in progress no emphasis would be laid on the fact that His Majesty’s Government regarded the Anglo-Turkish Blue and Violet lines as defining the strict legal position in regard to the frontier; but he felt bound to point out that the Anglo-Turkish lines did, in fact, form the starting-point for the negotiations. His Majesty’s Government had, however, made the most thorough enquiry as to the existing facts, and, as a result, they were now offering important concessions in derogation of the strict legal position; if the Saudi Government were not satisfied it seemed clear, therefore, that it was for them to give their reasons. It was not a question of criticising the proposals as a whole. The line could be divided into various sectors. The sector from the Dohat-as-Salwa to BahaTyan had formed the subject of very full discussion at the first meeting, and Mr. Rendel had explained in detail the reasons for which His Majesty’s Government could not accept the claims of King Abdul Aziz in this sector. As regards the corner of the line at Banaiyan, he had already undertaken that Fuad Bey^ promised memorandum should be carefully studied. They were now discussing the southern part of the frontier, and as Fuad Bey wa^demurring to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government in this sector of the line as well, it was surely for him to give his reasons andelaborate his views. Apart from these considerations Mr. Rendel felt thattv claims put forward in the Saudi memorandum of last April were so extensive 0 the south and south-east, and included so vast an area which was manifesti-; outside the dominions of King Abdul Aziz, that little would be gained criticising it in detail. He could say at once that His Majesty’s Govermnenl would never be able to agree to concessions on so immense a scale involving cession of territory belonging to rulers to whom they were bound by ancient treaties. Moreover, the Saudi claims in the south and the south-east were mereli ’defined in the memorandum, and were not supported by any detailed informatiot such as would be essential if they were to be subjected to detailed criticism Another point was that the tribes claimed by King Abdul Aziz in the Ruba-ai Khali were (on Fuad Bey’s own statement to Sir A. Ryan) only three and partoi a fourth in number, whereas the tribes of the Hadhramaut were very numerous It would therefore be much simpler for the Saudi Government to state the limits which they claimed for the diras of their three and a half tribes than for His Majesty’s Government to produce a detailed exposition of the rights of the trite of the Aden Protectorate and of the other rulers concerned. SIR ANDREW RYAN then joined Mr. RENDEL in urging Fuad Bey to accept the line which His Majesty’s Government had now offered—i.e., fromtk intersection of the “ violet ” line of 1914 and parallel 18 to the intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 19—as a basis of negotiation, and to obtain and supplt a detailed statement of the views of the Saudi Government upon it. FUAD BEY insisted that the line proposed by the Saudi Government ii fact followed as closely as possible the limits of the diras of the tribes he k mentioned to Sir A. Ryan in April as owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. Ht suggested that it was unreasonable to ask for a further statement regarding them and repeated that King Abdul Aziz would not be able to give way on any part of the line he claimed. But, after a long further discussion, he eventually agree; to meet the request of the Foreign Office representatives and to supply a further statement of the views of his Government on the southern sector of the proposed boundary. The meeting then proceeded to discuss the future of the Treaty of Jedda This part of the discussion is recorded separately.

[E 3946/77/91] Mr. Rendel to Fuad Bey Hamza. My dear Fuad Bey, Foreign Office, June 27, 1935. YOU will remember that on the morning of the 25th June, during our conversation on the subject of the south-eastern frontiers, you promised to let me have a memorandum setting out in detail the precise reasons for which your Government regarded the wells from Banaiyan to Sufuk in the hinterland of Abu Dhabi as belonging to a section of the Murra tribe, which owed exclusive allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. As I explained in the course of our conversation, His Majesty’s Government, on the information at present in their possession, regard the well of Banaiyan as belonging to the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. I will, however, gladly submit to my Secretary of State any arguments on this point which you may care to bring forward, though you will understand that I cannot give you any indication whether these arguments will lead His Majesty’s Government to modify the attitude which they have adopted, as I explained it to you in the course of our discussions. I will await the receipt of your memorandum before pursuing this question further. Yours very sincerely, G. W. RENDEL. [431 dd—1]THIS DOCUM ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE STY’S GOVERNMENT [ EASTERN (Arabia). July 3, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4111/77 91 ! Fuad Bey Saudi Arabian Legation, London, Dear Mr. Rendel, July 2, 1935. I AM very sorry that I was unable to prepare the note I promised you in the course of our conversation on the 25th June on the subject of the line of frontiers in Eastern and Southern Arabia before receiving your letter dated the 27th June. This delay was caused by unavoidable reasons of which you are no doubt aware. 2. I would like to explain most emphatically and sincerely that the line of frontiers given in the note which I had the pleasure to present to Sir Andrew Ryan in Jedda on the 3rd April, 1935 (29th Thil Hijja, 1353), was defined after the most careful investigation into the actual situation at the present moment and after the following important factors have been taken into consideration :— / ^ ffty CjU amza to Mr. Rendel.—(Received July 3.) Section 3. (X • ft// i /£. c/W? f (1) The fact that both Governments (the British and the Saudi Arabian) have agreed to put aside the legal question so long as it was possible to reach an honourable agreement, as it was preferable to try to draw a new line for the frontiers which would be acceptable to all parties concerned and which would safeguard the permanent common interests. (2) The fact that the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz did not adopt the wide principle which was the basis of her relations with the tribes of the desert which had declared their allegiance and submission to His Majesty the King as the tribes of Da-akeih, \\z. r A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra—and most of the tribes of A1 Manasir, A1 Dam’, A1 ’Awamir, Beni Ghafir and others, but were content to mention the natural boundaries which were at the same time generally recognised by the tribes inhabitating the desert as belonging to the tribes on whose members and lands His Majesty s Government has exercised direct influence for a long period, during which their ordinary members and their sheikhs were actually in His Majesty s service and His Majesty’s regular army. (3) His Majesty’s Government’s realisation of the extreme difficulties which may arise as a result of an unjust delineation of the frontiers and particularly the great resentment which the tribes may feel if they were abandoned after having rendered loyal allegiance and submission all these long years and after having built their hopes for the iiituie on the continuity of the system of government devised for them and His Majesty’s Government’s wish to keep its promise and fulfil its obligations and responsibility towards its subjects and its neighbours. 3. Having outlined to you these fundamental points I would like to point out that the line of the frontiers which I presented to Sir Andrew Ryan does not contain any exaggeration nor does it leave any room for bargaining oi discussion. As I have pointed out above, due note was taken in delineating t is line, of the tribal considerations which are generally admitted by the Bedouin population and more especially by those of them who are neutral and are theietore not interested in proving somebody s claim or refuting it. 4. You will no doubt remember what I told you m our last two meetings, that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciating the position delegated to me the task of checking the official data concerning the frontiers by taking the evidence of certain neutral persons among the experts of the ese ^ • s a re s u I became convinced that the line referred to above does not exceed the true state of affairs and that the wells of Banaiyan, Sufuq. Battha and Bataihm belong lo the Ahl Murra. . . _ 5. I would like to explain to you now certain details concerning the places and wells belono-ino- to the tribes which would make it easier to understand. o O ^ si(1) A1 Aqal wells, i.e., Aqal-an-Nakhla, Aqal-ar-Kimtli, &amp;c., are conunoui used by Murra and Qatar tribes. (2) Duwaihin belongs to the Manasir tribe. ^ (3) Mijan and Sabakha Matti are shared in common by both the Murra an the Manasir tribes. (4) Banaiyan, Sufuq, Khashm, Turfa, Battha, and Bataihin are well belonging exclusively to the Murra tribe. (5) Arada is the first place belonging to the Manasir in the west between Banaiyan and Qufak-al-Liwa. (6) Bainuna is. a well belonging to the Manasir tribe, but other Bedouin tribes use it. 6. I hope that these details may be of interest to you and may ultimate!? help you to form a general idea about the frontier line, which will, in the end lead to a satisfactory settlement of the issue.

Your obedient Servant# Under Seeretavy of State# India Office.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT The first subject to be discussed was the question of the eastern and south eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. Mr. RENDEL said that no further progress appeared for the moment to be possible, and that it was now for each side to consider the arguments put forward by the other. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, would await the statement which Fuad Bey had promised at the last meeting regarding the dir as or tribal areas of the three and a half tribes claimed by King Abdul Aziz, with particular reference to the southern sector of the boundary proposed bv His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel said that it would be particularly useful it Fuad Bey could accompany this statement with a map which could show loughl) (in, say, gradations of shading or colour) the areas claimed as exclude \, predominantly or only partially inhabited, or wandered over, by paiticulai tribes. FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he would have difficulty in^meeting this latter request, but that he hoped shortly to have ready a list of ovei 150 names of wells, water-holes, &amp;c., showing to which tribes and sections 01 sub-sections o tribes they were regarded as belonging. Mr. RENDEL expressed the hope that the statement might be available as soon as possible; but he explained that it would, of course, have to be lefene to the British authorities in the Gulf and at Aden, so that it might be so mejyeeks before His Majesty’s Government could reply to it.

[E 4127/318/25] Record of Second Part of Third Meetinej with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 2, 1935. THE first part of this meeting was devoted to further discussion of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and is recorded separately. The following were present for the second part of the meeting:— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi-Arabian Minister in London). At the end of the discussion on the frontier question, Mr. RENDEL enquired whether Fuad Bey Hamza desired to raise any particular questions for discussion at future meetings. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he was anxious to discuss the question of the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda. He thought that the opportunity should be taken to revise the treaty at the same time; for instance, the description of King Abdul Aziz in it as “ His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies ” required amendment. Mr. RENDEL explained that Fuad Bey need have no fear that the change in the title of King Abdul Aziz or of the Saudi Kingdom would affect the validity or authority of the treaty : there were numerous cases where the King of England was described by an obsolete title in treaties which were still binding on the United Kingdom. Turning to the question of the prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, Mr. Rendel pointed out that under article 8 it would continue in force indefinitely, unless and until denounced by either party. He felt sure that neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Saudi Government would wish to terminate the treaty, which constituted the basis of their present friendly relations with each other, unless there were some better and more up-to-date instrument to put in its place. There would therefore be no particular advantage in formally prolonging it— i.e., in the two parties binding themselves not to denounce it (since neither had any intention of doing so)—unless it were for the purpose of taking the opportunity to modify or abrogate some provision of the existing settlement. He understood that the main desire of the Saudi Government in making then present proposal was to secure the renunciation by His Majesty s Government of their qualified right to manumit slaves, as set out in the relevant exchange of notes effected at the time of the signature of the main treaty. FUAD BEY did not dissent from this analysis of the position. SIR ANDREW RYAN remarked that there were three possibilities (a) The present treaty could be allowed to go on until the outstanding points at issue had been settled. (b) The present treaty could be formally prolonged, the opportunity being taken to make any necessary changes in its provisions. (c) Negotiations could be begun for a new treaty. He considered that if the second course was to be discussed it would be best to begin by trying to reach agreement on the question of slavery and the i ig o manumission. Mr. RENDEL observed that it was clearly to the common interest of both the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia to maintain their relations upon a farm and durable basis, and it was only a question of the method by which this should 8025—1 [11839—2]be effected. He doubted whether much would be gained by arranging f ort L specific prolongation of the treaty until the main questions at issue had C amicably settled, when, no doubt, a new treaty covering all the ground air closer harmony with the existing position could be negotiated. But if the pr^ treaty were to be formally prolonged and the right of manumission abandoned part of the arrangement, it would be necessary in first place, as Sir A. Ryanh pointed out, to reach a clear understanding on the question of slavery. He pointed out that the abandonment of the right of manumission was a vp delicate matter on account of the keen interest taken in the question of slave ! by large sections of public opinion in Great Britain. His Majesty’s Governnr had, however, undertaken in the relevant exchange of notes to consider ^ surrender of this right if certain conditions were fulfilled; and if they couj ^ show that those conditions were now fulfilled and that a real improvement h ^ been brought about in the general lot of slaves in Arabia, they would be Ie position to justify their action before public opinion. Until this state of affair! came into being, there could be no question of His Majesty's Government agreen ^ to surrender the right of manumission. The present position was that Fuad Bey had communicated privately t Sir A. Ryan certain draft Saudi regulations designed to prevent trade in slavt ! and to ameliorate the condition of existing slaves. These regulations wonlc' require to be completed and strengthened in certain particulars before they coi I be regarded by His Majesty’s Government as justifying the proposed concessiot 1 and he suggested that it would be most useful if Fuad Bey and Sir A. Ryan conic: now discuss the draft regulations together in detail, with a view to the Sant Government making definite proposals on the subject. FUAD BEY agreed to this course and a meeting was accordingly arrange:! between him and Sir A. Ryan for the morning of the 3rd July. Foreign Office, July 3, 1935.p,Z* 4959/1935, 79100/35.

A copy of that letter was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No.4111/77/91 of the 12th July. 2. Mr. Macdonald feels that a fuller explanation of the Saudi Arabian claim then appears in Fuad Bey Hamza’s letter of the 2nd July is required before the matter can be adequately considered. 3. It is, however, understood from Fuad Bey Hamza’s letter that while Kinfe Ibn Saud does not claim the allegiance of certain tribes which form part of the Aden Protectorate, he is not prepared to abandon his claim to the frontier described in the memorandum which was handed by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir Andrew Hyan on the 3rd April last. In this connection attention is invited to the telegram of the ?\ 29th March from the Resident at Aden, a copy of which was enclosed in this Department’s letter of the 4th April, in which he suggested that the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Aden Protectorate should be a straight line drawn from the intersection of parallel 18 with the “violet line' to the intersection of parallel 20 with meridan 55. Without further consultation with the authorities in Aden the Secretary • Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.w.l.of State could not agree to any further concession being offered to Ibn Saud in this section of the frontier. 4 . I am to request that any reply to the letter from the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs may take account of the considerations advanced in the preceding paragraph. 5.

Sir, a I nave the honour to refer to your telegram No:£99 dated the 13th August 1335. xlA V. Before answering the specific questions' contained therein or offering my views on telegram No:2433 dated the 7th August 1^35 from the Secretary of State for India and now to meet its requirements, I feel it incumbent upon me to state more clearly the trend of conversations with the Shaikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi curing my visit to them in July 1935. 3. The Shaikh of Qatar made it clear to me that he would not dare of his own accord to lay claim to any territory south of the boundary Dohat Salwa - Khor al Oaaid during the life time of Bin Sa T ud. He was fully aware of the mineral possibilities of the northern sector of the Buba ai Khali and gave me to understand that when Bin Sa T ud died he had every intention of including it within his dominions. A ’or that reason he was particularly anxious tnat there should be no negotiations nor fixation of boundaries as once His Majesty f s Government had agreed to and defined boundaries2 . 6 V&gt; : nib scxieme of annexation must fail. In tiie meantime tie considerea tnat any endeavour to establish a claim to a sphere of influence in these parts by His Majesty T s Government must ,iGt only iaii but prevent His Majesty T s Government for ail time from establishing such claim, since none of the tribes frequenting tue wells east of the Blue Line mentioned in iuaa Bey namza■ s note of the 3th July 1935 would admit a British sphere of influence or control. Although these trioes (of whom tne Al Murra predominate and are indigenous there; are highly independent ana pay taxes to Bin Sa T ud only o}' reason of iorce ma]eure yet if it came to a question of loyalties they would to a man De on Bin Sa f ud T s side, and resent any form of interference or control by His Majesty T s ( Government. On the other hand were Bin Sa T ud to aie there v/ould be a tribal upheaval ana his successor would have to establish by his own prowess the control, which at present is Bin Sa ? ud T s’fortune. The Shaikh did not think there waAny body in Arabia capable of this. He considered t„at Shaixhs would parcel out Arabia where tney could-* For this reason the Shaikh of A&amp;tar is merely waiting to take his share mentioned above, and which then because of his Treaty right^with His Majesty’s Government coula be brought within the British sphere of influence. 4. As regards the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. He regaraed Bin Sa’ud from a Pan-Arab point of view, snd rather by inference than from what he actually saia I couldjout conclude that his loyalty, after that of loyalty to himself, was|to Bin Sa’ud only. His only value for His Majesty’s Government was that the British reserved for him from Bin Sa’ud’s clutches income from taxes which otherwise would be paid to Bin Sa’ud. /He/VT r~eA- r 3. /Y He refused to claim authority or rigi^t to collect taxes (except from pearl divingj from tjfe Llanasir. He stated clearly to me tuat the Manasir w^re exclusively subjec t to ^Bin Sa T ua. he hau not the lea^'t desire (rather the opposite) to claim jurisdiction over ai$ of the well^mentioned in Fuad iy»s Note ofjthe 8tn July 1935 except at Sufuk*bn the borders of the Sabakhah uatti. Finally, and in despair, I asked the uiiaii^.i if oil p r as iound east of the Blue Line would it be 1 •3a T ud T s. Be looker so astonished that such an iaea had obviously never crosseejhis mind. He replied, how ever, that he would not contest any claim by Bin Sa T ud to it. 5. Incidental to tne above I have talked in a general manner with Shaikh Sir Hamad bin T Isa ^.1 Khalifah about tiiis matter. He knows this part of Arabia ana its tribebjwell. I t gatuered from him tnat all tne wells and places mentioned r I in Fuad Bey T s Bote are exclusively in Sa r udi A rabia and the allegiance of tne tribes using these wells, of which the Al Hurra is the principal, is exclusive to Bin Sa^uu. 3. In my opinion, therefore, it is guite impossible at present to establish any claim to a British sphere of influence in the area east of the Blue Line anclest of the boundaries at present accepted by the Shaikhs of Qatar and n.bu Dhabi as tne limits of their territories chid jurisdictions, for the obvious reasons tuat the Shaikh of Qatar fears Lin Sa T ud andtue Shaiiii of A bu Dhabi regirds him as the Arab ana hence his King. Neituer will question hi^clai,., to the ./ells mentioned in Fuad Le/ ? s Note of tne 8tu July 1935. AW 7.

I reassurca him. The Shaikh continued that boundaries ox ^ata, were well-known and ran from ’AL liASHIBIYAH' near Salwah to Khaur al ’Udaid.

Letter consists of formal sealed letter of greetings and unsealed postcript. It appears possible from style of language of postcript that it may have been dictated by King himself. Following is gist and extracts of important passages begins: (i) Bin Sa’ud writes that there is an important matter in which Shaikh should assist him. Shaikh knows that British have interfered in affairs of 'Oman and Qatar iniwo ways. (ii) Firstly, Bin Sa’ud had informed British that 'Oman and Qatar were his subjects and subjects of his fore fathers (compare ancestral claims correspondence Fowle's letter No.594-S of June 28th 1934). But as people oi tnose countries were looked after by the British and chose to be m their present state and as the British were his friends he had not pressed that view 'so we left the question of the towns only, but no one (i.e. no Trucial Chief) has any right to claim anything or property in the desert or among tne tribes nor had anyone's father or grandfather claimed such a right'. Bin Sa'ud does not wish to deny to anyone an^ thing for which he is responsible or which he can protect but 'things which are beyond his control and in ^ch he no interests, we cannot allow them to pass to any otner person'.I w - 2 - 1^ (iii) Secondly, British claini to have had a treaty with the Turks aixi the Turks allowed them some lands. Bin Sa*ud had k informed British (a) that Turks did not exercise authority or control in those lands nor did they keep order only after he had occupied Hasa and (c) that it was not ratified has heard that an oil company have applied to Shaikh for concession. Once the boundary is fixed Shaikh will be at liberty to do what he likes. Bin Sa'ud requests Shaikh to settled or to ask British either (a) to let him and Shaikh settle boundary without their mediation or (b) to settle boundary with him (Bin Sa*ud) themselves. 'I have explained this to you our brother in order that you may be aware that if the Company starts any work or drilling before the boundaries are settled, we will be compelled to protest and to stop operations and forbid anything being done until thematters between us and them are settled'. (v) In two places therms reference to understanding between him and Shaikh apparently over boundary, but Shaikh denies having committed himself. 2. Shaikh states that he replied that anything to do with Turkish treaty was matter lor British that ^atai boundaries are we 11 -known and that he has already grant in Easa or its vicinity (b) that alleged treaty was signed so thathe does not recognise it. (iv) The object and urgency of his letter are that he postpone matter till boundary between him and British is concession and cannot go back on it 3. Comment follows.

[E 4486/318/25] - -c. - - —-C Record of Sixth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at July 18, 1935. the Foreign Office on present at the meeting :— Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). This was the final meeting of the series, and the opportunity was taken to review the position reached as a result of the earlier conversations, and to decide on the procedure to be followed in future negotiations. I. Mr. RENDEL opened the meeting by recalling the present position in the negotiations about the frontiers of the Saudi Kingdom in Eastern and South- Eastern Arabia. His Majesty’s Government were now in possession of the detailed information supplied by Fuad Bey in his letter of the 2nd July, and his memorandum of the 8th July in support of the boundary claimed by King Abdul Aziz. This information had been passed on to the British authorities in the Persian Gulf and in the Aden Protectorate, who would now devote themselves to a thorough examination of the Saudi case. The eventual conclusions of His Majesty’s Government would be largely based upon the reports they received from these authorities, but he could assure Fuad Bey that the claims of King Abdul Aziz would receive full and fair consideration. FUAD BEY HAMZA said that he would like to take this opportunity to mention that the names given in his letter and subsequent memorandum were not only of wells, but also of places and dist ricts . As the names had been obtained from Bedouin tribesmen, it would obviously be impossible to find many of them on the maps. Some of the wells and places mentioned were, however, close to the Qatar peninsula or the coast of the Persian Gulf and were quite well known. Mr. RENDEL then concluded the discussion of the south-eastern frontiers by informing Fuad Bey that the reply of His Majesty’s Government to his two communications would be returned to the Saudi Government in due course through His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. n. / The discussion then turned to the question of the Bahrein transit dues. Mr. RENDEL said that he feared it would not be possible to prepare draft notes embodying the agreement reached at the local conference in time for them to be shown to Fuad Bey before he left England on the 22nd July. The wording of the letter from the Bahrein delegation detailing the concessions their Govern ment was prepared to make to Saudi Arabia was not entirely clear in some respects, and it would probably be necessary for the draft notes to be referred to the Government of Bahrein for concurrence before they were communicated to the Saudi Government. At the same time Mr. Rendel wished to repeat the formal assurance he had given Fuad Bey at their previous meeting that the Government of Bahrein would not at any future time again penalise ships (like the s.s. Ahmedi) calling at Bahrein and carrying cargo direct to the mainland of Arabia without tranship ment in Bahrein waters. His Majesty’s Government intended to confirm this perpetual assurance in a separate note to be addressed to the haudi Government at the time of the main exchange of notes. [456 y—1] B THE following were Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm.2 FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he had not received any recent instructions from his (xovernment about this question, and so was not in a position to do more than take note of w T hat Mr. Rendel said. He suggested, how ever, that it might be useful if he were to see the draft notes before they were formally communicated to the Saudi Government for their concurrence. After further discussion it was agreed that as soon as the draft notes had been approved by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrein, copies of them should be sent to Sheikh Hafiz \\ abba for onward transmission to Fuad Bey Hamza, wherever he might then be in the course of his leave. At the same time the draft notes would be sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, who would be instructed to communicate them formally to the Saudi Government for their concurrence, as soon as Fuad Bey Hamza had expressed his personal agreement with the terms employed in the drafts. III. Mr. RENDEL next referred to the debt due from the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. He explained that His Majesty’s Government had no desire to embarrass the Saudi Government by raising this matter; but their position, too, was not easy since they were liable to criticism in Parliament and by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons if steps were not taken with a view to liquidating the debt. His Majesty’s Government had learned with much satisfaction of the repayment by the Saudi Government last May of their half share of the cost of the enquiry- conducted by Mr. Macdonell in 1931 into the rival claims arising out of tribal raids between Transjordan and the Hejaz and Nejd, and of their payment of 10 per cent, of the capital of the larger debt for £31,437 4s. 6rf. due on account of arms and ammunition supplied to King Ibn Sand in 1929. His Majesty’s Government would now be grateful to learn the intentions of the Saudi Govern ment in regard to the repayment of the remainder of the arms debt, and he was authorised to inform Fuad Bey that if satisfactory arrangements could be made for the repayment of the outstanding 90 per cent, of the capital of the debt within a reasonable period, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to take a sympathetic view of the question of interest on the debt. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he would look into the matter with a view to producing a statement of the intentions of his Government about the repayment of the remainder of the debt. IV. The next matter to be touched upon was the future of the Treaty of Jedda, and the connected questions of slavery and the traffic in arms. Mr. RENDEL said that he was now authorised to inform Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in principle to extend the validity of the Treaty of Jedda for a further seven years by means of an exchange of notes, on the lines already suggested by Fuad Bey, provided that a satisfactory settle ment were reached on the question of slavery and the other outstanding points of less importance. SIR A. RYAN pointed out that in his draft exchange of notes Fuad Bey had suggested prolonging the treaty for ten years. Mr. RENDEL replied that he had mentioned seven years because that was the period of validity of the original treaty. He thought that neither nj Majesty’s Government nor the Saudi Government were ready just yet to concluo a new treaty, and, in the circumstances, he agreed with Fuad Bey that tnei would be advantage in stabilising relations between their two countries prolonging the existing treaty for a definite term of years. As a new treaty wou probably be a subject for negotiation before very long, he thought seven vea might be a sufficient period. At the same time,^ there would, of course, w question of the treaty automatically expiring at the end of the seven years, it would continue to run on indefinitely, as at present, subject to denuncia at six months’ notice.FUAD BIA suggested that the treaty might be prolonged for ten veaiN unless a new treaty were negotiated in the meanwhile. g y ’ , ^ ^ ENDK m t nd SI ? A -. RYAN thought that this was a useful formula, Government ^ C0U C &gt;e n ° 0 ^i ec t lon &gt; ail d agreed to recommend it to His Majesty’s The discussion then turned to the question of slavery and manumission in relation to the prolongation of the treaty. r reminded Fuad Bey that the whole question of the renewal of the tieaty hinged on a settlement being reached on this issue which would be satisfactory from the point of view of their respective Governments. He under- stood from Sir A. Ryan that his private discussions with Fuad Bey had shown that there was a good prospect of agreement, although there were still a few points outstanding about which Sir Andrew was not entirely happy, particularly ^ reluctance of Fuad Bey to agree to make the clause in the regulations affording redress to persons who could show that they had been illegally enslaved m the past, applicable to persons enslaved prior to the establishment of the present regime in the Hejaz. If Sir A. Ryan felt any doubts about the adequacy of the slavery regulations which the Saudi Government were proposing to issue. Fuad Bey could be sure that they would not satisfy public and parliamentary opinion in this country when it became necessary for His Majesty’s Government to justify the surrender of their right of manumission. FI AD BEY observed that His Majesty’s Government were not alone in experiencing difficulties over the slavery question. He had only received very general instructions from King Abdul Aziz to guide him in his negotiations on the subject, and he feared that in his discussions with Sir Andrew Rvan he might already have gone too far and be unable to obtain approval for the concessions he had offered. He begged His Majesty’s Government to realise that King Abdul Aziz had himself to reckon with the force of public opinion in regard to slavery, which was an ancient and established institution in Arabia, sanctified by Islamic law and tradition. His Majesty would have to consult his tribal and religious leaders, and they might well, if only from motives of self-interest, refuse to agree to the far-reaching measures that were now proposed. Fuad Bey pointed out that, in introducing reforms on the subject of slavery, King Abdul Aziz would have to contend with a mass of vested interests, as well as with the religious feelings of important sections of the population. Mr. RENDEL and SIR ANDREW RYAN replied that they fully appreciated the difficulties that confronted King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government and were most anxious that His Majesty should, if possible, obtain the prior consent of the ulema and the tribal leaders before introducing the proposed reforms. Mr. RENDEL desired, however, to point out that His Majesty’s Government were only asking King Abdul Aziz to carry out certain reforms that were, in any case, inevitable before very long, if, as they hoped, Saudi Arabia were to continue to maintain its present rate of progress under the enlightened rule of His Majesty and to take its proper international place in the modern world. The indefinite continuance of slavery as an institution was not possible in the conditions of the present day, and he cited the trouble which Abyssinia was experiencing through the continuance of slavery within her borders. He begged Fuad Bey to submit to King Abdul Aziz the result of his conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan on the subject of slavery, and to try to obtain from His Majesty some definite and far-reaching proposals which could be laid before Ministers here as a satisfactory counterpart to the surrender of the right of manumission. Once agreement had been reached on the question of slavery, nothing would stand in the way of the Treaty of Jedda being prolonged. FUAD BEY promised to do his best to produce as soon as possible the final proposals of his Government. It was agreed that when these were available they would be submitted to Ministers without delay, and a communication containing the views of His Majesty’s Government would then be made to the Saudi Government through His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. The discussion then turned to the question of the prolongation or modification of the exchange of notes (Nos. 5 and 6) at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda in regard to purchases of arms by the Saudi Government. [456 y—1] B ^4 SIR ANDREW RYAN reminded Fuad Bey that this matter had been discussed at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, when it had been agreed that it involved points of form, rather than of substance. He had now been able to go into the question more deeply, in consultation with the competent Department of the Foreign Office. There were two difficulties connected with the note written by Sir G. Clayton at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda. That note referred to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and the reference implied certain qualifications of the assurance contained in it. That convention was now, however, dead, and a new agreement was in contemplation, which existed only in draft form. There would be no new regulation, Sir A. Ryan understood, providing for special zones, but, on the other hand, the question of possible restrictions on the supply of arms in abnormal circumstances had attracted increasing attention. It would be necessary to devise a new formula more in accordance with these developments than that embodied in the original note. Mr. RENDER explained that the position was that it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to qualify their assurance on the arms traffic in order to bring it into line with any existing or impending international commitments by which they might be bound, but that any such qualification would be one of purely general application. There would be no question of discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. FUAD BEY thanked Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr. Rendel for the explanations they had given. He said that he had, however, been uneasy at hearing Mr. Rendel at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, state that His Majesty’s Government did not intend to treat the Saudi Government “ in a less favourable way than any other friendly country in a similar position.” He thought that the expression “ in a similar position ” might imply discrimination. Mr. RENDEL replied that he had been obliged to use the words quoted by Fuad Bey on account of the provisions in the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention establishing “ special zones ” in different parts of the world, within which the signatory countries bound themselves to sell arms only to Governments or their accredited agents, on account of the risk of any sale of arms to warlike and turbulent tribal elements leading to unrest and possible revolts. He realised that zones of this nature did imply a certain discrimination, but he pointed out that it was essentially in the interests of the Governments of countries within the zones that there should be a prohibition of the private import of arms and ammunition. He understood from Sir Andrew Ryan, who had been in touch with the experts on the subject at the Foreign Office, that it was unlikely that any future Arms Traffic Convention would contain provision for “ special zones.” Nevertheless, he felt obliged to make a reservation on the point, as it was still possible that some alternative system might eventually be adopted by which certain groups or categories of countries should be subject to special regulations. He repeated, however, that there would be no question of discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. FL AD BEY remarked that the Saudi Government were naturally mo re anxious than anybody else that arms should not be supplied illicitly to private individuals in their country. But they did not like any form of discrimination, and they could only agree to safeguards such as those underlying the idea of j “ special zones ” if they were embodied in general terms applying to the world as a whole. After further discussion, SIR ANDREW RYAN undertook that as soon as a copy of the new draft Arms Traffic Convention had been obtained, he would try to work out a formula for embodying the original assurance of His Majesty’s Government in revised and up-to-date terms. V. Mr. RENDEL concluded the meeting by enquiring, with reference to the discussion at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, whether Fuad Bey was now in a position to make any statement about the recent conference between the delegates of Saudi Arabia and Koweit to discuss the problem of their mutual economic relations.5 FUAD BEY replied that he had received a long communication from his Government. Unfortunately, however, its contents were not clear to him in all respects, and he regretted that he was not therefore in a position to make any statement on the subject. Mr. RENDEL drew Fuad Bey’s attention once more to the importance which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India attached to an early settlement of the present economic deadlock between the two countries. He expressed the hope that every effort would be made to reach agreement on the basis of the proposals of the Sheikh of Koweit, and that the Saudi Government would abandon their insistence on a guarantee that no single smuggler would be allowed to cross the border from Koweit into Saudi Arabia.

He at present resides in Kuwait, because he is 'wanted” by Bin Saud, and living here is more healthy in consequence. 2. Of Fuad f s list of wells my man knows the following personally, or has good hearsay knowledge of them: 2,3,4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 26, 31, 32,52, 70,71,72,73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82 , 83, 86, 87, 88, 92, 94, 97, 106, 107, 116, 117, 121 123, 157, 158, 159, 161. 3. He furthermore assures me that the Murra 'dira” stretches south in Ihe form of a rough elongated parallelogram frcm close to Hoffuf down to the wells of 'Shanna', 'Mamura', ’’Zuwaira' and 'Turaiwa' (See Philby’s map and point furtherest south which he reached, also Thomas map), and is more or less enclosed in the area bounded by the following. (a) Western Boundary. 5Tcm Hofuf down the Eastern side of the Sunman plateau to 'Maqainama' wells leaving the irfhole of the Jabrin Oasis to the Iwurra. From 'Maqainama 1 wells' the boundary goes by a curved line south-east to'Shanna wells”, (See HUlby^s Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel G.Looh, C.i.S. .i.A. , Political Resident in the Persian -.ulf , BUSH IRE.2 fe) ( b &gt; J . Q'^dary runs South-east approximately along the line of wells known as ^anurqa, Bir al Nabit, BAHATH, Bir Azila, round the southern edge of the Q,atar boundary to Sabkhat liatti (See Thomas I.Iap) a marshy strip running some 40 miles into the interior from the sea coast. (c) Eastern Boundary, runs from the Sabkhat Matti in a south-easterly straight line to t f Sabkhat Mi jar a' at the junction of the parallels 54°and 20? (d) Southern Boundary. From Sabkhat Lijora to shanna wells, and includes the Al Rashid tribal country.(This latter tribe bi being n beni iim n of the Murra, and an offshoot of the tribe of that name living in Hejran). To make my meaning clear I enclose a rou^i sketch, showing also Thomas route up the centre. 4. My informant was insistent that east of the Sabkhat Llutti lay the Manasir tribal country, which in similar - fashion extended right south to the Al RAMIA (heavy sands) keeping the Murra tt dira ,t on their left. 5. Similarly to the east of the Manasir tf dira n , lay the Awamir tribal country known as the Dhafra, and so on to the various tribes lying West of Jabal xdchdar, all of whom had a wedge of territory running into the heart of the 'Ramla'. 6 . The Murra being good 'Sunnis’’, had little to do with the Manasir and avoided them and their country and did not marry with them, for the reason that, though of good stock, they (the iianasir) followed the Khawarij creed, which was southing akin to the Shiah belief and so abhorrent. 7. Not content with the above evidence, I sought out and found another old AJmi tribesman, *o also is releted to the Murra by marriage and apparently knows their country as far as Shanna. This person who I have known for 7 years now, and have always found reliable,man told me. reliable, corroborated all that the first He however added that since there was a 'HUQUM' in Nejd, (meaning the strong aim of Bin Baud), there was for less enmity between the Hurra and the Sai f ar, Manakhil, and other tribes of the Dhofar hinterland, and that groups of these penetrated North into hi Rashid and Hurra country to the 20th parallel of latitude and ^ grazed with the Hurra in the Spring, xuid now to come to questions 2(a) and (b) of your D.0, under reference: (a) Beyond what I have already said in para 2 above, I cannot, I am afraid, say whether the 161 wells mentioned by Fuad Hamza, all belong to the Hurra tribe, or include Manasir and Awamir wells also, I should, hazarding a guess, say the names have been obtained from a full blown Murri, who might have been encouraged to give names of wells not strictly belonging to his tribe. (A bedouin will nearly always try and make out he owns a bigger 'dira' than he actually does), I have closely compared Fuad Hamza’s list of wells also with those given on Philby’s and Thomas maps and find that Nos. 1,4,5,8, 9,11,12,15,27 , 28, 75, 76, 77, 86, 87, 88, 94, 106, 107, 124, 125, 154, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161 are mentioned on Philby’s mp, and Nos.l, 8, 18, 65, 72, 75, 74, 75, 77, 78, ©9 79 81, 82, 85, 89, 90, 98, 101, 115, 117, 118, ) 9 9 148, 159, and 161 are found on Thomas map, but of course beyond the fact that the existence &lt;f these wells is proved neither map shows to whom the wells especially the Sastem.ones, belong. (b) I should say that Bin Baud and his Lieutenant Bin Jiloui today do exercise entire and real authority over all the Murra and over the whole of their country, but not in the sense that you or His9./ - 4 - -IS Majesty's Government might possibly think: To explain what I mean:- -he Murra,^ other tribes for that matter, can not hope to exist during the Summer months in the '.ut al Khali region or in any part of it. They must move north to more congenial climes, where they can graze and water their camels daily. ^uch places they find in the great Jabrin Oasis, (essentially their oral headquarters) roundabout Hoifuf. That is the time when Bin Baud taxes them and takes '^ikat'** In the Winter and Spring and immediately after rain has fallen in the Bub al ^^ali» out go the iViUrra, and they disappear tind scatter among the sandy wastes, until it is time to come north again for the summering period. Bin Baud therefore never has to bother to send out tax-gatherers further than Hoffuf and Jabrin. On the other hand, should a Shaikh be wanted in the Spring grazing season, a single man (fidawi) or tribal employee of Bin Saud has but to move down to where the tribe is grazing, and he soon finds his man. A verbal order from him does the rest. Ho man dare disobey such messengers summons, it is as much as his life is worth to do so. He knows he will be 'got” when Summer comes like a bird walking into a cage. Should the Manasir, i^wamir or other neighbouring tribe start raiding the Murra, so as to become a nuisance (this can only happen in the Winter ani Spring) then it is up to Bin Saud or Bin Jaloui to send a 'Ghazzu' to assist them deal with the situation. This is the tribes due, since they have paid Zikat. | y(a) Bp^adary. From Hoffuf down the eastern side oi the oumman plateau to Muqainama wells leaving the whole 01 tiie Jabrm Oasis to the Hurrah. From Maqainama wells the boundary goes by a curved line south-east to Shanna wells, (see Philby*s and Thomas* maps). (*&gt;) Morl&amp;ern Boundary runs south-east approximately along the line of wells (see Philby’s map) known as Zanurqa, Bir al Habit, Bahath, Bir A^ila, round the southern edge of the Qatar boundary to Sabkhat Matti (see Thomas* map) a marshy stip running some 40 miles into the interior from the sea coast* (c) Eastern boundary runs from the Sabkhat Matti in a south-easterly straight line to M Sabkhat Mijora’* at the junction of the parallels 54°and 2CP. (d) Southern Boundary . From Sabkhat Mijora to Shanna wells, . and includes the Al Rashid tribal country. (Al Rashid are kin of the Morrah, and an offshoot of the tribe of that name living in Hajran). 3. Dickson's informant also states that east oi the Sabkhat Matti lies the kanasir tribal country, which in similar fashion extends right south to the Al Ramla (heavy sands) keeping the Morrah 'dira' on their west. Similarly to the east of the Manasir ’‘dira', lies the Awamir tribal country known as the Dhafrah, and so on to the various tnoes lying west of Jabal Akhdar, all of whom have a wedge of territory running into the heart oi the n Ramla . The ^orrali, being Sunni, have little to do with the Manasir and avoid them and their country andho not marry with them, for Hie reason that, though of good stock, they (the Manasir) follow the Khawarij creed, which was something akin to tue -hi and so abhorrent. 4, /6k Confidential.

Bin Saud wields some authority over the Manasir through their paramount chief who lives in Hasa and has occasion ally extracted zakat from other tribes even up to Bakraimi I think that it is fair to put it that his personal prestige and thfct of Jiluwi gives him considerable influence but (except in case of Manasir) hardly authority even to the east of the A1 Morrah area. This influence rapidly dwindles as one moves eastwards and I ao not think that he exercises any authority over Muscat Oman tribes* 2 . In informal conversation in October 1934, Sultan told Bremner what he considered boundaries of Sultanate.

Bear Colonel Loch, I am writing these few lines to tell you that though I did my best to get the information you required about the A1 Morrah dira the results were negative as I had expected owing to the lack of knowledge of the country of the people from whom 1 was able to make enquiries without raising suspicion. Only two of the guards whom we had had ever travelled in that country and their knowledge was often scantiest - the only people who are at all likely to help would be some of the southern bedu of Q,atar who were of course out gracing whilst I was at f Anaiza. fe completed the work Satisfactorily and left Dohah on 4th September and arrived safely in Bahrain after a pleasant voyage of 17 hours in a local launch. The key was handed over to the Shaikh who installed a M hatur rt the day we left and whom I was able to help by giving him several rt hasina'' to build a hut with and also a large number of empty petrol tins to simplify his water problem for which he was very grateful. Must say I enjoyed the work at Dohah, notwithstanding my poor health at the time, as everyone from the Shaikh downwards was so pleased to see us and so helpful. 1 hear try relief is now in Basra so I may get av/ay on the trooper after all l Please give my sincerest respects to ^rs.Loch, hoping you are both in good health.

By repeating to His Majesty’s Government his protest against Qatar oil concession, Ibn Saud makes it necessary to deal with substance of his complaint. his protest by a firm statement of their position regarding the frontier question, especially as their attitude on this subject has already been clearly defined not only to Saudi Government but to United States Government and to United States oil interests who hold concession in Saudi territory. But in the present delicate situation in the Red Sea they desire to avoid driving Ibn Saud^towards the Italians for support which they would be only too ready to offer and which he might accept - notwithstanding the obvious dangers to himself - if he felt he were being hardly treated by His Majesty’s Government* 3 # in the circumstances you may, subject to the views of the Government of India and of Political Resident, 2 . In norma.! circumstances they would have met to turn replyreply in writing to Yusuf Yasin to the following effect* 4. His Majesty’s Government, when they learned oi his letuer were about to address the Saudi Government in regard to their action in couresponding direct with th( Shaikh of '^atar on a subject which since His Majesty's Government are responsible for the Shaikh's foreign relations, falls within their sphere* You should then make a communication as instructed in paragraph 3 of my telegram 104 introducing a reference to the Note quoted in negotiations in which His Majesty's Government participated and which they saw no reason to delay* Shaikh of v^atar on the 17th May last granted to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with the full approval of His Majesty’s Government, concession for exploitation of oil etc., in his territory* As Saudi Government have been informed, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared in derogation of their strict legal rights to offer the Saudi(s) important concessions at the northern end of the frontier line and to admit • Saudi sovereignty up to the so called H Green Line” of which you should repeat the definition* But as was pointed out to Fuad Bey in London last June this line represents the utmoot concession which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are able to offer in this area compatibly with their obligations to other Rulers concerned* Reasons why His Majesty’s GSvernment in the United Kingdom are unable to contemplate further concessions in this sector were fully Ryan’s telegram No.39 5 You should then explain that after long explained to Fuad 6- 3 - o0U ^^ ern of oil concession granted to Anglo-Persian Oil Company by Shaikh of ^atar not only does not extend beyond this Green line but lies to a considerable distance to the north* of it. Concession does not therefore extend to any territory under discussion with Saudi Government* Moreover His Majesty’s Government in the ^ .United Kingdom have formally assured Shaikh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights - more particularly over area covered by concession. In view of language of Ibn Saud's letter to Shaikh of Qatar, His Majesty’s Government must make this point clear and draw Saudi Governments attention to terms of Articl'e 6 of/' Treaty of Jedda by which Ibn Saud undertook inter alia to maintain friendly relations with the Shaikh of Qatar, whose special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government he specifically recognises. 8* In these circumstances the frontier question cannot be affected by the grant or exploitation of thas concession. For your own information grant of a concession could not in any case prejudice legal rights of either party ever territory to which it purports to extend. 9. You should add that His Majesty’s Government appreciate and reciprocate Saudi Government's desire to reach early agreement on the frontier question and that they hope that discussion on this subject may be profitably resumed on Ryan's return to Arfebia. y - secretary of state for - FOREIGN AFFAIRS ~odv sent to P.A., Bahrain under P.L.N0.745-S dated 22.9*1^35, ref*.
