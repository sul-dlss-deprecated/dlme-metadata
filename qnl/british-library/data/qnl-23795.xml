Dear Bursary Officer, V&lt;e have received Council Circular letter 109 inforiain&amp; us that there are two scholarships . allotted to tne Persian Gull*, and mentioning that these may be turned into bursaries. Since it is most unlikely that wa shall find any scholar ship candidates we are very interested in the latter possibility. Unfortunately we have none of the previous instructions on the subject of bursaries $ and although we sscared from *JLss Caffrey the circular letter ho.93 referred to in paragraph 6 of Circular 109&gt; this does not give adequate details of the basis on which candidates for bursaries are selected, age limits (if any) amount of money granted, period for which they are granted etc. Could you please send us copies of all the instructions which have been issued regarding bursaries? It wculd save time if you would send similar sets of instructions to the political kgents in £ahraix M Kuwait and Muscat, to whom we are sending a copy of this letter. fours ever, Residency.

M’S POlitiCa 1 Arror&gt; + Bahrain, 4,TOn+ /^\ U :A 9 sNOV I949 Memorandum:- Reference your Memorandum 'No,237'\ -’16^ dated 1st November 19^-9» We would gladly suggest a candidate for the scholar ship which is being offered by the British Council but there are in Bahrain no young men who have achieved the requisite degree courses which would entitle them to be considered for a scholarship. We have one young man among those who are being educated at the American Univer sity of Beirut, who at one time held a British Council scholarship. He is now being paid for by the Bahrain Government. He, it is hoped, will get his degree next year. In return for being paid for by the Government he has engaged himself to enter Government service, for not less than two years, after completing his education. If the scholarship is available next year he might be considered as a candidate. 2. These two scholarships are for the Persian Gulf, a condition being that candidates should have completed university degree courses. It is possible, although I think it is unlikely, that men with these qualifications may be found in Kuwait but at present there are none in Bahrain. Could it be suggested to the British Council that if they are interested in encouraging education in Bahrain by offering scholarships they should provide a I ' scholarship for a student who has completed his Secondary education and not for one who has completed a University^ degree Course? This would make it possible for someone in Bahrain to benefit. 3. The Government gives scholarships every year to one or two young men from the Secondary School to the American University of Beirut. The British Council I presume would not be able to give scholarships to the American University of Beirut but if, instead of the scholarship referred to in your letter, they granted a scholarship to a Bahrain boy' to one of the provincial universities in England, such as Exeter or Bristol, it would be a very valuable assis tance. If this is not possible I would like to suggest that a scholarship might be granted to a Technical School, Agricultural School or Engineering School in England for which it would be possible to find suitable candidates from Bahrain, Adviser to the Government.The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.

Telegrams: Britcoun, Wesdo, London Telephone: MAYfair 8484 Circular Letter Ho, 93 GEN/164/2 18 th March, 1949* Dear Representative, Short-temi Bursary Scheme 1949/50 Please refer to circular GEN/1 64/2 of 22nd May, 1947, and Circular Letter No. 67 (GEN/ 163 /l) of 31st August, 1948, Submission of Applications . In the administration of the Bursary Allocation.and of' the funds accruing from the conversion of Scholarships to Bursaries, we are endeavouring to ensure an even flow of arrivals in the United Kingdom throughout the twelve months commencing 1st April, 1949, and, in view of the substantial and inevitable time-lag between the date of reception of application forms and the date of the announcement of placings to Representatives overseas, it will be of the greatest assistance if applications can be submitted at least three or'four months before the date on which candidates would be able to arrive in the United Kingdom, Accordingly, we shall not normally be able to consider for the award of Bursaries in the financial year 1949/50 applications submitted after October, 1949. This is particularly important in the case of distant areas from which travel to the United Kingdom is difficult to arrange. In certain* cases we have already received applications from Representatives and these are being considered. 2, This request does not affect in any way the provision mentioned in paragraph 6 of Circular Letter No. 67 in which it is mentioned that all proposals for conversion of scholarships to bursaries should be made when short lists of scholarship candidates are submitted to Students Department in January. 3 3. Persons covered by the Scheme . Whilst the Council desires the Scheme to be elastic, the Technical and Industrial Sub-Committee of the Universities Advisory Committee, on which employers and trade unions are both represented, have recently recommended a rather greater proportion of candidates from industry, particularly at the foreman level or below. It is realised that social or economic conditions in certain areas prevent the selection of artisan bursars and in those cases it may be expedient that the selection be made from professional workers at a level rather higher than is possible in other areas. Usually, preference will be given to Bursars who will be able to perform their normal duties in British firms or institutions. P. T. 0. 9,324Knowledge of English . It has been found from our experience in the past twelve months that a rather higher standard of English is required than was suggested in our circular of 22nd May, 1947# There are few sections of British industry in which a Bursar without a good • command of the English language will be able to settle down happily for three or four months. Accordingly it is requested that each candidate be tested for his knowledge of.spoken English and preference be given to those candidates who may be expected to adjust themselves in a very short space of time to the conditions in Britain, Qualifications and experience . The administration of the Scheme in the past twelve months has been considerably hindered by the lack of detailed information on candidates’ qualifications and experience. In order to facilitate placing, it is essential that the application form should contain the fullest possible details of the candidate's day-to-day employment throughout several years before the date of the application, A note on the candidate's educational background should also be included. Personal Factors . Though in general the type of Bursar we have been receiving in the last twelve months has been very satisfactory, there have been several cases of Bursars who, for personal reasons, have been unable to obtain the fullest benefit from their stay in the United Kingdom, It is of the utmost importance to ensure that each candidate is interviewed, if possible by the Representative himself, or by a senior official of the Council, before application forms are submitted to Students Department. We suggest that at the interviews candidates should be acquainted with living conditions in the United Kingdom which, though accepted sympathetically by the majority of our Bursars in the last twelve months, have prevented one or two from appreciating fully what is of value in this country, Whilst we take the greatest care In acclimatising Bursars to life in the United Kingdom during their i irst week here, there is always the danger that owing to the brevity of their visit, they may be unable to obtain any real appreciation of the finer points of our British way of life and may leave with an exaggerated sense of its minor inconveniences. Dejection Committees . In order that we may be in possession of relevant and detailed information regarding candidates' qualifications and experience in their trade or profession and also to ensure that Industrial candidates selected overseas will stand the best chance of acceptance by British industry, it is strongly advised that candidates be interviewed by a committee which includes the British Labour Attache and the Commercial Counsellor or Attache where possible. The Ministry of Lab cur and the Board of Trade have already circulated particulars of the Short Term Bursary Scheme to appropriate Brutish officials overseas. It may be found that these officials if asked will be able to suggest ways of finding good candidates. Placi ng Conditions in the United Kingdom . The Technical and Industrial Sub-Committee have recommended that we should,where possible, provide overseas Representatives of the Council with information regarding placing possibilities in the United Kingdom, Owing to the rapidly changing situation, however, we have up to the\ - 3 - present confined this service to the provision of general confidential information to those Representatives who have made special application for guidance. The Bursary Section of Students Department is gradually accumulating information on placing and will be glad to provide general placing notes for those Representatives who request them. When rather more experience has been gained it is hoped to issue to Representatives a more general memorandum on the facilities which have been offered. Yours ever, A.E. MORGAN CONTROLLER.

Telegrams: Britcoun, Telex, London Telephone: MAYfair 8484 itef: GEN/164/2 Students Department, 39 Grosvenor Square, W. 1. Dear Representative, 9th November, 1949. 1. Further to Circular Letter No, 93 dated 18th March 1949 concerning the operation of the Bursaries Scheme, I should like to bring to your notice a number of minor changes and suggestions which will affect the operation of the Scheme next year* These concern points of administration rather than of policy. With the expansion of the Scheme it becomes essential that the v/erk shall now be directed along rather more formal lines and these points are intended to make for the smooth working of the Scheme both at home and abroad. 2. Financial Provision , As you are aware, money becomes available for Bursaries in accordance with the Council’s Financial Year (April 1st to March 31st), whether the Bursaries be secured through direct allocation or by conversion of Scholarship money. To assist in budgeting for Bursaries it is very desirable that where practicable Bursaries should fall wholly within one financial year, though preparation for Bursars will often be made in the preceding year, 3. Timing of Applications . Unlike Scholars, Bursars arrive at any time during the year but it is naturally desirable that those from hot countries shall take up their Bursaries in such a way as to ensure that they are in the United Kingdom during the summer months. 4, It is most helpful to the Bursaries Section if Representatives submit full applications from prospective Bursars a considerable time in advance of the actual Bursary period. Ideally, applications should be sent fairly regularly in order that there may always be, from any country, a short waiting list which can be given preliminary attention from the point of view of placing and programme arrangement. 5. To retain the good will of the firms, ijublic authorities and other institutions concerned in the reception of Bursars it is essential that they be approached in good time and the placing of a candidate should generally be effected at least three months before he arrives. Representatives are urged, therefore, in their first approach to candidates, to make it clear that no promise can be given to them that a Bursary will be available on any particular date but that they should hold themselves in readiness as far as possible to come to the United Kingdom when funds are available and places can be secured, 6. Representatives are asked particularly to submit a certain number of applications in December or January on which preliminary action can be taken to ensure that the Bursars will arrive soon after the Financial Year commences in April. P. T. 0. 10,3807. Snhnls sion • of Applications . Experience has shown that the more information obtainable about a prospective Bursar, the greater are the chances of good placing. Paragraphs 10 to 14 on the Bursary applicati n form should he completed as fully as possible. 1 lb ° , wishes importance to secure from the candidate an exact idea of what he wishes to do in this country. 8 The number of application forms previously used has been found insufficient and with reluctance it is necessary to ask that in future five copies of the application form shall be sent. Only one^copy e of Appendix 'B' (Confidential Report) and of the medical ceraifica e is needed but if there is long delay between the first application of the candidate and his despatch to this country, every eifort should bo mad^ to secure a further medical certificate before the Bursar actually sets out. o xt should be noted that considerable difficulty is still being found in obtaining places for Bursars in the Textile, Dyeing, Motor and Aircraft Industries and also at Dockyards. 10. Conversion of Scholarship Funds . Representatives are reminded that although the opportunity for conversion of Scholarships tc Bursaries has been extended, proposals for such conversion must be submitted with the Scholarship applications m January. 11. Corr espondence on Bursaries should, as far as possible, bu conducted separately and not contained in letters which deal wit Scholarship affairs. Yours over, W.A. SCARR Director, Students Department.

We have been allotted two scholarships for 1950-51 for which no candid ates are available, and we can, thereiore, convert them into bursaries. We enclose a copy of a letter from the British Council showing how this conversion is effected ana it would appear we can obtain financial assist ance for two persons to study in the United Kingdom during 1950-51 and two during 1951-52. We understand from kr. height that arrangements can be made to attach students to factories and firms in England and we have asked him to let us !?ave a list of factories and firms who might be willing to accept students from these parts. We think it possible that leading merchants with sons who have acquired a reason able knowledge of English might welcome the opportunity of sending them to the United Kingdom to stuay on the lines indicated with financial assistance from the British Council.

Description Subject Bursaries.'TV- GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. sr/ 'fj ^ S' No. of 1369 Office of the Adviser to the Grovernment, Bahrain Dated, 6th R/Thani, 1369 January 26, 1950 H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- Reference your Printed Letter No.53-16/28A dated 5th January 1950, the subject of which I dis cussed with Mr. Keight during his recent visit here. I understand that the Council would agree to accept candidates for courses with organisations such as local municipal bodies, water supply works, police, survey etc. etc;, in addition to instruction in factories. In my opinion it would be of greater advantage for Bahrain if a candidate could be given the opportunity of visiting England in order 'to study one of the many branches of local administration. This would benefit the individual and would also be of value to our administration in Bahrain. I would like to enquire whether the Council could offer any sort of course in the following branches a. Municipal administration. I would suggest that it would be really helpful if a young man from Bahrain could be attached to the Municipality of some town* in England, not too large a place, where he would have the opportunity of seeing how town councils and municipal bodies conduct their affairs. I have a suitable can-2 b. C.I.D. We are at present building up a special C*I.D. branch in the State«,Police. It would be a valuable experience for one of our Arab officers to attend for awhile at Scotland Yard and other places where the C„I.D* is active in order to learn at first hand something of modern Police metho-ds, c. Survey, town planning, land registration. The Land Registration Department of the Bahrain Government has been in existence for over 20 years and has done very valuable work but I feel that its work could be improved in many directions if it could acquire some new ideas. I know very little myself about town plan ning and land registration in England but I believe that the new town and country planning organisation is doing a great deal of valuable work. I believe that if one of the senior Arab # s from the Government Land c Registration Department would do a course in England he would bring back with him many useful and new ideas which could be developed in Bahrain. d. Bahrain has recently acquired a water system in Manama, it is an entirely new innovation and none of the local Arabs who are employed on the water supply have seen such an undertaking working elsewhere. We could find a suitable young man who, if he were sent to England to study the practical side of such an undertaking, would benefit considerably. 3. These are the types of courses which I think would be of particular benefit to Bahrain. If you would kindly enquire from the British Council whether they would accept candidates for any of the subjects which I have referred to I will then propose individuals for the particular courses.

The British Consul have informed us that the following institutions and offices v/ill accept bursar as well as students who are prepared to pay their own expenses or if they are sponsored by you for official purposes the Bahrain Government would in that case be expected to bear the expenses:- London Passengers Transport Board.

Memorandum:- Reference your Memorandum No. 83-16/28A dated 6th March 1950, the Bahrain Government is extremely interested in this scheme. I discussed it with the British Council Officials who were here lately and arranged for them to meet two men who I proposed as suitable candidates for municipal administration and Scotland Yard. ^ 2. I shall he able to suggest also a suitable man for air conditioning and refrigerator training, if any firm which deals with such work is willing to accept a bursar. 3. In my letter No. 886-2E dated 26th January 1950, I suggested a bursar to a water works, I now find that we have nobody in this particular line of business who knows enough English to benefit by a course. The Bahrain Government will gladly bear the expenses of two or three bursaries, provided that the British Council will assist by keeping an eye on the bursars. 4. I can suggest no unofficial candidates. Merchants 1 sons, in Bahrain, are not the type of young men who are willing to do courses in factories or workshops and there ty&amp;rM very few local industries in the country for which training in England would be of benefit. It is usually the ambition of merchants f sons to follow their fathers 1 footsteps and occupy the office chair and not to do practical work.

The Bursary officer hsks me to point out that the amount available from the conversion of the first half ,of the scholarship must be spent before the 31 st March, 1951&gt; and if a bursar is to tane advantage of the better weather in the united Kingdom he should arrive in ^ay. The Bursary Officer would, therefore, like nominations for bursaries as soon as possible.*' 2. ns we have heard that neither Kuwait nor Muscat have any candidates for these short term bursaries and as we understand from Simcox's letter to Belgrave BnG/0701/3 of the 7 th March (apparently not copied to you) that the Bahrain Government have put forward two candidates, it appears certain that a Bahraini will be chosen for this bursary.

The total cost ©f a bursary of six months plus return fares is approximately £430 so that it would be necessary for any successful candidate to be able to contribute about £135 from his own resources or with the help of his employers, If, however, you are able t© let us have industrial candidate* from whom we could successfully place one towards the end of the financial year 1950-51, we should be prepared t© keep him here into the beginning ©f the financial year 1951-52 and in this way pay the whole cost of his bursary by making that part of it which falls into the financial year 1951-52 the first commitment on our bursary funds. 3. In view of the high cost of fares from distant countries, Finance Division is reluctant to give authority to bursaries of less than six months to candidates from countries beyond Europe unless a considerable portion of the cost is being contributed by the candidate. 4. In view of our day to day experience, we find it advisable to remind Representatives that it is essential for them to ensure that application forms shall contain the most detailed information under the following heads:- (i) What exactly does the candidate do during his working day? (ii) With the answer to (i) in mind, what, precisely, is it desired that the candidate shall do during his working day in the United Kingdom? (iii) Id it considered appropriate that the candidate shall merely observe and discuss processes, or is it thought that he should, and could, take an active part in them? (iv) Very important - is it considered, in the light of replies to (i), (ii) and (iii) that the candidate could be usefully employed for so long a period as six months and if not, for how long could he be so employed? 5.

Dear Sir, FaCILITILS FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING . My journey to Syria has delayed longer than I would have wished this reply to your inquiry. The choice, so far as Syria and Lebanon go, is this: Aleppo has a Technical College which there is reason to believe was ably run though the Principal has just changed. Admission to the baccalaureate course is between the ages of 16 and 18; candidates must hold the certificate of a technical primary school. The baccalaureate course lasts ^-n two years. Either mechanical engineering or woodwork may be offered. Instruction is free; a charge of L.8.240 is made per annum for board. Application should be made early to the Principal, enclosing a birth certificate. An entrance examination at Aleppo will be necessary if the standing of the Bahrain certificates is uncertain. The Aleppo Technical College is the only one in Syria which prepares for the technical baccalaureate. The course now about to leave is its first. The boarders range from 12 (in the brevet section) to 20 years of age. The Beirut Technical College opens its new section for post-brevet studies this coming school year. The courses offered will include, it is said, mechanical engineering and woodwork; but of the latter confirmation is desirable. The school is intended for Lebanese subjects, but others may be admitted on application through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A trade school also exists and till recently offered 4-year courses. In successive reorganisations it is expected that the two lower^ years will be discontinued. A general observation should be made. Aleppo would be chosen for students from Bahrain only if the unrest which has pervaded Syrian schoolboy circles in the past few years is deemed likely to abate. Beirut on the other hand cannot offer concrete evidence of the value of courses not yet begun. The Lebanese Government is anxious to strengthen the school, which is one of the few educational institutions of note that it controls; the Principal appears able; his Director of Technical Studies is a twiii Swiss of enlightened outlook. The School possesses m#ch equipment of various kinds, but till lately nothing had been installed for the new courses. Yours faithfully, S.H. HOPPER Education Officer.

Please refer to your letter No, 16^2 - 16/28A dated 17th May 1950 and to Mr. Morrell*s letter PG/164/2 dated 27th arch. We have received, through our Representative in Iraq, a copy of Mr. Ealgrave* s letter of 6th April, 1950, addressed to Mr. Simcox together with the application forms of the two candidates mentioned above, both of whom are employed by the Bahrein Government. A From Mr. Balgrave*s letter and Abdul Kerim*s form we gather that the Bahrein Government will pay the cost of Abdul Kerim*s bursary. From your letter, however, we infer that the Bahrein Government is prepared to pay not only the cost of Abdul Kerim*s bursary but also the difference between the money we have available for the Persian Gulf and the cost of a bursary for Ibrahim Khalfan, i.e. £155* I With regard to Abdul Kerim we shall be glad to ask the Home Office to arrange a suitable programme 1 ^: but it is probable that that Department will consider the normal six months which is devoted to^ bursars from the Middle Fast and more distant countries, too long in his case. Three to four months have been found to be sufficient to enable Police Officers to gain the insight they require into methods and practice in the United Kingdom. It seems desirable therefore to verify that the Bahrein Government are prepared to meet the expense of return fares between Bahrein and the United Kingdom for a shorter stay here, than six months. If you will kindly cable the Bahrein Government*s.agreement ^ to Abdul berim*s programme, being from three to four months duration I only, we will immediately endeavour to place him through the Home ' Office and will notify you of the result as soon as possible; we will p 1 so bear in mind the possibility of housing Abdul Kerim at the Anglo-Arab Association*s Hostel, if and when he comes to London, as suggested by Mr. Balgrave. K T e suggest that the Bahrein Government agree that Abdul-Kerim ^ be treated exactly like a full Council bursar and that the cost be estimated on that basis. The Government would pay his return air cassa; e before he leaves Bahrein and so dispose of the fares element. On his arrival , here we should pay him maintenance at the rate of £50 per month in London, Oxford or Cambridge or £25 per month elsewhere. w e should also pay hny additional expenses which might arise ss strictly incidental to his programme, i.e. train fares in the United Kingdom and additional maintenance owing to use of hotels during short visits. ..... The Political Agent, Political Agency, Bahrein.At the end of his period in the United Kingdom we would submit a detailed statement of expenditure, through you, to the Bahrein Government. According to the duration of his stay in the United Kingdom his expenses here vrauld he from £200 to £ 300 ; the latter figure would apply to a period of six months and can be taken as a ceiling. 7 f ith regard to Ibrahim Khalfan, we suggest that the X ' [ Bahrein Government should pay for his return air passage and j notify us of the cost. On his arrival here we should pay the cost of his maintenance for six months which, with minor inci dentals should amount approximately to £170 and should refund ! to the Bahrein Government £12b as a contribution to the cost of his return air passage. If you will kindly include in your cable the Bahrein Government’s agreement to this arrangement in respect of Khalf'S, we will take placing action and inform you of the results of our efforts as early as possible; we doubt, however, if the insight he would receive into local government at Durham, where Mr. Balgrave suggests he should go, would be most suitable for application at Bahrein. with them the cost of two industrial candidates, and we are sympathetic to this proposal. Unfortunately, however, we cannot , consider further expenditure on bursaries for the Persian Gulf in this financial year. * We shall be very glad to do so in the financial year | however, should our bursary budget for that year permit and we would contemplate some such arrangement as paying for one bursary out of two.

I am sorry that we have not to date been able to send you a definite programme, but I am hoping that it will not now be long before something concrete is arranged. * The position briefly is as follows: Our North Regional Office have approached the Town Clerks of Durham, Sunderland and Newcastle, but in each case they cannot offer Ibrahim Khalfan more than a fairly short attachment. This has, therefore, left us with a further three months' programme to arrange. It seemed that a useful complement to an attachment in the industrial North West would be a similar placing in the Town Clerk's Department of a Southern municipality with a rural bias, and in this connection we are making enquiries in Exeter, where the University also has the advantage of possessing a Department of Public Administration. It is hoped that Khalfan may perhaps be able to attend seme of the University lectures. Progress so far then is that Sunderland, Durham and Newcastle have all agreed in principle to take Khalfan for periods of six weeks and a fortnight respectively, and Exeter have been approached with a view to a three months' attachment. As soon as I have definite news from Exeter I will write to you again, but it would meanwhile be extremely helpful if you would kindly let us know by cable whether Khalfan would, in principle, be II prepared to take up a bursary in January, or whether you would ' ‘regard this as too unfavourable a time of year. Our feeling is that if he could spend January/?,larch in the warmer climate of the South West, (and with this in mind we have suggested that the initial placing might be in Exeter concurrently v/ith the University's Lent term), the difficulty might be overcome. Alternatively, Khalfan could delay his arrival until April and take up his various placings in whatever sequence was most convenient. An advantage of Khalfan's arriving in January would be that we could then probably so arrange his programme as to make it possible for him to attend a Local Government course in Oxford, at the conclusion of his attach ments . Y/e are sorry that the placing of this candidate has been some- /-what delayed4 - 2 - lO^ what delayed and hope that you will appreciate our difficulties. Yours ever, - Vj^ J. A.

Bahrain Government, with the recommendation of the British Council, put forward two further candidatec this year. Shortly before the course was due to start the two candidates concerned received letters from the Sector of the College saying that they regretted that they could not be accepted. Ifo reason was given for this decision, nor was the Bahrain Government informed. It was by then of course too late to mane any alternative arrange ment • 3* The Adviser to the Bahrain Government has written to the hector of the College asking the reason for this refusal, and I understand that height of Basra ic tailing the matter up with the Regional Director of the British Council in Nottingham, 4. We should be grateful for any assistance the Foreign Office can give us in obtaining places for Bahraini teachers of iinglish at, Nottingham. We do not know the grounds on which the Nottingham University have refused to accept any candidates from Bahrain for the current academic year. If it is only because they have not room for them we would ask that in future years some kind of priority should, if possible, be given to Bahraini candidates in view of our special responsibility here. The Bahrain Government were extremely pleased with the treatment accorded to the two teachers last year and the results achieved and are anxious to send two teachers for training each year for the next five or six years. 2 As a result f this favourable impression the J• P.

As you know the Bahrain Government proposed to send two young school teachers to the teachers training course at Nottingham University at the ■beginning of the last term, in October. The candidates had been vetted by the British Council Officials who were in Bahrain during the Spring. All the necessary application forms had been sent in and the Government v/as under the impression that the two young men would be accepted. In August the two candidates received letters from the Assistant Begistrar saying that they were not among the students who were chosen for the course. I then wrote to the Registrar expressing disappointment and asking if I could be told for what reason the two men were not accepted. The Assistant Registrar replied that as the Tutor for overseas students was away he was not able to inform me why they were not accepted. I have heard nothing more since then, I enclose copies of the tv/o letters. I now understand that it might be possible for the students to be admitted for the next term which begins in January.Mm » m '** - 2 - Would it 'be possible for you to o'btain help from the Foreign Office in this matter?
