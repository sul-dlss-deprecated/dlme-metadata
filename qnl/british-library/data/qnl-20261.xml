Colonial Office, Downing street. 9 &gt;083/32. 11th May, 1932. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir P .ilip Gunlifre gister to state for the information of the secretary oi State for India that in connection with the application of the Ira i Governinent for admission to the League of Hations, he has had under consideration the question of the frontiers of Iraq, including tiiat between Iraq and Koweit. 2. , As Sir Samuel Eoare is aware, the history of the frontier between Ira and Koweit is as follows. 'The Koweit frontiers were laid down in iie An^lo-Turkish. Agreement of Hie 29th of July,1913. This Ajreemcnt wss never ratified, out in 1923 the Shaikh of ICo v eit was inforraed that His Majesty's Government reco nised the frontier claimed by him between Koweit and Iraq. This frontier is indicated by a reen line on the map which forme a annex 5 to the agreement of 191 , and is al o shown in -reen on L5ap II annexed to the Historical Gunmary of Events for it : tne period 1907-1928 (P.B.13), which was prepared in 19&gt;8 for the Persian r iilf 3ub-Commit tee of the Committee of r ry Imperial Defence. Kor convenience of reference the O .A r - aefinition of the frontier claimed oy the Shaikh and recO::,ni ed by His llajesty's (government is set out in a note attached to this letter. In this connection, reference is ' invited to your letter Ho. P.2306 of the 20th of June,1933, and the connected correspondence, ana to your letter to the f ? ' Foreign Office Ifo. P.Z»5650/31 of the 26th of October. 1931. yv «V #• Uie Under Secretary o' State, India Office.4 J Cy 3. is important; that when applying for membership of the League of Hations, the Iraq Government should he in a position to show that Iraq, possesses well- defined frontiers with all bordering states. While it may be argued that this requirement is fulfilled in the ease of Kowelt, it is thought advisable that the frontier should now 'be defined in a formal manner by instruments which would be suitable for production if necessary at Geneva. 4. After consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding the question of Iraq's frontiers in general, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister considers that the best course would be for the existing frontier between Iraq, and ICoweit to be re-affirmed in an iLxohange of Botes between the Iraqi Government and the Shaikh of Koweit which in the case of Koweit should have the approval of His Majesty's Government. It is, of course, realised that the approval of His Majesty's Government in mis case has no relevance in so far as the League of Hat loss is concerned, since Koweit does not come Y/ithin the purview of that body. Nevertheless, Sir Samuel Hoare will doubtless agree that since the foreign relations of Koweit ere under he control of His Majesty 1 s Government it is important to avoid what might constitute a precedent for independent actio i on the part of the Shaikh in the foreign affairs of his country, 5. It is, therefore, suggested that the settlement should take the form of an Exchange of ITotes as follows:- (a) a note from the Iraq,! Prime Minister to the Shaikh of Koweit puttin forward the pr posal for a re-affirmation of the existin frontier on behalf of the Iraq -overnment. (b) a letter from the Shaikh to the Political Agent at Koweit reportin ;; the proposal and asicin^, for the approval of His Majesty's Government; (c)(c) a letter from the Political Agent to the Shaikh in reply to Cb) conveying the approval of His Majesty's Government; (d) a note from the Shaikh to the Iraqi Prime Minister taking note of an, accepting the proposal in (a), (Letters (b) and (c ) would not befor publication except in cases of necessity). It is proposed to follow a sinil-xr procedure, mutati s mutandis , in the case of the Ir aq-Tran s-J or dan frontier. 6. As it is very desirable that this question, together with the other outstanding questions affectin, Iraq's frontiers should be settled before the September session of the Assembly of the League of Nations, Sir rhilip Cunliffe-Idster would be glad to be informed as early as possible whether iir G muel Hoare concurs in the procedure suggested in the preceding paragraphs. If So, steps will immediately be tali en to convey the necessary instructions to the Sigh Commissioner for Iraq and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It is not anticipated that any difficulty will be experienced In obtainin, the Iraqi Government's consent to the proposed arran; erierit, 7.

I am directed to refer to your telegrora dated the 10th June 1932, regarding the Iraq-Kuwait frontier. 2. You,will of course realise that there is not the smallest 'basis for the Shailch's apprehensions on the subject. As fax)as the Honourable the i ?olitical Hesident is aware, there is no dispute about the frontier, which, as laid down in the Colonial Office letter forwarded to you under my endorseraent Mo. 321-S of 24th nay, is accepted by both parties^ and the reaffirioation, so far from lead- ing to any attempt at alteration, will|definitely prevent any such attempt either now or in the future, sir Hugh Biscoe considers that ao far from this being in any way detrimental to the Shaikhls interests the reaffirmation will definitely safeguard them. He trusts therefore that you will be able to allay his apprehensions. Ho shares yx your views regarding the undesirability of the •Iraq authorities addressing the ShaiKh direct and, as yoi|will see from the telegrasm of vihich i enclose a copy, he has reported in this sense to His Majesty's Government.

Sir, In continuation of my tel^ram No.78 dated -file 1st June 1932 sent in reply to your No.309 dated the 31st May 1932. I have the honour to report that I called on His Excellency the Shaikh on 6th. June, and explained to him the proposal of His Majesty's Government with regard to the reaffirmation of the existing frontier between Iraq and Kuwait. 2. The Shaikh appeared surprised and somewhat startled that His Majesty's Government should see fit to raise a question which, to use his own words M had been settled long ago by His Majesty's Government, according to documents in his possession, and which if raised again, might easily encourage Iraq with her pseudo-Persian mentality, to think the opportunity too good to be missed of attacking a frontier line fixed by His Majesty^ Government, much in the same way as she haeLendeavoured to repudiate His Majesty's Government's decision and promises in the matter of the Date Gardens'. He nevertheless agreed to abide by His Majesty's Govemmoit^s wishes in the matter, if they were decided on this course^provided that Iraq was clearly given —2—-2- —3— given to understand that a reaffirmation of the existing frontier only ^was contemplated^ 3 # &amp;s regards tlie proposal contained in para- / % 'y' C 'Y *''■ graph 5 of Colonial Office's letter Ko.P.Z,2828/32 dated iiie 11th May 1932 to the India Office - His Excellency, as I thou^it he would, at once objected to ttie suggestion that the Iraq Prime Minister should have any direct communication with him. He insisted that the channel of all correspondence should be through His Excellency ihe Hi^i Commissioner and yourself* He had too much cause he said to fear the Iraq Govemmen t, and asked that not only in the present case, but in all future matters, he should not be asked ever to hold direct communi cation with the Iraq G-overnment # 4o The Shaikh went on to recapitulate the many bitter experiences which his grandfather Shaikh Mubarak had had with the Turkish Grovernment, who had attacked him in exactly similar ways to those which the Iraq G-overnment were now employing, namely in the matter of the Date Gardens, frontiers, suzerainty, his Fidaghiyah Estate near Basrah^and the demand for a representative in Kuwait etc. etc. 5. These attacks which his grandfather had had to withstand alone, drove Mubarak to his death, and left an unforgetable scar on the minds of the people and ruling family of Kuwait. Today by God 1 s grace^he^Sha ikh Ahmad looked upon himself as part of the British Empire, and so was entitled to ask His Majesty's Government to figbt his battles for him. This he would always require, and for this reason desired to have no direct communication ever with the Iraq GovernMnt. 6. In explanation of the Shaikh*s above views, I migtit mention for the information of yourself and of His Majesty's Government that His Excellency and all his people, firmly believe that when Iraq gets her final independence and Joins the League of Nations, she will become Turkish in spirit if not in actual fact.The Shaikh of course has always held these views, maintaining that it is not possible for 90fo of her officials who all served the Turks and were brought up in their school^ of thou^it, to 'change their spots n . that on 5th June, the Iraq frontier police post at Safwan removed the large sign board, which was erected some 9 years ago by the Shaikh of Kuwait and Lieutenant-Colonel More, to show where the Basrah - Kuwait road crossed the actual fron tier immediately South of Safwan. I saw Hie board myself at the police post, and to my enquiries as to why it was removed, was told that it was by Baghdad^ orders conveyed through the Commandant of Police at Basrah. correspondence between myself and the Administrative Inspectoi Basrah, and may of course be due to a misunderstanding only, but it is curious that it should happen now. 7.
