The correspondence within the file is between His Majesty's Minister at Jedda; Alan Trott, His Majesty's Ambassador at Jedda; the Political Agent at Bahrain; the Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government; the Political Agent at Kuwait; and the Government of Pakistan, Karachi.The correspondence of 1945 (ff 2-5) concerns permission for an aeroplane to visit Bahrain to collect Seifal Islam Abdullah (Sayf al-Islām ‘Abdullāh) who was due to arrive from Iraq on 4 December 1945, and the cancellation of this arrangement due to him proceeding from Damascus instead. The correspondence of 1947 (f 6) concerns the issuing of visas to Aramco Americans and the decision to give blanket clearance to Aramco planes registered in Ethiopia so as to obtain the benefits of the Chicago Convention (but not to Saudi Arabian planes, unless Saudi Arabia is prepared to give reciprocal rights to Kuwaiti and British aircraft).
