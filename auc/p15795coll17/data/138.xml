At the time of the interview he was considered AUC’s oldest living alumnus, at age 85. He tells of attending AUC from 1938 as a secondary school student in its government curriculum course, later joining AUC as an undergraduate. He characterizes AUC as a small campus where “everybody knew everybody at least by name or by face from the president, Dr. Watson, till the hall porter,” and speaks of Watson’s approach to education. Philistin describes the journalism faculty and curriculum (including guest lectures by newspaper editors) in the early 1940s, and his role as Campus Caravan student newspaper editor, which involved dealing with censorship authorities as wartime restrictions were in place. He offers other glimpses of life at AUC during World War II, like emergency training on campus and precautions at home, interactions with a pacifist professor, students’ apolitical stance on the war, and the female classmate who had to withdraw upon the execution of her father, a French Vichy regime official. Philistin recalls the diverse ethnicities represented in the student body, interactions between those of different religions, and coeducation with female students (the latter a challenge for him as he came from a conservative background), as well as the efforts of AUC administrators and faculty to encourage mixing among students through social and recreational activities. He also tells the story of a lecture by feminist write May Ziade that he attended at Ewart Hall. Philistin outlines his career after graduating from AUC, with circulation and then editorial and foreign desk positions at Cairo newspapers until he was arrested and forced out of the business with the coming of the 1952 revolution. He tells of reporting a story in 1951 about an early plan, by a foreigner, for a dam where the Aswan High Dam was later built. From there he went on to work in public relations, applying translation skills he developed at AUC, with foreign oil companies in Cairo (Aramco’s office, shut by the Nasser government) and Libya (where he was deported by Gaddafi’s regime); he later worked for Iranian embassy. During his newspaper and public relations career he taught journalism at AUC, from 1948 to 1957, leaving as he became disillusioned with journalism in the absence of a free press and as AUC phased out the program. He also recounts the part he played in the 1960s in the continued publishing of AUC’s Journal of Modern Education.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
