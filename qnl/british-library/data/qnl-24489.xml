Part I.- GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—'OMAN-MUSCAT coast. The Report has been drawn up by Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A. S. G. Jayakar, and forms Part II of this compilation. Greater tranquillity has marked the past year in this State than has been known for a considerable time. This is ascribed by the Political Agent to the withdrawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz, and to the loyal adherence of Shaikh Saleh- bin-Ali to the Sultan’s party. The Sultan held himself aloof for the most part from the quarrels of tribal Chiefs; where, however, he stepped forward he was in most cases successful in bringing about a reconciliation. The Political Agent’s report shows that, with the exception of a severe fight about the end of March 1891 between the Beni Omar and the Howasinah, in which a good many lives were lost, there has been less bloodshed amongst the tribes than usual. The caravan routes from Sharkiyyeh, which were closed to trade owing to the quarrels between the Sharkiyyeh and the Ghafri tribes in the Semail Valley, were re-opened in the year under report with material benefit to the export trade of Muscat. The fire in the Khaboorah bazar, resulting in heavy losses to British Indian subjects, mentioned in last year’s report, was found to be the work of incendiaries of the Howasinah tribe. His Highness promptly agreed to the finding of a committee assembled to assess the losses which were finally fixed at $12,739, and payments are being made in monthly instalments. His Highness intends recovering about two-thirds of this sum from the Howasinah, some of whom have been imprisoned. The export trade shews a large increase; there is, however, a falling off in imports as compared with the previous year. The ratifications of the new Commercial Treaty were exchanged at Muscat on the 20th February 1892. 2 .—'OMAN PIRATE COAST. The past year has been markedly free from disturbance, owing partly, perhaps, to fear of the coalition mentioned in last year’s report as having been6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL formed by some of the Chiefs, and partly, perhaps, to the length and productive ness of the pearl fishery season. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah opened a custom-house for the taxation of imports in June 1891. The Chief of Um-ul-Kawain being unable to obtain satisfaction for the claims of his followers, threatened to march against Ras-ul-Khaimah; its Chief, however, besought the aid of his kinsman of Shargah, and thus warded off an attack. In the early part of the year the Chief of Um-ul-Kawain showed some signs of indifference to his engagements with the British Government, but on a reference being made to him through the Residency Agent, he acknowledged and promised to fulfil his obligations. Early in April 1891 Rashid-bin-Homaid, the Chief of Amjan, died. Inter ference was threatened by both the Um-ul-Kaiwain and Shargah Chiefs, the former of whom wished to see his son-in-law and the deceased’s brother, Abdul Aziz-bin-Homaid, in power in place of the son of Homaid, and the proposal was favoured by the Shargah Chief. It was however frustrated by Homaid’s form ing an alliance with the Chief of Debai and his succession was not further endangered. The British Government notified that as the Ceylon pearl fisheries were a failure, Arabs should not proceed there. All the Chiefs were warned, and but few of their dependents proceeded to Ceylon. Pearl diving commenced about the middle of May, or a little earlier than in the previous year, when the fishing was interrupted by “Ramzan ” falling after it had begun. The result of the fishing was more than usually remunerative, and each boat is said to have earned more than $1,000 per voyage. Through the good offices of the Residency Agent the Chief of Shargah remained on friendly terms with Debai. The headmen of the Al-Murrah, tired of the oppressive action of the Chief of Debai, went to Shargah with some 400 men and induced the Chief to receive them and to send a vessel to their divers, telling them ,to close the season at Shargah. The Debai Chief endeavoured through the Al Bu Falasha to per suade them to return, but they declined to do so. Before leaving Debai they begged the good offices of the Al-Bu-Ealasa in obtaining for them better treat ment by the Chief, but without any good result. The Agent is now endeavour ing to mediate a settlement of the claims of the Al-Murrah against Debai, and vice versa. In April 1891 the Chief of Abu Dhabi marched to Bereymi and was joined there by Hashir-bin-Maktoom from Debai with 300 camelmen and 30 horsemen. He then stormed and re-took the village of ’Ain from Saood-bin-Harar. Early in June the Shaikh proceeded on a visit to the Sultan of Muscat. The oppor tunity was taken to arrange a difficulty that had arisen owing to the omission of the Sultan’s Wali of Sohar to give the customary presents to certain visitors from the Beni Katab and Naim tribes. In former years under such circum stances these tribes would have invaded and plundered the country until their claims had'been satisfied. Owing, however, to the good offices of the Chief of Abu Dhabi, the Bedouins abstained from their usual course of action. Peace was established between the Chief of Abu Dhabi and the ’Al-Bu-Karuban sec tion of the Naim at Bereymi, and he married the daughter of the holder of that fort. All the Beni Ghafri tribes, including some hitherto considered as Jowa- simi, such as the Beni Katab and the Beni Kaab, are said to fight now under the Abu Dhabi flag. Two French merchants, Messrs. Chapuy and Tramier, made trips across the Gulf from Bundar Abbas to the ’Oman Coast, apparentlyRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 7 with the idea of buying mother-of-pearl and also, perhaps, of taking part in pearl diving, but the latter intention, if entertained, was not carried out. A M. Pierrepoiut, said to have been a former partner of Messrs. Chapuy and Tramier, also visited this coast, ostensibly to buy mother-of-pearl, but was com pelled by an attack of fever to proceed to Europe. The rainfall was very small at Shargah, and hence cattle suffered from want of pasturage. 3. —BAKU AIN. There has been no change in the Government of these islands. Influenza broke out in February, and several deaths occurred. Small-pox was prevalent and frequently fatal. In October 1891 a Mr. Strasburgner was sent out by an Anglo-French syndicate to report on the possibilities of the Persian Gulf pearl banks. He visited Bahrain and other ports with a view to obtaining information as to the methods, etc., of the Arab divers, but the result of his enquiries was not favour able to the introduction of European capital. In December 1891 the Shaikh gave a concession to a British firm at Bushire for the exclusive right to export shells, but withdrew it on the protest of the inhabitants and merchants of Bahrain on the understanding that it would not be re-granted elsewhere, and that the purchase and sale of shells should be free to all. The Chief, however, has imposed a heavy duty on the export of these shells, and it remains to be seen whether the trade can bear it. The date crop was excellent, and it was a good season on the pearl banks. 4. —EL-HASA. The new Mutasarif Said Pasha, who has twice before administered the district, arrived in May 1891. His policy is said to embrace the conciliation of the Bedouins, the restoration of their subsidies forfeited by his predecessor, and the removal of grievances previously allowed to pass unchecked. Arrangements have been made whereby the caravan route between El- Hasa and Ojair has become safe, and travellers free from molestation by Bedouins. Diarrhoea and influenza were rife during the year, and resulted in many deaths. 5. —EL-KA.T1F. Piracy, as carried on by the Beni Hajar in boats which they managed to surprise at anchor in various harbours and creeks, was very rife on these^shores within Turkish jurisdiction, and a general feeling of insecurity prevailed, which was not allayed by any vigorous action on the part of the Administration. In fact, not a single capture was effected at sea, and any success against these rob bers on land was obtained by Arabs under Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab. Great discontent was said to exist at El-Katif owing to the introduction of new laws by the Turkish Government regarding land tenures, the succession to estates, and probate duty. Small-pox was prevalent at El-Katif also. 6.—NEJO. Affairs in Nejd appear to have undergone a decisive change during the year under report, as the once powerful Ai-Saood family, who have hitherto maintained some hold on Nejd in spite of Mahomed Ibn Rashid’s constant attempts to dispossess them, seem now finally to have lost it.8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Early in 1891 Mahomed Ibn Rashid suffered a severe defeat at Kasim, the people of which espoused Abdur Rahman’s cause. In March 1891, however, having again assembled a powerful following, he attacked and defeated them ; the Chief of Aneiza and his headmen were killed, and the Chief of Boreyda taken prisoner, and eventually died of wounds received in the battle. Maho med Ibn Rashid thereupon appointed a Governor to rule the district in his name; and Abdur Rahman seeing things going against him retired to Bahrain for safety, leaving Nejd to Mahomed Ibn Rashid. In the meantime Mahomed Ibn Rashid’s Governor at Kharj, after looting a band of pilgrims from El-Hasa, was defeated and slain in an attack on a party of El-Ajman. Abdur Rahman seizing the opportunity of Mahomed Ibn Rashid’s return to Jabal Shammar advanced on Karj and Riadh, capturing both places, and his affairs took a more promising turn. His triumph was, however, short-lived, for he was very shortly afterwards surprised and totally defeated by Mahomed Ibn Rashid, and had to seek safety in flight together with all the remaining members of his family. He subsequently tried to obtain the support of the Turks at El-Hasa, and in this he has been partly successful, for the Wali has applied for a pension for him from the Turkish Government. The Al-Saood, who in the time of their prosperity numbered some four score men, are now reduced to less than a score of broken fugitives. Abdur Rahman has since been living a wandering life among the Bedouins of El-Hasa and Hatif, being always in fear of capture by Mahomed Ibn Rashid’s adherents. Mahomed Ibn Rashid by this victory seems to have broken the last opposition to his complete supremacy in Nejd, which it is said is now undisputed. 7—RL-KATR. Reports from El-Katr showed that Jasim-bin-Thani still persisted in his refusal to obey any directions of the Turkish authorities at El-Hasa. It was currently reported all along the Arab Coast that they intended sending troops to coerce him, but so far this idea has not been carried out. At the commence ment of the year a fight occurred between the Al-Ajan and the Al-Murrah, Beni Hajir. and Manasir, in which each party lost a few men. Some of the Beni Hajir seized a boat at Wakrah, and cut out six boats of the Al-Kubeisat, a tribe under Abu Dhabi, at the Island of Rarah, during the pearl season. Redress was sought by the owners from Jasim-bin-Thani, but he declared him self powerless to restrain the Beni Hajir. Early in this year a raid was made past, but at some distance from Abu Dhabi, by some of Jasim-bin-Thani’s men. They were pursued from Abu Dhabi but escaped. 8.—PERSIAN ALIARISTAN. The “ Shahab-ul-Mulk ” w T as confirmed in his post as Governor of Arabis- tan for another year from the nauruz. In May 1891 disturbances occurred amongst the Arab tribes near How- eizab, owing to the selection of an unpopular Governor for that place, the Beni Truf being the principal offenders. The Government sent troops to coerce the rebels, who were defeated in a sharp action outside Howeizah, and their Shaikh soon afterwards tendered his submission. These disturbances are now attributed to the intrigues of the Mustaufi or Treasurer of Arabistan, who was recently made a prisoner and sent in irons to Shushter. Arabistan generally was in an unsettled state, and the Anafijah Arabs under Shaikh Eerhan increased the feeling of insecurity by an attack on a caravan near Shushter in October last, in the course of which they carried off some rifles.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 9 The Shaikh eventually made his peace with the Government and matters soon quieted down. During the past year the British India Steam Navigation Company’s mail steamers commenced calling at Mohammerah, both on the up and the down voyages, their example being soon followed by other lines. Trade on the Karun has shown no signs of improvement, and in July 1891 Messrs. Lynch disconti nued running the Blosse Lynch, substituting for her a launch with a barge in tow. Through cargoes have lately been shipped from Bombay, and these may work a change for the better. The difficulties regarding accommodation at Ahwaz for goods temporarily stored there still exist. An arrangement between Messrs. Lynch and the Muin-ut-Tujjar, by which the latter was to build them convenient premises at Ahwaz is under discussion ; and although it will probably be considerably altered.in detail, if ever sanctioned by the Persian Gpvernment*, some practical result will, it is hoped, be reached before long as the outcome. A Persian post office was opened at Mohammerah in Pebruary last, and a British post office will be established in the Vice-Consulate as soon as that building is complete. It is hoped that it will be finished in July next, but difficulties, now surmounted, regarding the site and estimated cost hindered the progress of the work for several months. A line of telegraph from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, Dizful, and Shuster was completed in August lash year, and communication has been recently estab lished between Ahwaz and Bushire. An embargo was placed on the export of wheat from the Upper Karun districts but was subsequently withdrawn, as was also the embargo which had existed for some time on the Lower Karun. In January I paid a visit to Ahwaz, accompanied by Captain Kemball. His Excellency the Shahab-ul-Mulk received us with much cordiality, and discussed in a most friendly spirit the various questions which required attention. Prom Ahwaz we proceeded in the Shushan with Mr. Dicey, Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Busrah, and Messrs. Holland and Gaskin, the agents of the firm at Shustar and Ahwaz, as far up the Diz as she could be safely taken. This was her second trip, the first having been made in August last. Though navigable in high rises to within a comparatively short distance of Dizful, the river is too rapid and tortuous to be a safe or easy means of transport, and the surrounding country too sparsely populated to supply much trade, most of which must con tinue to find its way by land to Band-i-kir. Prom Shushter the land carriage is shorter, and the river Shateit above Band-i-Kir easier of navigation than the Diz, so that probably this will continue to be the main route. 9.—EARS AND PERSIAN COAST, It was the intention of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to visit Pars at the end of 1891, but owing to the prevailing scarcity which the presence of a large following would have increased, the idea was abandoned when prices began to fall. In Pebruary of this year the government of Pars was entrusted to His Royal Highness the Rukn-ul-Dowlah in place of His Royal Highness the Motamid-ud-Dowlah, who was recalled after administering the province for about five years. Haji Samsam-ul-Mulk was appointed Deputy Governor. His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk was replaced as Governor of Bushire by his brother the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, previously Governor of Arabistan, and proceeded to Teheran where he has since remained.10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Muhammed bin Abdullah bin Hasan was appointed the first Turkish Con sular Agent at Lingah. No changes of importance took place among the minor Governors of districts. In May 1891 the Il-Khani was placed in charge of the Kashkais, Darab Khan, the former Il-Begi, dying the following month. The Il-Khani did not long survive him, and died in January last; the headship has since been con ferred on Nasr-ullah Khan. It was supposed that the Government in. tended dividing the tribe into four sections and appointing a Ketkhoda for each, but this has not been done. Husein Khan Baharloo having escaped from the fort of Jerash whence he was imprisoned, began raiding the villages of Darab and Easa, many robberies being also committed near Shiraz by men of the Baharloo tribe. A force was sent against him from Shiraz, and a portion of it deserted to him, but he was eventually captured and taken to Shiraz, where he still is. In December 1891 a disturbance took place on board the British India Steam Navigation Company’s S.S. Kilwa from Bushire to Lingah, some Arab syces attacking the officers of the ship. She fortunately overtook H.M.S. Redbj'ea&amp;t, whose commander sent an armed party on board and removed the ringleaders who were afterwards tried at Bombay and punished. In January 1891 a bugalow owned by British ‘Indian subjects anchored near Kishm, the greater portion of the crew going ashore. During their absence $528 and $1,070 were stolen. The Persian authorities on receipt of a complaint suspected the Arab crew of a boat belonging to Hanriyeh on the pirate coast. They were arrested and sent to Bushire. After some delay the case was referred to the Shara Court at Lingah which acquitted the prisoners, so they were released and their property was returned to them. It was after wards asserted, apparently not without reason, that some of the crew of the bugalow were the thieves. In spite of an excellent harvest in the plain country the export of grain, from Ears and its ports was prohibited in June last, but all contracts entered into before the passing of the order were allowed to be carried out. An attempt was made by the customs farmer to levy ground rent on goods detained more than fifteen days in the custom-house, but it met with strenuous opposition from the merchants of Shiraz, and had to be abandoned. The prohibition against the importation of arms and ammunition into Persian territory was reiterated in July last, a large trade in rifles for sale in the interior having been apparently discovered by the Persian Government. The native merchants at Shiraz started an opposition to the Imperial Bank of Persia, but without any prejudicial effect on the Bank. Strong opposition having been manifested in various quarters, chiefly by the Mollahs, to the tobacco concession, it was withdrawn by the Persian Gov ernment in December 1891. In consequence of reports of cholera at Mecca, quarantine was imposed on arrivals from the Hedjaz and Yemen. A quarantine station was established, and cargo from Jedda was fumigated. Eortunately the epidemic did not visit Bushire. Influenza and small-pox were very prevalent in the island of Kishm, and many deaths occurred. Locusts have appeared in large numbers in Kirman and other parts. The crops in the plain districts have been very poor, and the price of grain has risen; it will probably do so much more, and the general outlook is gloomy.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 11 Early in the year representations were made by British Indian merchants at Meshed regarding the unsatisfactory manner in which customs fees were levied from them. They asserted that the 5 per cent, leviable by treaty did not suffice to clear their goods in transit through the interior, where they were sub jected to various local impositions up to a total of 8 or 9 per cent. Similar com plaints were received from the merchants at Bundar Abbas, where an attempt was made by the Governor of Bushire to introduce the treaty rate of 5 per cent, at the port of debarkation, instead of the old rule of paying 3| per cent, at the port and 1^ per cent, at destination. The effect of this, without special arrange ments with the various Governors en route, would have been to impose an extra 1J per cent. duty. The matter is now under discussion between Her Majesty’s Legation and the Persian Government, with a view to the prevention of further dues being levied up-country after payment of the authorized 5 per cent, at the port of debarkation. It is still undecided as numerous vested interests have to be considered before any uniform system can be introduced. His Imperial Majesty the Shah sanctioned the establishment of a tidal observatory at Bushire, and the necessary excavations are being made prepara tory to placing the instruments in position. 10.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. In July 1891 Mir Abdul Nabbi Khan, the headman of the Jask district, who has been responsible for the telegraph line in his district from Sadeck to Jask, commenced levying the tax on grain and date produce on the plea that he had not been paid his dues by the present farmers of the district. The Governor of Bushire thereupon sent the Naibs of Minab and Shamilah with 2,000 men to collect the revenue and to capture Abdul Nabbi, but they were • unsuccessful. In January 1892 Abdul Nabbi again obtained tbe control of the country round Jask from the Deputy Governor of Bundar Abbas. The holders at first refused to give up the district, and some desultory fighting occurred, but with no definite result. Locusts proved very destructive round Charbar and Geah in July 1891. Mir Abdulla Khan son of Sirdar Dilawar Khan having refused in August to pay the Persian Government taxes unless his father, who was imprisoned at Kerman, was released, a force marched against him but was beaten off. Ab dulla Khan then took post in a fort in Dizak whence he tried, but without suc cess, to obtain terms, the only Sirdar siding with him being Mir Path Maho med Khan, Sirdar of Bampusht. In September he was captured and sent to Dizak. 11.—SLAVE TRADE. No slave dhows were captured during the year by Her Majesty’s ships. Some reports of the importation of fresh slaves into Kishm were declared by the Governor of Bushire, after enquiry, to be without foundation. Information that several cargoes of slaves had passed up the Shat-ul-Arab for disposal in the Tillages along its banks and at Busrah was not confirmed on further enquiry. A dhow with twenty-nine negroes on board was detained at Eao by the Mudir, and they were sent to Busrah. The W ah, however, satisfied himself that they were not slaves, and they were allowed to return to the dhow. In the course of the year the Turkish Consular Agent at Lingah received from his Government a proclamation against slave traffic, issued m accorc anee with the Slave Trade Treaty between the British and Ottoman Governmen s, for publication amongst Turkish subjects at that port.

Abstract Table of Meteorological Observations for the year ending 31st March 1892 taken at the Residency Observatory, Rushire, 1891-92.Part II.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OE THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY AND CONSULATE POR THE YEAR 1891-92. The general political condition of ’Oman during the year now under report, Pol5tical which was one of continuous tranquillity, marred only occasionally by inter-tribal quarrels and blood feuds of a more or less important nature, contrasts strongly with the almost constant acts of rebellion and disquieting rumours of risings on the part of the Sharkiyyeh tribes against the ruling power, which used to occur in former years. The withdrawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz in the beginning of the previous official year from the sphere of ’Oman politics, and the loyal adherence of Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali to the cause of the present Sultan, have no doubt con tributed principally towards this peaceful state of affairs, almost unknown for many years in the annals of ’Oman. It is doubtful, however, if with this continued tranquillity of the province, the Sultan has improved or strength ened his position, for while the tribes of the Sharkiyyeh have all along held aloof from the central power at Muscat in the management of their own affairs, there are others which, though not actively opposed to it, have already shown indications of asserting their independence. The official year 1891-92 opened with rather a gloomy prospect for the trade of Muscat, on account of the caravan roads leading from the Sharkiyyeh having been closed by the coalition of the Ghafri tribes of the Semail Valley, and the diversion of trade from that part of the province to Soor. As men tioned in the last Administration Report, a large kafileh from the Sharkiyyeh had been attacked and plundered by the Ghafri tribes of the Semail Valley, principally the Beni Jahir, and as the offenders refused to surrender the plun dered property, both the parties assumed and maintained a hostile attitude towards each other for a long time, but the Sultan, who at first showed a cer tain amount of indifference as to the result of the quarrel, having been even tually prevailed upon to intervene by Shaikh Saleh of Al-Harth, who were the principal sufferers by the raid, sent Shaikh Rashid-bin-Aziz and Sayyid Muhammad-bin-Masowd as his representatives to negotiate an amicable settle ment between the several tribes concerned in the dispute. This intervention and negociation on the Sultan’s part resulted in an arrangement being made by which the Ghafri tribes were to pay the Harth $1,800 for all their losses, and had the desired effect of re-storing peace and reopening the roads from the Sharkiyyeh to Muscat for traffic. In connection with the fire at Khaboorah referred to in last year’s report which resulted in the loss of property belonging to several British subjects residing there, the Government of India having expressed an opinion that it was deliberately caused and held the Sultan primarily responsible for the pro tection of the property and persons of British subjects in His Highness s terri tory, and a committee having been appointed to enquire into the losses, it was decided that the sum of $12,739 was a fair estimate of compensation pay able to the sufferers. This amount the Sultan has agreed to pay m monthly instalments of $1,000 each, and the Government of India expressed their satisfaction at the readiness with which His Highness accepted the award of the Punchayet. In order, however, to recover this indemnity from the Howa- sinah, the most influential tribe at Khaboorah, His Highness imprisoned four of their Shaikhs, two belonging to the Sawalim section, and two to the Hawa. mid. An arrangement was eventually effected with the piisoneis, ) v ue18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL the two sections of the tribe were to pay His Highness $ 8,739, and the Sawalim prisoners having paid their share of it, namely, half that sum, have been set at liberty, whilst the two Hawamid Shaikhs still continue to be in prison. Inter-tribal quarrels, resulting in many instances in open hostilities, are of almost constant occurrence in ’Oman. Several of them took place during the year. The first, and judging by its result the most serious one, occurred about the close of the last official year, when the Beni Omar tribe having attacked the Howasinah near Khaboorah, were repulsed with a loss of 170 killed, and 20 taken as prisoners, the latter losing only 16 killed. This was followed by hostilities between the two sections of Al-Naerm tribe of Dank and Berevmi, and subsequently between the Beni Alee, the N’asem, and the Beni Kelban tribes of the Dahireh, in which several men were reported to have been killed. The only other quarrel of any importance was between the Beni Shikeil and and Beni Hina tribes of ’Oman Proper, which, arising from the simple cause of Shaikh Hilal bin, Zahir of the latter, attempting to erect a fortified building over a piece of land purchased by him from the Beni Shikeil, threatened at one time to assume a very serious aspect; but through the friendly mediation of a Shaikh of the Abrieen, the two tribes have now amicably settled the difference between them. In the month of July an affray took place between the Khojas of Matrah, many of whom are British subjects, and some Arabs at Gala, which place the Khojas are in the habit of visiting in the hot season. The dispute seems to have arisen at first over the hire of a donkey, but the general affray which resulted from it might have ended more seriously had not the Wazir Sayyid Muham mad bin Azzan, who happened to be living at Boshar then, intervened in time and effected a reconciliation between the parties. A threatening letter, however, w T as sent by some Arabs near Ziki some months afterwards to the principal Khojas with regard to a claim they had on account of the death of a slave belonging to them, which they alleged w r as due to injuries received during this affray, but on a proper representation having been made to the Sultan, His Highness gave the Khojas every assurance and promised to take steps to pre vent any further complication. The Sultan’s younger brother, Sayyid Fahad, proceeded to Zanzibar in the month of November for the purpose of marrying one of the daughters of the late Sayyid Bargash bin Saeed, and returned wfith his young wife about the end of March. The Besident visited Muscat in the month of February for the purpose of ratifying and exchanging the new 7 Commercial Treaty with the Sultan. He arrived here on the 19th in Her Majesty’s I. M. S. Lawrence, and left in her on the 21st. Slave Trade. There were no seizures of slave dhows during the year. The number of fugitive slaves that sought protection during the year at this Consulate was 71. Of these 54 were liberated under the Treaty stipulations of 1873, and 17 dismissed. Colonel E. Mockler held charge of the office of Political Agent and Consul from 1st April to 13th October, when he proceeded to Bagdad to officiate as 'Resi dent, and was relieved by Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A. S. G. Jayakar, who held charge from that date to the close of the year under report. A. S. G. JAYAKAR, Surgn.-Lt.-Col, In charge Political Agency, Muscat. Official changes.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 19 Part III.—REPORT ON THE TRADE OF SOUTHERN PERSIA AND THE PERSIAN GULF FOR THE YEAR 1891. During the past year trade did not diminish in volume, hut was not alto gether satisfactory to those engaged in it. The tendency to import goods in excess of the probable requirements of the country, to which attention was drawn in recent reports, was more marked than ever. Increased competition, pushed too far in the hope of driving rivals out of the field, resulted in re peated accumulations that could not be rapidly worked off, and in no little loss. More than one European firm suffered from failures amongst Persian mer chants, but these, whether caused by imprudent speculation or arising under more suspicious circumstances, were not extensive, and they have probably served to teach British firms a not unueeded caution in fixing the limits of the credit which they are prepared to allow to native dealers. At the time of writing this the prospects of profitable trade are far from bright. Owing to the recent decline in the value of silver, added to the glut caused by previous over-importation, large stocks of piece-goods up-country are unsaleable except at a heavy loss, nor does there seem to be any immediate hope of an improvement in exchange. Several steamers that usually load for the Persian Gulf have been taken off the line for the time being. Export business also appears likely to he much restricted for some time to come, as the usual embargo on the export of grain is not likely to remain altogether a dead letter this year, in which the crops in Southern Persia are very poor. Imports. Arms and Ammunition. — Strict orders prohibiting the importation of these in any form were issued by the Persian Government, hut were not probably enforced with much strictness, as no corresponding reduction was made in the demand from the customs farmer. Candles. —The business done in this article was normal, hut is said to be hardly remunerative. Cotton Goods. —Demand was brisk for the first quarter of the year, but slackened as time went on ; and by the end of the summer, owing to over-im portation and a rise in exchange, business had become unprofitable, continuing so to the end in spite of a steadily falling home market. The smaller native dealers had been a good deal crippled by the adverse exchange of the previous year, and some failures occurred; bat, as stated above, none of great import ance. European firms however would do well to consider the question of credit to native traders who are not, apparently, very scrupulous in fulfilling their engagements, and are with difficulty brought to account when they have evaded them. Glass and Glassicare. —The trade in these articles, the latter of which mostly comes from Austria, steadily increased during the year. Gold Lace and Thread.- —The demand fell off. This is said to be due to the importation of inferior kinds from France, whereby superior qualities from Germany are driven out of the market. Metals. —The trade in copper was dull, and only such quantities as were actually needed were bought. Iron, on the other hand, both rod and bar, was largely imported from India as well as from Europe. Large stocks were still c220 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL on hand at the close of the year, and could not be disposed of profitably at market rates. Sugar .—The market in loaf sugar was overstocked at the beginning of the year, as the result of the large imports of 1890 and shipments were in conse quence restricted. Rates improved in the summer, and after a temporary fall recovered again at the close of the year, when they were fairly remunerative. The bulk of this sugar, comes from Marseilles, and German loaf sugar now finds no market here. In soft sugar the importations from Europe were smaller than usual. The Mauritius supplies the greater portion, and it is received, shipped through Bombay, in better condition than that from London. Tea .—A taste for Indian in preference to Java tea has sprung up, and though Java tea, which replaced China varieties some time ago was still im ported, there was a still greater demand from Calcutta. Exports. The wheat and barley crops in the south of Persia were excellent, although owing to the rain ceasing early in the season, the grain was smaller than usual. The export was large and continuous, and probably exceeded that of any pre vious year. Shipments were made both to London and to Indian ports, where remunerative prices were obtained in consequence of short crops in Europe and the enhanced value of sterling, even in spite of the large quantities of grain offered for sale. Eventually, however, rates fell, and the Jews, who were then the chief exporters, lost considerably. The export of cereals has been steadily increasing of late years, showing that the area of cultivation must be also widening. The usual embargo was placed on the export of grain—shipment only permitted on the payment of special fees. As remarked earlier in this report, it is not improbable that this embargo may be enforced this year, both because the crops are not good, and also because the administration of Ears has passed into other hands and different views may prevail. Cotton .—Persian cotton, owing to false packing, imperfect cleaning, etc., is not in high repute in the London and Liverpool markets, and the year's transactions were hampered by low prices both in India and in Europe. The crop itself may be profitable to the grower, but is not so to the exporter who buys from him, considering the risk to which he is exposed of a constantly fluctuating market. There are considerable stocks now on hand, and these will have to be shipped in order to realise, even if there is but little improvement in prices. Opium .—The opium crop was unusually large, but owing to the persistent fall of prices in China, speculators were heavy losers. The scale of shipment* however, varied very little, being slightly larger to London where it is usually sent by European firms for use in the preparation of morphia, and smaller to China. The fall in prices has been as marked as it has been rapid. Only two or three years ago shippers could obtain $500 a chest in China, and £11 a pound in London. Kow the prices obtainable are $350 and 7s. 6d. respec tively; and as this article has been often exported to the extent of 7,000 chests, it is obvious how many interests are affected by these fluctuations in value. Wool .—This is generally exported by Persians, and is sent first to Bussorah where there are facilities for cleaning, sorting, and pressing it,' it is not highly thought of, and the trade in it is said not to be profitable. Most of the wool goes to London, and a fair amount was shipped, but prices did not encourage exporters.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 21 Tobacco .—The monopoly obtained by the “ Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia, Limited,” last year, was withdrawn by the Persian Government this year, and export on account of private firms is again allowed. It is understood that the exclusive right to import Persian tobacco into Turkey, where it is mostly consumed, has been given to a “ Societe du Tombac,” and it remains to be seen whether shippers will be able to export on favorable terms. Almond kernels .—A considerable trade was done in this article during the early part of the year, but large crops in Europe sent prices down, and the exports from Persia ceased to be profitable. Gum .—This was exported in fair quantities, chiefly by Persians, and fetched good prices. Woollen goods.—Carpets from Sultanabad are now exported by the Bagh dad and Bussorah route as being,cheaper. Freights .—Freights varied from 27s. 6c?. per ton in the spring to 36s. in . October, and closed at 30s. after an intermediate fall to 25s. The demand for tonnage to London was steady, and a much larger number of steamers than usual loaded from the Gulf. Tonnage for India was also freely taken up, whilst grain shipments were active, but fell off afterwards, and the state of the Bombay market does not encourage the hope that there will be much enquiry for it at present. Exchange .—Exchange was not so unstable as it had been in 1890, until quite the close of the year, when there was a sudden marked rise from krans 34 j to krans 38, and it has since risen still further, completely checking imports and increasing the difficulty of working off existing stocks. Minerals.—The boring for petroleum at Daliki has been continued during the working months of the past year, and a depth of 620 feet was reached. The work progressed more slowly than before owing to blocks in the bore-hole, but the engineer has now reached a depth of 1,000 feet, and the indications of oil are said to be more favourable. Work has been stopped as usual during the summer. A leading American firm having retired from Busrah, the importation of kerosine oil from America ceased, and Russian oil from Batoum was im ported direct by steamer. A. C.

The statistics of trade for the year under report, as furnished by the customs farmer, are shown in the accompanying returns, which are merely approximate, and therefore not entirely reliable, particularly in tbe case of exports. The returns show an increase of $150,000 in exports, and a considerable decrease of $120,000 in imports from India, as compared with the figures for the previous year. In the case of exports, dates and cotton fabrics contributed principally towards the increase; there was also an increase of $100,000 in specie exported to India, which was due to a rise in exchange for dollars in Bombay. In the case of imports the decrease was chiefly in rice, sugar, cloth, etc. There was a slight increase under the heads of imports from South Arabia and Africa in cotton, fowling-pieces, etc., showing an improvement of over $30,000. The customs were farmed by Sett Rattansee Parshotan for $115,000. A. S. G. JAYAKAR, Surgn.-Lt.-Col., In charge Political Agency&gt; Muscat.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 49 Part V. REPORT ON THE TRADE OE MOHAMMERAH EOR THE YEAR 1891. Trade. During 1891 there was an increase of shipments of wheat from Moham- merah; hut a large amount of the Karun produce was conveyed to Bussorali (wheat, harley, and wool) of which no account is obtainable. The oil-seed crop appears to have been exported by the Jerrahi river. By native craft a large amount of dates were exported to India and about a hundred tons were packed in boxes and sent to Bussorah. Only statistics of articles imported and exported by vessels under the British flag are obtainable; in addition some seven hundred cases of Batoum kerosine oil canie from Bussorah by “ hillam ” (canoe), and some miscellaneous articles for petty traders by coasting boats from Bushire. In October the Persian Government arranged that goods imported by sea going steamers should be transhipped to the river steamers in bond and arrange, ments have been made for issue of through bills of lading to the ports on the Karun by the companies whose steamers call at Mohammerrah. Of the imports about one quarter is consumed locally; the remainder is about equally divided between Dizful (with places beyond) by caravan, Shustar by steamer, and Koweit by native coasting craft. The town contains about two hundred and fifty shops of all sorts,'of which the average monthly consumption is as follows:— ; Khuzistan Produce. s. d. Rice, 7 h tons at 5 6'),..., Wheat, 15 tons at 4 6 J a hundredwei ^ t - Tobacco cwt. Silk cloth, 500 yards at . . , . 1 a yard. Linen for women's head-dress; 2,000 yards at . 5 6 per 7 yards. Imported Goods. Piece goods 60 bales. These are chiefly cheap kinds of Manchester shirting selling at about 6s. Sd. a piece, and chintzes at 7s. 3d. and kerchiefs for Arab head-dress. &amp; s d. French loaf sugar, 12 cases at . . . 1 13 4') -r. , -i i « „ r a case. Batoum oil, 60 cases at . . . . 0 6 0 J The exports of specie are large and no business in bills is done locally; there is therefore no rate of exchange with Great Britain. The accompanying returns are calculated at 36 krans to the pound sterling. The Indian rupee is current at two-and-a-half krans, and the Turkish lira at rates varying from thirty-and-a-half to thirty-three krans. Tables of principal articles of import and export are attached. Shipping. The British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers called weekly with mails and cargo, both on the way up and down the Shat-el-Arab. The Bombay and Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company’s steamers called on a50 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL way down only for the first five months, but since early in June both ways about once in three weeks. Direct steamers from Europe called on way up river on three occasions and on way out of river on two occasions, but grain was sent outside the bar of the Shat-el-Arab in lighters for shipment. Coasting vessels from neighbouring Persian ports and from Koweit called frequently, and during the date shipping season many native craft from India, Muscat, Zanzibar, and Arab ports called. No returns available of vessels not under British colours. The Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company run a steamer fortnightly to Bunder Naseri (Ahwas) on the Karun, in connection with a Persian steamer running thence to Shush ter. The Governor of Mohammerah also runs a fortnightly steamer to the same port in connection with the Naseri Company at Ahwaz. The native steamers carry about four-fifths of the cargo, in spite‘of greater advantages offered by British vessels. There are about sixty passengers each way monthly, the majority of whom travel by British steamers. Agriculture. The wheat crop on Karun was fairly good, giving a return of about fiity fold on amount sown. The date crop was light in weight from having been cut too early. The export of wheat from the Upper Karun was prohibited m July an from Mohammerah in November. Population. The population of Mohammerah is about 2,300. The merchants and tradesmen are principally Persians. The cultivators are all Arabs. Public Works. The telegraph line was completed to Bunder Naseri on the 1st August, opening communication with Shushtar and Dizful. A line is now being constructed from Bushire to Bander Naseri via Behbehan. At Bander Naseri the Naseri Company completed their tramway and goods are conveyed by it to and from steamers above rapids from and to steamers below rapids. General.
