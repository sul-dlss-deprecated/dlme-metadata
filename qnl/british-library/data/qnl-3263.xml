Sir* 'Vy I have the honour to report that His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Zahidan has forwarded to me a complaint from the Indian inhabitants of that place in regard to increases of Municipal taxation. Ihe situation at Zahidan is perhaps unique in Persia inasmuch as the majority of the shop- owners within Municipal limits are Indians* so that taxation falls more on them than on any other class, while they have no voice in Municipal affairs. The taxes hitherto paid are 1. Alcohol tax- Kr&amp;ns o per bottle. 2. Ghee tax Krans 3 per three-gallon tin. 3. Drugs oc Assafoetida Krans 10 per Indian Maund of 80 lbs 4. Shop tax Krans 3 per mensem. The Municipality have now raised the shop tax to Krans 10 per mensem. The contention of the Indian traders is that trie re appears to be no limit to the taxes which can be raised by the Municipality which oeyond the supply of a very few lights in the Bazaar undertakes no public works of benifit- particularly is there no proper sanitation. As far as can be ascertained the taxes collected go to augment the insufficient salaries of some of the local Officials who administer the funds. A copy of this despatch is oeing forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. 1 have,e tc., Sd/- C.K.Daly, Major, H.M.Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Sir, X have the honour to transmit to you herewith the reply I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to my Note on the subject of municipal taxation, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch Ho. 597 of December 16th lest. iow that Persia has been conceded tariff autonomy no one contests the right of the Persian aovernment to levy Xresh taxes on foreign goods, as M|ng as the local products are taxed equally, but in this particular case the Road Tax Law would seem to have been definitely violated, however much the Ministry fo&gt; Foreign Affairs may seek to explain the fact away. Moreover, dealers in alcoholic drinks are unanimous in declaring that the new taxes are seriously affecting coniuaption. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its ereloouxes, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq. I have, etc., (Signed) R.C.Parr.

Dated Bahman 7th 1209 (Janiuiry g?th, 1931) Ho. 30272/81061*. Monciear le 0herg4 d’Affaires, In reply to your note No. 431 in connection with municipal taxes levied on drinks, I have the honour to draw your attention to the following points As regards the statement made to the effect that the taxes in question cannot he reconciled with the remark 3 of article 1 of the law of Bahman 19th, 1304, I have to call your attention to the fact that no other taxes are, except the roed-tax, levied on loads of merchandise at the time of transportation of the same on the ads and in towns. You will therefore admit that municipal taxes which have been imposed on the drinks consumption have not any relation with the tax which is levied on goods at the time of transport ation of the same. The part of your note, in which an allusion was made to previous taxation, the nature of road-tax and the details of the case, h; s someivhet astonished me since, apart from the fact that the question of internal taxes is one which is merely governed by laws and regulations of the country, the question of enactment of the taxes in question has been disposed of in such a manner that it was not anticipated that there would remain any grounds for anxiety on your part. The municipal taxes on drinks ere being levied without exception on alcoholic drinks consumed in the country no matter whether they are imported from abroad or have been manufactured in Persia. You will, therefore, see that in enacting the taxes in question0 ^ueetion the considerations which are usually being taken into view in such cases for the encouragement of national (horae-mede) products have not been observed and that there was no intention of placing any obstacles in the ^ay of the trade of foreign made drinks. There aeema to be no grourd for anxiety for commercial institutions in thinking that the anticipated serious effect of the municipal taxation *ould lead to diminution in the consumption of the products in (iuestion since their customers ©re chiefly well-off people. As regards the question of the searching of the places where drinks can be found, I should assure you that emphatic instructions have been issued to the competent authorities to the effect that they should not cause undue trouble to the persona concerned. I avail myself of this opportunity, etc. (Signed) Ferough!.indexed /**\ In any further communication on this subject .please quote and address —not to any person by name, but to— ' “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) C. W. BAXTER. The Secretary to the Board of Trade#iritisii Le^tition, Sir, IlitJi reference to Sir Robert Clire , » deapatcb Ro* E44 of June 3rd last, X hare the honour to inform you that the Ministry of the Interior is gradually sanctioning the lery by the municipalities of new taxes intended to compensate them for the loss of revenue from the road taxes which they recently suffered. At first a heavy tax on motor spirit and kerosene was freely spoken of but the idea was abandoned, perhaps for fear of antagonising the Russians. It was apparently the .Isfahan Municipality that first suggested an octroi on alcoholic drinks entering the towns, and this proposal seems to have been generally adopted in conjunction with an increase in the tax on houses and other buildings, including places of entertain ment. I enclose an extract from the Messager de Tdhdran which gives a list of the new taxes, other than those on house property, which are being collected by the Tehran Municipality. Generally speaking the provincial municipalities are collecting similar taxes but on a smaller scale. £• The French Legation has shown signs of being greatly perturbed by the tax on alcoholic drinks, which must seriously affect the demand for French wines in particular, and Monsieur Maugras has invited various /other The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.T., The foreign Office.othar Legations to maJte representation* similar to hie own to the Persian Gavernment^ I attach in this connection a copy of the note he addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and also a schedule prepared by the French Legation which shows how formidable these taxes are when added to the existing customs duties and road taxes. 3. Various considerations led me to enter a protest with the Persian Government 2 the danger of these municipal taxes heralding the approach of others; the inadvisability of introducing fresh taxation at a time when the trade of the country is already at a very low ebb; and lastly the guarantees given to this Legation in 1928 9 when the Hoad Tax Law was being evolved, and actually incorporated in that law. 4. X attach a copy of the note which I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on November 29th and which I trust may meet with your approval. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty^ High Commissioner for •Iraq. I have &amp;c., (Signed) R.C. Farr.British Legation, Tshr&amp;n, KoTsmbsr ^Vth, 1930 Monsieur le Ministre, There are various aspects of the taxes which the Council of Ministers has authorised the Tehran Municipality the town to which X beg to invite four Highness 1 kind attention* 2. In the first place I have difficulty in reconciling these new taxes with the forml assurance, contained in Note 3 to Article 1 of the Road Tax law of the bth February 1926 and couched in quite unequivocal toms, it seems to me, that goods having once paid the new road taxes would not be subject to any other tax whatsoever on entering the towns* 3« This guarantee in fact constituted one of the conditions subject to which His Majesty's (rovernment agreed to the introduction of the road tax - a tax which was intended to replace, and did in fact replace, a multitude of taxes levied on goods from the time they had paid customs dues to the moment they reached their destination and which had never been recognised by my Government as legal* I would in this connection refer Your Highness to the following extract from a letter - as well as certain provincial municipalities, I understand - to levy on alcoholic drinks of foreign origin entering /written His Highness i mgnness Mirza Mohamad Ali Khan Feroughi Minister for Foreign Affairs*/ 6 * written by Sir i^eroy Lorain* to His Excellency iiaccan JOian Muchar, then ^inieter for foreign Affaire, cm ^ the &lt;£4th Woveraber, 192® 'They (Hie Majesty's Uovernwent) have therefore, 'after careful and aytupathetio consideration of the project 'under discussion, authorised tae to infora four Excellency, 'and I have great pleasure in doing so, that they are 'willing to egree for their pert to the application of 'the proposed compounded road tax, if the Persian 'Government will give their favourable attention to the 'following consideration 'a) that the existing transport taxes which 'it is the intention of the Persian Government to 'eupersede by thie compounded road tax shall be 'definitely abolished and that no taxes of a similar 'nature will be levied on foreign merchandise in the 'future, whether In the shape of a reformed municipal 'taxation or any other.' - etcetera.- 4. Secondly, the level Of these taxes Is of a nature to cause grave concern to the commercial interests affacted, particularly in view of the fact that the trade of the country is at present traversing an extremely serious crisis, as four Highness is well aware. In fact it would not be surprising If they resulted in an appreciable reduction in the imports of these commodities, thereby injuring the major financial interests of the Persian Government. 5. I would also remind four Hi, one as that at the time of the signature of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, His Excellency fcakrevan, in a letter dated 10th May,1928, pointed out to Sir Hobert olive, in reply to the latter’s request for an assurance that the road taxes would not be Increased, that the Persian Government being itself Interested in the development of its trade it would be Illogical for the Government to Impede such development by imposing unnecessarily high charges upon it.6. Lastly, I may be permitted to express tho hope that the laimioipal authorities do not propose, as might he inferred from various notices published in the press recently, to search the business premises of British firms dealing in alcoholic drinJcs to maice sure that bandsrolies have been affixed thereto without an order emanating from the competent judicial authority, unless such search be freely sanctioned by the firm concerned. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to four Highness the assurance of my highest consideration. (Signed) H* C. JfABR.January 1 Sir, I duly reoaivdd your fleapatch No* 59t of the 16th i&gt;ecember f and I approve your aotlon in addressing representations to the s'ersian Government regarding the Bamicipal taxee on aleoholio drinks of foreign origin recently authorised by them. 2* 1 desire, ho* ever, to rexuind you that from a strictly legal point of view no ground exists for a protest against the levying of these taxes, provided that this action does not involve an infraction of Article 3 of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th i£ay, 19£6* 3. It is true that the imposition of the taxes in question is in contradiction with Note 3 to Article 1 of the Persian Bead Tax Law of the 8th February, 1986, and that this note was appended to the law to satisfy one of the condi tions laid down by His Kajesty f s Government in /givinggiving t&amp;eir oonsssnt to this onaotmnnt* In viow of the faot # howovor, thi t Tariff Autono^gr since been oonoeded to ir , er8is 9 the consent of His Majesty 1 s Govemmnt to saeasures such as the Koaa Tax Law is no longer required. and it eannot be contended that the undertaking of 1926 is still binding upon the xersian</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003c3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3410</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003c3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3410</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/14 ‘Persia; Municipal Taxation in’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1931</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-01-12T10:39:22</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (35 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 36; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-34; these numbers are also written in pencil and circled, but are crossed through.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Copies of correspondence exchanged between British officials (the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, and the British Consulate at Sistan and Kain [Ka’īn]), and between Raymond Cecil Parr of the British Legation at Tehran, and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi, concerning the imposition of taxes in Persia [Iran] upon certain imported goods, notably imported alcoholic products.
