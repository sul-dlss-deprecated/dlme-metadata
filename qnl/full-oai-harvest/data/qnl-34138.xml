There are also two areas of Egypt which have been marked with striped coloured lines, the area west of Suez marked with red stripes, and an area east of Suez marked with purple stripes.There are also two coloured lines marked on the map, running primarily through Saudi Arabia. The 'Violet Line' line marks the boundary of Ottoman territory and the 'Blue Line' the boundary of the Sanjaq of Najd. These lines are both marked according to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, which was unratified.A key is located in the bottom right hand corner of the map and includes symbols for: producing oilfields, proven oilfields, pipelines, projected pipelines, existing refineries, and refineries under construction.</abstract><typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Map</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100080251898.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
