Subject* F.O. letter to the Treasury of 3rd Reorganisation of consular posts in Persia. September.K 9903/30^/23^ Ext #1 {j85Q/42« P0REK5J OFFICE, S.w.1. 33?d Septeniber, 1942. I am directed 'by Mr. Secretary Eden to state for the infoma.tion of the Lords 0ararra.ssioners of His jesty * s Treasury, that he has had under consideration the reorganisation of certain consular posts in Persia in order to meet the requirements of the present political situation in that country and to facilitate the task of the British military authorities there. 2. Mr. Eden considers that a career consulate should be opened at Disful, or some other town, near the headquarters of the 10th Amy, wliich are to be moved to IQiorraiaabad. It is proposed to appoint Mr. It G* Jakins, at present His Majesty*s Consul at Suez, to this post, which, it is hoped he win be available to open in October next. 3. Mr. Eden also wishes to raise the career vice-consulate at Isfahan, the re-opening of which was sanctioned in Treasury letter E 8404/2 of the 10th November, 1 941 5 to a. full consulate, and to create a post of a career vice-consul at Shiraz under the superintendence of His Majesty*s Consul there. 4. It has also became necessary to strengthen the staff at Ahwaz and His Majesty *s Minister at Tehran has proposed that an officer should be obtained fron the Government of India to take over His Majesty’s Consulate there. The GovernrAent of India have offered to provide a suitable man with a. good knowledge of Persian and Mr. Eden is anxious to accept this offer. Mr. Baillie, who is at present His Majesty’s c onsul at Ahwaz, would thus be freed for service elsewhere in Persia. 3. In these circumstances I am to express the hope that Their Lordships will be moved to authorise, subject to the acceptance by the Government of India of a moiety, the expenditure involved in the creation of a full consulate at Dizful, the elevation of the post at Isfahan to a full consulate and the appointment of a career vice-consul at Shiraz. 6. I am also to explain that the proposed appointment of an officer of the Indian Political Service at Ahwaz will involve a moiety of the resultant expenditure devolving on Imperial funds, and, in addition, one half of Mr. Baillie's remuneration will, pending his definite appointment elsewhere, likewise continue to be a charge on Imperial funds. In the absence of provision for these concurrent payments, I am to request Their Lordships * sanction for them, subject to the Government of India accepting liability for their share. 7. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office in the hope that Secretary of State for India will be able to accept, on behalf of the Government of India, a moiety of the expenditure involved. I am, etc., (Sgi.) A.B.
