Sir, I would invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Colonel Ross' letter No:254 1 dated 23rd August 1888,relative to the island of Sirri. It will be seen that the discission of the political status of this island.which arose in September 1887 &gt; was continued till August 1888,when,at the request of H.M's Minister at Tehran,it was postponed in order to facili tate the conclusion of the Hastadan negotiation,which was then in progress,and it does not appear to have been re sumed since. The British Agent at Shargah has recently reported that\at the Chief of Debai has addressed him regarding certain Arab subjects of Debai t who ,after receiving advances for pearl diving operationsthave absconded and taken refuge on the island and has solicited the assistance of this Residency in recovering these cUuns^ In view of the uncertainty existing regard ing the political status of Sirri,1 have the honour to request that I may be favoured y by the Government of IndiayWith instructions indicating how the matter should be dealt with* h I have the honour to be.

In continuation of correspondence ending with Mr. Conyngham Green's despatch No. 19, dated 16th November 1894, and in accordance with Your Excellency's telegraphic instructions, I have the honour to forward herewith a memorandum dealing with the reply of Persian Government to the note from Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires of 11th September 1894 in regard to the Island of Sirri. MEMORANDUM. In a reply dated 7th Jamad I 1312 (6th November 1894) to the note by Her Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires of 11th September 1894, the Persian Government has set forth certain arguments in support of its claim to the Island of Sirri. His Highness the Sadr Azam, basing the Persian claim to the island upon the constant exercise of jurisdiction even when Joasmee Sheikhs have not been Governors of Lingah, slates, ' for example when Saad-ul-Mulk * * * * abovementioned Island.' This must refer to the period when the administra tion of Lingah and Bunder Abbas having been separated from that of Fars- Saad-ul-Mulk (as Muhammad Hassan Khan) was appointed deputy for the administration under the Amin-es-Sultan. Saad-ul-Mulk held this charge from June 1883 to March 1884, or about 9 months, in which short period, proof of an alleged long established jurisdiction can hardly be found. And it was about the end of this period that Sheikh Yusuf, who was the actual Governor of Lingah from 1878 till his death in 1885, wrote on 1st Jamad II 1301 (29th March 1884) to the Chief of E-as-el-Khymah, fully admitting the possession of the Island of Tamb by the Joasmees. This possession was also admitted by Khalifah-bin-Saeed and All-bin-Khalifah, the predecessors of Sheikh Yusuf, as Chiefs or Governors* of Lingah. With regard to the allegation that Sheikh Yusuf farmed the revenues of Slrri from the Saad-ul-Mulk, I would observe that Sheikh Yusuf himself held the Governorship of Lingah for six or seven years, during which he would in natural course, according to the view of the British Government, be concerned with the administration of the Island on behalf of the Joasmees. The necessity for farming the Island revenues from the Saad-ul-Mulk towards the close of his period of authority is difficult to understand. Again the circumstances attending the assertion of Persian authority over the Island, and the mode In which it was effected in 1887, certainly do not point to a long established and well recognized possession, which had been effectively exercised by the lease of the revenues in years immediately pre- S E—79-85—Nov. 1Question of the status of the Island of Sirri. ceding. In September of 1887 an armed party with two small cannon was sent to erect a flagstaff and to hoist the Persian fla| on Sirri, and this proceeding certainly has not the appearance of an ordinary incident in the course of a long maintained possession. It has constantly been alleged on the part of the Persian Government that Persian possession has been quite independent of the Joasmees, who have held authority on the Persian coast; and that it has ;been exercised independ ently of them, but there has been no proof of these allegations. Thus the Amin-es-Sultan informed Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires in December 1887 that Sirri and Tamb had paid taxes to the Persian Government for nine years previously, and that documents in support of Persian claims were at Bushire. Yet the then Resident Colonel lloss was at once informed by the Malik-ut- Tujjar, who was Governor at Bushire at the time, that he had no such documents. The proofs of the former dependence of Sirri on Persian authority which were asked for by Her Majesty's Legation in March 1888, have also not been given. On the other hand, it is certain that the condition of the Joasmees on the Persian coast in past times was not that of ordinary subjects, nor were their Chiefs who heldT authority there, in the position of Governors such as are usually subordinate to a paramount power. Nearly 150 years ago they crossed over to aid Mulla Ali Shah, Governor of Ormuz and Bunder Abbas, against his sovereign, and took possession of Lingah and other places on the coast. In 1809 a British naval and military expedition against the Joasmees, after dealing with Has-el-Khymah, had to operate against them on the Persian coast, destroying their boats at Lingah and attacking Luft. Similar action was necessary again in 1819-20 when the co-operation of the Prince Governor of Shiraz was requested in the operations against Lingah, Mughu, Charak and Tawanah, which had completely identified themselves with the Joasmees, The military force was, after the expedition, stationed in Kishm, then a depend ency of Muscat. The conclusion from these historical facts is certainly not that the Joasmees having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived an authority over outlying islands, but rather that they carried with them to their new settlement a possession in the islands which they already possessed; and the fact that a section of these Arab intruders later acquired the status of Persian subjects, and held their authority on the coast in subordination to the Persian Government as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the tribes may have held in common.

Wilson , Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To-*-The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 63, dated 31st May 1895, I have the honour to report that the Island of Sirri continues to be used as a harbour of refuge by run-away debtors from Debai on the Arab coast. Some more pearl- divers from Debai are said to have recently absconded to that island, and the Chief of Debai has again addressed the Residency Agent on the Arab coast on the subject, and solicited the assistance of Government in recovering the debts due by the fugitives. I have instructed the Residency Agent at Lino-ah to communicate unofficially with the Deputy Governor of Lingah, and see 5 what can be done in the matter. It is, however, not improbable that I may receive further complaints of this nature from the Debai Chief, and I venture to hope that an early decision of the question of the status of the island will be arrived at, to enable me to deal satisfactorily with such cases in future 2Question of the status of the Island of Sirri.
