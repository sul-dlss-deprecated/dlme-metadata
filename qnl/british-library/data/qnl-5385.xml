If necessary a suit might be made in Meshed. But it is advisable to bring the Whole of one’s wardrobe complete on tne assumption that no additions can be made to it in ast Persia* The only material sold in the .town which the present vice Consul has found to be usable is cotton stuff for summer pyjamas* GiKKRAL CO-TT OF LrVCTQ . : ‘ r r • • . , . , (Present rate of exchange is.rou^ily Rupee 1/- Rials 10)* (a) FOOD .

If'the winter is dry, the garden produces virtually nothing* *&gt;- - „ The following stores are recommended* Visitors during my time have generally liked beer and whisky, and have appreciated Sparklets Soda water: with the addition perhaps of a gin and hitters* Persian vodka is obtainable in Meshed (present price Rials 26 per quart bottle) and the best white Shiraz wine (present price Rials 26) is pleasant* Persian beer is unobtainable at present except Tehran*Persian cigarettes (I am told, of a very smokeable quality) are obtainable at about Rials 10 per hundred. Bread (of the leavened loaf type) can be made from*wheat flour and leaven (Khamir), both / obtainable locally (though instructions for baking it are not known to Persians). Persian bread is of a flat unleavened type. The present Vice-Consul has relied entirely on tinned butter brought from India; though butter of an inferior quality can be made from cow^ milk locally. Tea is obtainable locally (present price about Rials 50 per lb). It is best brought from &lt; India. Coffee is obtainable in Meshed but is best brought from India. Tinned fruit (Persian manufacture) is obtainable in Meshed, but has been sometimes found to be unsafe. For touring purposes I have found the following essential or virtually so: tinned meat, vegetables, ‘soup, fruit, milk, butter and stores, of tea, coffee sugar etc. In other words the desert produce nothing (except perhaps salty water).
