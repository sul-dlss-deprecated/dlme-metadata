P.Z.6160/39 Department. r Please see the submission/at^P.Z.1158/39. The position with regard to the replacements for / which the Afghan Government originally asked is now as follows:- (1) 123 complete rifles have been supplied to the Afghans in replacement of those badly corroded. (2) With regard to the 39 rifle bolts^replacement of which is required ; we are still waiting to hear from the Afghans the M prefix letters” for which the War Office asked. (3) None of the articles listed in Appendix ”C” of the Military Attache's letter of 4th October 1938 (P.Z.8164/38) have yet been supplied. The War Office now want to know the 'prefix letters” of articles 3i 8 and 9 of Appendix 'C* before they can supply the replacements in question. Prom Sir K.Praser Tytler’s letter of 23rd Sept. 1939 (which crossed Foreign Office Despatch^of 6th Sept.), it now appears that the Afghans have produced 25 further rifles which they claim are in even worse condition than the 123 which have already been replaced. Sir K.Praser Tytler in this letter suggests the following measures C 6 . which the Afghan Government have agree d,as a means of helping to clear up the whole question of replacements. (l) So far as possible the components listed in Appendix ”C” of the Military Attache's letter of 4th October 1938 should be replaced by components taken from the 123 corroded rifles already replaced which are due for return to the War Office. A revised list of replacements which would still be required from England would then be prepared. (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd.

It seems likely that proposal ( 1 ) at any rate should go aorae- way to solve the difficulty of replacements meritionod in Appendix 'C” » since one would imagine that nearly all the replacements wanted, except the 1566 front'handguards f could be found from the 123 rifles. In any case the Minister is in the best position'to judge It is therefore submitted that we should write officially to the-War Office•supporting his proposals. Since the matter of settling the question quickly and satisfactorily is now of some political importance, and the proposals might possibly come into conflict with War Office routine regulations, it is suggested that a d.o. letter might be sent to the' Under Secretary at the War L- Office at the same time. Drafts submitted accordingly. ps * This presumably is what is meant tho’the wording in Sir K.Fraser Tytler’s letter is not quite clear.

The Afghan Govt, found that Attache at Kabul drew up lists of defective rifles and component parts, which the War Office subsequently agreed to replace free of charge# ta the- foilowing o f ‘f oct—: (1) 123 complete rifles badly corroded (2) 39 rifle bolts broken or badly corroded ( 3 ) a number of other defective miscellaneous components. A consignment of 123 rifles has recently been sent out to Afghanistan in place of those badly corroded, but replacement of items ( 2 ) and (3) has been considerably delayed owing to the difficulty of obtaining exact particulars from the Afghans Government, some of the 25,000 rifles arrived in an unsatisfactory condition, and in consultation with the British Military in/ (10337) Wt.l4054/P.164 10,000 5/39 A.&lt;&amp; E.W.Ltd.

Minister has now suggested that it would simplify matters if the replacements required under item (3) could he taken as far as possible from the 123 corroded rifles which have now been replaced and are due for return to England, and that replacements for 25 further rifles, which the Afghans have now produced and which appear to be in a condition no better than that of the 123 rifles already replaced, could be taken from the same source. Revised lists of components which would still be required from England would then be drawn up.

July, 1339. i The matter of replacing these damaged components and the return to England of the 123 corroded rifles for which replacements have now been received continues to give difficulty and despite several visits by the Military Attache to the Chief Ordnance Officer we still seem to be a long way from reaching any finality. Many difficulties have arisen owing to variations in nomenclature and your latest communications (forwarded under P.Z.4026/39 of 12th. July, 1939, even further complicates the question of these replacements. Another difficulty which has now arisen is that the Afghan Government have produced a further 25 rifles from the total consignment which tney claim are in even worse condition than the 123 rifles which have been replaced. The Military Attache has seen a number of this lot of 25 and those seen were certainly worse than many of the 123 due for return. In an examination which dealt with 25,000 rifles it is perhaps understandable that such might be the case. \ I imagine that the year of manufacture and the condition of the 123 rifles now due for return x^recludes any value being placed on them except possibly for “Drill purposes R.

It will be of course ensured that the 25 rifles now produced do actually form part of the total consignment of 25,000. ^ Owing to the possibility of accidents it is not considered advisable to interchange any of the bolts shown in Appendix , B’ to my Despatch No.154 dated 17th.

I have the honour to refer to your Despatch N o. 28 (N. 1177|3l97), dated the 13th March 1939, regardinar the replacement of certain defective rifles and com ponents supplied by His Majesty’s Government to the Afghan Government. 2. The question of the markings on the thirty-nine rifles and of the nomen clature of the components referred to in Lists A and B respectively of War Office letter No. 016416307 (M.G.O.-3), dated the 21st February 1939, has been discussed by the Military Attache with the Chief of the General Staff. Although there is a possibility that the thirty-nine rifles may have been issued to units and may not now be traceable, the Chief of the General Staff promised that he would endeavour to obtain details of the markings now required. 3. In regard to the discrepancies in nomenclature it would appear that this has arisen owing to the fact that the War Office designation of components applies to the modern pattern rifle whereas those mentioned in List B enclosed with War Office letter No. 016416307, dated the 21st February 1939 as ‘ India’s designation ’, apply, it would seem correctly, to the older pattern rifle as sold to the Afghan Government. I trust that no difficulty may now arise in the supply of their replacement components owing to the fact that the rifles are of old pattern, and in order to avoid any possible error would suggest that one each of tlm components to be replaced should be forwarded from here to the War Offi ce. This has been agreed to by the Chief of the General Staff and the components will be despatched to England as soon as they are handed over. 4. In view of the further delay which will now occur before the Afghan Gov ernment’s requirements can be fully met I consider it very desirable thait immediate arrangements should be made for the separate despatch of the 123 complete rifles. 5.

It will .he remembered that a preliminary inspection for major damage and defects in the 25,000 rifles supplied to the Afghan Government was carried out by the Military Attache' to the British Legation and by Afghan Ordnance Officers between February and November. 1937 (see Military Attache's report at P.Z.686/38) It was on the basis of this preliminary inspection that the Afghans made their complaint about 45 rifles seriously damaged out of the first batch of 9,000 and stated that, on completion of ^ detailed examination, they proposed to forward a claim for replacements of all deficiencies. In view of these complaints the offer was made by H.M.G. ,4^ last May (paragraph 3 of Forminka 36 of 5th May, 1938, in which the War Office agreed-) that, on receipt of full particulars’.verified by the British Military Attache' of the final claims of the Afghan Government, they would be willing to replace, without charge, damaged components or corroded rifles.to the extent necessary to give the Government of Afghanistan their full number of 25,000 rifles in a serviceable condition. The detailed examination of the 25,000 rifles by the Military Attache' and Afghan representatives has now been completed and H.M. Minister has forwarded Mi (Kabul despatch of 17th November at P.Z.8164/38) the Military Attache’s report of this inspection together with a copy of a letter from the Afghan Foreign Minister, asking for the replacement of the deficient rifles and component parts mentioned in the comprehensive li st/2 . / list drawn up 'by the Military Attache the Afghan re pre se nta t i ve s.

P z 3* Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Kabul, to H. M.’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 154, dated the 17th November 1938. In continuation of my despatch No. 2, dated the 4th January 1938 and with reference to paragraph 3 of your telegram of the 9th May 1938 (Forminka 36), I have the honour to forward as enclosures to this despatch the following documents :— (а) A letter dated the 4th October from the Military Attache to this Legation reporting the completion of the inspection of the 25,000 rifles supplied by His Majesty’s Government to the Afghan Government, together with lists giving details of all rifles, components, etc., for which replacements will probably be asked by the Afghan Government. (б) A letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated the 9th November, asking for the replacement of certain rifles and component parts. The lists for warded with this letter agree with the lists appended to the Military Attache’s letter referred to above. 2. Major Lancaster’s letter shows that the inspection was carefully carried out, and that the replacements now asked for are not excessive if the Afghan Govern ment is to receive the full number of rifles in a reasonable and serviceable condi tion. I trust therefore that His Majesty’s Government w T ill now be able to arrange for the early supply of the rifles and components mentioned in these lists. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India. (Enclosure a). Letter from the Military Attache, British Legation, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, dated the 4th October 1938. With reference to my letter dated 21st December 1937, I have the honour to report that the inspection of 25,000 -303 1914 pattern rifles supplied to the Afghan Government by His Majesty’s Government has now been completed. 2. The preliminary inspection for major defects and damage was completed in November 1937, but the detailed examination of rifles for which the Afghan Government propose to ask for replacement has been considerably delayed owing to :— (a) The necessity of cleaning the rifles before they could be examined in detail. (b) The disturbances in Katawaz and the Eastern Province which entailed the issue of those rifles found to have no serious defect, to conscripts recalled for service. (c) The pre-occupations of the Afghan Ordnance officers in checking and issuing artillery and machine guns purchased in Czecho-Slovakia. (d) The death in July 1938, of G. M. Muhammad Akram Khan, the Chief Ordnance Officer as the result of a bomb accident. 3. The new Chief Ordnance Officer, G. M. Abdul Ghafur Khan, and other Afghan representatives were very reasonable in their demands, and during the course of the somewhat lengthy examination of the rifles, relations were good. The Chief Ordnance Officer however pointed out that had they not been com pelled to issue a large number of rifles which were slightly rusted or corroded to reservists recalled for service in connection with the disturbances in 1937 and 1938, considerably larger demands for replacements would have been made. 4. I was assisted by Mr. Rees, the Legation Garage Superintendent in my examination of all rifles which were rusted or corroded. He is a trained engineer and was able to give me expert advice regarding the effect of the rust or corrosion in particular rifles or their components. 5. It should be noted that the majority of the rifles which were badly corroded came from five or six packing cases. These cases had obviously been affected by rain or sea water as the cases themselves were stained. When recommending a MC226EAD2 corroded rifle for exchange, due regard was paid to the possibility of exchanging the bolt or other parts of the rifle in lieu of the whole rifle. 1 his procedure reduced the total number of rifles for complete replacement, but increased the number of bolts, magazine covers, trigger guards, etc. for which the Afghan Government pro pose to ask for replacements. In no case has the replacement of a corroded rme r or part of a rifle been recommended unless in my opinion and that of Mr. Rees, the rifle or its component is so badly damaged as to affect its future serviceability. 6. All the rifles for which replacements are recommended bore one of the examiner’s marks shown in the list supplied by the War Office, London, forwarded to this Legation under covering letter No. 5C12 dated 1st September, 1937, from the India Office, London. 7. On the completion of the examination of the whole consignment of 25,000 rifles the separate lists of all defects and damages prepared by the Afghan ordnance authorities, and by me, were checked, and found to agree in every respect. The Afghan Chief Ordnance Officer then informed me that he would forward an official request through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to this Legation for the replace ment of all rifles, split woodwork, and defective or damaged components shown in the above lists. I suggested to him that he should if possible retain in store all the rifles and major components for which replacements would be requested so as to facilitate any necessary future examination, or an eventual exchange should His Majesty’s Government agree to their request. This he promised to do, but stated that in the case of split woodwork and other defective minor components this procedure could not be adopted as they wished to utilize as many of the rifles as possible. 8. In Appendix “ A ” attached to this report I have given a list of 123 rifles which are badly corroded and for which complete replacement is likely to be requested by the Afghan Government. The list includes the 45 rifles already re ported in Kabul Despatch No. 94 dated 2nd September, 1937. The numbers of the rifles and examiner’s marFliave also been given in order to facilitate any neces sary check by the issuing authorities. Appendix “ B ” contains a list of rifle bolts for which the Afghan Government intend to ask for replacements. The numbers of the bolts have been given. Appendix “ C ” gives a list of the number of defec tive or missing components and split woodwork for which the Afghan Government propose to request replacement. The list includes the defects and deficiencies given in paragraph 2 and the annexure to Kabul Despatch No. 94, dated 2nd Sep tember, 1937. The above appendices contain the total number of rifles, and their components in the whole consignment of 25,000 rifles in respect of which the Afghan Government intend to ask for replacements. 9. It is suggested that, should His Majesty’s Government be prepared to agree to the replacement of the defective rifles and components shown in Appendices ‘ A ’, ‘ B ’ and ‘ C ’ below, the earliest possible steps be taken to carry out the transaction, as the Afghan Ordnance officers have frequently referred to their desire to re-arm units of the Afghan Army with a more serviceable rifle, and to the disappointment of the Ministry of Defence when it was found that some 2,000 of these rifles could not be issued owing to one defect or another. They also stated that had the rifles been supplied by a country other than Great Britain they would have suspected a serious breach of faith, and probably have refused to accept a considerable number of the rifles. As the matter stands they attribute the split woodwork to faulty packing in England, and the excessive number of corroded rifles to either a somewhat hasty inspection of rifles which have been in store for some years or to contact with sea water during shipment from England to Karachi. A speedy replacement of the damaged and defective rifles and components would in my opinion go far in dispelling any unfortunate effects the transaction has caused.''1 APPENDIX “ C List of defective or missing components and split woodwork in the complete con signment OF 25,000 RIFLES FOR WHICH REPLACEMENT IS RECOMMENDED. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Handguards front (or fore) split .. ,.

It is hoped that Your Excellency will kindly take early steps to supply the missing and defective parts and to replace the 123 rifles. Your Excellency will doubtless be so kind as to inform me of the result of the action taken in the matter. I would also add that the list enclosed with my letter dated the 22nd August, 1937, relates to the present list sent herewith and it is requested that steps may kindly be taken for the supply of the missing and replaceable articles shown in the present list under reference.

EXTRACT from private letter from Lord Zetland to i^ord Linlithgow, dated 31st May 1938. 5 . I am not in the least surprised at your feelings of shock on learning of the attitude of the war Office towards the complaints which we made in connection with their supply of rifles tothe Afghan Government. The people at the War Office appear to be altogether unconscious of the enormity of their offence, so much so that I felt obliged to take the matter up with Hore- Belisha himself. I impressed upon him the extraordinary ill-effects which the communication of their omission to give the rifles the test which they had promised, woula have upon the Afghan Government, and I told him that since it would be essential for us to inform the Afghan Government of the omission of the test it was up to the War Office to do all that they could to make up for what they had failed to do. He was somewhat more amenable than the people at his office, but even in his case I had to reinforce my personal letter to him with a verbal explanation of all that was involved before he agreed to the despatch of the telegram which we eventually sent to Kabul.EXTRACT from private letter from ^ord Linlithgow to L,ord Zetland, dated 19th May 1938.

I may say at the outset that the Govt, of India neither in this bept. nor in the defence Dept, are con cerned in any way with this transaction, since it arose entirely out of an offer made by the War Office in August 1935 to supply weapons, which they represented as being just as efficient and a great deal cheaper than the rifles which the Govt, of India could produce. The Afghan Govt., who are experts in small arms, at first declined to consider the offer favourably, because they were afraid that the rifles would not be satisfactory. The War Office themselves suggested, in order to counter these criticisms, that as an additional safeguard each rifle should be given an indi vidual inspection and 'also a firing test for accuracy of sighting In order to cover the cost of these tests they added £0-5-6 to the cost of each rifle, bayonet and scabbard 'of which £0-2-6 would be due for firing test'. Owing to the lengthy discussions about the financial liability involved, in case the Afghan Govt, failed to pay the full instalments, the rfe'gotiations were not finally concluded until December 1936 and the War Office then commenced to ship the rifles to Afghanistan. Many of them arrived in Kabul not only damaged in transit, but also corroded and practically unserviceable. The Legation brought these facts to the notice of His Majesty's Govt, and suggested that various replacements should be made without extra cost. To this the War Office objected on various grounds and it was not until September 1937 that they admitted in response to frequent-2- ( ijs ) questions from the India Office that no firing test had in fact been carried out. The only excuse which they have put forward for their failure to carry out their side of the bargain is that a firing test would have considerably delayed the despatch of the rifles. In owning up to this the War Office merely suggested that they should reduce £0-2-6 from the price of the rifles, but did not agree to replace the unserviceable weapons or make good the damages incurred in transit. They have now finally agreed as the result of personal correspondence between the Secy, of State for India and the Secy, of State for War, (vide copy of private telegram from Walton to Fraser-iytler a copy of which is attached), to the course proposed in the Foreign Office telegram No.36 Forminka of the 9th May, to which you refer in your letter under reply. It is, I think, quite obvious that the War Office have behaved extremely badly over this and that they have placed both His Majesty's Govt, and Fraser-Tytler in an extremely awkward position vis-a-vis the Afghan Govt. The reduction in price by £0-2-6 of the rifles does not really compensate for the omission of the firing test, since that test would presumably, had it been carried out pro perly, have resulted in the rejection of at any rate some of the rifles which have actually been supplied. It is, I think, quite obvious that the Secy, of btate for India has fully realized the facts and has taken a personal interest in trying to get the War Office to repair the damage done * Yours ever, Sd.

I am sorry you should think that sufficient weight has not been given, in my Department's official letter of 14th April, to the political aspects of this question. I am m ost anxious to give full v/eight to these and to do whatever you consider most helpful. In fact I understand that my Department orally invited yours to let them know of any difficulty which our official letter of 14th April might raise, but had so far heard nothing further. Had it not been for policital reasons, we should not have been able to go as far as we are going in meeting the claims of the Afghan Government *&gt; £ in respect of damages and deficiencies.

In the circumstances whatever we do now the /fghan Government will regard us as having broken faith with them in the matter of this test to which they attached great importance* The effect of our belated disclosure of our failure to carry out the test may have really serious political repercussions, and I feel strongly that the very least we must do to mitigate the resulting embarrassments of the situation is to make simultaneously with that disclosure a generous offer to meet reasonable claims for deficiencies and damage to the rifles. The alternative would be tomake a substantial reduction in the price of the rifles - say to £3 ap&amp;e* There is ofpi 3 course no virtue rcerely In waiving the cost of a firing test which we did not In fact carry out. I am sure you will agree that the maintenance of our present happy relations with the . fghan Government Is a matter ofno little Importance, especially, perhaps, at the present time when Germany and Italy are endeavouring to Increase their economic stake In the country and with It their political Influence. I am naturally anxious that the question of a few old rifles should not affect our Interests at Kabul. I enclose a copy of a draft telegram which, subject to your concurrence, we would propose to send to the f/lnlster at Kabul, In the terms of which the Foreign Office have concurred. This has been based so far as possible on the Aar Office letter, though I realise that It goes rather further than you have yet agreed to do. But even so It represents the minimum which I regard as essential, and 1 do not feel any too sure that the proposed offer to the Afghans goes far enough to counteract the shock to their confidence In us which will result from the disclosure about the firing test. I hope that on reconsideration, and In view ofi a - 4 - the really important political consiaerations involved, you will be prepared to meet me to this extent. It would be desirable that the telegram to Kabul should issue before 1st May, when the next instalment of the purchase price is due from the Afghans, but time is short and this may no longer be possible.British Legation, Kabul. Demi-officlal No.824 L2nd March, 1938. My dear Walton, Would you kindly refer to the first paragraph of your letter No.P.Z.474/38 of 31st January 1938, on the subject of the rifles supplied by the War Office to the Afghan Gov err. merit, 2. The omission of the War Office to carry out the firing test is bad enough; their failure to inform you, and through you the Afghan Government, at once that they had omitted this, in Afghan eyes, most important test is little short of disastrous. When one couples this omission with the bad packing of the rifles, and adds to that the bad packing of the aeroplanes (the replacements have also arrived seriously damaged) the cumulative effect is sufficient to damage very seriously our reputation in Afghan eyes for efficiency and straight dealing, at a time when we can little afford to have our friends' faith in us further shaken. So unfortunate do I consider these omissions that were it not for the fact that the Afghans are paying for the firing test I should be inclined to recommend a course which I have never yet adopted in my dealings with Afghanistan, namely to conceal the fact from them that the rifles have not been test/: it is, however, we are bound to inform them, and the sooner we ao it the better. 3. the same time we must mitigate the effects of this disclosure as much as possible. In order to do this I make the following suggestions:- (a) We should offer to carry out the firing test nor, as an alternative to the refund of the 2s/6d $er rifle. The Afghans are not at all likely to accept this jffer, since J.C. Walton, Esq., CB., MC., India Office.many of the rifles have been distributed to the army, but if they do accept it we should be prepared to send up an expert from India, and carry out the test in Kabul at our own cost. (b) We should agree to replace the handguards and all the deficiencies already found, vide paragraph a of my despatch No.2, dated the 4th January 1938. (c) We should also agree to replace any deficiencies found in the remaining 16,000 rifles still to be subm.tted to detailed inspection, which the Military attache considers to be reasonable. 4 . Our agreement to the above should be conveyed to tne Afghan Government at the same time as we inform them of the omission to carry out the firing test. I suggest that we should take this action as soon as possible. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to Collier and Metcalfe. Yours sincerely, W.K.

H.M.G. fully realise that disclosure of omission of firing test may have serious political effects. They trust, however, that these may, to some extent, be mitigated by an offer to meet reasonable claims for damages ana deficiencies. You should accordingly now approach i^fghan Govt, on following lines, if you see no objection and consider that offer in terms proposed would have fair chance of acceptance as constituting final settlement of this embarrassing case. If, however, you have any comments on proposals in paras.3 and 4 below, I should be glad to consider them before you take action. 3. H.lv’.G. are anxious to leave the Afghan Govt, with no reasonable grounds for dissatisfaction, but think it desirable to deni with matter as a whole and in order to do so would be glad to learn whether Afghan Govt, propose to prefer any further claims in respect of remaining 16,000 rifles, as regards any such claims in respect of damaged woodwork and deficient components, you might, ii you see no objection, indicate that H.M.G. assume further claims would be© on basis of preliminary inspection reported in Military attache’s letter of aist December 1937, and accord generally with list given in para.6 of that letter. On receipt of full particulars (which should be verified by British Military Attache) in regard to final claims of Afghan Govt., H.M.G. will be willing to replace without charge damaged or deficient woodwork and components or corroded rifles to extent that may be necessary to give Afghan Govt, their full number of 35,000 rifles in reasonable and serviceable condition. 4. You would at the same time inform Afghan Government of omission of firing test. You may make such use as you think possible of arguments contained in War Office letter of September 1937, copy of which was sent to you by the India Office by the air mail of 23rd September last under No.P.Z.6233/37, H.M.G. will of course agree to reduce price of rifles by ^s/6d apiece. They suggest that to give effect to this reduction the next annual instalment of purchase price due on 1st May should be reduced to £12,604 and subsequent Instalments to £13,125. This arrangement would secure that as from 1st May Afghan Govt, would not at any date have paia more than if price of rifles had been fixed originally at £3.3.- instead of £3.5.6 each.6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 10P 2 / P. Z. 2668/38. Minute Paper. Department. /a Question of 25,000 rifles supplied by the War Office to the Afghan Government. We have now received the War Office official letter foreshadowed in Mr. Hore Belisha’s letter of the 12th April to the Secretary of State, though unfortunately it did not arrive until the Easter holidays had started. Though some parts of the War Office letter do go some way towards meeting our point of view, at any rate in principle, I do not think that we can accept it as satisfactory. In effect it seems that the War Office will be quite prepared ultimatel y to meet reasonable Afghan claims, but they are unwilling that the Afghan Government should be immediately informed in this sense, because they are afraid that it will lead to an increase in the Afghan claims (not yet received) in respect of the later consignments of 16,000 rifles. This attitude would be entirely reasonable were it not for the omission of the firing test, and the long delay in informing the Afghan Government of this omission. In our view (and the Foreign Office entirely agree) our position will be so difficult vis-a-vis the Afghan Government when the latter are informed of the facts in -I regard to firing test that it will be too dangerous vh. A. O-**. ^ politically to attempt to haggle over its--intrioata financial details. In face of what the Minister at Kabul says in his demi-official letter of the 22nd March to Mr. Walton (flagged) I think we can no longer contemplate informing the Afghans about the firing teat, as provisionally suggested at P.Z.686/38, without at the same time making an immediate offer to meet their reasonable claims for damages and deficiencies. The War Office still fail to appreciate that this is muchIV IT P'' ’* v ! more a political than a financial question, and they seem to argue that because the negotiations with the Afghan Government were largely conducted orally our undertakings to them are on that account less binding. The financial aspect of the question is quite insignificant (unless, indeed, the Afghan Government are so annoyed at the omission of the firing test as to attempt to repudiate the whole contract.) We could write to the War Office again officially, but this would be certain to result in still further delay, and perhaps the Secretary of State would be prepared to write again to Mr. More Belisha on the lines of the attached draft. It would be desirable to get the matter settled if possible before the 1st May when the next annual instalment of the purchase price is due from the Afghans; but there is little time left^and it would be better to let the Afghans overpay again rather than inform than about the firing test* until we are in a position at the same time to offer to accept their reasonable claims.

The Afghan Government2 will in any case regard us as having broken faith with them in the matter of the firing test to which they attached great importance, I find that as recently as March last year when the rifles were in course of shipment to Afghanistan, the Afghans specifically asked that more attention should be paid to the carrying out of this test. A copy of the^telegram from Kabul was sent to your Department with our Official letter No. P.Z. 1772/37 of 16th March, 1937, but we were not informed until six months later that the test had been overlooked. The maintenance of friendly relations with the Afghan Government os? t /&lt;r- ^ is an important &lt; British interest and i^-L* t .Vh~ view i-s that we s^implsr cannot afford to jeopardize our position at Kabul, especially at the present time when Germany and Italy are increasing their V economic^ and consequently also their potential political stake in the country nTV- anennnt o f—i the~real value of which to H.M.G. is little more than nominal. I recall that in November 1935 when the sale of these rifles to the Afghana-ims under consideration a~ ^ a. 3 K / representative of the V/ar Office stated incidental to their sale to the Afghan (Government) was nominally assessed at that time at £2. 5. - apiece, but that it might perhaps be more properly assessed at a scrap value of about 5/-. It was even suggested then by the War Office that the rifles might be given to the Afghans as a gift. I realise that the remainder of these rifles has now been transferred (on paper) from surplus to reserve stocks, but it seems clear that in selling them for £3. 5. 6 (£3. 3. - after deduction of 2/6 for the firing test) the War Office are making a substantial profit out of their transaction with the Afghan Government. I hope that on reconsideration you will be prepared to meet me to the extent indicated in the draft telegram.

Ai~l ! 938 THE WAR OFFICE, ^ 14th April, 1938. ii. , I am Gonmanded by the Army Council to reply as follows to your letters No. P.3. 6909/37 ox ^3nd November, 1937, and No. P.3.686/38 of 4th March, 1938, relating to the recent sale of 23,000 rifles to the Government of Afghanistan. The negotiations for the sale were conducted by H.M. Minister at Kaoul and the Council observe that the letter constituting the eventual agreement‘to supply the rifles (a copy of the letter was attached as Annexure I to Despatch No.175 dated 89th December, 1936, from Eis Majesty's Minister at Kabul) did not cover, no doubt unavoidably, many matters, such as the quality of supply and conditions of acceptance, which would normally be regulated in a formal contract of sale. Although these matters had to some extent been discussed in the preceding negotiations, the absence of a definite statement of arrangements is always a source of potential difficulty and dispute. Further, in some respects, the negotiations themselves appear to have been incomplete or inconclusive. The Council are unable, for example, to trace in the correspondence available to them, any record of an agreement as to the extent to which the Afghan Government were to be at liberty to question the qualify of the rifles supplied to them. The Council also have it in mind that the rifles were sold at a greatly reduced price, and were carefully selected and inspected before issue and that The Under-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, S.-W.l.9 7t&gt;y W the method ox packing was the same as had been &lt; * &gt; T U employed in previous similar instances without complaint. v ^ ZHUr In these circumstances the Council are not prepared lormally to admit liability 1’or the damage - complained of by the Afghan Government in respect of the first 9,000 of the rifles supplied or for any similar damage of which the Afghan Government may complain in respect of the remaining 16,000 rifles. But in view of the special circumstances of the case including, in particular, the omission ox the firing test, the Council are willing, in order to facilitate a final settlement of the whole transaction, to replace without charge damaged*components or corroded rifles to the extent that may oe necessary to give the Afghan Government their full number of B5,000 rifles in reasonable condition. In the Council’s opinion, however, an immediate offer to meet, in the manner proposed, the Afghan claim regarding the first 9,000 rifles, before the full claim of the Afghan Government is known, would compromise the position regarding the probable claim in respect of the -wwf\’rr remaining 16,000 rifles. ' I am accordingly to suggest that the Afghan' •4' Government should be informed that His Majesty’s * ^ Government while unable to admit any contractual liability are anxious to leave uhe Afghan Government with no reasonsole grounds for dissatisfaction. But they think it desirable to deal with the matter as a whole and in order to do so would be glad to learn whether the Afghan Government propose to prefer any further claims in respect of the remaining 16,000 rifles; and that, if further claims are to be preferred, the Afghan Government should be asxed to give particulars of the further number of rifles, if any, and of damaged or deficient components and accessories, the replacement of which they would regard as finally settling their claims. If these particulars could be cabled the Council would undertake to 1 n r; j give the matter immediate consideration. ,/ith/With regard to the omission# of the firing test, the Council offer no objection to instructions being sent to H. 11. .minister at j.*.abul to communicate at once on this subject with the Government of Afghanistan. r lhe Council suggest, however, that it would be desirable to mak e it a co ndition- of the settlement, on the lines proposed, of the Afghan claim as regards damages, that the Afghan Government Y/ill regard the question of the omission of the firing test as settled oy a reduction of k/6d in the price of the rifles. r fhe Council further suggest that to give effect to the proposed reduction of g/6d in tne price of rifles, 'the next instalment of the purchase price due on Isu Llaiv. 19GB. should oe reduced -go i:ik,604 and subsequent instalments -uo £lb,l£b. mhis arrangement v/ouid secure that as from 1st Hay next the Afghan Government would not have paid more at any date than if the price of the rifles had been fixed originally a^ £3.bs.0d. instead of £k.5s.6d each. 1 am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, for Permanent Unde?’-^™^ * ^ ae of State*As you asked in your letter of 4th April, I have sent for the papers about the question of the 25,000 rifles recently supplied by the War Office to the Government of Afghanistan. I fully understand the difficulties which you are experiencing in the matter, but there have been considerable difficulties on our side too. Without going into detail it is sufficient to say that the arrangements for the sale were of an unusual and abnormal character. The negotiations were conducted by His Majesty's Minister at Kabul and were brought to a conclusion by a letter written by him to the Afghan Government. The terms of this letter (no doubt unavoidably) did not provide for many points that would normally be regulated by a contract of sale and the /respective The Most Hon.the Marquess of Zetland, P.C., G.C.S.I. , G.C.I.E.g OrrlC’Z, A 1~I Erl A L— y s. /A e» « tPptiA, *1 L respective liabilities of the parties have &gt; ?£ therefore not been easy to determine. We have, however, been in consultation with the Treasury and when your letter reached me, my Department had a letter in draft which they were on the point of sending in reply to the two outstanding official letters from the India Office which you mention. This letter will reach the India Office very shortly, and while it is not entirely in the form you ask for, I hope that it will be found to provide the basis of an early settlement of the whole' transaction satisfactory to all parties.Demi-official Ho. 824. tv. c 0 British Legation, Kabul. ^7* Z V A ^ &gt; o z q 22nd March, 1988. ,J/Wrf I » J BZ- evv Ut H % Ilj Itcu ljkith t Ak Y - 4 APR 938 iDIA urr iC Would you kindly refer to the first paragraph of your letter Ho.

The omission of the War Office to carry out the firing test is bad enough; their failure to inform you, and through you the Afghan Government, at once that they had omitted this in Afghan eyes^ most important test is little short of disastrous. When one couples tnis omission with the bad packing of the rifles, and adds to that the bad packing of the aeroplanes (the replacements have also arrived seriously damaged) the cumulative effect is sufficient to damage very seriously our reputation in Afghan eyes for efficiency and straight J.C .’Walton, Esq., CB., MC., India Office, London• dealing, at a time when we can little afford to have our friends faith in us further shaken. So unfortunate do I consider these omissions that were it not for the fact that the Afghans are paying for the firing test I should be inclined to recommend a course which I have never yet adopted in my dealings with Afghanistan, namely to conceal the fact from them that tne rifles have not been tested. as it is however we are bound to inform them, and tne sooner we do it the better. 3. At the same time we must mitigate the effects of this disclosure as much as possible. In order to do this 1 /(!^J - 2 - I make the following suggestions (a) . We should offer to carry out the firing test now, as an alternative to the refund of the 2/6 per rifle. The Afghans are not at all likely to accept this offer, since many of the rifles have been distributed to the army, but if they do accept it we should be prepared to send up an expert from India, and carry out the test in Kabul at our own cost. (b) . We should agree to replace the handguards and all the deficiencies already found, vide paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 2., dated the 4th Januaiy, 1938. (c) . We should also agree to replace any deficiencies found in the remaining 16,000 rifles still to be submitted to detailed inspection, which the Military Attache considers to be reasonable. 4. Our agreement to the above should be conveyed to the Afghan Government at the same time as we inform them of the omission to carry out the firing test. I suggest that we should take this action as soon as possible. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to Collier and Metcalfe.

Yours sincerely, ie Viscount Hood4th April 1938. e/LtU ^^S-A-£/' , ' We wrote to your Department officially on 22nd November (our No.P.Z.6909/37) and again on 4th ^arch about the damaged condition of certain of the 25,000 rifles recently supplied by the War Office to the i-.fghan Government, but we have not yet had any reply. I will not bother you with all the details, which are fully stated in the official correspondence. Briefly, the position is that the Afghans have complained of serious corrosion and other defects in 45 of the 9,000 rifles in the first two consignments supplied to them, and have also asked for the replace ment of 725 fore-handguards which arrived broken owing to the unsatisfactory manner in which the rifles were packed in this country. The Military attache of the British Legation at Kabul, who has examined the whole 25,000 rifles, in conjunction with the Afghan military authorities, has also reported about 900 additional The Rt.Hon. L. Hore-Bellsha, M.p.i &amp; - a - caeee of smashed fore-handguards, etc., and a few other minor deficiencies among the later consignments. We have in my view the strongest possible case, and the Foreign Office are of a similar opinion, in asking the War Office to agree at once to make good the deficiencies of which the Afghans have already complained, and also to satisfy any other reasonable demands which they may make in respect of the later consignments - the reasonableness of the claims to be vouched for by the British Military Attache. What makes me so anxious to meet the outstanding Afghan claims without further delay (they have been waiting for a reply since last august) is that the Afghans are not yet aware that an Individual firing test, which was agreed on as part of the bargain with the Afghan Government and for which 2s/6d per rifle is being charged to them, was not in fact carried out. This omission was brought to our notice in an official letter from the War Office in September last, in which it was suggested that the information should not be disclosed to the Afghan Government until the Army Council had had the opportunity of considering further the claim for the3 replacement of the damaged components. In deference to this view the disclosure has not yet been made to the Afghan Government, but you will, I arc sure, agree that the omission of the test, the cost of which is part of the price that is being charged (it is being paid in six yearly instalments, of which the first has already been received), puts the British Government in a most unpleasant position; and, as you will understand, the political effect of the disclosure will be the more damaging the longer we delay In informing the /xfghan Government of the facts. Hence also my desire to gild the pill for them so far as I possibly can by agreeing to make good the other defects at the same time as we make the disclosure about the firing test. I am sorry to have to trouble you with this matter when you have so many heavy responsibilities. The amount of money involved is comparatively insignifleant; but the question really is a serious one when viewed from the standpoint of Anglo-Afghan relations and British prestige in that part of the world. I enclose an extract from a demi-official telegram we have just received from the British Minister at Kabul. You will see that he describes the position as little short of disastrous.i f - 4 - I shall, therefore, be grateful if you will give the matter your personal attention. »EXTRACT from demi-official telegram from the British Minister at Kabul, dated 25th March 1938, * * * * * I consider omission of the War Office (a) to sarry out the test and (b) to inform the Afghan Government at once through you of this omission is little short of disastrous and likely to shake belief of /.fghan Government in our efficiency and integrity. we must do what we can to mitigate effect of the disclosure now to be made and should therefore simultaneously take following action (a) offer now to carry out the test here as alternative to refund of two shillings and sixpence; (b) agree to replace hand-guards and all deficiencies already found; (c) agree to replace any deficiencies found in the remaining 16,000 rifles which Military attache considers reasonable.

The War Office are taking a long time to reply to our letter of the 22nd November. This is partly due to the fact that they have to consult the Treasury before replying. I understand informally from the War Office that they have only quite recently v/ritten to the Treasury and that there may still be some further delay before they are in a position to reply to us. In any case I understand that the War Office are not in favour of agreeing finally to compensate the Afghan Government until the latter put forward their final claims for the replacement of breakages and ** deficiencies in the later consignments of rifles, although it appears from^Kabul Despatch of 4th January at P.Z.686/38 that reasonable claims by the Afghan Government in respect of these later consignments could not amount to very much. Meanwhile we are still in the awkward and somev/hat immoral position of concealing from the Afghans the fact that the firing test (for which they are paying 2/6d per rifle) was not in fact carried out by the War Office. In view of the delay and of the probable attitude of the War Office tov/ards the question of compensation^it is suggested that the least objectionable course would probably be to inform the Afghan Government at once about the omission of the oa* o- L+jct firing test. They receive this information badly but their attitude may to some extent be affected by the prospect of a reduction of over 115,000 in the price of the rifles. We also know that these War Office rifles arrived quite opportunely for the Afghan / 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 JOP Government/; Government who were able to use some of them in dealing with the Ghilzai rebellion last summer and this also may to some extent affect their attitude in the matter. A draft letter to the War Office is suggested. ^Draft Paper. ^ p. 2.686/38. POLITICAL Department. DR;V T LETTER 4 MAR 1938 The Under Secretary of State, War Office, S. W* 1. Copy to F. 0. Treasury.

With reference to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires’ despatch N o. 94^ dated the 2nd September, 1937, I have the honour to forward as an annexure to this despatch a report from the Military Attache of this Legation on the inspection for major defects carried out by him in respect of the 25,000 rides supplied to the Afghan Government by His Majesty’s Government. 2. A summary of the defects and breakages in regard to which the Afghan Government will probably ask for replacements is given in paragraph 6 of the report. This summary covers all major deficiencies found. It does not however include the forty-five rifles for which the Afghan Government have already asked replacement, nor does it include a request for replacement in regard to the 16,000 rifles which have so far not been submitted to detailed inspection by the Afghans. I understand that owing to the severe climatic conditions obtaining in Kabul during the winter it may be some time before this inspection is carried out. It seems likely however that further replace ments will be asked for when it does take place and I await the instructions of His Majesty’s Government asked for in paragraph 5 of the despatch under reference a*s to the attitude they decide to adopt towards such a request, ais also towards the request already made. 3. I should like to take this opportunity of placing on record my apprecia tion of the manner in which Major Lancaster has conducted this long drawn out and wearisome inspection for major defects. The work was carried out at intervals throughout the summer and autumn, often in trying conditions, and to the detriment of the Military Attache’s more legitimate duties. 4.

Letter from the Military Attache, British Legation, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, dated the 21st December 1937. Inspection for major damage and defects in the 25,000 .303 rifles supplied to the Afghan Government by His Majesty's Government. I have the honour to report that I have now completed my inspection for major damage and defects in the 25,000 .303 1914 pattern rifles supplied to: the Afghan Government by His Majesty’s Government. 2. The inspection board consisted of three and occasionally four Afghan Ordnance officers and a representative from the Afghan Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I was assisted when necessary by the Military Attache’s clerk and Mr. Rees, the Legation Garage Superintendent. The inspection of the rifles took place on dates convenient to both sides between the 16th February and the 2nd November, 1937. 3. During the proceedings relations with the various Afghan officials were cordial, with the exception of the period during which the first two batches of 9,000 rifles were being examined when the suspicions of the Afghan Ordnance officers were aroused by the extensive damage done to the woodwork of the rifles during transit, and the discovery of a few labels bearing the name and number of British soldiers to whom the rifles had previously been issued. 4. All boxes were opened in my presence, and any damage or defect in particular rifles noted as they were taken out of the boxes. Separate reports have been submitted from time to time regarding the method of packing these rifles. Rifles packed in boxes of ten suffered considerably less damage than those packed in boxes of eighteen or twenty. In certain boxes containing eighteen or twenty rifles all the rifles were found to have split woodwork when the box was opened. This I attribute to faulty packing, and I consider that had all the - - - - ^ very much less damage would have ocdlirred ocp.reTARV’SLC244EAD- 30—25-1 -38—G IPS 5. Breakages and major defects in tlie whole consignment of 25,000 rifles are as stated in paragraph 6 below. The breakages and defects which came to notice in this preliminary examination have also been noted by the At glum Ordnance officers present at the inspection. These officers stated that alter / they had concluded their detailed examination they would forward to the Legation through the Afghan Foreign Office an official request for the replace ment of all split woodwork, defective or broken parts of the idles, and am rifles which they considered were unlikely to be serviceable owing to rust or corrosion. An official request has been received from the Afghan Foreign Office in respect of the replacement of forty-live rifles belonging to the first two batches of rifles, this was forwarded to His Majesty’s Government, vide Despatch Xo. 94 of the 2nd September, 1937. No further official request has been made by the Afghan Government in regard to replacements required for the remaining 16,000 rifles, and the Afghan military authorities have not so far asked me to inspect in detail any of the latter batches of rifles received by them. On the 26th December, I wats informed by G. M. Muhammad Akram Khan, the Afghan Chief Ordnance officer, that some time would elapse before they could complete their detailed inspection of the 16,000 rifles, but that as soon as the cleaning and detailed inspection of these rifles had been carried out he would let me know the result of their examination. 6.

We understand from them privately that they have still to consult the Treasury, but that as far as they can see at present while their reply will probably be generally favourable to the principle of compensating the Afghans for the broken woodwork and other serious defects, they are liivej.y to refuse to commit themselves finally until it is known what representations the Afghans are going to make about the later consignments.

The whole of the 25,000 rifles of 1914 pattern supplied by the War Office have now been delivered to the Afghan Government and the Afghans have paid in full the first of the six annual instalments of £12,646 in respect of these rifles. The next instalment is due on 1st May 1938. 3. Meanwhile the Afghans have complained of serious corrosion and other defects in the case of a small number (45 rifles) out of the first two batches, amounting to 9,000 rifles, supplied, and they have also dravrn attention to the 725 cases in the same two batches i v/here the forehand—guards of the rifles were found to r have been broken during transportation. The copy of a note received from the Afghan Government asking for the replacement of these deficiencies was enclosed in Kabul P.Z. 6361/37. despatch No.94 of 2nd September. The 45 rifles complained of have now been inspected by the Military Attache at Kabul, whose report, which is contained in P.Z. 6773/37. Kabul despatch No.102 of 30th September, substantially confirms the details given by the Afghan Government. Major Lancaster is of opinion that the corrosion,which in the case of the 41 rifles affected cannot be removed t will gradually eat into the steel and render the rifles unserviceable. 4. It will be recalled that when the question of supplying these rifles to the Afghan Government was mooted, the War Office were not prepared to give any particular or written guarantee with the rifles, but they stated that the condition of the rifles wassatisfactory and with War Office concurrence the Minister at Kabul was instructed to inform the Afghans that H.M.G. considered the^r-iflo^ to be reliable. The War -62ft-1' Office also recommended as an additional safeguard -tha*- each rifle should be given an individual inspection and firing test and this suggestion has been accepted by the s. d. Afghans, who agreed to pay 5/6 per rifle in respect of s. d. this, 2/6 of which was for the firing test. (Forminka x 1 o. 75 of 23rd August 1935.) A later description of the condition of' the rifles, which was furnished by the War Office for the information of the Afghan Government, was given in Forminka Fo.18 of 28th January last. It will be seen that the War Office^stated that although the external appearance of some of the rifles had somewhat deteriorated, their serviceability and length of life was not a.ffected. The facts which have now ' ” £ 4* CW7&lt; / been brought to light would seem to show thatTihe &gt; 7 inspection of the rifles hy the Wf&gt;-*-~Offico has not been * very efficiently carried out. More serious than this is the fact, which they have recently disclosed in their letter of September last (P.Z.6233/37), that the firing test,which they themselves originally recommended and s. d. for which the Afghans are paying 2/6 per rifle,has not been carried out at all. The Afghans will have to be informed of this and the effect of the information upon our reputation and prestige at Kabul may be very serious, especially at a time when the Afghans are establishing so many contacts with other European nations. I do not think that we can contemplste informing them of the position without at the same time offering to replace the serious deficiencies in the rifles of which they have complained and any similar defects which may be found in later batches.

As regards the damage to the for^hand—guards t i and certain other wooden parts of the rifles, the War Office/Minute Paper Department. Office at first contended that this might he due to climatic conditions, but, in view of the extent of the damage reported, they modified that attitude in their letter of 24th August (P.Z.5612/37) and suggested that it must be attributed to rough handling during transportation. They therefore proposed an examination of the last consignment of 4,000 rifles at Karachi with a view to determining whether the damage occurred before arrival there or on the last part of the journey from Karachi to Kabul, for the whole of which the Afghan Govt, are technically responsible. The report of the Ordnance Officer at Karachi, who carried out an inspection of a sample of the last consignment, has now been received (P.Z.6909/37). This report seems to establish fairly i conclusively that the damage to the forehand—guards has i resulted from the faulty arrangements made in this country by the War Office for the packing of the rifles. Most of the rifles were packed in lots of 80 in packing cases which were not sufficiently strong to keep them rigid, and which were not jointed or screwed but only nailed together. Moreover the rifles were packed in such a way that the full weight of the upper layers of rifles rested upon the bottom layer; as a result the top layers acted as a sort of hammer on the rifles down below when the cases were shifted about and the weakest part o^ the rifles on which the strain rested (viz. the i fore^hand^guards) suffered accordingly. Where, as in certain cases, the rifles were packed in smaller and stouter cases, no damage was found to have occurred, though even in these cases the method of packing is not considered to have been entirely satisfactory. 6 . In view of the facts as stated above v/e are t;063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 IOP now/now in a strong position to press the War Office to meet the Afghan claims, v/hich seem to he entirely reasonable, end p.lso to meet any similar reasonable claims which may later be presented by the Afghans in respect of the later consignments of rifles. The War Office agreed in their letter of 24th August to reconsider the question of replacing deficiencies when further particulars regarding the damage to the rifles had been received, and it is to be hoped that in view of reports now received they will make no further difficulties about meeting the Afghan claims.

Though the Afghan Government of cours cannot have expected that all the rifles would arrive in perfect condition since they were well aware that they were over 20/20 years old, it appears to the S. of S« that they had a right to expect that the rifles would he furnished to them in an entirely serviceable condition, especially since they had been informed that each rifle would be subjected to an individual inspection and firing test, for which s.d* they hod agreed to pay a charge of 5/6 per rifle* In the circumstances, the Marquess of Zetland considers that it will be very difficult to justify to the Afghan Government a refusal to remedy the deficiencies in the 45 rifles in question either by supplying other rifles in exchange or by replacing the defective parts* Moreover, a peculiarly delicate situation will arise when the Afghan Government are informed that, as disclosed in War Office letter No.0164/6307 (M.G*0*P*a) of September last, the rifles were not in fact subjected to a firing test, which they were led to believe would be carried out as part of the inspection* The effect of this information upon the Afghan Government is certain in any case to be most unfortunate, and, with a view to mitigating the political effects so far as nay be possible.

He trusts that the Army Council will share this view. 4. As the Army Council are aware, the Afghan Government have also requested the replacement of the woodwork of 725 rifles, the fore handguards of which were found to have been split. Details of the damage to the v/oodwork and of certain other minor deficiencies were forwarded in Kabul Despatch No*94 of 2nd September. A reference is invited in this connection to the Government of India’s letter of the 11th October forwarding a copy o^ the report of the Ordnance Officer at Karachi who carried out an examination of a sample of the last consignment of 4,000 rifles supplied* This report would seem to establish beyond reasonable doubt the fact that the damage to the woodwork has resulted partly, if not entirely, from the unsatisfactory arrangements made in this country for the packing of the rifles.

Lord Zetland hopes that they will be i ! prepared to replace the 725 split fore hand uardihandguards and other minor breakages of which the Afghan Government have already complained, and also any similar damage sustained by later consignments when the examination o^ these by the fghan Authorities and by the Military Attache 4 at Kabul has been completed# * 5# With regard to the omission of the firing test, the Secretary of State suggests that a relatively favourable opportunity for imparting this information to the Afghan Government will be presented as soon as they can be informed that the damaged components of the 9,000 rifles in the first two batches will be renlaced.

Arms and Ammunition - Arms for Afghan Government. Reference:- Headquarters, Western Command Nos.641/16/Gr, dated 14/9/1937, and 24/9/1937. The eighth batch of rifles, containing 4000, for the Afghan Government were inspected by me on the 24th and 25th inst. 2. Twentysix cases were opened and examined out of a total of 224 cases received. Two hundred and twenty of the cases contained 18 rifles (complete with Bayonets etc.) in each, and four contained 10 rifles complete in each. 3. Several cases whowed signs of slight damage in transit (these were opened) and the two mostly badly danaged were placed in bond in the Kings Wharehouse for special inspection. 4. The result of the examination is as follows:- The holding down battens (see sketch) were not sufficiently thick to be useful as it was found that the rifles could be removed without moving them. As however they were only fixed to the case by 2 nails many of them were found to be loose and out of position. During the period between the first day’s examina tion and the second the cases had been removed from the warehouse platform to the roadway in readiness for sealing by customs authorities and it is possible that 12 cases opened and no rifles found 2nd da 1 25-9-: damaged. 14 cases opened and 10 rifles found with fore handguards split.that the handling may have caused damage to the rifles but enquiries showed that they were not unduly rough handled# 5. Before making any remarks in regard to the suitability of the ’packing’, a short description of the method of packing must be given, and is as follows (a) A wooden packing piece is placed in the bootom of each of the two slots Tsee sketch) and nine rifles are placed head to tail on the packing pieces. (b) Two further packing pieces are placed in the slots above the rifles and the ISbayonets with scabbards are packed in the centre cavity thus formed. (c) A further nine rifles are then placed on top of the second pair of packing pieces, mentioned in (b) above, and two further packing pieces making six in all are then placed m the slots above the second layer of rifles. Holding down battens are then fitted as shown in sketch. Oil bottles and pullthroughs (18 of each) being placed in one of the end cavities formed by the top packing pieces. (d) Straw is used throughout the packing. 6. The packing of the rifles was considered to be unsatisfactory in the following respects (a) The cases were not manufactured sufficiently strong to keep them rigid and this caused considerable movement of the contents consequently the rifles rubbed against one another and against the wooden packing pieces when handled. In this connection it was noted that the cases were not jointed or screwed but were only nailed together, the lid alone being screwed down. (b) The wooden packing pieces provided between layers of rifles being free to move up and down were not so arranged as to put the weight of the individual rifles or even layers of rifles directly on the case as is done in ordinary rifle chest. Being straight pieces of wood, and free to move up and down, the packing pieces took tbs weight of the rifles above them and placed this weight on the rifles which supported the packing piece from below. 7. If accurately packed the whole of the weight of the upper layer of rifles would be borne proportionately by each of the lower rifles, - the weight coming on the lower rifles at points where the packing pieces touched them, i.e., on/on the fore handguards at one end. and at a point on the small of the butt at the other end. 8. In certain cases where the straw packing had become uneven during transit the packing piece, bearing the weight of the upper rifles, was found to be pressing the whole of its 7/eight upon one or two of the rifles belov/ it with consequent cracked fore handguard. 9. With this method of packing the top layer of rifles acts as a hazuner on the lower layer of rifles whenever the case is dropped, the smalls of the butt are sufficiently strong to stand this treatment but the fore handguards are not. 10. The packing pieces should either be fixed to the sides of the case to prevent any upper weight being thrust upon the rifles underneath or the packing pieces should be made to bridge the rifles as in the ordinary rifle chest. 11. The rifles packed 18 in a case made a package which is considered to be rather too heavy for the type of case used. The cases in v/hich 10 rifles were packsd showed no sign of damaged rifles, this appears to be chiefly due to the lighter weight with consequent easier haniling ard less weight on bottom layer of rifles. ' These smaller cases were not however nicely packed as they were packed 7 rifles in the bottom layer and 3 in the upper layer which left a cavity in the top layer suitable to take 4 more rifles. These small cases were actually old-jointed rifles chests and were rigid, whereas the larger cases ?/ere ordinary packing cases. In future consignments, it is recommended that cases holding ten rifles only be adopted and that some arrangement/arrangement be made so that the weight of rifles is transferred to the packing case by means of bridges or by fixing the packing pieces when in position, to the case.

Examiners’ marks were inspected and were found to correspond in each case with one of the specimens given in Appendix A to War Office letter No 01 ( , 4|626° (M.I. 1), dated the 24th August 1937, forwarded to me by Air Mail under India Office No. P.Z.-5612, dated the 1st September 1937. A detailed list prepared by Major Eancaster showing the number of each rifle, Examiners’ marks, details of damage as given by the Afghan Government (&lt;?/. the list for warded to you with my despatch No. 94 of the 2nd September 1937) and remarks by the Military Attache at his inspection on the 21st September 1937, is attached as an annexure to this despatch. 3. Major Lancaster is of the opinion that in moist cases the serviceability of these rifles would probably not be seriously affected for the present, but that, and in this he is supported by Mr. Rees who is a trained engineer, there seems little doubt that the existing corrosion, which in the case of the forty-one rifles affected cannot be removed, will gradually eat into the steel and render the rifles unserviceable. I have excluded Serial Nos. (40), (41), (43) and (45) as the damage to theise is by fracture and not by corrosion. 4. If it is assumed that no corroded rifles were passed for shipment, corrosion must have been caused during the journey. The latter may be divided into five parts : (a) before shipment, (b) on board ship, (c) at Karachi, (d) transit between Karachi and Peshavmr and (e) transit between Peshawmr and Kabul. To take these seriatim :— (a) It is ahvays possible in a damp climate that exposure took place be fore shipment but presumably all precautions were taken. (b) It quite frequently occurs that sea or rain water reaches goods while on board ship. (c) J can give no indications of the conditions in Karachi under which the boxes were unloaded from the ship, stored and loaded on to the train, but presumably as in (a) above all precautions w r ere taken. The Government of India might be in a position to make enquiries. (d) It has been ascertained that the rifles were transported by rail in covered wagons from Karachi to Peshaw r ar, and (e) Rifles v’ere conveyed from Peshawar to Kabul in covered lorries. There are two further brief periods of time during wdiich the rifles might possibly have been exposed to rain : (i) vffiile at Peshawar and ( ii) on arrival in Kabul. As regards (i) the rifles w r ere, I believe, in the charge of a military guard and here again the Gov ernment of India might be able to call for a report as to weather conditions and precautions taken. As regards (ii) the twm batches of rifles reached Kabul on the 20th January and the 23rd January, respectively. It has been ascertained from this Legation meteorological reports that no rain or snow 7 fell here on those dates and the rifles were stored in the Arq Magazine. 5. Subject to any information that the Government of India can give, it appears most likely that exposure took place on board ship. Unless, how r ever, it can be definitely established that corrosion occurred after the rifles left British India, the reputation of Great Britain as a reliable market from which to pur chase either new r or second hand goods will inevitably suffer in the eyes of the Afghan Government, if these rifles are not replaced [with the exception of Serial Nos. (40), (41), (43) and (45) for which parts might be supplied]. I understand that technically British responsibility ends at Karachi, but this fact would, 1 feel do nothing to rehabilitate our reputation since the Afghan Government would argue that from Karachi to the Afghan frontier the rifles were carried in British Indian trains and handled by British or British Indian troops.

No. 94, dated 2nd September, 1937. g*\TZ-. ^&gt;^^1 CONFIDENTIAL. ^SPATCH FROM HlS MAJESTY’S CHARGE D’AFFAIRES, KABUL, TO HlS MAJESTY’S ♦Secretary of^State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 94, dated the 2nd (received^Sth) September 1937. I have the honour to enclose as an annexure to this despatch, and with reference to correspondence ending with Katodon-86, a translation of a letter received by me from the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in regard to certain defects found m the rifles being supplied by His Majesty's Government to the Afghan Government. 2. This letter, which it is understood has taken some three months to dratt in the Foreign Office from material supplied by the War Office in May last, refers only to the first 9,000 rifles received. These rifles were inspected for major defects by an Afghan Board consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the presence of the Military Attache of this Legation. The following defects and deficiencies were noted' by the Military Attache :— Handguards, fore, split .. .. .. .. .. .. 725 Handguards, rear, split .. .. .. .. . . .. 15 Fore-ends, split .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 10 Butts, split .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 2 Swivels, nosecap, broken .. .. .. .. .. .. 2 Swivels, butt sling broken .. .. .. .. .. .. 2 Swivels, outer band broken .. .. .. .. .. l Pullthroughs, missing .. .. .. .. .. .. 2 3. The Military Attache also saw 82 rifles,^muzzles, nosecaps, bolts, maga zines, etc., of which were corroded. Some of these, in his opinion, could be made serviceable by the use of emery paper or other rust remover. His attention was also called to a number of rifles which bore traces of rust on external parts. He was not present at the detailed examination and the figure of 2,200 rides quoted in the letter from the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs no doubt includes both the above categories and also all rifles bearing the slightest trace of rust. The Afghan Goverrunent have, however, confined their request for replacement of defective parts to the 45 rifles enumerated in the list attached to the letter. 4. Major Lancaster is of the opinion, which, however, he did not express to the Afghan officials present, that of the rifles to which his attention was particu larly called, at least ten were badly corroded and that it is possible that there were more which he was not asked to examine. He therefore considers that the number of 45 rifles stated by the Afghan Government to be seriously damaged is probably not excessive. 5. It seems possible from India Office letter No. P. Z. 3028/37, dated the 24th May, 1937, that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared, as soon as the Mili tary Attache has seen them and given his opinion that all or some of them suffer from defects of a kind that render them unserviceable, to replace these rifles or supply serviceable parts for them, since, in all, they amount to only *5 per cent, of the total consignment in question. If, however, His Majesty’s Government desire an expert opinion it might be possible if the Government of India agree, to send them to India for inspection by an Ordnance Officer. I should be grateful for your instructions on this point in due course. 6. Major Lancaster states that the 725 rifles with a split forehand guards re ferred to in paragraph 2 of this despatch could certainly not be issued to troops in their condition when he saw them and most of these are presumably included in the 725 rifles for which replacement of wood-work is asked in the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It would appear that, as reported in Katodon-86, much of the damage to the wood-work of rifles, especially in the earlier consignments, was due to the size of the boxes used and the method of packing. After deducting 9,000 from the total of 18,980 rifles now inspected by the Military Attache only 4232 forehand guards were damaged out of the remaining 9,980 rifles or about 4-2 per cent, and many of these were packed in large boxes. The 1,550 rifles packed in boxes of ten sustained, as reported in Katodon-84, damage to forehand guards of i approximately one per cent. ^ 7. These figures tend to show that extra attention to packing and the reducticm in the size of boxes in some consignments caused a reduction in the number of broken forehand guards from 725 out of 9,000, or 8 per cent, to 15 out of 1,550 or one per cent. This will not have escaped the notice of the Afghan Government to whom the Afghan Ordnance officers have made their reports, and I hope it will be possible for His Majesty’s Government to agree to replace the wood-work of 725 rifles as requested by the Afghan Government at present and to take similar action in regard to future consignments, in which, if small boxes have been used, the damage should be much less. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India. Translation of a j)ersonal letter from. Aqai Abdul Hamid Khan, Aziz, for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty s Charge d'Affaires, dated; the 30th Asad, 1316 (22nd August, 1937). With reference to His Majesty’s Minister’s letter No. 73-P., dated the 25th March, I have the honour to state that according to information given by the officials concerned, out of the total number of 9,000 rifles received in the first and second batches which were inspected by Afghan officials and the Military Attache of his Majesty's Legation, the hand guards of 725 rifles were split and broken during transportation. The Military Attache noted their numbers with details of other breakages at the time of inspection. It was also noticed at the detailed inspection by Ordnance officials that 2,200 rifles were corroded, and serious damage had resulted in some cases. The Ministry of War is willing to overlook such damage to rifles as may be due to slight rust and is sending herewith a list of 45 rifles which have been seriously damaged. It is requested that necessary steps may be taken to replace the defective parts of these rifles, make up deficiencies and replace the broken wood-work of the 725 rifles referred to above, which are not at present in a serviceable condition. Kindly issue instructions to the quarters concerned that in view of the above defects proper care may be taken in future when examining and despatching further batches of rifles. Any other defects and deficiencies in the 9,000 rifles which may come to notice and in the rifles of other batches will be reported in due course. Translation. No. Number of rifle.

J*.e following number quoted. The War Office, London, S.W.l. E WAR OFFICE, LONDON, S.W.L 0164/6307 (M.G*O.F.aO September, 1937 Sir With reference to a verbal enquiry from the India Office relative to para.4 of War Office letter, No*0164/6260 (M.I.l.), of 24th August, 1937, on the subject of the rifles recently supplied to the Government of Afghanistan (India Office reference No. P.Z.3028/37), I am commanded by the Army Council to confirm that the rifles sent have not, in fact, been subjected to a firing test. Rather more than a year elapsed between the suggestion that such a test should be applied and the conclusion of a definite agreement with the Government of Afghanistan. It would not then have been possible to subject the rifles to'^a firing test and at the same time to despatch them as quickly as was desired. She Council regret that this fact was not brought to notice at the time and are, of course, prepared to reduce the price of the rifles by 2/6d each, being the amount included in the price to cover the cost of the firing test. Ihey apprehend, however, that the Government of Afghanistan may ask for some larger reduction in the price on the ground that the omission of a firing test has diminished their ^ confidence in the quality of the rifles. In the event of such a request being made, it might be replied that a firing test would have considerably delayed the despatch of the rifles; and further, that such a test would not be 'thought necessary if the rifles were being taken into use in the British Army, and would not have been suggested had not the Government of Afghanistan been dubious as to the quality of the rifles. Any doubts they may now entertain may perhaps be dispelled by the fact that the remainder of the rifles in question have recently beentransferred from surplus to reserve stocks, and are no longer available for disposal. If, exceptionally, any were now sold, a considerably higher price than that agreed upon with the Government of Afghanistan would be charged. Even though, in the Councils opinion,a reply on the lines suggested would be adequate, if appears that the time and manner of informing the Government of Afghanistan of the omission of the firing test should be carefully chosen. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for India in Council, the Army Council incline to the opinion that the information should be deferred until they have had the opportunity of considering further the claim of the Government of Afghanistan for the replacement of damaged components. Government of India and H.M. Minister at Kabul of which copies have been forwarded under India Office reference numbers P.Z.6113/37 and 5943/37, the Council are not prepared at the present stage to accept the claim of the Government of Afghanistan, and they are of opinion that although the evidence obtainable by an examination of the last batch of rifles at Karachi may not be conclusive, it will probably be found to be of material value in reaching a satisfactory settlement of the claim in question. In this connection it will be useful if in the comprehensive report, which has been called for, particulars of damage could be given separately in respect of rifles packed 10 to a case and of those packed 18 or £0 to a case. The last consignment of rifles was packed in 110 cases containing 18 rifles each and £ cases containing 10 rifles each. The larger and smaller cases have been used as they happened to be available and it is not the fact that smaller cases were resorted to as a result of complaints about the condition of rifles packed in the larger cases.

Sir, oTHE WAR OFFICE, LONDON, S.W.l. 24th August, 1937. pf- With reference to India Office letter No. P.Z. 3028/37 dated 24th May, 1937, regarding the condition of rifles recently supplied to the G-overnment of Afghanistan f I am commanded hy the Army Council to state for the information of the Marquess of Zetland that the Council find it difficult to understand how any of the rifles supplied could have arrived in the condition alleged by the Afghan authorities. Admittedly, the rifles were not new and the price charged for them was based on that fact; the rifles supplied v/ere, however, the best that could be found amongst the stock examined, and none that were in any way unserviceable according to British service standards were passed for despatch to Afghanistan* 2. The reference in telegram No.Katodo n 18 of 15.th March, 1937, to rifles labelled with the names of British soldiers suggests that some of the rifles seen by the Military Attache* were not taken from the consignments examined and passed in this country. When rifles have been inspected and passed they are stamped with the examiners 1 mark, and a copy of the marks used by the examiners who inspected the rifles is attached as Appendix ’A* to this letter. In view of this I am to suggest that the rifles complained of by the Afghan authorities should be examined again by the Military Attache to see whether they bear any of the marks shown on the attached list. If, as a result of further examination, any rifles bearing examiners* marks are found which, in the opinion of the Military Attache at Kabul, are so corroded or cut as to be unserviceable, the Council will be glad to receive particulars and will be prepared to consider the matter further when the total number of 25,000 rifles has been received by the Afghan Government. EMCLOSURE2 . 3 . I am to say that in view of the number of rifles which have now 'been reported to have arrived with woodwork in a split or damaged condition it is obvious that the damage cannot he entirely attributed to climatic conditions. The type of packing case used for these consignments of rifles has been used in the past for the despatch of rifles to Afghanistan in 1932, and subsequently to other places abroad including the Near East and in none of these cases is there any record of complaints that :.Mo rifles were damaged in transit* It appears not unlikely &gt; therefore that the damage in the case of present consignments to Afghanistan is due to rough handling in oo transit, and I am to request that the Council may be - provided with a full report on the method of handling and means of transport uded* A further and final consignment of 4,000 rifles was due l&gt;o be shipped for Afghanistan on S.S. Bangalore sailing on 19th August,1937 and I am to enquire whether it would be possible in that case to open the packing cases at Karachi and examine the rifles there to discover whether any damage occurs prior to their being handed over to the Afghan Consul tnere, or subsequently in the course of transport from Karachi to Afghanistan, for which the Government of Afghanistan is responsible. On receipt of the report requested, the Council will be prepared to consider further the question of replacing any damaged woodwork. 4 . With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter underreoly, I am to remark that a firing test is not included in the type of inspection known as an 'upright view', the cost of which has been included in the price of the rifles payable by the Afghan Government. 5 # a copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office, I am.

I wrote some time ago to the Foreign Minister on the subject of the arrangements for taking over ammunition at Landi Kotalf and also discussed the case with him. Lancaster has also talked it over both with the War Minister and the Chief of the General Staff, and finally I brought the whole matter up at an interview with the Prime Minister on Saturday. Unfortunately the greater part of this interview was concerned with the Rahnuma case and the Prime Minister was in such a bad temper that it was not easy to get him to pay attention to any other subject. On the whole however we have I think done all that is possible at this end to ensure that the Afghan representative and his lorries turn up punctually at Landi Kotal and I hope that they will do so on the 29th and on future occasions.

I have no desire whatever to dogmatise on a matter of this sort, about which I know very little, but I trust that the War Office will be able to furnish us with some evidence of similar cases of rifles exported to India, or elsewhere, whose hand guards have split in the same fashion, before they ask me, or Macann, to offer such an explanation to the Afghan Government. 3. I have in the last 27 years imported into India and Afghanistan, on my own account, rifles, guns, golf clubs, tennis rackets etc. etc. not once but many times, and I have never known an instance of the wooden parts of these weapons suffering from climatic conditions in any Attache who has, tells me that in many cases the handguards are not merely split, but smashed to smithereens. He attributes this to the fact that these rifles have not been packed in small arms chests, but in ordinary wooden packing way whatsoever, during the voyage. 4 I have not seen these rifles, but the Military J.C.Walton, Esq., CB., MC India Office, Londoncases - I quote the reports of the Ordnance Officer at Karachi who inspected the consignment^ - and that in consequence there has been a good deal of play inside the boxes which naturally injured the weakest part of the rifle, namely the wooden hand guard. Out of the 9000 rifles inspected so far the Military Attache has noted the following splits in the woodwork 725 fore hand guards. 15 hand guards, rear. 10 fore ends. 2 butts, 5. I very much hope that the War Office will agree to replace the split woodwork^if replacement is asked for in accordance with the decision arrived at in Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 1 telegram No. 47 dated 30th June, 1956 or alternatively will furnish us with some definite evidence to support their plea of »climatic conditions 1 .*THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed by the Secretary of State to enclose herewith for transmission by the earliest opportunity to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul.

WiK^V ^ ' (JsN s “ &lt;l ' sk - NjJS^- Vi; //v^ - JyZL**, We A'ave a good deal of sympathy f^r? you regarding the 1914 pattern rifle^/ At about the same time as we got your telegram No.36 we received a letter from the War Office (of which we sent you a copy) claiming that no improvement in their packing methods is possible and stating flatly that no rifles with corroded or cut barrels were sent to Afghanistan. The Military Department here agree with the War Office that a sharp change in climate and humidity would account for the split hand guards (which is a frequent trouble in India)especially in old rifles, but Lancaster’s definite report that some rifles are badly corroded indicates that the War Office inspection has not been as thorough as it should have been. Possibly the fuss will make the inspectors more careful in regard to future consignments. We have suggested to the War Office that they should offer to replace rifles suffering from defects of a kind which render them unserviceable^ other than defects which appear to result from causes outside the control of the War Office (i.e. split hand guards). We have suggested that the War Office should accept Lancaster’s decision regarding what^ rifles should be replaced under/ 5973under this criterion;* sud I hope that would not throw too much of a burden on Lajl£Xi8 lei j ^ ^ that the War Office will agree to our suggestion^but they have been very grasping throughout this transaction. b^ainiglad that you have spoken strongly to Muhammad Hashim regarding Afghan slackness in making the payments on the rifles. These payments are of course in themselves too small to be important^but it is desirable to accustom the Afghans to promptness in these matters in view of the big payments which will fall due in future.I Private. 3th May 1937. /jj ctlcu British Legation Kabul. / v /' '/J » J &gt; U i 11 . r I am rather bothered about these rifles we are supplying to the Afghan Government. I am firmly maintaining the attitude that you cannot expect a brand new rifle for £3,that they are guaranteed serviceable,and that on the whole the Afghan Government are getting a very good bargain. On the other side the Afghans contend that a corroded rifle is not serviceable,and that when they are paying an extra 5/6 for inspection and testing, they do not expect to get rifles in such condition. Generally speaking however they are going on the assumption that the British, if rather sticky about coining to any agreement,do not let one down when once they have agreed to supply goods. We have hitherto fully maintained that reputation in re gard to rifles and ammunition supplied from India,and it would be a great pity if our reputation were now to suffer on account of goods supplied from England. I very much hope that as a re sult of my wires on the subject the War Office will see that future batches-do not contain rifles of doubtful serviceability. On the other side of the picture is the Afghan failure to pay up the sub-instalments on due date. I wrotestrongly Minister on the subject on receipt of your wire,and as a result have made the rather clumsy arr angement by which I get the cheque each month from imrs the Afghan. Government direct. But you will no doubt have real ised that the payment of the April and May instalments were effected before any reminder could reach the Afghan Trade Agent from here,and that the failure to pay on due date was therefore simply due to the inefficiency of the Agent in London. he have of course got used to that sort of thing here,and I should perhaps have suggested that if the payment was not made on the 15th of any month the first thing to do was for the War Office to ring up the Trade Agent and ask him to send over the cheque at once. He would probably would have done so. I shall hov/ever take the earliest opportunity to lecture the Prime Minister on the subject of late payments, as being most damaging to Afghan credit. I don T t like the Waziristan situation a bit. What with the Mohmsnds in T 35,the Afridis in T 36 and now' the Wazirs, it looks as if the forward policy was not being successful on the lines on which it is at present being worked. But I cannot at the moment see what the alternative is. The Prime Ministerunder this criterion^ sird I hope that would not throw too much of a burden on Vvu5&gt;V I^jac^rstrer^ ^ ^ that the War Office wi ha tr st Af on CO im * th me whalways says that T x)eaceful x^enetration 1 is a contra diction in terms,so far as the tribal areas are concerned,and I rather think he is right. But I do not know enough about tribal mentality to venture a definite or inion in a matter of this sort. J.C.Walton Esq C.B. M.C. India Office,Whitehall.FILE COPY r- c i r • . &gt; U U v 5 13*0.

Subject:- ^5 -^ Reference correspondence ending with your No.13976/G.S.(0), Of 18th April 1937. 1. The conditions under which {Arms and Ammuni tion have to be handed over to the Afghan Government representative are extremely unsatisfactory. A communication to you in this respect was made under My 301/27/151/G, of 2nd January 1937. 2. In the case now under review, the circumstancei have been as follows:- On 9th April, 1937, your telegram No. 18976/ GSO was received intimating that 900,000 rounds of 3. A.A. was to be handed over to the Afghan Government at Landi Kotal on 2Lnd of April, under the same arrangements as In yourCRNC/18976/G.S.(0) of December 11th, 1936. In my 301/62/G of April 10th it was requested that the ammunition should be handed over Immediately! on arrival at Landi Kotal, and that arrangements be made to ensure that the .Afghan Representative produc«cjj sufficient and efficient lorries for this purpose. It was pointed out that trains only run from Peshawar to Landi Kotal on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Ctt April 17th It was further requested In this Headquarters telegram 301/62/G, that the ammunl arrive/^*arrive at Land! Kotal on April, 23rd, as it wa»jsEObiX undesirable to hold it at Land! Kotal for 24 hours.C^v (April 22nd was a Thursday when no trains run,and the station at Land! Kotal is outside the camp wire). On April 19th, it was intimated by you, after reference to Army headquarters, that It was not possible to alter the date of handing over to the Afghan representative, from 22nd to the 23rd, and that the ammunition must accordingly arrive at Land! Kotal on the 21st. Arrangements were made by this head quarters accordingly, to escort the ammunition (train)! througn the Khyber, guard it at Land! Kotal, load it at 0900 hours on the 22nd, hand it over and escort it to Torkham; your 18976/G3(0) of April 19th refers. These arrangements involve the use of a section of Armoured Gars from Peshawar to Torkham, and orders to ttMXjut five difference battalions in the Khyber In connection with safe-guarding end loading, also the presence of the D.A.D.0.3. at the handling over*2 All arrangements had been made by 09 00 hours on Aurxi 22nd, but there was no s%n of Toll Mishar Abdul &lt;/&amp;hia Khan, the Af^shan reore entative, or of anyjbrries. in reply to an enquiry, the Af^ian Trade Agmt at Peshawar intimated that he mew nothing of tliia transaction. Toll ilisiiar Abdul Waiiid &gt;Jmn eventually turned up at 11 00 hours, with 3 lorries only. In consequence, all arra^ements had to be cancelled, the acmanition e-uarded for a further 24 hours, the Armoured G&amp;r Section detained and accoramodatea at Landi Kotal, D.A.D.G.S. had to cancel an inspection arranged for the following day at HisAlpur, and' it was not until late in the afternoon of the 22nd tliat arrangements were compietad by the Af^^han reore^entatives to iiave the necessary lorries from Peshawar for the 23rd. On the 23rd lorries arrived from two contractors and a dispute ensued between the Drivers and Gleaners, as to which party was to carry the assaunition and this was eventually settled by the Afghan Trade Agent. By 11 30 hours the consignment was loaded, when two of the Drivers refused to proceed, and their lorries had to be unloaded and the contents reloaded into fresh lorries. 3. In addition to the inconvenience caused to and time wasted of all concerned, it is hi^ily undesirable, from the point of view of prestige, that troops should be kept waiting about on loading and on other duties in the presence of and at the mercy of inefficient foreign representatives and quarrelling lorry drivers. 4. In order to remedy this state of affairs I sug.ast:* (a) That all arms and ammunition be handed over to the AiVhan representative at Pes/i&amp;war Cantonment Railway Staii m and not at Landi Kotal. (b) Thai all load coolies provi Agent, and never by troops. K^bul and the Afghan Government.9 JIW1957 FILE inv. Telegram XL No.309, dated (and reed) 15th April 1937. From.. Fraser-Tytler, Kabul.

By 11.30 a.m. the consignment was loaded and two drivers then refused to proceed and their lorries had to be unloaded and the contents re-loaded into fresh lorries.

A copy of the War Office letter of 3rd May has been sent to H.M.Minister, Kabul, for his use in any discussion of the question with the Afghan authorities. 2. The Marquess of Zetland presumes that the information in p^ra.3 of Kabul telegram No.36 will be brought to the notice of the inspecting staff and that particular care will be taken to ensure that no rifles which show evidence of corrosion or rust or other defects are included in future consignments. 3. With regard to para.4 of the telegram, the Minister was informed in a telegram of 30th June, 1936 (a copy of which was forwarded to the War Office on 2nd July with India Office printed letter No. P.Z. 3886/3 6 ) that the Afghan Government would not be free to claim replacement of any rifles to which they might take exception after receipt. Lord Zetland foresees some difficulty in maintaining strictly this position since, 5973 despite/despite the fact that the rifles are being subjected to an individual inspection and firing test before despatch paid for by the Afghan Government, it appears that a few rifles at any rate have arrived at Kabul with serious defects. His Lordship therefore suggests that, in order to avoid risk of acrimonious dispute with the Afghan Government on this issue, it would be desirable to offer to take back and replace any rifles which, in the opinion of the Military Attach^ at Kabul, suffer from defects of a kind which render them unserviceable (other than defects which appear to him, in the light of the information in War Office letter of 3rd May, to result from causes outside the control of the inspecting and packing staff). I am to enquire whether the Army Council are willing to accept this suggestion. The Afghan Government might be informed that split hand guards are cUvA&amp;hc probably caused by changes irr-t**e- ol4m^4e and thst rifles suffering from this defect cannot be exchan *ed. The number of rifles having other serious defects would presumably be comparatively small. 4.

His Lordship therefore suggests that^in order to avoid risk of acrimonious dispute with the Afghan Government on this issue &gt; wlTT'Ch might result in their defaulting in tlie insLalmcnbj due yn r4he--rifles j it would be desirable to offer to take back and replace any rifles which, in the opinion of the Military Attache at Kabul, suffer from ^opiou-q defects of a kind which render them unserviceable (other than defects which appear to himy%o result from causes outside the control of the inspe cting and packing staff). flho numbcr-of inytiTerr-TTcra'ii-u pi esamably be egi aaia'ird. I am to enquire whether the Army council are willing to accept this vP suggestion. 4.

Negotiations have now been concluded for the sale of 25,000 1914 pattern rifles at the low price of £3.5.6. per rifle individually- inspected and delivered at Karachi. By the terms of the (Agreement we are not bound to complete delivery until 15th September, 1937, but we hope in fact to hand over all the rifles by the end of June. The first batch of 5,000 rifles was due at Karachi on 29th Decembert The purchase price of £81,875 will be paid in six equal annual instalments of £13,646 each, the first of which is payable in ten equal monthly sub-instalments of £1^364.12.0. The first of these sub-instalments was duly paid on 15th December, 1936, but, with typical inefficiency, the Afghans were £64 short.!L. 7^- million rounds of ammunition are also to be sold by the Government of India to the Afghan Government; three million rounds were to be delivered in the middle of December and 44 million rounds between April and August 1937. The purchase price of Rs.6,97,500 (£52,312.10s) will be paid in six equal annual instalments of Rs.1,16,250 (£8,718.15s), the first of which was due on 15th December, 1936. 3, The negotiations for this deal have been very prolonged. The Afghans made a specific request for rifles and ammunition early in 1935, and the Government of India sold them 5,000 new rifles with ammunition in August 1935 as an urgent matter. In July 1935 we made an offer of 10,000 1914 pattern rifles but the Afghan Government stood out for as many as 25,000. It was, however, not until the question of the incidence between Indian and Imperial revenues of special expenditure on Afghanistan was settled in the Spring of 1936 that we were able to offer so many as 25,000 rifles on credit (P.Z.2891/36). Owing to dilatoriness on the part of the Afghans, this offer was not discussed at Kabul until 28th July (P.Z.5550/36), but it was accepted in principle on 10th August (P.Z.5876/36). There were, however, further difficulties over the ammunition, the Afghans beirg unwilling to accept the Government of Indian offer as it then stood of 2 - 5 - million rounds to be supplied each year for six years and to be paid for one year in arrear. At our suggestion (India Office telegram of 8 th September), the Government of India reconsidered/ j v ' \ro Ko.'b ulV S rV^Minute Paper Department. t**V: CJ^rQ£T*.i*X i's oAr . ®&amp;\-T ■ ftBBSI \v .y4- f)l\ reconsidered this offer, and the agreement recorded in &amp; paragraph 2 above resulted. The settlement of detail^ of secondary importance^, has delayed the formal conclusion of the transaction, but all these now seem to be disposed of. 4 .^ There remains unsettled one point of substance v/hich does not affect our negotiations with the Afghans. It is dealt with on a separate file and relates to the nature of the liability on Indian revenues in the event of an Afghan default, and the question whether the War Office should be paid their out of pocket expenses (which amount to £25,625) inthe same financial year as that in which they are incurred ,irrespective of whether there is an Afghan default. We have just received a letter from the Government of India on this point which is now under consideration. Military Secretary . To see. V'V' ^0 .

We agree that the provisional agreement reached at Kabul may be confirmed; tnis is of course without prejudice to our view of Indian liability in the event of an Afghan default. As regards details •- (1) Rate of delivery * We anticipate that we could effect delivery^in six batches, one of 5,000 and five of 4,000 at monthly intervals. Tn deference to the views of the India Office, we are prepared to do this. If the first batch is to arrive in December it must be sent off without delay. V/ill you let me know as soon as all is clear for us to release it?'? (2) Point of delivery . We have no objection to delivery of the third and subsequent batches being made to Afghanistan at Landi Kotal instead of Karachi, provided that India assumes entire responsibility from Karachi onwards. If India is to recetvevthe freight charges for this part of the journey Afghanistan, the Afghan liability will be increased pro tanto. In our view this must not affect in any way what India undertakes to do by way of indemnifying Army Funds in the event of an Afghan default. For the batches in question, the rifles will presumably have to be consigned to an officer of the Government of India in Karachi and not to the Afghan Consul, Karachi, Will you let me know to whom exactly? (3) Mode of payment . Afghanistan should arrange for a bank in London to make' the payments on the due dates by cheques drawn in favour of 'The Under secretary of Stateg#tWar ,/ e^±ce«. 4*vA, &lt;SC*vl' if Xt* 4 JiSL' (I‘.S) ( 7L PfrUls, 7 3 *»/.

October, but in the short time available we cannot get a sizeable batch of rifles inspected and packed for despatch in that vessel. Sailings thereafter are at approximately monthlypLntervals so that the first batch if sent at the beginning of November should arrive at Karachi about the middle of December,the freighters taking 4-5 weeks for the journey. In this first batch we hope to send 3,000 rifles. The subsequent monthly batches will probably each consist of about 2,500 rifles. It may however,be possible to work in an extra batch on the Transport ’’DORSETSHIRE” which is due at Karachi on 4th January, 1937, 5 uJrj-ajzA' u» ,0 that you would probably prefer that the Afghans should receive the first batch and signify their satisfaction with them before we despatch any more. Having begun the despatch of the rifles, we should ourselves prefer to go ahead as sailing opportunities offer; moreover, the delay in later batches might (though not necessarily) spread out the total period of despatch over a longer period than the eight or ten months now contemplated. These are not, however, objections of importance if, for reasons of policy, you have a definite preference for holding up later batches until the first batch has been approved. Will you please let us know as soon as possible to whom the rifles should be addressed at Karachi, where The next sailing from London to Karachi is on 5th You mentioned to me this morning, on the telephone H.A.F.

I understand from Major Cockram that in the Army in India at least 250 rounds are expended per rifle per annum in peace conditions and thus the Afghan request for 600 rounds per rifle is reasonable taking into account the fact that their reserves are low. The Afghan Reserve Fund is able to bear a greater liability in respect of ammunition thah the Government of India’s offer would put on it. There is in the Fund:- Contribution for 1935-6 £37,500 ' ' 1936-7 37,500 £75,000 The liabilities thrown on the Fund this year are:- Payment to War Office in respect of say 10,000 rifles supplied (out of pocket expenses less first instalment paid by Afghans) £4,792 Supply of five aircraft (less first instalment paid by Afghans) 25,918 Training of Afghan pilots and mechanics in India - say 2,000 fj, /Jr 'tvw-'K /bo f v CTO o ir&amp; /U ^ /rv ^ £32,710 We thus have left £75,000 - £32,710 = £42,290.

There are no possible alternative charges on the Fund except conceivably that in respect of an air service fr an Lahore to Kabul, but a further objection to this scheme is that we would have rather a small reserve in 1937-8 for any unforeseen contingency arising between now and 1938-9. We could however supply 5 million rounds this financial year and 4 million next financial year without inconvenience. (sd.)

Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. Please see the submission at P.Z.2891/36 and the telegram of 5th May to Kabul sent thereon. Major Hay communicated our offer to the Afghan Government on 23rd May (P.Z.3886/36), but they appear not to have considered it and there is reason to believe that they are seeing whether they can get better terms for .303 rifles and ammunition from foreign countries such as Belgium. Perhaps, however, we need not feel concerned about the Afghan delay in accepting our offer or at their apparent dissatisfaction with our terms^which are very cheap. This is ordinary Oriental bargaining. e L. Colonel Fraser Tytler was authorised to agree to payment for the rifles being spread over six annual instalments, if as a result of his /his further discussions with the Afghans he judged this essential for acceptance of our offer. It seems clearly necessary to make this concession. On ihe other hand the Afghan objection to the payment of the first instalment on delivery seems unsubstantial. as C olonel Fraser Tytler pointed out^we can arrange to deliver at a date convenient to the Afghan Treasury and I do not think that we should give way on this point, Its especially as a concession would increase our difficulties regarding liability for loss as between Imperial and Indian revenues. Please see in this connection our letter of 16th July, P,Z.4876/36 to the Government of India, It is most doubtful whether the Government of India would modify their offer regarding ammunition j which was to supply 2-J- million rounds per annum, payment to be made one year after delivery. We know, however, that Imperial Chemical Industries would sell munitions to the Afghans more cheaply than the Government of India and would consider giving credit. A submission suggesting that^if I.C.I. agree Colonel Fraser Tytler should be authorised so to inform the Afghan Government is being made. 4. No action on Kabul telegram of 3lst July seems necessary.

Dear Walton, Your further letter (P.Z. 3886/36 of 10th June) about the Afghan rifles, with the draft despatch to Fraser-Tytler, calls for one or two observations on our part. To deal with the inspection point first: the Afghans are getting (and paying for) an tf upright view' of these 1914 Pattern rifles at Weedon, and that inspection, which is not afforded to surplus stores normally disposed of by the Army, should ensure that the rifles are despatched from this country in a serviceable j condition. We do not agree that the Afghans should be free to claim replacement of any rifles or parts to which, for various reasons, they might take exception after receipt; though we should, of course, be prepared to examine any complaint as to numbers, e.g., that any cases did not contain the stated quantity of rifles. If the Afghan Legation in London could arrange to have someone at Weedon to see the rifles inspected and packed, we should not object; and no doubt when the rifles are unpacked on receipt by the Afghans, the Military Attach^ will be there to see that there is nothing gravely wrong with the consignment? Apart from the difficulties attaching to defining agreed deficiencies as mentioned in your draft telegram, is there not the risk that the Afghans might use the pretext afforded by such inspection to upset the whole arrangement, if, as apparently you think possible, they had in the meantime had reason to reconsider it? With regard to the rate of despatch, the number of men who can be turned on to the inspection of the rifles is limited, so that the task could not be completed under, say, three months. On the other hand it would be J.G. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.G., The India Office, S. W. 1. inconvenientinconvenient to spread the work over more than twelve months, so that within those limits we can arrange despatch to fit in with your projected plans for delivery: the arrangements proposed in Foreign Office telegram No. 38 of 5th May to Kabul - which we saw in draft - would fit in with the necessary work on the rifles at this end. Your present draft to Fraser-Tytler appears, however, to vary this plan in favour of one for spreading both the despatch of the rifles and payment by the Afghans over a lengthy period. We had thought, from Kabul telegram No. 92 of 8th September last, that the Afghans wanted the whole 25,000 rifles urgently for rearming their troops: is it now proposed to restrict their 'credit' to one batch of rifles at a time? I am sending copies of this letter to Bridges and Collier. Yours sincerely,Minute Paper, P.Z.iy¥«/36 political Department. A draft reply to Katodon 52 about arms and vo ammunition is submitted, for reference to the War Cfiice and the Foreign Office, and also a letter to cover the VC- draft to the War Office. The difficulties regarding inspection are that most of the deficiencies in respect of the 5,000 rifles of the Government of India were due to rust, but $cocv\Q^ presumably we cannot allow the Afghans to claim streh a&gt; high standard in the case of old rifles as in that of new ones. There is also the difficulty that inspection at Karachi would involve unpacking and repacking of the rifles there. Possibly it will be necessary to arrange for delivery to be made at Landikotal, the Afghans paying something extra in respect of the rail charges between Karachi and Landikotal. But these points can be disposed of by Colonel Fraser-Tytler according to the discretion which it is proposed to give him. The replacement of the deficiencies may also raise the question of the incidence of their cost between the War Office and the Afghan Reserve, bfLscr*- core, -SVcx. cVo-Ccucv v&lt;, _ ‘s.eejo'-s 'O. • \R l-C \\VeT -a.

Sir, I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to your letter P.Z. 1674/36 of 11th April forwarding copies of telegrams, etc., relating to the supply of rifles to the Afghan Government. The Council observe, from the ^ 3 %. Government of India’s telegram No._875_ofL6th April, that substantial agreement has been reached semi-officially with the Treaury with regard to the fund which the Indian Government propose to create for the purpose of financing political expenditure in connection with Afghanistan; and they note from your letter under reply that the liability in respect of the 10,000 rifles, 1914 pattern, already offered to the Afghans, and of the 15,000 additional rifles now under consideration, in the event of Afghan default on the agreed purchase price, has been accepted against this fund by the Government of India. I am to say, for Secretary Lord Zetland’s information, that the Council are prepared to maice available for offer to the Afghan Government the further 15,000 rifles, 1914 pattern, now requested. In view of the undertaking by the Government of India referred to in the previous paragraph they agree that their claim against the Afghan expenditure fund of that Government, in the event of default on the part of the Afghans, shall be limited to the out-of-pocket expenditure incurred from Army Funds in respect of such of these additional rifles as had not been paid for at the time of the default, as in the case of the 10,000 rifles already offered to the Afghan Government. Ilqirt The Council observe, from the third paragraph of your telegram No. 12 38,to the Government of India, that it is proposed to authorise His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.

If this course is regarded as essential to the acceptance of the offer of these rifles by the Afghan G-overnment, the Council are prepared to defer to Lord Zetland’s views in the matter.

An attempt has therefore been made to review the effects on the proposed Equalisation i*und of the supply of (a) the 10,000 rifles with 6 million rounds ammunition at the rate of 600 rounds per rifle; (b) the further instalment of 15,000 rifles with 9 million rounds ammunition at the rate above; (c) military aircraft, ana the establish- ment of (d) a civil air service between .Delhi and Kabul, 2, The result is the enclosed memorandum drafted in the finance Department with the conclusions of which we in this Department are in general agreement. We shall be addressing to you separately a aetailed letter setting forth the proposals for the civil air serviceservice, and I need not enlarge further on this subject except to say that the estiiaate works out at a little over 3 lakhs per annuia, of which the suggestion is that a little more than £ should be borne by the Government of India from their civil air budget, and about ^ should fall on the Fund, provided of course that as a result of this corre spondence, His liajesty 1 ® Government take a decision which enables us to establish that Fund, 3. As to the other items it is only necessary to gay here - (a) that our military advisers think that a further supply of 15,000 rifles is reasonable for the efficient rearmament of the Afghan arqy; ( b) tnat it is assumed that the 2nd and 3rd instalments of 10,000 and 15,000 rifles respectively will be supplied by His Majesty^ Government from their stock of 1914 rifles; (c) that we fully realise that once the supply of 10,000 rifles is made, it may be necessary at a later stage to take a decision to continue the annual instalments of ammunition connected with thisitem, even should the Afghan Governjnent default in repayzaent, ana in this event the laemoranduai shows that the cnarge could he met from the provision of 1 lakh per annum proposed to meet unforeseen charges or from its unspent balances} (d) that we accept as accurate the Linister’s estimate in the enclosure to Kabul despatch 93 of the 24th August as to the necessary number of military aircraft, and agree that 12 i s the minimum number which could be regaraed as effective. We also consider that there are strong practical arguments for supply of military aircraft from British rather than other sources, since in the event of war with Afghanistan, however improbable that contingency at present may be, we should be able to control supply of machines and spare parts and so render the enemy's air arm at least temporarily innocuous. At the same time in another situation the possession of Britisn machines by the Afghan Air force would be a material factor in aiding the collaboration of the Afghan air force with our own. 4. We feel that analysis of the financial position disclosed in the finance Department's memorandummemorandua enclosed with this letter should assist His iajeet^s Government to accept the general proposals for the establishment of 6h Equalisation ihnd as set forth in our telegram Ho*2475, dated the 14th September 19 35, as further explained in our telegram No. 3049, dated the 8th November 19 35* 5* JTraser-Tytler, who has recently been in Delhi, has impressed on us the difficulty with which he is faced in being unable to discuss any of these proposals with the Afgnan C vemment on their merits, or to indimate to them the probable attitude of xli s Majesty* s Government and the Government of India to any of their requests. We hope therefore that on receipt of this letter and our official letter on the Civil Air Service scheme, you will be in a position to communicate to us without further delay the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of our proposals for the establishment of tnis J*und, and for the assumption by His Majesty’s Government of responsibility for meeting demands beyond the resources of the Fund. Yours sincerely, 3 d, o. K. Caroe. J.C. wait on, Esquire, C*B. ,M*C., India Office, London*MEMORANDUM . The position ia that prohahly not one of the current proposals to give aid to Afghanistan is in the view of the Government of India so imperative as to override all financial considerations# nor except at a time of war or if war were imminent do the Government of India contemplate any future necessity to aid Afghanistan irrespective of the cost. Rut the Government of India do recognise that there must he a balance between political expediency and financial necessity. For the reasons 3 set out particularly in paragraph of their telegram No.^475, dated the 14th September the Government of India consider that a sum of ks.5 lakhs annually is the maximum whicn in the light of past, present and prospective financial conditions and of internal politics in India they can be expected or can afford to devote to Afghanistan affairs. According to the existing relationships with the Afghan Government the Government of India are thus offering to devote J&amp;. 5 lakhs of Indian revenues to expenditure purposes which are substantially within the control of His majesty’s Government ana up to this limit they do not ask His Majesty** Government to undertake any corresponding financial liability at all. But as a condition of their rendering this first reserve for the purpose they ask to be ordinarily exonerated from further demands. They ask that in consideration of their more or less automatically bearing the first portion of Afghan expenditure# His Majesty’s Government should undertake to shoulder expenditure beyond that limit. The Government of India would go so far as not•...2 not to regard even tnie condition as an irrevocable one in ail circumstances. They would agree that, if on any special occasion tne extra burden thrown on His Maj esty ’ s Government exceeded all reason, then a case might arise for the Government of India* s undertaking a particular liability even beyond the balance of the SWid* 2* The Government of India therefore measure the merits of each and all oi the current Afghan expenditure proposals in the light of this financial setting and they must take into account their cumulative p+atu/ effect. The varous ite^.s under consideration at moment are i - (a) 5,000 rifles and 5 million rounds ammunition already supplied - about ks.8 lakhs. These have been supplied from Indian Army stocks which will be replaced only gradually. The Government of India are prepared to assume that this transaction will not impose any liability on the fund# (b) 10,000 rifles 19i4 pattern - about &amp;»4$ lakhs. - to be supplied by Hi s Majesty*s Government, uany defaults to fall on the Government of Xnoia. (This presupposes a decision in a particular way of the recent provisional decision taken by His Majesty^ Government in telegram Ho# 3720 of 19th November 193b, which should not be taxan as prejudging this issue.) ^c) 6 million rounds of ammunition in connection with (b) twt to be supplied by India. it is • • 4 assumedassumed that this would be supplied at 1 million rounds (say, its. 1 lakh a year) a year and that in default of payment further supply would cease. But it cannot be ignored that circumstances might necessitate a continued A (a) free supply at the cost of the fund, ihrther 15,000 rifles 1914 pattern - about £s.6f lakhs* As under (b), the expenditure is to be defrayed by His i^jesty^s Government, any default to fall on the Government of India* | («) 9 million rounds of ammunition in connection 41 th (d) but supplied by India at million rounds (say ks. 1$ l&amp;idas) year.

(«) The Delhi-Lahore-Peshawar-Kabul air service. i*or the purpose of the following paragraphs it is assumed that the Lahore-Kabul section would be regularly chargeable to the fund - about its.

The total sum repayable ky Afghanistan under items (a) to (f) above would b© # say, is. 45 lakhs* Over a period of six years this amount would not be an impossiole burden for Af gaani stan1 Normal Afghanistan to tear. 0n the other hand, in the present unsatisfactory economic conditions of the country defaults in payment must he regarded as not unlikely. An annual unforeseen oharge of £s. 1 lakh described as normal is assumed in the following state- ments. Hence the most optimistic forecast is on the assumption that all in st aim ant s are punctually paid - 19 35-56 Credit s. debits.

Department. The question of the farther supply of 1 d, 000 rifles to the Afghan Govt, has been held up pending discussion of the general question of incidence of expenditure on Afghanistan. There can be little doubt that if this question will, as we now hope, be satisfactorily settled before long, it would be politically expedient to make this further supply to the Afghan Govt. We might therefore, perhaps, address the War Office on the question whether they would find it practicable to supply 15,000 more rifles for the same price as the 10,0U0nfles already offered. A draft letter to the /.0. is submitted. if it is decided that the additional 15,00G rifles can and should be supplied (making a total of 25,000 1914 pattern rifles in all) and an agreement as to terms is reached with the Afghan Govt., it probably might still be desirable to send 10,000 of these rifles in advance of the further supply, so that if by any chance the Afghan Govt, find that the rifle does not suit them, our commitments (or alternatively the Afghan commitments) in respect of the supply of this pattern will have been limited. /2T^« -/hA r *C&gt;v ^1 Draft Paper.

It will be observed that the Afghan Govt, are anxious that the question of supplying the further 15,000 rifles which they require should be settled at the same time as that of the 10,000 1914 pattern rifles which have already been offered to them on the terms authorised in the telegram sent to H.M.

The general question of the incidence as between the G. of I. and H.M.G. of expenditure and liabilities incurred in the interests of Anglo-Afghan relations has recently been under discussion with the Treasury and the G. of I.a The' S. of S. is not without hope that this question may shortly be decided by the establishment of a special Afghan fund on the lines of the proposal which is described m para. 7 of the enclosed memo. - As regards the political expediency/expediency of meeting the Afghan request for a farther supply of 15,000 rifles, reference is invited to the telegram from H.M. Minister, Kabul, of 2Qth October last No. 127.

The Afghan War Minister has stated that the full supply of 30.000 rifles is required to complete the armament of the Afghan Army, and it is not anreaooftfrbie that the Afghan Govt, should hesitate about accepting the offer of 10.000 1914 pattern rifles until they know whether the balance of their requirements can be supplied with rifles of the same pattern.

The stability and friendship of the Afghan Government is important to British interests for two reasons - (i) an unstaole Afghan Government would be unable, and an unfriendly one might be unwilling, to co-operate with us in the maintenance of order among the Pathan tribes on either aide of the furand line; this may be regarded as a specifically ^ndian problem; (ii) a disunited or unfriendly Afghanistan, or a weak Afghan Government, would no longer serve as an efficient buffer against military aggression or (what is even more likely) revolutionary intrigue directed towards India by the Soviet Government; in such conditions it would be easy for that Government, by bringing Afghanistan, piecemeal or as a whole, under economic domination and political influence, to sap the approaches to India and gain a base most conveniently situated either for the preparation of future military aggression or for the promotion of that internal revolution in Inuia which is the acknowledged aim of the communist international. v/ith reference particularly to the danger of military aggression the Cabinet on 14th March, 1934, reaffirmed the previous policy of regarding the independence and integrity of Afghanistan as essential to the defence of india and the Empire. 2. it is clear that the second interest referred to above is not only, nor even mainly, a distinctively Indian interest, but is a British interest in the widest sense. But it is also true that in the concrete the two interests are so interlinked that, in considering the partieularjpueations which arise, it is for the most part impossible to estimate otherwise than quite arbitrarily in what proportions the distinctively inuian or the wiuer imperial aspect of the matter predominates. 3./—- rszn. :— rot) 3, In the caoe of a hypothetical war in, or with, Afglianictan, a distinction is arawn between the tv/ , o aspects of our interest in that country* A war with Afghanistan alone or with Afghanistan and the tribes of the North West Frontier (i.e. a war arising out of the necessity for maintaining peace and order on the frontier) would be regarded as a matter of distinctively Indian interest, would be a taaic for the Army in india alone, and would bo financed from Indian revenues. But on the other hand, it is recognised that a war in defence of Afghanistan against Hussia, or a war in defence of India against ]iU;;sia and Afghanistan in alliance, would not be a matter of purely xndian concern nor a possible task for the Army in India alone, but that it would be necessary to employ forces raised in this country and other parts of the Empire, and for the Home Government to assume direction of the operations and financial responsibility* 4. Before the Anglo-Afghan war of 1919 Afghanistan’s foreign relations were, at any rate in theory, and as a result of certain treaty provisions, controlled by the British Government, and this control, so far as it existed in praotioe, ms exercised through the Government of india as agent of His Majesty’s Government. The Amir also received a large annual subsidy from Indian revenues. In Afghanistan, as elsewhere in Asia, the Great rVar resulted in a stimulation of national self-consciousness. The Afghan Government resented ther position of fceoretical subordination to the Government of India, and as a result of the recognition of Afghan independence in the Anglo-Aighan Treaty of 1921 they gained the right to direct diplomatic relations with His Majesty’s Government and the governments of other foreign lowers. Since that date Anglo -Afghan relations have been conducted in the normal way through diplomatic representatives in Kabul and London; the annual subsidy has ceased, ana allcontrol of the Afghan Government by or through the Government of India has come to an end* l.everthelese the Government of India have continued to be financially responsible for all peace-time expenditure, i*e* (a; regular exj^enditure on the British Legation and consulates, and (b) any additional expenditure incurred in the interests of Afghan stability and friendly relations with this country. 5. The regular annual expenditure under head (a) amounts approximately to Hs.4.45 lakhs a year. That under head (b) naturally varies from year to year. although in the altered conditions resulting from Afghan independence an annual subsidy is no longer paid, nevertheless, in view of the British and Indian interests referred to above, and in accordance with recoirimendations made by the Defence of India Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. in 1927, a policy of occasional subsidy to promote projects of mutual benefit has been followed. This is sometimes referred to as the policy of ''subsidy in kind”. S-^nce the establishment of direct relations in 1922, additional payments under head (b) above (all from Indian revenues) have averaged a little over Rs.4 lakhs a year. By far the greater proportion of this expenditure, however, was incurred in a single year - 1931-2 - when, as a result of the emergency created by the Afghan revolution and the desirability ofhelping to stabilise the new regime, 10,000 rifles and also about £175,000 in cash wore supplied to fladir Shah. 6. The Government of India are prepared, though with some reluctance, to continue to finance this additional expenditure on a scale comparable to that already incurred. But they feel that it is only equitable (especially having regard to the dual object - Imperial as well as distinctively Indian - which this expenditure serves) that some limitation should be placed on their future /-^—1* — 1 4. future liabilities under this head. They consider that it is necessary that they should be able to calculate with some decree of certainty the maximum amount of expenditure of this nature to which they will be -committed in any given year, as it is important in present circumstances that they s hould not be faced with heavy unexpected expenditure under this head in any particular year which would impose a severe strain onthe Indian Exchequer, burdened as it is already with the heavy costs of Defence. 7. The Government of Iindia therefore propose to set aside a fixed annual sum for the purpose of ,T subsidy in kind' to Afghanistan from Indian funas in audition to bearing the annual expenditure under head (a) above. They propose to fix tills annual appropriation at He*5 lakhs a year (i.e.xaore than the average of the past 13 years/. The balance of this annual appropriation over the actual expenditure in any one year would be taken t,o reserve, where it would accumulate up to a maximum of Ks. £5 lakhs, this high maximum of the proposed reserve being allowed for the purpose of |rovid-.ng against emergencies such as that of lS£l-2. as a corollary of the establishment of this special fund the Government of India would naturally expect that in future, if expenditure which could not be met from the fund were required on some object of policy in relation to Afghanistan which both His Majesty’s Government and the Government of india agreed was desirable, its incidence would form the subject of discussion between the two Governments, which would proceed on the ir esumption that India had already, by the voluntary establishment of the special fund, fulfilled her own obligations in respect of additional expenditure of an ordinary kind; and the Government of India would therefore trust that, in the event of further expenditure (beyond the capacity of their fund) being required, the case for its being borne or shared/shared by His iiajeaty^ Goverraaent would be favourably considered, especially if its object was primarily to counter some specific danger of Russian penetration in Afghanistan.-—: — INDEXED ecf/bhb/mb (COPIES CIBCOIiAIED) \: J m /i « | 1 167/L ( 171 (grouj^OP ^ D E C YP H E B OF T B L E a B AM Prom 1370 SECRET , C\- Jt U GoTermaent of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India 0 Dated New Delhi, 7th March, 1936 0 Received 9 pem 0 , 7th March, 1936 0 _ 6E4&lt; FIRST OF TWO PARTS 0 * 3 f^' XXX BtOo.

My telegram No.8 of January 23rd. Afghan purchase of arms from Germany, second paragraph. 2. General as opposed to local considerations are as follows:- Germany is forbidden by Article 170 of the Treaty of Versailles to export arms, munitions and war material of every kind. German Government have announced that they do not intend to observe part of treaty to which this article belongs and it would no doubt be useless in practice to try to prevent export of war material from Germany, especially to countries like Afghanistan which are not parties to the treaty; but His Majesty’s Government have never admitted that German Government were entitled to make above announcement, which has, in fact, formed the subject of a condemnatory resolution by League Council. 3. Anglo-Afghan Treaty of course imposes an obligation on the Government of India to allow transit of arms consigned to Afghan Government without questioning their origin. If the German deal went through, therefore, question cf some difficulty might arise as to whether, because of that treaty, we should pass sub silentio a breach of Germany’s obligation under Article 170 of Treaty of Versailles, to which India is a party. In these circumstances you should if possible avoid further discussion of the subject with your German colleague and should/r-v should in any case express no view on the probable attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards imports of arms from Germany into Afghanistan.p.Z.774/36. \ SECIii^T Cypiier telegram addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul, repeated to Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department, dated 5th February, 1936. Ho. of words 15. XXX 12. Katodon Ho.9 of 31st January. Vickers. I approve your proposal to discuss the question with Afghan prime Minister.V 'y 11 I took over to-da.y to Mr. Walton at the India Office a copy of the record of the Secretary of State's con versation with the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs on February 1st, and asked him, with reference to the last paragraph of that record, what I could say tomorrow to the Afghan Minister about the supply of arms. Mr. Walton showed me a telegram which had just arrived from Colonel Fraser-Tytler (N 644/593/97); and we agreed that, in view of that telegram!, I could say to the Minister that, as a result of instructions sent on December 19th, Colonel Fraser-Tytler had resumed negotiations for the sale of the remaining 10,000 out of the first batch of 15,000 rifles, but had telegraphed on February 1st that he was still without a reply to his proposals on that subject. As soon as this question had been settled, however, it would be possible to consider the supply of another 15,000 rifles, making 30,000 in all* As regards the aeroplanes, I could say that v/e were already exploring this question, which (as the Secretary of State had pointed out) was particularly difficult, and would continue our investigations as quickly as possible and see v/hat, if anything, could be done. As regards mountain guns, we understood that the Afghan Government had already approached Messrs. Vickers, and we were now considering whether the firm should be advised to send a representative to Kabul to discuss the matter further in the Spring. (Signed) L. COLLIER. 3rd February, 1936. [Seen by Sir R. Vansittart]. After/After receiving instructions from Sir R.Vansittart I saw the Afghan Minister this afternoon and spoke as above. The Minister said that he understood the position about the rifles and about the aeroplanes, and v/ould so report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As regards the mountain guns, he had not heard of the negotiations with Messrs. Vickers; and in any case he thought that Faiz Muhammad* when he spoke of them, had supposed that His Majesty’s Government had some surplus old-pattern guns for sale in the same way as they had rifles. I said that I thought it most unlikely that this was the case; but I would make further enquiries. The Minister then said that he hoped Faiz Muhammad had made it quite clear that both in this matter and in that of a credit to the Afghan National Bank (see para graph 7 of the draft despatch to Kabul), his Government were approaching His Majesty’s Government«for a continua tion of the assistance which they had received since the days of King Amanullah and for which they felt themselves to be even more suitable recipients than were the Govern ment of that monarch, and that what they hoped to hear from us was that we were ready in principle to give them this sort of assistance. In the case of the credit to the Bank, for example, if a direct Government credit to the London branch of the bank (not an export credit to a British firm) could be granted in principle, they would not mind so much if it were only half the £500,000 for which they had asked or even if it were as low as £100,000, though, of course, the less it was, the fewer the goods which could be bought with it. I said that the whole question would be gone into as soon as possible. I could say no more than that at present/—' rat '■ ' i • present, as I really did not know what, if anything, could he done to meet the Afghan Government’s wishes in such matters. In connexion with the sale of rifles Sir R. Vansittart wishes us to emphasise that, as these are the one kind of military equipment of which we have large stocks and cannot easily dispose of them, and as we may find it difficult to meet the Afghan Government’s wishes in other matters, we should not haggle unduly over the price or the terms of payment, if the Afghan Government cannot accept our present terms. I think the India Office would agree with this view. (Signed) L. COLLIER. 4th February 1956.

Draft telegram to Kabul giving information of Faiz Muharrmad’s discussion of this question in London, and dealing with the nuestion of the first instalment on 5,000 rifles already supplied, which apparently has not yet been received. Previous Papers 1140 1000 8.32Minute Paper. Department. 3939 5000 7/35 It will be remembered that the Afghans have asked for 30,000 rifles in all. Five thousand, with airman it ion, were supplied from India last August, and are to be paid for in six yearly instalments, the first of which was due on or before 1st February, 1936. Negotiations have been proceeding for the supply of 10,000 from War Office stocks in this country; a dispute between the G. of I. and H.M.G. as to which Govt, should bear the liability of a default on these was at length settled by the Treasury accepting this liability provisionally, and pending a settlement of the general question of expenditure on Afghanistan (regarding which we are now in consultation with them). The British Minister at Kabul was accordingly instructed m a telegram of 19th November ( P.Z. 8333/35), subject to the concurrence of the G. of I., to resume his negotiations for the sale of 10,000 rifles (and of ammunition which the G. of I. are willing to supply on certain terms); and (after a further dispute between the W.0. and the G. of I. - regarding the distribution of receipts in the event of a default - had been disposed of) he was definitely instructed m a telegram of 19th December (P.Z. 8893/35) to proceed with his negotiations. It will be seen from Kabul telegram of 8th February at P.Z. 974/36 that Col. Fraser-Tytler discussed the question with the Afghan Prime Minister on 19th December, and that on 7th February the latter informed him that Faiz Muhammad had been instructed to carry on discussions in London and asked for information as to their progress. Part of Faiz Muhammad’s conversation with Mr. Kden/^ M*-'' — / hn- c/cv-&gt; UnyS ;74 Eden on 1st February (the full record of which is being submitted on a separate file) dealt with the question of munitions. The gist and result of that discussion were t as described m the draft telegram which is submitted. Faiz Muhammad asked for a reply in the course of the next few days as to H.M.G.’s attitude in principle to the • renuest for a farther suoply of 15,000 rifles. Mr. Collier and I agreed that the best answer to this was to say that question this^could be considered when the question of the 10,000 rifles already under negotiation at Kabul had been settled. The G. of I.’s telegram of 8th February at P.Z. 973/36 presumably refers to the first instalment due on the 5,000 rifles, it seems incredible that the Afghan Govt, should not mean to pay this while they are in negotiation with us for 25,000 more rifles; and it is difficult to suppose them so stupid as to think that by withholding payment they will expedite the disposal of their further requests (since exactly the opposite is likely to be the case); the matter can be best dealt with as in para. 5 of the draft telegram. I consulted Mr. Collier on this draft in my letter to him of 10th February, and the F.0. have telephoned that they concur. i fyjA in***-Eden on 1st February (the fall record of which is being submitted on a separate file) dealt with the question of munitions.

The Afghan Minister called at this department on February 4th to pursue further some of the questions discussed with me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (see rny despatches Nos. 16 and 17 of the 5th February)* 2* As regards the supply of arms to the Afghan Government, which was the first subject to be discussed, Mohammad Ali was told, in view of your telegram No* 9 of the 31st January, that you had resumed negotiations for the sale of the remaining 10,000 out of the first batch of 15&gt;000 rifles but had telegraphed on February 1st that you were still without a reply to your proposals on that subject. As soon as this question had been settled, however, it would be possible to consider the supply of another 15*000 rifles, making 30,000 in all. 3. As regards the supply of aeroplanes, the Minister was informed that His Majesty f s Government were already exploring this question, which, as I had pointed out, -was particularly difficult, and would continue their investigations as quickly as possible to see what assistance, if any, could be afforded. As regards mountain guns, it was understood that the Afghan Government had already approached Messrs. Vickers, and His Majesty’s Government were now considering whether that firm could be advised to send a representative to Kabul, to discuss the matter further inthe Spring. k» Mohammad Ali said that he understood the position about the rifles and about the aeroplanes and would so report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As regards the mountain guns, he had not heard of the negotiations with Messrs. Vickers and in any case he thought that Faiz Mohammad, when he spoke of these guns, had supposed that His Majesty’s Government had some surplus old-pattern guns for sale in the same way as they had rifles. He was informed that it was most unlikely that this was the case, but that further enquiries would be made.-'tt: (P.Z. 927/35) Extract from F.O. despatch to H.M. Minister, Kabul, Mo. 17, dated 5th February, 1936. 3. Faiz Muhammad then said that, as he had told me on January 30th, he now wished to deal with some economic questions; and the first and most important of these was the question of the supply of arms to his Government, which was both economic and political. When Sir Richard Maconachie was British Minister at Kabul, the Afghan Government had asked through him for 30,000 rifles for their army; and His Majesty’s Government had agreed last year to supply 15,000 rifles, 5,000 of which had now been received. The balance of 15,000 rifles was still urgently needed, however, and he asked me to use my influence to secure that these were supplied as soon as possible. His Government also wished to purchase twenty four aeroplanes, and at least one battery of mountain guns as a sample of future consignments. The Russians and others were offering them arms; but they were anxious to buy from this country if possible, and they recognized the force of the argument that they would be better able to resist a Russian attack if their arms and munitions were interchangeable with those used in India. Their army, however, must be built up quickly and could not wait indefinitely for the necessary equipment. 4. I replied that I would look into these matters as soon as possible and with every desire to help the Afghan Government. These requests, however, came at a time when we were engaged in building up our own defences and when we were inundated with similar requests for help from other countries - articularly in the matter of aeroplanes. I understood moreover lat it had been necessary for the interested Departments of is Majesty’s Government to go very carefully into the icidence of the risk involved in the fact that the rifles already/already supplied were to be paid for by instalments continuing over six years or so, not because they had not complete trust in the Afghan Government’s determination to honour their obligations, but because these deferred payments always involved a risk of default through force ma jeure « XXX 9. Faiz Muhammad then took his leave with expressions of pleasure at his reception in London, but emphasising the urgency of a decision on his Government's requests for arms. He was anxious, he said, to know His Majesty's Government's attitude towards this request - in principle, at least - before he left Pans on February 4th; and I told him that, while it was very difficult to settle these matters in a hurry, I would do my best to see that he had some answer by that date, through the Afghan Minister in London.COPY OF (Z3&gt; SECRET iT/toi, (115 groups.)

Bourianek is so busy that he has engaged a lady typist from Teheran. She has arrived in Peshawar. 31. M.

ARTS, AI.] UN IT ION AI^ID AlRGRiiFi 1 f rO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. In October 1933 the Afghan Government told Sir R. Maconachie that they needed arms, ammunition and aircraft. They asked whether H.M.G. would sell them these for payment m instalments. The Cabinet considered this question in 1 arch 1934 and decided in principle that we should agree to the request if the Government of India, on receiving information regarding the Afghan requirements and the method of payment, agreed to the sale and were able to supply the munitions desired. Sir R. Maconachie was instructed to enquire what the Afghan requirements were and what basis of payment they proposed. For a long time, however, the Afghans did not pursue the question, as they were considering whether to re arm their troops with .303 rifles (the bore used by British troops) or with some other bore. But in January 1933 they asked for 30,000 .303 rifles and 24 aircraft, to be paid for in instalments. 2. The consideration of these requests has been much delayed and rendered extremely difficult by a claim which the Government of India have put forward that 11.1 .G. should relieve them of some part of their present responsibility for extraordinary expenditure in respect of Afghanistan. Pending a settlement of their claim, which is being discussed with the Treasury, the Government of India have now declined to enter into any further financial commitments. 3. ''/hen, however, in July the Afghan overnment drew attention to their request and urged the desirability of a portion of the rifles reaching/reaching Kabul before the Independence celebrations on 16th August, m order to impress the tribesmen visiting Kabul on that occasion, the Government of India were persuaded to send therr, in the special and urgent circumstances, 5,000 rifles from their mobilisation reserves and 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition, for which the Afghan Government undertook to pay £60,000 in six annual instalments. Subsequently an offer was made to the Afghan Government of 10,000 1914 pattern rifles, drawn from surplus $ar Office stocks. 7/e are prepared to sell these rifles for £32,750, a price which would cover an individual inspection and a firing test. The Afghan Government accepted this offer in September, and asked to be allowed to pay for the rifles in six annual instalments. The question was then held up by discussion between the Government of India and h.M.G. as to which Government should carry the financial liability in the event of a default: at Iasi, the ireasury agreed to do so provisionally. Colonel ^raser-Tytler was instructed on 19th December to resume his negotiations for the sale of the lu ,000 rifles and to press strongly for a reduction in the number of instalments to three, or, at the most, four. He was also instructed to offer 6,000,000 rounds of ammunition ' ‘ (from India) in six annual instalments and naid for one /% year in airear. It is not possible to make any progress regarding the further 15,000 rifles (with ammunition) and the question of supplying aircraft pending a settlement of the question of liability as between n.L.U. and the Crovemment of India for extraordinary/extraordinary Afghan expenditure. 4. If Faiz iluharamad should enquire the reason for the over long delay in dealing with this question, it seeras undesirable to inform him of the dispute regarding incidence of cost between the Government of India and H.b.G. The only course seems to be to apologise for the delay, explain that unusual and difficult financial and technical questions are involved, especially as it is not in accordance with the practice of H.M.G. to sell things on credit, but that these questions are under examination and meanwhile, on 19th December, we instructed our i.mister to resume negotiations regarding the 10,000 1914 pattern rifles (with ammunition).(M SALE OF ARMS, AMMU1TITION ALT) AIRCRAFT TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. In October 1933 the Afghan Government told Sir R.Maconachie that they needed arms, ammunition and aircraft. They asked whether H.M.G. would sell them these for payment in instalments. The Cabinet considered this question in March 1934 and decided that we should agree to the request if the Government of India, on receiving information regarding the Afghan requirements and the method of payment, agreed to the sale and able to supply the munitions desired.

No. 124* Your telegram 10th December, Ho. 3295* Pooling arrangement described in my telegram 28th November, 3806, seems quite likely to turn out favourably to India rather than otherwise. Adjustment v/ould be in favour of His Majesty’s Government if Afghan default occurred in interval between 1st February next and time of receipt of first instalment due to His Majesty’s Government. But this at present appears improbable and when once His Majesty’s Government have begun to receive instalments, the arrangement, so far as I can calculate, would probably result in adjustment in favour of Government of India, in view of the provision stated in last sentence of my telegram No. 3806, because out-of-pocket expenditure there referred to will not exceed £ 10 , 250 . 2. In any case point has little importance compared with desirability of early resumption of negotiations with Afghans for sale of the rifles and ammunition. If therefore notwithstanding the above explanation you still prefer the arrangement stated in last sentence of para. 3 of my telegram of 19th November, No. 3720, His Majesty’s Government will substitute this for the revised understanding. In thatevent for the purpose of proportional distribution of any subsequent Afghan payments the amount of default to His Majesty’s Government will be reckoned as the full purchase price of the 1S2-4 pattern rifles not paid for at the time of the default. 3* His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, can therefore in any case proceed at once with his pending negotiations.FCW/vffi (COPIES CIKCULATED) ( ?7 groups 0 ) PECYPHEH OP Iff L E G R AJJL_ Prom GoTernment of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of .State for Indiao Dated New Deliii, ICth December, 1935&lt;, Receired 3 peffio, 10th December, 193o 0 XXX 3S95o Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Kabul, 407&lt;, Your telegram of the 29th ultimo, 2806 o We see no reason why payments already credited to either GoTernment prior to any default should come into calculation® We are, therefore, unable to agree to understanding ae now proposed® Subsequent resumed payments would be shared between the two parties on principles agreed in our telegram (corrupt group)® For this purpose, pari passu and pro rata may be understood to mean the allocation of each resumed payment in proportion to the amount of default to dace in respe t of each party®(COPIES CIH3ULATED) JK JL . 8579 1955 j (60 groups) 6238 (S-So ) SECRET 2..£_Q_JLZJL e» J SLE Prom ■l..

His Majesty’s Government note that Afghan Government state that they could only buy on deferred payments, and that they suggest six equal annual instalments.

You should also press for payment of the first instalment to be made on receipt of the rifles. Please report replies of Afghan Government on these points. 3 o por your own information, His Majesty’s Government attach importance to shortening the period of payment because, though these rifles do not constitute a very important item in their reserve, their supply involves immediate expenditure of upwards of £10,000 in reject of freight/.i ^r-ny ~°rr ■ » ■ ■■iy *4 - 2 - freight, inspection and test, and payment under agreement to Messrs.

This risk is at present slight and, in any case, if we refuse to supply ; munitions will probably be purchased elsewhere.

I shall he glad of your views on policy of supplying a further 15,000 rifles. Does desirability of supply from point of view of good relations with Afghanistan outweigh disadvantage of possible friction caused by Afghan Government owing us too much money? You will appreciate that the greater the quantity of munitions supplied on credit, the more difficult does it become to finance other forms of assistance to the Afghan Government which might possibly be of greater mutua1 benefit. 3 . if it is decided to make the further supply of rifles one course might perhaps be to agree to do so alter a period of say 18 months for instalments payable over a term of say three years? 4. Please also telegraph your views regarding the request for 6 million rounds ammunition. In view of liability of ammunition to deteriorate, would it be feasible to negotiate an agreement whereby we undertake to supply so much ammunition per year?

Proposals in your telegram No.2475 of 14th September are undur examination but it is inevitable that their discussion must take a considerable time. Meanwhile it appears essential to givj very early ropier to Afghan requests for munitions. It is especially necessary at a time when reactions of Mohmand compaign may place a strain on Afghan co-operation with us on irentier matters that we di ould not now after long discussions appeal reluctant to provide Afghan Government with munitions. There is also the danger that they may turn elsewhere. They have expressed wish to accept our oiler of 10,000 rifles and only question of method of payment remains for settlement. They have already aited without o. reply regarding aeroplanes for over seven months. It is desirable also to give a rcjjly soon to their request for 6,000,000 rounds of ammunition. 3. I observe however that proposals in paragraph 6 of your telegram No.2475 are conditional on His Majesty’s Government undertaking liability defined in paragraph 5. I am afraid that this would make it impossible to give any replies to the Ai^han requests for some time. I hope however/■ 5 mmm mmmgm 'V &lt;2? however that in circ‘Uinstances set out in paragraph 2 you will apree no give in respect oi 10,000 riiles indemnity suggested in paragraph 4 oi my telegram 2364 without prior settlement os large issues raised in your telegram 2475. 1 suggest that question oi ultimate liability lor Aighan deiault in respect of any aeroplanes and additional ammunition provided by Government oi India should similarly be reserved lor decision as part oi settlement oi general • uestion oi division oi responsibility as between His majesty’s Government and Government oi India for extraordinary expenditure m Aighanistan. 4.

If you reel it impossible to undertake contingent liability in respect of 5(d), we might try to postpone definite reply to Afghan Government on this point until general question is settled.

Cypher Telegram addressed hy Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs to H.M.Minister, Kabul, No. 75, repeated to Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, dated 23rd August, 1935. (422 words) XXX Katodon, No. 77 of 31st July. 2. Statement in Small Arms Book referred to in Government of India’s telegram of 29th July No. 1896 is misleading. 1914 pattern rifle was originally designed to take a cartridge with a bullet of .276 calibre. When however it was decided to substitute the .303 cartridge it became necessary to put a lining into the magazine in order that it might take the smaller cartridges. The only result of the alteration is that if the bolt is used in a slovenly manner a round occasionally sticks. 3« Please inform the Afghan Government in this sense. You may also say as regards guarantee of reliability that War Office regard these rifles as so satisfactory that they were considering a short tim© ago substituting them for the Short Lee Enfield Rifles now used in the Regular Army. Proposal was however turned down for other reasons. It may therefore be said that H.M.G. consider rifles to be reliable. As an additional safeguard the War Office recommends that each rifle should be given an individual inspection and also a firing test for accuracy of sighting. The additional cost of these tests would be 5s/6d. for each rifle, bayonet and scabbard of which 2s/6d. would be due for the firing test. In this connection statement of Afghan Prime Minister in Katodon No. 77 para. 3 about similar pattern rifles presumably refers to sale of some thousands of 1914 pattern rifles through/'through Fleming vis. Psi*is in These were t-sKen from the same stoc i l as now oiTereu hut they were not specially selected nor individually inspected before sale. 4. War Office are not prepared to give any particular or written guarantee with this type of rifle beyona emphasising its merits and suggesting additional safeguard of inspection. If by written guarantee War Minister means that if any of the rifles be found unsatisfactory by the Afghans amount paid for them would be refunded to Afghan Government, H.M.G. could not give such a guarantee even in respect of new rifles in view of impossibility of their being sure that after delivery to the Afghans they would be looked after as carefully as by British units. 5. Please telegraph your views on Government of India’s suggestion that some sample rifles might be sent for trial by the Afghans. War Office do not think it necessary to send sample rifles especially in view of the explanation and inspection offered in paragraphs 2 and 3. On the other hand they can despatch samples on payment oy the Afghans if it is thought that such a course would avoid any possibility of misunderstanding or recrimination. 6. It is clear that Afghans will not take old ammunition and for new stock the best source of supply would be India.SECRET FCN/CWP/UC/DIA (121 groups) 1935 4061 ^ - i i i rWL ^ w ■# DSCYPHER OF T £_L_E_G,B_ A_1L.

Please see para. 4 of telegram from Secretary of State for India to Government of India, 110.2190, dated 13th July. Supply of rifles to Afghan Government* In this connection please see also para, 2 of Porminka 57 of 5th July, 1934, para. 2 of Porminka 70 of 4th September and para. 3 of Katodon 101 of 26th September, 1934. 2. War Office have large stocks of unused 1914 pattern rifles which they could supply at price of £3 per rifle complete with bayonet, scabbard, oil bottle and pull-through, delivered at Karachi. War Office also have stcoks of .303 ammunition made during the War which they could supply at a price of £1.4.0 per 600 rounds delivered at Karachi. 3. Further particulars of the rifles and ammunition are as follows: Rifles, Magazine .303 M . PA914 E.H.A*—Mk ig .I. The rifles can be reckoned as unused weapons, having been made for the British Army during the war and only issued in small numbers to Home Defence Units. Host of the rifles have only fired the number of rounds necessary for inspection while the remainder can be taken as not having fired more than two or three hundred rounds. Rifles of this pattern were this year allowed to be used in the National Rifle Association competitions at misley and achieved much success. The2. The 1914 Pattern rifle is also, with the addition of the necessary fittings to tale a telescopic sight, the sniper rifle of the British Aimy. Ammunition , Cartridges , SmalJ- Arm. f Ball. • While, in view of the age of this ammunition, no guarantee can he given, recent reports show that the ammunition continues to 'behave in a reasonably regular manner* 4. Prom the Afghan point of view, supply of 10,000 of these units (rifle plus 600 rounds of ammunition) at a price of £4.4,0o per unit plus cost of transport from Karachi to Afghanistan would appear to he a much more attractive proposition than purchase of current pattern rifles from Indian stocks at a price approximating to cost quoted in para.6 (h) of Government of India’s telegram of 29th June, Ko.1586, which works out at nearly £11 per unit. Price quoted above is for cash on delivery, hut, even so, offer might he attractive to Afghan Government. If they cannot pay cash for 10,000 at once they might wish to purchase what they can afford now and the remainder at subsequent dates. I may add for your information that we understand that Afghan Government is already in negotiation through a French intermediary for purchase of such rifles from Messrs. Soley, and it seems highly probable that purchasing through such a channel they would have to pay a considerably higher cash price. If they can afford this they are perhaps the more likely to be attracted by our own offer also. 5. You should at once, in whatever manner you deem best, make offer to Afghan Government to sell 10,000 or any smaller number of these rifles on terns mentioned and ascertain whether they are attracted by the proposal, and are able to pa;y Cc«snon delivery for 10,000 at once or for smaller numbers gradually delivered over a period of time. 6. If however Afghan Government, while willing to take these rifles, profess to he unable to make any purchase except on deferred payment, it is desiraole to obtain information of their proposals. In this event, thereiore, you should discreetly ascertain what is the best basis of payment by instalments that they can offer, but you should noo at this stage commit His Majesty ’b Government to accepting payment by instalments as this question is still under consideration (see telegram Ho.2364 dated 27tn July, to Government of India).]? • Z • 500 5 /35.

Porminka 63. Supply of rifles to Afghan Government. 2. If offer which His Majesty's Minister has been instructed to make is accepted by Afghan Government, this will afford by far the least costly means of satisfying our political desideratum, viz: to meet their request for assistance in the interests of their internal security. Prom Indian point of view, this alternative seems also to have the advantage of avoiding any risk of a further depletion of India’s war reserves. 3. If Afghan Government having regard to low price offered, are able to pay cash for consignments as delivered, no difficulty will arise. 4. If, however, they press for payment by instalments, it seems probable that, having regard to the disparity in price, they may be able to offer a much more favourable basis of deferred payments than the six-year basis offered to the Government of India. Any basis of deferred payment, however, would involve a liability on His Majesty’s Government which (in view especially of the fact that an unpaid claim on the Afghan Government would have to appear in the appropriation account) they are reluctant to undertake pending a decision on general question of incidence of charges for measures calculated to assist Afghan Government.We trust therefore that in event of deferred payments 'being proposed and agreed to, Government of India would he willing (pending a decision on this general question and without prejudice to the decision) to agree to indemnity His Majestyfe Government in respect of any loss incurred through delivery of rifles in advance of payment and eventual default of payment at due date# You will observe that this contingent liability would be very much smaller than that incurred by sale of 10,000 of the more expensive rifles from your war reserves on deferred payments spread over six years. 5. I would be glad if you could let me have a reply on point raised in paragraph 4 above when once Fraser-Tytler has ascertained from Afghan Government whether they are attracted by our offer, whether or to what extent they can pay cash, and what is the best oasis of deferred payment that they could accept. When this information is available it will be possible to calculate more accurately the extent of the contingent liability (if any) involved.P.z. 5005 / 35 . SECRET.

On consideration of their position in light of new financial burden imposed on them by Quetta, Government of India felt very strongly on point of incidence of cost and on their side agreement to defer decision on this point was due to desire to contribute to solution of immediate problem confronting both Governments.

Details of the procedures, including examples of examiners' marks, and a sketch of the packing crates used, can be found at folios 262, and 234-238.Prior to sale, the War Office had undertaken to perform firing tests on all the rifles for an additional charge. These tests were not conducted, and the file contains correspondence between the India Office and the War Office, discussing the best options for presenting this fact to the Afghan Government, options for conducting the tests or reducing the price of the order, and the potential damage that would be caused to Britain's reputation, and Anglo-Afghan relations.The correspondence also concerns complaints by the Afghan Government that a number of rifles were damaged in transit or badly corroded. It documents the disagreement between the War Office, India Office and the Government of India over the provision of replacement rifles and parts, and contains details of the eventual arrangements and final agreement with the Afghan Government (found at folios 117-122).The file includes dividers which give lists of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
