Owing to the exceptional nature of the under taking Their Lordships are not in a position to commit themselves to a definite estimate of the probable cost of the scheme. so far as can be judged on the basis of estimates prepared locally, the total cost will be in the neighbourhood of £85,000. The Secretary, H.M. Treasury, S. i # 1.X (&amp;) possible date, and that ha would regard a deferment of the evacuation until the autumn (i*e. after the hot weather in the &amp;ulf) as inadvisable. From the Naval point of view it is desirable in the interests of the health and well-being of the personnel that if the old base at Hen^ats has to be evacuated before the hot weather commences,the new base at Bahrein should be well advanced. It has been necessary to defer a final decision until quite recently, in order to afford Their t Lordships an opportunity of fully examining the various possibilities of providing accommodation in replacement of that at Henjam. la these circumatancee Their Lordships regarded the early commencement of work at Bahrein as a matter of urgency, and They have, with the semi-official concurrence of your Department, authorised the commence- aent of woric at Bahrein under the conditions laid down in the telegrams of which copies are enclosed. 5 * * a®* therefore, to request that you will move the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to give Their formal sanction to the expenditure necessary for the development of a small naval base at Bahrein and for the provision of minor facilities at Khor fuwai on the lines stated. Their Lordships consider this eervice is of such urgency that it would be detrimental to the public service to postpone it until provision can be made for it in the ordinary course. 10. The expenditure in the current financial year will be negligible. Proposals for meeting the expenditure which will fall on 1935 Votes will be forwarded later. 11. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Foreign Office and India Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, / 8( (D u 4. Having regard to the fact that the .Estimates had already been settled and printed before a decision to proceed with the project could be taken. Their J^ordshipe have been unable to make provision for this service in the Estimates for 1955* Moreover, They understand that the Foreign Office hold the view that it would be impolitic for any public announcement to be made of the building of a new base at Bahrein until the Persian &gt;' t Government has been informed, through the diplomatic channel, of our intention of evacuating the existing base on the Persian island of Henjam. h. Their Lordships anticipate that the Vote 10 expenditure at Bahrein will not exceed £20,000, and that the work will not therefore come within the category of a work of magnitude. Should this anticipation prove to be incorrect, Their Lordships will bring the matter to the notice of Parliament as soon as the exigencies of the political situation will permit them to do so. fh® Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will be aware that the Secretary of State for India has already consulted the Government of India, with a view to ascertaining whether that Government are prepared to make a contribution towards the capital cost of the scheme, in addition to continuing to bear responsibility for the cost of maintenance and of providing the necessary personnel for the base. If any contribution towards the capital coat is received, it will be credited to appropriations in aid and will pro lanto reduce the net liability falling upon Navy Votes. 7.

Staff Officer Intelligence, Colombo. Political Resident, Bushire* _ Political Agent, Bahrain. No*1232 (G.M.T.) Dated and received the 13th April l£935. Persian Gulf Division anchored in KHOR KHALIYA today 13th April. White Ehsign has been hoisted with ceremony. -Senior Naval Officer*No. c/ 'y of 1352 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, Dil Haj, 26. 1352 April, 11, 1934 From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my demi-official letter No. c/l05 dated November 9, 1933, regarding the acquisition of certain land in the district of Jafair and to inform you that the government of Bahrain has now completed the purchase of all the privately owned land within this area. I enclose a plan of the area and a list, (No. 1) showing the owners of the private property, the approximate area of their land, particulars of buildings and gardens, and the amount of money paid to them by the govern- ment as compensation. The total sum is Rs 36,415/-. ' 2. There remains a large portion of open land within the area which is presumed to be the property of the government though it is probable that Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa will claim that it belongs to him when he returns from Cairo. If such a claim is raised it may be necessary for the BahrainBahrain government to satisfy Shaikh Mohammed by paying to him the price for which the open ground to which he lays claim was estimated, but this in any case is a matter for arrangement between the Bahrain government and Shaikh Mohammed. 3. In my letter No. c/l05 I estimated that the cost of acquiring the whole area would be approximately Es 41,500/- of which Ss 8,816/- was the value of the open land owned by the government, and the remainder, Es 32,684/- was the value of private properties. I found it impossible to satisfy the owners of the land with the amount which I estimated. I made cash payments to them amounting to Ks 36,415/- as well as gifts of land which are described on the enclosed list. Owing to the necessity for having had to disburse a larger amount to the owners than the sum which I estimated only 5,085/- remains, if my original estimate is accepted, as payment for the land belonging to the Bahrain government. In my original estimate the value of this open government land was assessed at fa 8,816/-. 4. As it was impossible to satisfy the private owners with the payments mentioned in my list No. !, it was decided that in most cases the Bahrain government would give them pieces of land approximately the same area as the land which was taken from them. The Bahrain government has gifted to them the lands mentioned in list No. 2, which is enclosed. The approximate value of the land given to these persons as compensation amounts to fa 10,500/-.5. The final financial result of the whole transaction to the Bahrain government is as follows. I estimated that the area would be acquired for Rs 41,500/- of which Ks 8,816/- represented the value of the land owned by the government. Actually it was necessary to make cash payments to landowners of its 36,415/- leaving ks 5,085/- only, instead of ks 8,816/- to cover the cost of the government land. This represents a loss to the government of approxi mately ks 3,800/-. In addition to this the govern ment has been compelled to make grants of land to the landowners concerned whose value amounts to approximately Rs 10,500/-, so the total loss incurred by the Bahrain government in completing the transac tion is approximately Rs 14,300/-. 6. In my letter of 9th November I gave an approximate estimate for acquiring the whole area. I had no time at my disposal in which to examine the matter carefully. I did not inspect any of the houses or gardens as it was inadvisable to draw attention to the matter at that time. M y estimate was therefore a very rough one. 7. At one period during the negociations I obtained the services of three assessors, leading merchants who are well acquainted with land values, Khan Bahadur iibdul Aziz Kozaibi, Khan Bahadur Abdurrehman Ziani, and Haj Mohomed Tyeb Khunji. They examined one property which was estimated by me in my letter No. 105 at being worth Rs 10,600/-. They assessed the value at between Rs 20,000/- and Rs 25,GOO/-. I dispensed with the services of assessors and continued to deal with the owners themselves by bargaining.8. The whole transaction has been carried out in about six weeks which is a very short time in which to complete negociations of such magnitude. With longer time at my disposal it is possible that the properties could have been acquired at a lower cost. The landowners have been treated generously; they have undoubtedly received considerably more than the value of their properties and the general public is well aware of this. Any other course than the payment of a great deal more than the real value of the land would have made the government the subject of considerable odium and would have raised a storm of criticism. 9. A proclamation for one month was issued on ^7th Dil v aad calling upon persons claiming any rights within this area to file their objections. Ho objections were filed. The persons whose ownership was registered in the land department were dealt with as I have described above. 10. The question of fish traps remains, file purchase consists of the land shown on the enclosed plan, it does not include the sea and the foreshore which are the property of the government. Certain persons however, among them some of the landowners whose property has been acquired possess fish traps in the sea adjacent to the area which has been purchased. The fish traps are their property and they enjoy an income from them, fhe actual areas in the sea enclosed by the fish traps are the absolute property of the owners. Their title deeds give boundaries extending over Idige areas but it is the practice of the government to recognise boundaries of fish traps not as rightsrights of ownership over the sea included in such boundaries but only in so far as no other fish traps or buildings will be allowed to be constructed within the boundaries. The sons of Shaikh xibdul Rehman, owners of the house on the north east point of Jafair have applied to the Bahrain government for a written guarantee to the effect that if the catch of their traps is impaired by the build ing of jetties, piers or by constant coming and going of boats or launches that the traps shall be paid for at their present value. In my opinion this is a very reasonable request and I am arranging to have their fish traps assessed in case of the question being raised in the future. 11. ii.ll the title deeds acquired from the previous owners of this land are lodged in the Land Department of the Bahrain government. I should obliged if you would inform me as soon as possible what nature of document you require in this connection from the Government of Bahrain, whether an ordinary title deed should be issued or whether as exchange of letters is required. 12. The occupants of the houses end gardens have been informed by me that for the time being they can continue to reside in their houses end that they will be notified when the lend must be vacated.

Dated, Dil Haj, 26. 1352 April, 11, 1924. The adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Bahrain government has acquired the area shown in the enclosed plan in the suburb of Xozabia on the eastern coast south of Manamah. 2. proclamation was issued for one month on 13th Dil Vj 86d calling on any persons having rights within this ares to notify the Lend Department of the Bahrain government. ho appli cations were received but it was known to the government that two uersons owned land within the area described in the proclamation, both of these persons were absent from Bahrain. One large plot of land and a still larger piece of sea adjacent to the land was owned by Mahomed and Yusuf sons of Abdullah Behzad, Persian resident in Lingah and another — Ek &lt;s&gt; -another large piece of ground was owned by Khalifah bin Khamis, Bahrain subject, at present in Bombay* 3. The property of the Bahzads consisted of approximately 1050 x 300 feet of land along the shore and 1300 x 1050 feet in the sea. The amount of compensation for the land was placed at ks 5,000/- and this sum was sent to His Britannic Majesty^ Political ^gent, as the owners are concerned in judicial proceedings in the agency Court. The Bahzads also possess a large piece of ground on the coast outside the required area nearer to Manama!!. ^n area in the sea equivalent to the piece which was acquired from them is being allocated to them in the sea adjoining their other property. as this is nearer to Manamah it is more valuable. The whole piece, land and sea, which has s . been acquired from them was originally purchased by them for is 4,500./-. They have been paid Rs 5,000/- for the land and have been given an equivalent area of sea elsewhere. 4. Khalifah bin Khamis has been given an area of similar size to that which he owned on the southern edge of the land delineated in the enclose] plan. He will be compensated by a cash payment by the Bahrain government on his return for an artesian well ouilt upon his property and a hut and some stones. 5. Unfortunately the original title dee s of the Behzads have not been obtained from them. I suggest that before payment to them of the|MH| •T.T' ilMailllllllBIIIIIIIIIM ■■■■w '/ A A , « . i mm ^wm the Es 5,000/- they should be required to sur render their title deeds. The title deed of Ehalifah bin Khamis will be obtained when he returns and will be filei in the Land Department.

That practice is that dutiable articles for the personal use of officers and mn of his lajesty f £ Ships are allowed, to be Inportecl and retained customs free within the precincts of the special area or buildings set aside for their private use ashore. For f-' the details applicable to this general principle I would refer you to pages 174 to 178 inclusive, 181, 184, 1S5 and 190 to 200 of the Indian €u#t&amp;ise a Sea Customs Manual. 5. The details of the decision arrived at by you were that the following articles were to be lanaed duty free from Els if Jesty 1 s Ships under the conditions mentioned in the preceding paragraph: ( &amp; ) Alcoholic arid other drinks for exclusive consumption Id the men's canteen by Sav&amp;l ratings. An exception to this would be that a special license would be granted occasionally to the Canteen to entertain outsiders. (b) Office material and furniture including stationery.

C/362-5/7 of 20th April 1935. 3. i have not got a copy of the Indian Jea Customs annual and aa not acquainted with in the rules laid down/it* The Bahrain government has its own customs regulations which are not identical to customs regulations in other countries, moreover Bahrain is not, like India, a British possession but it is an independent state and its position vis a vis the British Navy differs from the position of India or any British possession, colony or protectorate. 1 think the Ilavy do not appreciate this distinction in tae matter of customs. I agree however that Bahrain should be guided by the usual practice, existing iu ports of other for©i fo u coun trie s. 3* It was agreed that an exemption from customs duty should 'be made in respect of imports of the following nature:- (a) alcoholic and other ariaxs and edibles for the exclusive consumption of the men's canteen.

His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad fully appreciates the present political advantages and the material advantages which it is hoped will accrue to Bahrain owing to the coming of the Mhvy, but one of these advantages w doh he looked forward to was an increase in revenue from customs duties which would affact him more directly. As you aware when he first heard that the Navy was costing he enquired whether he would receive some sort of payment or subsidy for their using Bahrain* I told him that this would not occur but that the public and trie govern ment would benefit in other ways, fours sincerely, g 7 .Person al Political Agency, Bahrain, the 39th May 1935. % dear Belgrave, Would you please refer to the Shaikh * s reply dated the 1st Saf&amp;r 1354 to my letter Ho*167/V*0 of the 22nd April 1935 concerning the question of charging customs; duty on Haval Btores - and our conversation on the same subject. 2. I have spoken to Captain Fisher, Senior Officer in the Persian U ulf, and am aware of the Kaval attitude, Eefore- proceeding further 1 wish to write to you privately to ascertain your views. As regards paragraph 7 of the Shaikh*s letter I explained to Captain Fisher (in consonance with our conversation) that by * building* the Shaikh meant ‘concession*, and that there was no objection to the sailors drinking in the gardens attached to the buildings* I do not propose to ask the Bnaikh to change the word * building* to a more comprehensive ord. Obviously ihie sailors drinking within the limits of the Naval Concession can offend no subject of Bahrain since none will be there to observe it. With this difference the whole of the Shaikh*s letter except paragraphs 9 and 10 is acceptable to and appreciated by the Royal Navv. .. 3. As regards paragraph 10. If the shaikh insists on customs on Government stores the matter will have to be referred to His Majesty’s Government, and it is certain that His Majesty’s Govern ment will never agree to examination of or payment of customs on Admiralty stores* 4* As regards paragraph 9. The Naval attitude is adamant also, and amounts to an insistence that ail furniture and in fact everything should be imported duty free. If the Shaikh insists, however, this question too will oe referred to his Ma '©sty’s /Government. Cv» Dairymple Belgrave Bsquire. Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.s Government• 5* I understand .that the Shaikh, who at first was delighted to find he had a Naval Station at Bahrain, has discovered from his relatives that the original decision must have been made without consulting him, and that a glorious opportunity to make money was lost. I am in no position to offer an opinion as to whether or not the Shaikh is entitled to monetary compensation or reward, hut of course should he feel he is I would naturally # forward his representation to the Honourable the Political Resident. I do not think such representation would meet with favour if the Shaikh does not give way to the Naval requirements. In any case I do not think such a request would meet with official favour. The official attitude would be that it unbecame one who owed his prosperity to his Treaty relations with Great Britain. The Shaikh I think without consulting you again wishes to approach the honourable the Political Resident direct on this subject. The Honourable the Political Resident has given m to understand teat he Ishes me to deal with the matter, and I think the Bhaikh would be better advised to be patient, and for the time being be content to deal with this particular subject through me. 6. hh&amp;t remains to be settled now is the course to adopt, and on that I should value your opinion: (a) . X can ask the Shaikh to come and see me, and ask him to withdraw paragraphs 9 and 10 of his letter. At the same time if necessary I would point out to him what I have set forth in paragraph 5 above. Should he refuse then I must refer the matter through the usual channels• (b) • I can give a copy of the 'Shaikh 1 s letter to the honour able the Political Resident who would then take such action as ne deems necessary. (e)• The course I like least, a compromise, which amounts to entertaining a request from the shaikh for a cash monetary reward for the facilities he has offered to the Royal Navy and In return for which he will valve all claims to customs dues. I am sure that His kajesty’s Government would take the view that the Rs.1,46,704/- he received from the sale of the lands was a very hand some reward, as these lands had little agricultural or building value. /My' mm ■■ • —7. My opinion is that it would be in the Shaikh*s best interests to accede to the davei requests, which would ensure the continuance of cordial relations. By listening too muon to avaricious relations he has allowed himself to forget what benefits Bahrain has had in the past and continues to en^Oy increasingly as a result of Treaty relations with Great Britain. I, therefore, prefer course (a) and the less I should have to point out to the Shaikh what he owes to British protection and assistance the happier I would be. 8. Although this letter is personal I have of course no objection to your using it as the basis for conversations with the Shaikh before replying to it.

In view of the obvious dissatisfaction of the Shaikh - or rather those who are in my opinion behind and the cause of his dissatisfaction I do not propose to reply to the Senior Naval Officer^ above quoted letter without reference to you. 5. I am of opinion that although the Shaikh has given way with rather bad grace he does not bear any ill will, and his letter does not reflect his true feelings but rather those of his relations. I therefore suggest that I should send him an acknowledgment expressing your gratitude, and inform the Senior Naval Officer briefly by demi-official letter that the Shaikh has granted the requests made in his above quoted letter.

This is one of the occasions, fortunately few. when the point of view of the Agency does not coincide with that of the Shaikh and when these occa.sions occur my position becomes rather difficult. 2. My personal opinion is that the Shaikh has not been treated too well over the whole question of the Naval base. I think he should have been told about it before It became a fait accompli, on the other hand I know that there were many political reasons for keeping him in the dark about it. I myself constantly urged that he should be informed and I assure you that at times I felt in a very inviduous position knowing ail about It and knowing that he never suspected anything. I am quite sure that he had no idea that the Navy intended to come here. When he was told about it his first reaction was pleasure but almost immediate ly he began to realise what had happened and then he was not pleased. I think you might give the Shaikh himself credit for realising, without being told by his relations, that the whole matter must have been settled long before he was told anything about it, admittedly his relations are usually quicker In the uptake than he is but in this case the thing was so obvious. His relations, Mohammed and Abdulla and Sulman w r ere really very indignant, not at the „Navy coming here but at the w ? ay in which it was done. Then there was the question of the flag staff at Jufair which caused a lot of feeling. The Shaikhs thought that permission should nave been asked before it was put up, the publ c assumed that the Shaikh 1 s non-appearance when it was hoisted at Jufair was a protest against it having been put up I without permission. It is difficult to convince the people here that such things are customary under such circumstances in other places, they just donH believe it.25 2 3. It was unfortunate, on the top of all this, that the question of free customs should have been raised, and that the Navy should find It Impossible to compromise. You are mistaken in thinking that the customs question is a matter of money, it . it a question of principle and as it is also a question of principle on the other side I can see no possible solution exceot that the weaker party, the Shaikh, should give in. This Is what he intends to do, when the Shaikh and Abdullah discussed the matter f they came to the obvious conclusion that as they did not wish and were unable to contend against the British Government the only thing w r as to submit. The way they look at it is that it is strange of the British Government to force them, for the sake of a few hundred rupees every year, to give up what they consider are their rights to take customs, after they have of their own accord waived these rights on almost everything which the Navy might import. 4. You mentioned the price of the land bought from the Shaikh. I think it should be known how that price was settled. In 1934 when the C-in-C came here I was suddenly asked to give a rough estimate of how much the land was worth. I think I had exactly one day in which to consider the matter, and of course the Shaikh was told nothing about it. There were records of previous sales of land in the immediate neighbourhood in the Land Depart ment and I collected them all and worked out as closely as I could a rough figure representing value per square yard based on the average of previous sales. This was an estimate but it was takne as being a definite undertaking to sell at that amount. The whole transaction was conducted entirely by me, the Shaikh never had any say in the question of price but if he had been given an opportunity of taking part in the deal he would have demanded at least twice as much, and presumably he would have got it. Shaikh Mohammed, who claimed most of «?ufair, still considers and always will consider that he was very badly treated because in his estimation Jufair is worth as much as all the /three3. three sites together. I wonder on what basis H.M.G w r ould take the view that the price of the lands was high. I should much dislike the matter of the land price being mentioned to the Shaikh as an argument about customs because he would almost certainly pomplain that he was given no opportunity of discussing the price and the price obtained was much less than the land was worth. He accepted the price because I told him that it was the price which the British Government were w-illing to pay but. if I f had told him that it was the price which I had assessed the land as being worth he would not have agreed. 5. The suggestion of a payment to the Shaikh for allowing the Navy to use Bahrain as a base would feav not have been made by him if I, on the day when he made it, had got an opportunity to talk over the matter with him. This had nothing whatever to do with the customs question and I know that the Shaikh did not at any time contemplate such a payment as being compensation for waiving customs duties. 6. The Shaikhis^hbw writing a letter to you, in connection with his previous one, agreeing not to take any customs on the imports referred to in his paragraphs 9 and 10. He Is doing this because I have strongly recommended him to take this line . I think at the same time you should know- that in my opinion, from the conversations which X have taken part in ?vith the shaikhs, when perhaps they sometimes rather forget that they are talking to an Englishman, the whole affair has been very strongly resented by the Shaikhs and it will give an opportunity to people here who dislike the British Government, and there are quite a lot who do, to say that the British Government has behaved badly to the Shaikh over the Naval base.V 16 lv° (Tfj Translation of a letter dated the 11th Rabi al Awwal 1554 (13th June 1935) from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa Al Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, to the r olitical Agent, Bahrain, n We underst nd from our Adviser that the British Navy will nt agree to pay customs duty to us on the imports mentioned in paragraoh 9 and 10 of our letter dated the 1st Safar 1953.

He understands that further claims for compensation are liKely, and suggests that the Bahrain Government should issue a proclamation calling for all such claims to he rendered within one month, after which date no further claims would he entertained. 2*- These claims for compensation are on account of the construction of a stone pier at the southern corner of the naval area. The pier projects about 100 feet, further seaward than the adjacent fish traps. 3.- The probability of complaints in this respect was realised before construction of the pier commenced, and for this reason culverts have been built into the pier. Although at present filled up, the stones could readily be removed if considered desirable. It was hoped that the opening of these culverts might result in reducing the amount of compensation paid. 4.- The position as described above was recently communicated to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies and approval was requested to adopt the Financial Adviser*s suggestion in paragraph 1 above. 5.- A copy of my telegram 0810 dated 26th June and of Commander-in-Chief«s reply (0758 of 30th June) are attached for information. ^ •? 6.- Judging from Colonel Loch*s No.c/413-7/l dated 19th April, paragraphs 10 and 13, it appears that foreshore rights, which include fish traps, were not obtained with the land, in fact, Colonel Loch states that he considers it wouldPage 2 i * NAVAL BASE, BAHRAIN - PROBABLE CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION BY FISH TRAP OWNERS.

I understand that these traps have not been valued so that the assessment of claims for compensation may be all the more tedious. 9.- I have no information as regards the particulars and amount of the claims paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Royal Air Force, but I presume that this is Known to the Political Agent, Bahrain, to whom a copy of this letter and enclosures is being forwarded. 10*— I should be grateful for your remarks on the legal position as outlined in para.5 above.

Similar claims were preferred when R.A.F. and Oil Company’s piers were built. Arbitration continued for about 2 years and considerable sums were paid in compensation.

Bahrain file No .7/1. , p .95. i do .no. ^ it p .117. tJJL . do p.102. ; - 7 ^ The general situation appears to be as follows: Before the pier was actually built there were various sites proposed which we can call A B and C all within, say, a mile or two of each other. The pier was finally built at a site which we can call C. In Colonel Loch’s letters Nos.C/413/7-1 of 19th April 1934 paragraphs 10 and 13 and No. C/457/7-1 of 28th April 1934 to me, copies to Secretary of State for India, it was stated that 5 fish traps belonging to the family of Shaikh Abdur Rahman would be affected by the pier and that compensation would have to be paid. At that period the pier was proposed to be made at sites A or B and the value of these traps was assessed at Rs.7600/-. The Secretary of State for India in paragraph 3 of his letter No.P.Z.2877/34 of 1st May 1934 accepted the proposals in Colonel Loch’s letters quoted above. Moreover in Shaikh Hamad’s letter of 16th April 1934,in which he formally ratified the sale of the land to His Majesty’s Government, he granted the use of the foreshore for building piers *tetc., but stipulated that any damage done to any fish trap belonging to his subjects should be compensated for. 2. Of the 5 traps belonging to Shaikh Abdur Rahman / ./ f-VV ^Bahrain file puc f L in fh*- kn&gt; Rahman Mr. Belgrave states, subject to further confirmation, that probably only 2 are affected by the pier in its present site at site C. He is unable to say without further enquiry what the value of the 2 particular traps affected is, but anyhow the balance of compensation assessed for the remaining 3 fish traps will be available for meeting the claims of the owners of new fish traps who are affected by the p&amp;er being built actually at site C. 3* The Senior Haval Officer in paragraph 10 of his letter No*23/0425 of 8th July 1935 asked my opinion as to whether the Admiralty or the Government is liable for compensation* This is really outside my sphere to answer, but it is indisputable that His Majesty's Government as a whole took on the liability for compensa tion and so some Government Department will have to stump up. However - vide paragraph 4 of India Office „ _ „ it would appear that f.Z* 2877/34 of 1st May 1934 -/the Admiralty will have to make good the loss. Belgrave suggested to the Senior Naval Officer that the Bahrain Government should put up a Notice, saying that all owners of fish traps who wished for compensation should put in their claims within one month from the date of the Notice, after which no claims will be considered* The Senior Naval Officer approved of this procedure and telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief - vide his No.884 of 26th June 1935 - that it should be carried out, but the Commander- in-Chief in his reply, No.931 of 30th June 1935, made ap no reference to this proposal, asked that my views may be obtained and seemed to be under the impression that perhaps compensation for fish traps could not be uphold against His Majesty’s Government.Mr.Belgrave informs me that the owners of are fish traps^alreafy putting forward claims. There are thus obvious advantages in having the Notice referred to above in paragraph 4 issued as soon as | possible. I Bahrain. |24/7/35. I 71 j c ‘l? »' M Telegram From To G.T.C.

No. 501/33. Time Copy* Bahrain, August 11, ’SS. Dear Cole, When Colonel Eowle discussed the Jufair fish trap question mth me during his last visit he asked me how many of the eight traps whose value had previously been assessed were affected by the pier. I replied that I could not say definitely but i thought probably about two were affected. He then sent a letter on the subject to, 1 think, the Admiralty. 1 now find that most probably claims for compensation for four or five of the eight fish traps will be made and those near the pier which are most affected are the most valuable ones. It will therefore be impossible to assume that the amount of money which the eight traps were assessed at will be sufficient to cover the compensation to owners of the other traps on the other side of the pier as well. I think perhaps this mistake should be corrected. Yours sincerely, Sd/ C. Dalrymple Belgrave. Captain G. A. Cole, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain.No. 1445-3/22. ,1 :,s&gt;7 *. firing)' Poli+^ical Agency, Bahrain, the 28th May 1936. From. Cap ta in T, Hie kinhotham, I. A., Jufair Fishtraps . Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of compensation to be paid to the owners and tenants of fishtraps, which have been damaged by the construction of the Haval pier at Jufair. 2. A plan of a trap is attached. The fish pass it on the incoming tide, enter the ’V* at high water and eventually are forced into the trap by the ebb tide leaving the mouth of the 1 V’ high and dry. 3. The principle of the payment of compensation was accepted and was safeguarded by r.(?1 His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin I£a A1 Khalifah, who made a proviso to that in his letter dated the 16th April 1934^4ff^vvhieh he agreed to the estab lishment of the naval facilities at Jufair. 4. A number of complaints and protests were received from the time that it became known that the pier would be constructed. In order to ascertain and assess the amount of compensation to be paid, the following L j. M - 2 - /1 following action has been taken: - (i) As the result of the correspond^rice ending w-^:. with a telegram ho.931 dated tne 30th June 1935 from His Excellency the haval Commander- in-Chief, the Bahrain Government v/ere requested to issue a notice (in the form usual in such cases) calling upon any owners of fishtraps who considered that their fishtraps had been damaged to submit representations on the' subject within one month. (ii) A committee of persons with expert knowledge ■*— of fishtraps was then appointed by the Bahrain Government to examine the complaints on the spot and to submit a report. (iii) On the 22nd April 1936 a meeting 1 : was held at —- the Agency of. the Senior°‘11aval Officer, Persian Gulf (Cqptain V.8. Butler), the Political Agent (Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch), and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave)/to consider the report in (ii) above. The Superintendent of the Land Department also attended as he was conversant with the subject (mentioned in paragraph 4(ii) above). 5. As the result of the meeting and of certain further enquiries, ma.de at our instance, v/e came to the conclusions set forth below. 6. A statement is enclosed showing the findings of the Expert Committee, as modified in some cases by the Bahrain Government and at the meeting mentioned in paragraph 4(iii) above, and the amounts of compensation which we recommend should be paid to the owners of damaged fishtraps. The amount of compensation has been based (except in the cases mentioned in paragraph 7 below) on ten years’ rental, which is the usual local custom in purchases of immovable property. 7 » Certain of the amounts (under Nos.1,2,4,5 and 8) are higher than the remainder. The reason is that at the time when the land was acquired for Government, certain owners. /&lt;£ - 3 - owners (the heirs of the estate of a man recently deceased) of land so bought owned fishtraps adjacent to their land and made the sale conditional upon the payment of compensa tion for the fishtraps, should they be damaged in the futurd, at the rates fixed by a Committee appointed by ■ ' m ^iiiHdimiinniiiiii- I. i the Bahrain Courts for the purpose of making a division ■■aw*— ijwiiiiiiwiiwjtx of the estate. These rates had been fixed well before there was any question of the purchase of the land by Government. It is, however, fortunate that the prices of fishtraps have since fallen and that the compensation of the other traps can be made at the lower rates now obtaining. 8. It is also necessary, in order to prevent grievances which would react unfavourably on our position, to pay compensation to the tenants of the fishtraps, who are poor people and have undoubtedly suffered financial loss (a) owing to the building of the pier on their fishing grounds during the time of their leases (b) owing to the fact that in future they will be unable to rent these sites which are in their neighbourhood and for which it is unlikely that they will be able to get substitutes elsewhere and (c) owing to expenditure on labour and material for the seasonal construction of the trap. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have, moreover, paid compensation to the tenants, as well as the owners, in the case of traps damaged by their pier at Sitrah, and the people will undoubtedly expect similar treatment at the hands of His Majesty’s Government. 9. Only two individuals are entitled to comnensation. The Bahrain Government have carefully investigated these two claims and consider that Rs.70/- (Rupees Seventy only) shouldt £0 /&gt; 3 - 4 I should be paid to Jumah bin Haji ’Abdullah of Ghraifa tenant of trap A1 Mushlakha and Rs.50/« (Rupees fifty only) to Wallah Abdel Hussein bin ’Abdullah al Ghrefi tenant It is desirable that the compensation to the tenants should be paid without delajr as they may make compensation over the period during which the question has been under consideration. people, and especially the poor, should have any grievance over losses sustained by the establishment of the naval base at Bahrain, as any such grievance would afford a valuable handle to mischiefmakers and this view is shared by the Senior Haval Officer and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. I hope, therefore, that you will feel able to recommend to His Majesty’s Government these proposals which have been framed with great care and consideration for economy. 11* A copy of this despatch is being given to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, His Majesty’s Ship Shoreham at Bahrain. of trap Al Tenazah.

In his letter under reference the Adviser to the Bahrain Government informed us that the particular fish trap in question had been leased for the season for Rs. 150/-. The Senior Naval Officer in his letter of the 23rd January 1937, No. 490/13, a copy of which is enclosed, stated that the remains of the fish trap in question had been satisfactorily removed. It appears that the fish trap which was known as Um Ratal was assessed for compen sation at two—thirds damage and this sum of money was paid. 3. The Senior Naval Officer appears to have mixed up the names of the fish traps as he has pointed out that the fish trap which has been causing him inconvenience i.e. Um Ratal has been completely removed, while at the same time the Adviser to the Bahrain Government states that it is still in use ano has been leased for the season. It appears to me that this particular fish trap is not causing inconvenience to the Naval authorities and that they would probably be unwilling2 f unwilling at this stage to complete the purchase. I suggest that we should refer the matter to the Senior Naval Officer and ask him whether the Naval authorities are now desirous of buying out the remaining one-third share in the Urn- Ratal fish trap.

The Honourable the Political Resident # in the Persian Gulf, Bushiri Subject Jufai r J'ish Trans * Sir, I have the honour to state that the Senior Naval Officer recently made a request that it should be arranged to complete the purchase of two fish-traps namely ’Urn Ratal 1 and ' Maqsusa*, since their existence interferes with service requirements. Both these traps were included in the list attached to my predecessor’s letter No. 1445-3/22 dated the 28th May 1936 ( serial numbers 2 and 4), and it will be noted that in regard to’Umm Ratal*it was stated that it has been whol^ly damaged. Subsequently it was reported that it had been damaged only to the extent of two-thirds and accordingly two-thirds compensation amounting to Rs 2666-10-9 was paid as compensation. ( r *Damage* , to fish- traps does not necessarily mean constructional damage but may - and usually does mean damage to utility by diversion of currents etc )• 2. The present position is that the owner of these two traps is anxious to reconstruct them, and that the Senior Naval Officer has the strongest possible objection Iimr—-Iimminr' wmi to this for service reasons. In these circumstances the only course open, in my opinion, is for the Admiralty to provide the funds required for the outright purchase of „ .. *. v, both traps. In the case of *Um Ratal* a further sum of Rs 1333-5-3 will be required ( this sum was actually refunded,2 vide my predecessor's No. 3137-3/22 dated the 26th November 1936) s and for’Maqsusa* a further sum of Rs 266/&lt; ^ill be needed. 3o Pending final settlement the owner of the traps has been forbidden to reconstruct them, but it is obviously desirable that the matter should be settled without delay© I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient seravnt IjIiJLjjl Political Agent, Bahrain# Copy to 1.
