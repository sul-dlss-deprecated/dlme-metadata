The Enclosure concerns a report from Baghdad that British vessels had intimidated people at Guttur [Qatar] and demanded payment of money on behalf of Saood [Saud ibn Faisal ibn Turki Āl Sa‘ūd, Amir of Najd]. Pelly states that the story was probably based on false reports of arrangements made in 1868 for the payment by Qatar of an annual subsidy to Bahrein [Bahrain], which formed part of a joint tribute paid to the 'Wahabee Ameer' [Amir of Najd]. The letter also encloses one from the Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, dated 26 October 1871, warning that the issue of sovereignty over Qatar, which arose from Pelly's letter, was one that should be taken up by the Foreign Office with the Ottoman Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Guttur</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100084589627.0x00000e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
