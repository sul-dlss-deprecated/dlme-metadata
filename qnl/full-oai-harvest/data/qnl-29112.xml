The enquiries relate to suspicions that the individuals may be German Agents and that their intended return to Muscat may be an attempt by the German Empire to make overtures to the Sultan of Muscat.The principal correspondents are the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (William George Grey, Frank McConaghey, and Robert Erskine Holland); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Percy Zachariah Cox); the Secretary of State for India (John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn); the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey) and representatives of the India Office and the Foreign Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><subject><topic>Diplomatic protection</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100026186803.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
