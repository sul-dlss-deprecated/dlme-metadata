The papers dated 1932-1934 discuss British concerns over moves to institute closer relations between Iraq and Kuwait, as well as smuggling, Pan-Arabism in the Gulf, and Ibn Saud's concerns over Iraqi ambitions. Papers dated 1938-1939 concern the status of Kuwait as an independent Shaikhdom under British protection, and apparent Iraqi desire to annex Kuwait. These papers include samples of propaganda published in a number of Iraqi newspapers, and summaries of broadcasts made by King Ghazi's broadcasting station, Qasr al-Zihour (folios 63-75).The correspondents are: the India Office Political Department; the Colonial Office; the Foreign Office; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Kuwait; and HM Ambassador to Iraq.The file contains dividers which give lists of correspondence references found in the file by year. These are placed at the end of the correspondence (folios 2-4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Ghāzī I</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Government</topic></subject><subject><topic>Borders</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000196#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000196#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000196#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000196#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000196#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
