The letter is concerned with acquiring the remaining amount owed to Hajee Yacoob, a dependent of the British Government, who lost the contents of his vessel to pirates. In his letter, the Prince states that the piracy was committed by subjects of Asseeloo [Bandar-e `Asaluyeh]. However, in his letter to Justin Sheil, Hennell writes that the piracy was in fact committed by inhabitants of the neighbouring district of Khirrah. The Prince's letter also refers to the twelve loads of raisins that the tribe of Boower Ahmed took from Yoosoof Malcolm.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000020#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
