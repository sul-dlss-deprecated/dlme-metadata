(1447/132/14) British Legation J edda 26th May 1933 Sir I am reporting in a separate despatch on the commercial position in regard to the wireless installation supplied to the Sa’udi Government by the Marconi Company in 1931-32. As there has been some confusion in earlier reports, ending with Mr. Hope Gill’s printed despatch No. 70 of March 3, as to the distribution of the wireless stations now in operation in this country, I take^ opportunity an up -1 - da t e . s ta t ement * The previous confusion has been due to departures from the plan made in 1931 and to a certain amount of transference of the older sets which were already in existence when the Marconi contract was concluded. Even now it is difficult to obtain exact information on all points but I believe the list given in the following paragraph to be as accurate as possible subject to the observations in the subsequent paragraphs. It is base( * ori the Sa’udi Government’s list enclosed to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 70 of March 3 9 on a list which appeared almost simu] taneously in the ’’Umm-al-Q.ura” of February 24 and on information from other sources. %af Kariyat), ^atif and Tabuk. i Kilowatt, mobile:- ’Uqayr, Dawadmi, Taif and one set to The following is my consolidated list:- Mew Hare oni Stations. 6 Kilowatt - Mecca, and Riyadh. i- Kilowatt, fixed Buraida, Hail, Hasa (Hofuf), Jedda,^*^, accompany the King Other The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, 0?C.3.I., K.C.V.O., • » etc*, etc etcOther Stations , provided wi for telegraphy only, with t set • - Abha, Al-Ula, (?) Dhaba, Jizan, Lith, Medina, Aunfida, Rabigh, (?) Babya, Skaka (Jauf), Wejh and Yanbu’, 3. A he bove list accounts for all the sets provided for in the Marconi contract, with the exception of one £ kilowatt fixed set, Mr, Philby tells me that this was erected at Riyadh, before the large station was built and that it is still there. 4, Mr, Philby also states that the set at 'Uqayr has been dismounted from its lorry and thereby cppverted into a fixed set. The station at Dawadmi takes/place of that which was contemplated at Sha’ara, Dawadmi is, according to the Handbook of Arabia, 409 miles from Mecca on the road to Riyadh and 15 miles beyond Sha’-ra, 5 « ^ the list of older sets, I have marked Dhaba and Sabya as doubtful-. The former is included in the list enclosed in Mr, Hope Cxill’ s despatch Ho. 70 of March 3 but not in the list published at the same time in the 'Umm-al- Cura”. The former list makes no mention of H a bya but it is included in the 'Umm-al-Oura' list, '* ^ke ’’Hmm-al-'ura” list shows Lith as having a station available both for telegrahpy and telephony. This is probably the one old Marconi set, as Lith is known to have been supplied from l^unfida, which was formerly credited with a set of this type. There is, however, some obscurity as to the re-arrangement since 1930 of the pre-existing stations, 7 ’ Mr * Philby tells me that the station at Jizan was putput out of action during the rebellion in ’Asir last winter, ^-e speeks of it as requiring a. new engine but rr^ own impression is that it must have been already repaired, as Jizan is a crucial point. the two portable sets (Marconi) which were presented to Ibn Sa’ud by Sir Francis Humphrys on behalf of his Majesty’s Government in April 1931. ^Department of Overseas Trade, to the Government of India, to his Majesty’s Ambassador at hagdad, to his Majesty’s High Commissioners for Egypt and Palestine, to the Governor-General of the Sudan, Miv to the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire and to His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden. 8 . i have no information as to the whereabouts of 9.

Colonel Fowle adds that His Majesty’s Government approve they will presumably ’’take up the matter with the Company in London and approach the Saudi Government through His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda.” 2.

On the whole the line of approach suggested by Ryan in paragraph 7 of his despatch, ho.214 of 7th July, seems the best, though Calvert might perhaps also, if that were thought desirable, be able to make some use of the fact that the Saudi oil concessionaires in Hasa have independently raised the matter with Cable and Wireless Limited. 3.

I find no further ccrres- pcndence on that particular subject in my files but, if I remember rightly i discussed the matter with the lias tern -department when in iingland. The Bight Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.O.S.I., K.G.V.O., etc., etc., etc.,o page.2 b! 3. ihe telegram referred to in the preceding paragraph was sent just after the resident had visited Ihn Sa*ud at Hufuf. My records of his discussions with the King and Sheykh Yusuf Yasin do not, however,contain ihey refer to the King’s desire to have telegraphic and postal communication between ^asa and the cuter world, in the event arrangements were made for postal communication oy arrangement with the Government of ^ndia out, sc far as -L knew, the question of telegraphic communication was not pursued. 4. x do not myself see any definite political cojecticn to the establishment of the service now suggested. On the other hand 1 am impressed oy Oclcnel Lech’s view^ that if established, it would be preferable that it should be in the hands of the Saudi Government and Imperial and International Communications Limited rather than that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company should be in a position to press any claim to establish a service of their own. 5. in this connection it is of interest to consider the present position of the oil companies in this matter. Article 19 of the puolished Hasa Concession authorises the concessionary to use * any bnec*** .. .. of communication*. This does not necessarily mean that tney are entitled to create their own means of communi cation^ and indeed the Diary of the Political Agent at 1933 mentions a report that the Standard Oil company s geologists had been refused permission by Ibn Sa’ud to erect their own wireless sets. On the other hand Article 5 of the draft Kuwait Concession, enclosed in your .printed despatch No.120 ( K 1739/160/91) of the 22nd March, contemplates that estaolishment of wireless and telegraph services by the Kuwait Oil Company Ltd and article 3 of the proposed concession for the any reference to telegraphic andxjiGcatalc communication. Bahrain for the period 16th October to the 30tn November Kuwaitpage. 5 , Kuwait neutral Zone contains a sirailar prevision ( see enclosure in your despatch 234 367 5/4/25) of the 13th June). As His Majesty's Government have given their blessing to the former draft and the oaudi Government seem inclined to accept the latter, it might be difficult for either to discountenance indefinitely in their respective spheres the establishment of a service by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, if that Company were insistant and could not oe told that the provision had oeen made for wireless communication between Hasa and the cuter world. 6, i fear that the preceding paragraphs cover ground most of all of which has probably been already examined in London but it is necessary to go over it to justify my support of the conclusions of the Political Officers in the Persian Gulf in favour of promoting the establishment of the communication oy arrangement between the Saudi Government and imperial and International Communications Limited. &lt;7 # regards the procedure, 1 am normally in xaveur of leaving commercial interests to approach tne Saudi Government direct. in the present instance, however, i consider that ion 3a*ud a reaction which may in any case •• be one of suspicion would on the whole be less suspicious? if he were approached by His Majesty's Government from the starting point that he had himself raised the question » with Colonel Biscce in 1932 and that the creation of a ' service at Bahrain by Imperial and international Communications Limited ( for the enlargement of their service, if they as well as imperial Airways formerly had installations) now enabled His Majesty's Government to pursue the matter. If he welcomed tne suggestion the details would doubtless have to be arranged with the Company '3 jpage.4 63 Company but, if tiie latter tnemselves took the first action, he might imagine that His Majesty's G-cvernment were using them to obtain some ulterior object of their own. He is well aware of the closeness of the connection between the Company and His Majesty's Government. 8. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political -^epa^tment, Simla/ and, to the Hen* ole the Political resident in the Persian Gulf, Hushire. 1 have the honour to he with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, Andrew Ryan.INDIA OFFICE WHITEHALL, 3»W. 1.

Dear Mr. Howitt, I write with reference to our discussion yesterday to enclose copy of a letter addressed on the 6th April 1934 hy the Officer-in-Charge, Imperial and International Communications Limited, Bahrein, to the political Agent, Bahrein, on the question of the establishment of a connection between the wireless station at Bahrein and wireless stations in Saudi nrabia. 2. As I explained to you yesterday, there is no objection on the part of His Majesty's Government to the establishment of such wireless communication by X.&amp; I.C.. We think, however, that it would be preferable that the Company should approach the Saudi Government direct on the subject, and I understand from our discussion that you see no difficulty about tnis. 3.

It appears that Cable and tireless limited have made arrange^ ments and that the Ba f udi Representatives have an operator with them who makes use (free of charge) of a circuit to communicate not only with Kofuf, but also with other Sa ! udi Stations in Hasa and w r ith Riyadh. 3.

It seems that the £&amp;*udi Bepresentatives are anxious to get the rate suggested for government messages reduced and that in return for this they would try to effect an arrangement for commercial traffic, 5. The da’udi Representatives apparently spoke of official messages to their t? agent” here, I informed the Officer-in charge verbally and confidentially that there was no S&amp;*udi agent in Bahrain as it would be against our Treaty rights, and said that if at any time a message should be tendered by anyone (this does not affect messages in connection with the present conversations) with a request that it should be sent at Sa’udi Government rates, he (the tenderer) should be Informed that government rates were not available for telegrams from private persons and that, if he then said that he was the agent of the Sa'udi Government, the Officer-in-charge should reply that he was not aware that there was a Se^udi agent here and that he would make enquiries from the Political Agent, 1*1 eut-Colonel, Political Agent, BahrainA INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

Standard Oil of California have got permission to use Wireless transmission Set either in Hasa or Bahrain for communication with Jedda. Could this be used for external Saudi communications on' Hasa side ? 2.

From the local point of view I think it undesirable that wireless communication from Cable and Wireless* Station in Bahrain with mainland should be carried on through American Oil Company*s Station there instead of Sa*udi Government Station. 3. I gather that Deputy Minister of Finance’s conversation with Officer-in-charge, Cable and Wireless, has been mostly concerned with rate to be charged for Sa*udi Government telegrams. 4* There can be no Sa*udi representative in Bahrain under Treaty of 1892. I do not therefore think that we should admit that anyone in Bahrain could be eligible to send telegrams at Sa*udi Government rates. 5.

After the lapse of this period the agreement will be considered as annulled. 20. Provisions of this agreement shall be put into force as fromNote on the -position in regard to the External Telegraphic Communications of Saudi Arabia* 1* The position as regards the Jedda Port Sudan cable is determined by two agreements concluded on December 18th 1926* One was an agreement between the Governments of the Sudan and the Hejaz* with His Majesty’s Government as a third and assenting party, vesting the ^jo)nership of the cable in the £rrg$ two first-named governments. The other an was/agreement between the joint owners and the Eastern Telegraph Company, by which the company undertook to work the cable* This v/orking agreement was made in principle for 25 years but was terminable at two years notice by either side. It was provided by an exchange of notes that, if either of the joint owners should wish to terminate the agreement the other must conform to the views of the Government expressing the wish. Under a clause in the Working Agreement, the Hejaz Government gave a monopoly of external telegraphic communication to the Company. 2. These agreements were concluded expressly in the name of the Hejaz Government, at a time when it was technically distinct from the Government of Ne,1d and its Dependencies. The Saudi Government take the view that the monopoly clause applied only to the Hejaz. The legal aspects of this question have never been fully explored on the British side. 3. The S a udi Government have long been anxious to secure a modification of the Working Agreement with the Eastern Telegraph Company. Thev consider the rates provided in it too onerous and of late they have been restive in regard to the monopoly clause, on the ground that modern developments make it undesirable that they should be so hampered. 4. When the late Sir H.Biscoe visited Ibn Baud at Hofuf in January 1932, one of the questions raised was that of the establishment of telegraphic and postal communications■between H a sa and the outer world. The question of tele graphic communications lapsed at that time hut was later revised. Following on correspondence of which the Govern ment of India and the Political Resident have full knowledge His Majesty’s Charge d•Affaires at Jedda addressed a note on the subject to the Saudi Government on Sent ember ISth. 1934. A copy of this note was enclosed in Mr.Calvert*s despatch No.278 of the same date to the Foreign Office and copies of that despatch and enclosure were sent to the Government of India and Bushire. 5. A few days after the despatch of Mr.Calvert f s note, but unite independently of what had passed in Jedda, Fuad Bay Hamza raised the question of the Jedda Port Sudan cable in the course of his informal conversations in London. This led to a suggestion that hP might have a non-committal exchange of views with Cable and Wireless Limited, who have replaced the Imperial and International Communications Company and who have a controlling interest in the Eastern Telegraph Company. From this exchange of views, which took place under Sir A.Ryan # s auspices on September 25th, there emerged a suggestion that Cable and Wireless Limited and the Saudi Government might engage in negotiations, perhaps in Jedda, with a view to agreeing on comprehensive arrangements in regard to the external telegraphic communications, by wireless and cable, of the whole of the Saudi Arabia. 6. The decision of Cable and Wireless Limited on the suggestion just mentioned was delayed somewhat by their perturbation at hearing that the Saudi Government had established some sort of wireless communication between Riyadh and Basra, without reference to what had passed in London. Eventually, however, the Company expressed a wish that Sir A.Ryan should propose to the Saudi Government that the latter should invite representatives of the Company to visit S a udi Arabia to negotiate disagreement. Sir A.Ryan was instructedto take action accordingly in Foreign Office telegram No.14 of January 25th. Steps were taken at the same! 3 ? $l) same time to infoim the Sudan Government of the position* ?• The object of this memorandum is to explain,without excessive detail* the connexion between three matters distinct in their origin, which have now come into conjuction viz.(a) the Question of the Jedda Port Sudan cable (b) the’ question of wireless communication between Hasa and Bahrain and (c) the more general question of the tose of wireless by the Saudi Government for external communication* The sequel to the correspondence etc. mentioned in the memorandum is shown by the recent tele grams .

Your telegram No.14. I made suitable oral communication to Fuad yesterday. When I mentioned exchange of messages between Bivadh and Basra he assured me that this was purely experimental. He said that similar experiments had been made with Radio Orient Beirut and referred to a project which had been suggested for wireless communication with Asmara. His general line was that Saudi G-overnment had a free hand except as regards Hejaz and I gather that Radio Orient had made definite proposals for a service between other parts of Saudi Arabia and abroad. Fuad expressed view however that it would be more satisfactory to have ajgeneral agreement with Gable and Wireless Ltd. He foreshadowed an early separate reply to the note enclosed in Mr.Calvert’s despatch No.278. Fuad reserved definite answer to my communication but asked how soon representatives could arrive here if invitation were given. I should like to be able to answer this Question without delay. If at all possible it would be desirable for representatives to be prepared to arrive here very early in March so that discussions could take place well before pilgrimage which will upset everything for some time after about March 9th. Delay may operate in favour of non-British interests and return of representatives after pilgrimage might be hampered by quarantine.Codv of telegram* From-Foreign Office* To - His Majesty's Minister,^ 9 dda* Beauatcheds 15.2.35 (12.45) Reed. 15.2.35 (16.30) Bated 15th February 1935.

Fuad said he could not commit his Government as they were expecting an Iraqi delegation which might be headed by Nuri Pasha and wireless could be discussed. I agreed to recommend acceptance of invitation for about March 25th subject to reservation that if status quo were disturbed meanwhile it might effect willingness of company to enter into negotiations object of which would no longer be that previously suggested viz. comprehensive agreement regarding all external communications.

JITB reference to my telegram No. 96 of the 17th ^pril, I have the honour to submit a summary report on the proceedings connected with the agn&amp;ment reached on that date between the joint owners of the Jedda-Bort Sudan cable and the two companies concerned, the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) and Cable and Wireless (limited). 2. Admiral H.W. Grant, C.B., and kr. H.B. otables, the joint representatives of the companies, arrived in Jedda on the 31st Larch in the cable ship Lady Denison lender, accompanied by Mrs. Grant and an interpreter. Just before they arrived the Saudi Government expressed a wish themselves to entertain the delegation, but they deferred to my suggestion that it would be more practical for Admiral and Mrs. Grant and kr. Staples to stay at the Legation during their visit. 3. On the 1st April I introduced the delegates to Laud -^ey Hamza, with whom were shaikh Abdullah Kazim, the Director- General of Hosts and Telegraphs, and two of his subordinates. The formal negotiations began that afternoon. It was decided at the outset not to attempt to amend or supplement the working agreement of 1926, but to work out an entirely new and comprehensive agreement. 4. The negotiations were conducted in the first stage by Baud Bey Hamza and the above-mentioned experts on the Saudi side and by the above-mentioned delegates of the companies. l ? uad Bey twice returned to Mecca, and was detained there the second time by indisposition. He was replaced by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin for a short time. The tv/o experts were finally agreed on the 16th April, and were duly signed at the Khuzam Talace early on tne next afternoon. As a result of correspondence with the oudan Government, I signed the agreement on their behalf, subject tothe terms of the declaration annexed to it, having secured your approval for this procedure in your telegram ho.67 of the 13th April. la) A letter addressee hy me to Fuad Bey on the 14th April, (hj The English version of the agreement; and (c) A despatch which 1 addressed to the Governor-General of the oudan after the signature. spirit or in a 'better atmosphere. The delegates of the two companies approached the matter v^rith great largeness of view and, though the Saudi Government wanted and got a good deal, Although 1 took no part in the formal negotiations, 1 was in constant touch with Admiral Grant and hr. staples, and had one or two private exchanges with Fuad Sey and Shaikh Tusuf las in. King, to whom I presented the companies* delegates on the 2nd April, did them the honour, not very usual in Jedda nowadays, of himself giving a dinner in their honour on the 3rd April. The Heir Apparent with a number of junior princes and other high personages visitea the Lady Denison Tender on the after-noon of that day. After the agreement was signed, Shaikh Abdullah Suleiman gave us an enormous luncheon at the palace, and in the evening my wife and 1 entertained him, Fuad Bey and the various delegates at dinner. 1 report these incidents because the cordiality shown reflects a desire on the part of Ibn Baud and his Government for good relations not only with the companies but with His majesty’s Government, who had done so much to promote the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement. reduction of rates will be a boon to the public and to some extent to His Kajesty’s Government, who are at present, unfortunately, the largest users of the cable. Article 9 effects a more equitable distribution of rates collected for wireless transmission when the cable is interrupted, and one to which the Sudan Government readily assented on my consult- 5.

Article 14 was the only clause which gave rise to material difficulty, as it qualifies the monopoly accorded hy article 11 to a greater extent than Cable and tireless (Limite were at first ready to accept. I was myself opposed to the possible creation of independent public services in Arabia, and I should have preferred to see the provision for indepen dent official communication with Ayria limited to trans frontier messages. The Caudi Government, were, however, adamant on both points. The arrangements regarding wireless communication between Hasa and Bahrain are, I think, satisfactory. 9.

The only other information on this point th&amp;t I have been able to obtain has been furnished by representative of the firm of Sharqieh Ltd., who state that Messrs. Marconi did not supply these new sets. They also gave a piece oi information which was new to the Legation,viz. that a German interested in wireless installation visited Jedda last spring and is believed to have disposed of at least one set here a set mainly designed for reception but able to transmit up to short distances useful for local purposes. 3 # Tjvom the 1933 despatch quoted above it will be seen that whereas Abha had only an old Telefunken set, there was at Riyadh a new Marconi station of six Kilowatts. 4.
