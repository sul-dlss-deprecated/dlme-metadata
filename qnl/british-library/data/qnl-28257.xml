(Received VSth January) (No. 4) Sir. Tehran, 4tth January, 1947 It has recently been announced officially that Maihdi Fatimi has been reappointed Governor-General of the Ears Province in the place of Javad Bushiri who has been recalled after holding office for only three months. 2. Fatimi was withdrawn last autumn at the time of the Fars tribal revolt which assumed the style of the “ Fars National Movement.” He is disliked by the Qashgai and his reappointment may indicate a decision by the Government to change for firmer treatment the markedly conciliating methods employed by both the former G.O.C. Zahidi and the late Governor- General Bushire. 3. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz reports that the course of events in Azer baijan has profoundly shaken the leaders of the “Fars National Movement” who are now seeking to obtain the Prime Minister’s permission to merge their “movement” with that of the Iran Democrat Party. This permission has apparently not yet been given and the Qashgai are showing some anxiety about the Prime Minister’s intentions concerning them. 4. As I informed you in my telegram No. 2053 of 27th December, the Prime Minister has ordered the suspension of election preliminaries in Fars until all the military equipment taken from the Govern ment’s forces during the recent tribal revolt is handed back. Some newspapers have reported that this order was followed by a general surrender of arms and ammu nition by several tribes, but this story has not been confirmed officially and the ban on the elections remains in force.

Each gendarme will receive 100 tomans monthly, uniform, and cartridges; but will provide his own rifle. This arrangement will be extended throughout Pars so that the whole provisional gendarmerie will be exclusively composed of local inhabitants. 5. The Prime Minister h^s agreed that payments for sugar taken from the Bushire customs should be made by the tribes at the Government's rates of 19 rials per leilo gramme. 4. The Ministry of Tar is insisting that rifles (about 3000) taken from the surrendered garrisons including 600 (not 200) handed over, according to the inhabitants of Kezrun, must be returned, but the tribes refuse to make even token return of 100 rifles. General Zahedi is to leave for Tehran November 20th to convince the Ministry of War of the impossibility of enforcing the return of the rifles now v/ithout undertaking military operations which would start the trouble all over again.OUTWARD SAVING TELEGRAM*- u# &gt; — ^ WP 260/6 / a no. 9 SAVim Persiac Mr. Bevin made following statement in Parliament^ 16th October, regarding recent events in Persia affecting relations between His Majesty's Government in United Kingdom and Persian Government. Begins. In connexion with the recent arrest by tha Persian authorities cf tribal leaders in South Persia and the disturbances which have occurred in that area, the Persian Government, in the light of certain information which they had obtained, came to the conclueion that His Majesty's Consul General at Ahwass, Mr. Trott, had been implicated in a plan for a tribal rising* His Majesty's Government, after a full investigation of the matter, have assured thd Persian Government that there is no justification whatever for the charges against Mr- Trott. The Persian Government' have accepted His Majesty's Government's assurances with good will, and the case may therefore be regarded as closed* In this connexion, and in answer to allegations which have been made in public statements and in certain organs of the Persian Press, His Majesty's Government wish to males it clear that British diplomatic and consular officers in Persia have categorical instr’actions not to interfere in the internal affairs of that country. His Majesty's Government have satisfied themselves that no British official in Persia has contravened or is contravening these instructions in any way, and that no British official has given subversive elements any reason to suppose that they could hope for British support. They have no hesitation in stating that all allegations and insinuations which have been made about the complicity of British officials in subversive activities against the Persian Government are entirely without foundation. His Majesty's Gcvernmont hope to see a steady and constant improvement in their relations with the Persian Government. They reiterate their desire to see Persia strong, prosperous and independent, and free from foreign interference in her internal affaire- His Majesty's Government have noted the way in which both the Soviet Press and Soviet broadcasts to Persia have given considerable prominence to the baseless allegations made against British officials in Persia* His Majesty’s Government are talcing steps to ensure that the true facts of the situation are brought to the knowledge of the Persian people.

The Persian Chargd d’Affaires, who told me that he had recently received the Soviet Agrdment to succeed the late Ambassador, called this afternoon and the following remarks which he made about the existing state of Soviet-Persian relations may be of interest,, 2. Sayyah told me that the recent departure of the Soviet emissary to Tehran had been arranged at short notice and that he had gathered from his recent Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacts that the Ambassador, Sadehikov, might not be returning to Tehran. Ministry of Foreign Affairs had shown some, impatience over the probable delay in the elections and irritation over tribal developments in the south. By his own account Sayyah had told the Russians that they only had themselves to blame. By insisting upon autonomy for Azerbaijan they had ensured that the other Persian provinces would also insist upon autonomy and the Persian Government would have to agree. In any case the position would be eased and it might even be possible to hold elections if the Russians would use their influence to persuade the Azerbaijan Delegation to accept Quwam 1 stsic] terms.

I took the opportunity to repeat our desire for a strong and independent Persia, reminded Sayyah what Persia owed to our action earlier in the year and gave him the true version of the Trott story.

I dined alone ^ith the Shah last night and remained vdth him for over four hours. 2, Before dinner and again later His Majesty spoke at length about the political situation and relations between our two countries. He began by saying that in spite of the Kashgai rising he felt much more confident than he did a few days ago. In particular he now could rely upon the army which he certainly could not have done a few months ago. He suggested that the Kashgai might be working in collusion vdth the Russians but went on to say that their support would be an essential factor in resisting Tudeh penetration and it was therefore undesirable that they should be disarmed (c.f. my telegram No. 1518 paragraph 3), I said that in the absence of definite evidence, which His Majesty admitted he had not received, I found it difficult to believe that the Kashgai were playing the Russian game. On the other hand, I told His Majesty that all the stories now current that they have been instigated or encouraged by us were entirely false and I added that I had just received personal assurances from all responsible British officials in Persia to that effect/....effect. Our policy was as it had always been to support the legally constituted authority against all subversive elements. 5, The ihah replied that this zealous policy of non-intervention was all very well but did not go t far enough and unless some evidence were soon given of our determination to assert ourselves as a Great Power we were unlikely to recover the ground which we had lost in recent months*. I said that our policy of non-intervention in no way implied that we were indifferent to the attitude of the Persian Government. On tbe contrary the more scrupulously we adhered to that policy the more important it became that the Government should be friendly in deed as well as in word. I then gave some account of my last conversation with the Prime Minister at which Prince Piruz had paid lip service to friendly relations while insisting on the right of the Persian Government to take unilateral action. He had sv/ept aside my criticisms of the evidence he produced and had made it clear that he expected me to acquiesce in the recall of an officer of whose innocence I personally am entirely convinced. Such an attitude was entirely incompatible with the maintenance of friendly relations which could only be repaired by an official repudiation of Firuz’s public insincerities against us and unconditional withdrawal of the Government's demand for Mr. Trott's recall. I told His Majesty that you had asked me for a full report which I had [grp. undec. ?furnished] and warned him that we were very far from having heard the last of this affair. The Shah took all this/.....this in good part* In fact he seemed relieved to hear it and assured me that during the past few days he had expressed his own view of [grp, undec.] with considerable vehemence. The rest of our conversation was of a general nature, 4, Just before I left for the palace I received no less than three messages which I believe emanated from the Prime Minister, One came through American Ambassador and the others from prominent Persians, It seems that the Prime Minister is perturbed at the absence of any [?grp. omit,] on my part to the suggestion made to you by Persian Ambassador that I should see him again. The message received by Mr, Allen was to the effect that if I would make a public statement denying all connexion with Kashgai rising and would inform Kashgai directly that they could expect no help from us, Persian Government would be able to come to terms with them without depriving them of their arms, I have given Mr, Allen and the others to understand that I am alv/ays ready to see the Prime Minister if he asks me to do so but that I shall not take initiative until I receive instructions [grp, undec.] proposing [grp. undec,] from you. The same applies to making of a public statement or communicating with the Kashgai. 5. Mr. Allen agrees with me that the time has now come for an uncompromising statement on the part of His Majesty's Government and it will naturally carry far more weight if made by you. - If Qavam were then to announce publicly that he agreed with your/,,..- 4 - your statement he would in effect be repudiating Firuz’s offensive insincerities. I have kept Mr. Allen fully informed. He has read Mr. Trott’s report and agrees with me that it is an entirely convincing statement.

The State Department would like to be informed of the gist of any further instructions you may send and this I propose to do on authority of your telegram under reference unless I hear to the contrary, 5, The United States Ambassador in Tehran is being instructed to use his influence in favour of negotiations v/ith the tribes for peaceful settlement and to urge some definite step in the north to show that the Persian Government intend to restore their influence there also. This last point probably arises from the Ambassador’s report that although Mr. Trott’s alleged complicity vdll be widely believed in Persia, some Persians are saying that parallel action might at least be taken against the Soviet Consul in Tabriz for his help to and open assistance to the Azerbaijani.4, Incidentally the State Department seem inclined to believe that replacements in Basra are not only better equipped than their predecessors, which is true, but are also more numerous. From paragraph 2 of your telegram 7635 I assume that this is not the case, but I should be grateful for confirmation.SECRET [This telegrau is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

Repeated, to Tehran New York (U.K.Delegation - Saving. IMMEDIATE . My telegram No o 5803. State Department have reverted to this question after receiving a report from their Ambassador in Tehran which suggests that you may contemplate the issue of a statement in Parliament denying British complicity in Tribal uprising in South Persia. 2. State Department consider that such a statement would have a very good effect. They hope that it may include an indication that His Majesty’s Government, in [grp.undec. ? direct] accordance with the principles underlying the United Nations Charter, desire maintenance of a strong and independent Persian Government, and an injunction to the tribes to bring to an end their fratricidal strife, talk over their differences with Persian colleagues and work for the common good. The State Department feel such a statement would do much to disabuse the tribes of the idea that Britain must really approve their action since the increasing influence of the Tudeh Party is displeasing to them both. It would also strengthen the Persian Prime Minister’s hand* At the same time the uprising will force him to take stock of the situation and consider well whether he has not /le ane d- 2 - leaned too far in [grp.undec. ? Soviet] direction. He may also come to realise that though the tribes have caused this disturbance, they can, if properly handled, provide useful aid if any threat from the North should materialise. If action in this sense were postponed, the State Department considers that their, and our position, would be much strengthened, 3. The Department believe that His Majesty's Ambassador is inclined to doubt the Persian Prime Minister's sincerity. They themselves think he does hope to maintain a balance between Britain and the Soviet Union, though he may sometimes yield to force majeure. However that may be, they suggest that any action we may take should be based on an-assumption that he will do the right thing, since there seems at present to be no practicable alternative to [grp.undec, ] balance which he may be able to maintain. 4. The Persian Ambassador came to see me last night and is again showing signs of excitement. He affects to believe in Trott’s guilt and to suspect British complicity. I told him [grp.undec. ? our] Consuls did not behave in that manner and that evidence so far provided was extremely unconvincing. We do not desire to see any troubles in the South. This appeared to have a calming effect. The State Department are seeing him this morning and should he show any signs of wanting to bring the matter before the United Nations they will firmly discourage him. They will point out that His Majesty’s Government can scarcely be behind this uprising alter their championship of Persia before the United Nations in a similar case so short a time ago./ Kis i’iia jesty*s Consul D. 2,50 p.m. 27th September 1946.

Major Loadbitter made no comment beyond saying that wo did not wish to support any of the /tribes- 2 - tribes and desired only to see a strong central government. Minister hov/ever insisted on his point and there seems little doubt that his purpose was to re-insure himself and two other Right-Wing ministers against the collapse of the present government. He said the Kashgai support would be essential if Tudeh were to be resisted, but he also hinted at the possibility of their playing in with the Russians and said that in any case the only hope of salvation for Persia lay with the British. Assistant Military Attachd was impressed by his evident sincerity. 4. I do not propose to respond to the Minister’s request for advice in the absence of specific in structions.

JJJ &amp; Jr\ flr IMMEDIATE SECRET Following from-Sir Orme Sargent. ; . ■ The Persian ambassador called on me this afternoon on • instructions from his Government to say that the latter had satisfied themselves that,Mr. Trott, His Majesty s Consul-General at Ahwaz, had been implicated m'the recent plot hatched by certain of the Southern tribes and they accordingly asked that he should be recalled. 2. I told His Excellency that His Majesty’s Government had been greatly offended at the accusations made against Mr. Tiott, first in a speech made by Prince Firus and subsequently by the Prime Minister in a conversation with His Majesty s Ambassador. I read to the Ambassador the relevant passages in Tehran telegrams Nos. 1488 and 1496 to show that the evidence against Mr. Trott proved nothing and that in any case it had evidently been trumped up for the occasion and that we were absolutely convinced that Mr. Trott had not been mixed up in any intrigue or plot. 5 . I could only suppose that this_ M frame^up” had been organised by persons who for ulterior motives were anxious to cause trouble between the Persian and British Governments, and I asked whether in these circumstances the Persian Government really wished to precipitate matters by asking His Majesty's Government to withdraw Mr. Trott in the face of our assurance that he had not been concerned in any plot. 4. The Ambassador said that his instructions v/ere definite but that he hoped that it might be possible to hush up the incident so that it should not do ham to iuiglo- Persian relations which were developing so satisfactorily under Mr. Le Rougetel s direction. I explained that the ' ' because of Prince could not allow a^ the stigma of having and we should te had been unjustly , had acted on inadequate or false evidence. • matter could not be kept secret iirsi:!; Firuz’s speech £nd secondly because we British official to leave Persia under plotted against the Persian Government therefore have to state publicly that Accused and that the Persian Govemmen 5. The Ambassador deplored the action of Firuz in making a public speech attacking British officials before the British Embassy haiL heeir informed that the Persian Government had any omplaint. Nor did he attempt/,..watrztmm attempt to maintain that the evidence against Mr. Trott was convincing, but he did. argue - that Mr, Trott had for a long time past provoked comment and gpssip by moving in all sorts of circles and frequenting m the process characters v/ho were not always politically desirable. 6 . I concluded the interview by saying that I would report the matter to the Secretary of State, who would. I felt sure, take a very grave view of this unfortunate development which might so easily have been avoided. 7.

He maintained that he had in his possession a mass of evidence including reports of the two Bakhtiari Governors and various independent agents which proved beyond a shadow of doubt that Mr, Trott was party to the conspiracy. The only two documents he was able to produce were however a letter of introduction from the prefect of the Burujird which it was claimed Trott had subsequently presented to Abul Qasim and a letter addressed to ^.bul Qasim by a provincial editor warning him to expect a visit from Mr. Trott, 3, I told Firuz that I could not regard these documents as in any way conclusive and expressed surprise that the Persian Government should be prepared to reach a decision in such a matter without previous reference to me. He contended that it was for the PersianPersian Governnent to decide such natters with the neans at their disposal# They could for exanple denand the recall of any agent of His Majesty ! s Govemnent vdthout giving a reason except that he was persona non grata# I said that this was obvious but that if the Persian Governnent insisted upon unilateral action of this kind the effect on relations between our two countries was bound to be unfortunate. I felt obliged to add that on ,, evidence H which he had produced so far the whole affair appeared to be a 'frane up' against Mr. Trott. 4. Firuz said that in any case the Persian Government were not relying solely on the documents he had shown me but on the great mass of evidence the bulk of which could not be produced before the trial now impending# He complained that my attitude suggested to him that no amount of evidence would convince me. He rebutted the idea of unilateral action and made a vague reference to an appeal to some international authority. I did not pursue this point but expressed the hope that when I next discussed the matter with the Prime Minister it would be possible to reach a satisfactory conclusion* 5. In the course of our discussion I made it perfectly clear that I could not agree to consider statements of provincial officials of doubtful reputation one of whom had turned King l s evidence as-3- in any way conclusive unless they were corroborated # I an asking Hr* Trott to cone to Tehran forthwith and neanwhile I do not propose to revert to the question of the issue of a statenent by the Persian Government.

Since the above was drafted we have seen a &lt; s S' , Tehran Reuter report dated 13th September to the effect that Firuz had told the press that the plot recently discovered at Isfahan had been organised with foreign S / ■s' ^ . help to provoke internal chaos as well as to bring about aoutward telegram 6347 a reactionary feudal 7. In view of the strong implication that His Majesty's Government were the foreign power concerned and the publicity which Reuter's report is likely to receive a sharp public reaction on our part seems called for. The best method would appear to be to give publicity to the interview with the Prime Minister which I hope that you will have and to our attitude to Firuz's statements. 8.

Cairo No &amp;&amp;$&amp;&amp;&amp; Following is a summary of recent tribal events in Isfahan and Fars. 2. Towards the end of August information reached His Majesty T s Consuls in Isfahan and bhiraz that the Bakhtiari and Qashqai tribes, alarmed at the development of the Tudeh Party's strength in the south, had entered into some sort of alliance, the ultimate aim of which was to seize Isfahan and Shiraz; destroy the Tudeh Party's organisation in these towns and dependent provinces; and to achieve local autonomy on the lines of that already claimed by Azerbaijan. Insurrection was to have taken place about September 20th. 5. On August 28th, the Persian Government declared martial law in Shiraz and Khusrau Khan, one of the Qash qai leaders, was summoned to Tehran. He responded to this summons, saw the Prime Minister and returned to his tribe on September 3rd. Meanwhile, His Majesty's Consul at S SAVING. . 110 .) IsfahanIsfahan was asked by an intermediary olaiming to act on their behalf, whether he could obtain arms and ammunition from His Majesty's Government for the two tribes. 4. About September 4th, Jahanshah and Abul Qasim, the joint governors of the Bakhtiari were ordered to go to Tehran. Jahanshah excused himself and remained behind to look after the tribe, but Abul Qasim obeyed and returned to Bakhtiari on the following day. 5. On September 6th, Muzaffar Firuz, Minister of Labour and Propaganda and the Prime Minister's right-hand man, flew suddenly to Isfahan and secured the arrest of Jahanshah, his brother Bahman and his father Murteza Quli and also Ahmad Quli Samsam, a former Deputy for Isfahan, all of whom were sent to Tehran under escort. Abul Qasim was appointed sole governor of the tribe. 6* Firuz also summoned Khusrau Qashqai to Isfahan, but alleging that Khusrau was ill, Muhammad Hussain, his brother, came instead and publicly declared the devotion of the Qashqai to Qavam us Saltaneh. He was then permitted to return to Shiraz. Thereafter, having caused martial law to be declared, dismissed the Governor of Isfahan and addressed the local branch of the Democrat Party of Persia, Firuz returned to Tehran on September 10th.^iJjENDED COPT^ND DISTRIBUTIO N [E1T CL,JR] C ABINET DISTRIBUTION FROII IIOSCOIT TO FOREIGN OFFICE Hr* Roberts No* 3003 D. 13th Septeabor 19L6.

Jahanshah had formed his plan for the rising when in Tehran recently in connexion with his appointment as joint Bakhtiari Governor and had simultaneously made contact with the British, 3. Morteza Quli Khan has also been arrested and sent with his sons to Tehran where other Bakhtiari Khans have also been arrested. 4.

Governor of Isfahan has been dismissed and it is not expected that Governor General ’will last long now. 8.

I Sfdd tnat I appreciated the attitude of the local authorities and in particular the identification and arrest of taaay &gt; persons responsible for recent disturbances. At the ?»«&gt; time, so far as I was aware, no one had yet been punished and acre arrests were not in any sense a final solution especially when accompanied by a venomous cam aign directed against the company by a large majority of the press in the capital and throughout the country (see uy despatch . o. 045). 2. fhe rime inister assured at that he was doing* and would continue to do, everything possible to provide lasting remedies. As regards the press, I t ould have noticed that action had recently been taken against severs /newspapersm I t+050. 2 . newspapers irrespective of their party affili itions, ami he intended to see things throa ~h in Khusistan.

He fully understood this vras merely a precmution&amp;ry uov^ but gave ;ae to understina that it was a source of ^r^ve embarrass lent to him. I said that troop move ments of this kind were obviously outside i^y province but that if I were asked for ray opinion I should not recommend any change in the present dispositions until (a) situation in Khnzist&amp;n was finally restored and (b) the general press situation in Persia was stabilised. '*;n the .rime Insiter’s ovuj shoving, first of these conditions had yet to be met and as regards the second I would welcome some expression of his views, for example, did he expect soon to reach n satisfactory settlement aoout Azerbaijan? * rime Minister ms at pains to reassure ue.

Che general political situation is at present so uncertain that we should, I consider, be prepared for all contingencies# If, as he may, the Prime tnister trere onw to yield to , oviet pressure he would becone the prisoner of a 'democratic front 7 ' formed by a fusion of udeh with /Azerb alienA*erbalj«B and terslan democrat parties* His politer in f huzistan would be reversed over night and ve should be obliged to taake such arrangements as we could for the p protection of our interests* In such circumstances a rising of the tribes in Pakhtiari Fan and Isfahan might not be unwelcome (see re contend at ion «o* 11 in :*y despatch o* 218). I therefore consider it most important that His ajesty’s Consul at Isfahan should keep discreetly but closely in touch with developments until the situation clarifies, leanwhile I should be grateful for specific instructions with regard to the line to be taken in our dealings with these tribes if the general situati i '.orates as I suggested that it may* For**i n Office please -ass to lev York* Government of India and ashing ton as my t leg wm os* 120 , 517 and 554 respectively* i Repeated to United Kingdom Delegation aen York and shington tele grass Nos* 1075 an 74 i*espectivel; .
