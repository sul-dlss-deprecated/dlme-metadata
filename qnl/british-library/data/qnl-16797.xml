However, it is inconsistent because the letters have been taken from separate volumes, then later combined in chronological order. The pagination therefore does not reflect the order of the present volume.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume consists of correspondence addressed to the Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1823. Initially, Captain John Macleod fills the role of Resident, but he is replaced following his death by Lieutenant-Colonel Ephraim Gerrish Stannus towards the end of the year. This file is made up of correspondence selected from four separate volumes and bound together in chronological order; it is far from a complete set.The content of the correspondence relates to British political relations in the Persian Gulf; more specifically, relations with Oman and Persia, along with matters related to the enforcement of the General Maritime Treaty 1820. It also concerns itself with the restoration of the Banī Bū ‘Alī tribe to their native territory, from which they were removed by a British Expedition against them in 1821.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prime Minister to the Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir 1st Baronet Harford Brydges Jones</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight John Malcolm</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Bū 'Alī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Alliances</topic></subject><subject><topic>General Maritime Treaty (1820)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
