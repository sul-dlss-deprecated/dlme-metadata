U l&gt; Department, E 9 JAN 1953 Dear Blaxter, Would you kindly refer to your d.o. letter of 29th October, No.98148/32, enclosing copy of a letter from Fowle to Parkinson on the subject of a possible extradition treaty between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. I now enclose copy of correspondence with the Government of India from which you will see that they agree with the Resident that the question should not be raised unless and until the Saudi Government revert to it. The Secretary of State shares their view. 2. I am sending copy of this letter to Warner. YOUFS siracereSy* J. G» LAITHWAITE. enclosure I* No 2 12 JAR 1933 FROM *■ 8 ECRE -1 Peri. ufNot.

Among the matters discussed hy Yusuf Yasin on hehalf of Bin Baud in the discussions which took place between the King and Sir Hugh Biscoe last January was tne possibility of an agreement for the surrender of criminals between Bahrein and Nejd. We have no information bearing on the nature of the discussions and no record of what took place beyond the reference to this point in Yusuf Yasin's letter to the Hesident of 29th January, on P.Z. 176^/32 2. The latest developments are shown in the correspondence with Colonal Powle now forwarded by the Colonial 01lice. On the whole there seems much to be said for adopting the Resident's view that this is not a matter to be hurried on and we have probably more to lose than to gain by involving ourselves in an extradition Treaty. Subject to the views of the Government of India and to any comments which the Foreign Office may make we might therefore indicate | that we agree with the Resident's vievs. A minor i point which would call for consideration in the event of H.M.G. deciding for any reason in favour of an Extradition Treaty would be the form of such a Treaty. The Sheikh is not allowed to enter into agreements with foreign powers except with our approval or to conduct diplomatic discussions with them save through us. The correct channels have been observed in this case, but the form of any agreement between Bahrein and Nejd would ca 14 — ,q inp-p^t.j , 3. The question is of interest from another standpoint as illustrating the desirability of concentrating under the Government of India and the Inaia/ r 1212 5 (,00 9.32India Office responsibility for Arab affairs in the Persian Gulf. It is very unusual for any question affecting Bin Saud to arise in connection with Bahrein hut when it does, under the existing orders it falls to he dealt with hy the Colonial Office, and not hy this Department, although we are, of course, closely interested in it. 4.

We should be glad to know whether you'agree with the views expressed by the Resident in this letter.' You will recall that the possibility of 1 concluding a 'simple extradition treaty' between the Sheikh of Bahrain and Ibn Saud was one of the questions raised by Yusuf Yasin during Sir Hugh Bis.coe’s visit to Ibn Baud last January. Sir Hugh Discoe ? s letter of the 27th of June to which Colonel Fowle refers in the first paragraph of his letter was merely an interim reply to an enquiry of ours as to how the matter stood. We are also asking Warmer for the views of the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, Uv ■gOPY SENT BY AIR MAIU| o. ifah\ 12 OOP X By Air Uail . Oonfidential . J» u. V'u6-d. The Residency, Bush ire. 251 h 3 ept anb e r, 1932 Dear ParRinson, Please refer to Sir Hugh Biscoe T s D.u. No.426-3 of 27th June on the subject of an extradition treaty between Bahrain and Nejd. 2. A reply was received from prior - Political Agent, Bahrain - enclosing a draft of a treaty on the lines of the Hejaz-Iraq Agreement. There ensued some correspondence between Sir Hugh and Prior on the point of the insertion, or omission, of a clause stating that escaped slaves should not be surrendered. Prior was for the insertion of such a clause, and 3ir Hugh for its omission. There would seem to be arguments for both points of view. 3. oh at I can make up my mind on is the undesirability of having such a treaty at all: on general principles the fewer agreements we have with the semi-civilised potentates and Shaikhs of Arabia the better. Alien a treaty is made Hie Hajesty f 9 Government abide by the letter and the spirit, or see to it that their protdgds - if it is the latter who have made the agreement - do so. The Arabian potentate generally abides by neither the spirit nor the letter. With regard to the proposed treaty in particular. Prior writes: M The moving factor behind the treaty is the ?1 Bf fendi A. 0. 0.

Actually Shaikh Hamad is very mildly interested in the Treaty and only embarked on it Decause we invited him to consider it and because he thinks, it will please din Saud.' 4. Generally speaking I agree with Prior. Instead of the treaty leading to more amicable relations between Bahrain and Hejd I am afraid that it will have the opoosite effect of raising unpleasant questions between the two parties, into which we shall of course be dragged. Nor does there seen to be anp crying need to alter the present position. dwen when no -extradition treaty exists a State, at its own discretion, can always surrender a fugitive from another country. In fact its powers are, m a sense, wider than under a treaty where the offences for which an offender can be extradited, and the procedure to be followed, are meticulously laid down. Thus in any particular case, Bahrain could always give up a man 'wanted’* by Hejd, and vice versa . 5. The suggestion for the treaty has come from Ibn Baud, or rather - as Prior suggests - from his 'Effendi' Syrian Adviser: Yusif Yasin. There is no reason at present why we should go out of our way to please Ibn Saud - rather the contrary. If Ibn Baud really wants the treaty he will doubtless put up the matter again through Sir Andre I^an* and if lie is luke-warm about it, he won* t.

Fowle's view is that it was undesirable to have any such treaty at all, until the Government of Saudi Arabia raised the issue, and this view is endorsed in subsequent correspondence and minutes from the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
