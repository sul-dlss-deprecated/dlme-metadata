Beil, K.C.V.O., Political Besident at Aden, to conclude a treaty for this purpose. The said Major-General Sir James A. Bell, K.C.V.O., and Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed, the Audali, aforesaid, have agreed upon and concluded the follow- ing articles:— I There shall be peace and friendship between the British Government and all the tribesmen, subjects and dependants of the Audali Sultan. The subjects of the British and the tribesmen of the Audali and its dependencies shall be free to enter the territories of the other ; they shall not be molested, but shall be treated with respect at all times and in all places. The said Sultan and other notable persons shall visit Aden when they please. They shall be treated with respect and be given passes to carry arms. II In compliance with the wish of the aforesaid Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed, the Audali, the British Government hereby undertakes to extend to the territory of the Audali and all its dependencies, being under the authority and jurisdiction of the said Sultan, the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King-Emperor. III The said Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed, the Audali, hereby agrees and pro mises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and the whole of the tribesmen, subjects and dependants, under his jurisdiction to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, treaty or dealings with any foreign person, nation or power, except with the knowledge and sanction of the British Government, and further promises to give immediate notice to the Besident at Aden or other British Officer of the attempt by any other power to interfere with the territory of the Audali or any of its dependencies. IV # The said Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed, the Audali, hereby binds himself, and his heirs and successors forever that they will not cede, sell, mortgage, lease, hire or give, or otherwise dispose of the territory of the Audali and its dependencies, or any part of the same, at any time to any power or to the subjects of any power other than the British Government. V The said Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed, the Audali, further promises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and all his tribesmen, subjects and dependants, that he will keep open the roads in the territory of the Audali\ 2 and its dependencies, and that he will protect all persons who may he going in the direction of Aden for the purposes of trade, or returning therefrom and that he will assist and protect any British party which may have occasion to visit his territory. VI In consideration of these undertakings and engagements, the British Government agree to pay to the said Sultan Kasim bin Ahmed, the Audali, and to his heirs and successors, a monthly sum of forty dollars, the half of which is twenty dollars. YII The above treaty shall have effect from this date.

The Beda Chief, in reply to my letter in which I inquired when he proposed to come to Aden and remarked that the negotiations should not be postponed indefinitely, states in a somewhat independent and importunate tone that he will not sign the treaty, unless I can promise to pay him stipend with retrospective effect commencing from his last visit to Aden and to give him 100 rifles with ammunition, 2 cannon and gunpowder. I have not replied to his letter which savours of tribal propulsion from behind and propose to remain silent until I can know more about his real intentions. I do | not believe that the Chief does not wish to conclude a treaty; he is holding out for better terms merely, and from our aspect there is no pressing necessity ! for it now in view of the recent Anglo-Turkish Convention in respect of the boundaries of the Protectorate.

To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, R.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 20th June 1912. My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to address Your Lordship on the subject of Protectorate Treaties with the Beda and Audali Sultans. 2. The question of a treaty with Beda was first raised in 1905, when it was anticipated that, in the absence of an agreement with the Sultan, the Turks might claim his territory and thereby indefinitely delay the Aden Boundary Commission, in a most barren and difficult country, from continuing the demarcation of the North-East Frontier of the Protectorate. We, therefore, sanctioned the conclusion of a treaty with the Sultan, but he was dilatory in the matter, and, eventually, in 1906, the Resident at Aden was instructed that, if negotiations with the Sultan were not successful, he was not to move further in the matter, hut was to leave the initiative to the Sultan. 3. Meanwhile, a despatch * was received from Your Lordship’s predeces sor enunciating the policy to he followed • No. 20 (Secret), dated the 4th May 1906. ^ ^ ^ Hinterland( under which the multiplication of treaties with the tribes was deprecated, and further attempts to conclude fresh treaties, without previous reference to His Majesty's Secretary of State, was prohibited. In a subsequent telegram, dated the 19th (f June 1906, Lord Morley specially referred to the proposed Beda treaty, and directed that the Resident should adopt an attitude towards all Sheikhs which would make it unnecessary to conclude a treaty unless the Sheikhs themselves insisted on it in fulfilment of pledges already given to them. 4. In 1909, the Sultan of Beda intimated his readiness to proceed to Aden for the purpose of concluding a treaty. In view, however, of Lord Morley’s instructions, the Resident was directed to abstain from entering into further negotiations, and to confine his intercourse with the Sultan to the / maintenance of as cordial relations as possible. In 1911, the Resident at Aden, lO^jj who has consistently advocated the conclusion of a treaty with Beda, again submitted proposals on the subject to the Government of Bombay, and pointed out that an agreement with the Audali Sultan was equally desirable. 5. The Bombay Government saw no particular objection to the Resident s proposal, and recognised that the proposed treaties might be advantageous. In view, however, of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, they decided not to support the proposal. They have now reconsidered their decision, and wehave the honour to forward for Your Lordship’s consideration a copy of the From the Government of Bombay, No. 3887, marginally-cited letter containing the dated the 8th May 1912 (with enclosures). drafts of which th ^ ^ to conclude with the Audali and Beda Sultans. P om ^ e ^ ou ^ ^7 Major-General Sir James Bell in his letter No. 104 C., dated the 16th March 1912, with the exception of the Dthambari (who are omitted from the present proposal for special reasons), the Beda and Audali are the only tribes in the vicinity of Aden who are not in treaty relations with us, while at the same time they are surrounded by other tribes who are. This anomaly is quite unintelligible to the tribesmen, and we consider that it is most desirable to remove it. The proposal involves no forward policy, but merely aims at the consolidation of a situation already in existence. We also, with due regard to the marauding tendencies of an only partially civilised community, concur in the Resident’s opinion that the treaties will prove beneficial to trade in the Protectorate, and, in view of the reported entente between the Imam and the Turks and the activity of the former in regard to our protected tribes, politically advantageous and desir able. In this connection we would call attention to the present intrigues of the Imam in Upper Yaffai reported in our telegram dated the 31st May 1912. In the circumstances, we have the honour to recommend the draft treaties and the proposed rate of stipend, viz., 100 dollars a month to Beda and 40 dollars a month to the Audali, for Your Lordship’s sanction. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marqtjis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, &amp; ^ (l l i/ (j rtt CQJt.. \No. 3887 (Confidentia 1 ), dated Bombay Castle, the 8tb May 1912. From—C. A.

In continuation of my letter No. 4057, dated tlie 16tli June 1911, I ana directed to forward herewith, for the consideration of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. C-104, dated the 16th March 1912, from the Political Resi dent, Aden, enclosing drafts of treaties which he proposes to conclude with th« Audali Sultan and the Am Rasa si Sultan of Banyardth (Beda). 2 . I am to observe that the terms of the draft treaties are based on the draft treaties forwarded to you with the Bombay Government^ letter No. 2433, dated the 28th March 1906, and I am to request that the Government of India may be moved to obtain the sanction of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India to their conclusion with the Chiefs in question. As regards the stipends to be paid to the Chiefs I am to state that the Governor in Council concurs with the Political Resi dent Aden, that the Sultan of Beda should be granted a stipend of 100 dollars- Rs. 200 per mensem and that the Audali Sultan should be paid 40 dollars-Rs. 80 per mensem. (T No. C.-104 (Secret), dated Aden Residency, the 16th March 1912. From— Major-General Sir James A. Bell, K.C.V.O., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Political Department. On receipt of Government letter No. 4056, dated the 16th June 1911,1 inform ed Sultan All bin Abdulla of Beda that Government did not propose to make a Treaty with him, but that they would always be ready to maintain the most coidial and &amp; friendly relations with him and his tribesmen. I have not heard from him since, but it takes a long time to hear from these people. 2. I understand, however, that the idea of the Treaty has not been abandoned; and that it will be favourably considered if the necessity therefor and the des a- bility thereof is made clear. 3 I would, thersfore, begin by saying that formal Treaties with the Beda and Audali tribes are as necessary and desirable as ever; even more so, indeed, a hope to shew. 4 The origin of this lengthy correspondence is to be found m the desire of t e Turks lo consolidate their power in South- West Arabia, and thence to advanee into t\e Wad^Xut This induced us to make Treaties, along the Turkish border, tribes which were by long usage and practice undoubtedly within our with many Turks never relinquished, however unreasonably, Brotec orate, ^« n 'uth we t“' of such tribes;’and with the former we then c ai • Treaty. But internal troubles and difficulties embarrass- policy of Government changing, the matter came to a standstill. m rr i- . ...ifi. Anrlali was merely a corollary of that with Beda, as the Audali 1 occupied a central and commanding position on the trade-routes leading into the rich Beda country. ^ ... r- i p n vprDment stopped negotiations, the Chiefs, having been gnen , 5 - totumllv pressed for thenfegitimfte conclusion.

I would submit, for serious consideration, two more factors of great im portance, in making these Treaties desiderata. First, the increasing and mischiev ous activity of Imam : who, having patched up a settlement with the Turks, is now consolidating his power on all sides, and (from reports received) is even making advances to the tribes in our Protectorate, and in Treaty with us. Diplomatic pressure cannot be brought to bear on the Imam to abstain from intrigue; conse quently it behoves us to strengthen our weak spots without delay. Second, with the exception of the Dthambari, the Beda and Audali are the only tribes in the vicinity of Aden not in treaty relations with us; while, at the same time, they are surrounded by other tribes who are. This differential policy cannot but be injuri ous to our best interests in this Prot^torate, while the inclusion of these tribes within the Treaty-ring so far from being prejudicial to, will be in harmony with, the prescribed policy of His Majesty’s Government. lam, therefore, still strongly of opinion that these Treaties are a consumma tion devoutly to be wished; and earnestly request that, subject to such modifi cations as Government may think necessary or desirable, sanction may be accord ed to them, and communicated to me, as soon as may be possible. 7. The attached drafts are almost entirely based on the drafts submitted with my letter^No. 1484, dated the 11th March 1906, and are similar to the Treaty made with the Amir of Dthala in 1904. The last clause of Article V (re protection of J 011 British parties) was added at the express N °- 8 desire of the Government of India,* who subsequently authorised its omission if its retention led to difficulty : but no such difficulty is now to be apprehended. But, should difficulty arise, this clause, also that regarding the authoritative version, will be omitted. 8 . As regards stipend, the Government of India (telegram referred to in previ ous paragraph) stated their willingness to sanction up to Rs.150 for Beda. But as there is now only one Chief where there were two in 1906 I think a stipend of $ 100 (one hundred dollars) per mensem should suffice. For Audali I recommend a stipend of $ 480 (four hundred and eighty dollars) per annum (=$ 40per men sem). Both stipends to be paid at the rate of Rs. 2 per dollar. _ l c PROTECTORATE TREATY WITH THE AUDALI SULTAN. The British Government and Sultan Kasim Bin Ahmed, the Audali, being desirous of entering into relations of peace and friendship, The British Government have named and appointed Political Resident at Aden, to conclude a treaty for this purpose. The said and Sultan Kasim Bin Ahmed, the Audali, aforesaid have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles ; I. There shall be peace and friendship between the British Government and all the tribesmen, subjects and dependents, of the Audali Sultan.

I am inclined to think that there is some misapprehension as to the obiect of concluding treaties with the Beda and Audali Chiefs. In the case of both these Vide correspondence ending with the tele- Chiefs this Residency gave expectations— gram from the Government of India, Foreign more especially to the Beda Chief—of the &amp;;iL No - 8U - KB ' d “ ted th0 20th desire of Government to form treaties j i ™ . Government for years were keen to brimr the same Chief into treaty relations with the Residency This indeed was at a time w ben the position of this Chief’s territory was a doubtful one. i.e., Government believed that, if we did not move in the matter, the Turks very probably would negotiate with him. J 3. I would now observe that:— (1) We have a treaty with Behan-al-Kasab and the Upper Aulaki, both of which are above Beda and Audali, while the Upper Yafai tract lies north-west of Beda and the Lower Yafai to south west of Beda and west of Audah on the east of which again lies the Lower Aulaki. With all of these, except Beda and Audali, we have treaties.2 (2) Perhaps our treaty with Behan-al-Kasab was an error, but to it the Turks have never demurred and so it is not understood how a treaty with Beda wou d wound their susceptibilities—Beda and Audali ly ing far south of Behan-al-Kasab and within our border. (3) It seems to be a matter for consideration whether we should defer to Turkish susceptibility in case of places well within our sphere, and the fact that we have all along done so has weakened our prestige notably along the Turkish-Subehi border. This has been lately Reported to Government. We see that the Turkish Arabs are emboldened to harass the tribes within our borders by cutting off “ kat ” ^supplies, simply because they note our indifference which is sometimes translated to mean our non-possumus.” The proces verbal shows that Beda and Audali are both within our bor der and so no question of Turkish objections can arise. By the Secretary of State’s Secret Despatch No. 20, dated the 4th May 1906, new treaties were disallowed because it was not considered advisable to incur fresh responsibilities with the tribes; but the two treaties now proposed with Beda and Audali will incur no fresh respon sibilities as regards any prospective intervention on our part in Arab tribal affairs. It would be as true to say that existing treaties spelt intervention, which is not the case. Inter-tribal affairs are left to the Chiefs concerned and only advice is tendered on all occasions, witness the Kaiti-Bir Ali-Balahaf engagements inter se. So that with tribes clearly within our border the despatch quoted above is not germane to the point at issue. (6) Beda and Audali are two important tribes within our border with whom no treaties exist, though they are hedged in on all sides by tribes with whom we have concluded treaties, as will be seen from the enclosed maj^in which the tribes with whom we have treaties are underlined in red ink. This isolation is displeasing to the two Sultans who cannot understand our preferential dealings to their exclusion. Hav ng given our word to both, it will be considered a breach of faith if we draw back ; and our action furthermore will most likely give rise to retalia tion on their part along their trade routes along which a considerable volume of trade passes nto Aden. It will be difficult under these cir cumstances to maintain such cordial relations with Beda, as wou d be effected by a treaty that would so gratify the Sultan and impose no further responsibilities on us than those connected with ^other Chief- ships. (7) Finally I would state that treaties with Beda and Audali are proposed not because the Turks may snap them up—this the prcces verbal of 1905 precludes—but because they have been promised to the Sultans who have been led to expect and desire them and because our circle of friendly relations is ncomplete by the exclusion of these two very important alliances. 4. In Conclusion I have only to add that the instructions issued by Govern ment will be strictly carried out and I have only made this representation so that the Government may be put in possession of facts that may not have been fully placed before them. P. D. letter No. 5939, dated the 15th September 1910. From—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C.-250, dated the 6th August 1910, recommending that protectorate treaties may be concluded with the Beda and Audali Sultans. 2. In reply I am to state that the Bombay Government see no particular objection to the conclusion of treaties with the Sultans of Beda and Audali and recognize that their conclusion might have advantages^; but in view of the policy3 h I ^i^’ 5 * * 8 S^oretety of State in his Despatch No. 20-Secret, dated the 4th May 1906, a copy of which was forwarded to yott with this Department endorsement No. 92-M., dated the 1st June 1906, the Governor in Council considers that sufficiently strong reasons have not been advanced for pressing the proposal on the Government of India. It is true that Government were at one time anidous to enter into agreements, but their advances in this direction hardly constitute a pledge, failure to redeem which can be characterized as a breach of faith. Turkish susceptibrities are not in question, and unless you can show clearly and con- yincmgly that the trade routes passing through Beda are in serious danger and that these routes are of real importance to Aden, it seems futile to discuss the matter further. 3. The map received with your letter under acknowledgment is herewith returned as requested. No. C.-182, dated Aden Residency, the 13th May 1911. From— Brigadier-General J. A. Bell, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the 'Government of Bombay, Political Department. \\ ith reference to correspondence ending with Government’s letter, Political Department, No. 5939, dated 15th September 1910, I have the honour once again to urge the advisability of reconsidering the conclusion of a treaty if not with the Audah at least with the Beda Sultan, who, since my return from Bombay has visited me m Aden to discuss this matter. The invitation was for several years consistently pressed on the former Sultan of Beda at the instance'of the Government of India. It was decided that the subject be dropped pending fur ther reference which should emanate from the Sultan. 2 In November 1909 the present Chief, Ali bin Abdallah, reopened the mat ter, vide this Residency letter No. A.-200 of 22nd January 1910. Hitherto the Sultan has been unable to come in: he never abandoned the idea of a treaty, but affairs at home precluded his personal attendance and we were averse to treat with a representative. 3.1 would here state as of prime importance that, to gauge a true estimate of what constitutes a breach of faith, we should judge not from our view-point, but from that of the Arabs, for it is this which will decide their future attitude towards this Residency. The Arab mind will fail to understand this volta-face. I cannot with certainty forecast the future, or indulge in any infallible prophecy as to probable danger on the trade route if now Beda is baulked of his expectations. I am, however, sure, after the recent interview here, when he urged his reason for the visit was to conclude the long-talked of treaty, that Sultan Ali bin Abdallah will return a disappointed man. This Am Rasasi Sultan, as he is styled, is a very influential Chief. Though well within our border he is free to correspond and intrigue with the Turks, who, if they defeat the Imam of Sana’a—and we must consider this possibility—may be emboldened further to consolidate their position south and to bring up matters of delimitation which up to now it was politic should remain dormant. It seems, then, unwise to foster discontent within our sphere of influence, where since the withdrawal from Dthala in 1907 our prestige has rapidly and very naturally declined and our fixed policy of standing aloof from Arab affairs and vainly endeavourirg to maintain cordial relations from a distance has been almost universally translated to mean indifference to Arab interests within our border. I 1 . Had these two Sultans never been approached by us originally, matters might have s umbered awhi e, and it is doubtless best to let the Arab initiate an entente ” and without prejudice reveal his true feelings towards us. Having, however, made the first move, we should carry it through if only to preserve our prestige and reputation for good faith, and also to close an avenue to Turkish intrigue and unrest already so patent on the Turco-Subehi border. 5. Turks in conversation have told Sir Ahmed Fadthl, the Abdali Sultan, | that the^ nine cantons are only nominally within the British sphere, and their attitude in Nawa and with the Bani Dthubiyani, in recent years corroborates this view. Beda is outside the category of the nine cantons.6 . The Audali-Beda quarrel of long standing have recently been patched up under the auspices of the Fadthli Sultan and we anticipate that the routes will now be secure and the volume of trade—already potentially great—increase. 7. We can, if Government so wish, tell Ali bin Abdallah, the Beda Sultan, that we are his friends and we hope to maintain cordial relations with him and his people, but I fear that this will be wholly unintelligible to him. The Arab believes only what he can see: he wants something more tangible than words. Again, although in theory we reserve our right of dealing with the Chief as the spokesman of his tribesmen, yet in practice this will not work in democratic Arabia, and in dis appointing a chief we embitter his tribesmen and so extend the area of discontent which spreads throughout the country. i 8.11 is, therefore, in my opinion imperative, looking to our isolation in’Aden, to cement our friendship within and to include the Chiefs periodically to come in to see the Resident. We can have no bold on a chief with whom we have no paper engagement, and we cannot afiord to give so important a chief as Beda the cold shoulder. 9. I trust that His Excellency the Governor in Council will review his decision and press Beda’s claims before the Government of India. The Audali’s claims are scarcely less important. He is still pressing for the treaty. No. 4056, dated Bombay Castle, the 16th June 1911. From—C. A.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram Ho. 2551-E.B., dated the 19th t “ June 1906, I an directed to forward herewith, for the information and orders of the Government of India, copies of a letter Ho. A-200, dated the 22nd January 1910, from the Political Resident, Aden, and of its enclosures, in which he reports that the present Sultan of Beda has written to him expressing his readiness to come down to Aden to conclude the Treaty referred to therein, and enquires, with reference to the instructions issued to him in 1906, whether he should proceed with the necessary negotiations in the matter. General DeBrath adds that the necessity for the Treaty is as great as it was in 1906. 2 . I am to state that the Governor in Council is unable to concur in the Political Resident’s view. Whatever may havehave been the need for a Treaty with Beda in connection with our proposed claiits along the Horth-Sast line when the work of the Boundary Commission was in progress, it appears to him that at the present time the position created by the proces verbal of 20th April 1905 renders the need for any such Treaty of less importance than before. His Excellency in Council is disposed to think that the terms of the proces verbal would estop the Turks from entering into relations with Beda, or objecting to our doing so, and that a Treaty with Beda would add very little strength to this position. 3. The Governor in Council, therefore, sees no good ground for recommending the conclusion of a treaty with the Sultan of Beda, and he propose^, w r ith the approval of the Government of India, to instruct the Political Resident to abstain from entering into any further negotiations with the Sultan on the subject and to confine his intercourse with the Sultan to the maintenance / of as cordial relations as possible.

DeBrath, C.3., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden; The Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bomhay. Sir, I have the honour to draw your attention to the corres pondence which ensued between the years 1901 and 1906 in regard to the necessity for a treaty with the Rasasi Sultan of 3eda. In the Chief Secretary to Government's letter Ho. 1428, dated 20th February 1906, sanction was accorded to a proposal that the then Resident and the Sultan should meet at Shugra and complete the treaty. It vras further directed that in the event of the Sultan not coming to Shugra or the negotiations failing, that all future initiative should be left to the Sultan. The Sultan did not come to Shugra and consequently negotiations ceased so far as this Residency was concerned. 2. In Uovember 1909 the present Sultan, Ali bin Abdulla An. Rasasi, wrote in intimating his readiness to come dow r n and conclude a treaty. He again confirmed this by his letter dated 31st December 1909. Copies of these letters are attached foryour infonration. 3.

The delay on the part of the Beda Suit,an in coming forward is due to the fact that he has only lately settled the affairs of his country and been in a position to move in the matter. As this delay has occurred I am addressing you in order that I may be assured that Government s|.ll hold the same views as those expressed in Chief Secretary's letter Bo. 1428, dated 20th February 1906. As far as the Residency is concerned no change has occurred and the necessity for the treaty is as great as it was in 1906. If Government still desire the treaty to be proceeded with I would askfor a reply by wire as small incidents are liable to cause a change in the attitude ol the Natives of the Hinterland.

A.C. ^ We send you this letter from the territory of Beda where y - 1 J o°od. fou are aware of the former trouble. We hope that you are conversant with the matter of the controversy Ex-Sultan x -md the innovations. When Ali bin Ahmed was reigning before, he had left the country uncared for. When we found that it was uncared for, we took charge of the Sultanate which was our hereditary right. We got the Sultanate through Sultans, tribesmen and Munsabs, all of whom made it a condition on us that we should remove the newly introduced practices and cause peace to prevail in the country and on the roads and we undertook to do so. We therefore asked the Abdali in the matter of the innovations and also asked him to send back our fugitive subjects who had bolted in the time of Ali bin Ahmed, but as he refused to do so, a fight ensued between him and ourselves and you have already come to know of the same. Eventually the son of Ahmed bin Husein, the Fadthli, came to us saying that he was deputed by you andHusein bin Ahmed. We welcoiLed^and said to him that we revere the Resident's letter out that we desire the Abdaii to be present. He replied that the Abdaii has agreed to do aw r ay with all innovations and that every thing should be the same as it was once before. Both of us then gave him a written guarantee and opened the road and tom-tomed that the country and the road w r ere in peace under the auspices of the Resident at Aden, the Fadth^li, the Rasasi, and the Abdaii and that whoever will act otherwise, the Resident of Aden will rise against him. We send you this for your information. We have previously asked you to send us a seal in our name. Te have done away with the seal of Ali bin Ahmed. If you wish to negotiate with us in the same way as you have done with Ali bin Ahmed in the matter of the Treaty you can write to your Government. We desire the sane conditions which are recorded with you and that you will give up Ali bin Ahmed. When you ask us w r e shall come down. We don't lie. As you already know we have incurred some expenses for Sultans, and tribesmen, and as the Id' is approaching and as we shall incur expenses for Sultans and tribesmen, we request Government to give us some presents which may be paid to our Agent Abdulla bin Qmer Al-Orajee.

There is thus every reason for avoiding any overt action in the Hinterland which may lead to enhancing the necessity for inter vention in the affairs of the tribes, and the conclusion was reached that the improvement of our relations with a knowledge of the tribes would be best served by the methods of work already laid down by this Government for Major Jacob and recently approved by Wn ( &lt;? 108 If s^rso&amp;T^, the Government of India a*l His Nos. 274 - 279 . ^ Majesty’s Secretary of State.

In transmitting these papers I am to state that Government approve of the suggestion contained in paragraph 5 of the Resident’s letter, and to observe that an ^express clause guaranteeing safety of British parties which may have occasion to visit Beda territory, does not find a place in the Dthala Ireaty.

I also forward copies of a letter received from the Fadthli Sultan and of a letter written to him by Sultan Ali bin Ahmed, the Rasasi.

From the above it appears that Sultan Ali bin Ahmed, the Rasasi, desires that negotiations should now be continued through Sheikh Ahmed Husen )m Ahmed Am Bubakr, the Azzani Sheikh, between whom and his former rival Sheikh Abdulrab bin Saleh Am Musa, the Hamakani, some misunderstanding would now appear to have been arrived at. 3. To these letters suitable replies will he sent and it may he hoped that the present negotiations may terminate in the conclusion of the treaty m a few months’ time. I am of opinion that for the present no further action nec o taken beyond continuing this correspondence in the hope that it may terminate in some more tangible result than has hitherto been achieved. 4.

B., dated the 20th February 1906. 5. In regard to this, I would suggest for the consideration of Government that the last 18 words of clause V may possibly lead to difficulty in negotiation, and might perhaps be omitted as unnecessary in view of the provisions already made in clause I of the treaty, for freedom of intercourse.

If you are desirous that treaty and friendship may be concluded between you and us, we are like the Chiefs who have entered into Treaties. We have many Sheikhs in the country, but Sheikh Ahmed Husen with whom you have bad some communication is predominant, and we are altogether under his control, so much so that we can never act contrary to his advice. Ahmed Husen is the man who arranges matters of settlement between us, our brothers and the Sheikhs of the country. You may now settle with this Sheikhas he and Abdurrab Saleh are in harmony, you and Ahmedi bin Husen may deliberate about matters effecting the stipend and such matters as may be good for us, our brothers and the Sheikhs of the country.

But there happened rain and flood in their country which had done damage. After they make things in proper order they are coming. We wanted to come in Ashoor, but Sultan Alawi bin Husen took away a mare from Am Rasasi, the brother of Ali bin Ahmed. This mare was an excellent one that it has no equal. He wanted to go with it either towards the lurks or Aden, we overtook him and recovered it from him. He has spoiled their arrangement. Had it not been for the mare of Am Rasas they would have come. They are still in confusion about this loot of the mare. We shall come down after they arrive here. Oh friend we want a Magazine rifle of six shots.

In accordance with the instructions contained in Government of India telegram No. 811-E.B., dated the 20th February 1906 , the Political Resident has included in the draft treaty framed by him, a provision un er ^ nc le Chiefs would he held responsible for the safety of British par ics w nc i mig i have occasion to visit their territories. The Resident has, owever, now sug gested that the provision in question should he omitted from le rea y, on _ ground that its retention might lead to difficulty in negotia ion, v 11 e e p visions already included in clause 1 of the draft treaty, ^ 11C piovi es freedom of intercourse, might he held to secure the desired o iject. The Bombay Government support this proposal and observe at the same time that an express clause guaranteeing the safety of Bn is par ies un er similar conditions, does not find a place in the Dthala treaty. 3.

I have, etc., (Sd.) J. J. Heaton. Acting Chief Secretary to Government4 ( Copy ) nnnfidential . From n Aden Besideney f 11th February 1906. I«Iajor-General H. H. liason. Political Resident, Aden; To The Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. Sir, With reference to your letter Bo. 874, dated the 31st ultimo, concerning Beda affairs, I have the honour to invite reference to Boundary Commissioner's letter Bo. 331, dated 1st October 1903, and to Mr. Fitz Maurice's letter, dated the 30th April 1905. 2. Mr. FitzMaurice's remark that Beda is the one serious gap in the Borth-East line constitutes the main argument in favour of the early conclusion of the Treaty. 3. A Political Mission with Beda as its objective was sug gested in this office letter Bo. 5193, dated the 27th August last in connection with the proposal to exact submission from the Dathina tribes and to generally acquire a more intimate acquaintance with the easterly portion of this Protectorate, and to establish closer relations with the more important Chiefs of that District. And it is not necessary to here repeat what was then urged in favour of that proposal.of acquiring some personal knowledge of the country and of individuals before treaties with then are concluded. There is good reason to believe that sone of the treaties entered into with the Upper Yaffai and with Behan-al-Kasab were not really concluded with the nost powerful and truly re presentative members of the communities concerned. 5. I am personally inclined to the opinion that a treaty the Rasasi Chief of Beda. This opinion is based upon in formation obtained from various sources including the Abdali Sultan and other persons of importance who have been in terviewed on the subject. But it would, I think, be desirabl that if possible a more direct personal knowledge should be acquired of the Districts before individuals are finally doubt that Sultan Ali bin Ahmed the Rasasi is really a man of influence, but one of the main causes of his not having at present visited Aden would at the same time appear to be connected w r ith the relations subsisting between him and the minor Chiefs of the sub-tribes of the Baniardth. 7. At the present moment the position may be said to be that there are too manv at work trying to bring in the Beda selected to represent the tribes concerned. 6. In regard to Beda itself, there is little room for SultanSultan m the hope of raining some reward. Each of these individuals is naturally anxious to secure the reward for himself and the result is doubtless that to some extent one is undoing the work of another. It may therefore he urged that rather than depend upon the efforts of ^ contending aspirants to the expected reward, it would be better that we should ourselves despatch a mission to the country. 8. It has now been decided to accept the apologies of the Hassani and Saeedee tribes, and a mission may be held to be no longer necessary to correct them. It may at the same time be held desirable that our acquaintance with them should now be improved. 9. Our relations with the Lower Yaffai Sultan have for some time past not been satisfactory and a Political Mission to the Horth-East might be expected to have a beneficial effect upon them. 10. Sir Hicholas O'Conor has recently urged that it is desirable to proceed with extreme caution North-East. And it is of course to be considered that the North-East line has not yet been delimited and that the Porte have expressed their willingness to at any time determine the frontier with us. 11. At the same time a magnetic North-East line has been decided upon and there is no room for doubt that both the DathinaDathina District and Beds lie to the South of that 12. Upon the whole X an of opinion that if the Rasasi / Sultan falls now to accept my recent invitation to meet him at the Head Quarters of another Chief, it is desirable that his country should be visited by a Political Mission, with a view to the conclusion of the desired treaty and to the additional support which will thereby be lent to our general claim that this territory lies on our side of the magnetic North-East boundary line agreed upon. 13. The Baniardth is reported to be the most fertile dis trict and the establishment of more intimate relations with the Hasasi Chiefs should tend to the benefit of the trade of the main settlement. Apart from the desideratum of effectual ly debarring the Turks from access to the Hadramaut I think it desirable that this treaty should no* be concluded with as little further delay as possible. 14. For the sake of jUbecx our general prestige alone it is to be desired that the object which we have for some years passed been known to desire, should now be achieved. I have, etc., (Sd.) H.M.

Heaton, Esquire, Acting Chief Secretary to Bovernment, Bombay • To The Political Resident, Aden. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Bo. 862, dated the 11th February 1906, formulating in res ponse to the call in my Bo. 874, dated the 31st January 1906, the case in favour of pushing forward am agreement with the Chief of Beda. 2. His Excellency^/as^ you are aware thought it desirable to invite you to come to Bombay to personally discuss this and other matters with himself. liajor Jacob, the Political Officer at dthala, and the Chief Secretary to Government (Sir Steyning Edgerley) were present at the discussion and I am to reply to your letter in the following sense. 3 # so far as it may be necessary to carry through to an end the arrangements already initiated to meet the Chief of Beda at Shugra and negotiate a treaty there with him you may -?vntinue on the lines on which you have so far moved and if QU itit is obtainable negotiate a treaty on the same lines and Wxth a promise of a subsidy up to the same maximum as that of Behan. Should the Chief not come into Shugra or should the negotiations not be successful no further move should be made and the initiative in the future be left to the Chief. I am to place on record the reasons which lead to this conclusion : 4. Practically the only argument in favour of the early conclusion of a treaty with Beda is that indicated in para graph 2 of your letter under reply. It appeared on discus sion that this argument has lost much of its force since the acceptance by the lurks of the principle of the con tinuance of the boundary line from Lakmat-as-Shub to the Desert on the true Borth-East line. It transpired that there is no certain knowledge, apart from the most recent maps, whether Beda li\es entirely on the British or Turkish side of the line. It is believed that it lies conside rably to the British side, so much so, that the British would be entitled to protest if the Purks interfered seriously in Beda affairs. If that he so there is little reason for the some what unusual anxiety for this treaty which the invitations to the Chief must have disclosed to the Hinterland tribes. |athina country for any political mission in the direction 5. There is also no further reason connected with the ofof the £Iorth-JSast• The submission of the Hassani and Saide^tribes for their conduct in the matter of Mr. Bury's party is being xm? accepted, and it became evident in dis cussion that anything in the shape of a Political Mission for the purpose of securing this treaty would have to be accompanied by a not inconsiderable force, and might lead to most undesirable difficulties. The case for any change from the traditional to a forward policy therefore seemed unconvincing. 6 .

In forwarding these papers, I am to explain that General Mason’s plans have been changed since he wrote his letter of the 3rd instant, and as ex plained in my telegram of the 6th idem he may visit Shugra on his return from Bombay. 3 The telegram which, under instructions from His Excellency the Governor in Council, I have despatched to you yesterday will have explained the position to the Government of India, and all that seems necessary to add now is that, unless they hear from the Government of India to the contrary, this Government will use their discretion in fixing the stipend to be given to the Chief of Beda under the proposed treaty and in determining the special favour ” which General Mason in his letter of the 30th January last to the Fadthli Sultan, shows he has promised to recommend. 1.

Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To —The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I bave the honour to report that the Shariff of Behan, Sharii Ahmed am Mohsin, who is now on a visit to Aden, has informed me that certain of the Turkish forces which are still operating auainst the rebel Imam of Yemen, are now in the vicinity of the marginally j°' b„. noted places and are within two or three ai Maiajim. days’ march of bin territories and those of Sultan Ali bin Ahmed the Rasosi (Beda). 2. The Shariff suggests that the proximity of these forces threatens to bave an undesirable effect upon Beda politics, and that it would be well if the conclusion of the proposed treaty with Sultan Ali bm Ahmed were no 4644 F. D. Cl2 longer delayed. I haye some reason to hope that Sultan Ali bin Ahmed may send a deputation to Aden shortly after the end of Unmazanto conclude the - treaty, but I would suggest for the consideration of Government that it these expectations are not fultilled and if the Beda Treaty is not concluded before the end of the calendar year, it would be advisable to despatch a Political Officer to the Baniardth with a view to as far as possible expediting the con clusion of the treaty and more fully ascertaining the true position of affairs in that vicinity. 3 I would propose that this officer should be accompanied by sufficiently strong escort to hold his own against any opposition which might be shown to him on the road, and that the party should either when returning from or proceeding to Beda traverse the Dathina district m which Mr. Bury s party met with opposition in 1904 and bring about the submission or the subjection of the Hasani and Saeedee tribes which then offended and are still punished by exclusion from Aden. 4 I would at the same time recommend for the consideration of Govern ment that the Political Officer deputed should be instructed to negotiate for a treaty with the Audali Sultan and to report upon the true status and condition of the Chiefs of the Basani and Saeedee which are the other important tribes of the Dathina district. Should time and opportunity allow of it the party might also visit the important town of Habban in the Wahidi country. 5. According to my information the Audali Sultan is a ruler of consider able importance and occupies a central and a commanding position on the trade routes passing through the Dathina country on which he levies transit dues Bie has a considerable following and, situated as he is between States such as Behan, Aulaki, and Padthli with which we already have treaty rela tions and to none of which he really owes dependence, 1 think it desirable that he as well as the Basasi Chief of the Baniardth should now he formally included within the number of our protected stipendiaries. 6. I have reason to believe that this Sultan would probably accept an invitation to Aden without his country being visited, hut I consider it prefer able that his territory should first be visited, and if Government are prepared to undergo the attendant expense I would recommend that the httie known districts under reference should now be formally visited by a properly equipped expedition. 7. Presuming that it is not immediately desired or desirable to demarcate the north-east boundary lines running from Lakmat Ash Shub to the desert, it would at least seem as well to be to some extent prepared for contingencies which the final Turkish reconquest of Yemen may be not unreasonably expected to possibly give rise to. 8. If Gov ernment propose that the expedition should he on a small scale and for the present to forego the opportunity of effecting the subjection of the Dathina tribes, then 1 consider that such an expedition is also feasible, though it doubtless would be accompanied with some risk to the officer deputed. 9. It is of course to be considered that a small expedition of this nature would* be less liable to arouse Turkish suspicions and possible protests from Constantinople, and according to my present information there is fair reason to hope that a small party would not meet with serious opposition. 10. I do not think that I should find any difficulty in finding an officer in Aden willing to proceed on that expedition, and to take the risk of pro ceeding with a comparatively small escort of the Aden troop, or of a ew specially enrolled Native followers.

From—The Resident, Aden, To—The Political Secretary, Bombay. P. With reference to your telegram of to-day, I will prepare the case as desired. I am meanwhile requesting the Chief of Beda to come and meet me at Slmgra on the 15th February next to sign the treaty, and I am promising the Fadthli Sultan that if this is arranged with his assistance, he will be eligible for a reward. If this treaty with the Beda Chief is satisfactorily arranged, I strongly recommend that I may be authorised to promise the Fadthli Sultan an increase of stipend from 180 dollars, the amount he at present receives, to 300 dollars per mensem. Even apart from the Beda question, I am of opinion that the Fadthli is entitled to some increase in his stipend. The Sultan has much influence north-east of Aden and a considerable volume of trade passes through his territory. No. 87-1, dated Bombay Castle, the 31st January 1906. From—J. J.

With reference to this Department Memorandum No. 730, dated 26th January 19G6, and in continuation of my telegram, dated the 30th idem, I am directed to state that in the opinion of Government the time has arrived for a review of the situation as regards Beda. It will be convenient if you will state, in view of the existing condition of things, the advantages to be expected from an agreement with Beda, the extent to which any obiections likely to be made by the Turkish authorities are invalid, and the particular reasons for preferring a political mission to Beda to awaiting overtures and a visit to Aden from that Chief if any such are likely to he made. Telegram, dated the 3rd February 1906. From—The Political Secretary, Bombay, To—The Resident, Aden. Your telegram dated 30th January. You cannot be authorized at present to increase Fadthh’s stipend; nor can Government address India on the subject pending receipt of full report asked for in my telegram of 30th January and letter dated 31st January. No. 724, dated Aden Residency, the 3rd February 1906 (Confidential). From— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to recent correspondence ending with your telegram of this date concerning the proposal that a meeting should now, if possible, be arranged with the Basasi Chiefs of Beda at Shugra with the assistance of the Fadthli Sultan, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of Government, copies of letters which I have despatched to the address of Sultan Ali bin Ahmed, the Basasi, and to Sultan Ahmed bin Husen, the Fadthli Sultan, and of a reply which I have this morning received from the latter. 2. I, at the same time, forward, for the information of Government, copy of a letter dated the 29th ultimo which I have received from the Abdali Sultan. 3. I am of opinion that it is possible that if the Fadthli Sultan really brings the full force of bis influence to bear upon the matter, the suggested meeting may actually take place at Shugra, and the desired treaty be at length concluded. 4. In anticipation of the possibility I hare the honour to request that some discretion may be allowed to me in regard to both the amount of theA*Ti 4 stipend wbich shall he allotted in the fifth clause of the usual Protectorate Treaty to the Beda Sultans and to the nature of the reward which shall be accorded to the Padthli Sultan in the event of his proving himself capable of rendering the desired assistance. 5. The stipend hitherto suggested for the Beda Sultans is 100 dollars per month which is the amount of that paid to the Aulaki Sultan under the t secret-, k, treaty * concluded with him in the year 1904, This with the dollar taken at the rate of Es. 2 per dollar would allow of a grant to each of the two Sultans Ali bin Ahmed and Alawi bin Husen of Bs. 100 per mensem. But as it is clear from past correspondence that one of the main causes of delay has been the desire of the subordinate Chiefs of Beda to share in the profit accruing from the treaty and to derive as much personal gain as possible from the transaction, it may prove desirable to grant the Sultans a somewhat larger stipend than that originally proposed. 6. It will not be possible for me to obtain instructions in the matter from Shugra, and with a view to the successful and rapid conclusion of the affair, I would request that sanction may be accorded to me to, if necessary, raise the proffered stipend to one of 150 or, if necessary, even 200 dollars per mensem. 7. The political advantages to be gained by the treaty may be held to be worth the extra expense which however will be of course, if possible, avoided. 8. As to the reward to be civen to the Padthli Sultan, I understand from vour telegram received to*dav that this cannot take the form of an enuanced stipend, or rather that sanction thereto cannot be solicited from the Govern- ment of India pending a full report on your letter, dated the 31st ultimo, which will not of course reach me till next mail. 9. I would at the same time venture to here represent that Sultan ABmed bin Husen, the Padthli, does not at present draw a stipend really proportionate to his importance in the affairs of this Protectorate. I would remind Govern ment that he is under treaty debarred from the collection of transit dues from which his more fortunate neighbour the Abdali Sultan derives such substantial profit, and I would recommend that if the Sultan now actually illustrates the extent of his influenne to the north-east of the Protectorate, his importance should be recognised by the grant of enhanced stipend which shall place him more on a level'with his old rival the Abdali, and will also have the effect of substituting a feeling of really loyal friendship for one of continued discontent. 10. I would therefore recommend that his stipend should be raised to one of three hundred dollars a month in the event of the proposed meeting taking place with the desired effect. 11. To these proposals I would solicit the favour of necessary instructions by telegram. If the treaty is concluded, as suggested at Shugra, all the trouble and expense of a political mission to Beda will be avoided. And in the event ot my present invitation to the Easasi Sultan not being accepted, it will then be possible to again consider the desirability of such a mission. 12. In the event of its proving desirable to slightly postpone the date o* the proposed meeting at Shugra, the necessary intimation will be conveyed by telegram.

You state that you will remain at Shugra for two days ; you are welcome for two days or more. As to Sultan Ali bin Ahmed we have written to him to come soon, and if he fails he may send his son with his seal as well as Sultan Alawi bin Husen and the leading men of the Hamakani and Azzani who may accompany him or his son.

After compliments. —W T e inform your honour that we have heard from a reliable source that letters have been received by Sultan Ali bin Ahmed, the Rasasi, and the Audali Sultan from the Turks asking them to go to Sanaa. We have despatched a trustworthy man to go, and if possible fetcii the letter from the Audali so that we may know its contents. Oh friend, we do not appreciate that these two tribes should go under the Turks, because the Audali is lying between the Fadthli and Aulaki and the Rasasi is in the neighbourhood of Yafa’. He possesses an extensive territory which would be large piece added to Yemen. If some arrangement could he made to stop the Turks from these places in a diplomatic manner, it will be touch better. There is no harm if these places will then be left aside by you for a long time, but our wish is that the Turks should be restrained from taking them. Your judgment is right. May you be preserved.

No. 120 in Secret e , June 1904 , Nob. 22 - 132 . treaty with Beda, which was last referred ' to in myV telegram,* dated 12th May 1904. J 2. In the telegram* of 12th May 1904, it was reported that the Chief’s cousin, who was the real administrator and the de facto Ruler of the State, was apparently under some hostile influence, and would not come forward to make the desired treaty, and up to the present there has been practically no further progress made towards overcoming that influence, or other motive, whatever it may be, which keeps this cousin of the Chief away from Aden. 3. From available information, it appears that the titular Sultan, Alawi- ^v. USei1 -’ ^ “ non compos mentis” and an actual nonentity in the State, and theie is little cause to doubt that any treaty concluded with him would be valueless and only lead to friction and disputes amongst the tribesmen of the State. 4. The Sheikhs and heads of the Beda tribal sections undoubtedly look to and support the titular Sultan’s cousin, Ali-bin-Ahmed-al-Rasasi, as the real de facto Chief of Beda, and it is his presence in Aden which is therefore required for the conclusion of any really satisfactory treaty with the State. 5. Hitherto he has rejected all overtures to enter Aden, and it is not possible to precisely state the cause. The negotiations of 1904 were mainly conducted through the medium of a certain well-to-do merchant named Hajee Abdulla Am Uraigee, who owns property in Beda and in Aden, and it would appear that it was mainly due to certain suspicions entertained by Mr. G. W. Bury of the bona Jldes of this merchant and his relations that those negotiations somewhat promptly terminated, and have up to quite recently never been effectively renewed. 6. As to the suspicions entertained there is practically nothing definite on the records of this office; but, from enquiries made, I conjecture that they were probably in some way connected witli the merchant’s endeavour to arrange some stipulation in favour of himself and certain other merchants concerned for a reduction of the taxes and dues levied upon their goods in the Beda State. 7. As to whether the interruption of negotiations was in any way con nected with the interests and general policy of the Abdali Sultan, it is difficult to make any more definite conjectures : although it may safely be assumed that the Abdali Sultan is averse to any measure which brings any other State into closer relations with the British Government, and renders his own less of a “focus” of Hinterland affairs and politics. 8. Apart, however, from this cause of interruption, I have reason to believe that another cause has militated against the conclusion of the desired treaty, which is in effect discussion amongst the Sheikhs and leaders of the tribal sections of the State itself as to the participation and distribution of the stipends and other monetary gains which are expected to eventuate from the treaty. 9. Beyond this, my information is to the effect that Ali-bin-Ahmed-al- Rasasi is a man of some age, and not of a nature disposed to accept more burden and responsibility, either now or in the future, that he can conveniently avoid. I am informed that, upon the death of the present titular Sultan,! it will probably be Ali-bin-Ahmed’s son, and not Ali-bin-Ahmed himself, who : will be elected to succeed to the Sultanship. I 10. It is quite possibly from a desire to avoid a source of friction with his tribesmen and a possibly considerable burden and responsibility that a man2 of this nature has hitherto preferred the comparative ease of his present position on the fertile plateau of Beda to risking travel and adventure in the direction of Aden, and a probable interruption to the harmony of his existence. 11. At the present moment I am engaged in a resumption of negotiations through the same medium which was previously, as aforesaid, for no parti cularly definite reason, interrupted, with a view to, if possible, overcoming Ali-bin-Ahmed’s reluctance to visit Aden, and otherwise, if possible, arranging for his son and some of the leading Sheikhs to come in his place armed with the Sultan’s seal and letters authorising them to sign a treaty on his * Enclosare 2 to Pro. No. 201 in Secret E., June behalf, On similar lines to those last 1904 , Nos. 201 . 206 . adopted in the case of the treaty* con cluded with the Upper Aulaki tribe. 12. I trust that these negotiations may in due course be attended with success, or at least serve as a useful guide towards the adoption of some alterna tive line of action. The present disturbed condition of affairs in Yemen may of course prove a source of obstruction or delay. But I hope that, in the course of the next few months, it may prove possible to conclude this treaty, and thus remove what Mr. Fitzmaurice refers to as the one serious gap in the north-east line.

His Majesty’s Government approve the views expressed in the Despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople of the 14th November 1905, as to the necessity of proceeding with caution in the north-eastern districts of the Aden Hinterland which have not yet been recognised by the Ottoman Government as being within the British sphere. 3. I observe that the Bombay Government have instructed the Resident that all direct pressure on the tribes in question is to be deferred until there is some necessity for sending a party up to Beda and the north-eastern districts. Should circumstances hereafter make it desirable, in Your Excellency’s opinion, to despatch any party, His Majesty’s Government would desire to be given an opportunity of considering the matter before any final decision is taken.

W. Bury’s survey party in January 1901. In paragraph 7 of his Confidential DespatctfNo. 5193 of 27th August last, addressed to the Secretary of the Political Department of ^the Government of Bombay, the Acting Political Resident at Aden remarks that there is now no actual demarcation to be effected in the North East. I would venture to observe, however, that this may lie so as far as the expedition now in contemplation is concerned, but that, inasmuch as the North-East boundary between the Nine Cantons and the Yemen has not yet been delimited, and the Porte have expressed their readiness at a due moment to demarcate this frontier jointly with us, care should be taken not unnecessarily to create the impression upon the Turks that we have taken the matter into our own hands and are practically delimiting the frontier ourselves. If such an idea should occur to them, I fear they would place as many difficulties as they could create in the way of our expedition. Bcda is indisputably on our side of the frontier from Lakmet-es- Shoub to the desert, but the Lurks consider it as one of their adminis trative districts, and are even inclined to regard the place as Ottoman territory. I have not offered these observations with any intention of inter fering with the proposed expedition, but merely foY the information of S. 32. A 2the Acting Political Resident at Aden in order that he may understand the position of affairs as it presents itself to us, and therefore realize the necessity of proceeding with due caution in those districts on the North- East where our claim to consider certain territories as within our sphere has not yet been recognised by the Ottoman Government.FOREIGN OFFICE.

It apj oars to His Lordship that the course suggested i in the Vice-roy's telegram of the 29th ultimo viz the con clusion of a provisional treaty with the Chief of Beda and and the despatch of an officer to investigate the facts as regards the boundary would be desirable, if it is found to bo practicable.

(Repeated to Bombay, Secretary of State for India, and Constantinople.) In continuation of my telegram of the 23rd April. North-Eastern delimitation. After my telegram of the 18th April had been despatched, I heard that Ali Mohsin Askar, son of Ali Askar, principal Sheikh of Mausatta Yaffai, and person through whom negotiations have been chiefly conducted, had arrived at Dthali with some other Sheikhs. He had nothing special to say, but Wahab thinks that attitude of Yaffai has improved since evacuation of Jalela, and that effect of incendiary letters will have disappeared by the time demarcation of the Amiri border has been completed. I am glad that situation has in fact somewhat improved, but it appears from conversation with Ali Mohsin Askar, reported by Denniston, Political Officer at Dthali, also from letters received by me and by Sultan of Lahej, that tribes are still very disunited, and that the principal idea of those inclined to us is to obtain as much money as possible. It will be understood that they are all very independent, and have little fear of the Turks. I hope policy of offering money to Yaffai for passage of British Commissioners through country will not be pursued, except perhaps as last resort. So far it appears to have increased dissensions among them, and effect of allowing one of the nine tribes to extort large sums from British Government for passage of the Commission through their country will be necessarily to lower our prestige, both with Turks and Arabs. In fact the precedent may well prove source of considerable embarrassment in future. If allowed free hand, and especially if treaties are entered into with Beda and Upper Aulaki, I have hopes of being able to effect agreement with Yaffai on fairly reasonable terms, and trust that permission of His Majesty’s Government will be accorded.FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS Secret Department.
