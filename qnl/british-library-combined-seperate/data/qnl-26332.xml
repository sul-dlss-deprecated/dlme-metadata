There is a postscript confirming receipt of the 'arzee' (petition) for Karim Khan's assistance from the commanders of the expedition against Kharg Island. The author informs that it cannot be delivered immediately due to it being Moharum [Mūḥarram], a sacred month in the Muslim calendar during the last days of which no business is carried out.*The date is not given, but it can be derived from its context that it was written between 25 and 31 May 1768. 28 May 1768 has been selected as the median.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x000011#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
