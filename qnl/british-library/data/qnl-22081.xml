I am proceeding from here to Singapore, Hongkong and Shanghai. I hope to he hack in Singapore before the end of April. When I start on ny I'eturn journey I will cable you telling you whether I shall he able to stop at Bahrain or not. I shall he very pleased indued to have the opportunity of helping to draft new codes of law for Bahrain. I had a great deal of experience of legislative drafting while serving in the Ministry of Interior and as a Jtydge in Iraq. At Basrah I have prepared an Arabis-TSnglish and Bngliah- Arabic dictionary of legal phrases complete with examples taken from the Egyptian and Iraq codes. This includes an almost complete set of Statutary Definitions. A« you probably know some 70 years ago the Turks produced a remarkable abridge ment of Mohamedan Law which is known as the 'Mejelle”. It does not deal with matters of personal status but very good abridgements of the Shara personal status rules exist in Egypt and the Sudan. Very good Arabic translations of the ’’Mejolle” are available because the technical terras of Turkish Law were entirely derived from Arabifc. Unfortunately no satisfactory English translation exists but I have copies of all that have been made. While many Iraqis who are anxious to Westernise everything want to scrap the '’irejelle' and adopt in their entirety French or Swiss Civil Codes my own opinidn i;3 that educated Mohamedans are acquainted with the principals of Mohamedan Law and it is better to take the ’'Mejelle 11 as a foundation for a Civil Code in a country such as Bahrain. The Ottomans adapted the French Commercial Code and Code of Civil Procedure. Experience in Iraq has shown that these require considerable amendments in order to meet the require ments of modern commercial practice. For example I expect you would prefer to have the English Law of cheques rather than the French Law. But French Civil procedure as adopted and amended by the Ottoman Turks provides a far more suitable system for securing rapid and cheap justice than does the cumbersome and over elaborate English Code.1 - 2 - © si. 44 ) Sir Edgar Bobham Garter who waa Judicial Advisor in Iraq aurmg The last War and after prepared a Ponai Code and Criminal procedure Code which are sjtill in use today. A new Penal Code has been drafted but it is based upon the existing law. The Penal Code wag baaed upon the old Ottoman Penal Code but woa considerably modified in the light of Sir Edgar f a experience in the Sudan. The Criminal Procedure Code wag baaed upon the Indian Code but was very much aimplified/ A1though experlence ha 3 shown that many amendment a are necessary ail Iraqi Magistrates and Judges are loud in their praise of it. I do not know whether you have a copy but I feel strongly that it should be carefully studied. In fact I think that criminal juatice would be more easily obtainable in England if this particular procedure code could replace the present jungle and chaos which masquerade* in England. I do not know whether His Highness the Shaikh and yourself will be in Bahrain in May or in India. If you are likely to be in India it might be possible for me to meet you there or my way back to Iraq. The best address that I can give is C/0 Mess- g. Thomas Cook &amp; Sons, Singapore. I do not expect that you would want me to visit Bahrain for a lengthy stay this Summer. If you wish me to proceed with drafting I can prepare draft laws this Summer at Bag rail and send them to you for consideration and criticism. Directly the Date season is over in Basrah that is to nay at the end of November I could come to Bahrain for a month to discuss the final draft. I would like opportunity of thanking you for giving me the chi to help in this work as it is a subject in which deeply interested and really my interest the matter of terms is a very secondary consideration. to take this the chance I am is such that Yours sincerely, 14.

No. C/3G 1-4/17 Dated the 25th April ia40 Thank you for sending me a copy of Judge Lloyd*s letter of the 25th March 1940. 2. I see from this that he is somewhat inclined to support the use of Ottoman models for codification of at least part of the law in Bahrain; and you will remember that I told you that the Political Resident is most insistent that Bahrain should use Indian (or Sudan) rather than Ottoman models. 3. In these circumstances it would seem unwise for Judge Lloyd to start working until he has visited Bahrain and had an opportunity to discuss the matter in some detail here. Judging from his letter you ought to hear fairly soon wnether but if not I suggest that he be esked to come here as soon as he can in the Autumn for a preliminary discussion. visit Bahrain on his way back to Iraq, Yours sincerely. C* Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq*, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain#Confidential D.O. No. C/636 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 19th JUne 1941. Will you please refer to correspondence ending with Weightman's demi-official letter No. C/346 dated the 23rd April 1940 regarding Judge Lloyd ? 2. I have been discussing the matter with Belgrave and I understand that Judge Lloyd is now serving with the Intelli gence Department in Iraq and will presumably not be available for Bahrain. It occurred to me that there is a remote possi bility of the Aden Government having someone either British, Indian or Arab with a good knowledge of law whom they could lend to us for the purpose of framing some simple codes of procedure for the guidance of the Bahrain Courts. Such a man would know Arabic and would also be familiar with the Indian Codes, which would be a great help as people who are accustomed to other systems have a tendency to try and introduce them. If this suggestion is not good, then there only remain Arab countries such as Palestine, Egypt and the Sudan and in these countries other systems of law prevail. 3. I am inclined to think that a really good Indian might perhaps be the best solution after all. Moat Indians have studied Arabic as a classical language in college and University and should not have such great difficulty in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of the language to carry on their work in Bahrain. 4. In addition to framing Civil codes of procedure, he would also be required to alter the Sudan Penal Code so as to make it suitable for Bahrain. I believe that the name Sudan /- The Hon*ble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C. I. S«, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Q ' I - 2 - Sudan Penal Code has caused the under current of objection to it since local inhabitants appear to have no objection to the Indian Penal Code and would indeed welcome it although they do not like the Sudan Code which is practically identical. I think the reason for this is that there are still a certain number of Sudanese descendants of slaves in the Island and that if the word Sudan is entirely dropped the objection would disappear. In addition to framing codes I think the Legal Expert should also conduct classes in order to show the magistrates how to deal with cases properly. He could also overhaul the machinery of the Courts and the office routine etc. 5 t I suggest that Belgrave might perhaps write to Ingrams whom he knows and ask him whether any one can be procured from Aden and if the reply were favourable the matter could be taken up by us with the Aden Authorities. If this fails we might proceed to try and get a suitable Legal Expert through the Government of India. Yours sincerely fs D.0.No. //r-3 - '{&gt; Balirain, June 29, 1941. Dear Alban, With reference to your D.O.No. G/67 r 6-4:/4: dated 28th June, 1941, enquiring about the Sudan Civil Code and Procedure. The only books of this type which we have are the Laws of the Sudan (1899 - 1926) and the Annual Supplements up to 1934. These do not include any form of procedure code and I have no spare copies of them. The books contain all the Ordinances issued during those years most of which are of only local interest. If you like I will send them to you, but they are not what you are enquiring about. I got them in the first place through the Sudan Agent in London, who I knew personally, but they are printed by McCorquodale and Company (Sudan) Limited, Khartoum. Yours sincerely, Major R.G.E.W.

B.O.lTo.C/237 Dated the 30th June, 194i Dear Alban, ' v Please refer to your demi-official letterUo.C/636, dated the 19th June i94l. I am afraid that Aden will not be able to helx&gt; you very much ae their own judicial system is in a somewhat chaotic condition. There is, however, no objection to Belgrave v/riting to Ingrains and seeing if there is any one there who could be considered for v/e need not take him unless he appears fully satisfactory, it occurs to me that Zanzibar might produce some one useful and if he wishes 1 could write to the Resident there. 2. We may as well give up the idea of finding an Indian who has sufficient knowledge of Arabic to do this work in Bahrain. 1 imported a Muslim tutor for the Shaikh's eons in 1929 under the impression that a knowledge of Arabic acquired in India v/ould be sufficient for Bahrain, but found that it took him nowhere, if v/e employ an Indian it v/ill be with the knowledge that his attainments in Arabic are of little value. 3. Palestine and Egypt will, 1 am afraid, be of no use to us ae their system of law is based on the Ottoman codes, which are quite different to the Indian system. it occurs to me, however, that v/e might secure an officer on deputation from the Sudan as their codes and conditions approximate to our requirements, and if desired 1 will approach them.

Zanzibar is such a small place that I am doubt ful whether they could spare a mar. to come here but I would be grateful if Colonel Prior would enquire from the Resident there. I think the Sudan is the most likely place in which a suitable man might be found and I suggest that enquiries might be made from the Sudan authorities. His Highness has already approved of the employ ment of a legal expert to prepare a code for the Bahrain Courts and I am sure he would approve of obtaining such a person from either Zanzibar or the Sudan.

During the course of a long conversation they complained that there v/as no codified lav; in Bahrain with the result that the decisions of the local judges, whose knowledge of 'k*A*f*&gt; affairs is at the best of times small, were quite unpredictable. They further stated that the Bahama community was not sufficiently well represented in Bahrain Government appointments. They maintained that whereas the Bahamas formed the largest community they held practically none of the minor Government appoint- -ments and as far as the Customs was concerned there was only one clerk from the community. Syed Said bin Syed Khalaf said that the present condition of the Bahama was infinitely better than it had been in the past and that for that they were very grateful to the Adviser and to the British representatives. He recalled the day when the A1 Khalifah divided the Bahama man, woman, child, property, and gardens entirely as they liked anong the members of the family and when the property of no Bahama was safe in the streets of Manama. With regard to the codified law I said that I wil-±- talk to the Adviser and pointed out that we are endeavour ing to have one of the junior members of the Al Khalifah family trained in legal affairs in Palestine. With regard to the small number of Bahama at presort holding Government appointments I said I thought that it was probably due to their not beeing sufficiently educated to make their employment profitable. At the present time we were all of us looking for clerks and I could not under -stand why anyone who could type could fail to get an appointment. It later transpired that Haji Mohsin bin Ahmed Al Tajir was looking for an appointment tax. in the Agency for his son Mohamed. 2-10-44</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000f5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/818</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000f5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/818</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 32/9 (4/17) Codification of Bahrain Laws'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-07-27T21:21:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (30 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the back cover with 30; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
