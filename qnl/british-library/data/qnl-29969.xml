No* 4 7 2.5vXnmi FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDIA OFFICEExt. 5516/41. War Staff You will remember the case of the German Railway Coaches ordered by the Persian Government which fell into our hands after the operations in Iraq. The main facts may be gathered from ;V[r.Peel’s letter to the F.O. of July 19th at Ext.4142/41, flagged. The subsequent history is that Sir K.Cornwallis was instructed not to let any of the 11 coaches go to Persia for the present; these instructions arrived too late to prevent the departure of 6 coaches, but he made representations to the Iraqi Government with the object of delaying the remaining 5. Bagdad telegram No.1025 below shows that these representations were successful; and that the G.O.C. in Iraq now wishes to obtain the immediate use of these 5 coaches for urgent military needs. In the altered frtkjlLtion vis a vis Persia, most of the previous argumentation on this case is out of date. There is unlikely to be any great difficulty in having the coaches diverted to British use. We have had telegram repeated to the Government of India and 1 do not think we need take any further action unless and until they show some more interest in the question.

There was some talk of our taking them over for military purposes/ but it was eventually decided by H.M. Ambassador, Baghdad, in consultation with the General Officer Commanding, Iraq, to release the coaches to Persia, in view of the political trouble which would be caused with the Persian Government if they were TOtained. Arrangements were accordingly made with the Persian Legation, Baghdad, to send 6 of the coaches to Basra en route for Persia. The remaining 5 are still at Baghdad. At this stage the Government of India sent their telegram of 9th July to us repeated to Baghdad. It has only just arrived. Th^rmaintain that notwithstanding the views of the General Officer Commanding, Iraq, the coaches will be required for our military purposes in Iraq. They also argue that on military grounds no additional rolling stock should be provided for Persia. This latter argument is, of course, in line with their proposal that no equipment of war-like value should be sent to Persia at present. It is, however, not consistent v/ith the provision of supplies to Russia, because even if v/e stop lorries going to Persia we must improve the facilities on the Trans-Persian railway by sending additional locomotives and rolling stock there - although the question of supplying Russia does not affect the disposal of these coaches, because they are obviously not intended for tne carriage of goods.O- 4, Vr. Monteath. '‘v. 'Rumbold. As the G.O.C. Iraq feels that he can get on without these coaches I should say that we need not be unduly worried over their loss so far as the inuLediate military situation in Iraq is concerned. 2 As to reason (2) of the Govt, of Indians telegram N0.1438/R of July 7th, I do not tnink tne military risk of handing them over to Iran is great. However, they are not on the same footing as the locomotives because these coaches are available now and the locomotives will not be ready for several months. 3 I suggest that our decision should rest on how Iran behaves now and in the immediate future, the Iranian Government is being naughty and we intend to apply pressure, every little will help and I would recommend adding retention of the coaches to the leverage we propose to use. ^ . I am marking this up connected with questions which at the Foreign Office today at to Mr. Monteath as it is were raised at a meeting which he was present.■7.3.122^/9^70 ♦ (rrv -hsh) i/ DEPARTMENTAI No, 2.

No doubt Turkish administration will realise that Iraqi administration cannot afford to see rolling stock on fheir section of the line fall below a certain level, owing to ^a) possible military requirements and (b) possible obstruction by French on Syrian section. It should not be difficult to come to some arrangement whereby essential requirements of both administrations are safeguarded. 3.

It will not, hov/ever, be easy to arrange the matter with the Iranian (Persian) authorities, and no doubt Sir R.Bullard is right in supposing that the Shah will be furious with the Iraqis and ourselves on account of our action.

I assume that there is no likelihood of Iranian (Persian) Government willingly agreeing to a friendly arrangement whereby coaches would be purchased or hired, either by Iraqi railways or by British authorities. .On the other hand, if coaches are requisitioned, there is a risk of violent reactions from Iranian authorities, including risk of reprisals against Iraqi or British interests, or both. Nevertheless, in view &lt;?f our military needs, I think we should consider in what way action might be taken so as to give least possible offence to Iran. Do you think it should be explained to the Iranians, either by ourselves or by the Iraqi authorities that war necessities .render it essential to retain these coaches for use on the Iraqi railways until the end of the hot weather, and that Iranians will receive of course, fair payment to be agreed with them either on the basis of purchase or hire? . 5.
