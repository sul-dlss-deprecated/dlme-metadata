Written diagonally alongside the colophon, in red ink, is a statement providing the information that it was made in the Gawhar Shad Madrasah, which was built in Herat in 1417-38 CE. Written diagonally on the right-hand side of the colophon, there is a statement that the volume was collated at the beginning of Jumādá II in 883 AH. Also on this folio there is a marginal note stating that on 12 Ramaḍān 988 AH (21 Oct. 1580 CE) there arrived an order from Constantinople to the effect that Jews and Christians were not to wear turbans but rather to wear high conical hats (taratir), red for Jews and black for Christians, and many turbans were removed throughout the Ottoman territories; however it resulted in many becoming ill because their heads were uncovered, since it was in the middle of the autumn.", "collection": "Arabic Manuscripts and Maps", "record_created": "2018-08-01T13:00:00Z", "holding_institution": "Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford"}
