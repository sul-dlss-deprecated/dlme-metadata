( After the usual compliments ) At 6-0 p-m- this evening the 3rd February , news has reached me from Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif to the effect that Shaikh Rashid (of Umm -el-Kaiwain ) having proceeded to Sa- -maiii for a friendly meeting with you 9 you have treacheroHs -ly taken him a prisoner and conveyed him to Abu Thabi .

Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph No. 352 of this Office Weekly Diary for 1907; as I was accompanied on my visit to the Trucial Coast by H. M.S. Proserpine with the Senior Naval Officer, who will be reporting to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, I have the honour to submit details of what passed for the parallel information of the Government of India. 2. Commander H. W. James of that vessel who had only arrived in these waters a few days before for the first time requested me to supply him with a memorandum explaining the position of affairs, and though what I recorded was somewhat hurriedly written for his own enlightenment, it gives a con nected account of our proceedings and I will therefore ask the Government of India to accept it with a few additional observations, as my report to them. The details for the 25th instant were added after the Froserpine left, in order to complete the narrative. 3. I should premise that I had asked the Senior Naval Officer some weeks before to spare the services of one of the subsidised ships as soon as a conve nient opportunity offered, to accompany me to Shargah. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid, Chief of that principality, is a friendly and hospitable personage, and not inclined to be contumacious, but the same incor rigible apathy which has alienated from him the Chiefs of Pujeirah, and Hamriyeh and most of his former Bedouin adherents, when applied to the ordinary claims of British subjects and inter-trucial pearl-diving disputes, makes this Sheikh very difficult to deal with, and experience shows that the Eesidency Agent, on the spot, has little influence with him. In the present case, I or the Agent had for the last six months been continually pressing him to settle several proved claims due to Umm-el-Kowein on account of runaway pearl divers whom he had harboured or allowed to be employed in contravention of the Engagement of 24th June 1879 ; but in spite of repeated promises and a written undertaking to the Eesidency Agent he persistently failed to fulfil his obligations. Had the claims been allowed to run on unsettled to the beginning of another pearling season, much trouble would have resulted, and I was therefore constrained to ask for the presence of one of His Majesty's ships at my next visit as being the best means of bringing the Sheikh to the scratch. As will be seen this course had the desired result. Sheikh Sagar deposited with me the amount of the proved Umm-el-Xowein claims, and the cross-claims which he professes to have against Umm-el-Kowein will now be gone into by the usual Majlis ' before the money is paid over. 4. Just as I was about to leave for Mohammerah and thence for Shargah on the above business, I received the Residency Agent's report of the treacher ous capture of the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein by the Sheikh of Abu Thabi. The position of affairs between these Chiefs in October last was reported in paragraph 1346 of the Eesidency Diary for 1906 and the accompanying memorandum carries on the narrative. I attach a translation of the friendly letter (of which I have the original) from Sheikh Zaeed to the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein, on the strength of which the latter, who was then on a hunting expedition, rode on with his few followers to pay a visit of reconciliation to the doyen of the Trucial Chiefs. This letter was simply penned with the intention of entrapping the addressee ; the Sheikhs of Shargah and Debai, who spoke on Abu Tbabi's behalf, did not attempt to repudiate it but simply defended it as a piece of Arab stratagem and diplomacy. When I wrote to Sheikh Zaeed immediately on receiving the news, before leaving for Mohammerah, upbraiding him for his action and calling for the immediate release of Sheikh Eashid, I did so simply in view of a flagrant act of treachery, as such, perpetrated by one Chief on another, which sm F. D. ! j.it sP6iTifd impossible to ignore as a matter of internal politics ; but as I found thnt the act was followed by the despatch of Umm-el-Kowein's retinue as prisoners to Abu Tbabi ly* sea, a proceeding which constitutes a technical breach of the Maritime Truce, aud as the result of the action taken has been satisfactory, I hope the Government of India will in any case endorse it \dth their approval. 5. Should it even appear to Government that Sheikh Zaeed's treacherous conduct has not been adequately visited upon him by the enforced release of bis prisoners, I venture nevertheless to urge that the solution which has been ultimately arrived at is perhaps the best in the general interests of the Trucial Chiefs collectively, and I think it would probably weaken my position with them if the Government of India were to go behind it, by imposing a fine or other further penalty upon the chief offender. It would, on the other hand, have an effect both beneficial to the Chiefs and helpful to me if the Government of India were pleased to instruct me to issue a circular homily to all of the Trucial Chiefs, on their behalf, in comment of the recent incident somewhat on the following lines, or otherwise as they deem fit. That they have before them the Eesident's report on the recent combined action of four of the Trucial Sheikhs against the ?heikh of Umm-el-Kowein ; that they are not concerned to discuss the details of the intertribal dissensions which gave rise to that action, though they are at the same time glad to note that an amicable settlement of differences has in the result been nesociated ; but that the act of treachery perpetrated by one of their number against the other has been most abhorrent and surprising to them and that such conduct can in no case be tolerated; that under ordinary circumstances they would not feel disposed to let the matter rest where it is, but that on this occasion, at Major Cox's instance, and in view of the peace which has been effected with his friendly co-operation, they refrain from inflicting any specific punishment, but warn the Chiefs that any similar act on the part of one Trucial Sheikh against another in the future will be made a severe example of. 6. I was no doubt greatly indebted to the helpful presence of H.M.S. Froserjpine for the comparatively speedy release of the Sheikh of Umm-el- Kowein, and I attach a copy of the official acknowledgment which I addressed to her Commander before we separated. Memorandum explaining circumstances which led up to the treacherous seizure aud imprison ment of t he Sheikh of L T mm-el-Kowein by the Sheikh of Abu Thabi, January and February lfe07. There are six Sheikhs on the North Coast of Oman under British protec tion, and in treaty relations with us in connection with the suppression of piracy and the slave traffic and the preservation of peace on the pearl banks. These six Sheikhs are generally sparring among themselves, making treaties of friendship to-day and breaking them to-morrow. Ordinarily and tribally they assort themselves as follows:— (1) Abu Thabi and Debai, being of the same tribe, hunt in couples. (2) Shargah, Ajman, Umm-el-Kowein and Kas-el-Kheima form the other part, which on large questions are generally opposed, on principle, to the other two. As a rule, however, among themselves they are never all in accord. For many years past the Sheikh of Abu Tliabi, being an old patriarch of nearly 90, and having ruled for CO years or more has been the strongest and most influential man on the Coast, that is to say, the majority of the .Bedouins occupying the hinterland are' allied with him and respond to his call when he wants them, in return for periodical liberal presents in money and provisions. The Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein only succeeded his father about two years ago. lie is young and somewhat blatant, at the same time has plenty of money, is a good man of business and staunch to his adherents when in difficulties.V fA r ►- x- The result is that numbers of tlie Bedcuins, who formerly adliered to Shar^ab and Abu Ihabi, have deserted the former on account of his weakness and the latter on account of his distance, and have transferred their favours to Umm-el-Kowein, who perhaps suffers somewhat from swelled head in conse quence and is disinclined to listen to the Sheikh of Abu Thabi and inclined to take advantage of Shargah's weak character and annoy him through his wavering Bedouin adherents. For a long time past the Sheikh of Abu Thabi has been vowing to wheel 'Umm-el-Kowein into line, and although the British authoiities do not actively interfere in internal politics of the hinterland, the Resident is expected to use his influence on such occasions with the Chiefs personally to keep the peace and smooth over differences between them. This he has endeavoured to do repeatedly during the la&amp;t two years in the present case and until recently with success. In November, however, a report reached the Besident to the effect that the Sheikh of Abu Thabi meditated raising a force to attack Umm-el-Kowein or bis Bedouin adherents as soon as the fasting month of Ramzan was over. On hearing this the Resident addressed both the Chiefs, remonstrating with them on the folly of fighting and pressing them to submit to arbitration. They both replied in conciliatory terms, and on 31st December the Residency Aovnt reported that peace had been made both between Umm-el-Kowein and Abu Thabi and between Abu Thabi and the Bedouin tribe of Bern Katab whose changeable attitude towards the two Sheikhs individually had been the chief apple of discord between the latter. Later on, however, on 25th January the Residency Agent at Shargah renorted that in pursuance of the apparent peace and on the strength of a friendly letter from the Sheikh of Abu Tbabi, the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowem had proceeded to pay a personal visit of reconciliation to the Sheikh of Abu Thabi and that after being received with apparent hospitality, had suddenly been seized and put in chains together with his lew companions, or servants, numbering 19 in all. This took place at Semaih in the hinterland near Abu Thabi. The retainers were sent back in custody to Abu Thabi, while the Sheikh of Abu Thabi, taking his imprisoned guest w T ith him, advanced northwards intending to attack Umm-el-Kowein, and to raze to the ground the port of Falai about 30 miles inland from Umm -el-Kowein, an oasis belonging to the latter which was used as a rendezvous for collecting his adherents by the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein. When this news was received Major Cox was already about to proceed to the Trucial Coast, with the moral support of H.M.S. Proserpine, to induce the Sheikh of Shargah to settle some claims under the Agreement between the Trucial Sheikhs regarding absconding pearl divers, which he had obstinately or apathetically neglected to settle in spite of repeated pressure Irom and promises to the Resident. The arrival of the Froserpine on 17th February and of Major Cox in the R I M.S. Lawrence the following day found the Sheikh of Shargah absent ten miles inland, encamped with the Sheikhs of Abu Thabi, Debar and A]man, with it is alleged, 3 or 4,000 adherents, and meditating an attack on r alai. The Sheikh of Umm -el-Kowein was still a prisoner in irons in their camp and havine thus got him in their power the other Sheikhs in combination were trvin^ to induce him to agree to the demolition of his fort, guarding the plan tations at Falai, and to other terms, as the price of his release. The Resident had already written by the preceding mail from Bushire to the Sheikh of Abu Thabi calling on him at once to release^ the bheikh ot ITmm -el-Kowein, but the letter had not yet reached its destination. Imme diately on arrival therefore he sent letters to the Sheikhs of Shargah and Abu Thabi callin 0 ' on the former to return to Shargah to interview him and to settle the outstanding claims; and calling on the latter to release his prisoner immediately or send him in to the Resident, who undertook, on his release, to endeavour to make a satisfactory settlement between them.The Sheikh of Sbargah after a little hesitation and on receipt of a second letter came in and proceeded on board the Froserpine, bringing with him the amount of the pearling claims as a deposit. The Sheikh of Abu Thabi wrote at the same time in respectful terms, but demurred to releasing his prisoner except on certain conditions being guaranteed first. The particular conditions desired were not mentioned by the Sheikh of Abu Thabi in his letter, but he wrote that the Sheikh of Shargab, who brought the communication, would explain them. The terms mentioned were incidentally touched upon in conversation with the Sheikh of Shargah during his visit on board H.M.S. Proserpine, but it is not necessary to enter into them here as the Resident maintained that he was not prepared to make any stipulations regarding the prisoner's release, but demanded it at once, unconditionally. He regarded the imprisonment of the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein as a piece of unwarrantable treachery ( which the perpetrators were pleased to term ' strategy 'and the despatch of his score of followers to Abu Thabi by sea as prisoners, as a violation of the spirit of the Maritime Truce, both of tvhich acts put Abu Thabi entirely in the wrong. He added, however, that as soon as the prisoner was delivered to him he was prepared to co-operate in helping the Sheikhs to arrive at a settlement of their differences. A letter in the above terms was given to the Sheikh of Shargah for conveyance or despatch to the Sheikh of Abu Thabi that night. It concluded with a final warning to the latter to accept the Resident's decision and informed him that if the prisoner was not released by noon the next day (February 21st) he. Major Cox, would not discuss the matter further but would proceed forthwith to Henjam and communicate with the Government of India. Some hours extra law had to be accorded owing to the failure of the Sheikh of Shargah to leave that ni^ht as he had promised, but the following evening a letter arrived from him'in which he explained that he had been delayed in reaching the camp; that it was too late to settle matters that night and that he begged that the time might be extended until the morrow (February 22nd). In due course the following afternoon, the released Sheikh arrived under a guard of 20 Manaseer Bedouins and was followed by the Sheikhs of Debai and Shargah. They all proceeded on board the RJ.M.S. Lawrence, the Sheikh of Umm -el-Kowein oommg off in charge of the Residency Agent. It was too late to discuss their differences that night, but the following morning the Resident went on shore and spent the day endeavouring to get the three Sheikhs to come to a modus mtendi, for proposal by them to the Sheikh of Abu Thabi. Meanwhile a further letter was despatched to the latter in which Maior Cox expressed his satisfaction that the Sheikh had taken the wise course of complying with his instructions and called upon him to complete the matter 7x 8e Su ln v? ln to the ;R ' e8ident a letter to tlle address of his son, in charge at Abu Thabi, containing instructions to him to hand over to the Resident or to the Commander of His Majesty's Ship the 20 prisoners remaining at Abu •vr • 1 durailce - ^ letter concluded with the remark that while he Major Cox, feared that the Government of India would be much displeased on hearing of his treatment of the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein, he would be prepared to say what he could in extenuation of Sheikh Zaeed's conduct in view of the latter's final compliance with his advice and instructions. This letter was despatched on the afternoon of 23rd February and 24 hours later Sheikh Zaeed's reply was received. He expressed his inability to oppose the Resident's wishes; sent in the necessary letter for Abu Thabi • and said that he was returning forthwith the camels, rifles and kit of the captured Umm-el-Kowein party; but complained that the terms which Major Cox was prepared to get Umm-el-Kowein to agree to, in order to induce a settlement, were not those which he had hoped for. Meanwhile on this day (24th February) H.M.S. Redbreast had arrived in order to communicate with II.M.S. Froserpine, and the Resident informed TT* 6 tlt 1 ? 1 * fval Officer that there was no further need for the presence of 1 a i rm S ^7. 8 S ^P&gt; but that he would be glad if one of them could proceed to Abu ihabi with the Residency Agent's son and the Sheikh's authorisationand having taken the released pr isoners on board land them at Umm -el- Kowein. At daybreak on the following day H.M.S. Proserpine left for Maskat, and there being too much motion on the Lawrence to make any conduct of business on board possible the Resident landed in order to preside at a further meeting of the Sheikhs of Uium-el-Kowein, Shargah and Debai (the last two also answering for Abu Thabi;. for the formulation if possible of terms for a settlement between them all. The Resident purposely refrained from calling on the Sheikh of Abu Thabi to come in to Shargah as it was necessary that one Sheikh should remain in the field, and had he declined to comply for reasons of caution, or on other grounds, the position would have been made more difficult. After many hours of tedious negotiation the termination of which was in the end expedited as far as the Sheikhs were concerned by the pangs of enforced hunger, conditions were at last formulated, acceptable to all,' and before the meeting separated the three Sheikhs had joined hands and taken the oath of peace in the usual formal manner. It is perhaps hardly likelv that it will last longer than their compacts usually do, but it has brought them all into line for the time and was a satisfactory conclusion to the chapter. Sheikh Rashid of Umm-el-Kowein who had been reasonable and sensible throughout, returned on board the Lawrence with the Resident and was landed by him at his home before dark. He was very grateful for his rescue and received an ovation on his return home ; Umm-el^Kowein being decorated with numerous flags and his relations meeting him with much emotion. After landing him the Lawrence left for Bushire. H.M.S. Redbreast was to leave for Abu Thabi at day-break the following morning (26th February) and it is anticipated that the Umm-el-Kowein retainers will be delivered to her without any difficulty.* A translation of the terms forming the basis of the settlement is appended. •iWwrt/rf.—H.M.S, Redbreast cables from Jask, 2nd March, that the men have been duly released.COHFIIEITIAL.

Judging from the visit naid by the Shaikh of Umm=-uI-Qaiwain to Abu-DhaM the Beni k atab tribe^felt sure that the Chaikh of Umn-ul- Qaiwain will enlist the help of the Rhaikh of Abu-Dhabi I with a view to raakinr war against them. The Beni Katabs have therefore hidden their cattle, animals an^ belonrings in the hills and valleys; and their headman, 'Abdullah bin 'Ali, has visited Debai, n harpah and Ras-ul-Khaimah to renew his alliance with 'the Chiefs of^ those nlaces so that in ♦ / the event of any hostilities breaking out, it may be possible for the Beni Katabs to seek refuge in the territo ries belonging to the said Chiefs. There having existed an alliance between the Beni Katab tribe ^and the Shaikhs, the latter haTzie oromised to use their good offices with the Shaikh of Abu-Dhabi in his behalf. 'Abdullah bin'AH came to see me and stated that thouph the interior of the Arab Coast is safe at nresent, it is certain that the intrigues used by the Shaikh of Urn^ul- Qaiwain will result in war and disturbances and will effect the Arab Coast both internally and externally, because it is sure t^at the inhabitants o f the ^oast wii! sustain losses as soon as there is any breach of the neace .No. r )l dated Oth I!arch 1014.

Again, about 0 months ago, the Shaikh of Sharruh sent his brother, Abdullah bin Ahmad, with a/bout 300 to a village calied ^aid in the interior belonging to Qawasim Shaikhs, to renair its forts, and the Ben F atdb Bedouins gathered there. I learnt that the Shaikh of ay* 1,1 Umm-ul-Qaiwain toH the shaikh of Abu-Dhabi tnat in view of the repairing of the ^aid village, the Oawasira Shaikhs would possibly move against the headman of Fajairah and perhaps the Bedouins of the interior would assist then. He asked the Phaikh o Abu-Dhabi to write letters to warn the headmen of the Bedouins with repard to Fajairah affairs. The Shaikh of Abu-Dhabi wrote letters and sent them to the Shaikh of Umm-ul-0aiwa5n who forwarded them to the headman of Faiairah and the latter sent them on to the headmen of the Bedouins.j I beg to noint out t^at the 0 haikh o' 17 ^m-ul-^s iwain continues to make intrigues against the Oawasim Shaikhs and that these actions will cause trouble in the toV'ns of the Coast and the interior. The Shaikh of Ilmm-u]- Qawain engaged himself wit in a treaty of co-oneration with the Shaikh of Abu-Dhabi for the nurnose of sun^ortinf him against the Oawasim Shaikhs.

Tn the year 10^5 f=l r 08^ the Shaikh of TImm-ul-Oaiwain made interferences with a view to creating trouble fcr the Shaikhs of the ^oast towns from Abu-Dhabi to ^as- ul-Khairnah. lie succeeded in bringing about some dis turbance in collusion with the Eeni Fatab Bedouins, end made intrigues ^xtk in the villages and with the neo r le of the Oaw^sim Government, suizh as ^uiairah, Hemrivveh the ^a'ab Tsland, Pams, Shuam and the neonle of the mountains, so much so that all the Shaikhs of the foast towns were displeased with him, combined, arrested him and wished to kilt him and destroy his town.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf released the Shaikh from the hands of the Shaikhs on an understanding dated 12th vuharram 1??5 .=?5th February 1008\ containing some terms purportinf that Shaikh Hashed should not inter fere with the QawaSim Shaikhs' concerns referred to above. The enmity and quarrel between the Shaikhs anfl Shaikh Rashed bin Ahmad was thus stooped. The understanding was respected by all. During the Chieftainshin of rhaikh Saoar bin kah.lid Rhaikh Rashed's interferences in the said matters were secret and he used to show perfect friendship to Shaikh Saqar. The latter also showed him consideration as the matters «ere , trivial. After Chaikh Gaqsr 's death and my accession in Ms place, I find that rhaikh Rashed is openly interfering with the concerns of the Oawsim Shaikhs. Re firstly showed friend liness to the headman of Fuiairah and thus severed Ms connection with me and frightened him from me. f!econdl-' he interfered in Kemrivyeh to such an extent that as soon as a man from Hemriyyeh is displeased with the headman of the pla« Abdur -fahman bin tiaif, Shaikh 'ashed rives him letter of assurance against the authority of the headman of Remriyyeh. And if there is any claim against them, the matter would be referred to Shaikh Rashed at Umm-ul-Oai'ain. ^or this reason even the headman of Remriyyeh has ioine^ hands with Shaikh Pashed for fear that the latter may turn him out of Remriyveh; Thirdly, Shaikh Rashed interfered with some of the -en of the 'a'ab island and their Readman, Abdullah bin OaMb,_ 1 I I 1 ' -1 Zr \ whom he compelled to oppose my uncle rhai'rh Salim bin r 'uUan, Chief of Pas-ul-Khaimah.

T do not desire to trouble you at this iuncture on such matters, but as Shaikh hashed continues his mischievous intrigues against me and my subiects, it ^.as become necessary for me to inform you so that you may prevent the 0 haikh from interfering with my subiects and villages such as Femriyyeh, Fujairah, Za T ab island and Shu-am and the neonle of the mountains, and that ^ may be in a position to nut their affairs in order and be at ease about Phaikh.

Then both the oarties arrived at .1- I'afair near the valley of I'an and the valley of A 1 - ot — places leadins? to Eatineh— the Bedouins of llsm-ul-Oaiwain halted at the olace before these of Choflah couH reach there. One of the Bedouins of -Oarvain prevented one / q f the Ghoflah from remaining under the shadow o a tree near by. The Bedouins of Ghoiah cau rrh t jh 6 ^an &gt; b r o u r ii ^ hira to his friends^who reprimanded him,and when he was ief' alone he arain attacked the Choflah caravan and be^an throw ing their articles from under the tree in the sun. here upon the Choflah tribesmen hit the man and the two oarties would have fourht if there were not wise men amonr them to separate them. The Choflah Bedouins after conveying their loads to the olace went to their headman and informed him of what had taken olace. The headman came to see the 0 hai ; ch o^ IJmm-ul -Qaiwa in and reported the matter to him. The n hai v h promised to make peace when his bedouins came back. Apam,while the Bedouins of Umm-ul-Oaiwain were leavingBatineh thev 'net tith a caravan of the Cho'lah bounl for Batineh near a olace called yiay belonr'inf to the Eeni .Taben of Batineh, The Bedouin of Unm-ul-Qaiwain.Tho had been beaten by those df Ghof lah,inforned his friends,the Bedouins , of UMM-ul-Qaiwain,of the natter. They ?rave a rood beatinr to the Ghoflah tribesnen. The headnan of the latter -ent to Umm-ul-Qai'Tain and informed the 'haiVh of ''hat had ta'^n place between the Bedouins of Umm-ul-Qai^ain and those of Ghoflah, and ashed Shaikh Hashed to try and make neace between them thereby rerrovin? the ill-feelin?. Phaikh Hashed refused to do this. After some Tnonths the Bedouin of rho r lah n . f ho had been beaten on his camel on the way,met a nan o ' Hnn-ul-r&gt;aiwain&gt; shot him dead and fled to the Bedouins. Then the remainder r of the Ghoflah tribesman were afraid of the fhai^h o .Umr- ul-Qaiwain and -ent to take refuge in far olaces fearinr reprisals. Shaikh Hashed did not entertain any inten ion o marchinc against them,but rather invite^ them to friendship. The headmen of Ghoflah went to wait uoon the Shaikh of Jlbu-Dhabi askin^ him to settle the disoute bet-een them and Shaikh Hashed. Shaikh I'amdan sent one o r his cousins, named Saeed bin Sultan,and surnamed Al-Ghaferi, to Umm-ul- Qaiwain with IB individuals from th^Ghoflah tribesmen. A peace was made between the 1 atter and Shaikh Hashed,Chief of Umm-ul-Qaiwain. The Ghoflah tribesmen '-'ere therefore traveilinp in the country and inetrior of Ilmm-u 1 . - %ai r, ain ,and 'hen n sc. was made between the Chiefs o f ^ibai and Aiman durin^ the recent fifhtinf between them,the headmen of Cho r lah strenftl .ened their relations with n haikh Hashed who entertained some of thera-as guests at Umm-ul-Qaiwain. Three Bedouin headmen o^ 1 Umm-u 1 - ! 'ai'ain '•ent out to the inferior and met with a Ghoflah on the way and shothim dead. The Choflah tribesmen therefore rot frightened of tks Shaikh hashed and deserted to olaces o other tribes such as Beni r atab and Qawasim, Hhaikh hashed then v, ent to Abu-Dhabi to interview Shaikh I'amdan ,Ch ie' o r Abu-^habi, taking with himself the headnan o r the r hawater tribe,the headman of Herariyyeh and r, haikh A iman. n n his return from Abu-Dhabi to IJnm-ul-Qaiwain he at once or ere^ he Bedouins to stoo communication with the Cho p ^ah tribesmen as he intended to fi&lt;rht with them. The latter left their residence in the neighbourhood o r the territories belonrinp' to the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qai-ain. The latter also entertains a prrui^e arainst the Q aw as in ■ Shaikhs and those of Shar^ah and ^as-ul-^haimah or build ing ruined towers at the Dhaid village with stone and morter | while Shaikh 'ashed wishes that the Shaikh o p Sharrah should ^et weak so that he may not cause trouble to the headman of 'uafiairah who is on food terms with the 0 haikh of IJmm-ul-Qaiwain. It is only th-ou^h the Matter's sunnort that the Headman of ^uiairah refuses to show alleriance^ to the Qawasim Shaikhs. It has therefore become really clear to me that it had been prearranged between the n hattkh o^ Ilmm-ul-^aiwain and Abu-Dhabi to send the •■anasir Bedouins and others to all parts of the Coast from Sharcrah 4nd dependencies to ^as-ful -Khaimah. This is the statement of the disoute between the Shaikh of Tjmm-ul-Qaiwain and the Choflah tribesmen. i 1 UuA 'V)t - - -T fl .4l^ -lated October l-l r .

I trust it may be maintained and/ ,/ou /ill keep peace Tamit^ alonp- the coast . I h.Lve however heard a rumour that some suspicions about the jShaikh of Sharg-ah arose in your mind owing to the exp^rte statements of certain headmen of Ghoflah in respect of a lifcpute about camels between them and the Be.ii Katab. It is said that you ancepted the story told by one side accusing the Shaikh of Sharpah of doing cei - tain things, without hearing what the other party had to say. But I cannot think that you would have adopted such a course in view of your unlightenment, and the just methods vhich you must have learnt from r our revered father Shaikh 7aid. I am sure therefore that you have not let the inte rested statements of these biassed parties prejudice you against the Shaikh of shargah. This being so, still more I cannot credit the report that you contemplate an alliance /ith the Sh .ikh of Um^rL- u l-QawavJi against the Jowasim Shaikhs. But as : uch a thing is in peoples mouths I should like to warn you ag ^inst such a ©curse • It 'Ould be a great pity to plunge the trucial coast in war*- especially now-a-days when everybody has sufferred so much from the Grreat European War. I am however convinced that you do not really contemplate ' -yfoontersplate cuah a thing. In view of the talk hov;ever I should he plj-d to hear from you that you do not. I my add that on previous occasions I have had to warn the Shaikh of Uisjul-Qaivaiivahout nisohief 3# making and creating trouble; I fear he has not raended his ways; I thinp- he has not interfe/red in this raattnr and made ill-feelings.

I do not know whether this is true, but I hope not as I have already sent you a warning that it is not good to get UP Q^y attack against the Jfrawasiu Shaikhs. I now write to warn you against doing any such thing, in case the reports are true. Fighting and bloodshed bet ween the Siiaiklis of the Trucial Coast is always bad , but this year, when the Towns have been impoverished and the pearl market made so bad and unstable by the Great war in Europe , disturbances in your parts would be particularly disastrous. So I write as a friend to warn you against war on land. As regards war on the sea of course I should iiave to take steps in concert with the commodore of His Majesty's ships of war to prevent anything of that sort in accordance with the terms of your agreement with the High G-ove^nment.
