These were widely distributed to British ministers, senior officials and military officers in London, India and the Middle East.The copies of the news summaries in this volume were received by the India Office from the Colonial Office. The summaries are also referred to variously as the Persian Gulf news summaries, the Persian Gulf intelligence summaries and the Arab States monthly summaries.This volume contains fifty-six summaries. It begins with No. 1 of 1926, entitled
                           Summary of news from the Arab States for January 1926, dated 6 February 1926, and ends with No. 12 of 1930, entitled
                           Summary of the news from the Arab States for the month of December 1930, dated 25 January 1931.The news summaries use standard subject headings to report the latest developments in the Gulf region, starting with the movements of British officials and non-officials, Arab rulers and notables, followed by the movements of foreigners and the interests of foreign powers in the region. Other subjects regularly reported include aviation and the health of the Arab ports. These topics are followed by country profiles for Bahrein [Bahrain], Kuwait, Qatar, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, the shaikhdoms of Trucial Oman and Bin Saudâ€™s (popularly known as Ibn Saud) kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd.The country profiles report on the activities of rulers and tribes, foreign relations, local government, education, transport and communications, trade and commerce with particular emphasis on pearling and oil concessions, crime, riots and military expeditions.The volume includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (f 4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Intelligence</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial States</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>News flow</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0001e3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
