The major portion of the net is made of two types of blue glazed faience beads: short cylindrical beads and long cylindrical beads. They are strung in a pattern of lozenges.\r\nIn a few cases there are two small beads at the intersection of four long beads.  The cord (string) is made from two strands twisted together. On one of the short ends of the net, and one part of the bottom edge adjacent to this end there is preserved the original fringe of the net. This consisted of an extension, from every other intersection of two long cylindrical beads and of three long beads.\r\nAt the opposite end of the net is preserved part of a different type of border decoration. This is a border formed by stringing, close together, of blue, tan, and white beads. \r\nCondition: Many beads missing and much of original string gone.", "medium": "Faience", "dimensions": "13 x 1/4 x 59 1/16 in.
