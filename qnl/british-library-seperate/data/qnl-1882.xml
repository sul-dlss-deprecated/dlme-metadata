The records cover the years 1351-1353AH (1933-1935). These records include details of the expenditure and budget of the government.The file also contains correspondence that discusses Bahrain's financial situation, notably the economic problems caused by the decline in its pearling industry and the large proportion of its budget allocated to the ruling family's civil list. This correspondence is primarily between Charles Belgrave and the Political Agent in Bahrain, Percy Gordon Loch but the file also contains correspondence (in English and Arabic) between Loch and the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa [Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
