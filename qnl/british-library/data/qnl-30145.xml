The Treasury some months ago drew my attention to the heavy cost of our communications and asked whether anything could be done about it. I accordingly requested the newly-appointed Director of Communications, Brigadier Gambier-Parry, to let me have a report, with recommendations. / 2. A copy of the report, which I have now approved, is enclosed. It is, I am afraid, necessarily rather long but I shall be grateful if you and the appropriate members of your staff will study it carefully. You will see that its two main sections deal with telegrams and bags, respectively, and that a summary of the recommendations is given in the last paragraph. Summary of Report 3. As to telegrams, we hope to be able to cut them down con siderably in number and length (a) by producing time-tables for Foreign Office bags and for the air-mail and ordinary posts so that telegrams shall not be sent when other and cheaper means of communication would v do; (6) by circulating revised instructions enjoining economy; and (c) by maintaining a close scrutiny of telegrams and making sure that the rules are observed. It is really, I think, mainly for lack of strength in the scrutiny staff that our existing rules have largely fallen by the wayside. 4. We hope, too, to be able to effect savings by extending the use of the Diplomatic Wireless Service and, in due course, the relay system for telegrams in suitable cases. The eventual introduction of machine cyphering and decyphering should also, in the long run, produce a great saving in man-power and money. His Majesty’s Representative at m ^0 ' /(/&lt;* ■ &amp; 14430 34411—42J3. In regard to bags, the proposals for economy rest mainly on a reduction of load. In the first place we can curtail the private privilege mail. Subject to special arrangements for certain countries such as those in the Soviet orbit, the report recommends that we should confine the privilege to the staffs of Foreign Service posts and permanent delegations abroad, that privileged mail should travel only by the cheapest (slowest) means, and that the carriage by bag of tobacco, which at present consti tutes a very heavy burden, should cease altogether. We also propose to reduce the quantity of print and to make a drastic cut in the distribu- of print volumes to posts abroad. 6. A further proposal is that all Government Departments should make their own arrangements for the despatch of non-confidential material to our posts. This might perhaps go by the Urgent Government Mail Service. If, as we hope, the service is developed under expert Post Office administration, actual economy should result, quite apart from the saving on our vote. 7. Further economies on the bag service can be effected by curtail ing the runs of King’s Messengers to consulates, with consequent reduc tion in the number or King’s Messengers, and perhaps also by negotiating cheaper rates for the carriage of bags by captains of aircraft. This last point, however, is bound up with the question of security and we are not sure that it will be possible to make anything of it. We intend, however, to make savings by reverting as far as may be practicable to the pre-war system of sending bags by sea, the cost of which is negligible, rather than by air and of using air bags only for urgent material that could not be handled by telegraph or, if it could, would cost more by this means. General Effect of Recommendations 8. In submitting the report to me, Brigadier Gambier-Parry pointed out that, for lack of statistics and for other reasons, he could not set figures, except here and there, against the proposed measures of economy. I agree with him, however, that considerable saving should result from them, both in man-power and in money. I also agree that the measures that he recommends will not impair the efficiency of our communications so far as official material is concerned and that in some respects they should enhance it. They will unfortunately involve some curtailment of the privileged use of the bag for private purposes, but I do not think that in present circumstances we can object to this. If properly applied they will also lead to a general reduction of tempo inthe transmission of official communications. As suggested in para graph 12 of the report, however, it is likely, I think, that only advantage will result from this. Action on the Report 9. I have therefore authorised Brigadier Gambier-Parry to intro duce the various measures recommended in the report and have told him to carry on. This must necessarily be a gradual process. Some of the proposals, however, can be put into force at once and others without much delay. Telegrams 10. In regard to telegrams, we intend shortly to let you have a new booklet of instructions (including revised bag rules also) with time tables attached (see paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report). Until this is available, the recommendations in the report cannot be fully applied. I hope, however, that you will make sure that your staff adhere to existing instructions on this subject and that they will be guided by para graphs 11-13, 16, 18, 22- 24, 34 (last two sentences) and 42 of the report. The purport of these paragraphs may be briefly summarised as follows :— (i) cut down the number and length of telegrams to the bone; (ii) be sparing in the use of priority markings; (iii) do not confuse importance with urgency : the important is usually less urgent than the ephemeral; (iv) do not send an entire message by telegraph (and least of all by priority telegram) or in cypher, if only a part of it is urgent or secret as the case may be : in such cases two separate communications should be sent and one of them, if possible, by despatch or savingram; (v) with effect from 1st January, 1948, introduce the “ lettergram ” (to be so marked) as a deferred telegram (cf. the obsolete “ Dally ”) which would be numbered in the ordinary tele graphic series but would rank after the ordinary telegram in priority and might take up to three days to arrive; (vi) give a further trial to the system of using the prefix “ Light ” on communications that, in your opinion, should be seen by the Secretary of State or an under-secretarv (see my circular letter to Heads of Missions, No. 0103 of Ist August, 1946);4 (vii) ascertain, report and use the cheapest telegraphic routes, which are by no means always the shortest, more particularly when the standing cost of diplomatic wireless is taken into account. Most of the above precepts are of long standing but have not been much honoured of late years save in the breach. We hope now by close scrutiny of all telegrams to be able to enforce them and I trust that for your part you will always draw the attention of Communications Department to cases in which you think that wasteful telegrams have gone out from here. Bag Services 11. The section of the report dealing with bags contains a number of recommendations that can be put into effect without further ado and I shall be glad if, pending the issue of the new bag rules, you will take the following steps :— (i) Official material . —Ensure that nothing is despatched by more costly means than can be j ustified by consideration of urgency, security, or safety (see paragraph 47 of the report). (n) Private mail. Subject to paragraph 56 and to the exception in favour of the correspondence of Heads of Missions in para graph 53— {a) see to it that bags containing private mail travel only by the cheapest route; (5) ensure that the use of the bag for private purposes is withheld from unauthorised persons (see para graph 54) and furnish and maintain lists as requested for use in the Foreign Office; (c) arrange, if necessary, that tobacco (see paragraph 55) shall not be sent to the Foreign Office for transmission by bag. 12. If you consider that, under the terms of paragraph 56, any of the above steps would be unreasonable, having regard to the conditions m the country m which you reside, you will no doubt let us know and make out a case for exceptional treatment, saying in precisely which respect this is needed. I feel sure, however, that you will not ask for an&gt; lelaxation of the general rule unless you are satisfied that it is essential from the point of view of the welfare and efficiency of yourS ^ a ^’ / ou observe that, in any case, the correspondence of any of out officials in the Soviet orbit must travel by confidential hag. 13. Ihe recommendations in paragraphs 60-66 relating to (1) a reduced circulation of print, (2) the abolition of the Weekly Political ntelligence Summary, and (3) a revised form of ‘ ‘ intel ’ ’ are now being put into force. As a general rule, “ intels ” will be despatched weekly in the form of savingrams by bag, but this service will be supplemented by ordinary telegrams as circumstances may require. 14. The security arrangements referred to in paragraph 67 of the report are not primarily a communications matter and will be dealt with separately. In view of them, however, copies of the enclosed report are not being sent to consuls under your superintendence. I am nevertheless sending them copies of this circular letter for their guidance and shall be glad if you will show them the report as opportunity offers. 15. As I have said, further instructions on the implementation of the report will follow and I am sure that you will do what you can at a stages to impress on your staff the real need to follow the instructions closely and to do everything possible to effect economv. As you know our position m regard to foreign exchange is such that drastic cuts in our expenditure abroad must be made. T nless we can sufficiently curtail the cost of our ancillary services, we shall be unable to avoid reductions in staff or m the standard of living of our representatives to a point where the functions of our missions and consulates can no longer be discharged either adequately or without discomfort. -f AT™ f ^ Alii* '• i i t 16.
