[P 12341 From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2(jlh March 1917. (Repeated to Sir P. Cox.) I JIT*' All 0 ''' I tell!gra,n 0f ,h r 17tl i M . ar&lt;!h - Civil Administration of hagdad Although paramount direct British administration may not he contemplated it seems essential that apart from martial law which can mcroly maintain order steps should be taken to overhaul and replace defunct I ur kish administration and to carry on work of civil Departments. For this ^m'd^tlint ''''^rstand suitable Arab personnel is not immediately available, an that onus must fall for the time being at any rate on British Officers. The 'inmediate requirements appear to he— V' To f cure submission by political means of tribes between Kut-el- Amara and our Iront line and later between Xut-el-Amara and jNasinvah and settle them on accustomed lands on revenue payine basis. Latter is of course mostly in Basra Vilayet, but we mention it to show full requirements. (2) To overhaul and replace civil Departments of Vilayet of Bagdad. Kor (1) a few military Assistant Political Officers will be required and we propose to send snch suitable Officers as are available from India. We have already sent Major Bailey of Political Department. May we use our (nscretion up to, say eight more Officers? For (2) an experienced Revenue 'racer with a stall of two or three Officers acquainted with Arabic and if possible rurkish are required. If Dobbs is willing to return to Mesopotamia, and his health admits, we propose to send him. If not we propose Holme of olit'oal Department. ()ne or two &lt; )fficers from Egypt or London would be useful in this capacit}-. Further we propose to send Holland on completion of Trade Report to asra as ('ox's deputy, Wilson moving up to Bagdad in similar capacity. 13 J'rom Secretary of State to I iceroy, Foreign Department, iiOlJi March 1917. 1315j 1 ok ign becret. ( ommittee of \\ ar ( abinet has considered measures for future administration and Political control of Mesopotamia and Arabia, and has reached conclusions of which following is summary : (1) Occupied territories to be administered not by Government of India but by His Majesty's Government. (2) Hasra to remain permanently under British administration; western and northern limits to be Nasiryeh, Shatt-el-Hai, Kut, Bedrai. (3) Bagdad to be an Arab state with local ruler or Government under British Protectorate in everything but name. Thus it will have no relations with Foreign Powers, and Consuls will be accredited to His Majesty's Government. (4) Behind Arab facade Bagdad to be administered as an Arab Province by indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions as far as possible. In particular (a) Trak Code not to be used but local judicial system maintained as regards both law and personnel, only substi tuting Arab for Turk; {h) similarly with executive and administrative machinery, tribal system of &lt; Government, provincial and local councils &amp;c to be resuscitated and maintained ; {c) present land revenue system not to he disturbed ; (d) employment of Indians in any branch of administration to be strictly discountenanced as inconsistent with above principles and no Asiatics from outside to be employed unless of Persian or Arab descent or domicile. The same to apply as far as possible to Basra Vilayet OT 183t) (5) If Basra is not annexed, head of whole Mesopotamian administration to be High Commissioner residing at Bagdad, Basra being placed under a Governor subordinate to him. If Basra is annexed head of administration to be styled Governor of Basra and High Commissioner for Mesopotamia with titular headquarters at Basra, but residing generally at Bagdad. Deputy Governor and Deputy High Commissioner at Basra and Bagdad respectively to act for him in his absence. (6) British Civil Service to be amalgamated with that of Soudan and possibly also of Levant, recruitment being by same method and personnel inter changeable. British oflicers of Indian services, if required at first, to be lent temporarily under foreign service rules, and those now serving there to be permitted to volunteer for permanent transfer. (7) Shiah holy places to form separate enclave not under direct British control, care being taken not to include in it any important irrigated or irrigable areas. (8) Control of irrigation in botli Vilayets to be under single British administration and similarly with navigation and conservancy of rivers. (9) Koweit and whole Arabian littoral of Persian Gulf including Oman to be controlled by Basra. (10) Aden and Hadramaut to be taken over by Foreign Oflice. (11) South Persia including Arabistah and Pars to be sphere of influence of Government of India. Lastly —It is regarded of utmost importance that administrative arrange ments introduced into Bagdad Vilayet should from the very outset strictly conform to above principles. Please instruct Cox to this effect at once with speeial reference to Head I, and telegraph with least possible delay any remarks you may wish to make on any of these heads for consideration of War Cabinet before they reach final decision. From Sir P. Cox, 7th April 1917. {Addressed to (Government of India, repeated to Secretary of State for India, and Political, Basra.) I . 1019. ^ our telegram 41GS. of 1st April repeating Secretary of State's telegram of 29th March for the future administration of Mesopotamia. 1 beg to offer following observations in regard to details :— 1. No comment needed from me, t &gt; . 1 agree. o. Ruler will (s/c V not) be acceptable or feasible as 1 know of no outstanding personality who could fill part. An Administrative Council presided over by High Commissioner seems best solution, either one for each vilayat or a combined one for both vilayats. 4 (a). 1 agree that the territory should be administered in accordance with existing laws and institutions, and I am moreover convinced that there would be great advantage in having uniform codes for Basra and Baghdad and other Arab provinces under foreign rule or protection. The Ira(| code has served its purpose well, but it is admittedly provisional and revocable on the conclusion of war, and whatever be the final political status of Basra, there seems to be no essential reason why systems established in both yilayats should not be assimilated. It must be remembered that 1 urkish judicial system included final reference to Constantinople for which substitute must be found by creation of High Court of Mesopotamia with linal appeal to Privy ( ouncil. Incidentally also the civil and criminal codes and land laws will require considerable amendment and adjustment of woiding to make them interpretable at all. As regards substitution ot Arab for 1 urkish personnel, there is not sufficient indigenous materia) available at present, but it can gradually be created. 4 (6). liibal system of government already adopted where suitable, and no objection to provincial and local councils. 4 (r). I agree in principle.&gt; 4 {d).I agree m proposition, but for duration of war we must have some latitude, especially in regard to clerical establishments. Urgent reonire mentsof Expeditjonary Force and military administration cannot wait and have to be met I)y the most expeditious means possible. 5. Of course in priiieiple it would be much more satisfactory to have the Basra and hagndad \ dayats administered on one cohering (?) svstem both in legaid to piinciplc and detail. Hut 1 know that on the one hand we cannot annex both, and on the other hand the importance of annexing Basra makes it necessary to put up with certain disadvantages which that course may involve. 1 feel convinced, however, that no attempt to differentiate funda mentally m regard to working principles and details of two administrations will produce satisfactory results, and that they should be so similar as to be indistinguishable in the working. The difference would be one of technical political status and nomenclature which need not make itself felt on the sput. ^ lo attempt to i mi the two vilayats, which &lt;ire Irom every point of view inseparable, on conflicting lines and inconsistent principles would, I am sure, resulf in great prejudice to all interests concerned. 6. Ko comment or objection. 7. Xejef and Kerbela should not be treated as an enclave cut off from advantages resulting to united Mesopotamia from enlightened Government, which advantage inhabitants anticipate with lively expectation and will assuredly demand. They should, be organised as independent townships as far as municipal administration is concerned ; while unable at present to form an opinion as to irrigation, river conservancy, navigation, posts, telegraphs and railways, they should come under united Mesopotamia administration controlled by High Commissioner. Limits of townships would be existing limits of sacred territory round shrines. Both towns should be represented on Mesopotamian Administrative Council which would combine Vilayat Counoils of both Vilayats and would' sit at Baghdad. The divergent local and tribal interests of each vilayat would blend or fall inlo their true perspective in this Council and Indian immigration and cognate questions would be more easily disposed of since the right of united administration to regulate such questions in accordance with need of whole country would be unquestionable. The towns themselves, apart from precincts of the Holy Places, have always been open to Europeans and would continue to be so in future, but any officials which the Government or the Municipalities intend to place in residence there should be Mohammedans agreeable to communities concerned. 8. 1 entirely concur. These are two vital matters and incalculable harm may be done by injudicious or inexpert handling of them. 9 and 10. No comment. 11. 1 am strongly of opinion that sphere of Government of India in Persia should include whole of present neutral zone phis farthest limit of Kermanshah and Ispahan if possible. 12. It will be seen from the foregoing that I generally accept and agree with the lines of policy contemplated by War Council. The task of carrying it out if one of no little difficulty would be one of great interest, and were I called upon to inaugurate it at the psychological moment I feel I could enter on it whole-heartedly, and suppose for a moment that His Majesty's Government did or were to contemplate entrusting me with task I should highly appreciate compliment and confidence which it would imply, but I should let them know now, as the Government of India are already aware, that while anxious like anybody else to see the war through in whatever sphere my services could be most usefully employed, I have never desired and do not desire to remain in this country after tlie war, and, moreover, 1 feel sure that new policy stands a better chance if it were inaugurated by official who is going to remain and see it taking shape. Both Army Commander and I, however, are strongly of opinion that when His Majesty's Government contemplate formally introducing above principles during the existence of martial law, and while the militarv position of Baghdad is as it is namely, that we are in almost daily conflict with Arab tribes ahead of us, and that unless determined Russian advance is made, of which at present there is no evidence, we must expect severe OT 483 A 2 -4 fightino- around Baghdad when enemy has had time to recover and concentrate fresh troops against ns), tliey are taking too much for granted, and are making demands upon ns which maj^ at any time, and in many particulars, be incompatible both with the military interests at stake and the freedom of action of Army Commander, whose Chief Political Staff Officer \ am. At same time His Majesty's Government may rest assured that 1 accept their policy in principle, and that as long as I am here I will proceed on the spirit of it as far as possible and do nothing which I can avoid either in principle or in detail to prejudice its complete inauguration when the time comes. Army ( ommander desires me to convey similar assurance on his behalf. 13. For the present I recommend that Chief Political Officer be permitted to carry on according to his lights in consultation with Army Commander as heretofore, and that as soon as conditions permit, say at the beginning of next cold weather, a Commission of lirst-class men be spared to examine whole problem on the spot, and make detailed recommendations as basis on which future policy can be formulated. Premature conclusions arrived at now may do irreparable damage, and it is submitted that only greatest emergency can justify hasty decision by War Cabinet before His Majesty's Government are in possession of complete facts and details regarding Baghdad Vilayat. From Sir F. Cox, Stli April 1917. {Addressed to Foreign and repeated to Secretary of State for India and Political, Basra.) (Received at India Office, 0 a.m., Oth.) [P 1433 T. 1(&gt;62. Reference to telegrams from the Secretary of State, dated 30th March and 8th April. May I please be informed of names, ages, and number of years' service of proposed Judicial Adviser and the two sub ordinate Revenue Officers ? I presume they are all Englishmen and belong to Civil Service. A competent Judicial Adviser is already available in -Colonel Knox, who has had two years' experience of local judicial needs .and ideas, and as it is common ground that Irak Code is not to be introduced and as he is quite prepared to work on the lines indicated by His Majesty's Government, it seems superfluous, apart from Colonel Knox's personal claims to consideration, to introduce another legal luminary. On the other hand, couple of capable junior judicial Officers who could assist him in over hauling Turkish codes would no doubt be very useful. As regards Brigadier- General Clayton, his services would at any time be most valuable to me as well as to Government, but 1 suggest that his designation be not decided until His Majesty's Government have had time to consider views of Army Commander and myself as conveyed in my telegram 1049 dated 7th April. Draft of proposed telegram to Viceroy. (To he repeated to Sir P. Cox.) Cox's telegram of 7th April. Mesopotamia administration. His Majesty * Government did not contemplate immediate establishment of an Arab administration on principles indicated in their telegram of 29th March. They fully realise that military situation requires that Army Commander and Chief Political Officer should have free hand, but what they are con cerned about is that nothing that can be avoided should be done during military occupation that would make introduction of above -mentioned- '• ll i principles more difficult afterwards. Only such minimum of administrative clficieucj should he aimed at as is necessary to preserve order and meet needs of oscnpying force. Amendment of laws and introduction of reforms should he kept withm narrowest possible limits. Personnel hoth of higher tranches ami clerical .establishment should be limited to immediate require ments, and should not ordinarily be drawn from India unless and until it ias )een ascertained that kgypt and Soudan cannot supply them ills Majesty e Government hope that Chief Political Officer will devote Jih own attention principally to opening up and developing political relations indicated m my telegram of 24th March and to organising widespread anti-luikish increment to co-operate with our operations in Palestine I will address you further about Clayton and officers from Egypt.
