In a telegram of 25th May the Govt, of India informed us that Lincoln was about to proceed on 5 months* leave on medical certificate, but that on his return they proposed, as a measure of economy, that he should continue to hold charge at Mohammerah. I infer that the intention is that Capt.Gastrell shall hold the post temporarily; but if you think that the Foreign Office would desire a definite statement we can telegraph to India for it. We have more than once asked that this information should be given on every occasion of the kind. Yours sincerely, (SD)H.tf.GARRETT* TIMDraft Paper.COPY OF TELEGRAM.

We are not in a position to say whether the expenses of his actual journey from England to Kashgar via the Russian Railway would have been covered by this sum. But having regard to the circumstances of the case we are of opinion that Colonel Kennion may equitably be reimbursed the cost of his passage to Mohammerah up to a limit of £61. In order that we may be enabled to issuo the necessary orders in this connection, we would request that we may be informed of the cost of the passage which was taken for him by the India Office.

If these are the facts, Colonel Kennion would seem to have suffered financially from rearrangements which were due to causes over which he had no control; and in the circumstances I am prepared, with the concurrence of Your Excellency’s Government, to waive the objections raised in Sir A.

GNULOSURE No. I :—Lnd ia Office to Lieut-Colonel Kenruon. P. 819. ludia Office, Sir, 11th March 1915u I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Pouncil to inform yon, in confirmation of demi-official communications made to you from this i Mhce, that it has been decided to recall you at once from leave to take up the appointment of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah in succession to Major A. P. Trevor, 0.1.E., who has been transferred to Bushire. The War Office have been requested to release you from your duties as Interpreter with the Indian Expeditionary Force, and it is understood that you have received a communication from them terminating your services in that capacity. You should accordingly proceed to Mohammerah and take over charge of His Majesty’s Consulate with the least possible delay. You will be allowed to take the balance of your leave unexpired at the date of commencement of your employment under the War Office, together with any leave otherwise admissible to you, as soon as you can be spared from duty. For the period of ycur voyage to India you will be granted leave allowances, and for the period from the date of landing in India to the date, of joining your appointment such allowance as you would have drawn under tin' orders of the Government of India if you had not been recalled but had simply returned on the termination of your leave. In view, however, of the fact that the date up to which you were originally granted leave by the Government of India has already passed, and that it is understood that your recall to duty has not caused you incon venience, the Secretary of State for India in Council regrets that he is unable to sanction the grant to you of a passage to India at the public expense. The Foreign Office have been requested to arrange for the issue in your favour of the necessary Consular powers. 1 have, &amp;c., Lieut.-Colonel R. L. Reunion, A. Hirtzel. &amp;c., &amp;c. ENCLOSURE No. 2 : —Lieut.-Colonel Kennion to India Office. S.S. “ Kaisar-i-Hind,' 15th March 1915. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. P. 819/15, dated 1 Ith March 1915, and to report that in accordance with the instructions therein contained, I left London in this steamer on the 13th March, to take up my appointment at Mohammerah. With reference to the decision communicated to me that my passage to India will not be at public expense, 1 would respectfully submit the following explanations and remarks :— The le ave originally granted me was for six weeks only from the 8th June, at the conclusion of which I was to proceed to Kashgar. For the expenses ol this journey, I was to receive travelling allowance, computed liom the Malakand, my last station ; while in order that my arrival at Kashgar should coincide with the commencement of Sir George Macartney’s leave, my joining time was extended to the 20th September. Owing to the outbreak of war, my appointment to Kashgar was cancelled. My post at the Malakand had in the meantime been tilled up, and the six weeks’ leave granted me (which would not have constituted a break in my service) had been exceeded. I accordingly, and with a view to volunteering 254*. A 216086.-2. I. 1638. 2000.—11/1913. (&amp;&gt; Reference Paper. Political and Secret 1 Department, j Letter No. IO&lt;j 2&gt; Eec. 21^ 191^.

Lieutenant-Colonel Kennion called on me before he sailed and gave me to understand, though it is not definitely stated in his letter, that the travelling allowance he would have received in respect of his journey from the Malakand to Kashgar wouii have more than covered uhe expenses of ms j ourney from England to Kashgar via the Russian railway. He further stated that had itnot been for the expectation of receiving, travelling allowance on this basis he would not have taken the short period of Privilege Leave in England that expired on the 20th July. This being so, I think Lieutenant-Colonel Kennion has been badly hit by the rearrangement which resulted from the outbreak of war and the cancellation of his appointment at Kashgar. It is not possible here to state what Lieutenant-Colonel Kennion’s travelling allowance for the journey from the ‘alakand to Kashgar (which would have been partly by rail and partly by road) would have amounted to, ’out if the facts are as indicated above, I think, as a special case, that free passage to India might be allowed him. I would suggest that the fact* should be brought to the notice of the Government of India,and that if thev support Lieutenant-Colonel Kennion’s contention, they should be authorised to issue passage allowance to him. u1 0 9 3 P&amp; O.S.N.Co.

With reference to tne decision communicated to me tnat my passage to India will not be at public ex cense, I would respectfally submit the f(flowing explanations and remarks: Tne leave originally grantee me was for six weeks only from the 6th June, at the conclusion of which I was to oroceed to Kashgar. For the expenses of this journey, I was to receive Travelling allowa nee , computed from tne Malakand, my last station', wnile in order inat my arrival at Kasngar should coincide with the commencement of Sir leorge macartneys leave, my joining time was extended to the 20th September. Owing to the outbreak of war, my appointment to Kashgar was cancelled. My post at the kalakand had in the meantime been filled up, and the six weeks leavegranted &gt;»e, (tihioh jjoald not have oondtitated a oreaX in mg eervioe), had been exceeded. I accordingly, and with a view to volunteering mg eer ices m connection witn the war, applied tnat mg privilege leave -e-e be converted to nine montns combined leave. It will be underatood that the outoreah oj war thus caused me to exceed the si: weeks privilege leave I had taken and also put me in the position of aaving to pay my own passage bac'z to India. I may incidentally mention that 1 was also put to some expense in providing myself with outfit for Kashgar and tnat I did not, as I should hue ~one if I had been expecting to return to India, provide myself with a return ticket. If ind ed it had not been for the assurance that I should ve entitled to Travelling allowance to Kashgar at the expiry of my leave, I should not /iave taken leave avail at tnat time. In your letter under reference, the second reason for my passage to India not being provided at public expense is stated to be that it was understood that Qy. my return to duty had not caused me inconvenience. In this regard I would submit that I asked to be sent to the Persian lulf because I felt that I should oe more&lt;§&gt; P&amp;O.S N. Co.
