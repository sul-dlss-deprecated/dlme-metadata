It is not so with nations : they cannot with safety allow themselves to be outgrown in strength by neighbouring States, because the wealth and possessions of the people may be endangered by the power and ambition of aggressive neighbours. There is no law to which nations can appeal: for the law of nations never yet protected the weak, nor checked the aggressions of the strong. This is saying nothing of the natural property which every citizen holds in the power and greatness of his country, the heritage of honour to which he is born, and the preservation of which he has a right to demand from the government under which he lives.'— Lieutenant -Colonel Mitchell.FOREIGN POLITICS AND ENGLAND'S FOREIGN POLICY. The subject I propose to discuss on this occasion is Foreign Politics and England's Foreign Policy; and, before doing so, I wish to impress upon those present that this is not a matter which should be treated, as it usually is, as a question of party, but should be examined in its broadest and most important sense, viz., as a great national question, for it is one which concerns and ought to interest all parties alike, whether Tory or Kadical; it is one on the treatment of which must depend the future welfare, greatness, nay, the very existence of this great empire itself; let us then lay aside for the moment all prejudices of party and calmly con sider the matter before us. I regret to say that this is a subject little attended to or studied by any class of our fellow-countrymen, and there fore is very little understood by them; the vast importance the foreign policy of England may have on her future welfare and greatness and the commercial prosperity and wealth of her citizens is, consequently, I fear, not at all realized by the country at large. Our ignorance generally of foreign nations, habits, customs, trains of thought, &amp;c., is' surprising when we consider the great means of inter-communication which now exist as compared with those enjoyed by our forefathers at the commencement of this century:—wrapped up in the seclusion of our island home, trusting to that strip of silver [292] B 2sea we hear so much of, busy with our various occupations and industries, which supply the world with so many of its comforts and necessities—we trouble ourselves but little with what the continental nations of Europe think of us, our sayings, or our doings. Yet it is a wholesome thing, both for nations and individuals, to look at themselves through some one else's spectacles besides their own; and, I must admit, I have often felt very deeply the remarks I have heard made on the Con tinent regarding the selfish policy of Great Britain during the last few years. We have been at so much trouble to make the world believe the worst of us, however, that we must not feel surprised if Europe takes us at our own word and thinks hardly of us. The burden of our song has always been that it is no business of ours. We are not going to be dragged into war for other people's quarrels, and that the right policy for England is 'Peace at any Price.' I venture to think this self-effacing conduct must always end in the same way. Having persuaded European nations that nothing would induce us to fight, we ought not to be surprised if one day any Power who wanted to gain some advantage for itself in the way of which we stood, were to try and remove us from its path; whereas, had that country known we should allow no such liberty to be taken with impunity, or had we acted up to the words of our Scotch motto, 'Nemo me impune lacessit,' such Power would never have thought of the aggressive act. It was by such policy on our part, we haited the Emperor Nicholas into the Crimean War. Had he known we really intended to resist vi et armis, nothing would have induced him to have committed so serious a mistake as to go to war with us, with his military communications in the state they were then in, without a military railway in the country. Having done all we could do to make the Eussian believe that we should not fight, the Emperor picked a quarrel with Turkey. Suddenly England woke up, rubbed her eyes, and said, ' Holloa, what's all this ? AVe're going to fight; we won't stand this.' It was too late for the Emperor to recede; he was committed to his forward movement, and, as the Turks had made a gallant resistance, and checked the advanceJ of the Eussian troops, lie was more than ever forced to con tinue the struggle. If for a moment Mr. Gladstone's proposal for a special vote for the conveyance of the guards to Turkey convinced him we had taken the matter au strieux, and caused him to pause, his apprehensions were soon removed, for a few lines further he saw that a sum was asked, not only for the conveyance of the troops to the seat of war, but also for their conveyance home again. Naturally, the Czar thought the whole affair beneath contempt, and was more than ever con vinced that we did not intend seriously to interfere with his projects. And, indeed, how could the commander of the largest army in Europe imagine that England seriously thought that the military promenade of a handful of troops in Turkey would stop him (the Czar) doing what he chose, and for which he had been long preparing. Those men in this country who allow the position of England to be lowered in the eyes of Europe by their miserable time-serving, un- statesmanlike conduct, prepare for us a fearful day of reckon ing ; when we no longer hold that place among the Powers of Europe to which we are entitled by our history, our position, our wealth, and power, we shall have questions which greatly affect our interests decided without our opinion being asked, and it will eventually oblige us to re-assert ourselves as our forefathers had to do before us, by force of arms. It was not by such narrow-minded, selfish conduct (for statesmanship I will not call it) that the England we are all so proud of became what she is. Such men as these never conquered the I ndian Empire, or took and defended Gibraltar against the united arms of France and Spain for nigh a century. These men never had the far-seeing energy to people the vast continents of America and Australia with the Anglo-Saxon Colonies. Such small minds never pushed our commerce into the ports of China and Japan, or explored the vast regions of Africa and Asia, unknown hitherto to civilization. No, these men would retire from the great position our grand old British pluck, whether in arms or commerce, has won for us, they would give up India, they would leave our loyal Canadian brothers to shift for themselves and force them to become Yankees hon gri, mal grt. They would let Russia6 absorb Constantinople, and destroy our old ally the Empire of Austro-Hungary. And they would as calmly look on if France occupied Belgium and Antwerp to-morrow, ever with the cry on their lips, ' Oh, it's no concern of ours; it's all right, it will last our time, and aprbs nous h dAluge.' And yet these men venture to call themselves statesmen ! ! I admit statesmanship in a constitutional country is not an easy role to play well. Statesmanship means a policy which is far-seeing, and the doing certain things apparently useless or disagreeable at the present moment for a great benefit hoped to be obtained hereafter. Sound statecraft is good husbandry,—you sow as you hope to reap in the fulness of time. The present policy is sowing the storm, for we shall reap the whirlwind. The government of a constitutional country is often too apt to think of what will make them popular to-day at no matter what cost to the State hereafter; hence, instead of educating public opinion so as to enable it to rise to the level of the importance of a subject and to be a competent judge of a question, they lower themselves and their acts to the level of popular ignorance. This is most pernicious, and pandering to ignorant clamour, led and fostered by professional agitators. I hold it to be the bounden duty of the Government of a country constituted as England is at present, where the popular element is so strongly represented, to systematically inform the public, by the various means they possess, of the previous history of, the actual points, advantages, and disadvantages, together with future probable results of, any great question of foreign policy. The common sense of the English people, if properly informed on the facts, will rarely go wrong, and will be a beacon of light to guide the bark of State through the troublous waters of foreign policy. But this sort of course does not suit the class of statesmen and politicians to whom I refer—they have their own ends to serve—or those of their party, and the real good of the country, and its national honour and prestige are sacrificed. The country is paraded, and these gentry go on the stump, and by garbled statements of the case, suppressing facts here, and adding flights of imagination there, they so mislead the public, who have no7 means, as a rule, of testing the truth of what is stated to them, that a so-called public opinion is whipped up into a state of effervescence, and made to pass muster for the ex pression of the wish of the people. Whether it is a man living by the work of his hand, or a man living by the work of his brain—peer, commoner, or working man—I shall never be afraid of appealing to any or all of them when the honour, freedom, and power of the old country is concerned, provided only they have a fair opportunity of hearing the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and I venture to assert, without fear of contradiction, that the education of the constituencies of this country, as regards questions of foreign policy, is the duty of all parties alike ; and that the national greatness of England will be impaired by keeping the classes now electing the governing power of the country in the state of ignorance they have hitherto been in on this subject. Last century and the commencement of this was a time of war and bloodshed. Man, at last, seemed unable to bear the burden any longer, and the statesmen of Europe of that day—than whom no men could have more experience—met in solemn council in Vienna, and by Treaty established that which has been known as the Balance of Power in Europe. It was the fashion twelve or fifteen years since for your politician of the period to sneer at our forefathers, their Treaties, and the balance of power established by them ; they sneered at the very principle of the balance of power. Now I ventured then to resist this tone with all my energy. I felt that unless there was a strong public international sense of honour, a confidence in the security and inviolability of solemn Treaties between nations, chaos must return again. ' o The late Emperor Napoleon naturally felt himself called upon, out of regard to the memory of his uncle and that uncle's rule, to systematically scoff at and complain of the Treaties of 1815, which the French nation were taught to believe were a standing shame to them, and an overwhelming burden, too heavy for them long to bear. I&gt;ut Napoleon knew better than to take the bull by the horns. He had succeeded in making England France's ally, and during two years of a terrible war had cemented their alliance by inter-8 mingling the blood of the two nations on many battle-fields. The Ehine frontier, or annexation of Belgium, would, he well knew, aA\ aken every dormant feeling of the Anglo-Saxon, and the old enmity between England and France would blaze out more strongly than ever. He therefore preferred arriving at the object he had in view, viz., the rectification of France's frontier, by a more circuitous but safer route. In Cavour— the Machiavelli of modern times, who, like his great master in the art of diplomacy, held that the end justified all means used in Cavour he found a ready coadjutor, whose one thought was the unity of Italy. The Emperor knew Eng land's weakness for ' oppressed nationalities' how readily she lent a sympathizing ear to the imaginary soitows of Huns, Greeks, Poles, or Italians; and he saw that the best way to attack the fortress of the balance of power in Europe, and the Treaties of 1815, was by aiding Victor Emmanuel to wrest Milan from Austria, into whose hands the Lombardo- Venetian kingdom had been consigned for the benefit of Europe. England generally hailed the success of the Franco- Italian arms with acclamation, but the public press entirely changed these exulting cries when they saw the little game unfolding itself. The price Victor Emmanuel had to pay the Emperor for his assistance was the birthplace of his house, Nice and Savoy. It was thus Napoleon rectified the frontier of France in her south-eastern corner. We screamed and o )jected, and said it was all very wrong; but we soon saw that we had been overreached, we were judged out of our own mouth, and we could really say nothing now that our arguments were turned against ourselves. We had re-echoed the cry, that indeed the balance of power, as laid down by the Treaty of Vienna, was an anachronism, and that nation alities had the right to elect their own rulers by plebiscite, C' y ilJS suited us so long as Italy and Austria were con cerned ; but we did not quite relish it so much when we realized that our arguments were double-pointed, and that which was right for Milan must also be for Nice and Savoy, The farce of a plebiscite was gone through in those isolated provinces, and they were annexed to France An old French proverb says, ' Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coftte '9 The Treaties of Vienna having been torn up, first by allowing a Napoleon to sit on the French Throne, then by the wresting of Milan from Austria, it was absurd to complain if they went a little further and rectified the frontier of France. Well, since that great and sacred principle of public faith and honour, resting on solemn Treaties, has been broken, what has been the state of the world ? We all lived for many, many years in such a state of profound peace, that the period had come to be called the Fifty Years' Peace; and I remember, when I was a little boy of eight years old, how my mother introduced me to an old white-headed soldier, who had served through the war in the Peninsula and the crowning glory of Waterloo, I remember her saying, ' This foolish little boy must needs be a soldier. I tell him the time has gone by for fighting, and it is of no use to be a soldier! and the veteran answered, putting his hand on my head, 'No, my little man, I don't recommend soldiering now-a-days. Men have grown too wise to fight; there will be no more war in the world !' He was right as far as he was concerned, for he died before the temple of Janus was again opened. And what have we seen since the long Peace? Wars ceaseless in India; wars in China, in 1842, 1857, and 1860; the Crimean War; the Indian Mutiny; the French and Austrian War; the Spanish- Moorish War; the American War; the Russian-Polish War; the Mexican Revolution and War; the Brazilian War; the Prussian, Austrian, and Danish War; the Prussian, Austrian, and Italian AVar; and last and greatest, the Prussian-French War. So long as the balance of power was preserved, and public Treaties respected, we avoided these horrors, but once the dam was removed— hella, horrida bella —nothing but wars ensued; and I venture to think that our forefathers, whose wise statesmanlike judgment laid down those Treaties which gave us half a century of peace, were not the fools it has been often the habit of inferring they were. I go further, it is my conviction that we are only now half through the fearful ordeal of blood. We have now succeeded in tearing open all the wounds which a long peace had partially healed. We liud I ranee in a state of deadly antagonism to Germany; Austria and Hungary against Russia, with probably Germany10 as her future ally; Spain in a state of clironic revolution. One wound only is not yet opened, and that is the rivalry between France and England, but that may at any time come by the alliance of Russia and France. And I believe we can hope for no settled peace until Europe, fainting from loss of blood, as she was at the beginning of this century, sees the absolute importance of establishing some international code of protection and honour, and again discovering a balance of power suited to the actual state of affairs. Till that event arrives, I see nothing but war clouds chasing each other along the horizon of the future. There are modern statesmen who will tell you that there is nothing like arbitration; it is their specific for all the ills that nations are heir to—especially valuable in cases where you know you are perfectly right, both in law and equity. We lately had two notable instances of the sound ness of the views of these gentlemen. Was England ever made such a fool of as she has been in these two American awards ? The one bright spot in the whole mire-coloured complexion of the affair is the profound judicial ability and independent conduct of Sir Alexander Cockburn. Your self-effacing, peace-at-any-price gentry would also advise you to surrender Gibraltar, Malta, &amp;c., as they have already done Corfu. But if ever you hear such rampant rubbish talked, open your understandings and examine the question for yourselves. These gentlemen will, of course, tell you that it is so wrong our holding Gibraltar, that we ought to do as we would be done by, &amp;c., that it is Spain's, and ought to be given up to her. Had they said it was the property of Morocco they would have been nearer the truth. The Moors occupied Gibraltar in 811, and the Spaniards were never able to wrest it from them—to keep it—until the close of the fifteenth century. In 1704 the English Admiral, Eooke, sur prised and took it during the War of the Succession; and since we have had it, not all the united efforts of France and Spain have ever been able to take it from us. It was ours by light of conquest, and has been confirmed to us by Treaty. We have had it in our possession now very nearly as long as it was in the hands of Spain. They will then tell you that it11 is useless! Certain naval men are especially fond of this theory, on the grounds that the harbour of Gibraltar is exposed to bad weather sometimes. But if the harbour of Gibraltar is not perfectly protected against bad weather, or the guns of long range at Algesiras, it is our own fault for not com pleting a harbour on the eastern side at Europa Point. Plans are in existence showing how this could be done, with little difficulty, and then our largest ships could lie both out of sight and perfectly protected from any weather. They ignore one very important fact. If we had not possession of Gibraltar, who would ? And if another Power had it, what use would they put it to—would it not most probably be used to our greatest disadvantage and prejudice ? I am sure we should find it, not a passive neutrality, but an active evil. Besides this, we have no option in the matter; England is not represented by this group of islands; she is a vast nation, on whose territories the sun never sets, and, of consequence, she must be the first naval Power in the world. In these days of steam, the first source of power to England is the possession of numerous coaling and strategical naval stations along her great highways of communication connecting the various portions of her vast dominions. Now, coaling stations, such as I refer to, are absolutely useless in war, unless they are so strong that they can stand alone for a certain time, and resist a coup de main, should an enemy's squadron attack them during the temporary absence of the fleet. Gibraltar and Malta exactly represent such stations, for they may be said to be practically impregnable if properly armed and defended. The value of them was fully understood by Napoleon I, who, by the Treaty of Tilsit, in 1807, stipulated that we were to be deprived of them. There is another point regarding the value to us of such places, which these folk utterly ignore. Since the introduction of steam, we have had no real naval war. The nearest approach to it was the American War, and the short and glorious struggle of Lissa; but they do not represent a real naval war. We hardly know what the result of such a war might be yet, but this is certain: whereas formerly a fleet went to sea pro visioned, &amp;c., for an unlimited period (water alone they hadto get from time to time), now, no ship can go to sea beyond a fixed number of days without obtaining a supply of coal; and the first act of an enterprising enemy would be to seize or destroy all his enemy's coaling stations, as by that means he would seriously cripple his steam fleet: ours de stroyed, we should be crippled for the time; and fancy us, with our Indian Empire, and our Chinese Possessions, our Australian Colonies, &amp;c., and no coaling stations able to hold their own against an enemy, either at Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, or Singapore. We should no longer be able to send men or material to supplement our forces in India, or elsewhere. Now, I hope that if ever such a public shame as the giving up of Gibraltar or Malta, or our other stations, is seriously pro posed in this country, the British public will rise en masse and put a stop to such high treason, as they did once before, when one of the early Georges was intriguing with Spain on the subject, in order to induce that country not to ally herself with France. Then, however, the glories of Gibraltar were fresh to the public imagination; now, the people generally know nothing of the famous history connected with it, and how it is one of the most brilliant of the military annals of this country. I would recommend any of you who take an interest in such things, to read Captain Frederick Sayer's History of Gibraltar, and Drinkwater's Siege of it. You will then be able to form a better idea of the enormous importance it is to this country, than from the few remarks I can make to you on the subject on this occasion. It is absolutely necessary for a huge Empire such as England is, with her dominions divided from her seat of Government by thousands of miles of ocean, to be connected by as many lines of communication as possible, and these lines should possess rivets here and there, by which to hold all firm together. These lines of communication must be kept open always, whether in peace or war, and to do so requires a large force, both naval and military, and a heavy annual outlay. It is not only necessary that the British uniform, as representing British sovereignty, should be seen in the various dependencies of the Crown, but when an empire is so vast and so divided as ours is, it becomes a13 matter of great importance to have a certain number of troops and ships echeloned along the whole length of the Empire, so as to be ready for any sudden emergency; thus, when the Crimean War broke out, we were able to move forward troops from Gibraltar, Malta, and Corfu to the seat of war, and later we drew on our Indian army for reinforcements. When the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, taking us with a terrible surprise, we were enabled immediately to push for ward reinforcements from the Cape, the Mauritius, Ceylon, and, fortunately, from China (where we were just sending an expedition against Canton); the opportune arrival of these small bodies of British soldiers probably saved us the Indian Empire. It spread like wildfire through India that the English were already pouring in their white troops from England, and the moral effect was incalculable. The arrival O ' of the 33rd and 95th from the Mauritius probably spared us a repetition of horrors at Bombay. Had we been obliged to wait until those troops arrived round the Cape from England, who can predict the consequences ? We were told by a Liberal War Minister, when he reduced our garrisons abroad, and denuded our Colonies of troops, that he did so because the troops thus scattered were a source of weakness to the Empire. I respectfully beg to differ from that opinion. Moreover, those garrisons formed the only reserve the English army had. A Ministry can rarely resist the temptation of reducing the army, if the troops are in this country, no matter how much such parsimony may cost the State a little later. However, it is not my purpose to enter into a discussion of our military system on this occasion; I merely refer to these stations and garrisons in order to show to you the great, nay vital, importance of them to bind this Empire together; they are the rivets to the coupling irons, lose them, and we are all in pieces: therefore, Gibraltar and Malta are absolutely necessary for us, as strategical posts and impregnable coaling stations, able to stand alone in war, if needs be. We had better have kept Corfu too; and when the big war looming in the distance does come, we shall realize the mistake of listening to Hellenic sympathies, when they are contrary to sound political and strategical reason. We next require the little14 Island of Perim, in the Eed Sea, commanding, as it does, the entrance to that highway to India; and Aden is as important and necessary to us in those seas as Gibraltar is in the Mediterranean: it is our great strategic coaling station be tween Suez and India. Ceylon is our next point, and then the Islands of Penang and Singapore, which carry us straight to our Chinese possessions of Hong Kong, There are yet two places we ought to have, and, possibly, there are many here who may live to see the day when we shall have one or both. One of these islands is Karrack,* in the Persian Gulf, and the other the famous Island of Candia in the Mediterranean, not far from Alexandria. You will, perhaps, ask why we should occupy Candia;* here are some of the reasons. In the troublous times which are coming, it is more than probable that, if we don 't occupy Candia, France, Prussia, or Russia may. Candia occupied by no one is at all events harmless, but Candia occupied by any Power except ourselves comes to be a very thorn in our side, in the same way as Malta or Gibraltar would be. Candia is a position which, in our hands, would completely command the Levant, and would be practically impregnable; and from its natural wealth, ♦ ' Karrack is. perhaps, the only spot in the Persian Gulf which is in every way suitable for permanent military occupation. Its small extent—about twelve or fourteen square miles—and rocky conformation, render it easily defensible; there are many wells of good water, which other islands, as Ormuz, do not possess, and half its surface is under cultivation. Though the thermometer ranges between 95 degrees and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, fevers are almost unknown here, and it is otherwise the most healthy island in the Persian Gulf. The great strategical importance of Karrack is discernible by a glance at the map. Com manding as it does Bushire, which is clearly visible on the one hand, and the entrance of the Shatt-ul-Arab on the other, it is the key of the Persian Gulf, if not also of Persia, Turkish Arabia, and Mesopotamia; while, in the event of the construction of the projected Euphrates Valley line by British money, its occu pation by us would be absolutely essential. ' Finally, it is ours by the same international right that Perim is ours. We only occupied Perim for the first time, between the 3rd of May and the 1st of September, 1798 ; and notwithstanding the energetic protests of Austria, France, and Turkey, we reoccupied it in 1857, being only just in time to anticipate the French Government, which had issued instructions to its naval officers to take possession. Even more essential is it that we should forthwith occupy Karrack, as there is no Aden in our possession to dominate the Gulf, and we may find Russia first in the field; for the Power that has sold the Attreck Valley may part with Karrack for a consideration.'—C. R. Low, Lieutenant, late Her Majesty's Indian Navy. February 25, 1873.15 population, and productiveness, it offers ample resources in war as well as openings for trade in time of peace. Candia is the Crete of 100 cities of Homer, it is 180 miles long, but comparatively narrow, and contains about 4,000 square miles. The population about thirty years ago was 240,000, half Greeks, half Turks; it has several fine bays and harbours. It belonged to Rome in the days of the Empire ; and in the 13th century Venice bought it, and great source of wealth it was to her; the Turks took it 1669, and Venice never recovered her loss. The foreign policy of this country .used to be that of Alexander, who, according to Arian, recognized no limits to the labours of high-spirited men, but the failure of adequate objects it should now be perfectly straightforward. Europe should be made to understand that w e keep aloot from common cases of quarrel which do not really concern the public peace of Europe or existing Treaties. That we dis like war for the sake of war, or warlike glory in the abstract, and that we prefer the glory of a lasting peace and all its civilizing concomitants of science, arts, and commerce, if we can have it; but that, though we do not wish to interfere with others, we will not be interfered with, and we will not allow our interests either in the present or future to be injured by any Power or number of Powers, whoever they may be. We should let certain great political points be perfectly well understood. I should clearly define our conduct under such circumstances, as, for instance: Any attempt on the part of France to annex or partition Belgium; Germany to annex Holland; Russia to break up and destroy the Austro- Hungarian Empire; the occupation by Russia ot Constan tinople, or any naval station in the jVIediterranean; or an invasion by that Power of any part of the lurkish dominions, Persia, or Afghanistan, should be perfectly understood would be resisted by this country with our whole power, as I am sure it would be sooner or later when John Bull awoke and realized what was going on; but, as I pointed out to you before, if we make all the world fancy we never intend to fight again about anything, you positively tempt an aggressive Power to commit the very act you hoped to prevent his doing16 when you so stoutly declared your peace-at-any-price inten tions. AVe ought not to be so ready to give advice when two nations fall out, unless we are called upon to do so. It is undignified for a nation like this to give advice she cannot insist upon being followed. It is enough to tender advice when the party advised signifies a wish to have it, and promises compliance if given. Can anything more unworthy of England be conceived than our conduct in the last Polish and the Danish affairs. We had better not bark unless we are prepared to bite. Had we taken up a strong position as regards the Danish question, it is more than probable that war and the consequent spoliation of Denmark would never have taken place. Austria would certainly not have gone on in the affair had England been firm, but as we backed out of it after having committed ourselves by very strong language, she had nothing for it but to go on to the bitter end. Then ensued the war of 1866; and of that war came the last war between France and Prussia. Now let us see where those events have landed us. Instead of the era of universal peace, when the lion and the lamb were to lie down together, promised us by the Utopian politicians of the peace-at-any- price school, what do we see ? Austria and Hungary's losses were very heavy; they are now recovering from the disasters of 1866, but she is left saddled with the heavy burden of universal military service. France, heavily weighted by an enormous debt, still bleeding at every pore from wounds inflicted not only by a foreign foe, but by her own children, knows not where to look for rest; despoiled of her ancient landmarks won after so many years of war and diplomacy, she dreams only of the day of vengeance, and we know that as soon as her army and navy are restored to anything like order, she will be true to her history and take the very first opportunity of again measuring swords with her old foe— Germany. It is well said that there is no chance of peace in Europe when France is discontented: it is bad enough when it is only 'la gloire' she thirsts after, but when she has a vulture like Alsace and Lorraine gnawing at her vitals, little chance indeed has Europe of repose. Spain is once more convulsed with internecine war—the17 natural consequence of foisting governments on the country- having no inherent and legitimate right, but mere mushroom fun&lt;n erown out of mutinous armies and navies striving to obtain power and promotion for themselves at the expense of the country. The present state of affairs was predicted to me by an able and excellent Spaniard whom I knew at Gibraltar nine years ago—he said it was inevitable. You will, I think, see no peace for Spain until she, of her own free act, decides to bring back her legitimate line of kings— viz., Don Carlos, and acknowledges the force of the principle of right and wrong, as being higher than the mere ignorant will of a section of the people, hounded into phrenzy by professional agitators. But Spain is so isolated, that what she is doing within her mountain and sea-girt boundaries matters little to the rest of the world; still it is a very sad spectacle to those who know the country, and its fine race of inhabitants, to see it torn to pieces thus by the hands of its own sons. A wholesome lesson may be deduced from what we see going on in that unhappy country. We can now realize the fearful power an army or navy, or men trained to the use of arms may come to possess, and how dangerous they may be to the liberties, prosperity, and peace of a country, if they are not animated by that true loyal devotion to the sovereign on which hinges the whole question of real discipline. We may now learn the enormous importance it is to a State for the officers of its armed forces to be men, not only of high professional attainments and efficiency, but also gentlemen in the highest and broadest sense, men animated by the highest feeling of duty, and whose sense of honour is such that no temptations of personal aggrandizement or ambition will tempt them to forget that which they owe their sovereign and the country of which he is the head. To insure this, your officers ought not to be liable to be placed or displaced, promoted or rewarded, by political parties or powers which, though in to-day, are nobodies to-morrow, and between whom and your officers no bond of loyalty and discipline can exist: soldiers as such should be kept clear of politics and politicians, and look to the sovereign—the head of the State—for all things. [292] C18 Now let us look at Prussianized and Imperial Germany. How has she fared during these troublous times ? I cannot but admire the patient endurance of a whole nation, who for so long has submitted to the terrible burden of universal liability to serve in the army for the defence of the State. A whole nation which has so soberly submitted itself to the Sergeant-Major for the national good, deserves all the success, all the glory, and all the proud position it has won for itself by its public virtue. But do not imagine that Prussia has been enabled to pass through the ordeal of the wars with Denmark, Austria, and Prance without very heavy wounds, and without imposing on herself very heavy burdens. Empire so vast, power so great, entails pro portionate responsibilities; and Prussia knows that, though France is now lying bleeding and wounded at her feet yet she is not dead, and, Phoenix like, will again rise from her ashes all the stronger for the fearful lesson she has received during the last war. It was the certainty of this coming vengeance which decided Prussia to weaken France for ever by taking Alsace and Lorraine from her. Prussia has then to be always ready—a helm on her head, with quick-match lighted; she cannot allow herself to sleep at her post. This all entails increased armaments, increased expenses, heavier taxes, and family afflictions and separations, hard for a nation to bear. 'II n'y a pas de roses sans Opines.' A great and powerful State has many duties to perform. And remember what such wars as the last cost a country like Prussia, whose army is composed of all classes—the scientific workman, the artist, the doctor, the carver, the engineer, &amp;c., one and all have to go and serve in the ranks, like the ignorant, bad, or useless. Consequently, when the death-roll is called over, the real loss to the nation is enormous, and far greater than is represented by the mere number of men killed, for she has lost part of the capitalized education and intelligence of all classes, instead of men of only a particular class, who, probably, would not be of any great value to the community out of the ranks of the army, excellent soldiers though they may be. For instance, it is difficult to realize the relative loss to two nations; one of which had an army composed like our own, the other being19 recruited like the Prussian, and both losing 40,000 men in a war. In the one, the skilled science and highly-educated classes would not be lost to the country; in the other, it would to a certain extent. The great power of Germany has, naturally, excited the jealousy of the great northern Power—Russia, hitherto her greatest ally and friend; and so long as the present Czar and the Emperor William live, it is probable that this close alliance will continue. But there are two parties in Russia—the extreme Russian party and the German or Court party. Ever since Peter the Great and the German Princesses, who for generations have married the Russian Sovereigns, have brought their German followers and friends into Russia, there has existed this jealousy, and on one occasion it nearly cost Peter his Throne. Now that Germany is assert ing herself and her unity, that she has already annexed part of Denmark's State and France's provinces to rectify her frontier and work out German unity, Russia naturally looks anxiously to her Baltic and German-speaking provinces, knowing that, if war ever does occur between them, that Germany's war-cry will be the union of all German-speaking provinces. There is no use attempting to conceal the fact that the feeling between Russia and Germany is anything but cordial, however friendly the two Courts may be; and the recent good understanding established between Austro- Hungary and Germany does not at all tend to reassure Russia on this head, who has never pardoned Austria for her joining the allies in the Crimean War, and who knows that until that Empire is crushed she will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to advance on Constantinople. All these future complications hinge on the chronic disease of Europe, ' the Eastern Question.' The policy known by that name first came into a consolidated form under Louis XIV of France, and that nation has always been the back-bone of it from that time until the other day. By a turn of the wheel of fortune, the whole policy of France as regards the Eastern Question is changed. The Eastern Question always brought France into direct opposition to Russia, except, indeed, on those occasions when the interests of France in c 220 another direction were still stronger; she then always used the Eastern Question as a lever by which to work Eussia her own way. For instance, a common saying in France a few years back was, ' Nous n'avons rien k esperer de I'alliance Anglaise' (for then Napoleon was not on the Throne, and their policy was all anti-England), ' mais pour la permission de prendre Constantinople, la Kussie nous donnera la rive gauche du Ehin !' They knew the power that their Eastern policy always gave them when they wanted Eussia to act with them. By the recent loss of territory which France has suffered at the hands of Germany, the whole Eastern Question sinks into nothing as a matter of French policy as compared with the importance of gaining a powerful ally to assist her against Germany when the moment for war arrives. It has come to this, then : France will ally herself to any Great Power who will aid her to recover her lost frontier from Germany. Which of the Powers can she benefit in any way ? and who, therefore, would be likely to court her alliance ?— Why, Eussia. All Eussia's foreign policy hinges more or less on this Eastern Question. Once separate France from it, and she has an enormous help against England—her strongest foe on the Eastern Question. The old enmity of France against England would blaze up stronger than ever, and Eussia would have the means of hitting us very hard close at home. When next the Eastern Question came on the tapis, she had France as her ally, she would probably arrange that France should occupy Belgium and Antwerp, and annex it, if the war was successful, which would give us ample occupation close at home ; while she (Eussia) would have to settle accounts with Germany and Austro-Hungary, with whom probably we should be in alliance, as also Italy and Turkey. To realize the vast importance of the Eastern Question, you have only to see the anxiety of the Governments of Europe as to how it may balance or affect them and their interests, whenever some grave complication of affairs occurs. The occupation of Constantinople by Eussia, or, in other words, the extension of the Eussian Empire and Greek Church, of which the Czar is the head, over all those countries, is the one fixed dream of all true and orthodox Eussians.21 Peter the Great was the first Czar who made himself the head of the Russian Greek Church, and ordained this policy; and Russia never loses an opportunity of gaining ground step by step in that direction. By the first Article of the Secret Treaty of Tilsit, signed by Kowrakin and Talleyrand, 7th July, 1807, ' Russia was to take possession of Turkey in Europe, and push her conquests in Asia as far as she thought proper.' She has picked quarrels with Turkey over and over again, sometimes resulting in annexation of territory,—for instance, in 1711, 1774, 1783, 1812, 1829; and in 1854, she tried and failed. Russians always deny this desire to possess Constan tinople, but facts are stronger than words. Your peace-at-any price gentlemen will tell you ' that Turkey is effete' this sick man must die.' ' Why should Christian England waste men and money on bolstering up a Mahomedan and weak Power ?' If those gentlemen would look a little further they would find an easy answer. As regards the weakness of Turkey, that is a matter of degree only ; no doubt she cannot in these days resist the attack of such a Power as Russia, and she must be defended by Christian armies and navies for the benefit of Christian Europe. Turkey has been paying much attention to her army and navy of late. We know that the old Turks were the finest troops in the world, and that when properly commanded and led now, they are first-rate troops ; quiet, obedient, and sober, living on very little, and capable of brilliant soldierly qualities, as we saw at Silistria and at Kars. The railroads of Turkey when properly developed—and a beginning has now been made—will open up the enormous wealth and resources of the country, and greatly add to its power and means of defence. As to her being a Mahomedan Power, so is England; and we should remember that our Ma homedan subjects consider the Sultan as their Pope, or head of their Church, and our alliance with him strengthens our authority much. But suppose we grant that Turkey, by comparison, is weak, all I can say is, thank God. Turkey in Europe is a position too powerful, too important, to be held by a strong and aggressive Power. Let us look back some three centuries■■■■■■■■■■MMMMMMKm'-tew. 22 and we shall see what power Turkey possessed, and mainly from the enormous political and strategical importance of her position at Constantinople, which she first took in 1453, by Mahomed II. She was the scourge of the Mediterranean, she successfully carried her flag from one end of it to the other, and the coasts of Spain and Italy were the scenes of the Mahomedan raids. She waged perpetual naval war with Venice, and may be said to have ruined the proud republic when she wrested Candia from her. She carried war into Hungary, Austria, and Poland, and twice laid siege to the town of Vienna : the first time in 1529, when it was relieved by the Emperor Charles V, at the head of his army; the second time in 1683, when it was reduced to the last straits. Some of the houses near the Palace in Vienna still have the shot embedded in their walls, which the Turks fired during the bombardment. It was relieved by John Sobiesky, King of Poland, with a small force of such European chivalry as he could hastily collect together on the spur of the moment. She held the Kingdom of Hungary beneath her rule for 144 years, for Buda Pesth, the capital, was taken by Sultan Solyman in 1541, and occupied by 12,000 janissaries. He held the entire course of the Danube from Enara to Belgrade. Thus the whole of Hungary, between the Rivers Raab and Theiss, or two-thirds of the kingdom, was a Turkish province until the seventeenth century ended, and was only reconquered by the Duke of Lorraine and the Austrians in 1686. No, we do not want a very strong or aggressive Power at Constantinople; it would too seriously threaten our line of communication with our Eastern Empire. If, therefore, Turkey is comparatively weak, all Europe, especially England, may thank God for it, for it is better for Europe and com merce that the possession of that important place should be weak enough to be controlled by Europe for the general benefit of Europe. If Turkey is an evil at all, at all events it is a passive evil; whereas, were a strong power there, it would be a very active evil. What a nice, quiet occupant of Constantinople Russia would be, were her ambitious designs carried into effect, we can best realize by seeing what her23 course of action has been during the last century and three- fourths of her history, but especially during the last century. You are, possibly, aware that the reigning House of Eomanoff claims descent from the last Emperor of the Eastern Empire, through his daughter—they therefore bear the double-headed Imperial eagle of the Roman Eastern and Western Empires; and hence, I presume, consider that they have an hereditary right to Constantinople. The remarkable man, Peter the Great, was the first sove reign who brought Russia into prominence: he it was who commenced the work of civilization, and traced out the future great career for his country. When he ascended the throne, Russia consisted of— Russia, European .. .. 79,345 geo. sq. miles. „ Asiatic .. .. .. 185,781 „ „ 265,126 „ „ It now consists of 389,311-44, so that from the commencement of Peter's reign in 1689, the Empire has been added to to the extent of 124,185 geographical square miles,* which represents territory equal to more than the whole of Great Britain and Ireland, which is only 121,115 square miles. The approxi mate population in 1872 was calculated to be 82,172,022, From 1722 to 1858, i.e., in 136 years, the people increased from fourteen to seventy-four millions. Of course, conquest had much to do with this large increase, but not by any means as much as would appear at first sight. The history of Russia, from Peter's day till now, has been one long series of conquests and annexations—for the details of which, I refer you to this list, which I have obtained from a most reliable source. ( Vide Appendix.) I found a curious notice of Peter in the Memoirs of the Due de St. Simon, written at the time of his visit to Holland, and subsequently when he visited Paris; and as anything showing the man, illustrates the country he made, 1 have made the following extracts for you:— * Vide Statistical Society of London Journal, September 18/2.24 Extract from the Memoirs of the Due de St. Simon, describing Peter the Great. ' The Czar had already begun his voyages; he has made so much noise in the world, and justly so, that I will enter in some detail of a Prince so great and well known, and who will doubtless remain so to all time, for he has made a Court where was never one before, and a nation hitherto despised and entirely ignored, from its state of uncivilized barbarism, to be feared and respected by all Europe, and, as a matter of necessity, enabled it to take part for the future in the affairs of all this part of the world. ' This Prince was in Holland in order to personally learn the art of ship-building, although incog, following his object, and, not wishing to be put to inconvenience by his great position or person, he took care to have all respect and atten tion shown him, but in his own manner and fashion. ' He was much offended with England because she had not hurried herself to send him an Embassy when so near to her shores, the more so, as, without committing himself, he was very anxious to enter into commercial relations with her. At last England sent an Embassy. He delayed giving audience, but finally the day and hour were named. The scene of reception was on board a great clumsy Dutch ship which he was going to examine. The Ambassadors thought the place very barbarous for such an audience, but they had to put up with it, and it was much worse when they got on board, for the Emperor sent to say he was aloft, and that he would receive them there ; those Ambassadors who were not sufficiently good sailors to climb the rigging excused themselves from going aloft; the C^ar, however, insisted: the Ambassadors were sore troubled at so strange a propo sition insisted upon with such pertinacity. At last, after some very sharp answers to their messages, they saw they would be obliged to go,, and they accordingly mounted the rigging. Up in this small and elevated position in the clouds the Czar received them with the same majesty as though seated on his throne, heard their speeches, replied courteously for their Sovereign ; he then laughed at them for25 their fear to mount aloft, and made them understand he had paid them off for paying their respects to him so late. 'King William III on his part had already realized the great qualities of this Prince, and did all he could to stand well with him. Finally, matters were so managed that Peter visited England, still incog. He was received as a monarch we wished to stand well with; and, after a good look round, Peter returned to Holland. ' The Czar wished to visit Venice, and Rome, and Italy, and, above all, to see Louis XIV and France. The King was sounded on the subject: the Czar was much mortified, how ever, at having his offered visit honestly declined by the King, who would not be embarrassed by it. The Emperor of Germany, however, received him. He was suddenly recalled to Russia by a conspiracy, at the head of which was his sister, of whom he was fond, but had never allowed to marry. The discontent arose because Peter had cut his beard and his long national costume, and had discontinued many barbarous cus toms, and because he put foreigners in many of the first posts of confidence. He pardoned but imprisoned his sister, and hung the principal ringleaders at the bars of his windows, as many as he could per diem. ' In 1711 Peter attacked Turkey, because they had given protection to the unfortunate Charles XII of Sweden. The battle took place among the swamps of the Pruth; Peter was totally defeated. By the advice of his wife (who had been the wife of one of his drummers, but whom he had taken from her husband and publicly married, having in the mean time divorced his own and shut her up in a convent), he demanded a secret interview with the Grand Vizier, who had defeated him, and from whose power it would have been impossible to escape with the broken remnant of his army. He played his little game so well, and bribed the Vizier so roundly, that he signed a Treaty with the Czar, letting him retire from his present position with all his people, the Turks consenting to feed them, as they were starving. The Czar consented to restore Azof when he had arrived at home; to destroy all the forts and to burn all the vessels on the Black Sea; and to allow Charles XII to return to Sweden byiilM—1 I 1 • ■ 20 Pomerania; further, he stipulated to pay to the Turks all the expenses of the war. When this Treaty was known in the Turkish camp there was the greatest opposition to it, and it was strongly urged that the Czar should be conveyed to Constantinople a prisoner; but, as by this proceeding the Sultan would have obtained the rich bribes of the Czar which the Grand Vizier preferred having for himself, the latter put his agreement with Peter into force: he was strangled, how ever, on arriving at Constantinople. Peter never forgot this service oi his wife, whose pluck and presence of mind had doubtless saved him and his army. He had her crowned Empress, and she took part in all his acts and councils afterwards. ' As to his part of the Treaty, he was a long time without giving up Azof, and destroying his forts on the Black Sea; as for his vessels, he retained them nearly all; and would not allow Charles XII to return to Sweden as agreed on. He it was who, at the advice of William III, made himself the head ot the Greek Church in Russia. He had wished to become Roman Catholic in order to enable him to intermarry the House of liussia with the members of the European reigning Houses, and for that purpose had sent an Envoy to Rome to see how the land lay; but William III dissuaded him, and advised him to do what Henry VIII had done, saying ' he would never be quiet at home till he was his own Pope.' Peter the Great was received in Paris in 1717, under the Regency.' In our day, we know that this desire to possess Constan tinople culminated in the Crimean War, and how France, England, Piedmont, and Turkey with, subsequently, Austria, after two years of a terrible contest, succeeded in defeating the Russians and destroying their strongholds in the Crimea; and how, by the Treaty of Paris in 1856, Sevastopol was no more to be made a fortress, and the Black Sea was to be neutralized for the general peace and benefit of commerce and Europe. Though defeated, Russia had grounds for satisfaction on the whole. She might indeed well be proud of the conduct of27 her soldiers and sailors who defended the strongly fortified position of Sevastopol,—for fortress, in the proper sense of the word, it was not. Nothing could exceed the devoted- ness of her officers; their energy, skill, and personal courage were always the admiration of all of us who witnessed it; as day by day and night by night the weary hours of the siege rolled on, as though they would never come to an end. Nearly twice ten years have passed away since those days; but the name of that gallant engineer, the life and soul of the defence of Sevastopol, must still be in the memory of us all. I mean Todleben. I am proud to say I have made his acquaintance since the war, and I found him as courteous and charming a gentleman, as I know him to be a gallant and first-rate soldier. The bravery, devotedness, and endurance of the private soldiers was quite as conspicuous as the qualities of their officers; and when men undertake to cry down the Russian army, I feel sure they have never had the honour of fighting them. All I can say is, God grant in my day England may not again have to struggle in mortal fight with so redoubtable a foe. I respect them as enemies, and as friends I know none I like better, few as well. I cannot afford to pass by without attention the acts of Russia towards Constantinople; I cannot so insult her as to take no notice of what she is about. Her power is so great; her ambition, proved by the acts of two centuries, so vast, her energy, perseverance, and skill so admirable, her main object and desire, viz., obtaining European Turkey, so natural, that I should be wilfully blind if I did not see what all is tending to, and if I did not watch every movement of the Muscovite with grave attention. The following extract from Colonel Mitchell's Power and Position of Russia, published in 1838, will show some of the consequences which may be apprehended:— ' When the Muscovites shall be in actual possession of Constantinople, they will be able, by means of the rivers that descend from the heart of their dominions into the Black Sea, to collect all their forces, in perfect security, along the shores of the Dardanelles, in order to hurl them, whenever it may28 suit their convenience, against the southern countries of Europe. ' The western provinces of Turkey will of course follow the fate of the capital. The same will be the case with the islands of the Archipelago; for we shall, of course, be too much occupied with our party feuds,—with striving for places and commissionerships, to attend much to the interest of the nation. Established along the shores of the Adriatic, Eussia will soon be required to settle the affairs of Italy, as she settled the affairs of Poland. With Asia Minor under her guns, she must, of course, become the arbitress of all the little Mahomedan States into which that country will split on the fall of Constantinople. Kussian commercial ukases will therefore be law from Alexandria to Cattaro in the Adriatic. Mistress of the Black Sea, in possession of all the splendid naval stations of the Levant, she cannot fail to become a maritime Power of first-rate magnitude ; for Greece, under whatever Sovereign it may be placed, will be about as independent of Russia, as the Kingdom of the Isle of Man would be independent of Great Britain. ' These dangers, we shall be told, are too distant to be speculated upon: and it is very certain that they may never come to pass. We do not know what fate has in store for either Christian or Mahomedan nations; but a great people should depend on their strength and resources and not upon chance. The events which are now visibly in progress, naturally bring the dangers here specified in their train ; the barrier which arrested the march of Russia towards the south can no longer resist the mighty pressure, and it is easy to foretell the direction which the torrent will take, when all the safe-guards of the land have yielded to its fury. This is laying no stress on the skill and ability supposed to have been displayed by Russian diplomacy ; and though it would be the height of injustice to accuse a Government of a succession of treacherous intrigues, calculated only to advance projects of national aggrandizement, it must be allowed that many of the revolutions which have occasionally distmbed the world during the last hundred years, were singularly well timed for the advancement of Russian power.29 The troubles and divisions in Poland that first led to friendly- intervention, and then to the subjugation of the country; the mutiny in the Swedish army under Gustavus III, which saved Petersburgh, and the poisonous remnants of which led ultimately to the murder of that high-minded monarch; the claim of independence, set up by the Tartars, and supported by Russia against the Turks, which led to the subsequent conquest of the Crimea; the Servian insurrection under Zerny-George ; the revolution in Sweden, that placed a foreigner, dependent on the good-will of Eussia, on the throne of the Vasas, and almost reduced the Scandinavian peninsula to a Russian province; the Greek revolution, that served as a pretext for the war of 1828, and completely broke the power of Turkey; and lastly, the insurrection of Mahomet Ali of Egypt, that occasioned the friendly occupa tion of the Dardanelles, and the Treaty which has placed the navigation of those straits entirely at the mercy of Russia, were all, to say the least, singular instances of good fortune. Let us now examine, therefore, what appear the best means of securing our country against the progress of a nation which, in its unexampled career of aggression, is so strongly favoured by the power of chance, or the skill of its agents.' The end of the Crimean conflict, by not permitting Russia to have a war fleet on the waters of the Black Sea, enabled her to be economical for some years, and, as no man can help doing a thing which he is obliged to do, the position was accepted. But it must not be supposed that Russia, who had made so brilliant a fight single-handed against two of the greatest Powers of Europe during upwards of two years, and whose defeat was, if possible, even more honour able than the success of the foe, would submit to beinsf ex- eluded for one day longer than she was obliged, from the waters of a sea half the coast of which belonged to herself. Russians, in society and elsewhere, openly stated the feeling of the country when they said that nothing would induce them to accept their position in the Black Sea one day longer than they were obliged, and warned all that they would take the first opportunity to tear up the Treaty of Paris and30 reassert their position in those waters. We had, therefore, due notice of this intention on their part. We now remember what followed. By the war of 1866, Austria was laid low ; but Russia realized that her army, which had not then been armed even with rifles, was in no state to undertake war. She bided her time, and pushed forward by all the means in her power the rail communications of the Empire. She com menced re-arming her army with breechloaders; and the modernizing of her principal first-class fortresses, which had been going on for some time under the direction of Todleben, was urged forward still more rapidly. Four years had hardly passed before Europe was again convulsed by the war of 1870. Then, with France down ; Prussia weakened by three bloody wars; Austria in an undeveloped state of military transition, still weak from her heavy losses of 1866; Italy on the verge of revolution; Spain drifting once more into civil war; Turkey feeble; and England at loggerheads with America about the Alabama question, Eussia saw she had a glorious opportunity of carrying out her long-cherished design. It is true Russia was in no state to go to war; still the other Powers who might have gone to war with her on this question were as little, or even less prepared, and others were fully occupied already. The possibility of regaining by diplomacy all she had lost in the Crimean War was too great a temptation, and the famous Circular of Prince Gortchakoff, of October, 1870, was fired off. We must all remember the excitement that that document produced in this country and on the Continent. John Bull was furious; and was only quiet when he was led to believe that the Government would not recognize Russia's right to repudiate the Treaties of 185G. It is not true, as has been stated in certain quarters, that the Government of the day was pushed into the line of action it pursued by the vociferous cries of the public of this country; the public, on the contrary, protested against such an open and insulting breach of international honour as was threatened by Russia. However, the Premier, who, we know, has a virtuous horror of war, and the peace-at-any price party yelping at his heels, carried the day, and the31 straightforward despatch sent from our Foreign Office, in reply to the arrogant notice of repudiation sent from St, Peters- burgh, had its manhood ripped untimely from it; for the despatch, otherwise so sound and strong, had a paragraph at the end which gave Eussia to understand that, had she asked for a Conference to consider her case, the points repudiated would have been conceded. Truly, the hand which drew the despatch showed all the skill and boldness of a master, the last paragraph was a feeble addition, easily discerned to be the work of another and weaker hand. In plain English it said, ' But if Russia is a good boy, and asks pretty for his sugar-plums, he shall have them.' Bismarck was then asked to get a Conference, where the matter was to be amicably discussed, the result of which, of course, would be that Russia would have what she had defied us all to get. It was simply a game of brag. The Russians knew with whom they had to deal. It was, at all events, worth the venture. They tossed up for it, and won; they deserved the prize they gained, they showed such pluck and skill in doing it. Thus the results of a long and bloody war, which had cost millions of money and thousands of lives, and plunged half Europe into mourning, were wiped out by a stroke of the pen ; and Russia, without moving a soldier, spending a penny, or firing a shot, found herself replaced in the same position she was in before the Crimean War, plus the well-deserved prestige of her success. She had formed again her first parallel of approach against Turkey in Europe, and turned the flank of her foes who would resist her advance when the day of action came ; for so long as the Black Sea remained neutral, and Russia was not per mitted to have a war fleet on it, she would be constrained to advance on Constantinople by land through the Principalities; and so long as the Austro-Hungarian Empire remains intact, she blocks Russia's advance on Turkey by that route. For merly, when the Emperor Joseph and Catherine the Great were friends and allies, and acted together, this was of no consequence; but the policy of those days has changed for ever, and since Austria threw in with us in the Crimean War, Russia has hated her with all the intensity a nation is capable32 of, who considers she has been ungratefully treated hy an old friend, whom she saved in 1848. Now Russia is at liberty to rebuild her fleet, and will refortify Sevastopol till it is quite impregnable. Kertch has been strengthened and improved long since, and is said to be stronger now than Sevastopol was in the old war. Paissia, probably, took the high-handed course she did, thinking by that means to hide her real inability to fight at that moment from Europe's eyes, and justly thinking that Europe would shrink from another appeal to arms so soon, while she was still streaming with blood at every pore. She probably counted on getting a Conference, where the grievance would be sure to be redressed, even if she failed to carry her point by terrorism, and by the deliberate act of repudiation of a solemn Treaty without excuse: she was right. By defiantly claiming all she wanted, as her right, she insured getting it conceded, if she only changed her modus operandi. In the Imperial announcement to the people of Russia of the results of the Conference which ensued, no mention is made of the Protocol which was read before, and adhered to, by all the Plenipotentiaries, viz., that 'No Power has the right to retire from the execution of a Treaty, or to modify its stipulations, without the consent of the other Powers who signed it in a friendly way.' And in the ' St. Petersburgh Gazette,' of the 2nd April, 1871, it is distinctly stated ' that Russia lias not withdrawn her declaration.' So we stood before Europe as having had our nose pulled. Not only was it declared to the Russian people that the Government had not withdrawn the Circular so offensive to Europe and humiliating to this country, but the Czar pro ceeded to reward Prince Gortchakoff by making him a High ness, for the great success which had crowned his diplomacy, and also for the manner in which he had carried the Imperial wishes into effect! These are the words of the ukase:— ' En recompense des glorieux services rendus an Trone et a la patrie par le Chancelier des Affaires Etrang^res, Prince Gortchakoff, et en consideration du mode d'action entibrement con forme d nos volonUs qui a fait aujourd'hui aboutir la question de la Mer Noire k une solution pacifique et d'accord33 avec la dignity de la Eussie, nous attachons tres gracieusemeut le titre d'Altesse a la dignity principle port^e par lui et sa descendance.' This is a proof, a public recognition by the Czar, that the Circular of 19th October, 1870, was in accordance with his wishes, and that that has produced the desired result. Baron Brunnow also was rewarded for his share in the Diplomatic triumph, and w T as created a Count of the Empire. And truly it must be admitted that the Czar was perfectly right, and that every liussian who assisted in the work of tearing up the Treaty of Paris, as touching the position of Eussia in the Black Sea, has done good service to his country, and deserves reward and public recognition from his Sovereign. We . may therefore now consider Europe, as regards Russia, in the same position as though the Crimean War had not been fought, but Russia all the stronger for the great experience and knowledge she gained in that conflict, and generally incomparably stronger than she was then. There were only two lines of railway in Russia in 1854— one commenced in 1838 to Tsarskoe Selo, 25 versts I oug :, and the Nicholas rail from the capital to Moscow. There were last year 7,500 miles of rail made or under construction, connecting all parts of European Russia, and connecting it with Asia; and every day fresh loans are made, and fresh concessions granted to private companies to extend this rail way system to all parts of the Empire. Russia's motto is, ' I bide my timeand having suc ceeded in destroying the noxious net of the Treaty of 1856, which confined her limbs and prevented their healthy growth, her great object now for the next few years is undoubtedly peace. She foresees, and lias for several years past, that the recent successes and consequent unity of Germany may in the future bring on hostilities between that Empire and Russia, and that that Power—now the first military Power in the world—will probably decidedly object to the mouths of the Danube and the position of Constantinople being taken possession of by Russia. The interests of Austro-Hungary are the same as those of the German Empire, and in the able work written by General Fadejeff two or three years since, [292] d34 when discussing the military power of Russia, he speaks of the future in this way:—' Russia as a single Power is more than a match for any other one Power, but it is not at all probable that she will ever find herself at war with any one Power. Which is the most likely combination of Powers, then, she is likely to have to encounter ?' And he decides : Germany and Austria combined; and then proceeds to discuss how Russia should prepare herself to meet such a contingency. Formerly, no doubt, when Hungary was dis contented, her game would have been to revolutionize that country. Now Hungary is the most loyal part of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, for the old Magyar race—the ruling race for 1,000 years in Hungary—is but a small minority in the aggregate of States composing the Hungarian Kingdom, and do not represent more than one-eighth of the whole popula tion, most of the other races being of some Sclave nationality, except a certain proportion of Germans and Jews. The Magyars know well that, if the Empire of Austria were broken up, they at all events as a race would be absorbed off the face of the earth, the German portions of the Empire would naturally gravitate to Germany, the Italians to the Italians, the Sclaves of Hungary would be persuaded that Russia was their natural country and would be content to throw in for the Pan Sclave theory, hoping one day to become the ruling Power of the southern Sclave Empire. But the Magyar—a race which came from no one knows where, unless from the regions of Central Asia, which race their type resembles—would gradually disappear as a dominant race, for it is a people which may be said to be fading out, as marriages and births will prove. Russia at Constantinople, or holding the Lower Danube— the natural outlet east for the commerce of central Europe— would as a consequence break up the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It may therefore be taken for granted that Austro- Hungary will always resist the encroachments of Russia in the direction of Turkey. It should be noted consequently that the interests of those countries and of England are the same! Should Germany, from unforeseen circumstances, deter-mine to ally herself with Russia, then we should find that the probable grouping of nations in the future struggle would be Eussia and Germany against England, France, Italy, Austria, and Turkey. But if, as is more probable, Germany and Austria unite for common action, France is likely to forsake the Eastern Question, and probably, tempted by Russia, with her approval to annex Belgium, and, in hopes of revenging herself on Prussia and regaining her lost provinces, she would consent to Russia's doing what she pleased as regards Euro pean Turkey. The group would then be France and Russia against the rest of Europe; and if they ever do try that, I think the result would be fatal to both. Having sketched the general aspect of politics on the European Continent, I now propose to call your attention to a question of great interest which is actually in progress of gestation, and which, sooner or later, may come to have very great importance for this country, both as regards her Indian Empire, and her influence and position as one of the great Powers of Europe. I refer to the question of Central Asia, and the steady advance of Russia in that portion of the globe. I have gone through the existing state of European politics in order that you might more readily understand the influence that this Asiatic question may have on them a few years hence. The advance of Russia in Central Asia dates from the reign of Peter the Great; and while Alexander arranged with Napoleon at Tilsit, that Russia was to annex what she pleased in Central Asia, the Czar Nicholas used to say, ' Russia has no boundary in Central Asia,' and Yakoob Beg, of Kashgar, said the other day, ' It is not in the Russian to live at peace with his neighbour. He may do so for a year or two, but that is the utmost; after that he is sure to make war, and conquer as much as he can.' These consecutive acts and theories are useful to look back to, as they help us to form an opinion as to the probable course events will take in the future, and enable us to estimate at their true value the often repeated assurance of Russia that she had no intention of increasing her territory, that already she had too much, and that to add to it would be but to increase her difficulties and D 236 her weakness. While we may give her all possible credit for speaking what she intended at the time, still it cannot be denied that she has been forced to act in a very different manner. I believe it is more or less the mission of Russia to advance east and absorb the Tartar tribes of Asia; and so long as she keeps within bounds, and her acts do not really inter fere with our vital interests, I am not one of those who would urge constant irritating prying and interference with what they may consider necessary for their own authority, or the preservation of the interests and lives of Russian subjects in those wild regions. Besides this, as we cannot by interference there prevent what they are doing, it is more dignified and wiser for a great nation like England, however much she may disapprove of what she sees going on, to preserve a solemn silence; and I strongly object to any line of policy which might seem to endorse or countenance any advance of Russia or aggression of Russia among the fanatical Mahomedan tribes of those regions. Russian advance in Central Asia is nothing new, it has been long going on ; but to use the argument so often heard when questions of this sort arise to disturb the digestions of people in Westminster, ' Oh, it is so far off; it can't come in our time: why should we bother ourselves about it?' .&amp;c. Central Asia was not only far off, but few people knew, or cared to know, much about it; and when we see how a dis cussion on our Indian Empire will clear the benches of the House of Commons, I suppose we must not be surprised if there is apathy shown about doings in a country which they cannot see concerns us—at all events now, and the very existence of which they were almost ignorant of. The Russians knew this, and made little noise about their advance in those countries, their constant assertion being that they had already far too much territory—it was a source of weak ness to them—and that their orders to their generals, &amp;c., in Central Asia were, on no account to increase their territory. But one thing is certain: if a nation commits itself to an advance in a country like Asia, be it Turkestan or India, you can no more say, ' So far will I go, and no further,' than tiy. You cannot stop until you have a really well-defined military37 frontier. So that, notwithstanding all we were told about their desire to arrest their progress, all who understood the question knew that their advance would go on until such a time as a properly-defined military frontier was reached; and that military frontier reached, and Eussian power firmly consolidated behind it, with her communications with the centre of her power in Europe completed, they knew that Russia came to be very powerful for good or evil to English supremacy in India. And further, that when these railways and communications were finished, Russia would be far more completely united for military purposes within her Eastern Empire on the Oxus and Syr Daria, than England with her Empire on the Indus; for whereas Russia's communication would run the whole way through her own territory free from any possible attack from a foreign foe, ours would run by sea, and through foreign lands, until we reached India. So that when Russian power is consolidated in Central Asia, and her military frontier is completed to the Oxus, she comes to possess a very valuable strategical position, which she could use with the greatest advantage against England when the day of the Eastern Question anives; and I will explain to you how, in as few words as I can. We have an enormous Indian Empire, which was won by the sword, and, however much philanthropists may tiy to persuade you to the contrary, we must for many years to come realize that by the strong-armed hand we can alone hope to keep it. The Asiatic mind only respects that Power which it fears, and which it knows can enforce its laws, if needs be: so long as we can convince our Indian fellow- subjects of our power to hold India against either foes from without or rebels from within, so long will the great Empire of India flourish. Let that physical power be realized by all under our rule, and we may civilize, educate, govern, &amp;c., as much as we please ; but relax it, and good bye to our rule in that important region of the world. I am not one of those who anticipate a Russian attack of India at present, she has enough to do now in Turkestan; but though she may not attack India, there is nothing to prevent her in a few years advancing on Balkh or Herat, either vid Karshi and the Oxus, or from the38 Caspian, by the Meshed line, or the Attrek valley and Merve route. If there, the political importance of the position would soon make itself felt in India, and her intrigue, &amp;c., could easily foment disturbances within our own border; this would oblige us to dispatch a strong reinforcement of our European troops to India exactly at that time when we might want the whole of them here in Europe, either to defend these shores against France (who might be the ally of Russia at that time), or to resist Franco-Russian aggression in Belgium, or at any other point in Europe where our military presence might be required. Russia's military power is so great, that she is enabled to keep on foot two large armies — one on a war footing would represent about 1,000,000 of men, which could be used exclusively for European purposes; and she would still have her Asiatic army, which on a war footing amounts to a matter of 250,000 men more. These are exclusive of irregulars. Thus the power of Russia in Asia would greatly assist her European projects by enabling her to distract our attention and power to our Indian Empire at the very moment we want to con centrate it here. This is really the tender point for us in the continued advance of Russia in Central Asia, and is far more to be feared in its results than an actual attack of our Indian frontier, and is what we should especially watch and guard against. We have recently laid down an imaginary frontier to the northern boundary of Afghanistan, and given the Russians to understand that south of that belongs to our ally, and under our protection ; but I venture to think that allowing our selves to be drawn into any such arrangement, agreement, or definition, was a capital blunder. It was quite sufficient for it to have been understood that we insisted on the frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan being inviolable; we need have gone no further into the matter, or attempted to lay down a line in a country at present unsurveyed and unknown. One would have thought the San Juan Boundary Question, which has so lately deprived us of a valuable position opposite Vancouver's Island, ought to have been warning enough against making Treaties and drawing frontiers, the ground of39 which we are absolutely ignorant of; and at the very time that our attention was attracted to the sources of the Oxus, and to the discussion of whether Wakhan and Badakshan belonged to Afghanistan or Bokhara, the Russians were o O steadily advancing from another direction, viz., from the Caspian towards Merve. However, it is idle crying over spilt milk. We have done it, and we must now set to work to face the difficulties of the position like Britons. The great strength to Russia in future wars, as compared to former contests, will be her network of railways, and the facility she will possess of concentrating all the means of her vast empire on a distant theatre of war. It is our first duty to look to this. We cannot have too many strings to our bow, or too many lines of communication with our Indian Empire. There is one line which still remains lor our energy to complete, and the sooner we set about it the better. I mean the Euphrates Railway. There is no time to be lost. Russia may not be formidable now, but it is im possible to say what may be done in the next six or seven years. Chemkent, on the Syr Daria, was her most advanced post in 1864, and Prince Gortchakoff's Circular of 1864 told us all that the limit of Russian advance had been reached ; at the commencement of 1865, her frontier post on the Syr Daria was not yet at Taschkent. But, in 1866, she had already taken Khojhend and Khokan, and by 1868 had advanced to Samarcand and Bokhara. In 1869 she occupied Krasnovodsk, on the east coast of the Caspian, and built a fort there. In 1870 she advanced 103 miles south to Tash- Arvat Kala, and later in the same year pushed on to Kizil Arvat, a Turcoman fort. The extreme point east of the Caspian to which they have advanced, is about 133 miles. The next probable point is a Turcoman fort called Karys, 33 miles further, and forming part of a chain of forts which extends to Sarakhs, 65 miles from Merve, and 133 from Herat. Nominally, some of these khanates are only tributary to her. We know what that means. She is not yet quite prepared to take the trouble to rule them, and allows the native rulers still to wield the semblance of power ; but now shortly the one remaining link in their40 military frontier will be completed, and Khiva will be incor porated within Enssian Turkestan. Of course, as usual, they say it will not, and that they are only going to release their prisoners. But we know what Russian advances and Treaties of commerce and friendship always entail, and the actual possession of Khiva is a mere matter of time. The Aral Sea will be connected by rail with the Caspian as soon as it can be made, and then, probably, Krasnovodsk will be joined with Khiva. A large army, tjomplete in every respect, is always at hand in the Caucasus; the railway, already completed from Poti to Tiflis, is about to be extended to Baku; and thus Russia will be able to concentrate troops, vid the Black Sea, Tiflis, Poti, Baku, and all down the line of the Volga to the Caspian, with steam communication the whole way. There are three parallel lines of rail which branch off from the Moscow-Voronej main line, and which connect the centre of Russia with the Volga, and so with the East. To meet this, we should aid the Turkish Government by every means in our power to complete the Euphrates Valley Railway. I will not enter now into all the different views regarding the advantages of the various routes proposed for this line. I will content myself by saying what in my humble opinion would best answer our purpose, and what would be best for the immediate benefit of Turkey. The saving between the routes from London to Bombay, by Suez and by the Euphrates, has been calculated at from 723 miles to 1,000 miles, and the saving of time ninety-two hours ; and as Kurrachee in the Persian Gidf, the port of the Indus, would be the point of debarkation for our troops in case of war threatening our north-western frontier, and not Bombay, the saving of time would be much greater still, besides the gain of avoiding the monsoon. The route which, in my opinion, would be the best for us to obtain would be that starting from the mouths of the Orontes, or Alexandretta (Scandaroon), by Aleppo, to the Euphrates at Jaber Castle, and by the right of the river to Bussorah, or Grain (Koweyt), on the Persian Gulf. Its cost is estimated at 9,000,000^. It is the shortest line, being hardly41 900 miles, and therefore the most valuable to us as a means of conveyance of troops, &amp;c., to India ; but the exact line best to follow can only be properly decided by sending a competent Committee to the spot. The general outline is all I attempt now to urge. There is a party who want the line to be made from Scutari on the Black Sea, but this would be a distance of 1,500 miles, and would have this serious disadvantage for us, viz., that if the terminus were at Scutari, or at some point along the coast ot the Black Sea, we should (in the event of war between Turkey, England, and Russia), have our railway and means of communication with India at the mercy of the enemy; and even supposing the terminus at Scutari could be protected from the Russian navy, still a land operation might enable the Russian to cut our line of communication between Scutari and Bussorah; whereas, were the line run from the Orontes or Alexandretta along the south bank of the Euphrates, the whole width of Asia Minor would be interposed between our line of communication and the enemy. Not only ought we to urge the completion of the Euphrates Railway by every means in our power, but we ought to do all we can to complete our Indian railways, so as to connect our advanced north-western frontier with the country in rear. A\ e ought to come to an arrangement with our ally the Khan of Khelat, and occupy the position of Quettah to the north of the Bolan Pass, eight marches from Quettah, and connect Dadur on the south of it with the railway system of Sukkur, on the Indus. If Russia should attempt any advance on Balkh or Herat, we should immediately occupy Candahar with a military force, and thus command the routes vid Cabul and Ghuznee. And now that we have formed an alliance with Shere Ali of Afghanistan, and hold ourselves morally responsible lor his good behaviour, we should insist on having a Commissioner stationed at Herat, and an agent at Balkh; and it he would consent, a military station at Candahar, which is equidistant from Herat, or Balkh. The reasons we should insist on this are obvious. e will presume that complications have arisen in Europe, that# 42 Russia sees an opportunity to advance on Turkey in Europe (this, of course, is not probable for some few years to come; but, as I said before, in a few years it is impossible to say what may happen), her position in Central Asia being con solidated, her railway and steam communication being com plete by the Volga, by the Black Sea to Baku and Asterabad, her railways from Krasnovodsk Bay along the course of the Oxus to the Aral mouth, and the rail across the Ust Urt wilderness from the north of the Caspian to the Aral; or were she in occupation of Merve, a strong reserve of the Asiatic army of 150,000 to 200,000 men, massed in the Caucasus, she wishes to distract England from Europe, and to oblige her to send a strong military reinforcement to India. What can she do under these circumstances ? She can easily advance suffi cient force from Samarcand and Bokhara via Karshi, 85 miles, to Kerki on the Oxus, 65 miles, thence 175 miles to Balkh. From Balkh to Herat the whole distance would only be 370 miles; the road is good, all but four marches. If we still keep our line on the Indus, without any advanced posts at Quettah or Candahar, we should, under such circum stances, find we had 770 miles to march to defend Herat, if we wished to prevent Russia taking it; while Russia, sup posing she had established herself at Balkh, would only have 370 miles to march, and as the Russians are permitted practically by us, to do anything they please north of the Oxus, they would be quite at home at Kerki, on that river, and if there, they would only be 160 miles from Balkh, while Peshawur, our nearest point, is 547 miles from Balkh; so that, supposing we wished to prevent the occupation of Balkh by Russia, we should have more than three times as far to march, whereas, had we an advanced station at Candahar, we could be at Herat before they could reach it from Balkh, or we could move on Balkh. If we held Quettali as an advanced post, and Dadur on the south of the Bolan was connected with our base on the Indus by rail, with a military post at Candahar, we need not be afraid of any Russian games of this sort. Russia's invasion is, therefore, neither so difficult ot performance in a short time as appears to be to the minds of many men. She need go no further than occupy Balkh43 and Herat; and if Balkh and Herat were taken in the autumn, it would be six months before we could move against them from the Indus, and in six months they would have ample time to consolidate themselves in the country. The main advance could be made, or reinforcements be sent, by the Asterabad and Meshed Herat routes, or the Attrek Valley and Merve route, more easily than from the north. It seems to me that it must be well worth the while of the English Govern ment to guarantee 2 per cent, of the Turkish guarantee for the formation of a railway to India, which would so much strengthen our position in India; where the Government has already guaranteed 2,000,000/. per annum on railway capital alone; it seems to me merely a sort of insurance. Surely, it must be worth the while of an-Empire such as this to render a portion of it as secure as possible, when the exports and imports of that portion alone have risen in thirty years from 24,000,000/. to nearly 100,000,000/. Total value of all imports in 1871 was nearly 39,000,000/.; total value of exports in 18/1 was nigh 58,000,000/. Surely a country into the ports of which 13,843 vessels entered, freighted with 2,981,854 tons in one year (1871) is worth securing by every means in our power— is worth giving a 2 per cent, guarantee on less than 10,000,000/. for a country whose revenue amounted to 51,500,000/., and whose expenditure amounted in 1870 to 50,000,000/.—can surely give a paltry guarantee which she may not even be ever called upon to pay. While we are haggling over a misery of this kind, we are lending millions to Russia to make her railways, which will enable her to sorely puzzle us when the time for action arrives. Besides this, you help your ally, Turkey, to strengthen herself on her eastern frontier against Russia, and we should enable ourselves to assist Persia, if, in the future, Russia should contemplate still further encroachments on her territory. You may not have heard that Mr. Renter has just had the grant of all the rail ways and telegraphs in that country, and that engineers have been sent out to survey the line, &amp;c. The line is proposed to be in communication with the Russian Poti-Tiflis line, and will go from Resht to Teheran, and thence south to Bunder Abass, which brings steam communication near the Belochistanfrontier, and offers another line of advance for Kussia, and renders our completion of the Euphrates line all the more a necessity. We should, besides, never forget that that portion of our Indian subjects from which we have most to apprehend in the way of rebellion, &amp;c., is the Mahomedan portion. Now, as I mentioned before, the Sultan is looked upon as the Mahomedan Pope, and, supposing we were in close alliance with Turkey and the Sultan, and at war with Russia, and we were to land a regiment or two of the Sultan's army as our allies in India, we need fear no rebellion from our Maho medan subjects, and nothing would so much tend to disarm Russian intrigue among these men as the fact of our being known to be in close friendship and alliance with the Sultan. You should then all set to work and inform yourselves more about our enormous Empire, on which the sun never sets. 1 ou must realize the enormous importance of our Indian Empire and our Chinese commerce, for the industries, the manufactures, and the wealth of this country ; and remember that we must and ought to have an army and a navy for the protection of such enormous power, and such enormous wealth, as may be ample to insure its defence against all and any contingencies. The constantly increasing wealth and prosperity of this country enables it to increase its means of defence and pro tection, and it ought to do so. Why, it is but an insurance after all. The British people have been humbugged long enough about foreign politics, and it is chiefly their own fault. The upper classes, as a rule, know as little as those below them on these subjects, and hence the fatal mistakes which are made, and the mortal apathy which exists about all questions be yond parish or local affairs. You intelligent, hard-headed fellows, who live in towns, and whose brains—hit against each other—emit as brilliant sparks as your own hammers at Low Moor, turn your attention to these things. Believe me, they are as important to the welfare of England, and all of us, as anything else. Let no more wars, which have cost England some of her bravest, her dearest, and her best, which has sent 30,000 souls to an untimely grave, and saddled futurity with60,000,OOOJ. of debt—let no more such costly struggles be stultified without a blow, and all the advantages gained wiped out by the plucky despatch of the nation we defeated with such difficulty, and by such sacrifices. Do not stand this country being subjected to periodical panics because a Govern ment, to gain popularity, and to keep the reins of power in their own hands, reduces the army and navy of this country to such a miserable condition of weakness that, ^ hen the country is insulted before all the world, she dare not, because she cannot, resent it, or take up that position which her power and history entitle her to. Let not Bottom the Weaver any more act the part of the Lion—as he did in the Midsummer Night's Dream— whose part was nothing but roaring, and who promised that he would so aggravate his voice, lest he should frighten the audience, that he would roar like a very sucking-dove. This is the position the British Lion has been reduced to of late; and I warn you, while there is yet time, not to play that dangerous game too long, lest, at last, aggressive Europe believes you will never fight more, and will so act that you will be obliged to fight for dear life when totally unprepared for it. Learn, while there is yet time, that it is a duty w e, as Englishmen, owe to ourselves, our posterity, and our history, and to the foremost place our forefathers have won for us in the civilized world—by arms, by science, and by commeice to so do our duty in our day, that the glorious inheritance to which we have succeeded may be transmitted, intact and unsullied, to the British Empire of the future. I shall conclude my address to yon by a sentiment to which all good Conservatives will, I am sure, heartily respond— God save the Queen.46 APPENDIX.

The distinguished author of the following pamphlet, Baron Kuhn von Kuhnenfeld, having given me permission to place his name on the title-page, it gives me much pleasure, at the present moment, when the Central Asian question is at tracting general attention, to reprint his opinion of the great strategical importance of a Railway in the Valley of the Euphrates, and the remarkable forecast of Russian policy in the East which he wrote in 1858. A few remarks on the progress of Russia since the pamphlet was written will, I hope, not be thought out of place. That craving for a seaboard, which Baron Kuhn believes to be inherent in all inland nations, still exists in Russia, and until it is satisfied there can be no definite settlement of the so-called Eastern Question. One, and by no means the least important, of the results of the recent wars on the Continent, has been to give Germany complete command of the Baltic, and rudely dispel any dreams Russian statesmen may have entertained of obtaining pos session of the Sound. Foiled in this direction, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles still in the hands of a foreign power, and her distant ports inEastern Asia closed for half the year by ice, Russia will probably endeavour to carry out her Eastern policy with additional energy, and so reach the shores of the Mediterranean or Persian Gulf. The great importance of a complete conquest of the Caucasus is clearly shown in the following pages, and those who have followed the course of events in the East and remember the distressing details of the Circassian Exodus, will know how thoroughly Russia has succeeded in accomplishing it. During the Crimean War, successful operations in Trans-Caucasia would have forced the Russians to raise the siege of Kars, and probably have placed the allies in a position to demand that the Russian Boundary should be thrown back to the Kuban. Russia seems determined not to allow the Caucasus to be a source of weakness in any future war, for a railway is projected which will enable her to concentrate an overwhelming force on this point, and thus to operate either directly through Asia Minor towaWs Constantinople, or southwards towards Mesopotamia. In Central Asia the progress of Russia since she first invaded Turkistan in 18G4 has been rapid; in that year Chemkend was taken and part of Kokand annexed; in 18G5 the important city of Tashkend fell into her hands; in 1866 Khojend, and in 1868 Samarcand was captured, and Russia now really possesses the greater portion of Kokand and Bokhora.Since the commencement of 1872, when the pamphlet was printed in England, three events have occurred which are of considerable importance as regards the Eastern Question; the definition ot the northern boundary of Afghanistan as a line beyond which the Russians are not to extend their influence; the reported transfer of the liussian establishments at Krasnovodsk to Childshlar ; and the grant of a concession for a line of railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf. By the first Russia is enabled to extend her influence to Merv, which, as a strategical point, is of scarcely less importance than Herat, and is separated from it by an open, well-watered district. By the transfer of their establishments from Krasnovodsk to Chikishlar, if the report be true, the Russians would appear to have abandoned the result of four years labour, barracks, magazines, wharves, &amp;c., as well as the various schemes which have been proposed for obtaining direct communication between the Caspian and Turkistan by a road from Krasnovodsk to the Sea of Aral. .From Chikishlar, the most direct road to Turkistan, not passing through Persian territory, would be by the line of Turcoman forts to Merv, and thence through Bokhara; on this road Merv would form a convenient depot for stores and supplies, and if once the Turcoman tribes were brought under control, a little care would soon restore it to its former importance as one of the great centres from which the main lines ol com-munication radiate. The first of the Turcoman forts, Kizil Arvat, has already been taken by the Russians, and during the advance on Khiva this summer, a column will, not improbably, be de tached to capture the remaining forts, and thus cover the right flank of the army. Communication once established with Turkistan by this line, Khiva may well be left independent. The proposed line of Railway which is now being surveyed by Engi neers will run from Enselli on the Caspian via Resht, Kassivin, Teheran, Kum and Shiraz to the Persian Gulf, and open up direct communication between India and the Russian posts on the Caspian. Russia will never attempt a direct attack upon India, where her troops, harassed by fatiguing marches through the mountains, would be met by a highly disciplined force; her real objective is the Persian Gulf, and to any advance in this direction Persia can now offer no serious resistance. An attempt on the part of Russia to obtain pos session of the Persian Gulf would almost certainly lead to a war with England, and as the pamphlet points out, the actual conflict would probably take place on the plains of Mesopotamia. In such a case a Railway, such as the proposed Euphrates Line, would be of inestimable value to England, and enable her to enter on the struggle with every chance of success. C. W W. Fcbrtiary, 1873., ^ ( THE EUPHRATES VALLEY RAILWAY. BY F.M.L. BARON KTJHN VON KUHNENFELD, AU9TEIAN WAR MINI8TEB. The news of the recent Russian victory at Kokand reminded me of the following memoir which I wrote in 1858, but did not publish, though pressed to do so by friends, as I feared the opinions expressed in it might appear at that time rather hazardous and fanciful. Some of the conclusions have since proved to be true; and as, reasoning by analogy, Russia seems inclined to follow the path sketched out for her, I hesitate no longer in making my views on the subject known. Russia's sphere of action is not in the west; all her ell'orts to reach Constantinople are futile; battles fought on the Danube and in the Balkans are so much wasted8 energy; the whole tendency of her policy towards St. Sophia is a mistake, and she would really have made greater progress during the last century and a half if she had turned her attention to Asia instead of Europe. Russia's traditional and civilising mis sion lies in Asia; to raise from their degraded state a long series of races enervated by Oriental des potism, and steeped in superstition, and to spread amongst them Christian culture and morality—a task for which, as India shows, England is disquali fied by her narrow-minded egotism. If Russia consistently follows out the line of policy discussed in the following pages—and all we hear at intervals from Asia is in favour of the con jecture—Austria may rest assured that, for a long time to come, the interests of the two countries will no longer be antagonistic, and that her statesmen will find less difficulty in carrying out a decided policy in the southern portion of the Empire. At the last meeting of the British Association in Dublin, Major-General Chesney read a very in teresting paper, which has been published in Peter- mann's Mittheilungen for 1857, on the importance of the proposed Euphrates Valley Railway. Major-General Chesney, with Sir J. Macneill as Chief Engineer, was sent to Syria by the Company formed to carry out the project, to select the two termini, and obtain data for the preparation of detailed plans. His surveys extended from Antioch via Aleppo to the Euphrates. The result shows9 that there are but few serious difficulties to sur- mouut on that long line; for, as far as Aleppo, only two cuttings of any importance, and two bridges over the Orontes, will be neccessary. On the hard arid plains of Mesopotamia, between Aleppo and Basra (Bassorah), all difficulties arising from the nature of the ground entirely cease; and on the coast there is a place which would form a safe and convenient harbour for from thirty to thirty-five vessels. The cost of constructing the entire line was estimated by Sir J. Macneill at £6,000,000. After showing with what ease the proposed line might be made, Major-General Chesney endeavours to point out its commercial value to England and Turkey, and touches, though but slightly, on its political and military importance to Turkey as a means of defence against both Kussia and Persia. The military and political value of this line, briefly hinted at by Chesney, is really a matter of extreme moment, and has a far more decided bearing on the defence, not only of Turkey but of Persia, and the whole district lying between the Mediter ranean, the Caspian and the Indian Ocean than might at first be supposed. The great duty of every civilised state appears to be to develop fully all the resources of its population and soil, so that the status of the community may be assured, and the conditions of individual exis tence be improved and rendered more attractive and comfortable. The objects for which, during historic % B10 times, man has struggled and striven, and lor wliicli he has suffered and fought, are, according to recent analysis, but different fonns of one irresistible longing for the assurance and amelioration of the varied conditions of our existence, and of the craving for political security and material pros perity. Although the development of agriculture, in dustry, and commerce, the basis of this material prosperity, is due to internal rather than external causes, still, a disadvantageous geographical position, restricted trade with neighbouring civilised states, and above all want of access to the Ocean, that ' Bridge of- Nations,' as Hegel calls it, can more or less impede its natural path, or injure the commerce to such an extent that its real value melts away and becomes disproportionate to the size of the country and its population. When this has been the case, nations, from the most remote times, have, consciously or instinctively, become aggressors, and leaving their distant homes in the centres of conti nents have endeavoured to acquire a seaboard and obtain a share in the maritime commerce of the world. The first efforts of Russia, with her vast territory and population, carried her to the Baltic, and sub sequent ones have brought her to the Black Sea. The long succession of war and victory which se cured these outlets to the sea, has, however, in both north and south, only given her access to inland11 seas and lines of water communication commanded or easily closed by foreign nations. Hence her craving for a seaboard has not yet been satisfied, and the struggle to obtain it is not finished. The complete possession of the Baltic Sound, though kept in view by Russian statesmen, must be reserved for a distant and uncertain future, and must be looked upon, for the present, as a secondary object of Eussian policy, the pursuit of which might lead to a contest to which she does not yet feel equal. The attainment of the gate of the Mediter ranean, which is held by a feeble and rapidly de clining state, and where also strong and numerous sympathies and religious affinity seem to invite the conqueror, appears to be far easier and more re munerative. Two roads lead to the conquest of this important point. In Europe, by way of Adrianople using the Lower Danube as a base; in Asia, by a direct move ment, via Armenia and Asia Minor with the Cau casus and line of the Kur as base. It is true that the European is much the shorter of these two lines of operation, and that it is the one which leads most quickly to the goal, but all those interested in maintaining the £ status quo in Europe would oppose its use. Austria above all, threatened in the highest degree by a hostile advance of Russia on this line, would either directly or indirectly bring her full weight to bear on the strategic defile, between the Carpathians12 and the Black Sea, through which the road to the conquest of Constantinople lies, and she would endeavour, by pressure in that direction to prevent any victorious advance of the Russian arms. As long as Austria is neither overthrown nor her freedom of action paralysed by other means, a Russian conquest of Constantinople is impossible. Lastly, such a war would see all Germany in arms, supported by England the chief enemy of Russia, and then possibly Germany, forced to a better comprehension of her mission, and bringing into play her superior intellectual, moral, and physical powers, might rouse herself to a grand historic deed and drive the great stalking spectre back within its proper limits. Russia's path to the con quest of Constantinople leads over Austria, and in order to secure the right flank and rear of her line of advance she must throw down the gauntlet to the whole of Central Europe, and commence a war for which she would hardly yet feel equal, even if the development of her internal prosperity had been far greater than it has been. At the same time that State which Russia looked upon as rotten to the core, and believed she could overthrow with comparative ease, has slowly, but surely, been gaining strength by adopting certain elements of the civilisation of Western Europe and by reorganizing its army on the best European models. By applying the principles of the latest system of state fortification Turkey has also13 increased her powers of defence so mnch that, with the assistance of a foreign fleet to blockade the Russian squadrons in the ports of the Black bea, she would be in a position to offer serious obstacles to the advance of a Russian army, on the Danube and in the passes of the Balkan. The difficulties which attend a conquest of the Dardanelles by this line were very clearly shown during the last Russian War. As soon as the entry of the Anglo-French fleet into the Black Sea stopped the transport of supplies along this line of water communication, it became evident, bearing in mind the campaign of 1828-29, that the Russian offensive could not reach the Balkans, much less cross them, even if Austria had not abandoned her absolute neutrality and thus dan gerously cramped the narrow base ol the Russian operations between the Black Sea and the Cai- pathians. In view of such obstacles and the possibility ot becoming involved in a war with Central Europe if she make use of the line of the Danube and Balkan, Russia will, in future, probably try to satisfy her craving for an open seaboard by operating through Asia. On this line Russia would come into conflict with Turkey as ruler of Asia Minor, Armenia' Mesopotamia and Syria, with Persia, and at last, indirectly, with England as holder of the fetiaits of Ormuz, which connect the Persian CjuII and Indian14 Ocean. On the other hand Europe would be at a distance from the seat of war, Central Europe would not be directly threatened, and it is extremely doubtful whether the latter would con sider the indirect, though none the less serious, consequences of Russian advances in Asia of suffi cient importance to induce her to make a powerful diversion and engage in a life and death struggle with European Russia for the sake of meeting a distant danger. Strong opposition on the part of Europe is not very probable if the aggressive policy of Russia takes this direction, as it is certain that she will not reach the shores of the Persian Gulf in one stride, or by means of one great war. Russia will proceed slowly and cautiously, taking advantage of continental complications, when the attention and energy of European States are engaged in contests more nearly concerning them, she will endeavour to reach the Persian Gulf step by step, by annexing separate districts of Armenia, by operating against Khiva and Bokhara, and by seizing Persian provinces. This is as full of danger to Persia as it is to Asiatic Turkey, for Russia cannot turn upon the latter until she has secured her left flank, and enlarged her base of operations by the previous seizure of Azerbidjan, by the occupation in force of the southern shore of the Caspian and by the protection by fortification of an island near Asterabad. These conquests and15 that of Armenia, which must speedily follow, would enable Eussia to bring her full weight to bear on the Euphrates and Tigris districts, and the whole of Persia—and once in possession of this country (Armenia), Syria and Asia Minor must also fall to her. On one side she would advance at a stride to the Mediterranean, and obtain the whole of its fine coast; on the other to the Persian Gulf, which would give her access to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. By consistently following an offensive policy and advancing gradually southwards from the narrow district between the 13 lack and Caspian Seas, Eussia will, at the same time, reach two seas and come into contact with the open ocean. By holding exclusive possession of the Caspian basin ' and the Persian Gulf, Eussia would threaten the remaining portion of Iran, Afghanistun, Beloo- chistan, Khiva which has already been menaced, Bokhara, a strategical point of the highest import ance whence caravan roads lead in all directions, and consequently the Indian possessions of Lug- land ; she would become in fact mistress of Central Asia. The most important lines which Eussia must keep in view for these great conquests, ami e\ ent- ually follow, are : 1. The line from Kars to the valley of the Euphrates and Mesopotamia. 2. That from Erivan by Lake Van to Mossul in16 the valley of the Tigris, to Mesopotiunia and thence after junction with the first line to Bagdad. 3. That from Tabreez to Schuster in the valley of the Kercha where it joins 4. the road leading from Teheran by Ispahan to Schuster and thence to the Persian Gulf. To operate on these lines with safety it is neces sary that the base between the Caspian and Black Seas should be fully secured. One of the first steps must be the complete conquest of the Cau casus, which is crossed by only two main roads; and then the enlargement of the base by annexing Armenia and Azerbidjan and so on. Once in possession of the Euphrates the road to the Mediterranean, via Aleppo and Antioch, and to the conquest of Asia Minor and Syria, is but short. It is clear from what has been said that all these lines are intersected by the line of the Euphrates, which, running in an oblique direction from the head of the gulf north of Antioch to the Persian Gulf, passes along the diagonal of a great quadri lateral which has its two western corners on the Mediterranean, its two eastern on the Caspian and Persian Seas, and so takes all Eussian lines of advance in flank. From this it is evident that the secure possession of the Euphrates line is decisive as regards the ownership of all land lying within the quadrilateral. It must therefore be the political17 and strategical task of llussia to get the Euplinitos line into lier liands, and tliat of lier enemies to prevent lier doing so at any cost. The great importance of a Eailway along this decisive line which connects Ajitioch with the Persian Gulf, follows as a matter of course. It is the only means by which it would be possible to concentrate at any moment, on the Euphrates or in the northern portion of Mesopotamia, a force sufficiently strong to operate on the flanks of the Russian line of advance and stop any forwaid movement. This far-seeing scheme of conquest cannot of course be realised in one campaign; it will take a series of wars and perhaps be the work of at least two generations. Looking at the question without bias and with a just appreciation of the historic mission of Hussia, and of the ends which she seeks to attain by territorial expansion, there is no doubt that her policy will be directed more and more towards Asia, and will follow the course indicated. To carry this out she must abandon her aggiessue policy in Europe, and refrain from interference in the politics of Central Europe. The maintenance of profound peace with Central Europe, the re duction of the military force on her western frontier, as far as may be consistent with the safety of Poland, and the subjugation of the Lesgian and Circassian tribes of the Caucasus, are thus indis-18 pensable preliminary aims of the Asiatic policy of Russia. The more completely we realise all these cir cumstances, the more fully do we appreciate the vast importance to Russia of a complete pacifica tion of the Caucasus, and of a thorough subjugation of its independent and warlike tribes,* in view of the great contest for supremacy which must event ually take place between England and Russia, and which will probably be fought out on the plains of the Euphrates and Tigris. The means which England has latterly taken to dispute the possession of the Caucasus—that important gate of Central Asia which lies between the Black and Caspian Seas—with Russia, have been quite insuffi cient, and have, to the present time, been confined to providing the Circassians with arms and ammu nition. If English statesmen had more thoroughly understood these points, instead of landing their army near Sevastopol during the last war against Russia (1853-56), they would have thrown it, with far more effect, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea. It would then have been possible for them, with the assistance of the warlike races of the * The extraordinary energy recently displayed in tlie con quest of these mountains, and the zealous promotion of emigration tl en masse' amongst the Circassian mountaineers, appear to indicate very clearly the change which has taken place in the Eastern policy of Russia.19 Caucasus, to drive the Russians out of Trans- Caucasia back to the Kuban, and to destroy in one or two campaigns all that has been achieved by Russia in this direction during a struggle of near fifty years. It is true that, at first, this natural and probable change in the aggressive policy of Russia in the East will only threaten the kingdoms of Turkey and Persia, but as neither one nor the other, nor both combined, would be strong enough, without assistance, to meet the danger successfully, Eng land must do so; and it is certain that she must sooner or later become engaged in a fierce contest for supremacy with Russia. The more apparent this change of policy on the part of Russia be comes, the more peremptory is it that England should oppose it by every means in her power, direct or indirect. In a direct manner, this oppo sition can only be made by concentrating all available forces, British, Turkish, and Persian, on the line of the Euphrates; it will therefore be of the greatest importance to assemble these mutually interested forces at any selected point on the line with the greatest possible rapidity. If India were once fully pacified, and a wiser administrat:On had rendered the inhabitants contented, it would cer tainly not be impossible to convey quickly a numerous and brave army, by means ol a steam flotilla, from Bombay and Kurachee through the20 Straits of Ormuz, which are only 720 miles from the latter harbour, to Bassorah, and effect a junction with the forces drawn from Europe by means of the Euphrates Valley Eailway. The Euphrates Valley Railway becomes there fore a factor of inestimable importance in the problem of this great contest. Even now the con struction of the line will counteract the Asiatic policy of Russia, for it will strengthen the influence of England in Central Asia and weaken that of Russia. It will also hasten the dissemination of European culture and civilisation in those lands, and bring the Asiatic races under the influence of the spirit stirring in Western Europe instead of under that of Russia, and it will strengthen and train them for the coming struggle. If the entire line is completed, the following branch lines will be of no mean importance, viz. at one end, from Aleppo to the Upper Euphrates Valley, to Kharput, and perhaps Erzeroum; in the centre from Annah to Mossul; and at the other end from Bassorah by Schuster and Ispahan to Teheran. The growth of Russia in the East threatens, though indirectly, the whole of Europe, as well as the three states named above, for if she were firmty established in Asia Minor the real apple of discord, Constantinople, would be in imminent danger, all the commerce of the Mediterranean would fall into her hands, and she would command the Canal* 21 which is about to be cut through the Isthmus of Suez. It is necessary that any counter measures should be previously organized, as Russia will doubtless endeavour to prepare her attack long beforehand; this however is more than the States of Central Europe seem inclined to do, occupied as they are with the solution of questions which are more urgent and more nearly concern them. If they do not wish to awake from fancied secunty when it is too late to offer resistance, they must keep a sharp eye on the Asiatic policy of Russia, and not allow themselves to be deceived or hoodwinked by the distance and obscurity of the theatre or by the peaceful condition of affairs on the western frontier of Russia. The proposed construction of the Euphrates Line shows at all events that England has per ceived these dangers in time. Whatever may be the commercial value of the Suez Canal to Central Europe, there is no doubt that it is secondary in importance to the Euphrates Railway, which affords the only means of stemming Russian advances in Central Asia, and which directly covers the Suez Canal. These considerations explain the resistance, so little understood, which England has made to the piercing of the Isthmus of Suez. England not only wishes to invest her capital in that line, whichV 22 seems most important to the maintenance of her East Indian possessions, she desires also to obtain good interest on the money laid out by forcing the East Indian traffic, which would otherwise un doubtedly take the cheaper route through the Canal, to follow this line.

A kind and genial reception, and the expression of luvourablc opinions from those whose presence at the reading was, of itself, an honour, have induced me to print this very rough summary of a very important subject. Notwithstanding the somewhat ambitious title of the Paper, no pretensions to supply in it a history, or even a key to a complex question, is advanced. But it is not impossible that the perusal of the following pages may lead to a study of comprehensive works ; and, in some cases, such study may not unnaturally tend to the prosecution of further and fuller inquiries; which process, again, may result in the acquisition of knowledge fitting the possessor, at some future period, to grapple with an eventuality wbich, whatever its substance, casts beforehand the shadow of a difiiculty. In such contingency, the map for which I am indebted to the courteous intervention of General Adye, and of which the Lecture was rather designed to be explanatory than vice versa, will not have been exhibited or interpreted in vain. H astings, 29th March, 1873.* 2 CENTRAL ASIA, AND ITS QUESTION. T owards the close of the past year the interest of a large section of the British public was fairly aroused to certain regions which, in spite of classical associa tions and medieval repute, had, as a rule, either passed away from the recollection, or failed to maintain the continuous attention of modern English politicians. And to judge from the mass of newly- printed and newly-spoken opinions on this one topic which almost every day brings forth in our metro polis of many interests, it cannot be said that the excitement thus awakened has subsided or even diminished. The subject in question has been rather vaguely characterized as that of 'Central Asia.' I say ' vaguely,' because the centre is somewhat uncer tain. Are we to take meridians of longitude or parallels of latitude, or both, to find it ? For our present purpose the matter may be appropriately considered under two heads :— 1st. What is meant by the term ' Central Asia' geographically, and with reference to other parts of the vast Asiatic Continent ? 2ndly. What is meant by the ' Central Asian Question ' ?( i ) Practically, however, we shall find that an expo sition of the geographical status will leave little to be said in the way of defining a political complica tion inseparable from it. In giving to the paper which I am about to read this evening the title of 'Central Asia, or the Coun tries between Europe and British India,' I have proposed to treat mainly of that quasi-central part of the largest division of the globe which would be comprehended under the second and more minute definition. Indeed, I shall only be following the example of newspaper controversialists and lecturers of the day if, in speaking of Central Asia as it is found on the map, I confine myself to those countries east of the Caspian but west of Chinese territory which have acquired a special interest in connection with the popular designation, without accepting the more comprehensive interpretations warranted by a stricter adherence to geography. And were it not that Persia, Afghanistan, and even Baluchistan belong, more or less, to the political case to be set before you, I should have been content to have sub stituted the simple name of ' Turkistan'' for that now adopted, in the sense in which the compound term ' Central Asia ' is commonly received. This Turkistan comprises not merely Trans-Oxiana, but the countries of the Western centre of Asia, and therefore Khiva, as well as Bokhara, Khokand, Yar- kand, and the Russian conquests exhibited like a wedge driven m southward amid the independentKliaiuites, i. e. territories of the iutlependeut khans or chiefs. And here, it may be said, it is that the public interest is at this particular moment concen trated. Let us briefly review these Khanates ac cording to their position on the map. khiva. First, on the westward, there is Khiva. This province, known to history as Kharazm, and by its neighbours as Urganj, holds, according to A ambe'ry, the former appellation from a Persian word signify ing ' warlike.' Orientals habitually account for the names of places in the wildest and most incongruous manner; but I confess to miss even the word alluded to in the present instance. Nor can I gather more satisfactory information from Richardson, who gives currency to a fanciful derivation of the name from a Persian expression of Cyrus. It seems to me, how. ever, that we may be content to accept, as fact, that the Kharazmis of Eastern annals are the ( horasmi * (^opao-ju-tot) of Herodotus, described by Lempriere as ' a people of Asia near the Oxus. There is no actual lack of published notices of Khiva, and many of these are readily procurable for reference. Vambery's comparatively recent journey has been for ten years before the public in its Eng lish dress, and possesses the sensational element to a sufficient extent to make it exceptionally attrac tive. Abbott's two interesting volumes, andShaks- * Gaisford's ' Ilovodotus,' vol i., I halia 0^.( c ) peare's and Taylour Thomson's short narratives, are equally the result of actual visits, effected at least within the last forty years, and by Englishmen. Col. Sheil, once H.M. Minister in Persia, in his notes to Lady Sheil's * Life and Manners' in that country, published in 1856, states that two English men, named Thomson and Hogg, undertook, almost alone, a journey from Asiatic Russia to Khiva; that their adventures are shortly described in Jonas Hanway; and that they were probably the first Englishmen who beheld the t'zbek capital. But I think there is evidence that one of our countrymen, Mr. Anthony Jenkinson, sent out by the Muscovy Company, was there, or at least in the province, more than 300 years ago: for we find him at three days' journey from the old mouth of the Oxus in the Cas pian Sea, entertained by a chief named Azim Khan, who with his brethren ' ruled all from the Caspian Sea to Urgence.'* Now Urgence must be Urganj, and we learn that our traveller moved from his en tertainer's camp towards Bokhara, or eastward. 1 may mention that the repast of which he partook on the occasion noted consisted of the flesh of a wild horse and mare's milk without bread.f Mouraviev's journey to Khiva in 1819-20 is also a well-written and instructive report. But I shall have to refer to more than one Russian work as I * According to Purchas, the original edition of whose * Pilgrims' was published in 1617. t Purchas's ' Pilgrims,' p. 480.( 7 ) go on ; and it may suffice here to state that Russian s explorations have not been infrequent in these tracts since the days of Mouraviev. Many authors, English as well as foreign, have also described this part of Central Asia without per- . sonal knowledge or experience of the locality. Among these, well-known names might be cited ; few perhaps with greater respect than that of Sir John Malcolm, whose ' History of Persia' cannot but pos sess great value for the Oriental student. In that work, while reviewing a series of revolutions in Persia for 500 years, or from the accession of Ismael Samani to the conquests of Jenghiz Khan and Taimur, he makes occasional mention of Khiva under its name of Kharazm. During this period, extending from a.u . 874 to 1380, it was assailed by the Seljuk Tartar Alp Arslan, who has the credit of having bridged the Oxus. Some notion of the power oi this remarkable monarch may be gathered from the statement that he ruled from that river to the deserts of Arabia. He defeated and took prisoner Romanus, surnamed Diogenes, who married the widow of Constantine XI. Malik Sanjar, also, another of the Seljuk monarchs and virtually King of Persia, bestowed, we are informed, Kharazm on his cup-bearer; and the descendant of the latter, named Takush, was strong enough to defeat and kill Toghral III., a successor of Sanjar.* * a.u . 1193. Malcolm's ' History of Persia,' vol. i., p. 380.( 8 ) Yet nowhere does Khiva or Kharazm appear with any historical distinctiveness, nor have we. requisite material to attempt the exhumation of its annals as an isolated State, even if the task were possible of accomplishment. I have alluded to the great Tartar invasion; and in the Uzbeks who rule in Khiva, and have probably ruled there for centuries, we still find a Tartar race. Lieut. Wood, the explorer of the Oxus, an officer whose labours have, unfortu nately, only become appreciated now that he has passed away from his sphere of usefulness, thus speaks of them:— ' A tribe of Tartar, or rather Scythian, origin, which in a comparatively modern era crossed the Jaxartes and fixed themselves in Trans Oxiana. The descendants of the ruthless Jenghiz Khan then oc cupied that country, but were soon forcibly dispos sessed. Their chief, the renowned Baber, after vainly endeavouring to stem the torrent of invasion, yielded to its strength, and led his forces into Hin- dostan, where he established the Moghul Empire, called after Moghul Khan, the founder of his line. Those of the disinherited nation who neither sub mitted to the Uzbek nor accompanied their chief, re tired across the river Oxus; and in the Turkomans of that locality I think we may recognize their de scendants. .... Though the language of the various hordes that now roam over Central Asia are different, there is reason to believe that the Huns of( 9 ) antiquity are the prototypes of them all, whether designated Kalmuks or Kirgiz, Uzbek, or Turko man. . . . The Uzbeks are semi-Muhamadans, and consider an intolerant persecution of the other sect as the best evidence of the sincerity of their own faith and of their attachment to the Prophet. They are much fettered by their priests, to whom they yield implicit obedience in all things temporal and spiritual.' * This character, though applied especially to the Uzbeks of Kunduz, a State within the now declared limits of Afghanistan, will doubtless serve to de scribe, with truth, the Uzbeks of Khiva and in Tur- kistan generally. If we are to believe Muhamadan writers, and AbulgMzi, the one concerned, is perhaps among the more trustworthy, Tatar and Mongol were two brothers whose names became generic appellations of thousands of Asiatic families; the orthography of the former having been modified by the Latin writers of the thirteenth century, who, with a certain suspicious significance, introduced the lettci v at the end of the first syliable.f * ' Journey to the Source of the Oxus,' Murray, 1872, pp. 140, 141. f Mr. Arthur Lumley Davids writes ; ' Some of the Eastern writers have derived the name Tatar from a river, on the banks ot which was the original seat of this tribe; but all coincide in employing the term as the designation of a particular body of people, and not as that of a race. The alteration of this name into Tartar by the Latin writers ^ the thirteenth century appears to have arisen from the similarity of its sound to their own Tartarus, the corruption being rendered somewhat( 10 ) The inhabited part of Khiva is estimated at less than 200 miles from north to south, and 100 from east to west ;* and is confined to the lower section of the Oxus, south of the Sea of Aral. The re mainder of the Khanate, or rather the outlying country acknowledging in any way the sovereignty of the Khan, may be considered, with few excep tions, a perfect desert. The principal places in the cultivated and populated lands are Yenghi, or New Urganj, and Khiva the capital. Kohnah, or Old Urganj, once the capital, is now reduced to insigni- hcance, and of its former splendour there only re main two ruins of towers of the same massive designs as the other towers of Central Asia. Vam- bery eulogizes the fertility of the soil, and considers the corn, rice, silk, cotton, and a dye-yielding root called ' ruyan,' especially excellent. As regards the fruits, he holds that not Persia and Turkey alone, but even Europe itself would find it difficult to contest their superior merit. He instances apples, peaches, pomegranates, and, above all, melons 're nowned as far even as remote Pekin, so that the appropriate by the terrors which the incursions of Tchingis Khan and his descendants excited.' And he quotes the words of St. Louis to his mother as remarkable, hereon: ' Erigat nos, mater, cceloste solatium, quin, si perveniant ipsi, vel nos ipsos quos vocamus Tartaros, ad svas Tartaraes sedes unde exierunt retrudemus, vel ipsi nos omnes ad ccelum advehent.'—Preliminary discourse to ' Grammar of the Turkish Lan guage,' Parbury and Allen, 1832. * Burnes: ' Travels into Bokhara; General and Geographical Memoir on Part of Central Asia,' 2nd edition, Murray, 1835.( 11 ) Sovereign of the Celestial Empire never forgets, when presents flow to him from Chinese Tartary, to beg for some Urganji melons.' Among manufac tures, the Urganj striped, two-coloured, stuff dress ing-gown, the Hazarasp gown, and the Tash-hanz linens, as also the brass of Khiva, are cited. The trade is with Russia, Persia, and Herat, but chiefly with the first.* The inhabitants consist of Uzbeks, Turkomans, Karakalpaks, Kazaks, Sarts, and Persians. Of these the Uzbeks may be described as fixed cultivators of the soil, dwelling under the protec tion of their own legitimate chief. Yambery does not hesitate to give them a good character, add ing that the Khivan Uzbek not being well instructed in the doctrine of the Muhamadanism which he professes, retains not only many of the national usages of heathenism, but also of the religious observances of the Parsis or Fire-wor shippers. These, I need scarcely tell you, were the ancient inhabitants of Persia, converted or driven out by the early Muhamadan invaders, excepting from the account the few families settled still at Yezd, Kirman, and one or two other cities. The Turkomans are divided into numerous tribes, and are scattered in hordes along the northern frontier of Persia, and north-west of Afghanistan. * Vanibcry : 'Travels in Central Asia,' Murray, 1861.( 12 ) Those in Khiva Proper belong chiefly to three tribes, of whom I will speak anon. The Karakalpak, Blackcaps, inhabit the farther bank of the Oxus, but have been subject to Khiva from time immemorial. Yambery states their num ber to be computed at 10,000 tents. Of the Kazaks but few are subject to Khiva. The Sarts are the ancient Persian population of Kharazm, and called, as elsewhere, Tajik; and the so-called Persian section of the population are colonists or slaves. Many of the latter, however, as lately explained by Mr. Mitchell with reference to Russian prisoners, prefer an easy livelihood in Khiva, to taking advantage of liberty, if offered on condition of returning to their homes. When Mr. Taylour Thomson was at Khiva in 1841, he learned that the population from where the Khan collected his revenues amounted to 100,000 families: that he had an army of 30,000 horsemen, with 17 guns and a mortar, besides 100 regular soldiers and a Russian artilleryman; that he possessed, moreover, 500 men slaves of his own, and 4000 in the employment of subjects on the State lands * BOKHARA.

It is mentioned in the open ing sections of the eighth book, later in which is related the murder of Clytus, and where Alexander s conquests of the Massagetse, Dahae, and Sogdiani appear to have been accomplished. Sogdiana, if not the province of Bokhara itself, must have been in its immediate vicinity. Samarcand is, in fact, situated in the valley of the Sogd. According to a Russian authority, M. Yeniukofl', that part of the Oxus which skirts Bokhara, and, indeed, an extent of 540 miles along its banks, from Balkh to Fitnek, a southern limit of populated Khiva, is a sultry valley in which, while there are towns and villages at the ferries or intersections ol karavan routes, there are but few fixed inhabitants. At Charjui, a point within this range, he gives to the river a breadth of 235 and a depth of 4 fathoms, but is not sanguine as to its ever becoming a commercial highway between l^urope and India.* The distance from Khiva to Bokhara by the high road (one of three recognized routes) is laid down at 60 parasangs, or perhaps 210 miles, in eight marches averaging not less than 26 miles each. The tii*st march of 21 miles is through a cultivated * ' The Pamir and Sources of the Amu-Daria. —Journal of the Royal Geographical Society for 1866.( 14 ) country rich Lu mulberry trees, and within an hour from the Oxus ferry, at this point so wide that both banks are barely visible at the same time. The second march takes the traveller across the river; and the third, out of Khiva territory, through a fair amount of cultivation on the right bank, to the edge of the Tartary desert, where the Kirgiz find pasturage for their flocks. The next two marches hug the cultivated strip along the river side, avoiding as much as possible the sandy wastes on the left hand. From the point then attained the caravan road is again beside the river for between 30 and 40 miles, whence begins the passage of the desert in earnest, a task which must be faced if Bokhara be the goal in prospect ; and this trial is undergone for some 00 miles before the propinquity of the city is made known by canals, cultivated fields, and finally, most grateful gardens. Yarnbery seems to have turned at once to the desert from the fifth march, and thus experienced a hundred miles of suffering and privations under a hot July sun.* On Bokhara there is unquestionably fuller and more detailed information than on Khiva. At present I will not attempt anything like a correct list of travellers thither, whose personal experience of the country has been recorded. Names which naturally occur to me are those of the brothers * VamWry, whose description is well worth referring to at pp. ICO, 1G1.J y: ■' wi ( 15 ) Xicolo and Maffeo Polo in the thirteenth, and Mr. Anthony Jenkinson in the sixteenth century; in later years Baron Meyendorff and other Russian officers; among Englishmen, Burnes, Conolly, Stoddart, Dr. Wolff, and more; among foreigners generally, M. Yambe'ry is eminent; but I may here casually men tion that there are recorded far more than 100 names of travellers, chiefly Russians, who visited Central Asia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, (ieneral Ignatiev, now and for many years past Russian Ambassador at the Porte, has, I believe, published a narrative of his travels in Central Asia. When at Constantinople some eight or ten years ago, I heard him speak of his residence in Bokhara. Though a recognized official visitor there, he was in a kind of imprisonment, and those who brought him his food were made to taste it before him in token that it was innocuous. The fact is, that this particular region, though farther from the natural boundaries of Europe and European civilization, has been found more acces sible and less isolated by surrounding deserts than Khiva. Nor has the latter over attained the world wide reputation of Bokhara, which, at least in the estimation of Muhamadans, is the seat of exceptional learning and sanctity. But it has lost much of its greatness in recent years, and has forfeited the privilege of practical independence still retained by its old rival and enemv. Of the eight natural and r( 16 ) political divisions of the kingdom or khanate re corded by Barnes, it may be doubted whether more than half now nominally remain; and even the actual frontiers given many years later by Vambe'ry have been modified to the detriment of the reigning Amir. The deserts north and west, and the Oxus south, still serve to mark the limits in those direc tions ; and on the left bank of the Oxus, Charjui and Karki belong also to Bokhara; but it is no longer bounded by Khokand on the east, for Samarkand, Tashkand, and Khojand intervene in their new geographical classification, as parts of Russian Turkistan. Vambery thinks two millions and a half not too high a figure for the estimated popula tion, and divides them into Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kirgiz, Arabs, Mar vis, Persians, Hindus, and Jews. The first is the dominant tribe, and is that of the ' Amir,' a title which seems rather to belong to Bokhara than to Khiva; the Tajiks, similar to the Sarts, or Persian aborigines, are in great number also; the Kirgiz are few. The Arabs, reckoned at 60,000, are the con querors from the south, whom, it is presumed, we must hold responsible for the local Arabic names, such as Mawar 'al Nahr, and many others. Indeed, the native name of the Oxus, ' Amu,' shown by Colonel Yule, the editor of ' Marco Polo,' to have been ' Al Nahr,'* the river, in earlier Muhamadan * See the exhaustive and interesting introduction to Lieut.Wood's book before quoted. •( 17 ) history, is not improbably a vulgarism derived from ' Um al Nahr,' or ' the mother of rivers,' a title strictly warranted by precedent and common usage among Arabs in regard to so remarkable a stream. Balkh, for example, is called the ' Um 'al Bilad,' mother of cities. The Marvis are descended from Persian captives taken at Marv more than sixty years ago. The Per sians, like those of Khiva, are in compulsory or voluntary slavery; and recent Russian report places them in number at the high figure of 10,000. Of the Hindus I can speak from personal know ledge, as it was my lot to reside for many months at Shikarpur, in Upper Sind, the great depot, as it were, for Bokhara Hindus. They are industrious, plodding traffickers and usurers, content to leave their houses and families to manage the money transactions of Persians, Afghans, and Uzbeks, men of a different creed and totally different mould from themselves; and living in self-imposed exile until they outgrow domestic affections, or become strange to their own kin. Vambe'ry reckons that there are 500 of them in Bokhara; and of the Jews about 10,000. The latest Russian authorities, however, reduce the number of the latter to some 2000. The Hindu merchants find their way to Bokhara and back by the Bolan Pass, Kandahar, Kabul, and Khulm. When Burnes visited Bokhara in 1832, he( 18 ) reckoned the population of the city to amount to 150,000. Captain Kostenko, in 1870, basing his calculations on an estimate of 15,000 houses only, diminishes the sum total to 74,000, or one-half. He reckons the infantry soldiers to consist of 10,000, and the artillery of 1000 men, and states that the Amir keeps 300 cavalry and 3000 foot besides in Hissar. Of the infantry hardly 200, he says, are provided with even flint guns, and of 200 guns in store, scarcely twenty are fit for use. The climate is described by Burnes as salubrious and pleasant, dry, and in the winter very cold, proved by the freezing of the Oxas. The summer heat rarely exceeded 90° in the capital, though in the desert it was above 100. Besides the Oxus there is a river called the Zarafshan, rising in the mountains south of Kokhand, which passes north of Samarkand and Bokhara, and fertilizes the lands near both towns. The Sir, or Jaxartes, is now no longer within the Amir's dominions, as it was in Burnes's time. Ka- rakol, Karshi, and Karki, deserve mention among the more important towns still under his control. The vegetable productions of the country are tolerably abundant, and fruits are celebrated. The sheepskins and goats' wool are well known, and much esteemed in Persia and Afghanistan. To summarize in a few words the history of Bok hara—the aborigines w r ere a Persian population, and for centuries, perhaps, subjects of the vast( 19 ) Persian empire of old. Nor did the Arab invasions and innovations, on the spread of Mnhamadanism, change their immediate allegiance in this respect. But the incursion of the Mongols was attended with different results; and, lastly, the Uzbeks became rulers, to the exclusion of the Persians. New revo lutions ensued, and conquests and losses of territory followed one the other for a series of years. The Uzbeks still maintain the sovereign power, and religious fanaticism has increased in a high degree under their favour and support. It is just thirty years ago that Colonel Stoddart, after painful years, and Captain Conolly, after painful months, of cap tivity, were cruelly murdered in Bokhara by sanction or order of the Amir, Nasr Ullah, father to the present Amir, Saiad Muzafar; and the tale is a sad one to be told to Englishmen of Englishmen. In consider ing it, we have at least the satisfaction of feeling that both officers met their final fate as Christian soldiers and gentlemen; and that their services, though unrewarded, and sufferings, though un avenged, have not failed to secure to their memories the sympathy of survivors, as also of future gene rations. KHOKAND. The mode of writing Khokand, according to our latest maps, is not that invariably adopted. 1 have seen it spelt Khokan, Koukan, Kokaun, Kokun, and o 2( 20 ) Khokand. Yambery, adopting the last, makes tlie word a possible corruption of ' Khubkand,' a beau tiful spot. Without venturing any decided opinion hereon, I think that ' kand' must be the second syllable, where such important places as Yarkand and Tashkand are found east and west of it; and the word ' Farghdnah,' which all writers agree to have been its more ancient name, conveys a Perso- Arabic signification of pleasurable repose, not out of character with the Persian ' Khub.' When Burnes wrote of the country, the power of its chief, Muhamad Ali, was on the rise ; he had established his influence over Tashkand, and many of the Kazak tribes between him and Russia. He was, moreover, disputing with the Mir of Kunduz the right to Darwaz, a district now included within the Afghan frontier. The present chief has but a narrowly circumscribed tract of Independent Tartary to call his own. He has Russian annexations north and west; Shahr Sabz, a questionable district of Bokhara, with the Kdratau Mountains to the south west and south; and Yarkand to the east and south east. Burnes remarked that, while Khokand did not hold much intercourse with Bokhara, the commu nication between it and Constantinople was more regular than that of the other states of Turkistan; and that this practice was in vogue long after Burnes wrote, I can answer from personal know ledge. Among many photographs collected by me( 21 ) in the course of travel and duty, is one of a Khokand Envoy to the Porte, with whom I had much talk at Karachi, on his way to Constantinople, vid Bombay and the Red Sea. He was in manner, in dress, and in physique, the Uzbek of Turkistan, and his Turkish approximated sufficiently to what is called the Osmanli of Constantinople to enable us to understand each other. But this mission, and the missions of other envoys, have not been of avail to keep off the Russian enemy, and the Russians and the Khokandis have been left to fight it out without the intervention of a third power. Khokand is peopled by Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazaks, Kirgiz, of whom I have already spoken, and Kip- chaks. Yambery considers these last to typify the original Turkish race, and his judgment is formed from their physiognomy, character, lan guage, and customs. He professes inability to detect in the Turkish that they speak a single Persian or Arabic word; and classes them, as in bravery, superior to all nations of Central Asia, being ' the truest specimen remaining to us of the immense hordes that revolutionized all Asia.'* He states that they can only number from 5000 to 6000 tents; and yet the Khans of the Kipchak, sprung from Jenghiz, were once the ruling dynasty in Kazan, Astrakhan and dependencies up to a.d. 1506.f There were colonies of Jews in Namaghan * 1 Travels in Central Asia,' p. 383. f Bianchi and Kicfler,' Dictionuaire Turc-Franfais.' Paris, 1850.( 22 ) and Marghilan, but of these I can find no recent information. The capital town bears the name of the Khanate; and is said* to have 70,000, or according to late Russian authority, 100,000 inhabitants. It is placed in the latest maps on the right bank of a tributary of the Sir, or Jaxartes, formed by the junction of two streams rising in a western spur of the Alai Mountains. Burnes places it on both sides of the Sir, but then he wrote from hearsay. By the desert route and following a course almost due east, Kho- kand maybe reached from Khiva in about fifteen days; but the journey must be a trying one. The computa tion of 3,000,000 inhabitantsf for the whole Kbanate requires considerable reduction owing to the territo rial losses of the last few years. Tashkand alone, in 18GG, could boast of a population of 64,416.^ For the following summary of political events in Khokand I am again indebted to Yambery, who ap pears to me the best authority on this little-investi gated subject. The present reigning family pretends to a direct descent from Jenghiz Khan; but the family of Jenghiz was dethroned by Taimur; and after Baber, the last descendant of Taimur in Khokand, the Shaibani and other Kipchak and Kirgiz chiefs seized on the Government. The late ruling Khan, Muha- ♦ Maim lcr's ' Treasury of Geograpliy.' t Vambery. % ' Almanack de Gotha.' Russian accounts say about 100,000.( 23 ) mad Ali, was of Kipchak origin. He waged war with Nasr Ullah, Amir of Bokhara, in pursuance of an old family policy. Khokand had been incorpo rated into the former state and had forcibly freed itself, making alliance with Yarkand and certain neighbouring States now included within the Chinese dominions; and the consequence was a kind of chronic animosity between Khokand and Bokhara. Although the two hostile Khans above mentioned had died, that is the Bokhara chief had killed the chief of Khokand, and the survivor had been carried off by sickness, the contest was continued by their successors, and up to 1863 there seems to have been fighting without cessation. Peace was only obtained at that period by the division of the Khanate into two Governments, each under a grandson of Muha- mad Ali. The wars with Russia will be spoken of under the head of Russian Turkistan. YARKAND. From the town of Ush, on the eastern frontier of the Khanate of Khokand, to Kashgar is a ten days' journey over a mountainous country.* And a few marches farther in a south-easterly direction bring us to Yarkand and the countries immediately north of Cashmir and British India. Time will not allow of any detailed account of the interesting region of * Vambery.( 24 ) Eastern or Chinese Turkistan; but the records of the Royal Geographical Society have recently furnished many new and valuable data for its illus tration; and the appointment of Mr. Shaw, the indefatigable and intelligent Yarkland explorer, as Commissioner of Ladakh, is a warrant of progress in our relations with the people and lands north of the Karakorum. I will add a few words on the tracts north and south of the more westerly of the Khanates just discussed, viz. Khiva and Bokhara, without refer ence to the political question of sovereignty. East and west of the Sea of Aral, and generally from its centre northwards, is the country of whose brave queen and people Herodotus writes with some detail in the closing sections of his first book; a country now occupied by the Kirgiz nomads of the Steppes, a pastoral community bearing a reputation for valour certainly inferior to that gained by the conquerors of Cyrus, the Massagetee of 2000 years ago. While on this subject I may recall the account of Thomyris, the Boadicea of the Scythian plains, given by Hero dotus. Her address to the dead Cyrus, on dipping his head into a skin filled with human blood, will not readily be forgotten :* ' Thou hast destroyed me, living and conquering thee in fight, having taken my son by stratagem ; and I, as I have vowed, * Gaisford's 'Herodotus': ptv (fit {cdovadv rt kcu vixoxrav &lt;rf (iTrayXfcrns TracSa tov tXcov SoXco. at b eyco, Karanfp r ]nfiXr](Ta, mfiaros Koptrrco. —S. 214, Clio.( 25 ) will satiate thee with blood.' Ctesias, it is true, tells quite a different story. He goes farther East, apparently, in search of a similar legend, and makes Amorges, King of the Sacje, the conqueror of Cyrus, but does not kill him until some time afterwards in a war with the Derbices, when he is mortally wounded by an Indian.* Yambery, in opposition to Wood and others, but in accordance with the views of Sir Alexander Burnes, considers the Kirgizes to be the same as the Kazaks, and intelligibly explains the name Kirgiz to be a Turkish compound, meaning ' wan derer in the plains.' On the other hand, I ha\e one dictionary which translates the Tartar word 'Kazak' as 'robber'; but this interpretation appears to bear no original meaning, and to be admissible only by virtue of the predatory habits of the Cossacks themselves. Doubtless the compara tively peaceful habits of the Kirgiz on the more northerly shores of the Aral at the present day, are mainly, if not wholly, attributable to a icstiaining superior influence exercised over this particular territory. Uncontrolled, there is abundant evidence to prove their habits quite as predatory as pastoral. We learn, on good authority, that many years ago there were two routes to Khiva from Oienberg, the capital of the Grovernment of that name, and the most southerly of the old Kuropean Russian dis- • 4 Purchas, his Pilgrimage,' p. 401. London, 161( 26 ) tricts bounded by the Ural Mountains. One of these routes was east and the other west of the Sea of Aral. The former, according to M. Khanikoff, had its first authentic delineation by a mission of Messrs. Gladishef and Muravin, who performed the journey from Orsk to Khiva in 1740. In later times it was described to be about 1000 English miles in length, of which two-thirds passed through a barren, sandy country, the fertile and irrigated portions being for the most part those nearest Orenberg. The second, and more than a hundred miles the shorter, abounded also with water, pasturage, and fuel at the outset; then changed to salt marshes and waste; then rising to what is called the plateau, or table-land of the Ust Urt, afforded scanty pasturage and pre carious supplies of good water. Descending the Ust Urt on the southern side, and turning towards the populated parts of Khiva, it yielded sufficient fuel and water, and partial pasturage. To what extent these routes, or either of them, have been since rendered available for the march of troops or for the passage of caravans, intelligence is scarcely obtained with the same facility as for the several roads from the Caspian to Khiva. It is certain that in 1839 General Perovski's force, which attempted the more westerly of the two routes, was unable to advance farther than Ak Boulak, a post barely one- third of the whole distance which it was contem plated the army would traverse. Russian authori-( 27 ) ties mention the plateau of the Ust Urt to be 240 miles in length, and 160 in breadth, or the actual extent between the Caspian and Aral. It rises to an average elevation of 020 feet. South of the Khanates, to the east, is the Afghan, and west, the Persian, frontier. The former has been dissected in the political correspondence of the day, and the names of Badakhshan, Wakhan, the Panjah, and the G-okcha, will have become as familiar to those who interest themselves in these questions as the old names of Bactriana, Sogdiana, the Oxus and the Ochus, are to the classical student. The latter is divided from Kharazm by a kind of neutral zone occupied by the Turkomans, the most noted of Eastern highwaymen. A word also on the two great rivers of Central Asia, which are, in the west, indisputably the Jaxartes or Sihun, and Oxus or Jihun, called the Sir and Amu at the present day. The first is formed by minor rivers fed by streams issuing from the mountain ranges north and south of Khokand respectively, and the Narin, rising from the southern slopes of the Kirgiz Ala Tan, and north of the Tian-Shan. Below Namaghan it zigzags in a south-westerly course past Khokand, receives the waters of other streams from the southern hills, and turns abruptly north towards Tashkand to make a long north-westerly bend to the Upper Aral. 1 he waters forming the second, issue from the Kara Tau( 28 ) ranges north, and Hindu Kush south—to speak generally, from the western limits of the Pamiv table-land; and the junction of the -Surkhab and Panjah rivers from these particular directions be comes the larger volume of water called Amu Daria. This important river first receives the Gokchah in its passage from Badakhshan westward, then bending somewhat towards Kunduz and Balkh, on its south, takes a long, continuous sweep to the north-west, enriching Bokhara and wholly sustain ing Khiva, till it reaches the Lower Aral. EUSSIAN TURKISTAN. But our account of Turkistan, or West Central Asia, would indeed be incomplete were we to omit that important part of it which has been added to the Russian dominions. The numerous papers trans lated by Mr. Michell on the subject, independently of his own published memoranda, all references of high practical value, render the task of compiling an intelligible account comparatively facile. General Perovski, in relating the circumstances of his unfortunate expedition to Khiva in 1839, has prefaced his narrative by a historical sketch of Cen tral Asia, and the causes which led to direct Russian aggression. Commencing with a mission of the Bishop of Shernburg to India by way of the Caspian and Independent Tartary, the credit of which is given to Alfred the Great of England, he passes( 29 ) at once from the ninth to the thirteenth century, taking the latter period as a starting point for the maintenance of ' frequent intercourse between Europe and the Western portion of Central Asia for political and commercial objects.' He reviews the movements of the Crusaders, the Greeks, A enetians, and Genoese in Eastern Europe, and the invasion ol Jenghiz Khan from the east westwards; showing the result of such simultaneous action to be a necessary rapprochement of Europe to Asia, and vice versa. This was the especial feature of the thirteenth century, when the Polo family were foremost in the rank of distinguished travellers. 1 have seen a list of no less than thirty-five names, including those of the brothers Nicholas and Matthew, and the younger Marco, Polo, whose travels in Central Asia are said to have been recorded within a period of 265 years, or from 1243 to 1508. Some of them may be mere compilers, but I do not so understand the matter. A second list, comprising the names of thirty-three more travellers visiting Central Asia between 1558 and 1684, shows nearly half the number to have been Englishmen * At the close of the seventeenth and commence ment of the eighteenth century, Russia, under Peter the Great, sent out her explorers to penetrate into the same regions from the north and west. Peter wished to establish commercial intercourse with India; but the independent Khanates beyond * See ante, p. 15.( 30 ) the Steppes were not quite prepared to encourage so civilized an object by giving free passage to com merce through their territories. He, however, when able to turn his attention from the Swedes and Turks, entered into some sort of correspondence with Khiva; for it is urged on behalf of Russia, that so far back as 1703, the Czar received the Khan's allegiance, at a time when the latter was sorely pressed by the Amir of Bokhara; and from 1714 to 1717 efforts were made to establish Russian authority on the eastern shores of the Caspian, and generally in Tur- kistan. Accounts of two expeditions with this object in view are given in the 'Journal of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society' for 1853. One was despatched from Siberia under Colonel Bucholz, and one from Astrakhan under Prince Bekovich. But although Peter the Great continued to push forward his scheme of intercourse with India, and for this purpose sought to make a ready road through Bokhara and intervening countries, no positive mea sure of occupation or annexation in Central Asia seems to have been carried out until after that monarch's death, in 1725. He had, by his own pre sence and that of a numerous army, made the tribes on the seaside of the Kharazm desert accustomed to personal contact with the Europeans or semi-Euro peans north of the Steppes and the Caspian ; but by treaty with Persia he had abandoned claim to posses sion of any tracts east of the latter. In 1732, however.( 31 ) the Khan of the Lesser Horde of Kirgiz was formally received under Russian protection, and a consider able extent of country came under Russian organiza tion and supervision. ' Dating from this time,' says General Perovski, ' civil order was gradually introduced into the depths of Central Asia. In 1822 a series of regulations were promulgated for the Government of the Kir- gizes, who wandered in the Irtish Ishim Steppe, and from 1834 they are under the jurisdiction of local courts. In 1834 the Alexandrevski fortifica tion was erected near Kaidak, a bay of the Caspian. In 1846 the fortresses of Orenburg and Uralsk were founded in the heart ot the Steppe, on the rivers Irgiz and Tuegai respectively. In 1847 Fort Raimsk was erected near the mouth of the Sir Daria, and on the reduction of Ak Mashhad in 1853, the Russians established themselves along the whole of this river.' In 1854, the writer himself proceeded on a second expedition to Khiva, accepted the nominal submission of the Khan, Muhamad Amin, at the city itself, and returned. From General Perovski let us now turn to Roma- novski, one of the principal actors in the drama of conquest and annexation, which appears to have reached a new phase in the departure of the expedi tion to Khiva now attracting public attention at home. He states that in 1854, or at the outset ol the Crimean war, it was resolved by a Special Com-( 32 ) mittee, and confirmed by the Emperor Nicholas, to connect the then newly-established Sir Daria line with the newlj'-advanced Siberian line of frontier. This was considered to be the best measure to secure the object of the advance into the Steppes, made already by the force of circumstances. The question is too wide a one to admit of present description and illustration. It would carry us into China and Russian progress China-ward, a subject which, though thrown out of this night's consideration, is of very great interest and importance. We are, how ever, concerned to know that between the years 1850 and 1860 the Russian detached posts, forts, and military settlements were ' scattered over the vast surface of the Steppes, on the one side from the Ural and Irtish to the-north-eastern part of the Caspian as far as the northern parts of the Sea of Aral and Sir Daria; and on the other as far as the Hi River at the base of the Tian Shan Mountains.' The Mangishlak Peninsula on the west. Fort Perov- ski on the Sir Daria, and the Hi River west of Kulja, will exhibit the supposed limit as nearly as possible on the 44th parallel of latitude. In spite of endeavouring to consolidate without further extension, and of keeping on the best terms with the rulers and people of the Khanates of Central Asia, the Russians complained that their relations south of the Steppes were far from satis factory. Khiva and Kokhand were usually hostile,( 33 ) and Bokhara was not so friendly as she might be. A flotilla on the Sea of Aral, and other moves, offen sive or defensive, kept the Khivans from open warfare, but Khokand not only refused to make concessions to the northern intruders, but became their assailants within the limits occupied. The connection of the Orenburg and Siberian lines was looked upon as the fittest remedial measure. Roma- novsky informs us that, ' while accepting this decision, which must have inevitably led one way or another to the subjection of Khokand, Bokhara, and Khiva to our influence, the Russian Govern ment was far from entertaining any ambitious views.' In accordance, then, with the approved scheme, Russian troops took possession of the trans-lli region, built forts Yernoe and Kastik, north of the Issik Lake and Ala Tau mountains; destroyed the Kokhand forts of Pishpek and Tokmak, and, later, captured that of Yani Kurgan; and carried on several - important local military surveys, with a view, if necessary, to further operations. These were occurrences of the years between 1854 and 1864. Then began the work of actually connect ing the two Russian frontiers. A line was first proposed to be drawn from about Fort Yernoe east to Anlia Ata, the small Kara Tan range, and Julek in the west; but this plan being overruled, an advanced line was substituted, comprising Shem- d( 34 ) kand. To put the new proposal into execution, it became necessary to take forcible possession of Aulia Ata, the town of Turkistan, and Shemkand. Troops were, therefore, again put in requisition, and the end achieved. The despatches mention that at Aulia Ata the enemy's loss was not known, but that the inhabitants buried 307 bodies, and there were 390 wounded Khokandians; the Russians themselves having only three men slightly wounded, and one officer and one man bruised. On the two other occasions the Russians lost, in all, one officer and ten men killed; but there is no mention made of casualties on the other side. The immediate consequence of these strong measures was the publication of a circular mani festo addressed to the Embassies and Legations of H.I. Majesty at foreign courts, and couched in the most conciliatory and moderate language, explain ing how the force of circumstances rather than the exercise of free will had brought about the results above described, and the formation of a new province aptly designated Russian Turkistan. I will not attempt any long or detailed account of subsequent operations. A glance at the map will show that the line taken up and declared eight years ago has been further extended to the south, and, to repeat Captain Trench's appropriate expres sion, a ' wedge ' driven in, which, whatever its nature or purport, can hardly imply permanence or( 35 ) anything but disquiet and disorder. Snflice it to summarize the main facts. After the formation of Russian Turkistan, the Bokhara and Khokand Uzbeks resumed their nor mal state of internecine strife. General Chernaiev, commanding Russian troops, and watching proceed ings from Shemkand, sent out a ' corps d'observa- tion ' towards Tashkand, and this detachment was attacked by Khokandians ; whereupon the Russians faced and defeated their assailants, and en revanche stormed and captured their fort of Niaz Beg. This led to further reprisals, and finally the capture of the city of Tashkand. The Bokharians demanded evacuation of the place by Chernaiev, and on the General's refusal to comply with the demand, stopped a Russian karavan, and imprisoned the merchants who composed it. After further mea sures of retaliation on either side, the contending parties arrived at a quasi-friendly understanding, and a scientific and diplomatic mission was sent by Russia to Bokhara. The Amir, however, when he had given the delegates a fair reception, reverted to the normal treachery of his race, and forcibly detained them. Chernaiev marched out of Tash kand with a force, intending to move on Bokhara; but he was delayed at Jazak, west of Samarkand, attacked, and compelled to retreat to the Sir River. These events occasioned this General's recall from Saint Petersburg, and the appointment of General d 2( 36 ) Romanovsky as his successor, who reached lasli- kand in March, 1866. The new Commander-in-Chief and Military Governor in Russian Turkistan, under the Governor- General of Orenburg, did not long remain quiet at his post. He had been sent out, apparently, to act as much as possible in a conciliatory spirit, but was evidently not hampered by inexpedient restrictions. The water communication established on the Sii River enabled steamers to ascend from Fort Perovsky to Chinaz below Tashkand, so that the new position occupied was not without natural advantages in regions so remote from the civilized world as the Tartar Khanates. This facility of transport was turned to account, and Romanovsky soon found himself actively engaged with the Bokharians, not withstanding the smooth speeches with which he was greeted by them. Marching out of Fort Chinaz to an entrenched camp defended by their artilleiy at Irjar, he stormed and carried their works, and routed them with great slaughter. A few days later he took the fortified and populous city ot Khqjand, after a week's investment and bombard ment; thus severing, as it were, Kokhand from Bokhara,—this place being intermediate to the two. These operations were succeeded by a lull; the Russian delegates were released and returned, but there was no sign of settled peace. Nor could there well be under the circumstances:( 37 ) for Russia took Khokandian towns and forts claimed by Bokhara, and Bokhara felt* the blow to be one levelled at her own power in Central Asia. That this state of things gave rise to internal revolutions cannot be held surprising. An outcry was raised against the ill-starred Amir by the Mullahs, or priest hood, and others, and the standard of rebellion was raised by a bold and ambitious chief. General Romanovsky had been replaced in Russian Tur- kistan by General Kauffman, its Military Governor, 1 believe, at the present hour; and the question of administering the newly-acquired province, 'as well as policy to be pursued with the neighbouring chiefs and people, engaged the serious attention of the higher authorities. General Kauffman entered into negotiations with the Amir of Bokhara; but the excitement of his subjects against the latter was such, that before a treaty could be signed, a holy war was proclaimed, and the neighbouring Khans of Khiva and Khokand called on to join the Bokharians. It was clear, however, that nothing but a decisive victory could produce an efficient alliance against the common enemy, and Kauffman shattered their hopes of unanimity and success by adding Samarkand to the list of captured cities. Perhaps no place in the whole of Central Asia had been more universally lauded and esteemed than this. It liad become a sort of by-word to the Oriental for all that was( 38 ) poetical and luxurious in life, and, even in its com paratively fallen state, was, theoretically, to the Uzbek what Baghdad is to the Arab, and Shiraz to the Persian. Finally, to the capture of Samarkand succeeded that of Kette Kurgan, one of the strongest of Bokhara forts, together with a series of sharp decisive actions in which Generals Kauffman and Abramoff contrived to rout their ill-disciplined opponents. The Amir of Bokhara, driven to ex tremities, made peace with his conquerors, who consummated the act by assisting him to quell rebellion, and restoring to him the town of Karshi which they had taken, on his behalf, from the rebels, one being his own son. According to Cap tain Trench, in his careful digest of the 'Russo- Indian Question,' Saiad Muzafar, the reigning Amir of Bokhara at the particular period referred to, ' sent envoys to General AbramofF with presents, to express his gratitude for the services he had ren dered him.' If we are to accept without reserve the significant paper forwarded to ' The Times' from its Persian correspondent on the 16th November last year, a treaty of mutual obligations was signed by Adjutant- General KaufFman on the part of Russia on the 29th January, 1868, and by Khuda Yar Khan, ruler of Khokand, on the 13th February following, by which Russian merchants and Russian merchan-( 39 ) dise were to be treated with marked favour. In like manner a treaty of commerce most advan tageous to Russian commerce, and guaranteeing protection to Russian subjects, was accepted by Sdiad Muzafar, Amir of Bokhara, after a second cession of a captured town was made to him in 1870. Of the Khan of Khokand the writer in the 4 Official Gazette' says, that he ' being our nearest neighbour, was the first to realize the impossibility of military resistance.' As to the Amir of Bokhara, he 'had convinced himself that we wished to live with him in peace and amity, and had no desire to extend our possessions at his expense.' In respect of Khiva, the paper says, 44 All our attempts to establish friendly intercourse with that Khanate came to nothing, and, indeed, only served to open our eyes to the hostile dispositions ol the Khiva Government. Yet all we asked for was that the Russian subjects detained as prisoners at Khiva should be set at liberty, that our traders should have free access to the Khanate, and that they should be protected while there. These, our just and moderate demands, were either left altogether unanswered, or on other occasions declined, or made the pretext for raising absurd pretensions. Matters cannot possibly remain in this state ; the less so as the maintenance of order and quiet in our Orenburg Steppes is altogether dependent on our relations with Khiva.'( 40 ) The latest intelligence that we now possess is to the effect that three Russian columns are to march upon Khiva, one from Orenburg in the north, one from the Caspian, and one probably from the east ward or some part of Russian Turkistan. The most frequented and best known routes, and the most easily traversed and shortest, are those taking a north-easterly direction from the Caspian, on the eastern shores of which are Russian forts or depots at Tiuk Karagan, Bekter Liman, Krasnavodsky, Mulla Kari, and the little Balkan at Chikishlar, occupied so late as November, 1871; and down to the extreme angle of the coast at Ashurada in the Bay of Astrabad. The two last-named posts must be held especially important, as they command the mouths of the Atrak and Gurgan rivers, whence pass the mountain chains and valleys marking the Northern frontier of Persia, and opening out a ready road to the east and south-east, wholly independent of, and unconnected with, the mountainous districts of the Oxus-sources which have recently engaged the attention of geographers and politicians at home. PERSIA. Persia and Afghanistan are both, as it were, geographically shut out of the Central Asian belt represented by the Independent Khanates and Chinese Tartary; but many geographers would, L believe, be content to admit them as essential and legitimate parts of Central Asia. What I have to( 41 ) say of the former has either originated or been confirmed by personal experience. Of the latter, I can speak from a tolerably long acquaintance with its people, and a recent journey into one of its western districts. I need not tell you how old a country is Persia, how powerful and extensive she was in the days of Ahasuerus, who reigned five centuries before the Christian era, ' from India even unto Ethiopia, oven an hundred and seven and twenty provinces;' how great at the Macedonian conquest. We must be careful not to compare the ' Persia,' distinguished in ancient days as a mere province like the neigh bouring Media, Carmania, and Susiana^ with the great Empire which bore that name, has borne it from time immemorial, and bears it at this hour.* Even under her Muhamadan rulers she has attained, at times, a reputation of which Turkey in its palmy days might be envious; but her splendour at such periods has been rather in flashes; and to the ' came, saw, conquered' of her modern warrior kings might with equal propriety be added the words ' and lost again.' Persia has of late years been striving to recover something of the outlying regions she has held under her monarchs of the Safavian dynasty, who reigned from a.d , 1478 to 1722. But only the East has * For the student of geography and ethnology it is hardly necessary to refer to the valuable and comprehensive notes to Pro lessor hawlinson s ' Herodotus,' as the source of full information on those heads.( 42 ) been open to her encroachments; and the great moral roller of annexation set going by her Govern ment has been therefore confined in its movements to one particular quarter, the Afghan and Baluch frontiers. This, you will observe, is precisely the same direction as that towards which Russia is approaching from the far North, and its terminus, irrespective of China and the far East, is British India. On the West, Persia has a neighbour who, even if not sufficiently strong to resist her armies, can shelter herself under the aegis of civilized mediation. But Turkey is the stronger of the two, and is, moreover, careful of having a strong Govern ment on her Asiatic frontiers. On the South, there is the sea, that most effectual of all barriers to Oriental aggression, except where there is a fleet, a requirement barely in accordance with the genius of the Persian people. On the North, as we have shown, there is Russia, and Russia's move to the Atrak River sets a bar to the extension of her weaker neighbour's territory in that direction. Yet it is not much more than one hundred years ago that the Persian Empire extended to the Oxus. Well might Purchas be supposed to have in view the modern conquerors of Turkistan when he wrote in the dawn of the seventeenth century:—' I know not how Divine Providence seemeth to have set those Scythian stints to the Persian proceedings; those great monarches, both in the elder, and our( 43 ) later world, ever finding those Northern windes crossing, and in some dismall successe prohibiting their ambition that way.' * Before the famine of the last two years, Persia was estimated to possess a population under five millions. Of these a fifth were supposed to be the inhabitants of large towns or cities, and nearly two- fifths were Turks, Arabs, Kurds, and other members of nomad tribes. The most populous city is Tabriz, in the West; next in order are Tehran, Ispahan, .and Mashhad; none are, according to the returns, equal in numbers to Hull or even Portsmouth. The extent of the whole country is about 700 miles from north to south, with 900 from east to west, and the small proportion of seven inhabitants to the square mile has been considered a correct representa tion. Some large tracts of Eastern Baluchistan, found to have been possessed by Persia within the last few years, may need inclusion in this rough estimate; but on the other hand, the famine must have sorely diminished the numbers of the sparse population. I have myself travelled over the country in nearly every direction during the last eight or nine years. In 1865 I landed at Enzeli in the south-west of the Caspian, and proceeded, vid Resht and Kazvin, to Tehran, the capital. Thence, after a delay of four months on duty, I moved on to Ispahan, and turning * His ' Pilgrimage,' p. 401.( 44 ) eastward to Yezd and Kirman, continued my route to the sea-coast through Baluchistan. From Enzeli, on the Caspian to Charbar, the small fishing village then reached, the distance may be roughly computed at 1520 miles. Of this I performed 450 post, or ' chapar,' as it is called, 840 by marching stages on my own horses, and 230 on a camel. The posting is exciting, and not unpleasant for a day or two, but becomes irksome without a companion or some strong incentive to progress. Much, however, depends on the horse; for it may be quite as wearying to ride 20 miles on an expended animal as four times the distance on four decent roadsters. You divide your luggage with your servant, and may further dispose of a pair of well-packed saddle-bags by using the back of a third horse belonging to the post-horse groom. Any distance between 60 and 100 miles a day may be reckoned fair ' chaparing.' I will not describe the mysteries of camel driving. Once on the back of the animal, and risen with him, you have his nose-rope put into your hands, and you soon discover what to do with it. In 1867, I landed at Poti, on the Mingrelian coast of the Black Sea, arid finding my way, in a troika, or open cart, drawn by three horses, to Kutais, and thence, in a tarantasse, or springless carriage, to Tiflis and the Persian frontier on the Arras, I took post-horses again from the latter point to Tehran. Thence, alter a delay of more than( 45 ) three months at the capital, broken by a ride to Hamadan (Ecbatana) and back, I posted to Bagh dad, in Turkish Arabia, and proceeded from that city by water to Bombay. The total of the land journey thus performed, including the Hamadan visit, was 1740 miles, the whole of which (400 odd miles of Caucasian jolting excepted) was by horse-post. In 1870, I again passed through Persia, from the Caspian to the Makran coast, reaching the sea on this occasion at Grwadar, a port about 80 miles east of Charbar, whither I had marched some years before by land from Karachi, in Sind. 1 returned by sea to Bushire, in the Persian Gulf, and from Bushire to Tehran and Enzeli, having performed altogether a land journey of more than 2000 miles. And in 1871-2, I made the journey from Bandar Abbas, at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, to the Afghan frontier in Sistan, thence moving to Mash- had in Khorasan, thence to Tehran, and again to Enzeli on the Caspian, a further distance of more than 2000 miles. On the two last occasions I marched with fellow- countrymen, with excellent Persian servants, and for three-quarters of the way with tents and pur chased horses, leading an out-door life of the healthiest kind, save at the setting in of the hot season, and one or two exceptional changes ol weather and temperature. Ii I rejoiced more than( 46 ) my neighbours at exchanging the vicissitudes of Persian travel for Russian steamers and Russian railways, it may be that there was more mental holiday in the one than the other. I mention these somewhat egotistical facts not with the irrelevant object of showing the amount of mileage performed in so many hours, but to explain how I have become personally acquainted with Central Asia, or at least its outlying regions to the south-west, and what opportunities I have had of personally studying the character of the people. Were it a question of riding long distances in short spaces of time, or traversing and retraversing certain sections of Persia, I could not pretend to achieve ments such as performed by my younger associates, the officers of the Persian telegraph. To summarize my own impressions of Persia as ( a country, and its inhabitants as a people, I must ask you to suppose a high land of the extent already stated, dropping to the Caspian Sea for nearly one- third of its northern frontier, and to the Persian Gulf in illustration of its southern limit. The low lands naturally are the tracts near the sea-coast. In the north they are covered with forest, and the climate there is damp, feverish, relaxing; in the south they are dry and barren, and the winds are hot and violent, yet a relief to the scorching summer atmosphere. In the central high lands (and Persia generally may be understood in this division) there( 47 ) are few rivers, and the country is either composed of parallel mountain ranges and broad intervening plains, or of irregular mountain masses with fertile valleys, basins, and ravines. For irrigation the plains and valleys depend on the mountains, and at the base of these are ' kanats,' or underground canals, which, with watercourses on the surface, are scattered throughout the land. Yet where rain and snow fail during the year, there is scarcity of water; and where both are wanting there is distress. The valleys and ravines are more fertile than the plains, affording often bright, picturesque, and grateful prospects, while the latter are for the most part barren and sandy wastes, scored or streaked, as it were, rather than ornamented, with patches of green oases. Forests are rare, and not dense; nume rous gardens are commonly found in the neighbour hood of large towns, not cared for as with us, yet pleasant in their wildness; and there are many beautiful trees usually also near the centres of population. Cities are not such as we should sup pose them, estimating from experience in Europe. The passing stranger sees no street in any of them at all comparable to a respectable street or building, as England, France, or G-ermany rate structural respectability. Blank mud walls and narrow, ill- paved thoroughfares are the rule; the windowed or terraced front of a Persian house is for the inner court or inner precincts of the abode, and not for( 48 ) the world without. Some mosques are handsome, some karavanserais solid, some bazars highly credit able to the designer and builder; but everything is irregular, nothing is permanent, and architectural ruin blends with architectural revival in the midst of dirt, discomfort, and a total disregard of municipal method. Even Constantinople and Cairo cannot bear the ordeal of close inspection. Beautiful and attractive as they may be from without—and the first has a charm beyond description—they are palpably deficient in completeness within; and yet Tehran, Baghdad, Ispahan, Tabriz, Mashhad, Shiraz, these are far behind them in civilized construction and order. As for the people, their physique is intrinsically fine, but seldom fairly developed. As a rule, the rich and middle classes, despite of abili ties and reasoning power, ruin their constitutions by sensuality and dissipation; while the poorer and working classes, with less power of reasoning, but healthier tastes and habits, have barely sufficient sustenance to give nature fair play. The crown implies despotism ; but the Shah, or sovereign of the day, though wayward and capri cious enough to do startling acts, is rather cautious than otherwise in the free exercise of his power. The government of the land, if composed of men of the old school, and pursuing its way after the fashion of bygone years, admitting the corrupt and venal practices of its predecessors, is strong,( 4!) ) because it is known to the country and outlying provinces, and because it rules in accordance with custom of time immemorial. If composed of new men, as at present, and ruling more or less abnor mally, it grasps at civilization as at something it seeks to appropriate as well as appreciate; but is better known to the foreign Legations at head quarters than through the length and breadth of the land. Under no circumstances can the few favoured individuals forming a Ministry be held to represent the Persian people and Persian nation. These have reallj^ no representatives west of Oriental Russia and Turkey; and hence the national feeling towards foreigners entertained in Persia, as a kingdom, can only be partially known to our side of Europe. England has for many years been on intimate rela tions with her, irrespectively of a little war and an occasional rupture; first in pursuance of our policy towards the first Napoleon, secondly in our endea vour to check Russian encroachment eastward. I am not prepared to say what has l^en substantially gained in either case, but times have changed suffi ciently to cancel the old programme. France is no longer a rival in the sense of hostility, while with Russia we negotiate on her Central Asian move ments in the most unreserved and friendly manner. At the present day there are Legations from England, Russia, France, and Turkey, at the Shah's Court, and Persia sends her envoys to these four e( . r '&lt;&gt; ) Courts In return. Austria is to be added to the list. Jt is the policy of the existing Government in Persia to be on good terras with all, and the reigning monarch gives no sign of individual reluctance in accepting the arrangement. T have spoken of the Ministers at the capital. To these should be added the governors of provinces, men who in some cases have won their position by money and influence, in some cases by money alone, for the boon is to the highest bidder. Then there is the priesthood, bigoted and intolerant as a body, but with notable excep tions among individual members. The array is fairly numerous, but poorly organized, boasting excellent material, but insufficiently fostered and developed. Persia is without a fleet, but she has a maritime and chiefly alien population whence sailors might readily be drawn. Such then, in few words, is Persia,—a country rising, perhaps, in political importance in relation to Europe, but effete as regards her ancient Asiatic prestige. Had there been time we might have travelled over a great part of her dominions this evening. As there is none to spare, I will content myself with glancing at a passage of my recent diaries of travel bearing upon the Turkomans, a people in every sense belonging to Central Asia, and par excellence to Khiva. They are divided into nine 'Khalk,' or people, au Arabic word used in Baluchistan down to the( 51 ) sea-coast. Of these nine divisions the Yamut, the (xoklan, and the Tekke inhabit, or rather overrun, the northern frontiers of Persia, or from the Caspian eastwards, a line generally indicated by the Atrak and Gurgan rivers, the chain of mountains north of Mashhad, and town of Sarrakhs. All organized marauders, mainly plundering with a view to human spoil, while the 'beats' of the Yamut and Goklan are the lower eastern shores of the Caspian and valley of the Gurgan respectively, the Tekke moves down from Merv and its neighbourhood into Khorasan and Kaian. Their 'chapaos,' or assaults, are sudden and on open ground, so that flight with out dismounting is always practicable. The horses are marvellously swift, and bear away captives as well as captors without strain or effort. In coming up from Sistan, last year, to Mashhad, 1 heard many reports of local raids; and at a place called ' Seh Deh,' or the three villages, north of Birjand, the capital of the Kaian district, we were informed that fifty persons had just been carried off from the vicinity by Turkoman robbers. The next day we fell in with a poor dumb vagrant who signi fied to us by wild pantomimic gestures that he had lost all but life and liberty at their hands. And, indeed, for 2G0 miles, or from the town of Kaian to Mashhad, and for 200 miles from Mashhad to Shahrud, below the south-easternmost shores of the Caspian, 550 miles in all, only seven marches, or( 52 ) 1G0 odd miles, could be considered free from Turko man invasion; and we had to be provided with escorts of cavalry, infantry, and at times, even artillery—for we had a real field-piece and the recognized complement of gunners—to accomplish this part of our journey. With the exception of the irregular footmen, whose appearance was decidedly incompatible with either spectacle or strategy, we had no cause to be dissatisfied with our soldiers. An amusing instance of what duties are assigned and what orders imparted to some of the ' sarbaz,' or regulars, in Persia, may here be cited. I had crept out of a small bell-tent one night, and was returning thither to sleep, preparatory to an early morning march, when my attention was arrested by observing the Persian sentry standing with sword ported, watching my movements. The arrangement, whatever it was, had clearly been made for my special benefit; but as I did not require such immediate surveillance, I thought I would dispense with his services. My friend dared not go ; he was under orders. There was no need, however, for distress on his account. That he was not really designed for heavy night duty was ap parent from his naive reply to my further question ing as to the exact nature of his instructions. ' Sir, the ' Yawar' (Major) ordered me to remain only till you were asleep. Then, I was to proceed to my quarters.'( 53 ) Well, we passed through the Turkoman-infested tracts without meeting the enemy, but experience of the country served to convince me of its wretched condition, subject to inroads of so disastrous a nature as those described. It would be well if the Persian Government could stamp out the evil. Russia will probably do so on her side; she has already com menced with the Yamuts on the shores of the Caspian; and a combined movement could hardly fail of success. Whatever may be the true motives and designs of Russia, she can hardly fail to com mand some sympathy from European States in releasing her own subjects from slavery in Khiva or elsewhere, and preventing a traffic in human beings from being carried on with impunity in the west of Central Asia. AFGHANISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN. There now remain Afghanistan and Baluchistan, to complete our survey of the regions between Europe and British India. As parts of Central Asia they hardly demand a detailed examination. Our geographies inform us that Afghanistan is bounded on the north by Turkistan, east by Hin dustan, south by Baluchistan, and west by Persia; that in the direction of east and west it stretches over 500, and north and south over between 400 and 450 miles; that a large portion consists oi alternate rocks, mountains, and deserts; that its rivers partake( 54 of the nature of torrents, being nearly all fordable during the greater part of the year, but that the Kabul, Helmand, and Farah are noble streams; that its climate is, in the higher lands, very cold, and in the plains intensely hot, though from its general elevation it is colder than Western Asia, and much colder than Southern Asia. The area is estimated at 220,000 square miles ; but these figures must have undergone a considerable change during the revolutions of recent years. Especially notable, as its geographical features, are the mountains belong ing to the Hindu Kush system in the north and north-east, the high Suliman range dividing it from India on the east, and the valleys and mountains on the south near the Kelat border. The origin of the Afghans is a moot point, and involves an inquiry of much ethnological interest. What affinity, if any, they bear to the Arians and Arachosians, whose territories they occupy, or whether they are all or for the most part settlers brought in by conquest or circumstances, we cannot now discuss. Before the successful invasion of Persia in 1722, their nation had been, according to an author of the period, ' unknown to Europe, and scarce known to Asia, where it lies in a corner.'* When they had overthrown an illustrious dynasty of Persian kings they became suddenly notorious ; but ,,, Father Krusinsky, translated by Father Du Cercean, * History of the late Revolutions of Persia,' 2nd Edition. London, 1733.( 55 ) their notoriety had no permanent honour. In a very few years, and after two short incomplete reigns, they were found incompetent to perform the task taken in hand, and hurled back ingloriously to their own country. Their tribes are numerous, and tribe dis tinctions kept up with scrupulous care. A wild, warlike people brought up in an atmosphere of deceit and suspicion, it is difficult to surmise what subjects they would prove under a civilized Govern ment; but for my own part I should certainly prefer the Persians as soldiers or servants, and as companions. Afghanistan, as a consolidated kingdom, dates only from about 125 years ago, when it was founded by Ahmad Shah, Abdali. This chief, taking occa sion to break off allegiance to Persia, on the death of his acknowledged sovereign. Nadir Shah, and failing to influence the succession in that country, retired to Kandahar with his numerous followers, and constituted that city the capital of a new State, comprising also within its limits Kabul and Herat. He died after a glorious reign of twenty-five years, remarkable for several invasions of India, the last of which might have given him the throne of Delhi, had his ambition so willed. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Taimur, who transferred his capital from Kandahar to Kabul, and reigned twenty years. On Taimur's death in 1793, his third son. Shah Zaman, became king, but his own weakness and the turbu- *( 56 ) lent rivalry ol' his brothers caused internal revolu tion, the fall of the dynasty, and eventually the splitting up of the consolidated kingdom into chiet- doms, of which Kabul, Kandahar, and Herat, were the most important, the last being at one time quite independent of the other two.* For a long series of years the country was a prey to family feuds and party rebellions; and in 1839 British troops crossed the frontier to support a certain candidate to power. That step was preg nant with disaster, and although the massacre of our troops at Kabul was avenged by an after expedition of no common repute, it must be generally admitted that the prestige of England suffered, at least for a time, from the nature of her interference in the affairs of her Asiatic neighbour. At present the political horizon looks brighter, and Afghanistan turns towards our rulers with an evident increase of confidence. There is now, moreover, under the auspices of the Amir Shir Ali Khan, an appearance of territorial consolidation; and should the latest policy of the Indian Government prove successful, an Afghan monarchy may be revived, if not equal in splendour, at least superior in civilization, to that of Ahmad Shah. The late Sir Henry Pottinger, who travelled in * Appendix to ' Historical Memoir on Shikarpur,'printed in Part II. * Miscellaneous Information on the Province of Sind.'—Bombay Govern ment Records, No. VII., New Series.( 57 ) Baluchistan in 1810, was for nearly half a century the great, almost the only, authority on that country; but within the last ten or fifteen years it has been opened out by more recent explorers. Shortly before Pottinger wrote, the country was under the rule of a single powerful chief, a nominal tributary to the Afghan king, as he once had been to Persia ; but in the hands of his son and successor the despot ism gradually waned; many petty chiefs threw off allegiance, and the confederacy, which had been a strong one so long as its component parts were held firmly together, fell to pieces when the grip relaxed, and the master influence was gone. The boundaries of Baluchistan may still be considered to be Af ghanistan north, the sea south, India and Persia east and west respectively, and the whole area not less than 1G0,000 square miles; but a line must be run down the centre to mark off the later acquisi tions of Persia; and to find the country which still belongs to the Brahui Khan of to-day, we must look east of the meridian 02°, instead of 58°, accord ing to the position given by all except the newest maps. This last-mentioned territory touches our Indian frontier from the plains above Shikarpur in Sind, along the mountain ranges called Hala, to the sea west of Karachi. It is in parts very mountainous, in parts very desert. The maritime tracts between Karachi and the Persian frontier include the country( 58 ) of the ' Ichthyophagoi,' and the modern name Makran bears a strange similarity to the Persian word ' Mahi-khoran,' a literal translation of the Greek plural word.* Having myself passed over the utmost length of Makran in the course of duty, entering it twice from the Persian, and once from the Indian, side, I have no hesitation in pronouncing it to be one of the most desolate and arid of regions. As a rule, the coast is a flat sandy waste; but here and there the inland chains of mountains throw out a spur towards the sea, and a few abrupt cliffs, laved by the salt waters, block up the traveller's path, and drive him to the interior. There are no less than twenty- seven ' khors,' or mouths of temporary rivers, which come down suddenly after rain, and disappear as rapidly as they rise. The people of the country are divided by Pottin- gerf into two great classes, Brahui and Baluchi, between which he finds there is no affinity of lan guage or physique. Kelat, the ruling chiefdom in Eastern Baluchistan, or that half which is not under Persian supremacy, is peopled mostly by Brahuis. Like its larger and more important neighbour Afghanistan, although it has been through a phase of hostility towards us, its ruler and people are now our allies, and its relative position to British India * 'Brief History of Kelat,' by Major Leech, in Asiatic Society's Journal, 1843. t ' Travels in Baluchistan and Sinde,' Longman, 1816.( 59 ) may reasonably place it in the category ol protected States. Having thus taken a cursory glance at the coun tries below that Central Asian belt which may be comprised in the designation of ' Turkistan, as well as at the Khanates, which it would be mockery to characterize any longer as ' Independent,' 1 will endeavour to impart a practical meaning to our inquiries by bringing before you two or three of the more prominent routes to India irom Khiva, Bok hara, and Khokand. From Khiva, whatever way we proceed, the dis tance is great for a large moving body. The route through Herat, Kandahar, and Quetta would, perhaps, be the shortest and best; but it lies through Afghani stan and Kelat, and only with the active assistance of those States could it be accomplished. From Astrabad, at the south-east corner of the Caspian, to Karachi, there are roads through Sistan, and thence not only by Kandahar, but by Eastern Baluchistan. These might be made available if Persia chose to make them so, as she has done for her own troops; not otherwise. She can bring her soldiers to Peshin in the Kej valley, within 400 miles of Karachi; but the distance from the Caspian would exceed 2000 miles, and many marches are in a complete desert. From Bokhara and Khokand there aie loads through Kabul, or Kashgar in the far east. I he( 60 ) first would necessitate a continuance by the Khaibar Pass to Peshawar, or by the Bolan Pass to Shikar- pur. The difficulties of the Khaibar have been proved by our own troops; they would be great for any troops, except these had a common cause and object with the mountain tribes around ; and if such contingency were to arise, there might be left to the new-comers a choice of passes. The Bolan is not new to us, and is one much used by our Kabul and Bokhara-going Indian merchants. The second, or Kashgar road, is now engaging marked attention in a commercial rather than strategical point of view; and whether communications to that town and to Yarkand be carried on through the Pamir high lands, or through Leh, or both, in either case over immense elevations, must remain a question for the future to decide. On commencing the present paper, I had pur posed to seek, in contradistinction to the political and general geography of Central Asia, a separate argument, as it were, in the Central Asian Question. But even had your patience not been tried by a longer exposition, under the former head, than originally contemplated, I think that an understand ing on the position and character of the States between Europe and British India will suffice to remove all doubt as to the nature of the question thence arising. If Russia ask herself what is her next move, and whither do her conquests tend.( 61 ) England may, with equal propriety, ask how the late Russian moves should afreet her present poliey, and how may the coming moves affect the future peace and security of her Indian empire ? Each of these is literally a ' question.' The two together, and, it may be, many more ambigui ties combined, make up the general question. So far as England has moved in the matter, she has drawn out a line of frontier north of Afghani stan, which Eussia has agreed to respect. This frontier takes within the territories of the Amir Shir Ali,— 1st, Badakhshan and Wakhan, from the Sari Kul on the east, to the junctions of the Gokcha and Oxus. 2nd, Kunduz, Khulm, and Balkh, defined by the line of the Oxus prolonged to Khojah Saleh on the Bokhara road. 3rd, The districts of Akcha, Saripul, Mainianeh, Shibberghan, and Andkuhi, defined by a line abandoning the left bank of the Oxus, and taking a south-westerly direction till it joins the already recognized Perso-Afghan frontier west of Herat. And she has, by her officers employed during the last two years and a half, drawn out a line of demarcation between Persia and Afghanistan, in continuation of the Herat frontier line, as also a line of demarcation between Persia and Kelat, for future understanding of boundaries in Baluchistan; which two settlements should supply one continuous( 62 ) # line of frontier for Eastern Persia from Herat to the sea. These measures, like all public measures, are open to diseussion, and the question of their expe diency or otherwise is also further illustrative of what is popularly called the ' Central Asian Question.' In conclusion, I will venture to add a short remark about travel, and a shorter one about diplomacy. There may not, improbably, be present here both travellers and diplomatists of the future ; and if there be, there is just a chance that what I have to say may not be quite valueless to, or quite unremehibered by them. To many minds there is something very attrac tive in travel; and if we only possess a natural spirit of inquiry and a body unafflicted by ache or disease, the more we travel in early years, the more does the taste grow upon us. The cases are, more over, not few in which the physical sufferer derives benefit from change of air and scene, even when obtained at the cost of a long journey from home. But I think it will be admitted that more people travel from necessity or for pastime than to add to the knowledge of the mass, and a great many of those do not even take the trouble to jot down their experiences except for the commonplace purpose of personal gain or personal satisfaction. Doubtless, that many a traveller, mute and inglorious so far as( 63 ) posterity and the world are concerned, would have given to the public a book, or at least a pamphlet or magazine article, had he been pressed by a pub lisher, or judiciously goaded by a Mend; but then, again, why should publishers press for manuscripts except where pecuniary profit is clear ? and as for friends, how few there are whose judgment in these cases is unimpeachable! My own travel has been mainly a work of necessity ; but its experience has in a great degree warranted me in urging travel upon others as a means of combining knowledge and amusement; the first to be stored in memon and a note-book, for the use of those whom it is likely to benefit most, the second as a preventive of sickness of mind and body, and a healthy stimu lant to the worthy use of time. As for ' Diplomacy ' I fear the word is often misunderstood both at home and abroad, and tians- lated somewhat metaphorically as double-dealing, instead of in its more literal and professional sense. Surely this interpretation should be rejected in the nineteenth century in every quarter of the globe! A great deal has been often said ol the training required for this profession, and especially for dealing with Orientals. Knowledge of the language is, of course, useful, in the East, and knowledge of men and manners, everywhere; but beyond this, I think the training of an English gentleman supplies the best and highest diploma for qualilica-( 64 ) lion to treat with foreigners as with one's own countrymen. And the more astute or cunning our opponent, the more dangerous and treacherous his fencing—the better foil in our hands is Honesty. Tact is invaluable, but its use need not be deroga tory. It may sound like a platitude but I believe it an important truth, that the highest diplomatic tact is that which makes success the result of untiring and uncompromising straightforwardness, whether exercised in the salons of civilized Europe, or on the sandy wastes of Khiva and Khorasan. FINIS, LONDON: PRINTED by EDWABD STANFORD, 6 AKD 7. CHAKING CROSS.( JAMAICA ^ and ITS GOVERNOR DURING THE LAST SIX YEARS. BY A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY. LONDON: EDWARD STANFORD, 0&amp; 7, CHARING CROSS, S.W. 1871.JAMAICA AND ITS GOVERNOR during the last six years. Persons in England who have friends and relations in Jamaica, were startled a few days ago bv the announcement that a fresh outbreak was impending. 1 et those who know the island intimately could hardly have been surprised. The creed of the north ern nations, strengthened by the influence of Christi- .mitv, that work is honourable, not disgraceful,—has not taken root in the minds of the negroes. And that sect of Christians which has influenced the future of the island probably more than any other, has not used its power to fortify so noble a concep tion. y ears attention of England was con centrated on Jamaica, and the views taken of the conduct of a Colonial Governor, in a difficult position, almost formed the battle-cry of parties in England, and several Members and ex-Members of the Legis lature can trace the insecurity or loss of their seats to extreme views taken about the matter. Now that Jamaica has become a Crown Colony, and has no legislature of her own to express the views current in the country, as to how she should be governed, except half-a-dozen ollicial personages, a 2who, with four planters and merchants, form the Supreme Council ; it is of the last importance that public opinion in this country should be well-informed as to the state of the island -and, being well-informed, should make its voice heard and felt by the Governor. Lately, however, events have occurred near home calculated to throw West Indian and Colonial politics completely in the shade. An Empire overthrown, and an Empire reconstructed, among our nearest neighbours in Europe ; followed by a Jacquerie ou a grand scale, quenched in torrents of blood, has dwarfed the interest of the proceedings of a few hundred thousand negroes, and a few thousand white men —though these latter are bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh. When the news of the outbreak, false as they were, came to our ears, the first question that presented itself was:—' Are our forces in the island capable of overcoming any rebellion among the negroes ? It seems indeed doubtful whether the five companies of a line regiment, with the few artillerymen, and possibly a few black troops, who now compose the whole garrison, could cope with a general insui- rection of the blacks. But many of the philo-African, and ultra-Radical party at home will say: ' Why should there be an insurrection, are not the negroes at present perfectly well and justly governed ?' Whoever may complain of injustice, the negroes certainly cannot: but to suppose that therefore no insurrection is possible, is to imagine that the greater part oi them know when5 they are well off, and are content with that necessity for manual labour which the Deity has imposed for ever upon the majority of mankind. That this is not the case is shown by many an insurrection among other races as well as negroes. I left Jamaica in the summer of 1870. The Governor, Sir John Peter Grant, had not then re turned from his first visit to Europe', after governing the island for nearly five years. When first he came to Jamaica, he found everything unsettled. The insurrection of 1865 was thoroughly suppressed, and the Queen's power supreme over the Colonial legislature and revolutionary influences. At the same time, the authority of any Governor to quell a revolt had been considerably weakened by the proceedings of the Home Government in recalling Governor Eyre. Whatever opinions may be held as to the wisdom and justice of the executions during the suppression of the rebellion, there is no doubt that Governor Eyre did a very wise thing in per suading the Colonial Legislature to abolish itself. It consisted of two Houses : a Legislative Council chosen by the Governor, and a larger body called the House of Assembly, composed of members chosen by the parishes and towns of the island. The Council does not appear to have been injurious in its effects, but its influence was thrown into the shade by that of the Assembly, which possessed the power of the purse. This, at the time of the insurrection, con sisted of very heterogeneous materials: a few planters6 and merchants, some ol them in-involved circum stances ; lawyers—several of them coloured men, not always of the highest reputation, and flews %\lio found the general want ol ready money throughout the land a source of profit to themselves. ith these, a seat in the Assembly was the means of pro curing lucrative contracts for themselves or their friends. Every person of any position with whom I have conversed, admits that the abolition ot the Assembly was an undoubted benefit to the island. At no other time were members likely to sacrifice their interests to their patriotism, but when those who feared the rebels, and were anxious to preserve themselves and their estates irQin injury, by concen trating authority in one person, were joined by those who, from their sympathy with the rebellion, feared the fate of Gordon, and coalesced with the few who felt the Assembly to be an unmixed evil: a vast majority was secured, which carried the measure triumphantly. Thenceforward a new era opened for Jamaica. But though the Legislature was no more, many relics of its mal-administration remained. A large debt, the product of a reckless expenditure, partly on jobs, coupled with insufficient taxation, remained to be combatted. Year after year, the surplus ex penditure, necessitated by a Government steeped in corruption, had to be met by a fresh loan. At first, Sir John Peter Grant could not raise sufficient revenue to avoid having recourse to the old expedient, but7 this last year he lias triumphantly produced a very considerable surplus of revenue over outgoings, and the credit of the colony has been restored. This has been done in many ways. He has had the courage to impose extra taxation, at which of course a highly-taxed community, like that of Jamaica, grumble considerably. Then he has done his best to enforce the strict collection of the customs, and other taxes, which was much needed, as public morality in Jamaica on such a matter as smuggling, was, and is, lamentably low. This, on the other hand, has neces sitated the importation of fresh officials from England at high salaries. Then he has put a complete stop to all corrupt contracts, and has made a saving to the revenue by a more doubtful scheme of considerably cutting down the pensions guaranteed to members of the former Government, whereby he has offended many men, some of undoubted integrity, who held high positions, and allowed them a pretext for bringing a charge of want of good faith against his adminis tration. A considerable increase of expenditure has been caused by a scheme of the Governor's, which has not turned out the complete success it deserved. Instead of the rural police and parish constables, he has or ganized a constabulary on the Irish model, which now costs fifty thousand a year, or one-eighth of the entire expenditure of the island. They are armed with rifles and bayonets, have white Serjeants, and super intendents, but the materials for forming an efficient8 body of men do not seem available in Jamaica. Ft is perhaps early days to speak of them, but the seii.&gt;c of duty in blacks and browns, who compose the rank and file of the force, does not seem highly enough de veloped to stimulate them into doing their duty when acting by themselves, which policemen must do. Vain of his uniform the constable thinks more of strutting about, and showing himself off to an admiring circle of female friends, than of being a terror to evil doers. Perhaps the general opinion is that the constabulaiy would be useful in suppressing a slight disturbance, but that in anything approaching a general outbreak they would be swept away with the tide. When Sir John arrived in the island, he found a general impression existing, that in the lower Couits justice was not administered impartial!}, and that it cost too much when it was. The Supreme Court, and in particular the Chief Justice, has always been peculiarly free from all breath of suspicion, but many of the magistrates became such through political influence, and tumo notoriously unfit from their want of education to be put on the commission of the peace. At the same time charges of open injustice do not seem to have been often substantiated, but the deputies of the clerks to the magistrates, who did most of the work, thought more of multiplying the fees to be extorted from the negroes, than of aiding their superiors in affording them substantial justice. This has been discovered recently,and a wholesale reform both in their offices, and in those of the clerks of the peace, has been effected. In order to counteract the notion that injustice resulted from the action of the inferior tribunals, a number, I believe ten or twelve, of barristers were brought over from England, and constituted judges of districts, each of about 400 square miles. Most of these barristers had had but little practice before coming out, for men of experience are hardly likely to expatriate themselves, and shut themselves out from the hope of fame and a large income in time to come, for a stipend of £900 a year, with no immediate prospect of a rise. This want of experience, combined with a knowledge that their decisions would all be rigorously overhauled, on one side by a not too friendly body of planters; on the other, by a scruti nizing Government, and a violent party at home, has made them very timid in giving their decisions. One judge has already gained the name among the negroes of Judge ' Resarve,' from his habit of reserving his decision from court to court, an interval of a month. Against another grave complaints are made of delay in issuing an order to enforce a judgment already given, and perhaps the vigour and speed of the old petty sessions is hardly compensated for in the eyes of black men by the superior elaborateness and scientific character of the judgments of the new judges, coupled with their undoubted freedom from undue influence, except possibly a vague dread of that philo-African party at home, so much hated by the planters. B10 At first Sir John bethought himselt oi making merely an alternative court, giving each suitor a choice of going before either the magistrates, or the nc \\ judge, but habits asserting their supremacy, and the judges generally getting but little business, petty debt cases and others were reserved solely to then- decision. It is difficult to find fault with this arrangement of the Governor's, and his plan of giving an alternative court, which while it did not needlessly offend the planters, by abolishing their jurisdiction in toto, tended to correct their idea of justice, by setting up higher models of unbiassed decisions, and prevented any negro excusing an outrage on the plea that justice was denied him. Perhaps an almost better plan would have been to have constituted the judges chairmen of petty ses sions, with a new name, and some nominal work, their real work being that of presiding in the magis trates' courts. In that way the courts would have slowly but no less surely improved, no vigour would have been lost, the new judges would have been greatly assisted by the knowledge possessed by old West Indians of the character, and particularly of the dialect of the negroes, no easy matter for a new comer to understand, and no prejudices would have been offended. The disestablishment of the Church in Jamaica is due rather to the general policy of the Home Govern ment, than to the predilections ol the Governor. I he11 general feeling in Jamaica is, that it is a very un- fortunate step, and likely to be productive of injury to the island, i he proportion of ardent admirers of the Church is probably not so great in Jamaica as in England, and many of the clergy do not give satis faction. But all classes of the community, except the Baptists, feel that she is a civilizing agent of the greatest importance and usefulness, and that twenty- six thousand pounds a year is well spent in maintain ing her, and worth double as much as twice the sum spent on police. In the case of Jamaica, much stress should not be laid on the argument that those only should pay who benefit spiritually by her ministra tions. It is doubtful whether any nation has ever yet supported an establishment for the sake of the spiritual benefit thereby administered to the indi vidual, the cause has been either a superstitious wish to propitiate deities who might be hostile to the nation, or an instinctive feeling that a Church was conducive to morality, and that her services shed a civilizing and deepening influence over the relations of national and family life. In Jamaica every section of the community has benefited by the increased mo rality and civilization of any one class, and it would have been far more consonant with common sense, and the teachings of history to make grants in aid of Wes ley an, Moravian, Presbyterian, and Baptist congrega tions, than t d t: ke away he state assistance from the Church. Of course when the Bishop of Jamaica leaves his diocese to take care of itself for years, still B 2drawing the salary of £2000 a year, no very high degree of efficiency can be looked for from his undei officers, and several of the island clergy are no credit to their cloth, while many others who perform then- services properly and lead reputable lives, are de ficient in that zeal for the good of their flocks, which might fairly be looked for from educated and highly paid successors of the Apostles. Still there aie not wanting men among the clergy who work as hard as any curate in London, and whose churches are centres of influences for good, whose elfects it is almost im possible to overrate, and which long survives the removal or death of the minister. One clergyman has no less than four congregations to attend to, two of the churches being 25 miles apart, in a moun tainous country, where the roads are mere tracks, scarcely fit for goats. His churches are crowded, but not only does he look after the moral and spiri tual well-being of his flock, but he has organized an industrial school to teach the boys useful trades, such as carpentering. Some of the negroes dislike this, and say that minister may teach our children to read and write, not to work ; as it happens, he does both, the latter probably the more useful. To understand the position of religious sects in Jamaica, the history of the Baptists must be clearly comprehended. Years before emancipation there ex isted an Establishment in Jamaica, whose clergy, in addition to the stagnation then prevalent among well-paid incumbents at home, added the debili-13 tating eftect peculiar to a tropical climate. The Baptists then began to send out missionaries. These preached to the slaves: and the planters, un willing for them to have their minds enlightened by a sect with such democratic and revolutionary ten dencies, opposed them tooth and nail. Thencefor ward a war commenced productive of evil to both sides. The Baptists told the slaves that no man had a right to keep his fellow in bondage ; that their masters were oppressors and tyrants. Then taking the Old Testament as their guide rather than the New, they overlooked the exhortation of St. Paul, ' If ye are bond, seek not to be free,' and dwelt on the examples of Gideon and Ehud, who delivered the chosen of God from bondage, and s I cav the op pressor. Just before emancipation came the servile insurrection of 1832, when houses and sugar mills were burnt, and their occupiers often murdered. Those slaves who had most listened to the Baptist teaching were the ringleaders, even if some of the ministers were not privy to the rising. So when the insurgents were quelled with bullet and sabre, the opposition between Baptists and planters was inten sified. AVhen slavery was abolished, the missionaries, forgetful of the different prices of provisions at home, and in the island, where the earth is lavish of her bounties, incited the negroes to ask as much or more for a day's work than a labouring man would obtain in England. This the planters refused, and in many instances pulled down the huts of their slaves which were on their estates, determined not to have a14 number of tenants at their doors who were generally idle, and might be dangerous. These then squatted on waste land all over the country, and many planteis ruined by the difficulty of getting labour, and the decrease in the price of sugar, threw their estates into the market. Parts of them were purchased by the more industrious among the negroes, the old copper getting into the hands of the Jews, who be came rich and prosperous, and in conjunction with petty lawyers who had fattened on the charges foi drawing legal documents, and the exorbitant interest on the loans contracted by a number of landowners anxious to save themselves from utter ruin, forced their way into the House of Assembly, where they soon became supreme, and used their power to pro cure jobs for themselves and their friends. Ihis ruin of the planters affected also the Baptist missionaries. Their influence was in no small degree founded on antagonism to the old time masters; but as the former slaves retreated into the bush, (and it must be remembered that at least one quarter ot the island is still either unappropriated or never looked after,) they became less amenable to the guidance ot their spiritual directors, and less willing to pay for their support. Moreover they grew poorer as habits of idleness became fixed, and therefore less able to pay. This tempted the Baptist ministers, who at one time were so flourishing that they renounced all pecuniary assistance from home, to have recourse to doubtful expedients to increase their funds. One Baptist minister, who now is the pastor of a large congrega-15 tion, was asked by a member of his congregation, a black man, to buy a piece of land for him. The minister told the intending purchaser that he thought the purchase could be made for £140, and received that sum from the negro. The' bargain was struck for £100, and one day the vendor, who was a magis trate and a large employer of labour, met the negro, and said, referring to the purchase, ' How is it that your name was sent in to me as the buyer, not minister's?' 'Yes, massa, me buy it; but my massa sell land very dear.' ' It is well worth £100,' replied the planter. ' One hundred pounds! but me pay minister £140 for it.' As, however, the minister was acting simply as an agent, and only £100 had been paid the vendor, the magistrate had a long correspondence with the minister, and finally made him pay over to the negro the £40 he other wise would have pocketed. This story I can vouch for, as I had it from the magistrate himself. Many similar cases all over the country have produced their natural effect, and now the Baptists find it hard to support their ministers by the voluntary system, and several of them are now leaving the island from sheer want of support. Notwithstanding this failure of voluntary effort in their own case, they are anxious it should be applied to the Establishment, which they hate as the Church of the aristocracy at home, and of the planters in Jamaica. And not only do they wish the voluntary system applied in future, but a few months ago a resolution was proposed by a Baptist minister, and16 passed«at a large meeting ol their body, to petition the Government to be so dishonest as not to respect the life interests of the clergy now in the island, and not to permit the newly formed Church body to use the buildings hitherto set apart for the performance of divine worship by the Established C hurch. ^ M course Sir John could only look upon such a memo rial as the product of a dirty piece of spite ; not the result of high-toned Christian feeling. Very different is the position of A\ esleyans, Mora vians, and to a certain extent, of the Scotch 1 icsby- terians. They have never meddled with politics, or striven to make their influence as teachers of mora lity and Christianity a basis on which to raise a supei - structure of political supremacy. Consequently they are now more prosperous, more numerous, and moi e respected than they were at any previous time. J he planters, instead of opposing them, live on most friendly terms with their ministers, and their chapels are frequently attended by the families and servants of the neighbouring landowners. r l heir schools are often helped by members of the establishment, and present a far higher average of attainments than do those ol the Baptists. Though the stipends of the Wesley an clergy are supplemented from home when deficient, they collect a large portion of their incomes in the island, I believe £10,000 a year; and the Moravians do much the same. Instead of being the heroes of two rebellions, and at one time having such influence that a man who was convicted of kidnapping black chil-17 dren from Montego Bay and selling them in Cuba, was screened from all punishment by their wire pullers, because he was a Baptist, the Wesleyans, and Moravians, have devoted their attention to improving the morals and manners of their congregations, and many a cleanly, well dressed assembly of worship pers, whose homes are comparatively well built and neat, attest the benefit of their ministrations. I do not however include all the Baptist ministers in this indictment, there are a good many who have kept clear of politics, and have consequently been useful; but the general tendency of their body has been to act as politicians assailing the established order of things. Voluntaryism hitherto has been successful chiefly in English or American towns, where the population is dense, and generally well off. In Jamaica the conditions are reversed, the population is scattered, anything but frugal, and there are few rich men who generally live up to their means. With, I think, barely one-third more clergy, the quondam establish ment will have to collect nearly three times the income the Wesleyans extract from their flocks, already trained to give by years of the voluntary system, and the power, no Church which in any way claims to be national can exert, of refusing the com munion to those who have neglected to pay their monthly stipend. One would suppose that the Jews who abound in the colonv, are rather interested in the disestablish- J ' ment of a Church for which they pay taxes but derive18 no spiritual benefit. On the contrary tliey are as a rule most violent opposers of the measure, showing that in their view of the case, the slight pecuniary burden entailed by the extra taxation, is more than counterbalanced by the civilizing influence of the establishment, and the consequent stimulus given to agriculture and commerce. Moreover, I fear the Church has made a bad start. The Bishop of Kingston, a suffragan of the Bishop of Jamaica, has contrived to disagree with the Governor, regarding the formation of the ( hurch body. At the head of a party composed of sacramentarians, who do their best to narrow the Church down to a mere ecclesiastical sect, and those Low Churchmen, whose ideas of church government are drawn from the arrangements in vogue among Dissenters, he wished to stipulate that no one should be elected to the Church Congress, who was not a regular communicant. This the Governor refused to sanction, and decided that he would not hand over the buildings to the Church body till they had rescinded the rule for bidding the congregations to elect as their represen tatives to Congress, men who had not stayed the sacrament a sufficient number of times the } ear preceding.* This does not augur well, and these hitches give * Since the above was written, a second Synod has been held, composed of either communicant or non-communicant members as the different congregations have elected. This Synod the Governor has recognized as legal, but he has allowed it to pass a law preventing congregations from electing non-communicant representatives to Synod for the future.19 the negroes an excuse for not giving, of which they are quick to avail themselves, saying that they do not like to pay money to a body whose constitution is not fixed. Several of the best of the clergy have also been sent to plead the cause in England, and though subscriptions from the mother Church have not been wanting, the Church in Jamaica have felt their absence. All these conflicting interests and sects render Jamaica no easy country to govern. The negroes, or those who speak for them, claim perfect equality in all points with the white, and the black men are not slow to assert it. Probably no peasantry in the world is more independent than that of Jamaica, but their independence does not arise from strength of mind, but from freedom from the necessity of hard toil to sustain life. Though the population has in creased since emancipation, scarcely a quarter of the sugar and coffee formerly exported in the year is now produced, and much of that through coolie labour. The negroes have in great measure, both the virtues and vices of children, are susceptible of great personal attachment, are fickle, very excitable, and generally lazy and improvident. Some are exceedingly honest as servants, many incorrigibly addicted to pilfering, the prevalence of stealing from provision grounds is an all but universal complaint. As to the chastity of the blacks the less said about it the better, probably four-fifths of the births in the island are illegitimate. In this respect it must be allowed the planters set them a sorry example. A stranger entering the20 house of almost any white bachelor, will find one or more black or brown women on very friendly terms with the master, and a tribe of parti-coloured children. The browns of course follow the example of their befters, and so it happens that throughout Jamaica, ever excepting the white ladies, unblushing im morality is the all but universal rule. Occasionally in districts where a minister of any denomination has gained a great ascendancy over the negroes, a glimpse of better things appears, too often to be succeeded, when his presence is withdrawn, by the prevailing gloom. The planters, however, as well as the negroes, are difficult to govern. They feel that they have never been prosperous since 1846, when England broke the promise she made them at emancipation in 1833, and allowed slave grown Cuban sugar to enter her market on equal terms with their own. Many of them are men of education, some of refinement, and they are rendered uneasy by the feeling that they are going down in the world, often not by their own fault. Perhaps their fathers or grandfathers were grand people in the old slavery days, and made thousands, where their present representatives make but hun dreds. Still they keep up the old hospitable way of living, glad to see all comers, and give them board and lodging. Assuredly, the virtue of hospitality which has somewhat decayed in England in these days of railways and city life, still exists in all its former heartiness in Jamaica. But this habit renders it more difficult to economize, and to reduce one's21 establishment in accordance with failing resources, consequently the planters frequently get hopelessly ruined, and of course lay the blame on the Govern ment. The great hope for Jamaica seems to be that before long the negro population will have so increased, as to cause a struggle for existence similar to that which takes place in Harbadoes. Then the negroes will be obliged to work, and the necessity will tend to civilize them. I hough the natural increase is very large, the carelessness of mothers, and the mortality among children between one and six through eatino* O o unripe fruit, prevents the population from growing faster than about ten to twelve per cent, in a decade. This is approximate, as all attempts at taking a census hitherto have been notoriously imperfect. The white population also are slowly leaving the country, or becoming merged in the browns; it has decreased from over 20,000 in 1824 to less than 13,000 at the last census. This is much to be re gretted, as without white influence the blacks will slowly, but no less surely, sink back into barbarism, and England in one of her paroxysms of economy will abandon the island. ?sor would the brown element be sufficiently stable to entrust to them the task of civilizing the negroes. They may have the mental ability of the white father, but too often are without any portion of his honesty, candour, and courage; moreover, the blacks dislike them more than the whites, and not unfrequently despise them. Their general illegitimacy is however to be credited22 with a portion of the evil tendencies a mixture oi race generally develops. I&gt;ut then we have the example of Hayti, and there we see as time progresses since the French were driven out, the brown people gradually deepening their colour, and losing their civilization through constant intermarriage with the far more numerous pure blood negroes. It would be invaluable to the island if its merits as a Sanatorium in cases of chest disease were more generally known. No climate can be more thoroughly suited to make a complete cure of a weak chest than Jamaica. Many invalids are sent from England to Nice, where a warm sun, alternating with a piercing breeze from the snowy Alps, sweeps down the sides of the streets, and more often kills than cnres. Or Egypt is recommended, dry enough as a climate, but as distressingly cold by night as hot by day. In the West Indies alone is the temperature warm, yet generally equable, and the long sea voyage, which deters many, is perhaps of more advantage to the patient than double the time spent on land. If doc tors, when consulted, would more generally recom mend the 'West Indies, and hospitals would combine to have a joint sanatorium somewhere in the island of Jamaica, a very great benefit would accrue to all, as the patients would spend money, and many might be induced to take up their abode there after recovery, and exchange a life of continual struggle with disease at home for one of health and comfort in the most beautiful portion of the tropics. No wonder that the first discoverers were en-23 chanted with the West Indies. Perhaps the four islands of the Greater Antilles are the most beautiful in the world. No icebergs or glaciers have ever rounded the summits, and scooped out the valleys ol their limestone mountains. Every crag and conical hill rises sharp and distinct, and yet clothed with luxuriant vegetation. Cocoa nut and cabbage palm, bamboos, mango trees, pimento, oranges, mahogany, cedar, and the beautiful star apple, all evergreen, added to a luxuriant growth of grass, make the island always appear verdant. The cottonwood tree, a very air garden of orchids, attains a girth and size unknown in our northern climes. The seaports of the island are of course the portion most widely known, and though a magnificent view of the Blue Mountains is obtained on the approach to Port Royal and Kingston, the towns themselves, and country in the immediate neighbourhood, are far from prepossessing, and they have an unenviable reputation for unhealthiness. Probably there is reason for it, as the tides are very slight, and the island basin which forms the port ol Kingston is not incapable of collecting the drainage of the town, and so engendering fever. But in the production of death and disease among Europeans this natural defect is not so fatal as another. Many Englishmen landing in a tropical climate for the first time, often as mere lads, imagine that the depressing influence of the climate needs to be counteracted by an unusual amount of stimulant. I his in turn causes a reaction, which is combatted by renewed attention to the rum bottle. When actual drunken-24 ness does not take place, incessant tippling is quite capable of sowing the seeds of bilious derangement, and then when anything like an epidemic breaks out, there are hundreds of men whose constitutions are ready prepared to receive the disease. Ot course, the climate generally of the. West Indies gets the blame, which should be divided between an unhealthy locality and intemperate habits. ere the capital ol the island removed to Mandeville, 2500 teet al )0 \c the sea, which has a climate in June and J uly not hotter than an English summer, and in winter not unlike some parts of the south of Italy, it is very improbable that Europeans would find Jamaica unhealthy. Mandeville has a sufficient rainfall, is situated in delicious scenery on a plateau of rolling uplands, is nearly in the centre of the island, and in easy communication with Kingston. A railway already runs twenty-six miles of the way, and will very shortly be prolonged to Porus, eight or nine miles from Mandeville. A\ hen that is completed, a railway journey oi forty miles, and eight miles of a o-ood road, would constitute the whole difficulty ol access to the capital from the principal port. Though some of the Government offices are being removed to Kingston, Spanish Town is now the nominal capital. It is even worse fitted than King ston to be the metropolis. It is situated in a plain a few miles inland, where it loses much of the sea breeze, and on the edge of a morass. Surely while the seat of Government is being changed, it would be far better to remove it to Mandeville at once. In a few25 t years the island would gain by the alteration, even in a pecuniary point of view. An average European could work much harder, and would be able to stand the work much longer in Maudeville than in Kings ton or Spanish Town. This gain in the number of employes necessary, and in pensions, would soon pay the expenses of erecting the necessary new Govern ment buildings at Mandeville. Besides which, a lively town in a charming climate is not unlikely to attract winter visitors from Europe, besides render ing old West Indians less anxious directly they have saved a little money to go to England to spend it. Proprietors might become residents, instead of leaving their estates, as they often do, entirely in the hands of attorneys, while they reside in Europe. Thus the resident gentry now dying out in Jamaica would be recruited, and a very powerful instrument of civilization would be retained, and reinvigorated. As it is the Governor, who works harder than any one else, has, and probably finds it necessary to have, a residence in the St. Andrew's Mountains, eighteen or twenty miles from Kingston, and further from Span ish Town. Here in a charmingly situated and very comfortable house, over oOOO feet above the sea, he resides more than half the year, in a climate equable, but somewhat moist. 1 he time spent in going to and fro, is greater than would be required for the journey to Mandeville when the railway is completed. Most of the other high Government officials have also houses in the same mountains within a few houis drive or ride of the Governor, but the more scantily2G I paid civil servants cannot afford this luxury, and so have to spend their nights as well as their days in sultry Spanish Town or Kingston. As Sir John is an old Bengalee, and knows the benefit it is to India to have the virtual capital at Simla during the hot months, he will perhaps agree with the writer that the capital at Mandeville, with a Parliamentary season, would be beneficial to the island. Colonies of white settlers on the central range of mountains, would be useful to Jamaica in two ways; they would ensure security, and increase production. If districts in the hills, where the sun is not so hot as to prevent a European from working, and which are now uncultivated, were set apart for organized colo nies of white men, who held their grants of land on condition of military service, or service with the police, and these lands they were not allowed to alienate on any terms, various centres of civilization would be formed, and preserved, and secure nuclei of resistance to any attempt at rising among the blacks, would probably prevent such being thought of. The present constabulary are trusted neither to put down a general insurrection nor to repress crime, the militia and volunteer! which each parish used to furnish, have been systematically snubbed, and finally swept away by the Governor, and now the European troops have been reduced to five companies, a force quite inadequate to the wants of the island. If four settle ments were formed in the mountains, each of three hundred families of time-expired soldiers of good27 character, Jamaica would be quite safe. Now, though the blacks are generally contented and undoubtedly well governed, there is no certainty that any plausible villain might not be able any day to excite a few thousand blacks to commence a rebellion, and if not promptly localized, as was the last revolt, and were it once to get a-head, every coloured man, except a few about the capital, would join the rebels, simply be cause they have a strong idea of being on the winning side. If anything like this occurred, the dreadful scenes and heart-stirring barbarities which would be com mitted would tempt England to exterminate the negro race in the West Indies. But three hundred Europeans, well armed and disciplined, and decently commanded, should be able to hold their own against any number of negroes. In this way one station woul^ break the wave of rebellion, until the forces from the others, and from the rest of the island, had time to assemble and crush it out. For it cannot be too often repeated that whether Jamaica be regarded as a Crown colony, conquered by Englishmen before it was peopled by negroes, whom indeed our planters introduced to aid them; or whether it be considered a dependency principally inhabited by the black race, everything which tends to discourage the white element, and throw the island altogether into the hands of black men, is an enor mous evil. Absentee white proprietors, and negro squatters, and small freeholders are, and have beenfor long in their different ways, most prejudicial to the island. The negro is essentially an im.itati\e creatine, he copies both the virtues and the vices of the supeiiois with whom he is brought personally into contac t. Hence the necessity for European influence, and for that influence to be of a high character. Unfortu nately the Church has been disestablished, 'which will infallibly act in the way of bringing men of less educa tion and lower class of society into the ministry, which the negroes will not be slow in perceivings and the land is getting into the hands either of coloured men, or of persons of low attainments, who came out to the island as bookkeepers or mechanics, and in the sti uggh upwards have certainly learnt to make money, but too often have also learnt much of the disreputable wav of living prevalent among that class m the isltind. In some cases, however, they have intermairied A\ith the older families, and have now become respectable members of society. When no European influence is felt the negi o slowly but surely sinks back into the good-humoured, lazy, sensual, and intensely superstitious African. And African superstitions have something peculiarly diabolical about them, they are almost unmixed devil worship. 1 heir chief characteristic is h^stena, and an intense belief in witchcraft, which is piactised by Obeah men and women. If a man or woman has a grudge against another, he or she sends for the Obeah man, who, on a sufti-29 cicnt payment, proceeds to curse the object of his client's hatred. A few feathers of a white cock, some cat's teeth, possibly a few hairs of the person intended to be cursed, are put into a glass bottle, with a little dirty water, and placed in the ground before his door when he is known to be coming out. This of course would matter little, though occasionally negroes die from sheer fright when they find themselves under the ban of the wizard. But the Obeah man proceeds to idve weight to his curse, lie gives some poison to his client, with instructions to pour it into the water, or the coffee, that the Obeahed person is about to drink. More often he lurks about the house, and watches his opportunity himself to poison some food which his victim is on the point of eating. Occa sionally the Obeah man gets engaged as a servant, and carries under his finger nail some poisonous com pound which he drops into the coffee as he hands it. Almost every planter will acknoAvledge that it is generally esteemed a dangerous thing to allow any servant who has been discharged for bad conduct e\ei to enter the kitchen of his house. I he public in Eno-land have not the remotest idea of the numbei annually poisoned in Jamaica. One old man, sup posed to be respectable, lately died, who confessed to having directly or indirectly poisoned no less than 100 persons. Among the negroes themselves, if the survivors suspect poison to have carried off a i elati\ e, they never speak of it, fearing lest the Obeah man should follow it up by poisoning them also. But30 among the white families I stayed with on the island, J know of no less than six distinct cases within the last ten years in which the Obeah man was employed by some enemy to curse and poison their relations or dependents. In two of these cases death resulted from the operation of the poison, and but two or three years' imprisonment was supposed to be enough punishment for the Obeah man who was convicted on one of these occasions. Nevertheless, old Jamaica planters assert that, on the whole, Obeahism, though terribly frequent, is less so than it used to be. Pro bably a system of compulsory registration of deaths, and another of careful post-mortem examination in all cases where the cause of death is not clear, would diminish the horrid prevalence of the crime. This trait, more than any other, will probably con vince the English public how essentially different is the nature of the negro to their own. An individual, perhaps a servant or a workman, who will procure the poisoning of his employer or overseer, because he will not allow his servant's pigs to run over his meadow, or because he imposes a fine for leaving openvtlie gate between the meadow and the cane piece, and so losing a quantity of valuable canes through the depredations of the stock, is very different from the ' poor black angel' of Exeter Hall notoriety. The fact is, nothing does the coloured inhabitants of Jamaica more harm than the alternate showers of praise and caresses, and of angry vituperation which is rained upon them. If Exeter Hall unduly31 exalts, there must and soon will be a reaction, and pianterdom will unduly cry down, thus the kind feel ing which should exist between the two races is dis sipated and destroyed. What is wanted is that the planters, and all those who come in contact with Quashee, should behave kindly, honourably, and justly; not as they occasionally do, as if the blacks were mere animals to be caressed, petted, joked with, and sworn at, as the fancy of the moment went, but rather with that mixture of kindness and dignity with which the English gentry treat their tenants. And it is equally incumbent upon the Government and people of the old country to be very careful how they encourage a spirit of mutiny and sloth among the blacks. If the philo-African party have any regard for the real interests and advancement of the negroes, O / and do not wish merely to make political capital out of them for home use, they will not hold them to be an oppressed race, to be stimulated into assertions of independence, sure to culminate in a rising, but rather as children to be disciplined by the white clergy and laity among them. The attempt made some time ago by the anti- slavery party to prevent coolie immigration into Jamaica, is a terrible instance of want of comprehen sive views. The planters were being ruined through the sloth of the negroes, and the low price of sugar consequent upon the free competition of slave-grown Cuban sugar. Yet this party who, by generally assisting free trade, had immensely stimulated32 slavery in Cuba, were very unwilling to allow the in troduction of a free and superior race into Jamaica, who would work, and thus drive the negroes into doing the same, the very thing of all others which in the true interests of the latter is most important. Had the planters been utterly ruined, the civilization of the blacks would have been put back for genera tions ; as it is, the introduction of coolies into Jamaica is burdened with many more restrictions than are thought necessary for Trinidad and Demerara. Nor should the Colonial Government forget, that though the planter once was a slaveowner, from which the British Government bought his chattels for £21 a piece, one-fifth of the then market value, he still has a right to the full possession of whatever land he may retain; and though in many cases abuses may have to be corrected, and a higher tone of society en forced, yet whatever tends to diminish the white population of Jamaica, can hardly fail to have, in the long run, a most injurious effect on all concerned. the end.f azk -V THE REVIVAL of CHRISTIANITY IN SYRIA: ITS MIRACLES AND MARTYRDOMS. RELATED BY P. london: edward stanford, 6 and 7, charing cross, s.w. Price Sixpence.THE CHRISTIAN REVIVAL IN SYRIA. ' Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me.'—Job, ch. xix, v. 21. CHRISTIANITY was born and grew in Syria. She gave the light of the Gospel to the world. The grace of God has returned to Syria. Shall she struggle single-handed with Moslem cruelty and oppression, unaided by the Christian powers who owe to her the Light of Faith ? The heading ot these pages will not a little surprise many but not all of my readers, who will be divided into two classes—those familiar with old prophecies, and those who are not. The first will expect, the others will not expect, to hear that Christianity has revived s'pon- taneously, unaided by missionaries, catechists, or consuls, in this fanatical Moslem land, especially in Damascus, the 'Gate of the Holy City, the ancient capital of the Caliphs, where, even at present. Chris tian representatives of great Powers are not allowed to fly their flags. But the movement has taken place; it grows every year, its conse quences are difficult to see, impossible to calculate. The conversion of the Mahometans has begun at last, without England's sending out, as is her custom, shiploads of Bibles or spending one fraction upon it; and in this great work, so glorious to Christianity, England, if old' traditions are about to be verified, is to have a large share. She must now decide whether the Revival of Christianity, in the land which gave it birth, shall spread its goodly growth far and wide, or whether it shall be cut down by the hand of the destroyer. llxe first step in this movement, taken as far back as 1868, v\as heralded by signs and tokens and graces, which partake of the miracle and of the revelation. And here, at the beginning, I may remind my readers, especially Protestant readers, that the Lord has a mighty arm brachium Domini non est abbreviatum ' —and that in this same city of Damascus, the terrible persecutor, Saul of Tarsus, became S. Paul, not by reading, nor by conversations with Christians, but by the direct interposition of Jesus Christ. The visions and revelations which I am about to record rest upon the same solid basis as Christianity itself—that is to say, upon the unanimous tes timony borne to them by sincere and devout men, who have no purpose to serve, and who have risked their all in this world without any possible object but to testify to mankind the truths revealed to them. We need not delay to consider whether the graces and tokens which have been vouchsafed are natural, preternatural, or supernatural; objective or subjective. Suffice it for us that they have been submitted to crucial4 tests, and that even this philosophic and incredulous age cannot deny that they have taken place. About four years ago a small body ol Moslems who inhabit the May- dan, or southern suburb of Damascus, had been initiated into the Shadili Order of Moslems bv one Abd el Karim Matar, of Darayya, whose touching end will presently be recounted. This man, a mere peasant, left his wife, his family, and his relations in his native village, in order to become Shayk of the Dervishes, and he hired a house in the Sukh- khaneh quarter of the Maydan. It is bisected by the long street through which the annual Hajj Caravan passes out en route to Mecca, and its in habitants, with those of the Shaghur quarter, are held to be the most bigoted and fanatical of their kind. Through the influence of the Shadilis, however, not a Christian life was lost in their quarter during the dreadful massacre of i860; many indeed were hidden by the people in their houses, and were sent privily away without the walls after the three days of bloodshed had passed. Our Lord, who promises to remember even the cup of cold water given in His name, did not, as will presently appear, forget these acts of mercy to the terrified Christians. I am going to assume that all my readers are not perfectly au courant of the many sub-divisions of the influential and wide-spread religion— El Islam. The order of Shadili Dervishes was founded by Abd el Husayn Shadili, who died at Mecca in a.h. 656 (a.d. 1258). They are not, therefore, one of the 12 originally instituted, and for that reason they are rarely noticed by writers upon Eastern Spiritualism (for instance, The Dervishes, by John P. Brown. London: Triibner. 1868). They obtained fame, however, by introducing to the world coffee, so-called from the Abyssinian province of Kafa. The use of coffee in Yemen, its origin and first introduction into that country, are due to the learned Ali Shadili Abu Omar, one of the disciples of the learned doctor Nasr Ood Deen, who is regarded as one of the chiefs, and whose worth attests the high degree of spirituality to which they had attained. {First Footsteps in East Africa, p. 78. London; Longmans. 1856.) The Shadili are Sufis or Mystics, esoterics from El Islam, who have attempted to spiritualize its material portions. This order, like all others, admits of two main divisions, the Sharai or orthodox, and the Ghayr-Sharai, who have greatly departed from the doctrines of El Islam. The vital tenets of the heterodox are— 1. God alone exists. He is in all things and all things are in Him— evidently mere pantheism, 2. All things visible and invisible are an emanation from Him, and are not really distinct from Him—this is the Eastern origin of the clas sical European ' diviua:particula aura.' 3. Heaven and hell and all the dogmas of positive faiths are allegories, whose esoteric meaning is known only to the Sufi. 4. Religions are a matter of indifference ; that however is the best which serves as the means of reaching true knowledge, such as El Islam, whose philosophy is Tasawwuf (Sufi-ism.)L 5. There is no real distinction between good and evil, for all things are one and God fixes the will of man, whose actions therefore are not free. 6. The soul existed before the body, and is confined in it as a bird in a cage. Death therefore is desirable to the Sufi whose spirit returns to the Deity whence it emanated. Evidently the ' Anupadishesha Nir vana' of the Hindu, absolute individual annihilation. 7. The principal duty of the Sufi is meditation on the unity which ad vances him progressively to spiritual perfection, and which enables him lo ' die in God.' 8. Without ' Fayz Ullah' (Grace of God) this spiritual unity cannot be attained ; but God favours those who fervently desire such unifica tion. ( The general belief in these tenets has given the Shadili Order a doubtful name amongst the multitude, who consider it to profess, like the ' Babis ' of Persia, opinions of a subversive and anti-Islamitic nature. The orthodox portion, however, is not blamed, and at Damascus one of its members is a conscientiously religious Moslem, the Sayyid Abd el Kadir of Algerian fame, whose name is still so well known in Europe and who is beloved and respected by all. The Syrian Shadilis are distinguished by white robes and white skull-caps and turbans, of which they allow the inner flap to protrude a little from the folds behind the ears. Abd el Karim Matar and his Shadili acolytes used to meet for private worship at his house in the Maydan suburb, and they spent nights and days in praying for enlightenment before the throne of Grace. Their numbers varied from 60 to 70, and even more. Presently after, per severing in this new path, some of them began to be agitated by doubts and disbelief; the religion did not satisfy them, they anxiously sought for a better. They became uncertain, disquieted, undetermined, yet unable, for fear of being betrayed, to declare even one to another the thought which tormented them. Two years had been spent in this anxious, unhappy state, each thinking himself the only one thus subject to the tortures of conscience. At length they were assured by a vision that it was the religion of Christ which they were seeking. Yet such was their dread of treachery that none could trust his secret with his neighbour till they had sounded one another, and had found that the same idea was uppermost in every mind. Presently about 40 of them, headed by Abd el Karim Matar, met for their usual night-prayers ; after prolonged devotional acts, all fell asleep, and Our Lord was pleased to appear to all of them separately. They awoke simultaneously, and one, taking courage, recounted his vision to the others, when each responded, ' I also saw Him '! Christ had so consoled, comforted, and exhorted them to follow His faith, and they were so filled with a joy they had never known, that they were hardly dissuaded from running about the streets to proclaim thai Christ is God ; but they were cdmonished that they6 would only be slaughtered, and rob the city of all hope of entering the same fold. They wanted a guide, director and friend who could assist their tottering steps in the new way which they were now treading, and they heartily prayed that God would be pleased mercifully to provide them with the object of their desire. One night, after again meeting, as before, for acts of devotion, sleep overcame them, and they saw them selves in a Christian church, where an old man with a long white beard, dressed in a coarse brown serge garment, and holding a lighted taper, glided before them, and smiling benignantly never ceased to cry, 'Let those who want the truth follow me.' On awaking each told his dream to the other, and they agreed to occupy themselves in seeking the person who had appeared to them. They searched in vain through the city and its environs for a period of three months, during which they continued to pray. One day it so hap' pened that one of the new converts, H K , now at J , entered by chance the Monastery of the RR. Fathers of the Terra Santa, near Bab Tuma, the north-eastern gate of Damascus. This is an establishment of Spanish Franciscans, who enjoy French protection by virtue of a Papal Bull and of immemorial usage. What was his astonishment to see in the Superior, Fray Emanuel Forner, the per sonage who had appeared to him in his dream. This saintly man, Latin Cnri and Franciscan of the Terra Santa, approached and asked the Moslem what he was seeking. The Neophyte replied by simply telling his tale and that of his comrades, and then ran speedily to inform the others, who flocked next day to the monastery. The poor padre was greatly perplexed. He reflected that visions do not happen every day. He feared some political intrigue, of which Damascus is a focus ; he doubted their sincerity, and he dreaded to endanger the city and to cause for the sake of the 40 another massacre like that of 1860. On the other hand, he still more dreaded to lose 40 sincere souls by refusing to them baptism. However, concealing his agitation, he received them with touching kindness, he gave them books which taught them all the Christian doctrine, and he instructed them how to meet in prayer for mutual comfort and support. Lastly, he distributed to each a crucifix, the symbol of their new faith. This event took place in the early spring of 1870. Friar Emanuel remained for about four months in this state of dilemma, praying to know the will of God, and he was admonished as to what he should do. Having performed his task on earth, he fell asleep quietly one day about three months after- wards. Some said the death was caused by climate, but many of his most intimate friends, living a few hours from the convent, did not hear of it till late in November, 1870, and then they had cause to suspect treachery. The converts, now numbering some 250, held regular prayer meet ings in one another's houses, and these could not fail to attract the notice of the neighbouring Moslems. Later still a crucifix or two was seen, and suspicions ripened into certainties. The local authorities were7 at once informed of what had happened. The Ulema or learned men who in El Islam represent the Christian priesthood) were in consternation. They held several sessions at the house of Shaykh Dabyan, a noted fanatic living in the Maydan suburb. At length a general meeting took place in the town-house of the Algerine Amir Abd el Kadir, who has ever been held one of the ' Defenders of the Faith ' at Damascus. The assembly consisted of the following Ulema :— 1. Shaykh Riza Effendi el Ghazzi. 2. Abdullah el Halabi. 3. Shaykh el Tantawi. 4. Shaykh el Khani. 5. Shaykh Abdu Razzak (el Baytar) and his brother. 6. Shaykh Mohammed el Baytar. 7. Shaykh Salim Samara. 8. Shaykh Abd el Ghani el Maydani. 9. Shaykh Ali ibn Saati. 10. Said Efifendi Ustuwaneh (the Naib el Kazi or assistant judge in the Criminal Court of the Department at Damascus), and other intimates of the Amir. Riza Effendi, now dead, was a determined persecutor of the Nazarene, and Abdullah el Halabi, also deceased, had pronounced in i860 the Fatwa or religious decree for the massacre of the Christian Community, and had been temporarily banished instead of being hanged as high as Haman. These specimens will suffice. Still let us be just to the Presi dent of this assembly. He was carrying out a religious duty in sitting in judgment upon renegades from his faith, and he was acting in accordance with his conscience ; but, during the massacre of i860 he not only extended his protection to the Christians but he slept across his own threshold on a mat, lest any terrified and supplicating wretch might be turned adrift by his Algerine followers. The assembly, after a long discussion, pronounced the sentence of death upon the converts. The only exceptions were the Amir Abd el Kadir and the Shaykh Abd el Ghani el Maydani, who declared ' that a live man is always better than a dead man.' ihe Shaykhs lantawi and El Khani declared ' that to kill such perverts was an act more acceptable to Allah than the Friday prayer.' If there be one idea more strongly fixed than any other in Moslem brain it is this—the renegade from El Islam shall surely die. His death must be compassed by any means, fair or foul : perjury and assassina tion are good deeds when ilevoted to such an end. The Firman of February I2th, 1856, guaranteed, it is true, life and liberty to a// con verts ; it was in fact a perfect system of religious toleration on paper. But it was never intended to be carried out, and the local 1 urkish authori ties throughout the empire have, doubtless acting under superior instruc tion, ignored it as much as possible. The usual practice in the Turkish dominions when a convert is to be convicted, opens with a preliminary imprisonment, either on pretence of 'counselling' him, or upon some false charge. Ihe ciiminal— „ 8 tribunal then meets ; witnesses are suborned ; the defence is not lis tened to ; a ' Mazbatah,' or sentence, is drawn out, and the victim is either drafted off with the Nizam (regular troops), or sent to the galleys or transported to some distant spot. The assembly, however, not daring to carry out the sentence of death, determined that the perverts must be exiled, and that their houses and their goods must be destroyed or confiscated. A secret Majlis was convened without the knowledge of the Christian members of the tribunal, and this illegal junto de spatched, during the night, a squadron of cavalry and a regiment of infantry, supported by a strong force of police, to occupy the streets of the Maydan. Some 50 Shadilis were known to have met for prayer at the house of one Abu Abbas. At four o'clock Turkish time (10 p.m.) they rose to return home. Many of them passed amongst the soldiery without being alarmed, and whilst so doing 14 were separately arrested and carried to the Karakuns (guard-houses) known as El Kaah, and the Sinnaniyyeh. Here they were searched by the soldiery and made to give up their crucifixes. They were then transferred, some to the so-called great prison in the Serai or government house, others to the Karakun jail in the government square, and others to the debtors'jail, then at the Maristan or Mad-house, now transferred to Sidr Amud near Bab el Barid. I hasten to record the names of the 14 chosen for the honour of martyrdom. All were sincere and inoffensive men, whose only crime was that of being Christians and martyrs ; the rulers, however, had resolved upon crushing a movement which, unless arrested by violence, would spread far and wide throughout the land. 1. Abu Abbas (the man in whose house the prayer-meeting was held). 2. S4id Ishani. * 3. Abu Abduh Bustati. 4. Abd el Ghani Nassas and his son. 5. Mohammed Nassas. 6. Ghanaym Dabbas. 7. Salih el Zoh. 8. Abdullah Mubayyad. 9. Ramaxan el Sahhar. 10. Salih Kachkul. 11. Mohammad Nammureh. 12. Bekr Audaj. 13. Mohammad el Dib. 14. Marjan min el Kisweh. After some days they were brought to the great secret Majlis (tri bunal), at which presided in person his Excellency the Wali, or go vernor-general of Syria, Mohammid Rashid Pasha. This officer, a protege of the late Aali Pasha, grand vizier at Constantinople, has been allowed to rule the province of Syria for the unusual term of more than five years, and the violence and rapacity displayed by him and his creatures have doubtless added an impulse to the Revival of Christianity —it was evil working for good. With a smattering of Parisian education,9 utterly without religion, but determined to crush conversion because it would add to that European influence which he has ever laboured to oppose, Rashid Pasha never conceals his conviction that treaties and firmaas upon such a subject as Moslem conversion are so much waste paper, and he threatens all who change their faith with death, either by law or by secret murder, a threat which—as the cold cruelty of his na ture suggests—is not spoken in vain. And he uses persecution with the more readiness as it tends to conciliate the pious of his own creed, who are greatly scandalized by his openly neglecting the duties of his religion, such as prayer and fasting, and by other practices which may not be mentioned here. The Governor-General opened the sessions by thus addressing the accused ;— Are you Shadili ? Answer : We once were, we now are not. Gov.-Gen. : Why do you meet in secret, and what is done at those meetings ? Answer : We read, we converse, we pray, and we pass our time like other Damascus people. Gov.-Gen. : Why do you visit the Convent of the Faranj (Franks or Europeans) ? Abu Abbas ; Is it not written in our law that when a Moslem passes before a Christian church or convent, and finds himself hurried by the hour for prayer, he is permitted to enter and even to pray there ? Gov.-Gen. : You are Giaours (infidels) ! Abu Abbas (addressing one of the Ulema) : What says our law of one who calls a faithful man Giaour ? Answer : That he is himself a Giaour. The Governor-General was confounded by this decision, which is strictly correct. He remanded the 14 to their respective prisons. Here they spent three months awaiting in vain the efforts of some intercessor. But they had been secretly tried, or their number might have attracted public attention ; the affair was kept in darkness, and even two years afterwards not a few of the Europeans resident at Damascus had never heard of it. The report reached the consular corps in a very modified form—persecution had been made to assume the semblance of political punishment. The Russian Consal, M. Macceef, succeeded in procuring their temporary release, but this active and intelligent officer was unable to do more. The British Consul could hardly enter into a matter which was not brought officially before his notice. The Consul of France and the Spanish Vice-Consul took scant notice of the Shadili movement, perhaps being unwilling to engage in open warfare with the Governor- General, possibly deeming the matter one of the usual tricks to escape recruitment or to obtain a foreign passport. The Neophytes, however, found an advocate in Fray Emanuel Forner, before mentioned. This venerable man addressed (March 29, 1870) a touching appeal to the General of his Order, and his letter appeared in the Correspondance dtIO iftw/e (June n, 1870). The Franco-Prussian war, however, absorbed all thoughts in Europe, and the publication fell still-born from the Press. Fray Emanuel relates in his letter that one day, when visiting the Neophytes before their imprisonment--he modestly passes over the im portant part which he had taken in converting them—he asked them if they could answer for their constancy. The reply was : 'We believe not simply through your teachings of the Word, and through our read ing the religious books which you gave us, but because the Loid Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to visit us and to enlighten us Himself, whilst the Blessed Virgin has done likewise !' adding, ' How could we without such a miracle have so easily become Christians ?' The good priest would not express his doubts, for fear of ' offending one of these little ones.' He felt an ardent desire to enquire into the visions and the reve lations to which they alluded. But he did not neglect to take the neces- sary precautions. Assembling his brethren, and presiding himself, he began with the unfortunate Salih, and he examined and cross-questioned the converts separately. He found them unanimous in declaring that on the first night when they witnessed an apparition, they had prayed for many hours, and that slumber had overcome them, when the Saviour Jesus Christ appeared to them one by one. Being dazzled by the light they were very much afraid j but one of them, taking courage, said . 0 Lord, may I speak?' He answered : 'Speak.' They asked: ' Who art thou. Lord?' The apparition replied: 'I am the Truth Whom thou seekest. I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Awakening agitated and frightened, they looked one at the other, and one took courage and spoke, the rest responding simply 'I also saw Him.' Christ had once more so consoled, comforted, and exhorted them to follow his path, and they were filled with such ineffable joy, love, faith and gratitude, that, but for His admonishing them (as He used to admonish the disciples), they could hardly restrain themselves from rushing into the streets and from openly preaching the Gospel to the Infidel City, On another occasion the Blessed Virgin stood before them with the Child Jesus in her arms, and, pointing to Him, said three times in a clear and distinct voice, ' My son Jesus Christ, Whom you see, is the Truth.' There are many other wonderful revelations whose truth I can vouch for, but I feel a delicacy of thrusting them before unbelievers. Indeed, I have kept back half of what 1 know, and I am only giving the necessary matter. Of the 14 Christian converts remanded to prison two were suffered to escape. The relations of Mohammad Dib and Marjan bribed the authorities and succeeded in proving an alibi. Abd el Karim Matar, the Chief of the Shadilis, who had been placed in confinement under the suspicion of being a Christian, fell ill, and his relations by giving bribes and by offering bail carried him off to his native village Darayya. There as he was now bed-ridden, the family gathered around him crying ' Istash'had ! ' That is to say, ' Renew the faith (by bearing witness to Allah and his prophet Mohammad).' The invalid refused, turningII his face towards the wall whilst his cruel relations struck and maltreated him. The cry was incessantly repeated and so was the refusal. At last such violence was used that the unfortunate Abd el Karim expired, the protomartyr of the Revival. On the night of Ramazan i. a. h. 1286 (December, a. d. 1869) the 'twelve' (acurious coincidence that it was the number of the first Apostles in this very land), who remained in prison were secretly sent ironed, vid Beyrout, to the dungeons of Chanak Kalessi (the Dardanelles fortress). Thence they were shipped off in a craft so cranky and dan gerous that they were wrecked twice, at Rhodes and at Malta. At last they were landed at Tripoli in Barbary, and they were finally exiled to the distant interior settlement of Murzuk. Their wives and children, then numbering 62, and now 53, were left at Damascus to starve in the streets, but for the assistance of their fellow-converts and of the Terra Santa Convent. It is a touching fact that if one of these poor converts has anything, he will quickly go and sell it, and use the profit in common, that all the brethren may have a little to eat. The Porte is inexorable, even ILL M. of Austria was, it is reported, unable to pro cure the return of the exiles. Yet probably the ' Commander of the Faithful,' Sultan Abdul Aziz, will ere long expect Austria as well as England and the rest of Western Europe to fight his battles. I call upon the world that worships Christ to punish this high-handed violation of treaty, this wicked banishment of innocent men. Catholic and Protestant are in this case both equally interested. The question at once concerns not only the 12 unfortunate exiles and their starving families. It involves the grand principle of religious toleration which interests even the atheist and the infidel throughout the Turkish Empire, throughout the Eastern World. Upon the answer depends whether Christianity shall be allowed free growth and absolute development. Let England demand of the Porte the removal of this governor-general. Deliver us from this modern Herod ! Let Abdul Aziz call off his dog from worrying the followers of Christ for the sake of the bones thrown to him by Aali Pasha, his Grand Vizier. Send us an honest man, unlike Rashid Pasha, who will not dare to rend asunder the most solemn ties that can bind nations, who will have the courage to do his duty. Amongst the Shadili converts was a private soldier of the Nizam or Regulars, aged 23, and bearing the highest character. About five months after the movement commenced, the soldier Ahmed el Sahhar being in barracks retired to a corner for prayer and meditation, when suddenly Our Saviour stood before him, and said, ' Dost thou believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God ? I am He.' The youth at once replied, like the man blind from his birth, ' Lord ! I believe. ' Jesus said to him, ** Thou shalt not always be a soldier ; thou shalt return Iree to thy home upon which Ahmed enquired, ' How can I set mysell Iree ? Jesus again said, ' I will deliver thee,' and with these words the beatific vision disappeared. The young soldier had fallen into a state of ecstasy. Presently he12 arose and passed through the barracks, exclaiming, 'Jesus Christ is my God ! Jesus Christ is my God !' His comrades were scandalized ; a crowd rushed up, some covered his mouth with their hands ; others filled it with dirt, and all dealt out freely blows and blasphemies. At last it was decided that Ahmed had become possessed of a devil, and, whilst he preserved perfect tranquillity, heavy chains were bound upon his neck, his arms, and his legs. At that moment Jesus Christ again appeared to him, and said, ' Break that chain ! He said. How can I break it, it being of iron ? ' and again the voice spoke louder, 'Break that chain.' He tore it asunder as though it had been of wax. A heavier chain, was brought, and the same miracle happened once more. This was reported to the officers, and by them to their Bey or Commandant; the latter sent for the private and after heaping reproaches, abuse, and threats upon him, ordered him to be imprisoned without food or water, and to be carefully fettered. Still for a third and a fourth time the bonds fell off, and supernatural graces and strength were renewed to the prisoner, who made no attempt to move or to escape from his gaolers. The soldiers fled in fear, and the commandant no longer dared to molest the convert. The case was represented to Constantinople, and orders were sent that Ahmed must appear at the capital. He was despatched accordingly under an escort, and with his wrists in a block of wood acting as handcuffs. Reaching Diurat, a village three hours from Damascus, he saw at night the door of his room fly open, and the Blessed Virgin entering, broke, with her own hands, the block of wood and his other bonds. By her orders he walked back alone to Damascus and reported himself to his regiment. It was determined this time to forward him with a party of soldiers, but without chains or ' wood. Arrived at Constantinople, the accused was brought before a court- martial ; a medical man was consulted as to his sanity, and the prisoner was not a little surprised to find himself set at liberty, and fiee to go where he pleased. Thus the promise of Jesus Christ was fulfilled. 1 he Neophyte took the name of 'Isa,' which is Jesus, and returned to Damascus, where his history became generally known.^ The Turks pointed him out as the ' soldier who broke four chains. ' Some term him the ' Majmin,' the madman, though there is nothing about him to indicate the slightest insanity ; but most of the people held him in the highest respect, calling him Shaykh Ahmed, and thus raising him to the rank of ' Santon,' or saintly man. The terrible example of the Shadili families has not arrested the movement -persecution never does-the blood of the martyrs is still the seed of the Church. But the converts now conduct their proceedings with more secresy. They abstain from public gatherings, although they occasionally visit Fray Dominic d'Avila, Padre Guardiano, or Superior ofthe Terra Santa. The society has now assumed a socialistic cha- racter, with private meetings for prayers, and with the other precautions of a secret order. The number of converts has greatly increased. At the end of 1869 the males in the City of Damascus amounted to 500 ; ini3 1870 it had risen to 4100; and in 1871 it represents 4900, of whom some 700 have been secretly baptized. Moreover, I have been assured by the converts with whom I associate and converse freely and fre quently, some of them being men highly connected and better educated than their persecutors, that a small tribe of freebooters living in and about the Druze mountain (Jebel Druze Hauran) having been troubled and threatened by the local Government, has split into two parties— Moslem and Christian, the latter known by crosses hoisted upon their tent roofs. The converts described to me the Bukaa (Ccelesyria) as a field in which the Gospel has lately borne fruit, and this was unex pectedly confirmed. The peasantry of B , a little village on the eastern slope of the Lebanon, and near Shtora, the central station of the French road, lately became the property of a certain M. A T . He owned two-thirds of the village, but by working the authorities he managed to get into his hands the whole of the houses and fields, the crops and cattle, in fact all the village property. The wretches, after being nearly starved for months, lately came up to Damascus and begged to be received as Christians. In early July it was whispered that the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Mgr Valerga, is expected to meet, at his summer residence in Beyrout, Mgr Franchi, the Papal Envoy, that both these Prelates will visit Damascus, and that then these poor souls will ask for baptism. Protestantism has also had its triumphs. About 10 months ago a certain Hanifi Moslem, named Abd el Razzak, having some misgivings about his faith, left his native city Baghdad in order to visit the Bab or head of the Babi sect who lies in the galleys of S. Jean d'Acre—what a place for such a purpose ! The interview not being satisfactory, he travelled to Damascus, where he came under Protestant influence. Thence he was removed to Shtora on the French road, and finally to SukelGharb in the Maronite mountains. There he was enabled to study, and he was publicly baptized under the name of Abdallah. The Turkish authorities had no power over him ; but the second case did not end so well. A certain Hajj Hassan, a coachman in the service of a Christian family at Beyrout, M. Joachim Najjar, began about 1869 to attend the Protestant service, and for two months before his incarceration he pro fessed himself a Christian although he had not been baptized. He is described by all who know him as a simple and sincere man, gifted with great strength of will. He was waylaid, beaten, and finally cast with exceeding harshness into prison at Beyrout by the governor Rauf Pasha, who replied to all representations that he was unable to release him, he acted, in fact, under superior' authority. The convert was not allowed to see his family, and on Thursday, June 29, he was sent in charge of a policeman to the Capital: this too despite the remonstrances of the Consuls-General for the United States and Prussia. The superintendent of the British Syrian school where the convert has a child, took the precaution of despatching to head-quarters one of the employes, the Rev. Mr. Waldmeier, so that energetic action beganu even before the arrival of Hajj Hassan. Rashid Pasha commenced by treating with contempt her Majesty's Consul s strong appeals to his justice; he openly ignored the Treaty, blaming Captain Burton for not having quoted the actual article, and he declined to permit the inter ference of strangers in the case of a subject of H.I.M. the Sultan. He maintained that he had a right to send for the Neophyte in order that the latter might be ' counselled and for that purpose he placed him under arrest in the house of the most bigoted Moslem in Syria, the chief of police, Mir Alai (Colonel) Mustafa Bey. He complained strongly of the conduct of Protestant missionaries in Syria, accusing them of secretly proselytizing, though he admitted in the same sentence that the convert Hassan had openly attended a Christian church for some time. On the next day he ungraciously refused Captain Bur ton's request that the Presbyterian missionaries (Rev. Messrs. Wright, Crawford, and Scott) might be allowed access to the Neophyte. About midday on Friday, June, 30, Rashid Pasha sent for Hajj Hassan, who had been duly disciplined by the police, and locking the door, he began to ask whether the convert was not in fear of being strangled—words, which, in his mouth, had a peculiar significancy. He then proceeded to offer a price for apostasy which rose to 30,000 piastres. This was stoutly refused by the Neophyte, who was returned to arrest. Presently the Governor-General heard that H.B.M's. Consul had tele graphed for permission to proceed to Constantinople to represent to his Ambassador the state of things in Syiia within his district, and Hajj Hassan was ordered to return under the charge of a policeman to Beyrout. The new Christian, however, was warned that he must quit that port together with his family within 20 days, under pain of being sent to Con stantinople handcuffed, or as the native phrase is 'in wood.' The case of Hajj Hassan came to a lame and impotent conclusion. He had been delivered out of the Moslem stronghold, Damascus, to the safe side of the Lebanon. The Protestant Christians of Beyrout with their schools. Missions, and Consuls-General to back them up, should have kept him at Beyrout, and Rashid Pasha should have been compelled either to eat his own words or to carry out his threat. In the latter case the convert should have been accompanied to Constantinople by a de legate from the Missions, and the Sublime Porte should have been com pelled to decide whether she would or would not abide by her Treaties and Firmans. The plea that exile was necessary to defend the convert from his own co-religionists, that banishment was for his own benefit, is simply absurd. Either the Porte can or she cannot protect her Christian converts. In the latter case they must be protected for her. Never pro bably has there been so good an opportunity for testing Turkey's profes sion of liberalism, and the Turks are too feeble and too cunning to let another present itself. In their first fright the Beyrout European Christians withdrew their protection from Hajj Hassan. On the diligence arriving at the ' Pines,' a forest about an hour before reaching Beyrout from Damascus, the con vert was ordered to dismount, and his wife and five children (one at the15 breast,) were turned adrift from the house which had protected them for some days, at nine o'clock at night to wander whither they could. Hajj Hassan was subsequently removed from Beyrout to Abeigh, an Anglo- American (U.S.) Mission station in the Lebanon, probably by the exer tions of Dr. Thomson, author of The Land and the Book, who distinguishes himself in Beyrout by daring to have an opinion and to express it, though unfortunately he stood alone and unsupported. On July 20th, Hajj Hassan was to be shipped off by night to Alexandria, where he was expected to ' find good employ.' Suddenly his passport was refused by the local authorities, and he was hidden in the house of a Consular Dragoman. The Porte had sent a secret despatch, ordering him to be transported to Crete, Cyprus, or one of the islands in the Archipelago, where his fate may easily be divined. At length a telegram arrived from Constanti nople, and the result was that, after a fortnight's detention by sickness, the Hajj Hassan was sent off by the French mail of Friday, August 1 ith. Verily, the Beyroutines are a feeble folk. They allowed themselves to be shamefully defeated by Rashid Pasha when he was grossly in the wrong. I saw at the Mission in Damascus, and obtained leave tocopy the follow ing testimonial addressed to Captain Burton, and that officer's reply. 'Damascus, 12th July, 1871. 'ToCaptain Burton, H.B.M's. Consul at Damascus. ' Sir,—We beg to tender to you our heartiest thanks for your prompt decisive action in the case of Hassan the converted Moslem, and also to congratulate you on the result of your determination and firmness. ' For some time past we had heard that a Moslem converted to Pro testantism at Beyrout had become subject to considerable persecution. A convert more obscure than himself has been put out of the way and has not since been heard of, and Hassan had been subjected to a series of arrests and imprisonments and had several times narrowly escaped as sassination. The chief Consulates however had become publicly in terested in him, so that his safety from legal execution seemed ensured ; and as he was always accompanied by some one to protect him from as sassins beseemed for the time to be safe. But on the 29th of June we were surprised to find that he was being transported to Damascus, having been arrested and bound in chains. The English colony in Beyrout became alarmed, as they declared that none so transported to Damascus ever returned again. Two agents of the Mission were despatched from Beyrout, one preceding the prisoner to give us information as to what had taken place, and the other accompanying the prisoner to watch what became of him. On receiving intelligence of the convert's transporta tion to this city, the missionaries of the three Missions at Damascus resolved to lay the case before you, but on doing so found that you had with your usual energy already taken up the case, and categorically demanded the release of the prisoners. And though the authorities ignored the Firman granting civil and religious liberty to the people of this Empire, and denied your right to interfere on behalf of the prisoner, the unflinching stand you took by the concessions of thei6 Hatti-Sherif, secured the release of the prisoner : you have thus vin dicated the cause of humanity, for on the day on which the prisoner escaped through your intervention, the Moslem authorities strangled in the Great Mosque of Damascus a Moslem convert to Chris tianity. The man had made application to the Irish American Mis sion for protection, and declared that he lived in daily fear of strangu lation. He was imprisoned in the Great Mosque, and strangled as they say by S. John the Baptist, and then carried away by one man and thrown into a hole like a dog. ' This accident proves that your uncompromising firmness with the authorities was an act of pure mercy, and that the worst apprehensions of the Beyrout missionaries were not unfounded. But more im- portant siill, you have asserted the binding character of the spiritual privileges of the Christian subjects of the Porte, contained in the Firman of 1856, and which, according to Fuad Pasha's letters to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, comprises ' absolutely all proselytes.' 'We are sure. Sir, that your conduct in this affair will receive the unqualified approbation of the best public opinion in Christendom, and we have no doubt it will receive, as it merits, the warm approval of your own Government. ' We who were near and anxious spectators of the proceedings in this affair cannot too warmly express our sense of the satisfaction with which we witnessed the fearless, firm, and efficient manner in which you conducted this important case until the convert was permitted to leave this city.

' Beludan, July 19th, 1871, ' i have the pleasure to return my warmest thanks for your letter this day received, in which you have formed so flattering an estimate of my 22 months' services as Her Majesty's Consul for Damascus. Nor must i forget to express my gratitude to you for the cordial support and appro val of my proceedings connected with your Missions which you have always extended to me. This friendly feeling has greatly helped to lighten the difficulties of the task that lay before me in 1869. You all know, and none can better know, what was to be done when i assumed charge of this Consulate ; you are acquainted with the several measuresi? talven by me, honourably I hope to our national name, and you are familiar with the obstacles thrown in my way, and with the manner in which I met them. My task will encounter difficulties for some time. Still the prospect does not deter me. I shall continue to maintain the honest independence of H. M's. Consulate, to defend our rights as foreigners in Syria, and to claim all our privileges to the letter of the law. Should I meet, and there is no fear of its being otherwise, the approval of my chiefs who know that an official life of 29 years in the four quarters of the world is a title to some confidence, I feel assured that we may look forward to happier times at Damascus when peace and security shall take the place of anxiety and depression. ' Meanwhile I recommend to your prudent consideration the present state of affairs in Syria. A movement which I cannot but characterize as a Revival of Christianity, seems to have resulted from the peculiar action of the authorities, and from the spirit of enquiry awakened in the hearts of the people. It numbers its converts by thousands, including men of high rank, and it is progressing even amongst the soldiery. ' I need hardly observe that it is the duty of one and all of us to labour in the grand cause of religious toleration, and to be watchful lest local and personal interpretations are allowed to misrepresent the abso lute rights of all converts to life and liberty. And I trust that you will find me, at the end as in the beginning, always ready to serve your interests, to protect your missions and schools, and to lend my most energetic aid to your converts.—I am, with truth and regard, yours faithfully, (Signed) ' Richard F. Burton, ' H. B. M.'s Consul, Damascus.' I am now going to suppose that all your readers are not familiar with Syria and its cities, its native and foreign officials, or its various reli gions and races. As a wanderer in this land free and independent of all employments and Governments, an impartial looker on and a student of its politics, religions, and peculiar mode of Government, I will diverge for a moment from my subject to explain a few facts. On arriving in Syria, one lands at Beyrout, a pretty town of no very great importance to the world. It is the concentration of all that Syria knows of comfort, luxury, and pleasure. Christian and semi-civilized it has its soldiers and policemen, its ships and sailors under the windows, its semi-European mode of living and manners, and its free communica tion with Lurope by telegraphs and regular mails. Steamers anchor in the open roadstead (there is no harbour, pier, or landing-place, save a few broken unclean steps leading to a small dirty custom-house quay), an occasional merchant-ship appears, and at times some wandering man- of-war. It is ruled by a governor subject to the Wali, who rules Syria, being in fact Viceroy to the Sultan. This great official lives at Damas* cus, and visits Beyrout for sea-bathing and to make holiday. It is also the residence of the Consuls-General, who represent foreign Powers and European influence, and are very great people in their way ; and also of a large European society -of the middle classes. Beyrout is backed by the high range of the Lebanon, which is inhabited by Druzes andi8 Maronites, and ruled by a separate governor, Franco Pasha, an able officer, independent of the Wali. After crossing the Lebanon and de scending into the plain of the Bukaa (Cselesyria) civilization, Christi anity, and all free communication with the outer world, are left behind ; as are comforts, luxuries, and society, whilst the traveller is completely at the mercy of Beyrout as to how much or how little he may receive of the necessary help such as man should give to his fellow-man. P or safety he is self-dependent on his own personal courage and his know ledge of the East, and woe betide the hapless one who has no friend at Beyrout, or whose Consul-General may be a little sick, or selfish or ill-tempered, or otherwise ill-disposed. He steps forth into the solemnity of Orientalism, which increases upon him during the sometimes dreary and barren 72 miles journey, and he finds himself in the heart of Oriental life in the city of Damascus. This Orientalism is the great charm of ' the Pearl of the East.' She is still pure and innocent of anything like Europeanism. However much the wanderer may dislike it at first, the life so grows upon him that, after a time, to quit it would be a wrench. But this is what makes the demi-semi-fashionable ot Beyrout hate Damascus, with a spice of fear, knowing nothing of her attractions ; whilst she, on her side, lazily despises the effeminate and, to her, luxurious and feeble Beyroutine. Damascus, I have said, is the heart and capital of Syria, the residence of the Wali and his entourage, who rule Syria' who fear the strong and who oppress the weak, who persecute Christians, who starve the people, and who fill their own pockets. If his Excellency died to-morrow the voice of Syria would go up to heaven in one loud cry of execration, embodying the popular curse upon a departed tyrant's soul, 'May the Lord have no mercy upon your resting-place ! ' Here also are the head-quarters of the army and police, the chief majlises or tribunals, which represent our Courts of Law ; business institutions and transactions have also their place in Damascus, and, being a ' Holy City,' I need not say that it is the religious chef lieu. _ Syria has always been cursed with races, tribes, and faiths enough to split up the country, and to cause all manner of confusion. 1* or instance, the Moslem is the national religion. There are the Moslem Sunnites, or orthodox of four schools, viz., the Hanifi, Shafii, Hanbeli, Maliki : the Shieh heresy locally called Metawali (of these most are Kurds) : the Nusayri (also Shiites), but their faith is little understood. The Nowar, or Gipsies, are self-styled Mohammedans. Besides these there are Shadilis or Shazilis (Dervishes), Persian ' Babis,' Chaldean \ ezidis, Ismailiyehs (Shiehs) from different parts of the East, and Wahhabis, who keep themselves in the background. The Bedouins, who are as the sands of the deserts they inhabit, are also Moslems. After the Moslems, but conforming with them, come the Druzes, who are divided into Akkal and Juhhal; which simply means ' the wise men' : and ' the foolish (young) men,' as the former lead a more rigid life than the latter. Their belief is more or less a mystery ;19 for policy's sake they affect the national religion, and they will lean to wards the faith of whatever person they may happen to address. 1 he Jews are divided into Sephardim, Askenazim, Samaritan and Karaite. Then we come to the Christians, who number 14 sects:—Maronite (Catholic), Greek Catholic, Greek Schismatic (styled ' orthodox'), Armenian Catholic, Armenian Schismatic (styled ' orthodox'), Syrian Catholic ; Jacobite, which is Syrian 'orthodox' or non-Catholic, Latin Catholics (like the French, &amp;c.), a few Protestants (from the Missions and schools of England, Chaldea, Prussia, and the United States, and their converts), Copts, Abyssinians, Chaldean Catholic and Chal dean Schismatics (styled ' orthodox'). The Catholic rites have each a liturgy different from the Latin Catholic Mass, and said in their own language; they communicate under both kinds, but there is no heresy in their belief. A French Catholic satisfies his obligations of hearing Mass on Sunday with them, but of course he cannot receive their com munion under both forms. Nineteen Europeans reside at Damascus. This is the residence of the consuls, whose districts extend to Baghdad on the East, and to Nablus on the South, and who have all the real work to do. Some suppose that they are subject to the Consulates-General at Beyrout, but this, though the Turks desire it, is highly unadvisable, as Damascus work requires prompt and decided action and no loss of time ; moreover, any order which might apply to Beyrout would be totally inapplicable at Damascus ; finally, in nine cases out of ten it would proceed from the advice of a Dragoman interested in the case, his superior not knowing Arabic, or perhaps never having seen Damascus. Upon the English Consul devolves the responsibility of the post for Baghdad, and the protection of commerce, of travellers, and of some half-dozen English residents. There are, besides the Consular corps, four missions each with its school, three European religious houses (Lazarists, Franciscans, and Sisters of Charity), an English engineer, a French sanitary officer under his own Government, and, lastly, the employh of the French Road Company. Whoever lives in Damascus must have good health and nerves, must be charmed with Oriental life, and must not care for society, comforts, or luxuries, but be totally occupied with some serious pursuit. Should he be a Consul—an old soldier is best—he must be accustomed to com mand with a strong hand. The natives must be impressed by him, and know that, if attacked, he can fight. He must be able to ride hard and to rough it in mountain or desert, in order to attend to his own work instead of sending a Dragoman or a Kawass, who probably would not really go, or if he did might be bribed. He must have the honour and dignity of England truly at heart, and he should be a gentleman to understand fully what this means ; not a man risen from the ranks, and liable to be 'bullied or bribed.' He should speak Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, as well as English, French, and Italian, so as not to take the hear-20 say of his Dragomans. He must be able to converse freely with Arabs, Turks, Bedouins, Druzes, Kurds, Jews, Maronites, Afghans, and Persians, and understand their religions and prejudices. He must have his re liable men everywhere, and know everything that goes on throughout the length and breadth of the country. He should have a thorough know- lege of Eastern character. He must keep a hospitable house. He should be cool, firm, and incorruptible. He must not be afraid to do his duty, however unpleasant and risky, and having done it, if his Chiefs do not back him up, i.e., his Consul-General, his Ambassador, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Tuikish local au thorities know he has done his duty at his own risk ; they admire and they fear the individual, but they despisehis Government whilst they fawn and cringe to it. Thus the interests of England, and English pride, are trampled in the dust. Such a man is Captain Burton, the present Consul at Damascus, and such a man is like a loadstone to the natives. Were he in no authority the country would flock to him and obey him of their own accord from his own personal influence amongst them. But this is exactly the man who does not suit the present Wali and his creatures, upon whose misrepresentations and falsehoods the Porte has demanded his recall; it is no secret, for all Syria is ringing with it, and the Wali has it proclaimed in the bazaars. I may add that all Syria is looking on with anxiety and distress lest he should be removed. No other class of man could hold his own against the present local Turkish authorities, and they would treat him like a kind of upper servant. If the Porte knew its own interests it would ask to keep the English Consul and discharge its own faithless employ^. That troubles will follow his removal, I may safely prophesy ; and that his successor will be insulted in the streets, and compelled by terror and sickness to run away from his post, is very possible. That is what we may come to. Let the name of England never more be mentioned—let her sons be incorporated with Turkish subjects, whilst Prussians and French keep their proper position and their national dignity. Now that the uninitiated will have understood something of the position of affairs, I may resume my subject. When the depo sitions of Hajj Hassan were taken at the Consulate, Damascus, he declared that a Moslem friend of his, named Hammud ibn Osman Bey, originally from Latakia (Laodicea), but domiciled at Beyrout, had suddenly disappeared, and had not been heard of for 12 days. Presently it became knoivn that Hammud, about two years ago, when in the employ of Mr. Grierson, then Vice-Consul of Latakia, was drawn for the army, but had not been called upon to serve. He was in the habit of hearing the missionaries preach, and on more than one occasion he declared that he would profess Christianity—a course from which his friends dissuaded him. Hammud determined, in the beginning of 1871, to visit Beyrout, and Mr. Grierson gave him letters of introduction to the missionaries and to the superintendent of the British Syrian schools, requesting that21 he might be taken into the service of some European family. Here he again openly committed himself by declaring that he was a Christian. His former master knowing that the eyes of the police were upon him made immediate arrangements for his leaving by the steamer to Latakia where he had been recruited, giving him at the same time a note for the colonel commanding the regiment. Hammud however, on the evening before his journey, imprudently walked out in the direction of the barracks : he was seized and put in irons—probably to be ' counselled.' Mr. Grierson when informed of this arrest at once addressed Toufan Bey. This officer is a Pole commanding one of the regiments of the ' Cossacks of the Sultan,' the other being quartered at Adrianople. Visiting the military Pasha of Beyrout he begged that as Hammud 's passage had been taken for Latakia where his name had been drawn, the convert might be allowed to proceed there. The two officers sent for the man and gave the required directions respecting him. But Ham. mud was already in the enemies' hands ; and the normal charge of de sertion was of course trumped up against him. He was sent with a member of other conscripts to the capital, with tied hands, and carrying the rations of his fellow-soldiers ; and presently a report was spread that he had been put to death. Hajj Hassan on returning to Beyrout informed Mr. Johnson, Consul- General for the United States, that during his arrest at Damascus the soldiers had threatened to 'serve him as they had served Hammudeh.' He went at once to Rauf Pasha, who replied that the man had been ar rested and sent to head-quarters because he had been conscripted two years before at Latakia and had deserted. This was directly opposed to the statement made by Mr. Grierson, namely, that the man had never been called upon to serve. Mr. Johnson could do no more, as Hammud had made himself amenable to the law of the land, and he seems not to have taken any steps to decide whether it was a bona fide desertion. He enquired however what the punishment would be, and was told that it would depend upon circumstances. Several people at Beyrout wrote to the Consul at Damascus, begging of him to institute a search for the missing man. Shortly afterwards letters were despatched from Beyrout, stating that Hammud had been found in the barracks alive and well, and contented with his condition as a soldier. What process he has been through to effect such a wonder ful change we are not informed, nor where he has been hidden during its operation. The ' Counselling ' has probably compelled the convert by brute force to conceal his convictions. Another story in the mouths of men is that a young man, the son of a Kazi or Judge, had lately suffered martyrdom at Damascus for the crime of becoming a Christian. This may possibly be a certain Said el Hamawi, who disappeared three or four years ago. Said was a man of education, and a Shaykh, who acted Khatib (or scribe and chaplain) to one of the regiments. He was convicted of having professed Chris tianity, and was sent for confinement to the capital. When let out of prison he repeated his offence, and he has never been heard of since.22 On the morning of the Saturday (July i) which witnessed the unjust sentence of exile pronounced upon Hajj Hassan, a certain Arif Effendi ibn Abd el Ghani el Nablusi was found hanging in a retired room of the Great Amawi Mosque at Damascus, where he had been imprisoned. No inquest was held upon the body, which may or may not have shown signs of violence ; it was hastily buried. Some three years before this time, Arif Effendi, a man of high family, and of excellent education, had become a Greek Christian at Athens under the name of Eustathius. Presently he reappeared in Syria as a convert, a criminal whom every good—that is to say, bigoted—Moslem deems worthy of instant and violent death. He came to the capital, and he introduced himself as a Christian to the Irish-American Presbyterian Missionaries ; to Monseigneur Yakub, the Syrian Catholic Bishop and to others; nor did he conceal from them his personal fears. He expected momentary destruction and presently he found it, being accused, truthfully or not I am unable to say, of steal ing 14 silver lamp-chains, and a silver padlock. The wildest rumours flew about the city. The few declared that the man had hanged him self. The Nablusi family asserted that, repenting his apostasy, he had allowed himself to be hanged, and the vulgar were taught to think that he was hanged by order of Sayyidna Yahya, our Lord John (the Baptist), whose head is supposed to be buried in the great Mosque It was cur rently reported that the renegade had been sent to the Algerine Amir the Sayyid Abd el Kadir who, finding him guilty of theft, had ordered him to receive 40 stripes and to be arrested in the Mosque, at the same time positively refusing to sanction his execution as his accusers de manded. This proceeding, though irregular, is not contrary to Moslem law, the Ulema claim and are allowed such jurisdiction in matters concerning the Mosque. H. M.'s Consul at Damascus, suspecting foul play, applied on the 3rd July for information upon this subject, to the Wali, who rudely refused to 'justify himself.' Eight days afterwards the Governor-General thought pro per to lay the case before the Tribunal. The result may easily be imagined. That honourable body cast the blame of the illegal imprisonment upon the Amir Abd el Kadir, whom they hate because he saved so many Christian lives in i860. They delivered a verdict that the convert had been found hanged by his own hand, they antedated a medical certifi cate that the body bore no marks of violence, and they asserted contrary to fact and truth that the deceased was decently washed and buried, whereas he was thrust into a hole like a dog. And now I will answer the qnestion prominent in every reader's mind : 'These men are Turks ; are we bound to protect them ?' I simply reply we are. It is obviously our national duty to take serious action in arresting such displays of Moslem fanaticism as those that have lately taken place in Syria. Mr. Gladstone cannot forget his own words : ' We would be sorry not to treat Turkey with the respect due to a power which is responsible for the government of an extended territory, but with refer-23 ence to many of her provinces and their general concerns, circumstances place her in such a position that we are entitled and, indeed, in many cases, bound to entertain questions affecting her internal relations to her people, such as it would be impertinent to entertain in respect to most foreign countries. ... All that we can expect is that when she has contracted legal'or moral engagements she should fulfil them, and that when she is under no engagements she should lend a willing ear to counsels which may be in themselves judicious, and which aim solely at the promotion of her interests. ... As regards the justice of the case, we must remember that as far as regards the stipulations of the Hatti-i- Humaioun, we are not only entitled to advise Turkey in her own interest, in her regard to humanity, in her sense of justice, in her desire to be a civilized European power, to fulfil those engagements, but we are also entitled to say to her that the fulfilment of those stipulations is a matter of moral faith, an obligation to which she is absolutely bound, and the disregard of which will entail upon her disgrace in the eyes of Europe. . . . We are entitled to require from Turkey the execution of her literal engagements.'—(Debate on Crete and Servia. Mr. Gre gory's motion for correspondence and Consular Reports on the Cretan Insurrection, &amp;c., as reported in the Evening Mail of Feb. 15-18, 1867.) These memorable words deserve quotation the more, as throughout the nearer East, especially among the Christian communities, England still suffers under the imputation of not allowing the interests of Chris tendom to weigh against her politics and her sympathy with the integrity of the Turkish Empire. Even if we care little for the propagation of Christianity, or for the regeneration of Asia, we are bound to see that treaties do not become waste paper. The first step to be taken in North Syria, and to be taken without delay, would be to procure the recall and the pardon of the 12 unfortu nates who were banished in 1870 to Tripoli of Barbary, and to Murzuk in Inner Africa. This will be a delicate proceeding; imprudently carried out it will inevitably cost the lives of men whose only offence has been that of becoming Christians, and it will only serve to sink their families into still deeper misery. But there should be no difficulty of success. Our Consul-General at Tripoli could easily defend the lives if not the liberties of the neophytes. Her Majesty's Ambassador Extra ordinary and Plenipotentiary at Constantinople should be directed firmly to demand that an officer of high rank be sent from head-quarters, and that he should be made duly responsible for landing the exiles in safety at Beyrout. Thence they should be transferred to Damascus ; their pre tended offences should be submitted to a regular tribunal, whose action would be watched by H. M's. Consul, and when publicly proved to be innocent these men should be restored to the bosoms of their families, whilst the police should be especially charged with their safety. This step taken, the next will naturally be to urge the instant recall of the unjust Wali or Governor-General of Syria, Mohammed RashidPasha, together with those members of the Secret Tribunal, more espe- cially the Mufattish Effendi, Mahommad Izzat, who made themselves his instruments in carrying out illegal and tyrannical measures against a body of 12 innocent men. And when the head and front of the evil shall have been removed and the limbs formally impeached, a consum mation devoutly to be desired, unless due prudence be exercised much evil may be the result. Rashid Pasha has filled every important post with his familiars and creatures ; he will doubtless leave directions after his departure for all manner of troubles to be excited, especially between Christians and Moslems, Greeks and Latins, in order to stifle the outcry which will rise from the length and breadth of the land. The remedy will be a High Commissioner, and a Firman from Constantinople couched in the strongest terms, and holding all governors and judges (Muftis and Kazis) personally responsible for any disorderly proceedings. And should they not be able to keep the peace, should any threat of repeating the horrors of i860 be heard, the nations of Europe must pre pare to keep it for them. I hus will the unhappy province—a land once flowing with milk and honey, now steeped to the lips in poverty and crime—recover from the misery and the semi-starvation under which it has groaned during the last five years. Thus also Christianity may again raise her head in her binh-place and in the land of her early increase. Thus shall England become to Syria, and through Syria to Western Asia, the blessing which Syria in the days of the early Church was to England, to Europe, and to the civilized world. Let her discharge her obligations before her God. ^ ♦ «*««♦•* P. S.—Since these sheets -went to Press I have received news that Mohammed Rashid Pasha has been recalled, and that Captain Burton is in England. This then is the moment to press for the immediate return of the 12 unjortunates exiled to M: r ztik, and to impress upon the Ottoman authorities who, since the death oj Russia's Jriend, Aali Pasha, the Grand Vizier oj pernicious fame, appear ready to rejorm a host oj abuses, that the f riendship of England can be secured only by scrupulous fidelity to treaties, especially to those which concern religious toleration.
