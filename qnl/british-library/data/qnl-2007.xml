We have ascertained from the Arab Bureau that they are entirely satisfied with ffordes work and that he is proving extremely useful to them,as indeed he is to us, moreover he himself now appears entirely content in that appointment. It has therefore been decided in view of the possibility of active operations in the near future at Aden, to keep Jacob there until the situation clears. His unique knowledge of the Aden hinterland and of the personnel of the Chiefs renderJhis presence there at such a time almost indispensible, and. his health seems to have been considerably improved by a visit to Simla. The question may therefore be postponed indefinitely for the present. Our idea had been if Jacob’s health had absolutely necessitated a change, to post Major Wood who is now working under him at Aden in Jacob’s place. I have ascertained from Colonel Clayton of the Arab Bureau, that though perfectly satisfied with fforde they would if a change was considered necessary gladly welcome Jacob as Liaison Officer in his place, and I think Jacob’s Indian experience would be quite sufficient to enable him to represent Indian interests on the /rab Bureau, 1 , i : ® 7' Albut as I have said the question must stand over for the present until the Aden situation has definitely cleared.

Secret) and Sir W. Langley's letter of the 28th ultimo (W.167563/16) further respecting the Arab Bureau at Cairo. Viscount Grey of Fallodon does not consider that India can be asked to share the cost of the Bureau nor is he prepared, for political reasons, at present to ask for a contribution towards the cost from the Egyptian Government. On the other hand My Lords presume that no charge will he made against imperial funds in respect of the assistance which it is proposed that the Egyptian Government shall render in the matter of accommodation, furniture, offices, &amp;c., and also that the salaries of officers lent or attached oy the Egyptian and Indian Governments will continue to be borne on the funds administered by those Governments. Similarly British Navy or Army Officers attached will continue to receive their Navy or Army pay. On the understanding that the questions of the permanent establishment of the Bureau and of the ultimate division of the cost of its maintenance, if it should be decided to retain it, oetween Egyptian and imperial funds are left open for consideration at the The Under secretary of State, Foreign office. 1 n I 1the end of the war, ivjy Lords will he prepared in the meantime to accept as a charge against imperial funds the expenditure required for staff, not otherwise provided for. They gather from Sir H. McMahon’s telegram of the 13th tiuly (No.577) that the Director is already provided for as an officer in the Egyptian Service hut if new appointments are necessary for the two Assistants They will not ohject to pay at the rate of £650 per annum for them as for 4 clerks at £350 and a native writer at £250. This expenditure may he met from the Diplomatic and Consular Vote as a service falling within paragraph 12(a) of the Treasury Minute of the 20th August 1914.

On the other hand, if the organisation is intended to be per manent, My Lords would have thought it desirable that the con stitution of the Bureau on a permanent footing should remain over for consideration in the light of the circumstances prevail - ing at the end of the war. If this view be adopted, all that need be done in the meantime would be the assignment of a suffi cient number of officers to assist the Director of Military In telligence to carry out the duties proposed to be discharged by him.

General Clayton, as Director of Intelligence in Egypt, to he 'ex officio' head of the Bureau, Staff to consist of:- Director at £900 a year.

Reference to your telegrams of 7th, 14th and 15tli Apul. Reuter s telegrams on this subject have been quoted in and commented on by Pi ess generally, and no further action seems necessary. AVe are somewhat diffident as to effect of these publications which can only serve to excite religious feeling and thereby possibly reinforce pro Turkish sentiment. Amir will doubtless see notices in “ Pioneer,” and it would be both unnecessary and impolitic to call his attention specially to matter. There is no real pro-German feeling in Kabul. Hostile element is rather pro- Turkish and acutely sensitive regarding Islam, any insult to which, by Germans, is liable to react on Christian powers generally. Our policy has been throughout to refrain from giving prominence to reports which might excite ira religiosa. We should like a few copies of photographic circular for our information but do not propose to publish them unless this should hereafter appear desirable.n s l° Simla 24th June 1916. J I am desired to enclose a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Hogarth, the head of the Arab Bureau in Cairo. The letter explains itself, but I shall be glad to know if in the event of the Cairo people accepting the proposed replacement of fforde by Jacob on the Arab Bureau, the India Office and Foreign Office would agree. If you would send me a telegram in answer it would simplify our arrangements out here.

So far as Indian interests are concerned I think he is doing excellently and his letters to m have been most helpful * t the sarae time we want, ©f course, to assist the rab Bureau as far as possible, and not merely to safe guard Indian interests* It has struck me therefore that possibly both in th*&gt; interests of the Bureau and in the interests of fforde himself, who my be feeling that he is rather a fish out of water, it might be desirable to send someone in ffordes place who has some direct know ledge of Arabian and rabian affairs, rind this idea has been strengthened by the fact that we may in the near future want to give Colonel Jacob, our 1st ssistant resident at den, a change of work and environment. He has been some IP years in l den and on grounds of health my require a change before long. You probably know him, if you do not I may say that he is a very first class Uie officer with a uni ue knowledge of/Aden hinterland and the Yemen, of whom successive Viceroys have held a very high opinion. He is going back to den now for r few months with a view to training an understudy, and it 1bis? possible that though he is at present indi spermbio at den his services might be spared, say in October next. I should be very glad to know whether in the event of fforde wish in; to return to India the Cairo authorities would be prepared to accept Jacob. The settlement of this matter is of some urgency as the baited Provinces Government are anxious to have some definite information regarding the prospects of ffordes return. If you mention this matter to fforde will von be kin' enough to it nito clear that we are perfectij satiefied with his work in the Bureau, ad have not the sjiBllest desire to re 1 ce him, hut that »rely in the interests of the work of the Bureau, in his evu interests, and in the interests of Jacob, the suggeste&amp; ck.ange has been contemplated# I should be .such obliged if you would send m a tolegram to say how the Hatter is viewed by Cairo# I m also writing to Hirt^el on the subject.

I am to state that Sir E. Grey concurs in the terms of the reply which Mr. Secretary Chamberlain proposes to return to paragraph (a) of the Govern- ment of India’s telegram. Copies of your letter and of this reply have been sent to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at I am, Sir, A Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Under Secretary of State for India. Cairo. if i i \In considering Mr. fforde’s case I am afraid ^ we overlooked the fact that his leave expires in April and that in ordinary course he would have had to embark for India before the end of this month. Thus it is very doubtful whether there •ft/jcs reasonable ground for giving him passage to Egypt at the public expense. The same consideration affects the present question. In your letter to Llr.fforde at* 17.3.16.you have informed him that'While employed in the Soudan Intelligence Dept.' hie pay will be Rs.25t0. This statement x eascmably be interpreted, I think, as not covering the period ql the journey to Egypt, and in the circumstances I it wquIq. De quite sufficient^! think^ to allow him for bnat period (i*e. to date of taking up his appointment)' ordinary deputation pay of two-thirds of the salary which he would receive if he were on duty in India. It is safe to assume that that salary would have been ^ &gt; ana that his deputation pay on this basis w-ojld :e an the rate of £112.10. 0. a month. There is llu case * 1 for giving him more ( md he could not . have complained if we had in the first instance required him to pay his own passage and remain on leave pay till he joined his appointment in Egypt. iff ¥ //) h + 46 1 V ry ir A- tosh. k,- 1 '' % ‘ V-t.

' 4 In my opinion the Bureau should be nominally under the Foreign )fficQ but only in so far as it will be under the control of the High Jommissioner. It should also be in close touch with the D.I.D. and 1.0.6. A London representative of the Bureau could ensure this.

Hirtzel, seconded by Brigadier-General Maurice, Brigadier-General Macdonogh took the cbair. Brigadier-General Macdonogh opened the proceedings by referring to a Memorandum by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, which had been, circulated to the members of the Conference, to serve as a basis for discussion on the constitution and functions of the proposed Bureau, and to enable the Conference to form conclusions in conformity with the reference before them. The Conference having accepted the general principle of establishing a Bureau at Cairo, Brigadier-General Macdonogh pointed out that in the first place there was an objection to the suggested title of “Islamic,” the use of which would make it appear that the functions of the Bureau would apply to the whole of Islam. This was not the case. It would be concerned only with Arabs, and he proposed that the Bureau should be entitled either Arab or Arabian. The Conference agreed that it should be called the Arab Bureau. The Conference then proceeded to consider seriatim the suggestions made in the Memorandum referred to above as to the organisation and functions of such a Bureau. Report. The Conference are agreed on the desirability of establishing an Arab Bureau for reasons which will be apparent in the consideration of its functions which follows. They are of opinion and recommend that it should be organised as a section of the 'existing Soudan Intelligence Department jn Cairo, and that it should make its report through the High Commissioner of Egypt to the Foreign Office. The additional European personnel that will be required in making this extension of the Department should be supplied by the Foreign Office in conjunction with the India Office, the War Office, and the Admiralty. The first function of the Bureau will be to harmonise British political activity in the Near East, and to keep the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Committee of Imperial Defence, the War Office, the Admiralty, and the Government of India (g, simultaneously informed of the general tendency of Germano-Turkish policy. The second function will be to co-ordinate propaganda in favour of Great Britain and the Entente among non-Indian Moslems without clashing with the susceptibilities of Indian Moslems and the Entente Powers. [155] Jflf,PRINTED AT THE EOBKIGN OPETCE BT C. B. HABBISON.— 19/11916, 2 The work of the Bureau will resolve itself as follows :—■ 1. It will supply a report as often as occasion may require, hut not less frequently than once a month, through the High Commissioner to the Foreign Office, for circulation to the Departments in London. 2.

It will supply the Government of India with material for the Anglo-Indian and the vernacular press, to be used at the discretion of the Government of India alone. 5.

It will stimulate the same feelings indirectly in Aden, Mesopotamia, and the Persian Gulf, through the political officers, or other channels approved and controlled by the Government of India. 7.
