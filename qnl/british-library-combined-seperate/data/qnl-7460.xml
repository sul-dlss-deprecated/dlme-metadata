The issue is raised following a claim by the Abdali Sultan of Lahej [Lahij] that he retains fishing rights in the sea bordering the Lahej coast up to a distance of three miles, and that Aden fisherman can only operate within those boundaries with his permission and subject to tax.There follows correspondence between the Government of India Foreign and Political Department, the Aden Chief Commissioner, and the Foreign Office, regarding the proposal that Protectorate States be treated as analogous to Indian Native States with respect to territorial waters. This position, i.e. of divided jurisdiction, with states retaining jurisdiction over non-foreign or external relation matter on a case-by-case basis, is agreed upon.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 1).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abdali Sultanate of Lahej</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Lahej</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fishing rights</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00001e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
