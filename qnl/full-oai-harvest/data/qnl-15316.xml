In the letter, William Digges Latouche and George Abraham, Residents at Bussora [Basra], report that phirmands [firmans] were received the previous month from Constantinople appointing Soliman Aga [SÃ¼leyman Agha] as Bacha of Bussora [Basra], independent of Baghdad. It is stated that the latter was subsequently appointed as Bacha of Baghdad also, but it is anticipated that there will be no change of policy to the East India Company's factory. This letter also includes extracts from letters from His Majesty's Ambassador at the Port (dated 9 and 23 November 1779 respectively), reporting on the war between England and the combined fleets of France and Spain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023598787.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
