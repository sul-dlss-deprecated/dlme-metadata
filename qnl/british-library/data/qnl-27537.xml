Light dues on 10018 tons in excess have consequently been taken into account in the statement. On the other hand, the two single trins carried out by the vessel ‘‘ r Aviatorduring January and February 1938, have not been taken into accouno in lj he statement thus reducing the light dues on 8C7B tons. 2. By setting off light dues in the above two cases, it is found that credit for Rs.72-12-0 has been passed in excess on behalf of the Admiralty. It is proposed to deduct this amount from the next claim that will be preferred against the Admiralty. Would you kindly inform them accordingly.ia3) / No. 306LI.II(5)/39.

Lear Baggallay, Would you kindly refer to Bowker’s letter of the 14th October (Ho.E. 55 61/111/34) and the copy which I enclose of a letter dated 10th November 1937 from the Political Agent, Bahrein, about the proposal tha,t the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be asked to contribute to the Persian Gulf Lighting Fund ? In view of the fact that so few of the tankships taking oil from Bahrein are actually controlled by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (and Ballantyne, the London representative of the Company confirms that this is so) it looks as though we shall have to drop the proposal to ask the Company to make an annual lump sum contribution and we are thus back at the point at which we started, i.e. the Government of India’s letter of the 17th October 1935. But the objections to acting on the lines suggested in that letter still appear to hold good (particularly the point dealt with in paragraph 4 of your H.L.Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office. letter/2. letter to Clauson of the 30th December 1935 - Do.E.7048/ 33/34) and subject to any observations which you may have to offer we are inclined to suggest to the Government of India that the matter should be held in abeyance until a decision has been reached in regard to the future administration of the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Servic e.

Dear Crombie, A question has arisen in connection with the accounts for light dues in respect of Admiralty oilers using the Shatt el Arab (India Office letters P.Z.1613/33 of the 23rd March 1933 and P.Z.1139/34 of the 22nd February 1934). As you are aware a rebate of 3 pies per ton has been allowed during the financial years 1930-31 and 1931-32, but no similar rebate is shown in respect of the dues from 1st April 1932 onwards. In paragraph 2 of the letter from the Government of India Ho. 6P &amp; L(8)-32 of the 11th January 1933 (India Office letter P.Z.5371/33 of 29th August 1933) concerning the payment of the dues in Iraq currency, it is stated - n The Government of India do not however consider ,f it necessary to grant a rebate of 11 the excess dues paid by shipping after the 1st 'April 1932 ' ' This may refer to the excess dues paid after the 1st April owing to the fact that the ne?/ rate of 5 fils per ton is slightly more than the previous one of 1 anna per ton. On the other hand the paragraph may refer to the 3 pie rebate allowed up to the 1st April, and may be intended to indicate its discontinuance. Can you clear up the point, and, if the first interpretation is correct, obtain confirmation that the rebate of 3 pies per ton has in fact been discontinued. If a reference to India is necessary, I should be glad if you would let me know. Yours sincerely. G.B. Crombie Esq., India Office, fyp / S.Y. 1. A 0 . ; 0. 4 3 2 5 OCT 19i4REFERENCE PAPER. ACCOUNTANT-GENERAL’S DEPARTTjTENT. A.G.No. 5040/34. Referred to the Political Secretary 8th May 1934. The Government of India have been furnishing yearly statements showing the Admiralty liability in respect of Persian Gulf Lighting etc.Service dues calculated to the 31st October each year. It is evident that the excess contribution that has been in process of extinction by set-off since 1st Nov.1930 will be completely adjusted during the current contribution year and that a claim will arise against that Department, as the balance in favour of the Admiralty at 31st October 1933 amounted to Rs. 11,022.1010 and the annual contribution is in the neighbourhood of Rs.30,000. In the circumstances it is desirable that the Government of India should be asked to render the usual stp.tement as soon as possible after 31st October henceforth and to show in that for the current year the adjustment of the excess payments down to 31st October 1930 and the actual sum recoverable from the Admiralty to 31st October 1934, together with details of the Account Current schedules in which debit for the latter will appear. The arrangements with the Admiralty provide for settlement in arrear and it is accordingly desirable to secure payment promptly seeing that the amount involved is about £2,300 in the full year. If the Political Secretary agrees perhaps he will take the necessary action, as the correspondence up till now has been conducted by him. (Sgd.) R.A.Janes.
