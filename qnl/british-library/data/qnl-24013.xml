He replied that she was Mrs. Abrams. I said that M rs . Abrams had not called at the Agency and had not, therefore, been asked to the Party. 2. On the 26th March 1935 T rang up Mr. Russell and said that I thought it would be well if Mr. Davies v. r ould mention the matter. Her name had not been included 0L.

The circulars are mainly to report whether the Political Agent will be ‘At Home’ for social visits or not. These visits usually took place on Friday afternoons of each month. Sometimes the circular indicates whether the Political Agent will be attending some sporting events such as tennis and golf or not. Each circular contains a list of people to be circulated to; those include British officials, members of the European community, and staff of The Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO). The invitees usually signed their initials beside their names on the lists. Sometimes the names of the invitees are accompanied by those of their wives. The circulars were sometimes about parties taking place at the Agency such as zakuski parties and cocktail parties, or about receiving a particular guest including Shaikh Hamad bin ‘Isa al-Khalifa, and the British Minister in Tehran and his wife.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000196#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
