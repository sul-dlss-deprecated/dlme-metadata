Le Rougetel to Mr. Bevin. (Received Ylth January) (No. 10) Tehran, Sir, X^th January, 1949. With reference to my despatch No. 48 of 5th February, 1947, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the following general review of events in Persia during 1947 and 1948. 2. During the past two years Persia has been emerging very slowly from the after- math of war, shaking off the hold which the Soviet Union had sought to impose in North Persia and progressively reducing Soviet penetration. This process started in 1946 with the delayed withdrawal of the Soviet occupation forces; it was continued by the removal, at the end of 1946, of the Pishevari satellite regime in Azerbaijan; and it was carried further with the rejec tion by the Majlis, in October 1947, of the proposed Soviet-Persian Oil Company for northern Persia and by the consolidation of Persia’s relations with the United States and ourselves in 1948. The reaction of the Soviet Government to Persia’s slow disentanglement of herself from their toils was, on the whole, moderate; they did, however, deliver themselves of a series of threatening representations immediately before and after the rejection of the oil agreement in October 1947 and, from January 1948 onwards, of a further series of notes protesting against the voting of a credit for the purchase in the United States of some £10 million worth of mili tary stores. 3. Coincident with this development of her international position, Persia has seen the evolution of a political tussle between Qavam on the one hand and the Shah and his supporters on the other, during the two years’ term of the 15th Majlis, which was elected in the late spring and summer of 1947. Throughout that year the scene was dominated by Qavam and interest centred on the election and instal ment of the Majlis, which consisted largely of his own followers, and on his skilful disposal of his previous undertaking to 122-52 submit to it the project for the establish ment of a Soviet-Persian Oil Company in North Persia. The year closed with the fall of Qavam and his departure from the country. The following year was chiefly conspicuous for a succession of weak and ineffectual Governments and a prolonged parliamentary deadlock following the return of Qavam from abroad and his determined attempt to force his way back to power. Throughout the period the Shah and his supporters have made no secret of their desire first to get rid of Qavam, then to prevent his return to office and at all times to strengthen the power of the Crown at the expense of the legislature. 4. The liberation of Azerbaijan in the closing days of 1946 was a first decisive step towards the frustration of the Soviet plan to establish a protectorate in North Persia following the withdrawal of the Red army in May of that year. With the sudden collapse of Pishevari and -his puppet regime, the way was clear for the restoration of the authority of the Central Government throughout the national terri tory, but the Russians did not react and were clearly biding their time in the belief that the conclusion of the oil agreement would provide them with an effective card of re-entry into Persia. The formula on which they relied for that purpose was the now familiar one of a “ joint ” operating company, which would, in fact, be entirely under their control and would give them unhindered access to all the northern provinces. 5. The actual expulsion of the Demo crats from Azerbaijan was the work of a few days, the suppression of the last remnants of their flimsy regime took a little longer, but, in the nature of things, both these tasks devolved upon the armed forces. It was they who were acclaimed by the population and in their triumphal path that the sacrificial cattle and sheep were slaughtered. When the Shah visited the province in the following spring hereceived an ovation. Qavam, on the other hand, was given no credit for this spec tacular operation, and it is doubtful how much he deserved. His negotiations with the Democrats during the previous months turned out to be an effective prelude to the climax, for when he saw how things were going he displayed characteristic skill in bringing the situation to a head, but there is little doubt that the initial impulse and the crucial decision were both taken by the Shah. Qavam was swept along by the current of events, and in Azerbaijan he was not unnaturally regarded as the man who would have sold the pass if he had been left to his own devices. He did not at any time visit the province and, in spite of a determined effort, he was unable to impose any of his candidates upon it in the general election which followed. To a man of Qavam’s ambitious temperament this experience was particularly galling, and there is no doubt that it served to widen the existing rift between him and his sovereign. If the Shah had had his way he would have dismissed Qavam there and then, but, had he done so, he could not have escaped direct responsibility for dealing with Qavam’s personal commitment to the Russians to submit the proposal for an oil agreement to the Majlis as soon as it could be constituted. In the end, reluc tantly but providentially, he agreed to allow Qavam to extricate himself and his country from their dilemma before giving him his quietus. 6. The Imperial Firman ordering the general election had been issued on 5th October, 1946, and Qavam had lost no time in getting to work in the con stituencies. By methods which are tradi tional in this country and of which he is a past master, he succeeded in securing the return of his nominees everywhere except in Azerbaijan and certain constituencies where the Shah and the army insisted on the election of candidates of their own choosing. An interesting feature of the election was that, before polling took place, a group of Qavam’s political opponents took ‘ ‘ bast 5 ’ in the precincts of the Royal Palace at Tehran by way of protest against the blatancy with which seats were being sold to the highest bidders. For obvious reasons polling was delayed in Azerbaijan and also in Fars, where the general amnesty of the Qashqai and their allies in the tribal revolt of the previous autumn was followed by some hard bargaining over Qavam’s candidates, who were eventually returned. By July some 110 Deputies had been elected, of whom ninety undertook to sup port Qavam, and the interminable process^ of scrutinising electoral mandates and # electing officers began. 7. By the end of September it was nearly complete, but, in the meantime, the Soviet Ambassador had not been idle. Early in August he reminded Qavam that action on his undertaking was now overdue and con fronted him with the text of an agreement embodying the provisions enumerated in the letters exchanged between them fifteen months before. He warned him that he and his country were at the parting of the ways; they would have the Soviet Union’s closest friendship and support if the agree ment were ratified, but, if it were not, they must prepare themselves to be treated as C£ blood enemies.” Qavam replied that he was bound only to submit proposal to the Majlis and could not determine the result. Notwithstanding the fact that the Chamber was packed with his personal supporters, it was already fairly clear that it would not have allowed even him to force the agreement through if he had wished to do so. Truth and expediency, therefore, went hand in hand, but Qavam’s main con cern at this stage was to clear himself in the eyes of his countrymen and to hold on to office after the rejection of the agree ment. His first move in the Majlis was to submit to it a report on the circumstances leading up to the exchange of letters, and in it he sought to demonstrate that, although under strong pressure, he had acted in the best interests of the country. He did not recommend either the accep tance of the agreement or its rejection, but suggested referring it to a committee. In the event on 23rd October a single article resolution was passed under double urgency procedure with only one dissentient voice. The provisions of this resolution were as follows :— (a) The Qavam-Sadishikov exchange of letters in 1946 was considered null and void and without effect, although it was stated that the Prime Minister had acted in good faith in undertaking the discussions. (b) A technical and scientific survey of oil deposits should be undertaken by the Government within a period of five years, so that the Majlis might make arrangements, in the form of laws, for the commercial exploita tion of these deposits.(c) No oil concessions should be granted to foreigners nor any companies established with foreign share holding for the purpose of exploit ing Persia’s oil resources. (d) The Government might negotiate with the Soviet Government for the sale of any oil found in Northern Persia under (b) above. (e) The Government should undertake negotiations and measures to “ redeem the rights of the nation ” regarding the country’s resources in instances where these rights had been impaired,” especially regard ing the oil in the south.” 8. The final paragraph, as originally drafted, contained specific references to Bahrein and to the Anglo-Iranian conces sion. These were subsequently dropped, but they were soon to crop up again in another form and in another place. The passage of the resolution induced a wide spread sense of relief not unmingled with apprehension. The Russian reaction was remarkably moderate, almost ominously so. There were two stern notes of protest in November and violent press and wireless attacks on Qavam. The latter was already confronted by a rising tide of opposition at home, largely sponsored by the Shah, whose resentment and jealousy could no longer be restrained. Qavam’s Democrat Party was split, his majority in the Majlis crumbled away and eventually, at the beginning of December his entire Cabinet resigned, leaving him completely isolated. Shortly before this happened Qavam delivered a broadcast to the nation on 1st December in which he sought to vindicate himself. He severely criticised the Military Govern ment of Azerbaijan, and it was felt that some of his allusions were directed against the Shah. It was this belief which led to the resignation of his Cabinet. One feature of the broadcast, which he repeated in an address to members of his party two days later, was a reference to the restitu tion of Persian rights in Bahrein and in the oil of the south. This repeated echo of the concluding sentences of the resolution rejecting the oil agreement was certainly not fortuitous. In part it may have been inspired by a desire to rally the forces of the Left in this country and to curry favour with the Russians, but there is no doubt that it was also intended to embarrass the British, on whose support Qavam had counted to persuade the Shah to retain him 122-52 in office. After an unsuccessful attempt to secure a majority in the Majlis, he resigned himself to the inevitable and in the closing days of the year he left the country for Europe. 9. Qavam left behind him a newly con stituted Majlis of his own choosing which was in no way united, even in its allegiance to himself, and was largely composed of time-servers who had been prepared to pay his price. They were devoid of any con structive purpose, filled with self-satisfac tion at having thrown out the oil agree ment and armed with powers designed to make of their Chamber a brake on all initiative. After the President of the Majlis—^a supreme nonentity—had failed in his attempt to form a Government, the Shah prevailed upon a veteran politician, Ibrahim Hakimi, to do so. The result was not impressive and it was generally believed that the new Government would be a mere stop-gap. It was, however, gradually built up and strengthened and lasted until June. Hakimi’s first concern was to abolish some of the more flagrant abuses of the previous regime, in particular military government and administrative extravagance. He also lived up to his promise to turn a deaf ear to the agitation about Bahrein, which was just developing. On the positive side, he earmarked for capital works a gradually increasing pro portion of Anglo-Persian royalties, which were previously used to swell current revenue. This decision was based upon a report prepared for Qavam by Dr. Mosharraf Naficy, who had been entrusted with the task of working out a Seven-Year Plan of economic and social development. This report was published in January and foreshadowed legislation to establish and finance a semi-autonomous organisation for the execution of the plan. 10. At the end of January 1948 a strongly worded note of protest was received from the Soviet Government com plaining of the activities of the United States Military Mission in Persia and claiming that they constituted a potential threat to the Soviet Union. The note con tained an ominous reference to the 1921 Soviet Treaty with Persia, which provided, in certain circumstances, for the occupa tion of one country by the military forces of the other. The Persian Government at once replied categorically denying the truth or relevance of this charge. Two months later there was a further similar exchange b 24 of notes, and the advisability of communi cating the whole correspondence to the Security Council was subsequently dis cussed, but, by the end of the year no action had been taken. 11. In the early days of the year the Shah informed the United States and British Ambassadors in strict confidence of his wish to modify the Constitution by extending the prerogative so as to include, in certain circumstances, the right of veto and dissolution and the right to appoint and dismiss Ministers. These changes were modelled on Constitutions in force in certain European countries, notably in Sweden; and in view of the irresponsible attitude of the Majlis were not, in them selves, unreasonable. But it was felt that the time was not ripe to introduce them, and the Shah was advised to hold his hand. Unfortunately, His Majesty also discussed the project with others, who were less careful to respect his confidence, and before long an agitation against the threat of “dictatorship” began to develop. The prime movers in this were a popular mullah, Seyyid Abol Ghassem Kashani, and Seyyid Zia, the veteran politician and journalist, who was arrested by Qavam and had just been released. This agitation soon gathered strength and was exploited by the Tudeh Party and other Left-wing elements to undermine the Shah’s authority and to estrange him from his people. Fuel was added to the flame early in February with the mysterious murder of a Radical journalist, Mohammad Maz’oud, who had criticised the court and the army with great temerity and was widely believed to have been the victim of their revenge. Combined with the vacillation of the Government and the deliberate futility of the Majlis, all this was most conducive to the spread of Communist doctrine and there is good reason to believe that the party has not been slow to take advantage of it. 12. Soon after the Persian New Year in March the Government was considerably strengthened by the accession of four new Ministers, including a former Prime Minister, Soheily, and two members of Qavam’s last Administration, and in spite of the further acrimonious exchanges with the Soviet Government to which reference has been made, it became apparent that the Russians had decided to change their tactics. For the first time in nearly six months the Soviet Ambassador emerged from his retreat and was to be seen at public functions. He also paid a visit to Meshed to inspect Soviet establishments there, and perhaps to get first-hand know ledge of the security zone which had been ^ established at the end of 1947 by the General Staff inside the national frontiers for the purpose of preventing political infiltration. Early in May trade talks were started with the Russians and they have continued intermittently ever since, but so far without any tangible result. 13. Soon after the return of Qavam from abroad in May it became clear that the situation had changed. Instead of gather ing strength Hakimi encountered mounting opposition in the Majlis and his deter mined and exceptionally honest Minister of Finance, M. Hadjm, became one of the chief targets for frustrated circumventors of the law. Early in June the Government fell, and on 13th June, to the accompani ment of several days of hostile street demonstrations organised by Kashani, the Hajir Government was formed. As Minister of Finance under Qavam the new Prime Minister had earned a reputation for ability, intelligence and sincerity, and he was known to be in the close counsels of the Shah and to share many of His Majesty’s views. High hopes had been placed on him, but he turned out to be entirely devoid of leadership and con stantly under attack for being a court nominee; during his five months’ tenure of office he achieved next to nothing. 14. On 18th July the Shah left the country for an absence of nearly six weeks, during which he spent just over a fortnight in England and the remainder of the time in France, Switzerland and Italy. He travelled to and from England in a York aicraft provided by the Royal Air Force Transport Command, and while in England spent two nights at Buckingham Palace as the guest of Their Majesties the King and Queen. There is no doubt that this journey has been a liberal education for the Shah, who had previously seen little of the outside world apart from his school days in Switzerland. At the same time it has brought home to him in no uncertain manner how much there is to be done in this country before the conditions of life can be considered even remotely tolerable, if judged by Western standards. After some misgiving at the start, local reactions to the journey have been quite favourable and, in spite of the Shah’s instructions to the contrary, he was given a spectacular welcome on his return.5 15. The concluding months of the year have produced little but frustration and apprehension. By the end of October, in |^Bpite of repeated votes of confidence, Hajir was brought to a complete standstill by the Majlis, where Qavam’s supporters insisted on boycotting all legislation until the Chamber had withdrawn charges of cor ruption which had been brought against him during his absence from the country. His opponents were convinced that, once acquitted, Qavam would not rest until he had forced his way back into power and, led by the Shah, they resolutely refused to allow a final vote to be taken in his case. Thus the deadlock was complete. During November, however, Hajir was succeeded by Mohammed Sa’ed, an elderly diploma tist who had been Prime Minister in 1944. After a slow start Sa’ed has consolidated his position and has apparently agreed to allow a vote to be taken in Qavam’s case, provided that the budget for the balance of the fiscal year is voted first. With the voting of immediately necessary funds one part of this bargain has been kept, but it still remains to be seen whether Sa’ed will implement the other, or whether he intends to spin matters out so as to prevent Qavam from freeing himself in time to control the next general election, which is due to take place in the spring.
