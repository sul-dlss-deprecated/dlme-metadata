This correspondence is primarily from the Resident's native agents stationed throughout the Gulf at Bahrein [Bahrain], Lingah [Bandar-e-Lengeh], Muscat, Shargah [Sharjah], and Shiraz. It also contains translations of correspondence received from various rulers across the region; such as Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr], Chief of the Joasmees [Āl Qāsimī]; and the Imam of Muscat, Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd. Primarily the subject matter consists of updates on recent events in Nejde [Najd], Oman, and Persia.More specifically for Persia, this includes political disturbances related to the declining authority of Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar, and military preparations at Shiraz for a contest over the succession between Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā (Governor of Fars) and his brother the Prince Royal, Abbas Mirza [‘Abbās Mīrzā]; interrupted by the death of the latter. Reports on the movements of key figures, and outbreaks of disease are also common.The extension of Wahabee [Wahhabi] power over Oman, and their conflict with Bahrein is also covered. The Wahabee are attempting to reduce the Shaikhs of Bahrein to submission, along with the rest of Oman; other efforts to resist the Wahabees are also mentioned (such as those of the Imam of Muscat), as are repeat outbreaks of war between the Joasmee and Beniyas tribes; on both land and sea. The events surrounding the murder and usurpation of Shaikh Tahnoon [Ṭaḥnūn bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān], Chief of the Beniyas [Bani Yas], by his brothers, Khuleefa bin Shakeboot [Khalīfah bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān] and Sultan bin Shakeboot [Sulṭān bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān], are also covered.Incidents of piracy and efforts to affect the restitution of plundered property are reported on, as is the conveyance of correspondence, and packets throughout the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prince-Governor of Fārs, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Lingah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Crown Prince of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Shiraz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Wahabi (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Bani Yas (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrein</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aboothabee</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sheraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nejde</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Blockade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000022#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
