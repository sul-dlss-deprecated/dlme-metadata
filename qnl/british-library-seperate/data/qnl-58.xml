However, much of the content has been weeded, and is no longer present in the file; this is indicated by gaps in the file's pagination sequence.The remaining content includes some instructions to the Resident, concerning a stop-off he made at Muscat during his return from Bombay to Bushire early in 1822, along with a dispatch from Henry Willock, HM Chargé d'affaires at the Court of Persia, concerning the deterioration of his situation at Tehran as a result of arrears in the Persian Subsidy. It also includes a letter from the Bombay Government removing William Bruce from his position as Resident at Bushire at the end of 1822, for negotiating an unauthorised treaty at Shiraz with the Persian authorities there.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Crown Prince of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Persia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Political and Services Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Mirza Abdul Mahab</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sheraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Tehrān</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Abolition of slavery</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000159.0x000016#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
